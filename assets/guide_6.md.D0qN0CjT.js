Olhanense. Club career Born in Johannesburg, South Africa to Portuguese parents, Silva was a young Portuguese football talent with a lot of expectations for signing his first professional contract with 1st division S.C Olhanense at 17 years old. The first four years as a senior in the Portuguese 3rd and Second league, representing CDR Quarteirense, S.C. Farense, Estrela de Vendas Novas and S.C.U. Torreense all on loan from Portuguese 1st Division team S.C Olhanense. He was then called up for Portuguese National under 21 team in which they had a victory over Ireland and a draw against Denmark. In January 2013 he signed with 2nd Division Greek club Anagennisi Epanomi FC on a settled transfer fee, making his professional debut on the 27th by playing the full 90 minutes in a 0‚Äì2 away loss against Iraklis Thessaloniki F.C. for the second level championship. In the summer of 2014, after joining one season with former Second division (Championship) side Farense, Silva was linked to 1st Division Portuguese team Braga but completed a move abroad again, joining 1st Division team Zawisza Bydgoszcz. Here he won his first trophy, the Polish Supercup, and made his debut in the Europa league the same season against Zulte from Belgium. Ahead of the 2015 season in Norway, Silva joined the Norwegian Premiership team Bod√∏/Glimt. Silva failed his medical examination when joining Bod√∏/Glimt and was sent back to Spain. But Bod√∏/Glimt changed their mind and signed him anyway before the transfer window closed. Silva needed time to reach match fitness and didn't get his opportunity. His only obligatory game for Bod√∏/Glimt was as a substitute in the 2nd round match against Mj√∏lner in the Norwegian Cup. In August 2015 Silva and Bod√∏/Glimt agreed to terminate his contract so he could join Viktoria 1889 Berlin.

Problems with these muscles allow gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) to happen. The procedure was developed by Endostim, based in St. Louis, Missouri, and Amsterdam, Netherlands.  Technique  EndoStim therapy directly targets the weak lower esophageal sphincter (LES) muscle, without altering anatomy or using mechanical constraints. EndoStim's proprietary technology uses functional electrical stimulation (a type of neuromodulation) to restore esophageal function, thereby reducing GERD symptoms. Tiny pulses of electric current are delivered to the LES without causing any sensation. The implantable pulse generator (IPG) and bipolar lead deliver therapy to the lower esophageal sphincter. The IPG is a small device similar to a pacemaker and is implanted under the skin of the abdomen. The lead connects two electrodes from the IPG to the esophagus. Both the IPG and lead are placed laparoscopically through a short, minimally-invasive procedure under general anesthesia. The implantation procedure lasts approximately 40 minutes, and involves attaching two small electrodes from the lead to the lower esophagus. The lead is brought out into a small pocket located under the abdominal skin and connected to the stimulation device (IPG). Minimally-invasive procedures have been shown to dramatically reduce healing time as well as reduce procedure risk. The first clinical study using EndoStim technology was published in 2010, showing that in patients with GERD, electrical stimulation therapy significantly and consistently increased LES pressure. An open-label trial conducted in Chile showed the procedure showed ‚Äúsignificant and sustained improvement in GERD symptoms, esophageal pH, and reduction in proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) usage without any side effects‚Äù in patients.  Usage  Endostim therapy is currently not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) though clinical trials to pursue approval are on. The procedure, however, received the CE mark allowing implants in Europe. Endostim is carried out in Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Brazil, Hong Kong, India, Denmark, Germany, Netherlands and Switzerland.

Background Ishiguro was born in Tokyo. His father, Ishiguro Tadanori was the Commander-in-chief of the medical corps of Imperial Japanese Army, and president of the Japan Red Cross. He graduated from the predecessor to Kagoshima University before obtaining a degree in law from Tokyo Imperial University in 1908. On graduation, he was accepted into the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce. Active in literary circles, he was a member of a coterie established by Nitobe Inaz≈ç, with Yanagida Kunio as one of its members. In 1914, the ministry sent him to Europe to study agricultural policies, and he rose to the position of chief of the Agricultural Policy Bureau in 1919. In 1924, he turned to agricultural reform by publishing a survey on tenant farming practices and sponsoring a bill for mediation in tenant farmer disputes,Vanoverbeke.

Page 168 He then served as director of the Silk Bureau. In 1931, he was promoted to undersecretary of Agriculture. However, he retired from the ministry in 1934, subsequently serving as president of a Rural Welfare Association. However, Ishiguro was selected by Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe to become Minister of Agriculture and Forestry in 1940. During this time, he was very active in promoting rural relief measures,Chamlbers. Miti and the Japanese Miracle. Page 89 and also served as Immigration Association President and Chairman of the Japan Agricultural Research Institute. He also strove to implement agriculture reforms and tenant farmer relief measures to Manchukuo, where many Japanese farmers had resettled.Waswo. Farmers and Village Life in 20th Century Japan. Page 180 However, Ishiguro was adamantly opposed to the Tripartite Alliance of Japan with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. Ishikugo resigned in 1941, citing illness. His father died the same year, and per the provisions of his father‚Äôs will, he did not inherit the kazoku peerage title of viscount held by his father. In January 1943, he was granted a seat in the House of Peers in the Diet of Japan. In 1945, he returned to the cabinet as Minister of Agriculture and Commerce under the Suzuki administration. In 1946, after the surrender of Japan, as with all members of the prewar and wartime Japanese government, Ishiguro was purged by the American occupation authorities. Following the occupation of Japan, in 1952 Yoshino successfully ran for a seat from the Shizuoka Prefecture constituency in the House of Councillors of the Diet of Japan. He served on the Research Commission on the post-war Constitution of Japan, as well as president of the National Farmers Federation, director of the National Chamber of Agriculture, and other agricultural-related organizations; however, he refused any key positions in national politics. His promotion of social activism by bureaucrats in the ministry to favor small farmers came to be known as ‚ÄúIshiguroism‚Äù within the Japanese bureaucracy.Chalmers. Miti and the Japanese Miracle.

Attarsiya was a 15th‚Äì14th century BCE military leader of Ahhiya.Spelling often varies based on the specific source, alternative forms include: Attar(a)s(h)iya(s), Attar(a)s(h)ija(s). In the Hittite archives of circa 1400 BCE, he is described as a \\"man of Ahhiya\\", a country identified with the Achaeans and Mycenaean Greece.. The campaigns of Attarsiya, as well as his conflict with the Hittite vassal, Madduwatta, represent the first recorded Mycenaean Greek military activity on the Anatolian mainland,. as well as the first conflict between Achaeans and Hittites.. He finally withdrew from Anatolia after Hittite intervention, but later launched a campaign against Alashiya (Cyprus). Contemporary Hittite accounts about the campaigns of Attarsiya and the Ahhiya in general may indicate that there was a possible Mycenaean empire centered on late Bronze Age Greece.. Moreover, Attarsiya might be a possible Hittite reconstruction of the Greek name Atreus, a king of Mycenae according to Greek mythology. Background The activities of Attarsiya are recorded in the Hittite archives, in particular in the Indictment of Madduwata. He is described as a \\"man of Ahhiya\\", which was a typical Hittite way to refer to an enemy king. This makes Attarsiya the first known Achaean leader, but his exact authority inside the Achaean world remains unclear. The Hittite descriptions seem to agree that he was a local Achaean ruler in western Anatolia, rather than a High king of all the Achaeans.. Moreover, the chronology of the correspondent Hittite texts was initially estimated at the end of the 13th century BCE. However, more recent research, based on a number of archaic characteristics the specific texts feature, place it together with the events described circa two centuries earlier (end of 15th-beginning of 14th century BCE).. On the other hand, no relevant information is found in the contemporary Greek Linear B records. The latter, dealing only with administrative issues of the Mycenaean palaces, are of limited value concerning the political developments of the late Bronze Age era.. Moreover, although the title of the Mycenaean kings, the wanax, has been read several times in the Linear B texts, no correspondent personal names have been found.. Military campaigns=Anatolia Boar's tusk helmets were typical of Mycenaean warfare. The campaigns of Attarsiya in Anatolia must have had a certain impact on the local population, since a depiction of a soldier wearing such a helmet was found in the Hittite capital, Hattusa. The Hittite archives of circa 1400 BCE, during the reign of Arnuwanda I, describe the military campaign of Attarsiya in southwest Anatolia,. probably in the region of Lycia. The Achaean expedition in Anatolia is associated with increased Mycenaean findings in Milet during this period (early 14th century BCE), indicating that a number of Greek people moved from mainland Greece to this region.. Attarsiya probably used the city of Miletus, in west coast Anatolia, which was already under Achaean influence, as a military base. Attarsiya launched a campaign deploying an army that included 100 war chariots and attacked regions which were Hittite vassals, or at least under a certain decree of Hittite influence. Among them, he attacked the Hittite vassal, Madduwatta, likely a prince of the kingdom of Arzawa, and managed to expel him from his country. The latter found refuge in the court of the Hittite ruler and was installed by him as a vassal in Zipasla, somewhere in western Anatolia. Attarsiyas launched a second attack against Madduwatta and managed again to defeat him. The Hittite vassal was unable to provide any opposition and managed. As a result of Achaean military activity in the region, the Hittites dispatched an army under Kisnapli. The Indictment of Madduwatta gives a brief description of the battle: The way the conflict is described, by counting only two casualties, may point that there was a duel between the nobles of the two sides. However, it is also possible that the dead among the common soldiers were not considered important to mention. Although the outcome of the battle remained unresolved, Attarsiya decided to withdraw his troops from the battlefield. After his retreat from the Anatolian mainland, Madduwatta was again installed as a Hittite vassal in the region. Alashiya Later, Attarsiya, still posing a threat to the Hittites, invaded the island of Alashiya (Cyprus) together with a number of his Anatolian allies, including his former enemy Madduwatta. This worried the Hittites since they considered the island one of their dependencies. The campaign was launched while the Lukka people of southern Anatolia provided the necessary naval support. The invading force finally succeeded in controlling Alashiya and overthrowing the local Hittite authorities.. The Mycenaean presence in Cyprus is also associated with archaeological evidence, since Mycenaean Greek settlements dating from that time were unearthed there. Legacy The campaigns of Attarsiya represent the earliest recorded Mycenaean Greek military activity on the Anatolian mainland, as well as the first conflict between Achaeans and Hittites. It appears that these military developments had a certain impact on the local populations. In this context, a decorated shard of pottery from the Hittite capital, Hattusa, depicts a warrior with body armor and boar's tusk helmet, typical of Achaean warfare, while the Hittite king offers a Mycenaean type thrusting sword to the Storm God, Teshub.; . Despite the withdrawal of Attarsiya after the Hittite intervention, the following decades (circa 1380-1320 BCE) were a period of Mycenaean expansion on the Anatolian coast.. Achaean military activity in the region continues to be attested through several Hittite records until circa 1250 BCE. Link with mythical Atreus It has been suggested by several scholars that the term Attarsiya might be a possible Hittite reconstruction of the Greek name Atreus, a mythical king of Mycenae and father of Agamemnon.; . However, other scholars argue that even though the name is probably Greek, since he is described as an Ahhiya and connected to Atreus, the person carrying the name is not necessarily identical to the famous Atreus of Greek mythology.; West suggests that Atreus is a secondary form based on the patronymic Atre√Ødƒìs, which is in turn derived from the Mycenaean *AtrehiƒÅs. According to an alternative view presented by Hittitologist Albrecht Goetze, Attarsiya might possibly be a possessive adjective, meaning \\"belonging to Atreus\\" (Atreides), which was a typical Homeric term to refer to the sons of Atreus, Agamemnon and Menelaus, throughout the Iliad. British scholar Martin Litchfield West suggested that Atreus is a shorter form of an older Greek Bronze Œëge era name, more closely connected with Attarsiya, like Atresias, Atersias or Atarsias.. Possibility of a Mycenaean empire It has been established in modern scholarship that the Hittite term Ahhiya (or Ahhiyawa in latter texts) refers to Mycenaean Greek territory and its inhabitants, the Achaeans, one of the names that Homer used to refer to the Greeks in the Iliad. Historically important about the Achaeans in the time of Attarsiya is that they undertook an expedition to Anatolia, as well as Cyprus. The latter expedition indicates that the Achaean leader commanded a significant fleet and that the Achaeans were a sea power. According to the Hittite inscriptions, it appears that the Ahhiya were a powerful empire, at the same scale as contemporary Egypt, Assyria and the Hittite Empire. Moreover, based on the fact that Attarsiya launched a military campaign in Anatolia and fielded one hundred chariots, in addition to infantry, Dutch researcher Jorrit Kelder suggested that Ahhiya must have had the military capacity of at least three times the size of the Mycenaean kingdom of Pylos, based on the information recorded on the Linear B tablets unearthed from the specific palace. Based on this view, the Achaeans under Attarsiya may have formed some kind of alliance which included several Mycenaean kingdoms..

Indira Krishna plays the role of the mother-in-law and Dutch actress Sippora Zoutewelle plays the daughter-in-law in the serial Plot This show portrays the story of the Desai family and their firangi bahu Camili. Featuring key social issues like alcoholism, cultural prejudice, abortion and modern Indian family values; the plot follows the couple from their romantic university days in London to the not-so-ideal reality of a multi-generational household in India, The Desai's. Core changes in Hindustani culture, like the rejection of family-arranged marriages and modern romantic ideas promoting love-matches, serve to highlight the real-life adaptation of cultural views regarding family happiness in a more global India. The tension between traditional and modern family values divides the family as the couple tries and eventually fails to obtain genuine family approval without inuring deep-seated prejudice, personal injury and social conflict. Corruption and dishonesty poke at deeply emotionalized cultural differences when Camili's younger sister in law asks for her help only to twist her own tawdry karma into malicious family slander aimed at the firangi bahu. In a dramatic display of black magick, family cultural pressure and cowardliness, others in the Desai family begin to conspire against Camili when a traditional paternal Auntie comes to visit. This mother-in-law and daughter-in-law drama takes a nail-biting turn when the Desai elder Auntie plots to break up the marriage. The elder Auntie unjustifiably calls Camili out publicly as a liar, belittles her, accusing Camili of eating meat, then of having a gambling addiction, and finally of hiding an abortion and conspiring for a divorce. The mounting family tension spells doom for the innocent and unwitting Camili. Fate folds as the malevolent curse strikes and Camili dies in A bus explosion forcing the whole family to admit their own truths or be haunted by her unrelenting memory. BUT THEN....details are revealed while the family recovers from the loss of Camili that the Desai elder Auntie is eager to re-wed Pranay to the daughter of a family friend, who comes to stay with the Desai family. Just as grief lifts from the house a new revelation changes everything, when a survivor of the bus bombing slowly begins to remember that she's the Friangi bahu, Camili!!!

History  The first intensive care unit (ICU) in the Australasian continent was formed in Auckland, New Zealand in 1958 at the Auckland Hospital. The first ICU in Australia was formed in 1961 in St. Vincent's Hospital in Melbourne. Since those early beginnings, the specialty of intensive care medicine quickly grew, culminating in the formation of the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society in 1975, and the subsequent negotiations in setting up formal training and accreditation of intensivists as a medical specialty. The latter efforts eventually bore fruit in 1976 with the establishment of two training pathways for intensivists administered separately by the Royal Australasian College of Physicians (RACP) and what was then-known as the Faculty of Anaesthetists of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons (RACS) (the Faculty of Anaesthetists will eventually become the Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists or ANZCA in 1992). The National Specialist Qualification Advisory Committee formally recognised intensive care as a primary medical specialty in 1980. This recognition has been updated with the present-day Australian Medical Council. The development of intensivist training took a further step in 2001, with the establishment of the Joint Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine (JFICM). This was an amalgamation of the RACP and ANZCA intensivist training pathways, with administration of the new Joint Faculty provided by ANZCA. CICM came into being in 2008, after further work on creating an independent medical specialty college. The JFICM was broken off from ANZCA and received statutory recognition as a medical specialty college in its own right in 2008.

During his career, he won almost 10,000 fights, the first one when he was just 19 years old and the last one when he was 72. He is considered the strongest Czech and a legendary symbol of strength for many Czechs.  Biography  Fri≈°tensk√Ω was born as one of six children of Kate≈ôina and Alois Fri≈°tensk√Ω in the village of Kamhajek, today a part of K≈ôeƒçho≈ô near Kol√≠n. When he was seven years old he already rode the horses and plowed the fields. At fourteen, his parents sent him to learn to be a blacksmith. During a dispute in the workshop, one of his fellow apprentices passed him an incandescent horseshoe, which caused him serious burns of his hand. After three months of home remedies his father decided to let him learn to be a butcher. After training, he left for Brno, where he worked in the butchery of Moritz Soffer. While in Brno, he started to attend local Sokol and Hellas sports clubs. In 1900, The Hellas athletic club sent him to Vy≈°kov to fight with the best wrestlers from Central Moravia. He won. The same year, he also won his first international competition, which was held in Prague. Three years later, he became the amateur European champion in Greco-Roman wrestling when he won in Rotterdam. After returning home he found out that he had lost his job as a butcher's apprentice and decided to start a career as a professional wrestler. In the following years (before World War I), he travelled and competed across the world, including Southern and Northern America (he fought with Frank Gotch, George Lurich and Gus Schoenlein (\\"Americus\\"), among others). He lost some fights, but not too many. In 1917 he resided in Litovel, along with his wife Miroslava. In 1929, when he was almost 50 years old, he became the professional European champion when he won in Prague's Lucerna. He also appeared in the title role of the film Pra≈æsk√Ω kat (The Hangman of Prague). Along with his brother, he also purchased a farm in Lu≈æice near ≈†ternberk. The town was a part of the Sudetenland and their farm was confiscated by Germans after the Munich Agreement in 1938. In 1943, during the World War II, Fri≈°tensk√Ω joined the resistance movement in Olomouc, however, he was imprisoned and his wife had to bribe a Nazi prison commander to free him. At the end of the war, their farm was ransacked when the soldiers of the Red Army resided there. It was later collectivized by the Communist authorities. In 1947, he became a widower. Fri≈°tensk√Ω was very impoverished in his later years and had to sell his trophies to survive. In 1956, he received the title Merited Master of Sports. He died in April 1957 in Litovel, where he is buried.

While the mutiny itself was localized and quickly suppressed, it undermined the South Arabian Federation which had been organized by Britain in 1959 as an intended successor to direct colonial rule. Background In 1962 the British Crown Colony of Aden became partially self-governing, before being incorporated into the Federation of South Arabia the following year. In addition to British units, Aden and the hinterland territories making up the Protectorate were garrisoned by a number of locally recruited units under British and Arab officers. On 1 June 1967 these were amalgamated to form the South Arabian Army (SAA). Since 1931 a gendarmerie style force called the Aden Armed Police had been responsible for maintaining order in Aden itself. By 1967, relations between the residual British administration and the Arab population of Aden had become increasingly tense following the Six-Day War. With British withdrawal from Aden pending, nationalist sentiment and concern for their own future spread amongst the personnel of the locally recruited army and police units organised by the British. This was exacerbated by the suspension of three Arab colonels. Two rival nationalist groups: the National Liberation Front (NLF) and the Front for the Liberation of South Yemen (FLOSY) competed for influence amongst the Aden population at large. The loyalty of the indigenous military and police to both the Federation and to their remaining British officers became uncertain. Mutiny On the morning of 20 June 1967 Arab soldiers of the South Arabian Army mutinied setting fire to their barracks. They then attacked a truck containing men of 60 Squadron RCT, killing eight of the soldiers. The SAA mutineers then attacked Radfan Camp, killing a soldier, two policemen and a civil servant.Wilson, Derek. \\"Aden's Crater declares a UDI.\\" Sunday Times [London, England] 25 June 1967: 3. The Sunday Times Digital Archive. Web. 18 April 2014. British troops of the King's Own Royal Border Regiment and the Queen's Dragoon Guards subsequently put down the SAA mutiny, rescuing officers from the camp guardroom. However unrest had spread to the Aden Armed Police who seized their barracks in the Crater District of Aden and fired from windows on a passing patrol of 2 Land Rovers carrying British troops, killing all except for one young soldier, Fusilier John Storey, who fled to a nearby apartment block and held a family hostage for 3 hours until back-up returned (John Storey later recounted the incident on the 1985 ITV Programme \\"End of Empire\\" and a more detailed account in a documentary \\"Britain‚Äôs Small wars - a look at Aden\\" in 2007.). The AAP, together with armed nationalist fighters, then proceeded to occupy Crater. Twenty-four people, including 17 British soldiers had been killed in a series of separate clashes throughout the day. Reoccupation of Crater District and aftermath On 3 July 1967, the newly arrived Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders reoccupied Crater with minimal casualties and remained in control of the district for the five months remaining until the final British withdrawal from Aden. On 7 November the SAA, now renamed the Arab Armed Forces of Occupied South Yemen, rallied to the National Liberation Front in a brief civil war with FLOSY. Following the NLF victory, the former SAA and AAP became the regular armed forces of the newly independent People's Democratic Republic of Yemen. The significance of the mutiny lay less in its immediate impact, which was limited to part of Aden town itself and quickly contained, than its clear illustration of the fragility of the South Arabian Federation. Intended as a conservative grouping of Crown Colony and inland Federation of local rulers, the Federation could not hope to survive the withdrawal of British forces.

Friedman. The film follows the title character of Milly Niceman, a young tomboy who is unhappy with the traditional expectations for her gender and longs to become a boy so she can act however she wants. Initially released as I Was a Teenage Boy in 1986, the film was later re- titled to Something Special for a 1987 limited theatrical release and for a VHS release. Synopsis Milly Niceman is a fourteen-year-old girl who has grown frustrated with her mother's attempts to curtail her tomboyish nature. Her mother, Doris, believes that Milly's actions are inappropriate for a girl, and that she'd be better off showing more interest in dances and dresses. When her best friend's younger brother, Malcolm, sells her a spell that will grant her deepest wish, that will only work during the upcoming eclipse, Milly jumps at the chance. She performs the spell, and believes that it has failed. The next morning, Milly discovers that not only was the spell successful, but it turned her into a boy. She tells her family about what happened, and to her surprise, her father encourages her to explore her new masculinity. As a result, Milly changes her name to \\"Willy\\", and begins attending a new school as a transfer student. Milly initially takes well to her new persona and gender, but eventually becomes conflicted when she begins to realize that life isn't necessarily easier as a boy and that she has feelings for her friend Alfie, who is equally confused about his feelings for \\"Willy\\". By the film's end, Milly decides to become female once more. Malcolm sells Milly a wishing stone that she is to throw at her favorite star at 12:03 during a star shower. She turns back into a girl again.

He is wearing a woollen robe and felt boots. Gyalo Thondup (; ), born c.1927, is the second-eldest brother of the 14th Dalai Lama. He often acted as the Dalai Lama's unofficial envoy.  Early life In late fall of 1927, Gyalo Thondup was born in the village of Taktser, Amdo (Ping'an District, Qinghai province). In 1939, he moved with his family to Lhasa. In 1942, at the age of 14, Thondup went to Nanjing, the capital of Republican China, to study Standard Chinese and the history of China. He often visited Chiang Kai-shek at his home and ate dinner with him. \\"In fact, young Gyalo Thondup ate his meals at the Chiang family table, from April 1947 until the summer of 1949, and tutors selected by Chiang educated the boy.\\" In 1948, he married Zhu Dan, the daughter of a Kuomintang general. Political involvement In 1949, before the Communist revolution of that year in China, Thondup left Nanjing for India via British Hong Kong. \\"Gyalo Thondup... was the first officially acknowledged Tibetan to visit Taiwan since 1949. Taipei Radio announced the meeting between President Chang Kai-shek on 21 May 1950.\\" Fluent in Chinese, Tibetan and English, he \\"later facilitated semi-official contacts between the Tibetan-government-in- exile and the Republic of China (ROC) as well as with the People's Republic of China (PRC) government in 1979.\\" United States activities In 1951, he traveled to America and became the main source of information on Tibet for the United States Department of State. America's Central Intelligence Agency promised to make Tibet independent from China in exchange for Thondup's support in organizing guerrilla units to fight against the People's Liberation Army, an offer which Thondup accepted.On the CIA's links to the Dalai Lama and his family and entourage, see Loren Coleman, Tom Slick and the Search for the Yeti (London: Faber and Faber, 1989). Thondup maintains that he did not inform the 14th Dalai Lama about the CIA's actions, and this support ended after the 1972 Nixon visit to China. Later career With the permission of the Dalai Lama, Thondup met Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping in 1979 for open political talks, which Thondup terminated in 1993, feeling them to be useless. In the 1990s, Thondup made several official visits to China, acting as the Dalai Lama's unofficial envoy. In recent years, Thondup has repeatedly stated that dialogue is the only way to achieve progress with China. In 1998, the Central Tibetan Administration (the political arm of the Dalai Lama's anti-China diaspora faction) criticized Thondup for not letting the Dalai Lama know about the CIA's involvement in Tibet. Over a decade later, Thondup accused his sister-in-law's father of embezzling money from the Central Tibetan Administration.  See also  * Thubten Norbu  Publications  * (with Anne F.

This film tells the story of the life of the late Sukarno, the first president of Indonesia. Sukarno, who was born with the name \\"Kusno\\", was one of the major figures who played an important part in the fight for Indonesia's independence from Dutch colonial rule. This film stars Ario Bayu as Sukarno. On 13 December 2013, the Central Jakarta Business Management Court (PTUN) acceded to a request made by one of Sukarno's daughters, Rachmawati Soekarnoputri, to halt the film's release. Some film critics had criticised the film for being too commercialised and taking liberties in its depiction of historical events and characters. Subsequently however, on 7 January 2014, the PTUN decided to overturn its earlier decision and allow the film to be shown. The film was selected as Indonesia's entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 87th Academy Awards, but was not nominated. Plot Soekarno is based on the life of Sukarno which covers the period from his childhood until his historical Proclamation of Indonesian Independence. In 1931, the Dutch East Indies government in Java Island captures Sukarno, an aspiring young nationalist who wants to free Indonesia from Dutch colonial rule. He is then placed in Banceuy Prison at Bandung, Indonesia. Sukarno finds a way to fight back by delivering his famous defense oration \\"Indonesia Accuses!\\" (Indonesia Menggugat) in his trial at Bandung Laandraad Courthouse.

She wanted actor Anjasmara to play Sukarno in the film, but the director, Hanung Bramantyo, stuck to his choice of Ario Bayu. However, Rachmawati felt that Ario did not meet her expectations in his portrayal of her father. She had also complained that she was not permitted to give directions or provide feedback on Ario's presentation and interpretation of the gestures and mannerisms of the lead character, something she felt was necessary for him to better portray her father. On 23 September 2013, the dispute came to a head with Rachmawati reporting Hanung Bramantyo to the police on allegations of defamation. At the same time, Hanung had publicly stated that he believed Rachmawati's motive for the public dispute with him was purely to seek publicity and popularity for herself. The movie's release went ahead despite the dispute. On his part, the director believed that the movie was historically accurate. \\"I will continue to screen Sokarno because there is nothing wrong with the movie,\\" he said in September 2013. He said that Rachmawati only had the right to give her advice but not to make any actual decisions concerning the film itself. He also said that matters concerning the making of a film was the sole prerogative of the director.

Wilson was born at Renton, two miles from Dumbarton, Scotland. He emigrated to Australia in October 1852, in the ship Sir William Molesworth‚Äîa joint stock concern‚Äîall the passengers having an interest in her. The captain and crew went out on 1s. per month wages, in order to get their discharge on landing. Shortly after his arrival, in 1853, Mr. Wilson commenced business in the timber trade at Geelong as a member of the firm of Tate, Wilson & Wright. After they had straggled through the commercial crisis of 1854, the partnership was dissolved, whereupon Mr. Wilson went into the New Zealand trade, bringing oats, etc., to the Fiery Creek rush. He afterwards bought a business there, and on the opening of the Canton lead at Ararat, Victoria, opened a wholesale store there. Three years later he sold his business, and turned his attention, with a fair measure of success, to pastoral pursuits, first on the Lower Goulburn and then in the Lower Wimmera. He then joined the firm of Boyd, McNaught & Boyd, which was subsequently known as Wilson, Crosbie & Co. Wilson had been one of the earliest town councillors of Ararat; and in February 1866 was returned to the Legislative Assembly for the Ararat district. Wilson was Commissioner of Railways in the James McCulloch Government from 2 to 20 September 1869, and again under the same Premier from 9 April 1870, to 19 June 1871. At the following election he was defeated by Michael Carroll, but was soon afterwards returned to the Legislative Council as a representative of the Eastern Province. He afterwards retired and paid a somewhat lengthened visit to Europe. He re-entered the political arena for a short time in 1881, when he opposed the re-election of David Gaunson, at Ararat, on his appointment as Commissioner of Crown Lands, and succeeded in defeating him by a considerable majority. He did not, however, again offer himself at the general election in 1883. Mr. Wilson was in England from 1885 to 1886, when he returned to the colony. In 1873 he became a director of the National Bank of Australasia, and was chairman of the board in 1876. Mr. Wilson was largely interested in pastoral pursuits in Victoria and New South Wales, and was also chairman of the Evening Standard Newspaper Company of Melbourne. He died on 16 November 1891.

She began to read voraciously, debate social issues, and build a personal national consciousness. Lee taught high school for two years before making her literary debut. She often travels to remote and underdeveloped parts of the world, and served as a volunteer worker in Indonesia for two years. Work Lee is still considered an author in the new generation of women writers, whose careers are still evolving. Lee believes that she cannot write a single sentence about something she has not personally experienced and felt in the deepest core of her being. Her dependency on real experiences, which explains the small volume of her literary output, may be seen as an indication of a master craftsman or an amateurish approach towards writing; regardless of how she is viewed, however, Lee writes with utmost care and polish. Thematically, Lee‚Äôs works center on families in different stages of disintegration. Although she is a feminist writer deeply interested in women‚Äôs place in family and in society, Lee also departs significantly from the stereotypical feminist perspective of gender dichotomy.

She survives today as the yacht Marala. Background With a shortage of warships at the start of the war, and the Battle of the Atlantic, the Royal Navy found itself in particular need of escort vessels to protect merchant shipping from commerce-raiding German U-Boats and surface raiders. Production of new vessels was increased in Britain and abroad, obsolete United States Navy destroyers would be obtained under the Destroyers for Bases Agreement, and all manner of civil vessels would be adapted as naval vessels. This included fishing trawlers utilised as minesweepers, passenger liners such as and , both converted to armed merchant cruisers, and sundry other vessels. The Evadne was a large motor yacht belonging to Richard Fairey, of Fairey Aviation, which built the Fleet Air Arm's Swordfish torpedo bomber, among other designs. Transferred to the Admiralty for the duration of hostilities, she was refitted in England as an anti-submarine vessel. Service history= Irish Sea  Before full conversion for anti-submarine warfare in early 1940, Evadne was only lightly armed, with depth charges dropped by hand. Based in Liverpool, during this time she carried out patrols and other duties in the Irish Sea. After conversion at the Grayson Rollo shipyard, and a few weeks providing an examination service at Holyhead, she escorted convoys in the Irish Sea, from bases at Holyhead, Milford Haven and Liverpool.  Bermuda  In July 1942 Evadne joined the escort group to escort a convoy across the Atlantic before breaking away to Bermuda, where she remained on anti-submarine duties at the Royal Naval Dockyard.Yankee R.N., by Commander Alex H. Cherry, OBE, RNVR. Jarrold's Publishers (London) Ltd, Portland Street, London W1 The dockyard was the core of a naval base in Bermuda that included the North America and West Indies Squadron, an Admiralty House, and a Royal Naval Air Station. It had been placed in Bermuda following the American War of Independence as its location (about 1,030 kilometres (640 mi) off of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, 1,239 kilometres (770 mi) south of Cape Sable Island, Nova Scotia, and 1,770 kilometres (1,100 mi) northeast of Miami, Florida) made it a useful replacement for the continental bases lost with American independence. During both world wars, in addition to its other roles, Bermuda served as a forming- up point for trans-Atlantic convoys. Ships arrived singly, and collected into convoys within the safety of Bermuda's surrounding barrier reef. During the Second World War, the convoys from Bermuda, (coded BHX) joined at sea with convoys originating at Halifax, Nova Scotia (coded HX), before crossing the Atlantic, it having been shown mathematically that - the area of a circle increasing disproportionately to its circumference as its radius is increased - it required relatively fewer warships to protect one large convoy than two smaller ones. Although the convoys were provided with a Royal Naval escort, shortages of escort vessels early in the war meant this might be only a single warship, as with Convoy HX 84 (which included ships from Bermuda), escorted only by the Bermuda-based armed passenger liner HMS Jervis Bay, which was attacked by the Admiral Scheer in November, 1940. Vessels arriving alone at Bermuda generally had no protection until they neared the archipelago where HMS Evadne patrolled the surrounding Atlantic, and also met and escorted arriving vessels to the channel through the reefs, where they were met by the converted tugboat, , crewed by local-service ratings, which brought the pilot (who steered the visiting ship through the reefs) and the naval examination officer tasked with inspecting arriving vessels. The Castle Harbour also carried out anti-submarine patrols within the reef (although the likelihood of anyone unfamiliar with the local waters navigating through the reef in a vessel of any size was unlikely, the events at Scapa Flow, on 14 October 1939, illustrated the dangers of complacency). By 1943, the Battle of the Atlantic had been largely won by the Allies. Unites States forces had built two airbases in Bermuda and established a military garrison on Bermuda that dwarfed the British one, providing numerous coastal and anti-aircraft batteries and infantry and other military units. The British Government had placed a moratorium on the local Territorial Army units (the Bermuda Militia Artillery, Bermuda Militia Infantry, Bermuda Volunteer Engineers, and Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps) preventing them from sending contingents for service overseas after the June, 1940, contingent of the Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps to the Lincolnshire Regiment (with Bermuda Militia Artillery and Bermuda Volunteer Engineers personnel accompanying it and separating in England to join their parent corps, the Royal Artillery and Royal Engineers). The senior United States officer in Bermuda was made superior to the British, and the Royal Navy's local Commander-in-Chief was reduced in status as control of the western Atlantic was ceded by Britain to the United States Navy. With the reduced threat from the German Kriegsmarine and the build-up of United States forces in Bermuda, British forces began to be re-deployed elsewhere. The moratorium on the local territorials was lifted and the Bermuda Militia Artillery and Bermuda Militia Infantry jointly formed a detached company- strength contingent to serve in Europe, while the Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps did the same. The two contingents trained together at Prospect Camp before the Bermuda Militia contingent left to form the training cadre of the new Caribbean Regiment, which served in Italy, Egypt and Palestine, and the Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps contingent joined the Lincolnshire Regiment for service in North-West Europe. The Royal Naval forces were also reduced. HMS Castle Harbour was ordered to the Mediterranean in 1942, but never reached it, being torpedoed by a German submarine on 16 October.  Gibraltar  Although the United States Navy's USS Dynamic was assigned to patrolling the waters of Bermuda at the end of 1942, Evadne remained in Bermuda until also reallocated to the Commander-in-Chief Mediterranean, arriving on 12 March 1944 in Gibraltar, where she was based until hostilities ended. On 19 February 1945, she badly damaged German U-boat U-300 with depth charges in the Strait of Gibraltar, in position . The U-boat was subsequently sunk on 22 February in the North Atlantic west of Cadiz, in position , by gunfire from the British minesweepers and . Nine of the 50 crew were lost. Yacht Marala in Venice in 2012 Evadne arrived back in Portsmouth on 6 September 1945 and was paid off the following month. Current role Following the war, Evadne returned to civil life as a yacht. She operates today in the Mediterranean, under the name MY Marala, still with her original engines. In print Captain Harold Taylor of the Royal Naval Reserve was first mate on Evadne when war broke out and continued to serve on her as First Lieutenant and later commanding officer. He wrote about his experiences in his book A Captain‚Äôs Tale. Commander Alex Cherry of the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve, an American volunteer, had joined the Evadne prior to the crossing to Bermuda, and served aboard her there before being transferred to other vessels. He recorded his time aboard her in his book, Yankee R.N. On film The Evadne (now Marala) was the setting of the 2001 film The Cat's Meow, in which she represented William Randolph Hearst's yacht, the Oneida.

Only one was constructed. Development The single example of the E.T.186 training glider was built to Enzo Tadeschi's design by seven students of the Modena Aeronautical Association. It was a simple, wood framed aircraft, covered with a mixture of plywood and fabric. Its high single spar wing was mounted over the fuselage on a pedestal and braced to the lower fuselage with a single faired metal strut on each side. The wing was unswept and had constant chord, ending in rounded tips. Ailerons occupied about half the span and the outer wing had 2¬∞ of washout to delay the stall over them. The E.T.186 had a deep sided hexagonal fuselage covered in plywood forwards and fabric aft. Its cockpit was just ahead of the wing leading edge, placing the pilot's head against the front of the central pedestal; the glider could be flown with an open cockpit or alternatively from under a perspex canopy. The fuselage tapered rearwards, where a tapered, round tipped tailplane mounted on top of the fuselage carried separate balanced elevators. A small fin placed over the elevators mounted a full, balanced, rounded rudder; all the tail control surfaces were fabric covered. The main undercarriage of the E.T.186 was a combination of a short, sprung skid reaching from the nose to the wing strut attachment point and a fixed monowheel immediately aft, at about mid-chord. The underside of the rudder was protected by a rounded tail bumper. The E.T.186 was first flown on 21 October 1947. It was tow-launched behind a jeep at the airfield of the Aero Club of Reggio Emilia.

When young, he was inspired by his father, a professor of Korean Language and Literature at Kyungpook National University, to become a novelist one day. During his high school years, Yi won awards for various national creative writing competitions. However, after entering college, he changed his career path to become a literary critic. There, he made his debut in 1988 with a critical essay called ‚ÄúStudy of Yang Guija‚Äù (Yang Guija ron) which was published in Literature and Society, a Korean quarterly literary magazine. After this, he was editor for a couple of literary magazines. Several years later, he published his first novel, Who Is It That Can Tell Me Who I Am (1992), ultimately becoming a novelist. His pen name, Yi In-hwa, is a character from Korean classical novel writer Yom Sang-seop's work, Before the Cries of 'Manse' (1922). Career Yi first started his career in 1995 as Korean Literature Professor at Ewha Womans University in central Seoul before getting his Ph.D. After spending 10 years in the department of Korean Literature, he changed his concentration to digital storytelling, becoming professor of Division of Digital Media at Ewha Womans University. Yi was attracted to the field of digital storytelling in that he started to get addicted to MMORPG. He frequently stated that he was a huge fan of MMORPG Lineage.KBS TV show , (26-Jan-2013) He applied his creative writing theories to digital storytelling mainly targeted to games. He is considered to be a pioneer in the Korean digital storytelling field. In 2016, Yi became embroiled in the Choi Soon-sil scandal when it was alleged that Yi helped Choi Soon-sil's daughter pass a class she never attended, including having his assistants take a final exam for her. He was arrested on January 3. Work As can be deduced from its title which is taken from Hamlet, Who Can Tell Me Who I Am (1992) depicts the madness of 1980s Korea and questions whether anyone was able to find his true self in that era. Yi's critical attitude toward the 80s may be a necessary step before ushering in 1990s literature, but it has often been criticized for its one-dimensional belittlement of a painful era in Korean modern history. Yi was an unusual author for the era in that he was a supporter of the Park Chung-hee regime and in his novel The Path of Human(1997-1998) presented Park as an unequivocal hero, a stance that quickly caught the attention of the press. As a member of the so-called 3-8-6 Generation in Korea, Park would have been expected to be anti-dictator and pro-democracy, but he was not. The book sparked huge controversy among Korean intellectuals, making Yi one of the ultra- conservative novelists. Recently, he is depicted as a rather progressive figure because of his ardent opposition to Korean ruling Saenuri Party's online game regulation act. Everlasting Empire (1993), modeled after Umberto Eco‚Äôs The Name of the Rose, borrows elements of a detective novel in tracing the mystery surrounding the death of Prince Sado and his son King Jeongjo. An entertaining novel with potential for mass appeal, Everlasting Empire was also embroiled in much controversy due to the author's over-interpretation of history and the conservative statements he made. Yi's works, in general, shows a strong political leaning: at times, it is as though the author borrows the pages of his own novel to express his political views and promote the awareness of certain socio-political and historical issues. This book is one of Yi's notable works, being million seller nationwide. His latest fiction, Inferno 9 (2012), was originally developed for the online game under the same name. The book is about intellectually intensified humans going inside a dream world to solve a mystery. The relationship between the real world and dream world is thoroughly described in the story, combined with his fantastic creativity inspired from games.

Biography Linnerhielm studied at the University of Lund and graduated in 1776. He pursued a career as a civil servant, holding different offices between 1776 and 1796. During this time he was taught drawing, and came under the influence of Elias Martin and his brother Johan Fredrik Martin. In 1795 his wife, Helena Maria Ehrenstr√•hle, published a short collection of poems to which Linnerhielm made illustrations. The illustrations are in the style of Salomon Gessner. It has been described as one of the best examples of Swedish book art during the 18th century. In 1794, he inherited his father's manorial estate, Ebbetorp manor, in Sm√•land. Two years later he resigned from his official duties to concentrate his efforts on the running of the estate. In 1799-1800 he renovated the main house and created an English landscape garden on the grounds. Between 1797 and 1809 he published three volumes of travel accounts from Sweden, illustrated by himself (Bref under resor i Sverige (1797), Bref under nya resor i Sverige (1806) and Bref under senare resor i Sverige (1816)). These books are considered to be the first examples of purely recreational travel writing in Swedish. Linnerhielm has been called \\"the first Swedish tourist\\".

He is recognized as a major poet of the 1980s, with more than thirty books to his credit. Biography Mozid Mahmud is the pen name of Mohammad Abdul Mozid. He was born in 1966 at Chargorgori, a village thirteen km west of Pabna in East Pakistan, to the family of Mohammad Keramat Ali Biswas and Sanowara Begum. Education He completed his early education in the local school and college. In 1986, he crossed the Jamuna and went to capital Dhaka, where he attended the University of Dhaka to receive an MA degree in Bengali literature and language in 1989 with a First Class. He was awarded a research grant by the Nazrul Institute in 1996, the result of which was Nazrul: Spokesman of the Third World (Nazrul: Tritiya Bishwer Mukhopatro; 1997) published from the same institute. He also awarded a research fellow by the University Grand commission, the result of which was Travelodge of Tagore (Rabindranather Vraman Sahitya 2010). Career A journalist by profession, he carefully escapes the arena of popular and prosaic day-to-day information that the job deserves, and dives into the invincible deep of poetic inspiration from where he collects pebbles of pictures, aroma of feelings and intense fabric of thought, after which an automatic mental process of jeopardizing them continues in its own accord. He taught Bengali literature at some colleges and universities for almost five years. Activism Mozid Mahmud has been working with poor and vulnerable people in Bangladesh, especially destitute northern part of the country from two decades. He established Organization for Social Advancement & Cultural Activities (OSACA) a non-government organisation which is fighting for hunger and legal rights.

The system was introduced under the Labour administration in 2009/10 when it was called \\"Any Willing Provider\\" - The policy continued and was accelerated under the newly formed coalition Government and changed its name in 2011 to become \\"Any Qualified Provider.\\" Its implementation was achieved through the NHS operating framework and a strong central team based in the Department of Health that supported and oversaw local implementation. It did not require any statutory instrument to achieve its aims and was often incorrectly considered to be part of the reforms associated with the Health and Social Care Act 2012. NHS Hearing Aids and eye tests June 2013 Originally the terminology used was \\"Any Willing Provider\\". The change to \\"Any Qualified Provider\\" was largely cosmetic: there were no substantial changes in the regime from that introduced by Andy Burnham, Secretary of State for Health in 2009/10.  Services  A range of 39 services were specified as suitable for the AQP regime in September 2012: Development Originally each primary care trust (PCT) was required to introduce at least three AQP services, but by April 2013 the grip of the programme loosened with reduction in central oversight, and the regime become more permissive. A survey by the Health Service Journal in August 2014 found that clinical commissioning groups enthusiasm for using 'any qualified provider' to increase competition and extend patient choice had declined. Of 183 groups surveys, 77 did not open any new AQP services in 2013/4, and 109 had no plans to introduce any. Those that had introduced new services mostly concentrated on audiology, non-obstetric ultrasound, podiatry, MRI, eye care, and back and neck pain services. Nottingham City Clinical Commissioning Group is bringing in a wider range of providers for phlebotomy services and a treatment room service for minor injuries and wound treatment which offers GPs an alternative to local walk-in centres or acute emergency departments. Great Yarmouth and Waveney CCG is bringing in new neurological rehabilitation service providers using AQP. By 2015 it was clear that enthusiasm for this approach at national level had faded, and there was only patchy use of it at a local level. There were no requirements for commissioners to use AQP for services after April 2013 and 77 of the 183 CCGs did not open any services to AQP in 2013/14. The AQP Regime * Commissioners - generally groups of clinical commissioning groups establish specifications against which potential providers are assessed. This ensures that there is absolute clarity on what services are required. AQP can only work if what is delivered is a standard service. * Providers are then accredited principally on their ability to meet a range of quality standards, rather than cost. Providers are assessed on their ability to meet established quality standards via external accreditation e.g. by the Care Quality Commission. * Providers undertake to continue to meet a range of established criteria and standards, thus ensuring that high standards of service are maintained. * Patients and their referring clinicians can decide upon which provider they wish to use. This facilitates patient choice and empowerment. This regime is somewhat similar to that which has prevailed in NHS dentistry, pharmacy and optometry since 1948: patients can use any provider they wish. Guidance was provided by the Department of Health Team, travelling around the UK working with regional teams. An example can be found here According to Private Eye magazine no providers had actually been accredited by December 2014, because Monitor only licenses organisations that hold NHS contracts worth more than ¬£10 million a year. None of these contracts approach that figure in respect of the CCG contracts which have been let.

Its history (and that of its occupants) shows Virginia's changing racial relations: from 19th century occupation by privileged whites ranging from slaveowners to proponents of Jim Crow, to 20th century occupation by economically successful and politically active African Americans. and Accompanying photo History A wealthy family or group of investors built Blandome circa 1830. The builder's identity is uncertain because real estate records only became organized for this area of the city (which became known as \\"Diamond Hill\\") circa 1872, when Laura H. Tucker, wife of John Randolph Tucker, bought the property for $6500 from Jacob Fuller (1816-1890), a native Lexingtonian who was the librarian of the Virginia Military Institute (hence \\"VMI\\").NRIS Section 8, p. 8 describes the tax and real estate records for the property before that date as \\"contradictory and incomplete.\\" Beginnings through the American Civil War That institution's chief catalyst, John Thomas Lewis Preston (1811-1890), lived at Blandome when his first wife, the former Sarah Lyle Caruthers (1811-1856), gave birth to their son Thomas Lewis Preston on June 2, 1835. Young Thomas L. Preston was named after his paternal grandfather Major Thomas L. Preston (1781-1812) who had represented Rockbridge County in the Virginia House of Delegates for several years. In 1844 J.T.L. Preston moved his family to a house at 110 Preston Street. The educator, lawyer and military officer had graduated from Lexington's Washington College (now Washington and Lee University, hence \\"W&L;\\") in 1828 and during the next decade helped found VMI, located in what had been a former state arsenal building. VMI accepted its first students in 1839, and J.T.L. Preston was one of its first professors as well as spokesman. After Lt.Col. J.T.L. Preston's service in the Confederate States Army (including under fellow faculty member promoted to Gen. Stonewall Jackson, who died in 1863) and emancipation of his plantations' slaves (he owned property in several counties as well as Kentucky, and the non-slave states of Illinois and Indiana) caused financial troubles, Preston returned to teach at VMI. In 1870 he transferred some Lexington property (possibly Blandome) to Jacob Fuller. Before the war, J.T.L. Preston had invested jointly in several ventures with other Lexington natives and/or faculty members. He and Jacob Fuller (or his father of the same name), were among investors in a tannery at the foot of Diamond Hill; another investor was VMI professor Stonewall Jackson. Preston could have rented or rented out the house in which his son was born. His wife's elder brother, novelist Dr. William A. Caruthers (1802-1846) could also have owned or lived in the house (before financial reverses circa 1829, or during his return to the city in 1835), since he or especially his father William Caruthers (1771-1817) owned many properties in Lexington.NRIS Section 8, pp. 9-10 The Fullers appear to have lived in Blandome in the 1850s, and by 1850 operated a classical college preparatory school in Lexington, although contemporary advertisements contain no address.NRIS Section 8, pp. 9-11 Jacob Fuller owned slaves.The 1830 federal census for Lexington, Rockbridge County, Virginia shows Jacob Fuller owning 4 slaves; the 1860 U.S. Federal Census slave schedule showed Fuller as owning male slaves aged 33 and 35, and female slaves aged 21 and 1. However, Virginia slave censuses are not available online at ancestry.com. During the American Civil War, Union General Hunter raided Lexington, and later Union General George Crook made his headquarters at the Fullers' residence. Fuller sold other houses on that street in 1873, and built a smaller house for himself and his wife below Blandome as the hill developed. John Randolph Tucker and his family John Randolph and Laura Tucker acquired Blandome, gave it its name, as well as renovated it as the surrounding area developed. Although sometimes given the honorific \\"Judge,\\" Tucker, was like Preston a lawyer and Virginia's Attorney General during the American Civil War and active in support of the Confederate cause. Immediately after the war, he practiced in Loudoun County as well as defended Confederate President Jefferson Davis, taught law at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, and in 1869 became counsel for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. Former Confederate General Robert E. Lee invited Tucker to teach at Washington College in 1870 (which was renamed to include the Confederate General's name in 1871). The Tuckers lived at Blandome from 1872 to 1875, as Tucker continued teaching and became the first dean of the new Washington and Lee University Law School. Tucker resigned from W&L; to represent Virginia's 6th congressional district (the northern Shenandoah Valley and his native Winchester, Virginia) in the U.S. House of Representatives. He delivered an annual lecture series at W&L;, and also maintained a home and legal practice in Washington, D.C. during that decade. In 1889, after declining to seek re- election to Congress, Tucker returned to the W&L; Law School as Professor of Equity, Commercial, Constitutional and International Law (and also helped confer an honorary degree upon Col. Preston in 1881, shortly before his retirement from VMI). Tucker also continued his private legal practice (building a surviving outbuilding for use as his law office) and even served as President of the American Bar Association before his death in 1897. His son Harry Tucker continued his father's association with the W&L; Law School, and in 1904 Laura Tucker sold Blandome.NRIS pp. 11-13 20th century Walker and Wood families After several intervening owners (and a year after Laura Tucker's death), African American business leader Harry Lee Walker (1875-1941) acquired Blandome.http://rrrockbridge.org/harry-lee-eliza- walkerhttp://www.historiclexington.org/assets/african-walking-tour-brochure- low-res.pdf Born in a cabin at the foot of the hill and with an initial trade as a butcher, Walker built a thriving business purveying meat to VMI, W&L;, and various fraternities, and later expanded into seafood and groceries and also increased his wealth through real estate investments.NRIS pp. 14-15 With his wife Eliza Bannister Walker (1874-1939; formerly a nurse at Washington D.C.'s Freedman's hospital as well as a professional singer), Walker was active in the First Baptist Church and supported his wife's numerous social and educational causes, particularly as they affected blacks, women and children. Their only son Harry Thomas (1897-1914) died young; their daughter Nannie Elizabeth (1900-1993) would marry Clarence M. Wood Sr. (1899-1957) who would become his father-in-law's business partner and successor. Eliza Walker helped found the Virginia Federation of Colored Women and held their 1921 conference at Blandome. One of Walker's tenants, VMI professor, Robert T. Kerlin, also championed African American causes.NRIS pp. 14-16 Clarence M. Wood Sr. continued his father-in-law's business and helped his wife raise six children at Blandome. Originally from Middlesex County, Wood graduated from Virginia Union University and came to edit the Lexington Star, as well as sold real estate with his brother Joseph Wood and insurance for the North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Society. He also taught night school in Lexington during the 1930s and in the 1940s became administrator of the newly opened (and segregated) Green Pastures Recreation Area (now Longdale Recreation Area) in nearby Alleghany County.https://www.virginia.org/listings/OutdoorsAndSports/LongdaleRecreation/ Wood also owned a car dealership, gas station and drive-in ice cream parlor by the time he died in 1957. His wife Nannie managed the various family businesses after his death and until her own death in 1993. One of their sons, Alexander B. Wood, took up residence at Blandome with his wife, Freddye H.

The school was built in 1905 by the Society of Jesus in order to replace the previous school that had become too small. It is situated next to the Jesuit administered Saint John Berchmans Church. History The current St Michael's College is chronologically the third college to be built:  The first college  The Jesuits have been in Brussels since 1586. By the request of Albert VII, Archduke of Austria (1559-1621) and Isabella Clara Eugenia (1566-1633) the Jesuits agreed to open a college. Inaugurated on July 14, 1604, the college is composed of a large rectangle formed by the Rue de la Paille (Straw Road), the Rue de Ruysbroeck (Ruysbroeck Road) and the Rue d'Or (Golden Road). The Jesuits were ejected from the school in 1773 and it was demolished in 1891.  The second college In 1814, the Jesuits returned to Belgium and opened the French-speaking St Michael's College 19 years later in the Chapel Church area of the city. In 1905, the expanding population forced the Jesuits to not only expand the college but to also look for a location for a new college. In 1905, the college on Ursuline Street (Dutch: Ursulinenstraat) was renamed as St John Berchmans College and the new college in the Etterbeek part of the city became St Michael's College.Info from St Michel College retrieved 20 February 2014  The third college In 1905, building on the new St Michael's college was complete and work on the nearby church started. It was built in the same architectural style as the rest of the school buildings. On 20 July 1908, the foundation stone of the church was laid by the Papal nuncio to Belgium, Msg. Giovanni Tacci Porcelli. The architect was Joseph Pr√©mont who was inspired by the Rhenan Romanesque tradition of the Middle Ages. It was consecrated on 9 July 1912 by the Bishop of Galle, Joseph van Reeth SJ. Starting in the late 1930s, a shift in language was made which would result in St John Berchmans College speaking Dutch and English and the French-speaking section of the college being transferred to St Michael's College.Cegesoma.be retrieved 20 February 2014  Known Figures  Notable former students the old St Michael's College: * Ferdinand Perier (1875-1968), former professor at the college, Archbishop of Calcutta (1924-1960) * Hubert Pierlot (1883-1963), Prime Minister of Belgium (1939-1945) Notable former students of the new St Michael's College: * Georges Lema√Ætre, (1894-1966), physicist and astronomer, considered the founder of the Big Bang theory * Andr√© Waterkeyn, (1917-2005), engineer, creator of the Atomium * Archduke Rudolf of Austria (1919‚Äì2010). * Jacques van Ypersele de Strihou (1936- ) Chief of Staff of Kings Baudouin and Albert II * Fran√ßois Weyergans, (1941-), writer and academician * Charles Picqu√©, (1948- ), politician * Olivier Maingain, (1958-), member of the House of Representatives and Mayor of Woluwe-St-Lambert * Philippe of Belgium (1960-) * Prince Laurent of Belgium (1963-) * Olivier Minne, (1967), television host, producer and actor Gallery Image:√âglise des j√©suites - Bruxelles.JPGThe Jesuit church of 1664 situated next to its original site Image:College st Michel rue Ursulines cote rue.jpgThe second college's frontage on Rue des Ursulines (Ursulines Road) Image:Coll√®ge St Michel 1900.jpgThe new school around 1905 without St John Berchmans Church See also * Saint John Berchmans Church, Brussels * St John Berchmans College, Brussels * Society of Jesus ReferencesExternal links * St Michael College site Category:Etterbeek Category:Secondary schools in Brussels Michael Category:Educational institutions established in 1905 Category:1905 establishments in Belgium ","title":"St Michael College, Brussels"},{"id":"40962195","text":"The Brogberg is a hill, 567 metres high, in the Palatine Forest in Germany.

He set out to create and sell custom-made gold ornaments and defined that as the business‚Äô core objective. His passion for his trade skill earned him a highly respectable name in the market and among its elites i.e. Tamil Nadu and Kerala. The jewels he created became famous for their quality, because of the temple goldsmith's he had and the great demand for his jewels led to the opening of the first retail showroom in Palliyadi and Nagercoil. The showroom‚Äôs customer base kept growing even after his time in his native place of Palliyadi. The Nagercoil showroom was created to deliver a great shopping ambience to customers as well as to showcase the brand‚Äôs extremely wide range of designs with respect to the Indian market demand. After his success in his native soil he started exporting gold ornaments to Temples and Indian cities like Madras, Bombay and even as far as to British-Colonial Burma.

Today it is still a large town. From southeast to northwest, the city is split by the river the Dommel. Etymology The following story is based on a popular belief (saga) According to legend, Sint-Oedenrode owes its name to Saint Oda. The saga goes as follows: This woman was a mythical blind born Scottish, possibly Irish, daughter of king Eugenius VII, who around the year 700, along with a servant was sent on a pilgrimage on the mainland by her father. Oda was miracilously cured from her blindness after she visited the tomb of Saint Lambert of Maastricht in Li√®ge. She decided she wanted to devote her life to the Christian god and become a nun. She returned to her father who had decided a husband for her. Oda did not wish to marry as was her father's wish. In a desperate attempt of not marrying, she decided to flee to the mainland. She started to travel from one place to another, wherever she could find silence for worshipping. Time on time she was disrupted in her worshipping by magpies, and she fled from the birds. Eventually she arrived in Toxandria (Austrasia) in a little settlement called Rode (old Dutch word for a man made open place in the woods), where the villagers built her a hut on the heath and she settled as a hermit. After she died in 726 A.D. the villagers were getting pilgrims from the entire region, and started to call the place Sint- Oda's-Rode, which became Sint-Oedenrode in present-day speaking.

Jaargang XXVII Prehistory and Roman times The first traces of human presence date from the period between 10,000 and 9,000 BC. The first settlements whose remains were found during the excavation of the Dommel riverbank near the Hazenputten in the Vresselse Bossen, (Nijnsel), date from a period between 9000 and 8000 BC. In the Bronze Age the first farmers settled in and around Sint-Oedenrode. About the following era is not much known. First records of the settlement called Rhode date from 500. Sint-Oedenrode was a small settlement on an elevated place near the river Dommel. The settlements on both riverbanks (Rhode and Eerschot) merged into one larger settlement. In the 11th century the Lords of Rhode built a castle on the elevated area (during excavations in 2005 remains of the castle were uncovered, proving the early records to be valid). The Eerschot part of the settlement constructed the first church (the church has been rebuilt many times over the centuries; the early base can still be seen in the church which is nowadays named Knoptoren which means Bud Tower). The settlement thrived and became an important place in the region. Sint-Oedenrode was granted city status in 1232 by the Duke of Brabant (at that time Hendrik I of Brabant). This promoted Sint-Oedenrode to the capital of Peelland (the name of the region in North Brabant). thumbA map of the excavation of a settlement from the early Bronze Age, around 1500 BC in Nijnsel, in the municipality Sint-Oedenrode. The main building within the excavated portion is a farm of 17 meters by 6 meters. The outer wall consisted of poles that were connected with braid and were covered with clay. The posts within the farm will have borne the roof. A series of heavy poles on the south side of the farm probably supported a far extended roof on that side that was necessary in view of the down pouring rain that could wash away the clay there. In the long walls of the farmhouse opposite to each other there are two wide entrances forming a corridor which divided the building into a living area and a shed or barn. Around the farm there were numerous outbuildings. The most notable was a circular building that was probably a sheepfold. The other buildings are square or rectangular sheds and called \\"Spiekers\\": constructions of four or six poles with a raised floor for the storage of grain and hay. Northwest of the main building was a large barn of 7 by 3.5 meters. The many other posts will have served a variety of small buildings that belong to a farm like racks, an apiary, doghouse etc. The dark spots on the map were pits which were probably used for manure or the storing of winter silage. County Rode The first reclamation took place in the early Middle Ages on fertile woodland along the Dommel. The oldest core and the original parish of Sint-Oedenrode is located in Eerschot, now part of Sint-Oedenrode. In this place were the Lords of Rode established before they moved further along the Dommel, where they built their castle \\"Rode\\". In the earliest period in the early Middle Ages, Sint-Oedenrode formed the core of the county Rode. There is no exact size of this county known, but following the Roois customary law, which applied to the corresponding places, there can still an estimation be made of the size of the county. The customary law of Rode was imposed for the so-called associates of Rode. This included Sint- Oedenrode, Liempde, Son en Breugel, Veghel, Erp, Schijndel, Stiphout, Lieshout, Aarle-Beek, Bakel, Deurne, Lierop, Tongelre, Nuenen, Gerwen and Nederwetten. They were able to appeal at the so-called main court in Sint- Oedenrode. During this period, the inhabitants of these villages were therefore designated by the name Rodenaren and received their land rights by Roois law. The Roois law was in 1547 for the first time been put in writing. But part of the customary law, such as inheritance rights and Roois fief rights which are already mentioned in 1312, is according to historian Martin van Asseldonk possibly dating back to the days of the county. The Lords of Rode possessed goods around the Castle of Rode, but also in Eerschot, Schijndel, Veghel, Erp, Son and Liempde. There were real property of the feudal lords of Rode, including the Baexhoeve (Baex Farmstead) in Veghel and several properties in Sint-Oedenrode itself. The county Rode is possibly the precursor of the quarter Peelland. In the 14th century a small castle was built named Strijpe, it was later expanded in the 19th century and renamed Henkeshage. Duchy of Brabant With the sale of the county Rode by Otto II, Count of Guelders to Henry I, Duke of Brabant, due to an old agreement, in 1231 Sint-Oedenrode becomes a part of the Duchy of Brabant as a part of the Meierij (Bailiwick) of 's-Hertogenbosch. As a consequence of this agreement and as a compensation of the loss of their sovereignty the city becomes the administrative capital of the first known quarter Peelland. In 1232 Sint- Oedenrode got freedom rights. From then on Sint-Oedenrode and the nearby located Eerschot is referred to as De Oude Vrijheid (The Old Freeheerlijkheid). The new town had good natural defenses, as it was situated in a bend of the Dommel and was surrounded by the marshy fields called the Dommelbeemden. During this era the Sint-Oedenrode as capital of Peelland prospers. In 1355 it joins a covenant of Brabant cities. The city acquired rights and because of the administrative function Sint-Oedenrode attracted new craftsmen, who were especially settling around the large oblong marketplace. Also the clergy and nobility built several castles and fortified farms in Sint-Oedenrode, which mainly served as country stays for various noble families of the Meierij. An important estate at that time was the \\"Hertog Jaaghuis\\" (Duke's hunting lodge), which is built on the site of the former castle. Its foundations were excavated in 2004. Economic growth is reflected in the creation of various structures, such as the Knoptoren of the Sint Maarten's church in Eerschot in 1410, the foundation of the Sint Paulus Gasthuis in 1434 and the construction of a new choir at the Oda church in 1498. This chapter church was served by canons living in large private mansions. The chapter joined in 1505 the Brabants chapter covenant. The booming economy of Sint-Oedenrode receives several blows during the 16th century. During the Guelderian Wars in 1542 Rode was plundered by the Guelder field marshal Maarten van Rossum and burned down, including the parish church. The Dutch War of Independence caused more suffering: *In 1572 State troops under the Duke of Holstein plundered the city. *In 1576 the States occupier of Zaltbommel destroyed several houses in Rode. *After which the States garrison of Heusden destroyed another hundred and ten houses in 1581. *A disastrous year was 1583 when State troops under Baron of IJsselstein, after burning down the towns of Schijndel and Veghel, burnt down the entire city including the two churches on their passage. The people of Sint Michielsgestel, Gemonde, Heeswijk-Dinther, Erp, Veghel and Sint-Oedenrode had at the time already been given the order to thresh all the grain and bring it with peat and wood to Den Bosch, so it would not fall to the republic's hordes. *In 1587 the city was again plundered by State troops under the Count of Hohenlohe. The consecutive disasters in the late 16th century were devastating to the development of the city. Location in North-Brabant Staats-Brabant Since 1648 is Sint- Oedenrode part of the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands, since the Bailiwick of 's-Hertogenbosch and its belongings are allocated to the States. Sint-Oedenrode experiences a time of stagnation. Under the Staats-Brabant the city functions as a military buffer zone for the province of Holland during which time it has little to no opportunities for economic growth. In this era there are several castles and farmhouses that dilapidated or are even completely deserted. Catholic worship is forbidden, the churches closed and Saint Martin's church in Eerschot is assigned to a handful of Protestant officials. From 1649 on for several years will the people of Sint-Oedenrode be using a clandestine church in a barn in Veghel near the hamlet Duifhuis. That church was in use by the parishioners of Sint-Oedenrode, Schijndel and Veghel until the French invasion of 1672. French period and Kingdom of the Netherlands The French led by General Pichegru invade Sint-Oedenrode in 1794. The French came from the direction of Boxtel towards Sint-Oedenrode, that at that time was occupied by British troops. The British destroyed the bridges over the Dommel. Between Sint-Oedenrode and Veghel a battle took place between French and allied troops. In 1795 Sint-Oedenrode becomes a full member of the Batavian Republic. In 1809 King Louis Napoleon visites the city. Sint- Oedenrode in 1868 World War II During the Second World War Sint- Oedenrode suffered tremendously. In May 1940 the German Army invaded the Low Countries and France, and due to the retreat from the Peel-Raam Line by the Dutch Armed Forces skirmishes arouse in Sint-Oedenrode in an attempt to keep the enemy at bay. After the capitulation (15 May 1940, in Zeeland 2 days later) Sint-Oedenrode found itself under German occupation. There was a small German Luftwaffe detachment of about 15 people providing a manned look-out (just like the Royal Observer Corps) for Allied planes which were undertaking operations against the Air Bases of Volkel and Eindhoven (Airbase Welschap, now Eindhoven Air Base). During the final months of occupation the mayor (appointed by the Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands) was sacked and replaced by a pro-German mayor. The reasons for the sacking were that the central Distribution Office was plundered from blank distribution cards that were necessary to get coupons for males who were hiding from the Arbeitseinsatz (compulsory labour in the German war industry) and were using fake names. Also the mayor tried to sabotage the Arbeitseinsatz. With the beginning of Operation Market Garden in 1944, Sint-Oedenrode was situated on an important location between the Allied landing zones in Son and Veghel. General Eisenhower and Field Marshal Montgomery had the important task of keep the corridor (which ran through Sint-Oedenrode) open for the passage of the British 30th Corps to conquer Nijmegen. Monument to the Dutch In September 1944 the liberation of Sint-Oedenrode came during Operation Market-Garden envisaged by Field Marshal Bernard Law Montgomery. The US 101st Airborne Division liberated the Town of Sint-Oedenrode (the 'Market' part) after para droppings in the fields in the vicinity. They were followed by the British XXX Army Corps (the 'Garden' part). For a brief time the 18th-century castle Henkenshage was used as allied HQ. The British left 150 comrades behind, the Americans 125. Twenty-two British soldiers are buried at the General Cemetery in Sint-Oedenrode. Most of the British are reburied at the Uden War Cemetery and some did find their final resting place in Mierlo. The Americans who were originally buried in Wolfswinkel (Son en Breugel) are reburied in Margraten or the US. On September 16, 1994 101st Airborne veterans revealed a war monument 'Monument for the Dutch'. The monument is a gift from the veterans to the civilians who fought alongside of the US troops, much to surprise and relief of the US soldiers. The inscription on the monument is in English and reads \\"Dedicated to the people of the Corridor by the veterans of the 101st Airborne Division, in grateful appreciation of their courage, compassion and friendship\\". The monument can be found alongside the road 'Corridor' which was constructed after the war between key points of the actual Corridor: the allied supply route from Eindhoven to Nijmegen. Post-war era In the twentieth century mainly the growth of N.V. ODA Steel Works and Ovenbouw v/h H.J. van de Kamp, later N.V. ODA Steel Furniture (now part of the multinational Ahrend) created employment in Sint-Oedenrode.POLL, HARRY Van dorpssmidse tot grootbedrijf. Gedenkboek N.V. Oda-Staalwerk v.h. H.J. van de Kamp St. Oedenrode. 1905-1955. Sint-Oedenrode is regularly erroneously referred to as rural municipality. As a former market city the urbanization had already begun at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries. The excessive urbanization is evident from the fact that in 1930 already more than half of the population was not engaged in agriculture. After neighboring municipalities Schijndel and Veghel, Sint-Oedenrode was at the time the third most industrialized town of eastern North-Brabant. Around 1950 Sint-Oedenrode lost its third place to Uden, which began to develop quickly after it was designated as a core congregation. In 1956 only 30% of the inhabitants of Sint-Oedenrode was involved in agriculture.

He is also known as Pusar-i Kaku, Ibn Kakuyeh, Ibn Kakuya, and Ibn Kaku, which means maternal uncle in the Deylami language, and is related to the Persian word \\"kaka\\". Muhammad died in September 1041 after having carved out a powerful kingdom which included western Persia and Jibal. However, these gains were quickly lost under his successors.  Origins  Map of northern Iran Rustam Dushmanziyar, the father of Muhammad, was a Daylamite soldier in the service of Buyids and was rewarded with land in Alborz in appreciation of his services. His duty was to protect Ray and northern Jibal against the local leaders from Tabaristan. Rustam was the brother of the Bavandid princess Sayyida Shirin, the mother of Buyid emir Majd al-Dawla and Shams al-Dawla. Both were under the tutelage of their mother Khatun until her death in 1029.  Reign  Given these family ties, it is not surprising that from 1007 to 1008 Muhammad was the governor of Isfahan on behalf of the Buyids. Some sources say he was already in governor of the city in 1003. In 1016, the Daylamite military officer Ibn Fuladh expelled Muhammad from Isfahan, but he shortly managed to regain control of the city. The fragility of Majd al-Dawla's kingdom later encouraged Muhammad to extend his domains in the Kurdish held mountains of Iran. In 1023, Muhammad seized Hamadan from the Buyid ruler Sama' al-Dawla, and then proceeded to capture Dinavar and Shapur-Khwast from Kurdish leaders. He spent the following years in protecting his realm from invasions by the Kurds and princes (ispahbadh) from Tabaristan. Five years later, Muhammad won a great victory over his rivals at Nihawand, and managed to capture the Bavandid ruler Abu Ja'far Muhammad including his two sons. After this great victory, Muhammad consolidated his position as the strongest ruler of Jibal, even though the Buyid emir Majd al-Dawla was his overlord, Muhammad minted coins in his own name. He was later personally awarded, and without the intervention of the Buyids, from the Abbasid caliph Al-Qadir, the title of \\"Husam Amir al- mu'manin\\" (Sword of the commander of the faithful). In 1029, Majd al-Dawla was deposed by the Ghaznavid Mahmud. Mas'ud I, the son of the Ghaznavid sultan, who wanted to liberate the Abbasids from Buyid control, proceeded further into western Iran, where he defeated various rulers, including Muhammad, who fled to Ahvaz to seek help from the Buyids, but he quickly made peace with the Ghaznavids and returned as their vassal, where he accepted to pay an annual tribute of 200,000 dinars. The Ghaznavids, however, were not able to hold their conquests which were distant from Ghazni, without trouble. Muhammad managed to briefly occupy Ray from the Ghaznavids in 1030. In 1035, Mas'ud I again defeated Muhammad who fled to once again fled to the Buyids in Ahvaz, where he later fled to northwestern Iran. Muhammad then began recruiting a powerful force of Turkmens in order to re-gain his lost domains. In 1037/38, Muhammad, along with his forces, once again occupied Ray from Ghaznavids. In the following years, Muhammad began constructing massive defensive walls around Isfahan. Which later saved it from the Turkmen nomads who sacked and plundered some places in west and central Iran in 1038/39, including the city of Hamadan.  Death  Muhammad died in September 1041 when he was campaigning in western Persia against the Annazids. His eldest son Faramurz succeeded him in Isfahan while his younger son Garshasp I gained Hamadan. However, they had a difficult task in protecting these regions from the expansionist Seljuqs.  Legacy  Muhammad was a great military commander who managed to protect his kingdom from its neighbors, including the Buyids, Ghaznavids and Seljuqs. He invited the philosopher Avicenna to his court after Avicenna left the court of the Buyids, where he made an encyclopedia dedicated to the emir. The great philosopher and scientist died in 1037. The library of Avicenna was later plundered by the Ghaznavids who carried it off to Ghazni where it was later destroyed by the Ghurids under their ruler Ala al-Din Husayn.

It is located from Antalieptƒó and from Dusetos, in the East coast of Vasaknai Lake. In 1505 the manor was bought by the Radvilos family, at that time one of the richest in Europe. Later, it was bought by the Pliateriai family. The family became actively involved in the uprising of 1831 (Lithuania had then been annexed by Russia). This resulted in the confiscation of all their property, including the manor, by the czarist government. The manor was falling into decay until Count Jonas Mykolas Tiskevicius acquired it. The Tiskeviciai family were Lithuania's largest landowners in the 19th century. They owned the Manor until the beginning of the First World War. After Lithuania was occupied and integrated into the Soviet Union, the manor rotted away to its foundation. In 2003, the manor was acquired by its current owners, who, with financial support from the European Union Structural Funds, have brought it back to life. Today the manor property consists of a barn (the building that has been rebuilt), servant house (a brewery today with additional rooms), stabling, the ruins of the original manor and a park, which has been declared a national heritage site.

Cadi Scientific is known in the Singapore Healthcare market for its Cadi SmartSense System that is designed for tracking patients' real-time locations for automating workflow as well as monitoring patients' temperatures automatically to reduce nurses' workload.  Wireless temperature monitoring technology  Using Active RFID technology, the company developed its flagship ThermoSensor, a coin-sized battery-powered temperature sensor, to wirelessly measure body temperatures in a hospital setting. The ThermoSensor revolutionizes the way body temperatures are measured. Several clinical trials had been conducted in hospitals (including Singapore General Hospital, Tan Tock Seng Hospital, KK Women's and Children's Hospital, Tuen Mun Hospital and Union Hospital) successfully. The complete system named Cadi SmartSense Wireless Temperature Monitoring System had obtained the medical CE certification and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance.  Location tracking technology  As the ThermoSensor was built based on RFID technology, the sensor was later customized into a 2-in-1 tag for Tan Tock Seng Hospital to be used also for patient location tracking. Tan Tock Seng Hospital is the first hospital that has operationally deployed the system on all 1200 inpatients in Dec 2006 for patient location tracking. The hospital then extended the system for both wireless temperature monitoring and location tracking on all inpatients since December 2008 after the detailed successful clinical trial. A variation of the active RFID tags were also deployed in the largest hospital in Singapore, Singapore General Hospital, for enterprise-wide patient location tracking only. The hospital deployed the location tracking system operationally for all 1600 inpatients integrated with Allscripts Patient Flow solution in May 2009 to optimize bed management process from admission to discharge. The real-time location system was deployed in Sengkang General Hospital for central asset management.  Tag-to-tag communication technology  Using state-of-the-art active RFID tag-to-tag communication technology, another variation of the active RFID tags allows infant-mother and infant-cot matching. Prince Court Medical Centre, Thomson Medical Centre, Bangkok Hospital, Singapore General Hospital, KK Women's and Children's Hospital and Gleneagles Hospital were the first few hospitals that deployed the Cadi SmartSense RFID Infant Safety system to ensure that the right mother is matched to the right baby and/or right baby is put into the right cot. The system is also deployed for tracking everyone in the Singapore National Centre for Infectious Diseases for contact tracing and hand hygiene monitoring.

He studied first at St. Patricks College Armagh and then at Maynooth where he was ordained to the priesthood on 20 June 1915. He undertook postgraduate studies in St Patrick's College, Maynooth from 1915 - 1917 and was appointed professor of theology in All Hallows College Dublin where he taught for ten years before returning to his diocese to serve as a curate first in Ardee (1927-1930) and then Armagh (1930 - 1940). In 1939 he became Adm. of Armagh Parish and in 1943 he was appointed Parish Priest of Drogheda and Vicar General of the Archdiocese of Armagh.

The flood resulted in significant damage to property and caused the deaths of at least 81 people. In response to the tragedy, the Spanish government devised and enacted the Plan Sur, which rerouted the city's main river, the Turia. Background Previous floods had been recorded in Valencia in 1321, 1328, 1340, 1358, 1406, 1427, 1475, 1517, 1540, 1581, 1589, 1590, 1610, 1651, 1672, 1731, 1776, 1783, 1845, 1860, 1864, 1870 and 1897. Up to 75 floods are estimated to have taken place in the seven centuries prior to the 1957 flood. The disaster During a 3-day cold drop, heavy rain had fallen in the city and upstream along the T√∫ria river on Saturday 12 October, easing up overnight.El desbordamiento del r√≠o Turia, La Vanguardia, 15 October 1957, p10-11 The rain resumed the next morning around 07:00. The towns of Chelva, Casinos and Ademuz were particularly affected, suffering light flooding. The rain continued until 14 October. In Valencia, there was torrential rainfall around midday on the 14th. The Turia overflowed, discharging up to of water into the city. While some of the older streets in Valencia's historic centre, such as Calle del Micalet, Plaza de la Reina and Plaza del Michalet, largely escaped damage, the newer bridges and areas to the north of the river, such as Zaidia and Campanar, suffered severe damage. In the Marxalanes district, some streets were under 5 metres of water.Hasta aqu√≠ lleg√≥ la riada, ABC, 13 August 2007 The Natzaret district near Valencia port was cut off from the rest of the city. The city as a whole was left without water, gas and electricity and around 75% of commercial and industrial activity was affected. Around 5,800 homes were destroyed, leaving approximately 3,500 families homeless. The final death toll was at least 81 people. Response The local governments of Madrid, Barcelona and surrounding areas immediately offered help, although external rescue efforts were hindered by the flooding of the main roads to the city. The Spanish army was deployed alongside the emergency services to help in the cleanup operation. The flood occurred as the government was having meetings in Barcelona. The minister responsible, Luis Carrero Blanco, interrupted those meetings to put Vicente Mortes Alfonso in charge of finding temporary housing for those left homeless by the disaster. On 24 October 1957, Spanish dictator Francisco Franco visited Valencia and promised government funding for reconstruction of the city and adequate supplies to those affected. In reaction to the disaster, the Cortes Espa√±olas unanimously approved the Plan Sur on 21 December 1961.Mart√≠nez Roda, p38 This rerouted the Turia to the south of Valencia, three kilometres from its original course. The new course is long and wide. Despite objections from Quart de Poblet and Mislata, municipalities to the west of Valencia affected by the plan, work began in 1964 and finished in 1973.

He undertook postgraduate study in the Dunboyne Institute and won an STL in 1900. Throughout his priestly ministry the Cause for the Canonisation of Oliver Plunkett was a cause close to his heart and it was thus appropriate that he was appointed Parish Priest of Drogheda in 1934. He also served as Vicar General to Cardinal Joseph MacRory. Bishop of Kilmore He was appointed the Bishop of the Diocese of Kilmore by Pope Pius XI on 6 August 1937., Handbook of British Chronology, p. 437., A New History of Ireland, volume IX, p. 350. His episcopal consecration took place on 3 October 1937; the principal consecrator was Cardinal Joseph MacRory, Archbishop of Armagh, and the principal co-consecrators were Patrick MacKenna Bishop of Clogher and Edward Mulhern, Bishop of Dromore.

The term referred both to a pair of dome cars constructed by Pullman-Standard and three Budd Company domes the B&O; acquired from the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (\\"C&O;\\"). They were the first dome cars operated in the Eastern United States, following on the success of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad's \\"Vista-Domes\\" in the west. The cars entered service in 1949 and were all out of regular service by 1981. Several have been preserved.  Design  Pullman-Standard built the two original Strata-Domes. The dome area seated 24, while the lower level contained two lounges and coach seating for 42. To accommodate the lower clearances on railroads in the Eastern United States the dome sat lower on the Strata Dome than on other dome cars, instead of the standard . These cars were numbered 5550 and 5551 and given the names High Dome and Sky Dome. At the front of the car the B&O; installed a speedometer, clock, altimeter, and barometer. In December 1950 the B&O; acquired three dome-sleepers from the C&O.; The Budd Company had built these cars for the Chessie, a Washington, D.C.‚ÄìCincinnati, Ohio luxury streamliner which was cancelled before it entered service. Each of these had 24 dome seats, with 3 drawing rooms, 5 roomettes, 1 bedroom in the lower level. The B&O; numbered these 7600‚Äì7602, with the names Moonlight Dome, Starlight Dome, and Sunlight Dome. In 1952 the B&O; would mount floodlights on the Strata-Domes to enable viewing the passing scenery at night.  Service history  The two original Strata-Domes entered service on the new Columbian, which debuted on May 5, 1949. They were the first domes in regular service on the East Coast. The B&O; placed the acquired C&O; dome- sleepers on the Capitol Limited and Shenandoah. Contemporary advertising referred to \\"Strata-Dome\\" service on all three services, despite the mixed origin of the equipment. In the 1960s the B&O; would occasionally lease the three Budd-built dome-sleepers to other railroads, including the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, Canadian National Railway, and Seaboard Coast Line Railroad. The Atlantic Coast Line used the domes on its Florida Special, although operation was limited to Richmond, Virginia‚ÄìMiami, Florida because of tunnel clearances in Washington. They were the first domes to operate on the Florida route. The Seaboard Coast Line, successor to the Atlantic Coast Line, purchased the three domes from the B&O; (along with eight conventional sleeping cars) in September 1969. The domes returned to the Florida Special. The B&O; modified the two dome coaches to include a snack bar in one of the lower-level lounges. The two cars also operated on other B&O; trains such as the Cincinnatian. The High Dome, painted blue and lettered \\"American Railroads 1869‚Äì1969\\", was part of the 1969 Golden Spike Centennial Limited to mark the centennial of the first transcontinental railroad in the U.S. Both cars later ran on the final Capitol Limited run April 30, 1971 when the train was discontinued at the start of Amtrak. Amtrak acquired all five domes and operated them on various services in the 1970s. High Dome was wrecked in 1975 and scrapped in 1980. Amtrak retired its last, Starlight Dome, in October 1981. The four surviving domes are privately owned.

In 1990, a formal exchange agreement was created between UB and the Jagiellonian University in Krak√≥w, Poland, although both universities had a long-standing partnership prior to that time. In 1993 and during Greiner's tenure, the two universities expanded their agreement to include additional joint programs for students, faculty, and staff. While Greiner served as UB Provost, his actions aided the development of a relationship between UB and the Jagiellonian University. In November 2002, Greiner led a delegation to Turkey, and signed an agreement with Istanbul Technical University for student and faculty exchanges. Greiner further developed international education ties with Cuba in 1999 regarding UB's program in Havana with Fernando Remirez de Estenoz, Cuban envoy to the United States. Under Greiner's leadership, UB became the first university in the United States to establish a partnership with China, with a university center in Beijing. =Concerns= Under Greiner's tenure, there were also concerns and controversy regarding several issues. In 1993, UB's basketball team was placed on probation by the NCAA for rules violations from 1989. By 1997, two of the team's coaches had been identified as having illegally watched and attended scrimmage games. Greiner was supposedly unaware of these actions, placing responsibility for them on UB's athletic director, Nelson Townshend. Resulting from this in 2001 was that UB's annual recruitment visits were decreased by two throughout the next two years, after UB had already voluntarily reduced annual recruitment visits by two. So, annual recruitment visits were decreased, overall, from 12 to 8, a reduction that UB's administration believed to be unnecessarily harsh and planned to appeal. In 1996, UB held a university-wide referendum that was open to students regarding two issues on Greiner's agenda, including privatization and differential tuition.Greiner faces UB referendum on tuition, privatization policy, Buffalo News, Buffalo, NY: Berkshire Hathaway, 2 May 1996, Accessdate=20 December 2013. Michael Pierce, the University Council Student Representative who penned the referendum, stated that the issue was not about confidence, or lack thereof, in Greiner, but that new directions he proposed should \\"get a mandate from the university.\\" Greiner stated that students should be concerned about affordability and accessibility rather than whether or not one SUNY institution costs more to attend than another. Of the 300 UB students who rallied about the issues on the UB Amherst Campus and who proceeded, en masse, to Greiner's office, the UB president stated that their actions were \\"divisive,\\" that he was \\"not moved,\\" and that they should register to vote in Erie County. In October 1998, Cuthbert Ormond Simpkins, a surgeon and UB professor in the School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences of four years, was denied tenure by Greiner.Surgeon who is suing UB denied tenure by Greiner, Buffalo News, Buffalo, NY: Berkshire Hathaway, 6 October 1998, Brady, K., Accessdate=20 December 2013. At the time, Simpkins was suing UB, having claimed that the UB clinical practice plan funds were being misused. Through his lawsuit, he was attempting to obtain plan audit access. Simpkins received a letter dated October 1998 from UB Provost Thomas Headrick thanking him for his service, including a statement from Greiner that denied him continued support for a tenure track position. No reason was given in the letter for Greiner's removal of support for tenure of Simpkins. Canisius at UB, October 1991 Quoted about UB's football program in The Buffalo News, Greiner stated, \\"Football is tough.\\" Prior to 1977, UB's football record was .500, though budget cuts reduced the program beginning in 1977. After Greiner secured the move to Division I-A in 1999, the UB football team lost 21 of 23 games in its first two seasons. UB's record from 1999 to 2003 was 6-39 (.153) since joining the I-A level, and 3-29 (.103) versus MAC division opponents during that time period. The football team struggled for several years to be competitive in the Mid-American Conference (MAC),Series: UB - Making it in the MAC: Greiner, Arkeilpane leave seeds of growth firmly planted, Buffalo News, Buffalo, NY: Berkshire Hathaway, 14 May 2003, McKissic, R., Accessdate=21 December 2013. disclosing losses of $2.2 million associated with football as of 2003, and prior to moving to and remaining at the classification that is now known as the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) as of 2013. Before the 2013 season, the team was ranked one of the ten worst FBS teams in the nation. Greiner stated that reasons for building UB's athletic program included the attraction of out-of-state students, and alumni. Greiner was the subject of a vote of no confidence in 2000. from the university's faculty senate, prompting discussion over whether he would resign his position. Student enrollment had declined, full-time faculty positions had decreased by 100 people, and funding was being more specifically directed to certain programs, such as athletics and information technology, rather than others.UB's master builder: In a decade as university president, William R. Greiner has guided tremendous campus growth; his record in building academic excellence, though, has been less consistent, Buffalo News, Buffalo, NY: Berkshire Hathaway, 11 November 2001, Watson, S., Accessdate 20 December 2013. In particular was the concern that more than $10 million per year was going toward building UB's athletic programs, such monies being diverted away from academics. While college entrance Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores had increased, UB's status as a highly ranked research university in the United States had decreased since 1989 under the leadership of Steven Sample. This prompted the vote of no confidence in UB's leadership by the College of Arts and Sciences professors. Of the no confidence vote, in 2001 Greiner likened himself to a lightning rod that, in his employment position, occasionally gets hit by lightning. In April 2000, Greiner responded to a story published in The Buffalo News by UB English professor Mark Shechner with an op-ed article, published in the same newspaper. Greiner called Shechner's concerns about UB an exaggeration. Greiner rebutted Shechner's concerns regarding UB's reductions in student enrollment, the number of full-time faculty, decreased monies directed toward academics, and others. Among issues addressed by Greiner were the expanded use of student activity fees, UB's partnerships in the community, the state's capital investment program of nearly $200 million, more than $50 million used for student housing, and that UB adds $1.6 billion to the local economy in the Buffalo area. In a May 2000 Buffalo News editorial, UB Professor and 20-year UB employee Charles Trzcinka wrote that he was preparing to leave UB after his department was negatively affected by the president's decisions, but that he believed that Greiner should remain as UB's president.Editorial: For good of UB, Greiner should stay, Buffalo News, Buffalo, NY: Berkshire Hathaway, 7 May 2000, Trzcinka, C., Accessdate=20 December 2013. In his editorial, Trzcinka stated that UB is performing poorly based on \\"many traditional measures,\\" but is doing well by less traditional standards. Tzcinka stated that Greiner focused on building particular areas and departments at UB, while that was not done with others, contributing to decreases in numbers of faculty and students in those departments. Pointed out by Tzcinka was that information technology at UB has caused UB to be ranked highly, and that it is a source of economic growth for the region. Tzcinka also stated that university presidents must make decisions, and that while UB has faced declining resources and budget cuts, Greiner made UB a \\"dynamic, responsive university.\\" Concern also exists that Greiner did not do more to develop UB's city campus location in Buffalo, including that property values and business development faltered in the University Heights district because of it. Residents of the University Heights district stated that the construction of the apartment-style dormitory buildings on the suburban Amherst campus shows that the city campus in Buffalo is \\"excluded\\" from development. UB also stopped plans to purchase 250 homes in the University Heights area throughout a period of 10 years. Greiner stated that UB is working \\"to play a larger role\\" in the University Heights area, but that a partnership must exist. He also said that after construction began on the Amherst campus, UB's future growth was foretold.

Greiner was a member of the Thursday Club of the Buffalo area. The Thursday Club is an exclusively male club of about 60 notable men, mostly educators and attorneys. The Club has been in existence for more than 130 years, and was originally established as a type of literary club that included notable men. In 1998, the Thursday Club held a dinner meeting at UB, prompting a woman to write a letter to Greiner and other SUNY administrators regarding the possible violation of a private club that discriminates against women holding a meeting at a state-run institution. The Buffalo News quoted the letter, stating, \\"I do not know if it is a violation of state law or university policy to use university facilities to support the activities of a private club that discriminates against women, but it strikes me, at the very least, as a wildly inappropriate violation of judgment and good taste.\\" Authorships Greiner co-wrote The Nature and Functions of Law with Harold J.

The screenplay for the film was written by Lajos Biro and Benjamin Christensen who used the name Richard Bee. Production started on the film in July 26, 1928. The Haunted House was Christensen's first attempt at using sound in filme with the feature containing sound effects and a music score, in addition to Eve Southern mouthing two songs in the film which according to an article in Variety, were added in post-production. Variety also noted that the synchronization of the songs was \\"badly handled, with the player and the sound always out of kilter and neither starting out for finishing together.\\" Release The Haunted House was released on November 4, 1928. The film was released as both a silent feature and a feature with the sound additions. Reception From contemporary reviews, Variety felt the film \\"played legitimately and with no attempt to get a tongue-in-the cheek laugh. It holds every form of sliding panel and rainstorm mystery material, as did the play, but holds it all with deadly seriousness.\\" The review felt overall it was not as \\"good a film as another recent boogy-man thriller, The Terror.\\" A review in Photoplay commented that the film was \\"Too much Chester Conklin and not enough mystery\\" Film Daily praised camera work by Sol Polito, declaring him \\"a genius on atmospheric effects\\" concluding that the film had \\"thrills and laughs\\" in \\"abundance\\" despite \\"the plot standing still for several reels.\\" The film was reviewed twice in The Film Spectator, with the first reviewer stating that The Haunted House was \\"a resume of all the mystery thrillers ever done, but it can be recommended as entertaining, since its undoubtedly the best to burst fort in all its horror\\". The second review found the film to be \\"a clever picture\\" with Christensen giving \\"an eerie quality to his , an intelligent treatment of a story that is designed to give brave men goose-flesh and make cowards shriek\\". Harrison's Reports found the reviewer would be \\"held in tense suspense. Here and there the action shows some to lag for that are hard- boiled, but the general public seemed to enjoy it immensely.

Although she did not personally seek the spotlight, her role in the Enigma project that decrypted Nazi Germany's secret communications earned her awards and citations, such as appointment as a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE), in 1946. Early life Joan Elisabeth Lowther Clarke was born on 24 June 1917 in West Norwood, London, England. She was the youngest child of Dorothy (n√©e Fulford) and the Revd William Kemp Lowther Clarke, a clergyman. She had three brothers and one sister. Clarke attended Dulwich High School for Girls in south London and won a scholarship in 1936, to attend Newnham College, Cambridge, where she gained a double first degree in mathematics and was a Wrangler. She was denied a full degree, as until 1948 Cambridge awarded these only to men. Clarke's mathematical abilities were first discovered by Gordon Welchman, in an undergraduate Geometry class at Cambridge. Welchman was one of the top four mathematicians to be recruited in 1939 to supervise decoding operations at Bletchley Park. After noticing Clarke's mathematical abilities he recruited her to join him at Bletchley Park and be a part of the 'Government Code and Cypher School' (GCCS). The GCCS started up in 1939 with a single purpose: that of breaking the German Enigma Code. The Enigma was a machine invented by the Germans to encrypt their messages; they strongly believed their code was unbreakable. Clarke first arrived at Bletchley Park on 17 June 1940. She was initially placed in an all-women group, referred to as \\"The Girls\\", who mainly did routine clerical work. At this time, cryptology was not considered a job for a woman in England. According to Clarke, she knew of only one other female cryptologist working at Bletchley Park. Career=Codebreaking at Park In June 1940, Clarke was recruited by her former academic supervisor, Gordon Welchman, to the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS;). She worked at Bletchley Park in the section known as Hut 8 and quickly became the only female practitioner of Banburismus, a cryptanalytic process developed by Alan Turing which reduced the need for bombes ‚Äîelectromechanical devices as used by British cryptologists Welchman and Turing to decipher German encrypted messages during World War II. New edition updated with an addendum consisting of a 1986 paper written by Welchman that corrects his misapprehensions in the 1982 edition. Clarke's first work promotion was to Linguist Grade which was designed to earn her extra money despite the fact that she did not speak another language. This promotion was a recognition of her workload and contributions to the team. In 1941, trawlers were captured as well as their cipher equipment and codes. Before this information was obtained, wolf packs had sunk 282,000 tons of shipping a month from March to June 1941. By November, Clarke and her team were able to reduce this number to 62,000 tons. Hugh Alexander, head of Hut 8 from 1943 to 1944, described her as \\"one of the best Banburists in the section\\". Alexander himself was regarded as the best of the Banburists. He and I. J. Good considered the process more an intellectual game than a job. It was \\"not easy enough to be trivial, but not difficult enough to cause a nervous breakdown\\".Good (1993) p. 157. Clarke became deputy head of Hut 8 in 1944, although she was prevented from progressing because of her gender, and was paid less than the men.Clarke and Turing had been close friends since soon after they met, and continued to be until Turing's death in 1954. They shared many hobbies and had similar personalities. They became very good friends at Bletchley Park. Turing arranged their shifts so they could work together, and they also spent much of their free time together. In early 1941, Turing proposed marriage to Clarke, and subsequently introduced her to his family. Although privately admitting his homosexuality to her‚Äîshe was reportedly \\"unfazed\\" by the revelation‚ÄîTuring decided that he could not go through with the marriage, and broke up with Clarke in mid-1941. Clarke later admitted that she suspected Turing's homosexuality for some time, and it was not much of a surprise when he made the admission to her. After the war After the war, Clarke worked for Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) where she met Lieutenant-Colonel John Kenneth Ronald Murray, a retired army officer who had served in India. They were married by the Bishop of Chichester on 26 July 1952 in Chichester Cathedral, where her father was a Canon. Shortly after their marriage, John Murray retired from GCHQ due to ill health and the couple moved to Crail in Fife where they lived at Priorscroft, 14 Nethergate. They returned to work at GCHQ in 1962 where Clarke remained until 1977 when she retired aged 60. Following her husband's death in 1986, Clarke moved to Headington, Oxfordshire, where she continued her research into coinage. During the 1980s, she assisted Sir Harry Hinsley with the appendix to volume 3, part 2 of British Intelligence in the Second World War. She also assisted historians studying war-time code breaking at Bletchley Park. Due to continuing secrecy among cryptanalysts, the full extent of her accomplishments remains unknown. Numismatic interest After meeting her husband, who had published work on the Scottish coinage of the 16th and 17th centuries, Clarke developed an interest in numismatics history. She established the sequence of the complex series of gold unicorn and heavy groat coins that were in circulation in Scotland during the reigns of James III and James IV. In 1986, her research was recognised by the British Numismatic Society when she was awarded the Sanford Saltus Gold Medal. Issue No. 405 of the Numismatic Circular described her paper on the topic as \\"magisterial\\". Personal life Little is known about Clarke's personal interests or about her past. According to Kerry Howard, a researcher of the history of female involvement in World War II, Joan Clarke was a very private person. One of her neighbours said that she never talked about her personal background, and was quite awkward in social situations. What is known is that throughout her life, Clarke had a number of passions, such as botanical work, chess, and knitting. In 1947, Clarke met Lieutenant Colonel John Kenneth Ronald Murray, a retired army officer who had served in India. Clarke and Murray were married on 26 July 1952 in Chichester Cathedral. Death On 4 September 1996, Clarke died at her home at 7 Larkfields, Headington Quarry. An Oxfordshire Blue Plaque was unveiled on her house on 27 July 2019. Portrayal in adaptation Clarke was portrayed by Keira Knightley in the film The Imitation Game (2014), opposite Benedict Cumberbatch as Alan Turing. Turing's surviving niece, Inagh Payne, described Clarke as \\"rather plain\\" and thought that Knightley was inappropriately cast as Clarke. Biographer Andrew Hodges also criticised the film, stating the script \\"built up the relationship with Joan much more than it actually was\\". In contrast, an article by BBC journalist Joe Miller stated that Clarke's \\"story has been immortalised\\". In terms of the film itself, director Morten Tyldum has argued that it shows how Clarke succeeded in her field despite working in a time \\"when intelligence wasn't really appreciated in women\\". Knightley was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress at the 87th Academy Awards for her performance as Clarke.

She served as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the Party for Freedom from 27 September 2012 to 1 July 2014. She also is a member of the States of North Brabant since 10 March 2011. Early life and career Van der Kammen was born on 8 April 1972 in Heerlen. She studied psychology at the Tilburg University and graduated in 1999. Van der Kammen then started working as a policy employee at the same institution. Political career Since 10 March 2011 Van der Kammen is a member of the States of North Brabant. In September 2011 she introduced a motion in which she called to stop or reduce the support of pay provided to ex-States-Provincial members in North Brabant. Van der Kammen was likely to be elected to the European Parliament when the Netherlands, and with it the Party for Freedom, gained another seat to the Parliament in December 2011. However, the seat the Party for Freedom gained went to Dani√´l van der Stoep, who previously had been a member but had resigned in September 2011. Van der Stoep was allowed to return because he was the highest listed candidate on the original Party for Freedom candidate list who wished to enter the European Parliament, the Party for Freedom however did not allow him to return to their party. The return of Van der Stoep to Parliament had been unexpected and Van der Kammen had already been announced as member on the Parliament website. However, Van der Kammen succeeded Barry Madlener in the European Parliament in September 2012 while remaining a member of the States- Provincial of North Brabant. Madlener, who was number eight on the candidate list of the Party for Freedom for the 2012 Dutch general election, was chosen to the House of Representatives. Van der Kammen herself had been number 32 and was not chosen. During her time in the European Parliament she was on political leave from her job at Tilburg University, and was allowed to return when she wanted. Her term ended on 1 July 2014. Van der Kammen had been member amongst others of the Committee on Transport and Tourism and the Delegation for relations with the Korean Peninsula.

That is, it generates time series of wind speeds at a set of points on a surface, say the plane of the rotor of a wind turbine. Analysis is performed initially in the frequency domain, where turbulence can be described quantitatively with more ease than the time domain. Then, the time series are obtained by inverse fast Fourier transforms. In its original form, the Sandia method only simulates the u-component of the wind; that is, the wind was modelled as propagating in a direction perpendicular to the plane of the rotor. Work carried out by NREL, specifically Kelley, suggested that a considerable amount of turbulent energy existed in the v-component (the v-component is parallel to both the plane of the rotor and the Earth). As such, the Sandia method was upgraded such that it included the v-component and w-component. Further upgrades have been performed such that the wind profile exhibits cross-axis correlation (turbulent fluctuations in one component being somehow connected to turbulent fluctuations in another). However, these are not considered in this article.  Point-wind speed spectra  Although turbulence leads to unpredictable results in the time domain, it can, to some extent, be characterized in the frequency domain. Turbulent fluctuations are dominated by low frequency components, with higher frequency components having less influence. For further information, see Kolmogorov's theory on turbulence. Several models of frequency domain representations of point wind speeds have been developed: the von K√°rm√°n wind turbulence model and Dryden Wind Turbulence Model are examples of such. Discretizing a spectrum  A spectrum in its original form is a continuous function. However, computer programmes operate on discrete functions. Thus a modification to whatever type of spectrum, be it Kaimal, von Karman, or some other spectrum, is needed. This is given below: : S(\\\\omega_k) = S(\\\\omega = \\\\omega_k)\\\\Delta\\\\omega/2 where S(\\\\omega_k) is the discretized spectrum evaluated only at the discrete frequencies \\\\omega_k, S(\\\\omega = \\\\omega_k) is the continuous spectrum evaluated at \\\\omega = \\\\omega_k and \\\\Delta\\\\omega is the size of the step between consecutive frequencies being considered.  Coherence  When generating a time series of wind speeds for a set of points across a surface, coherence needs to be taken into account. That is, the instantaneous wind speed at some point, A, will bear some resemblance to the wind speed at some other point, B. Clearly, the resemblance is influenced by the separation of points A and B. That is, two points separated by a large distance will show less similarity to each other than two neighbouring points on the surface. In addition, one would expect low frequency components of the wind speeds at points A and B to show more correlation than high frequency components. As such, many coherence functions have been proposed: Davenport, Solari, etc. The Solari coherence spectrum is provided as an example: : Coh_{ijk} = \\\\exp^{-2C\\\\Delta r_{ij} \\\\omega_k/(u_i + u_j)} where C is a constant, \\\\Delta r_{ij} is the separation of points i and j on the surface, \\\\omega_k is the frequency, and u_i and u_j are the mean wind speeds at points i and j respectively. The indices i and j run from 1 to n, and the index k covers the frequency range. From the coherence function stems the coherence matrix. To cover all relationships between all points, the coherence function must be an n^2-by-n^2-by-\\\\omega matrix. Clearly, the coherence matrix is symmetric about the main diagonal if we are restricting ourselves to looking at the coherence function at a single frequency. This is because the spatial separation between points A and B is the same as the spatial separation between B and A. That is, for a n-by-n grid, only (n^4 + n^2)/2 elements need to be calculated for each frequency. It is worth noting at this point that whilst the coherence matrix is strictly a 3-dimensional matrix (i, j, and k), computer programmes which implement the Sandia method typically reduce the coherence matrix to a 2-dimensional matrix where the frequency dimension has been 'removed'. This is to ease computational requirements. A 2-dimensional matrix is also required to perform some of the actions on the spectral matrix, such as a Cholesky decomposition, which is mentioned later. Of course, variation in frequency is still applied. However, the following process is carried out in full for one given frequency before proceeding to the next frequency. As such, in the following section, a power spectrum refers to the value of the power spectrum at a given frequency and not the full set of values across the frequency range being used. That is, : Coh_{ijk} \\\\rightarrow Coh_{ij}(\\\\omega_k) and S_{ijk} \\\\rightarrow S_{ij}(\\\\omega_k) where an element of S, S_{ijk} , would have given the strength of the spectrum at a particular frequency \\\\omega_k at a particular point in space.  Generating turbulence  Power spectra are needed for each of the n^2 points on the surface; this encapsulates information about the turbulence intensity for each point. Under IEC standards, only one power spectrum is used; that is, all n^2 points have the same turbulence intensity. With the power spectra, the spectral matrix can be formed. This a n^2-by-n^2 matrix. The main diagonal of the spectral matrix contains the previously defined spectra for all n^2 points on the surface. The off-main diagonal elements contain all the cross spectra between the points. The cross spectra are determined by the following function: : S_{ij}(\\\\omega_k) = Coh_{ij}(\\\\omega_k)\\\\sqrt{S_{ii}(\\\\omega_k)S_{jj}(\\\\omega_k)} Due to the symmetry of the coherence matrix, only (n^4 + n^2)/2 elements are independent. This property can be exploited to lighten memory requirements when writing a programme to simulate the Sandia method. The spectral matrix, S(\\\\omega_k), can be written as the matrix product of a matrix, H(\\\\omega_k), and its transpose. That is, : S(\\\\omega_k) = H(\\\\omega_k)H(\\\\omega_k)^T H(\\\\omega_k) is ultimately needed to obtain the complex Fourier co-efficients of the Fourier transforms of the time series of the wind speeds at all the points on the surface. Note - if the Fourier transform of a time domain function, x(t), is X(\\\\omega), then the resultant spectrum is S(\\\\omega) \\\\propto X(\\\\omega)X^*(\\\\omega); for multiple time domain functions, the Fourier co-efficients can be stored in a matrix, which then means that the above equation is applicable. Obviously, there are an infinite number of solutions to the above expression; consequently, the assumption that H(\\\\omega_k) is a lower triangular matrix is made such that only one solution exists. The solution can be found via a Cholesky decomposition. The resultant H(\\\\omega_k) matrix can be thought of as the weighting factors for the linear combination of N independent, unit-magnitude, white-noise inputs that will yield N correlated outputs with the correct spectral matrix.Veers - Three-dimensional wind simulation To get the complex Fourier co-efficients associated with the Fourier transform of the time series of the wind speeds, a column vector, V is obtained by multiply the H(\\\\omega_k) matrix by a column vector containing n^2 values of Gaussian white noise, X(\\\\omega_k), as shown below: : V(\\\\omega_k) = H(\\\\omega_k)X(\\\\omega_k) The column vector gives the Fourier co-efficients for all points on the grid at a given frequency. This is then built up into a two dimensional matrix which covers the complex Fourier co-efficients for all points across all frequencies. Then, an inverse fast Fourier transform is performed to get the time series. That is, : V_i(\\\\omega_k) \\\\rightarrow V_{ik} References Category:Wind Category:Fluid dynamics Category:Wind turbines ","title":"Sandia method"},{"id":"40962939","text":"Brett Phillips is a Scotland international rugby league footballer who plays as a forward for Whitehaven in the Betfred League 1.

Plot summary The Nighthawk, which is a nightjar, is bullied and teased by the other birds for his appearance. He is described as an ‚Äúugly bird‚Äù with an evenly dotted face and legs so weak he can barely walk. Even a lark who is not that beautiful thinks himself to be more superior to the Nighthawk. However, when it comes to the real Hawk, none of the other birds dare to insult him. The Hawk knows and dislikes the fact Nighthawk has ‚Äúhawk‚Äù in his name. He always threatens him and one night he confronts Nighthawk at his home demanding that he change his name. Hawk even recommends changing it to ‚ÄúICHIZO‚Äù which he thinks is not that bad. However Nighthawk does not wish to because it is a name given to him by God. It is the one thing he values the most: his identity. Hawk leaves and states that if he does not place a tag around his neck with ‚ÄúICHIZO‚Äù and inform all the birds of his new name he will kill him. Nighthawk sadly contemplates why all the birds dislike him so much ‚Äì all just because of his appearance. He flies out to the clouds where some insects fly into his mouth awkwardly and realizes that he too, is killing them just as the hawk plans to kill him. He thinks he should starve, stop killing insects and decides to fly far away. He bids farewell to his younger brother, the Kingfisher and asks him to convey his best wishes to their sister the Hummingbird. Nighthawk returns to his home crying. The next day he flies to the Sun asking to take him even if his body is burned but the Sun replies that since he is a night bird it will be better to ask the stars during the evening. As Nightfall hits, Nighthawk flies to the skies and asks the star of the West, Orion, to take him but his request is completely ignored. Nighthawk flies staggering down but regains momentum and flies back to the sky. Next he asks the star of the South, the Great Dog. However his request is mocked and rejected as well. Again he falls to the ground but flies back up. This time he asks the star of the North, the Great Bear. The Great Bear replies that his request is non- sense and that he should cool off. Disappointed, nighthawk flies down but recovers and asks the star of the East, the Hawk to take him. Hawk calls his request absurd and replies that you need status and money to become a star. With no more energy left Nighthawk plummets to the ground but just one foot before reaching it, he skyrockets towards the sky. Midway through he croaks like the hawk, ‚Äúkishi, kishi, kishi‚Ä¶.‚Äù. Soon his body becomes cold, his breath frozen and the air extremely thin. He does not know if he is falling or flying but he is in a peaceful state of mind. After sometime, Nighthawk opens his eyes and sees that he is glowing blue beside the star, Cassiopeia. Now nighthawk‚Äôs star glows on forever, even to this day.

The original work was written by Kanami and was later reworked by Mishima Yukio for modern theatre. The kanji ÂçíÂ°îÂ©Ü means stupa andÂ∞èÁî∫ is the synonym of belle or beautiful woman. The story was written in 1952 and published in 1956. It was translated by Japanese literature expert Donald Keene into English in 1957. Sotoba Komachi is the third story of The Five Modern Noh Plays. In relation to Sotoba Komachi by Kanami The original work, Sotoba Komachi written by Kan'ami, was originally a conversation between two priests and a 99-year-old lady at a Buddhist shrine. She later admits that she is Ono no Komachi (one of the six great waka poets in Heian period). She is then possessed by Captain Fukakusa (one of Komachi‚Äôs suitors) angry spirit and confesses to visiting Komachi for 99 nights in order to earn her love but lacking one and dying in agony. Mishima reworked the story and borrowed the characters (the old lady and Captain Fukakusa) from Kanami‚Äôs Sotoba Komachi. Plot Mishima reset the story in a 1950s urban park. At the beginning of the story, five couples are sitting on the benches and embracing. A 99-year- old lady appears in the park to gather cigarette butts. A poet sees her and admonishes her for disturbing the lovers and for using a park bench that rightfully belongs to those in love. They debate life and love. The old lady confesses that when young she was a beautiful woman and was admired by Captain Fukakusa. Upon describing a dance she attended, she and the poet find themselves at the dance, many years earlier, in Rokumei Hall, a ballroom where many handsome men and beautiful women are dancing. Everyone in the ballroom recognizes the old woman as the beautiful Komachi and comment on her beauty. The poet is surprised that the old, ugly, and wrinkled woman has become a beautiful young woman and falls in love with her. Despite Komachi‚Äôs warning that all the men who compliment her beauty die, he can‚Äôt stop himself. He professes his love for her because of her beauty. His last words before he dies are ‚ÄúI will meet you again, I am sure, in a hundred years, at the same place.‚Äù Everything returns to the present. Komachi is again an old woman counting the cigarette butts she has gathered. A policeman discovers the dead poet‚Äôs body. He asks Komachi if she knows anything about the body. She says that he tried to seduce her, but the policeman doesn‚Äôt believe her. Plays Sotoba Komachi is one of the more popular plays among Mishima‚Äôs The Five Modern Noh Plays. The play has been performed in many countries besides Japan such as the United States, Malaysia, and France. A series of DVD adapted from The Five Modern Noh Plays was released to celebrate Mishima‚Äôs 90th birthday. Both Sotoba Komachi and Aoi no Ue were released on October 31, 2013.

He also inherited family artworks from both his father and his sister, an accomplished artist in her own right. Following World War II and the denazification process he became Director of the Art Association for the Rhineland and Westphalia, until his death in a car accident at the age of 61. His personal collection of over 1,500 items, including works by Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Paul C√©zanne, Paul Gauguin, Henri Matisse, Eug√®ne Delacroix, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Franz Marc, Marc Chagall, √âdouard Manet, Camille Pissarro, Auguste Rodin, Otto Dix, Edvard Munch, Gustave Courbet, Max Liebermann, Wassily Kandinsky and Paul Klee, among many others, remained virtually unknown until it was brought to public attention in 2013 following its confiscation from the possession of his son, Cornelius Gurlitt, who, although never reunited with the collection, bequeathed it upon his death in 2014 to the Museum of Fine Arts Bern in Switzerland. Early life Gurlitt was born into an artistic family in Dresden in 1895. His father Cornelius Gurlitt (senior) was an architect and art historian, his brother Willibald a musicologist, his sister Cornelia a painter and his cousin Wolfgang was an art dealer as well. His grandmother Elisabeth Gurlitt was Jewish, which would prove problematic under Nazi rule: he was considered a \\"quarter-Jew\\" under the Nuremberg laws. After completing his schooling, he showed an interest in art history and registered to study this subject at the Dresden Technical School, where his father was Chancellor, however in 1914 World War I commenced and both Hildebrand and his elder brother Wilibald volunteered to join the German army of the day. Hildebrand served and was wounded at both the Somme and in Champagne, and later served as an army press officer in Vilnius and Kaunas in Lithuania, where he remained until 1919. Returning to a shattered Germany after demobilization, he was disillusioned with all aspects of war and politics and vowed henceforth to devote himself to art alone as an escape from politics, an irony which has not escaped subsequent biographers.Hickley, 2015: pp. 28-30. Gurlitt had a close relationship with his sister Cornelia (born 1890), who was an expressionist painter and was in contact with Chagall. She also served in the First World War as a nurse and moved to Berlin shortly after the war. The lack of artistic recognition and depression led to her suicide in 1919; Gurlitt took care of her works, but part of it was destroyed by their mother after the death of their father. Following the end of the war, Gurlitt resumed his studies in art history, first in Frankfurt, then Berlin, then in 1921 once again in Frankfurt, where he was awarded his doctorate in 1924 for a thesis on the Gothic architecture of St. Catherine's Church in Oppenheim. In 1923 he had married the ballet dancer Helene Hanke who was trained under expressionist dancer Mary Wigman. They later had two children, Rolf Nikolaus Cornelius, known as Cornelius (junior) (1932‚Äì2014) and Nicoline Benita Renate (originally known as Renate, later as Benita) (1935‚Äì2012). Early career Museum in Zwickau Between 1921 and 1924, Gurlitt contributed articles on art for newspapers, and following his graduation, he became the first director of the K√∂nig Albert museum in Zwickau in 1925. One of the first exhibitions he organized at Zwickau was the October 1925 exhibition of Max Pechstein. Financially it was a success, but it generated a lot of hostility from local conservatives. In 1926 he contracted the Bauhaus Dessau for the design and decoration of the museum. Later on he continued exhibiting contemporary art: in 1926 K√§the Kollwitz and a special exhibition on contemporary art in Dresden (Das junge Dresden), in 1927 Erich Heckel and Karl Schmidt-Rottluff, and in 1928 Emil Nolde. A collection of his letters shows that he was personally well acquainted with modern artists at the time, and he acquired and exhibited works by many of them, including Barlach, Feininger, Hofer, Kandinsky, Kirchner, Klee, Kokoschka, Lissitzky, Marc, and Munch. Gurlitt's work was appreciated by the national press and his peers, but the local press was less impressed. The city's financial difficulties and press campaigns against him led to his dismissal in 1930. Following his dismissal Gurlitt moved to Hamburg, where he became the curator and managing director of the Kunstverein (Art Association) until he and the board members were forced to resign by the Nazis, in 1933. Nazi era From the mid 1930s onwards, Gurlitt purchased and, in some cases, onsold artworks, often bought for low prices, from private individuals including Jewish owners who were under duress to pay extortionate taxes, or were otherwise liquidating assets in order to flee the country. On the one hand he claimed he was helping the owners in their predicament, since there were few dealers who were prepared to undertake such transactions, but on the other he was not averse to enriching himself in the process, as well as providing no cooperation to post-war claimants seeking to reclaim or obtain compensation for such works sold under duress.Hickley, 2015: pp. 46-47, 128-129. Gurlitt was one of the four dealers appointed by the Commission for the Exploitation of Degenerate Art (together with Karl Buchholz, Ferdinand M√∂ller and Bernhard B√∂hmer) to market confiscated works of art abroad. Some 16,000 so-called \\"degenerate\\" artworks had been removed from museums and confiscated all over Germany. Some of these works were exhibited in the Degenerate Art Exhibition. A trading room was set up in Sch√∂nhausen Palace outside Berlin. The four dealers were allowed to buy pieces and sell them abroad, which they did not always report to the commission. Gurlitt's name appears against many of the entries on a listing compiled by the Ministry of Propaganda and now held by the Victoria and Albert Museum that provides details of the fate of each object, including whether it was exchanged, sold or destroyed.Victoria and Albert Museum (2014). \\"Entartete\\" Kunst: digital reproduction of a typescript inventory prepared by the Reichsministerium f√ºr Volksaufkl√§rung und Propaganda, ca. 1941/1942. London: Victoria and Albert Museum. (V&A; NAL MSL/1996/7) http://www.vam.ac.uk/entartetekunst Gurlitt used his position to sell art to domestic collectors as well, most notably to Bernhard Sprengel whose collection forms the core of the Sprengel Museum in Hannover. In 1936 Gurlitt was visited in Hamburg by Samuel Beckett. Following the fall of France, Hermann G√∂ring appointed a series of Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce approved dealers, including Gurlitt, to acquire French art assets for Hitler's planned F√ºhrermuseum which he wanted to build in Linz; some of the works also went to swell G√∂ring's personal art collection. Gurlitt, who had already embarked on purchasing trips to Paris on behalf of German Museums, purchased around 200 works in Paris and the Netherlands between 1943 and 1944, not including works acquired for his own collection, of which 168 were intended for the F√ºhrermuseum.Hickley, 2015: pp. 78-85 Gurlitt undoubtedly used his thus \\"officially sanctioned\\" purchasing trips to Paris, which was at that time awash with artworks including old masters, of dubious provenance and including items now recognised as being looted, to further enrich his own holdings, and also became very wealthy from commissions on the enormous amounts of money being paid by Hitler's regime for artworks at that time. Post-war Sworn Statement to the Allies by Dr. H. Gurlitt, 1945 (Translation) Gurlitt List of confiscated works prepared by CCP Wiesbaden, 1950 Gurlitt was captured with his wife and twenty boxes of art in Aschbach (Schl√ºsselfeld) in June 1945. Under interrogation after capture, Gurlitt and his wife told United States Army authorities that in the fire bombing of Dresden of February 1945 much of his collection and his documentation of art transactions had been destroyed at his home in Kaitzer Strasse. One hundred and fifteen pieces taken from him by American and German authorities were returned to him after he had convinced them that he had acquired them lawfully. Among those were Lion Tamer by Max Beckmann and Self-Portrait by Otto Dix, which Gurlitt passed on to his son Cornelius. Gurlitt successfully presented himself to his assessors as a victim of Nazi persecution due to his Jewish heritage, and negotiated the release of his possessions. Whether or not portions of his collection and records of business transactions were destroyed in Dresden as Gurlitt claimed, additional portions apparently had been successfully hidden in Franconia, Saxony and Paris, from which they were retrieved after the war.Hickley, 2015: pp. 112, 117. By 1947, Gurlitt had resumed trading in art works and eventually in 1948-49 took up a position as Director of the Art Association for the Rhineland and Westphalia, based in D√ºsseldorf, which in 1949 was allocated space in the D√ºsseldorf art gallery in which to stage exhibitions. Over the next five years he staged over 70 exhibitions of leading modern artists and brokered the sale of paintings with at least some of the proceeds going to the Association, while at the same time dealing privately and purchasing works for his own collection, including Courbet's Village Girl with Goat for which he paid the then very large sum of 480,000 French Francs.Hickley, 2015: pp. 125-127. He also lent works from his collection for several travelling exhibitions: one such show, \\"German Watercolors, Drawings and Prints: A Mid-Century Review\\" included 23 works from Hildebrand's collection and toured the United States up to and beyond his premature death at age 61 in a car crash in 1956.Hickley, 2015: pp. 127-128. A year before his death, he prepared a six page manuscript preface for an exhibition catalogue which was, however, never printed; with one crucial page missing (covering his work for the Nazis), it survives in a D√ºsseldorf archive and provides a heavily sanitised personal review of his career to date and on some aspects of the history of his collection.'A Kind of Fief': Munich Art Hoarder's Father in His Own Words Reputation and reappraisal Gurlitt was generally successful at ridding himself of Nazi-associated \\"taint\\" after the war and went on to build a respectable career in Germany as an art association director and exhibition manager, art dealer and collector. Upon his death, he was celebrated in German newspaper articles and speeches for his championing of modern art and its creators, and even had a street named after him in D√ºsseldorf.Hickley, 2015, p. 130. More recent appraisals have veered, sometimes violently, to the other extreme, denouncing him as \\"Hitler's art dealer\\" and a Nazi collaborator and profiteer, with no empathy for the Jewish victims of the Nazi regime from whom many of the artworks originated, whether procured for himself, traded, or purchased for his Nazi masters' collections. Gurlitt himself offered the partial explanation that he had \\"saved\\" many of the works from destruction, either by the Nazis, by allied bombardment or confiscation, or by further looting by the Soviets following the Allied liberation of Europe; although there is an element of truth in this, another driver was clearly his own personal enrichment, as well as ensuring his and his family's survival during the Nazi era and a desire to avoid military service. For critic James McAuley, writing in \\"Even\\" magazine after viewing the two recent public exhibitions of selected works from the collection, Gurlitt was a morally bankrupt and \\"dreadfully mediocre art dealer whose animating principle seems to have been profit and professional advancement\\" who \\"made his career in the arts, but without any real distinction\\", \\"swindled them all\\" and went on to state: \\"The art in Bonn and Bern adds up to a collection of no particular distinction, larded with trite, second-tier works on paper by artists of middling distinction, and the real, unexpected achievement of \\"Status Report\\" is that it exposes the truth about Hildebrand Gurlitt ‚Äî his mediocrity, his uncomplicated interiority, his utter predictability\\",Love and Theft by James McAuley although other commentators are much less dismissive about the collection's quality (see note). Writing in 2018, Rebecca O'Dwyer says: Author Catherine Hickey offered her own assessment of Gurlitt's actions in 2015: Survival of art collection Franz Marc ‚Äì Pferde in Landschaft (Horses in Landscape) Max Liebermann's Two Riders On The Beach in the Gurlitt collection and now passed on to the descendants of the original Jewish owner Far from being mostly lost in the war as Gurlitt had claimed, around 1,500 artworks remained in Gurlitt's possession at the time of his death, passing to his wife Helene and thence to their son Cornelius (with some to his sister Renate) following her own death in 1964. They remained in the younger generation of Gurlitts' possession for over four decades out of public knowledge, although Cornelius is known to have sold eleven works via the Galerie Kornfeld in Bern, Switzerland, in 1988, and possibly four others in 1990,Hickley, 2015, p. 156. as well as Max Beckmann's The Lion Tamer which sold at auction in 2011, with the proceeds split between Cornelius and a relative of the painting's original Jewish owners. Helene had earlier sold three paintings, including Picasso's Portrait of a Woman with Two Noses, via the auction house of Ketterer in Stuttgart in 1960, plus offered Bar, Brown by Max Beckmann, which failed to sell; Cornelius later subsequently sold the same painting via Ketterer again in 1972.Hickley, 2015, pp. 150-151. In 2007, August Macke's Woman with a Parrot, also with a Hildebrand Gurlitt provenance, was sold in Berlin via the auction house Villa Grisebach for ‚Ç¨2 million;Strong German Auctions Reflect Vibrancy of European Art Market the seller was an unnamed German collector, suspected by investigative author Catherine Hickey to have been Cornelius' sister Renate (Benita).Hickley, 2015, p. 165. On 22 September 2010, German customs officials at the German‚ÄìSwitzerland border found Cornelius, by then aged 77, to be carrying ‚Ç¨9,000 in cash which he explained was money from the previous sale of a painting, which led to a search warrant in 2011 for his apartment in Schwabing, Munich. On 28 February 2012 officials from the Augsburg Prosecutors Office discovered found 1,406 artworks, the bulk of Hildebrand's original collection, with a reported estimated worth (subsequently found to be greatly exaggerated) of one billion Euros (approx. $1.3 billion), which they then confiscated. Authorities initially banned reporting on the raid, which only came to light in 2013. Subsequently Cornelius' legally appointed custodian obtained an agreement that the collection be returned since there was no evidence that Cornelius had broken any German laws, however nothing had been returned by the time of Cornelius' death. An additional portion of the collection was disclosed by Cornelius to his court-appointed lawyer to be stored at his residence in Salzburg, Austria, where he officially resided and was registered for tax purposes; these items remained in Cornelius' possession since the German authorities had no jurisdiction there. Cornelius, apparently aggrieved at the treatment he had received from the German authorities, bequeathed the entire collection on his death in 2014 to a small museum in Switzerland, the Museum of Fine Arts Bern, who in November 2014 agreed to accept the bequest, minus any works for which the possible status as wartime looted art was still in question.Bern museum accepts controversial art hoard Exhibitions of some of the works from the collection went on show in November 2017.Works hoarded by son of Nazi art dealer to go on public displayCornelius Gurlitt's art hoard finally gets first public showingExhibition Gurlitt: Status Report ¬´Degenerate Art¬ª ‚Äì confiscated and sold List of publications by Hildebrand Gurlitt * Baugeschichte der Katharinenkirche in Oppenheim a.

(1842‚Äì1910) was an Irish prelate of the Roman Catholic Church who served as the Bishop of Kilmore from 1907 to 1910. Early life and education It is uncertain where exactly he was born but believed to be in either the townlands of Tonylion or Kilnaleck in the civil parish of Crosserlough, County Cavan, Ireland on 1 August 1842. Boylan was ordained a priest for the Diocese of Kilmore on 31 March 1867. A bright student, he joined the staff of Maynooth College and served there as Bursar. The Redemptorists The Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer arrived in the UK in the 1860s and experienced great growth. At the invitation of several Irish bishops the order came to Ireland in the 1870s and many of the early priests were already diocesan clergy.https://issuu.com/redcoms/docs/redsnewsjune2017online Boylan felt a calling to the values of the order and was professed a priest of the Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer on 15 October 1888. When the houses in Ireland were separated from the houses in England in 1898 to form a stand- alone province, Boylan became the first Irish Superior.http://www.santalfonsoedintorni.it/Spicilegium/27/SH-27-1979(I)228-255.pdf In this role Boylan was responsible for the arrival of the Irish Redemptorists in Cebu Philippines in 1906 after a long period of consultation with the Holy See and the civil authorities in the Philippines.http://redemptorists- cebu.com/about-us/history-of-redemptorist-in-the-philippines/ He travelled extensively to Italy, the United States and the Philippines and it was little surprise that, when the vacancy occurred, when he was nominated for his native diocese as Bishop of Kilmore.

Located in the valley of the same name, the parochial church of Santa B√°rbara was constructed sometime in the early 15th century and served the impoverished parish throughout its history, supported by personal donations and community assistance.  History  Igreja de Santa B√°rbara (√Ålbum A√ßoriano, 1903). The oldest reference to the temple was encountered in the testament of Jo√£o Tom√©, the \\"Amo\\", dated 13 March 1537, who indicated that the current church was established on chapel constructed in the same century.Francisco Carreiro da Costa (1955‚Äì56), p.130 From the work of Gaspar Frutuoso, the temples first cura was the Micalense Bartolomeu Luiz.Gaspar Frutuoso Gaspar, Saudades da Terra, Livro III At the time of this chronicler (sometime at the end of the 16th century) the vicary of Santa B√°rbara was awarded 24$000 reis, and later (1700), the parish received seven moios and 19 alqueires of wheat, in addition to 10$333 r√©is. Between 1571 and 1616 it was its parish priest, Father Manuel Fernandes Velho, who was captured and imprisoned by Barbary coast pirates, when they raided the island. In his testament T√©touan, this clergyman left a moio of wheat to his church, in order to gild the retable at the time of its remodeling. In 1661 the parishioners were challenged to expand the church, and were directed to the Mesa da Consi√™ncia e Ordens (Bureau of Awareness and Orders) in order to obtain an eight bell carillon. Around 1666 it was necessary to decorate the apse, and the cleric ordered a silver monstrance, to replace the simple wooden ostensorium. In 1762, another campaign was begun to expand the church. A humble community, an examination of the parochial records, the church was dependent on the efforts of its residents to influence the Commanders in order to support and maintain the cult. In May 1674, the bishop (Friar Louren√ßo de Castro while on a visit to the church, ordered the vicarage priest to begin ordering from the ombudsman the materials to start the expansion of the church. The church was referenced by Monte Alverne (1986) at the end of the 17th century, identifying a vicarage, curate and treasury In 1696, there was a prohibition by the bishopric to hold a Christmas Eve feast in the sacristy on the night of Holy Thursday. A new intervention occurred in 1825, marked by a plaque at the base of the cross of the frontispiece pinnacle. Father Manuel do Couto Benevides was parish priest here; natural of the parish of √Ågua de Pau (where he was born on 24 November 1849), he was a musician and author of various works, still today sund in the churches of the island. Still in the comarca of Vila do Porto, he was responsible for legal advocacy by the local population, for his eloquent oratory. The church had a social centre and supported several religious associations during its history. At the end of the 1950s, it was refurbished and renovated under the initiative of its curate, Cl√°udio de Medeiros Franco. The feast of the patron saint occurs annually in December, with mass and procession.  Architecture  The retable of the church, with wood-gilded altarpiece In masonry stone plastered and whitewashed, the church consists of a main rectangular nave, chancel, bell- tower and several corps corresponding to the baptistery, the chapels, sacristy and false transept. The facade faces the Caminho Velho, with the curvilinear frontispiece marked by the main portico and surmounted by window, with gross pinnacles on either corners. A cornice that separates the frontispiece and pinnacles on the facade accompany the curve of the archway to the corners. The doorway is limited by portico of vertical pilasters, salient cornices and embedded pinnacles. The three-story rectangular bell-tower, whose third-story belfry is limited by cornice and with archways. The tower was decorated by cornices, stonework guard (with crosses in bass relief), surmounted by pinnacles on four corners. The single-nave interior includes angular presbytery while the high-choir, in wood, overhangs the entrance. There are lateral chapels at the front alongside the main altar, marked by Roman arches that lead into the false transept and the two lateral chapels. The triumphal arch, much like the chapels, are decorated with Roman arches. In the main altarpiece is an image of Santa B√°rbara, on the left, an image of Nossa Senhora do Carmo, while on the right S√£o Louren√ßo. The lateral altars were dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, S√£o Jos√© and Santo Ant√≥nio, on the left, and, on the right, the Sacred Heart of Mary. In the body of the church are smaller spaces with altar dedicated to Senhor Santo Cristo and for the baptistery.

The design was started November 1913 but its construction was a low priority for the company and the completed aircraft was not delivered to Brooklands until July 1914.

The Minneriya Tank was built by the great tank builder, King Mahasen (276‚Äì303) who ruled in Anuradhapura. This tank occupied 4670 acres and its strong 13-meter-tall dam running along a distance of 2 km held over 20 billion gallons of water. The water arrived from Amban River, the main tributary of Mahaveli River, 48 km away, along the Elahara canal built by King Vasabha (65‚Äì109) before his time. This, along with other reservoirs created an irrigation paradise in the east. It was this growth in agriculture that opened up the massive trade with South East Asia through the Trincomalee harbor. From then onwards, Trincomalee harbor became one of the busiest in the region. In 1820 AD, British Inland Revenue Officer Ralf Bachaus recorded that the whole area can be irrigated if this reservoir is restored. In 1856, British Governor Henry Ward recorded that it must have been an amazing reservoir which had been built very strong. They recorded the beauty of the vegetation, the wildlife which surrounded the reservoir.

It honors the poet, philosopher and historian Friedrich Schiller, who is also regarded as one of the most significant dramatists and lyricists of the German language. The set of statues was executed by Reinhold Begas a prominent 19th-century German sculptor. It is a registered historic monument. Historical origin Throughout Germany celebrations took place on 10 November 1859 to commemorate the 100th birthday of Friedrich Schiller (1759‚Äì1805). In Berlin funds were raised to erect a monument for the purpose, with Crown Prince Wilhelm (later Kaiser Wilhelm I) and the city of Berlin each donating 10,000 Thaler and the population 12,680 Thaler. On the day of celebration the foundation stone for the planned monument was laid, although a specific design did not yet exist. The city called for proposals, and in 1864 a decision was finally made in favor of Reinhold Begas. The monument was the first major commission of his career and thereafter led to orders for numerous monumental sculptures in Berlin and elsewhere. The Franco-Prussian war of 1870/71 delayed the unveiling, which took place on 10 November 1871, the 112th anniversary of Schiller‚Äôs birthday. The occasion was used to lay out a garden on the central part of Gendarmenmarkt, which was renamed Schillerplatz at the close of that year. This name remained until 1936. The monument The statue being returned to its original location in 1986 The statue of the poet stands on a cube-shaped pedestal surrounded by four semicircular basins, above which there are water spouts in the form of lion heads. Although the memorial has the design of a fountain it was never used as such. Schiller wears a crown of laurel leaves and is depicted as a young, self-assured man. The model for the head was the Schiller bust made in 1794 by the sculptor Johann Heinrich von Dannecker, a friend of Begas. Four allegorical figures sit on the edges of the basins and depict the writer‚Äôs main areas of creative activity. At front left is Lyric Poetry with a swan-headed harp; at front right Tragedy, with the attribute of a mask. In the back are History, with names including Schiller, Lessing, Kant, Goethe and other famous people on her tablets, and Philosophy, holding a scroll with a text in Ancient Greek: ‚ÄòKnow Thyself‚Äô. The pedestal bears inscriptions relating to Schiller and two small bas reliefs which show Schiller receiving a lyre from the muses and being introduced to great writers of former times. During the Third Reich Gendarmenmarkt was turned into a parade ground in 1936. The decorative gardening was removed, the Schiller monument dismantled and put into storage. There is a bronze copy in the southern part of Schiller Park in the Berlin locality of Wedding. The metal used was from a memorial fountain for Emil and Walther Rathenau, originally erected in 1930 in a large public park, Volkspark Rehberge, but removed from this location by the Nazis in 1934 for ideological reasons and melted down in 1941. The marble original of the Schiller statue was placed in Lietsensee Park, which was in one of the Western sectors into which the city was divided after World War II. The monument‚Äôs heavily damaged allegorical figures were stored in Friedrichsfelde zoo in East Berlin. An East-West cultural agreement of 6 May 1986 was the precondition for reuniting all the surviving parts in East Berlin. In 1988 the partially reconstructed and partially restored monument was rebuilt at its original location on Gendarmenmarkt. In autumn 2006 extensive renovation was undertaken. The entire monument was cleaned, small missing pieces were replaced and joints were filled. Rust was removed from the decorative cast iron railing and it was repainted.

Completed in 1932,Powers (2005), pp. 138‚Äì139. it is a Grade II listed building. It replaced an 1874 Arts and Crafts style house designed by Philip Webb, which itself replaced an earlier house of that name. Greene also had an additional house, The Wilderness, built in the grounds of Joldwynds, to a design by the modernist architectural partnership Tecton. This house, completed in 1939, is also Grade II listed. Arts and Crafts style house The original house called Joldwynds was acquired by surgeon and anatomist William Bowman,Dibble (2002), pp. 84‚Äì86. later Baronet of Holmbury St Mary, following the death in 1870 of its owner, Henry Champion Wetton. In the same year, Bowman commissioned Philip Webb to design a replacement house in Arts and Crafts style, which was completed in 1874. It was square, with three gables on each of the four sides, plus a wing extending diagonally from one corner, containing a laboratory and a billiards room. The centre of the house was occupied by a three-storey, octagonal living hall, surrounded by round arches at ground level and an arcade on the next floor, and topped by a roof lantern. A stair turret and a barrel-vaulted library were added in 1893.Kirk (2005), pp. 114‚Äì117. The house became an influential example to other Arts and Crafts architects of the Victorian era.Stamp (2010), pp. 184‚Äì185. This house was demolished in 1930 by barrister Wilfred Greene, later Baron Greene of Holmbury St Mary in the County of Surrey. Only its outbuildings remain, a stable block and a pavilion. These are both Grade II listed buildings, designed by Webb. Modernist style house Greene commissioned Oliver Hill to design a new, modernist style house, completed in 1932. It was Hill's only modernist design before that of the Midland Hotel, Morecambe, Lancashire,Guise and Brook (2008), p. 17. which was completed in 1933.Guise and Brook (2008), p. 1. The house has a T-shaped plan, with the stem of the T to the rear of the house. One wing is forward-curving, while the other wing and the stem of the T terminate in loggias and terraces. At the centre of the front elevation there is a large, curved window around a stair-tower. The house is topped by a central drum, from which a succession of flat roofs step down. The curving front and central stair-tower window were ideas that recurred in Hill's design for the Midland Hotel.Guise and Brook (2008), pp. 20‚Äì21. In the years immediately following its construction, the house required repairs to its rendering and to leaking roofs, leading Greene to sue Hill for compensation. The architect Margaret Lubetkin n√©e Church was Greene's god daughter, and he consulted with Tecton, the modernist architectural practice led by her husband Berthold Lubetkin, intending to make alterations. Instead, he accepted Tecton's suggestion that another house could be built elsewhere in the grounds, for a similar cost. The Wilderness The new house was built against a south-facing slope in a part of the Joldwynds estate known as the wilderness garden, and became known as The Wilderness. This time, Greene insisted on a pitched roof. Anticipating the outbreak of World War II, he also required that the construction should be achievable by a local builder, using a collection of building materials that Greene stockpiled as a precaution against wartime shortages.Coe (1981), p. 177. The house was completed in 1939. Margaret Lubetkin was the principal designer. Unusually for Tecton, the design combined traditional with modernist elements. The house is largely of brick, with pitched slate roofs. In a more modern style, however, on the south, garden elevation there are concrete piers supporting balconies and a canopy. It is an early example of this kind of stylistic mixture. In media Joldwynds was used as a location for the TV drama Agatha Christie's Poirot in several episodes, including The Theft of the Royal Ruby and The Disappearance of Mr. Davenheim.

It originally aired on CBS in the United States on November 19, 2013. The episode is written by Christopher J. Wald and directed by Dennis Smith, and was seen by 19.66 million viewers.  Plot  During a briefing in the Multiple Threat Assessment Center (MTAC) by the Secretary of the Navy (SECNAV), network security detects an unauthorized electronic signal being broadcast, and the room is placed in lock down. While McGee sweeps the room, DiNozzo scans the four defense contractor representatives the SECNAV was briefing. Nothing is found until DiNozzo comes in close proximity to SECNAV, and his scanner goes off. A pen containing a covert listening device is found on SECNAV, but she cannot remember when or where the pen came from. As the investigation proceeds, DiNozzo finds a two-year-old National Security Agency (NSA) threat analysis report that describes the exact scenario of the security breach. Gibbs and DiNozzo visit the National Security Operations Center where they meet analyst Eleanor \\"Ellie\\" Bishop, the paper's author. Gibbs brings Bishop back to NCIS to assist in the investigation. SECNAV is contacted with a demand for $10 million for return of the intel that was recorded by the bug. She approves the payment and tasks the NSA with tracking the electronic funds transfer to catch the extortionist. Bishop's colleague at the NSA follows a lead to a coffee shop where the account was accessed from and is killed. Abby's forensics work on the bug from the pen leads to a license plate number for the suspected extortionist. Gibbs, DiNozzo and Bishop apprehend him and interrogate him to find he was working with someone else who extorted the government and killed the NSA agent. Gibbs' team tracks the killer to a private post office and are waiting to arrest him when Bishop arrives. Gibbs calls her to get her to get back in her car. As she tries to explain why she is there, the killer comes out of the post office surprising Bishop. The killer spots her NSA badge, pulls his gun and tries to subdue her. As Gibbs, DiNozzo and McGee rush to help Bishop, they find she has already wrestled the man to the ground and is holding his own gun on him. Investigating the killer further, Bishop determines that the killer was working for one of the defense contractors in the earlier briefing, who was trying to embarrass the SECNAV because she is a civilian who never served in uniform. Later Bishop meets privately with Gibbs and apologizes for not being a team player. Gibbs has pulled Bishop's application to NCIS she made before she started working at the NSA and offers her a joint duty assignment with NCIS.  Production  \\"Gut Check\\" is written by Christopher J. Wald and directed by Dennis Smith. As reported back in August 2013, a new character would be introduced as Ziva's replacement. \\"Casting intel\\" revealed her name to be \\"Bishop\\", with filming set to begin in mid-October. Bishop was described as a \\"twenty something female[;] bright, educated, athletic, attractive, fresh-faced, focused and somewhat socially awkward\\". In September Emily Wickersham was announced to play the role of Bishop, and was set to appear during \\"November sweeps\\". The initial deal included a three-episode arc, with a potential to become a regular. Two weeks prior to her introduction, Wickersham was made a regular. The press release listed her as a regular for the episode, but when the episode aired she was credited as \\"guest starring\\". Executive producer Gary Glasberg explained the reason behind choosing Wickersham to be because \\"We were seeing [...] moments and scenes and a connection with our characters that we all really responded to\\".  Reception  \\"Gut Check\\" was seen by 19.66 million live viewers at its November 19, 2013 broadcast, with a 3.0/9 share among adults aged 18 to 49. A rating point represents one percent of the total number of television sets in American households, and a share means the percentage of television sets in use tuned to the program. In total viewers, \\"Gut Check\\" was the highest rated show on the night it aired. Douglas Wolfe from TV Fanatic gave the episode 4.8/5 and stated that \\"The NCIS writers knocked this one out of the ball park, thanks to a story that introduced us to NSA Agent Eleanor \\"Ellie\\" Bishop.

The animal lived in the Upper Miocene and its fossils have been found in Spain. The animal was probably a terrestrial predator. The animal is about 60 centimeters long and its dentition is very otter-like. However, the animal does not appear to have been semi-aquatic. Its skeleton was slender and long-legged, unlike that of otters. These conflicting features suggest that the evolutionairy line of otters originated in the Miocene (or even the lower Oligocene) and that the dental morphology of otters developed before the other characteristics of the skeleton did.

Background The son of John Parkinson, by his wife Margaret Blackburne, he was born at Woodgates, Admarsh, near Lancaster, on 17 September 1797. He was educated at the grammar schools of Chipping, Hawkstead, and Sedbergh, and at St John's College, Cambridge, where he matriculated in December 1815. At Sedbergh he was the last pupil who studied mathematics under John Dawson, and at Cambridge his tutor was Thomas Calvert. He graduated B.A. in 1820, proceeding M.A. in 1824, B.D. in 1838, and D.D. on 10 December 1851. Career On leaving Cambridge in 1820, Parkinson was for a short time master of Lea School, near Preston.

His retention of the fellowship (and then canonry) of the collegiate church after his appointment in September 1846 as principal of St Bees Theological College, and incumbent of St Bees Priory, led to some bad feeling. He was a liberal donor to church objects, and gave towards the cost of rebuilding the vicarage- house and the old conventual abbey of St Bees. Grave of Canon Richard Parkinson, died 1858, at St Bees Priory, Cumbria. On 1 March 1857 Parkinson was seized with an attack of paralysis while in the pulpit of Manchester Cathedral.

This includes emergency care and critical time interventions offered across 2 hospital based settings, and one shelter for homeless persons with psychosocial disabilities, operated in collaboration with the Corporation of Chennai, reaching out to 162 individuals in distress at any given point of time. Over 3400 individuals have accessed these services since 1993. The Banyan's NALAM programme offers well-being oriented outpatient clinics and community based mental health care in both urban and rural areas. These clinics provide free of charge and mental health and social care services, address distress, common mental disorders and severe mental disorders. They are offered across 15 service access points, reaching out to a population of approximately 7 lakhs. NALAM has reached out to over 10,000 individuals and has a current active registry of 2000 individuals. For those who experience high support needs, The Banyan offers a range of inclusive living options, over 200 individuals with moderate to severe mental health issues, today live in communities & homelike environments with supportive services across 6 districts in 3 States (Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Maharashtra). The Banyan's sister organisation was founded in 2007. BALM uses capacity building, education programmes (diploma, masters‚Äô, and PhD programmes) in collaboration with the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), research, collaborative work (with civil society organisations, local governments, disability movements, mental health user-caregiver groups, and Central and State Government) and construction of think tanks, as strategies to influence progressive policies and plans. Chapters= Trichy Chapter  The Banyan's chapter in Trichy have built a programme that provides long- term care for 32 women through the Home Again approach.  Kerala Chapter  The Banyan's Kerala Chapter is led by Mr. Salih PM, a social worker and social entrepreneur who has been with The Banyan for over 10 years. He leads a team of 10 mental health professionals that run our Kerala Chapter, currently housing 22 residents through the Home Again programme. In Kerala, The Banyan is also working in collaboration with Tata Institute of Social Sciences, The Hans Foundation and The Government of Kerala on reorienting the social architecture of institutional mental health care. The project, known as \\"Snehakoodu\\" aims to identify long-stay patients in the government mental health centres in Trissur, Trivandrum and Calicut and facilitate their return to their homes or into inclusive living long-term care options, such as the Home Again program.  Maharashtra Chapter  The Banyan chapter in Maharashtra is a collaboration with Tata Institute of Social Sciences Field Action Programme and the Integrated Rural Health and Development Project, Tata Trusts and the Government of Maharashtra. The project entails the facilitation of exit pathways out of institutionalised care for persons who have been incarcerated within mental health facilities for extended periods of time.  Services = Emergency Care and Recovery Services  The Banyan rescues homeless individuals with mental illness through referrals and calls. They have 2 hospital based settings that service women and one shelter for homeless men with psychosocial needs run in collaboration with the corporation of Chennai. Combined, these locations serve around 150 individuals at a time. The Government of Tamil Nadu - National Health Mission plans to set up multiple new emergency care and recovery centres for individuals with mental illness, both those who are homeless and those who are not. The Banyan will act as capacity building partners on this project, and will also share the protocols and values of their emergency care and recovery services, so that they will be replicated in these new centres. = Reintegration & Aftercare = The Banyan works with police and local organisations to help their clients reconnect with their families after they have gotten better. They conduct home visits and educate family members on illness management prior to reintegrating the client. The aftercare programme ensures continuity of care after an individual has returned home. It functions through a coalition of civil society organisations, Government agencies, and individual functionaries (community health workers/peer advocates and activists) with capabilities to offer integrated mental health and social care interventions. Besides access to medical and psychological/counselling support, social care facilitation such as problem solving, work placement, access to social entitlements and local community support circles are also essential components of our aftercare programme.  NALAM: Wellbeing oriented outpatient care  The Banyan's NALAM programme is a well-being oriented, community based mental health care programme driven by grassroots workers who offer multi-tiered, multi- interventional packages of mental health care, that range from tracking progress on symptom reduction and securing economic stability, to pursuing personal aspirations. This programme exists across both rural and urban sites, servicing a population of over 1 million across 3 States (Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Maharashtra) and 6 districts through 17 mental health service access points. To date - 10,000 clients have accessed these services, and over 800 children access the youth clubs, pre-adolescent workshops, and tuition centres offered through this same programme. = NALAM Urban = NALAM Urban serves predominantly low-income areas in the Greater Chennai City Area and has cultivated a grassroots presence across all of the wards (Mogappair, Padi, Padiputhunagar, KK Nagar, Jafarkhanpet, West Saidapet, Choolaimedu, Santhome and Teynampet) it works in. The urban clinics are located in Chennai across these locations: * Loyola College (Nungambakkam) * The State Training and Resource Center (KK Nagar) * Stella Maris College (Cathedral Road) * Shelter for Homeless Men (Santhome) * Emergency Care and Recovery Center (Mogappair West) = NALAM Rural = NALAM Rural offers inpatient and outpatient programmes that address clinical and social care needs of individuals in need. The NALAM community mobilisers also engage in innovative mental health awareness programmes across local NGOs, youth groups, PHCs and MGNREGs sites. Outreach clinics are co-located with Government run spaces, such as the Government Primary Health Centre, and the Panchayat office. This is in an attempt to work alongside the Government machinery, and support the implementation of the Government District Mental Health Programme (DMHP). The rural clinics are located in Kanchipuram districts across these locations: *Kovalam *Sembakkam *Manampathy This approach will soon be replicated in collaboration with The Government of Tamil Nadu as a means to strengthen the District Mental Health Programme (DMHP)  Inclusive Living Options  For individuals who require long-term care, The Banyan offers supportive care inclusive living long term options. These programmes encourage social inclusion and currently almost 300 individuals are residing in these projects. = Clustered Group Homes = The Banyan's Clustered Group Home is a pseudo- institutional long-term care home. In it, about 50 women reside across 8 cottages, where women live, work and support one another while contributing to their home and space. In this setting support is provided to address complex long-term physical, psychological and economic needs of the clients. The women who live here spend their days pursuing work and vocational training as well as recreation and leisure activities of their choice. The Clustered Group Home is co-located with the BALM-TISS, a college that offers capacity building masters‚Äô, PhD and diploma programs in mental health. = Home Again = Home Again is a model of care, for individuals with mental illness who require long-term care that fosters choice based, inclusive living spaces through clustered or scattered homes in rural or urban neighbourhoods with a range of supportive services for people. Through this programme's model, individuals form affinity groups and live together in homes in a community. Together they create a shared space of comfort that mimics a familial environment. Every house of three to five women is staffed by a community worker who facilitates the psychosocial and medical intervention they continue to need and the women are encouraged to engage in a diverse range of work, and embrace leisure, recreation and socialization with the community. This programme is currently active in Tamil Nadu (Chennai, Kovalam & Trichy), Kerala (Mallapuram), and has been implemented in Assam through a partner organisation, Ashadeep. The Banyan is currently part of a collaborative project (along with Tata Institute of Social Sciences, The Hans Foundation and The Government of Kerala) in Kerala to facilitate exit options for long-stay patients in government run mental health centres. Many of the long-stay patients who will be identified through this project will be transferred to Home Again homes within Kerala.  Skills Development  At The Banyan, vocational training and work placement is offered across three verticals - arts & crafts (wire and jute products, carpentry, tailoring etc.), hospitality services (housekeeping, beauty services, laundry, waitstaff etc.), and healthcare (personal assistants, community based mental health workers, peer advocates, programme managers etc.) The organisation holds income enhancement and vocational independence as significant factors of importance when it comes to personal recovery. In addition to internal work placements and vocational training, The Banyan also has ties with external organisations to facilitate employment outside of the organisation. They also offer clients small and medium scale grants to federate social cooperatives. 60% of their clients are gainfully employed and productive in work.  Partnerships = Institutional Donors  The Banyan works with several longstanding partners who have enabled development of mental health solutions for those living with severe mental disorders, intensification of our engagement in mental health programs in low resource settings and in scaling up inclusive living options for those living with severe disability and persistent mental health issues. These include Tata Trusts, Azim Premji Philanthropic Initiatives, The Breadsticks Foundation, RF(I)T, Grand Challenges Canada, Paul Hamlyn Foundation, The Hans Foundation, HCL Foundation, BMW-Karl Monz and Oracle.  Government Partners  The Banyan is engaged with three State Governments (Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Maharashtra) towards revitalizing the paradigm of institutional mental health care. This program will includes scale up of three critical approaches developed by The Banyan - Home Again, Emergency Care and Recovery Services, and the NALAM approach. It will also implement feasible reintegration and aftercare options. Govt of Tamil Nadu: The Banyan in liaison with the Government of Tamil Nadu under the National Health Mission, has operationalised Emergency Care and Recovery Centres (ECRCs) across two districts (Vellore and Tirupur). These two centers have been functioning based on a value board drawn from The Banyan‚Äôs principles allowing for responsive, user-centric, and inclusive systems of mental health and sync in the vision of the state and national policies on mental health and disability. This apart we also plans for identifying and onboarding partners and experts for streamlining action. Govt of Kerala: Post the initial screening in three government mental hospitals in Kerala (Kozhikode, Thrissur and Trivandrum), the team has been working with an aftercare and reintegration focus. An Emergency Care and Recovery Center in coalition with the Government and the Devaswom has been operationalised in Guruvayur. Govt of Maharashtra: The Banyan is working with the Government of Maharashtra to transition 30 clients with long term needs from Ratnagiri and Thane Regional Mental Hospitals (RMHs) to commutable living settings in the form of Home Again. The Banyan is additionally engaged in a partnership with the Tata Institute of Social Sciences field action project, Integrated Rural and Human Development Project, in implementing a community mental health clinic for the Adivasi population in Aghai Panchayat and surrounding padas.  Awards*-+  The Banyan and its founders have acquired several accolades since 1993, including the Stree Shakthi Puraskar Award (Ministry of Women and Child Development) in 2003 G.D. Birla International Award in 2005, The Sat Paul Mittal National Award, 2007, AmeriCares Spirit of Humanity Awards, 2011, Swiss Foundation award with WHO in 2012 Sitaram Jindal Award, 2012, WHO Public Health Champion Award (India), 2017, and the University of Pennsylvania Nursing Renfield Foundation Award for Global Women's Health in 2018.

The company also built a Methodist church and a school. At the time, its location was a short distance outside the City of Glasgow, the largest town in Scotland; no trace now remains in the 21st century, with the site occupied by the now inner-city neighbourhood of Govanhill (the village was roughly located at Bankhall Street at the Govanhill Picture House.) History The Govan Colliery, also known as the Little Govan Colliery, was worked from at least the 18th Century, William DixonMacLehose,p103 having started there as colliery manager in the 1770s. The colliery and later the iron works remained in the control of the Dixon family from then until 1873 when it became a limited company, William Dixon Ltd., and was no longer a family firm. Between 1783 and 1785 the Govan Waggonway was built between the colliery and the River Clyde to the north.George Dott, Early Scottish Wagonways, St Margaret's Technical Press Limited, London, 1947Industrial Revolution: 1770s to 1830s: Neighbourhoods: Little Govan, The Glasgow Story In 1811, Dixons built a waggonway linking the colliery with the Glasgow, Paisley and Johnstone Canal at Port Eglinton, the Glasgow terminus. The canal was opened in 1810. In 1820, Dixons bought the lands of Govanhill and the colliery. In 1830, an Act of Parliament authorized the construction of the Polloc and Govan Railway(sic) which was completed in 1840. It extended the old tramway past Port Eglinton to Windmill Quay on the Clyde in one direction and to Rutherglen in the other direction.Records of the Poloc and Govan Railway The line now forms part of the West Coast Main Line. In the 1860s the first tenements were built, which later formed the Burgh of Govanhill. The houses belonging to Fireworks were gradually demolished. In 1906, Garden Square, the last of the old Fireworks Village, was demolished. Geography The village lay about south of Glasgow City Chambers, just to the north of the junction of the turnpike between Glasgow and Carmunnock via Cathcart (now Cathcart Road) and the Rutherglen to Paisley road (now Allison Street).OS Six- inch 1st edition, 1843-1882, Explore georeferenced maps (National Library of Scotland) What is now Bankhall Street lies in the middle of the old village, which consisted of Hosie's Land and Garden Square to the west of the turnpike and Engine Row, the Back Close, Carter Row, the Cuddy Row and Graham Square to the east.

Although later celebrated for its softly feminist depictions of a woman's sexual freedom, her work suffered heavy criticism at the time of publication for subverting contemporary gender norms. Introduction Before their publication as a collection, Yosano's 399 poems were written as a diary of the imagery and inner workings of her life during the time of her sexual awakening and courtship. Each poem presented a vivid picture of a lively, free woman who did not wait for others to decide whom she could love. She possessed an independent sexuality and sought out love on her own time and her own terms, rather than waiting for a man to come to her. Yosano emphasized the beauty of her female subject by descriptions of breasts, skin, lips, shoulders, and black hair. The young woman inhabits an unconventionally self-centered world, and is first encountered combing her long, luxurious black hair, welcoming the morning with triumphant passion. :Sono ko hatachi kushi ni nagaruru kurokami no ogori no haru no utsukushiki kana :That child of 20, a comb in the waves of her black hair, takes pride in the beauty of her spring. This hair later on becomes tangled with sin, in which the now anguished woman wanders like a lost lamb. She turns to the sutras and Buddha for redemption, but eventually, tangled hair and all, the young woman is able to hold onto her love without the help of religion. Influences and Symbolism Midaregami is first of all a diary, influenced by the poet's encounter with Tekkan Yosano, her eventual husband. Of the 399 poems, 385 of them are of her love for Tekkan, of which the initial love affair (Tekkan had a common law wife at the time) and elopement are present within the poems. Although inspired by real life, many references to Japan's artistic and literary heritage are also present. Midaregami often depicts the image of the heroine Ukifune from the classic The Tale of Genji, which Yosano had read avidly during her youth. Many of the poems also use the same expressions as those found within The Tale of Genji, and use the imagery of hair to express a character‚Äôs fortunes and inner feelings. :kurogami no sensuji no kami no midare kami katsu omoi midare omoi midareru :black hair‚Äôs thousand strains, tangled hair and tangled feelings Long black hair appears in classical literary works to symbolize the nobility, beauty, grace, and sexuality of women. Breasts, lips, skin, and shoulders are used as a symbol for the independent beauty and strength of the young woman. At one point the image of a sheep is taken as a metaphor for the young woman losing her way. Throughout the collection there are many words which have religious undertones in Buddhism, and the sutras are directly referenced in one poem. Cultural impact Midaregami challenged the feudal view of women as those responsible for the production of children and the management of the family's domestic life. During the early twentieth century, the current status of women in Japan was described by the phrase, ‚ÄúOnna sankai ni ie nashi‚Äù (Women have no home in their three lives), which meant that the actions of women in their expected roles as daughter, housewife, and mother were controlled by the patriarchal trinity of father, husband, and son. Yosano's poems turned the symbolic reference of the female body from motherhood and child-feeding to an expression of natural beauty, especially for young women. Midaregami also subverted the contemporary norms of feminine modesty and sexual secrecy. The subject of her poems openly and freely expresses her sexual desire to her lover. :yawa hada no atsuki chishio ni fure mo mi de sabishikarazuya michi o toku kimi :Not even once have you touched my soft flesh, coursing hot blood. Don't you feel a bit lonesome, you‚Äìalways preaching your way? Because of these explicit admissions and the radical departure from cultural norms, critics of the time denounced Yosano and her work. However, the collection served as an inspiration for women during the early twentieth century, at a time when Japanese feminists were beginning to make their positions known.

Early developments There was a transient biochemical pregnancy reported by Australian Foxton School researchers in 1953. John Rock was the first to extract an intact fertilized egg. In 1959, Min Chueh Chang at the Worcester Foundation, proved fertilisation in vitro was capable of proceeding to a birth of a live rabbit. Chang's discovery was seminal, as it clearly demonstrated that oocytes fertilised in vitro were capable of developing, if transferred into the uterus and thereby produce live young. Early, non-viable pregnancies The first pregnancy achieved through in vitro human fertilisation of a human oocyte was reported in The Lancet from the Monash University team of Carl Wood, John Leeton and Alan TrounsonHistory Of IVF. monashivf.com in 1973, although it lasted only a few days and would today be called a biochemical pregnancy.

Retrieved on 3 August 2013.Henig, Robin Marantz. (28 December 2003) THE LIVES THEY LIVED; Second Best. New York Times. There was also an ectopic pregnancy reported by Patrick Steptoe and Robert Edwards in 1976. First baby In 1977, Steptoe and Edwards successfully carried out a pioneering conception which resulted in the birth of the world's first baby to be conceived by IVF, Louise Brown on 25 July 1978, in Oldham General Hospital, Greater Manchester, UK.Schulman, Joseph D. (2010) Robert G. Edwards ‚Äì A Personal Viewpoint, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, . Second baby In October 1978, it was reported that Subash Mukhopadyay, a physician from Kolkata, India was performing experiments on his own with primitive instruments and a household refrigerator and this resulted in a test tube baby, later named as \\"Durga\\" (alias Kanupriya Agarwal) who was born on 3 October 1978.The New Scientist, 18 October 1978, page 158 However, state authorities prevented him from presenting his work at scientific conferences and, in the absence of scientific evidence, his work is not recognised by the international scientific community. These days, however, Mukhopadhyay's contribution is acknowledged in works dealing with the subject.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkEko0DybuQ First boy and transformation from pure research to treatment Steptoe and Edwards were responsible for the world's first confirmed boy conceived by IVF, Alastair MacDonald born on 14 January 1979 in Glasgow.The Daily Telegraph, London, 15 January 1979, page 1 A team led by Ian Johnston and Alex Lopata were responsible for Australia's first baby conceived by IVF, Candice Reed, born on 23 June 1980 in Melbourne.The Times, London, 24 June 1980, page 7 It was the subsequent use of stimulated cycles with clomiphene citrate and the use of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) to control and time oocyte maturation, thus controlling the time of collection, that converted IVF from a research tool to a clinical treatment. This was followed by a total of 14 pregnancies resulting in nine births in 1981 with the Monash University team. Howard W. Jones and Georgeanna Seegar Jones at the Eastern Virginia Medical School in Norfolk, Virginia, further improved stimulated cycles by incorporating the use of a follicle-stimulating hormone (uHMG). This then became known as controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH). Another step forward was the use of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHA), thus decreasing the need for monitoring by preventing premature ovulation, and more recently gonadotrophin- releasing hormone antagonists (GnRH Ant), which have a similar function. The additional use of the oral contraceptive pill has allowed the scheduling of IVF cycles, which has made the treatment far more convenient for both staff and patients. Subsequent refinements The ability to freeze and subsequently thaw and transfer embryos has significantly improved the feasibility of IVF use. The other very significant milestone in IVF was the development of the intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) of single sperms by Gianpiero D. Palermo et al.in Brussels (UZ Brussel), 1992.Pregnancies after intracytoplasmic injection of single spermatozoon into an oocyte. G Palermo, H Joris, P Devroey, AC Van Steirteghem - Lancet, 1992 This has enabled men with minimal sperm production to achieve pregnancies. ICSI is sometimes used in conjunction with sperm recovery, using a testicular fine needle or open testicular biopsy. Using this method, some men with Klinefelter's syndrome, and so would be otherwise infertile, have occasionally been able to achieve pregnancy. Thus, IVF has become the final solution for most fertility problems, moving from tubal disease to male factor, idiopathic subfertility, endometriosis, advanced maternal age, and anovulation not responding to ovulation induction. Recognition Robert Edwards was awarded the 2010 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \\"for the development of in vitro fertilization\\". Steptoe and Jean Purdy were not eligible for consideration as the Nobel Prize is not awarded posthumously.

A much larger version of the caravel, its use was most notorious beginning in the end of that century. The square-rigged caravel held a notable role in the Portuguese expansion during the age of discovery, especially in the first half of the sixteenth century, for its exceptional maneuverability and combat capabilities. This ship was also sometimes adopted by other European powers. The hull was galleon-shaped, and some experts consider this vessel a forerunner of the fighting galleon, by the name of '. History Two square-rigged caravels (detail) 4th Portuguese India Armada of 1502 (Livro de Lisuarte de Abreu) Square-rigged caravel () The Portuguese square-rigged caravel or round caravel appeared more frequently in the end of the fifteenth century and especially in the beginning of the sixteenth century. Traditionally considered a particular type of the caravel, but also a new and different type of ship due to its significant structural differences, was the result of an evolution in design of the caravel (lateen caravel) and a structural combination between the carrack and the same caravel, but distinct, however, from both. Christopher Columbus, on his voyages to the New World in the service of Castile, used ships also called (round caravels) by the combination of sails (Possibly in based lateen caravels and other traditional ships models), they were however different from the Portuguese models, which differed by the number and arrangement of the sails and by the hull shape, among other features. There were regulations for the construction of caravels of 150 to 180 tons, 110 to 150 tons, and from 100 to 125 tons. Square-rigged caravels and lateen caravels were different types of ships, being only the generic name caravel the greatest link between both. The square-rigged caravel possessed aftercastle and forecastle, unlike the lateen caravel, which could not have any structure erected on the bow of the ship, because of the maneuver of the foremast. From this point of view, the square-rigged caravel was closer to the naus and galleons than to its lateen caravel counterpart. She also had a beak apparently quite innovative (for its time) or of \\"modern\\" style, projecting forward from the bow below the level of the forecastle, somewhat similar to that commonly used later in galleons of the second half of the 16th century. She had taper and narrow hull lines, checking that the relationship between length and width was between 3:1 and 4:1 (some rare, possibly longer), walking roughly in the middle. This relationship goes close to the patache, ship of some similar characteristics, and was slightly higher than the 3:1 ratio stipulated by the regulations for ships of 150 tons.BARATA, Jo√£o da Gama Pimentel, Estudos de Arqueologia Naval, vols. I e II, Lisboa, Imprensa Nacional-Casa da Moeda, 1989. If the Portuguese galleon, largely designed for better navigation and for naval defense, would be of more mixed use, warfare and transportation, as would also be the Spanish galleon (among other European ships of this \\"class\\" or similar style), the square-rigged caravel or , though partly bifunctional, was essentially dedicated to naval warfare and for the defense of armadas. The use of these square-rigged caravels for exploration reconnaissance and combat (if necessary), following a larger number of naus in each fleet, were instrumental in the exploration of North America, South America the East, and particularly in the Portuguese India Armadas - including the discovery of Brazil - from the expedition of Pedro √Ålvares Cabral in 1500 and continuing in the fleets that followed. They were also important, along with naus, in decisive historic battles, as Diu. The square-rigged caravels had optimal use in coast guard armadas, in the Strait of Gibraltar, Atlantic Islands, North Africa, Mediterranean, Brazil and Indian Ocean. When D. Manuel I decided to send ships to the Azores in order to protect the ships from India, or when he created the (\\"Strait Armada\\"), he did so with square-rigged caravels armed for naval military action, also some naus, and later on, galleons (in the North Atlantic); and in the Strait of Gibraltar, joining them to the fustas and galleys. Despite the round caravel has been partially replaced by the galleon, its great qualities allowed its use until the end of the seventeenth century. The Portuguese Man o' War was named after this curious type of fighting ship. Design Having been a combination of the carrack and the caravel, the square-rigged caravel was distinguished clearly from both ships by its combined sails (absent in the caravel), with four or more masts, usually three with lateen rigged sails and the fore-mast with two square sails, and by its hull design which was narrower and longer. The square-rigged caravel was proportionally narrower in width and longer than the caravel, distinguished also by the sterncastle, more elongated and usually more projected backwards, and more complex, in two floors or two-deck castle- like, on diagonal gradation in length. It was also distinguished from the caravel by the existence of a lower forecastle and by having a snout or head - a long beak, projecting forward from the bow below the level of the forecastle (both absent in the lateen caravel). The configuration of the square-rigged caravel obeyed to round ships, generally having a more narrow and elongated hull than the vessels of bigger size, more lower lines, aftercastle and forecastle, with two or one floors, and two covers. The ship had four masts, one with two square-rigged sails (the foremast) and lateen sails on the other ones; perfectly adequate morphology tonnage according to the general evolution of sailing vessels since the fifteenth century, which saw firstly a large increase in its superstructures, and came gradually to decrease in volume. Square-rigged caravels fighting and escorting naus in India Armadas Caravela de Armada The \\"caravela de armada\\" was, fundamentally, a well-armed square- rigged caravel, created out of the need to carry more cargo and heavier artillery, so as to fulfill military duties such as convoy escort or coastal patrol and integrate the Portuguese Armadas, particularly in the sixteenth century. In order to keep the center of gravity low, so as not to compromise the stability, the draught of the ship was increased, thus enabling the existence of several decks. Galleon Portuguese naus, galleon, small square-rigged caravel, galiots (fustas) and galleys - Portuguese Armada in Suakin, present day Sudan - 1541, from the Routemap of the Red Sea by Jo√£o de Castro, during the Portuguese expedition to Suez - Egypt, in 1540-1541. The Portuguese galleon probably arose during the first quarter of the sixteenth century, contributing to the hegemony of Portugal in the East. It was a havily armed and robust, with less cargo capacity than the carracks used to transport goods, but proved especially suitable to escort fleets and convoys, namely in the India run. This ship was a forerunner and a pioneer in its kind, including in the number and arrangement of its sails, and in its shape as a whole. In structural terms the galleon may constitute an evolution (in part) of the square-rigged caravel, although wider and heavier. The galleon had a lower and discrete forecastle and a narrower and taper hull than the nau, as the square- rigged caravel, which is substantiated by the higher relation between the length and the bow. Both characteristics, allied to a powerful weaponry and more hydrodynamic lines, made the galleon, in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the Portuguese warship par excellence. Moreover, its hull had a higher density of beacons and stringers, which made the structure more solid and, above all, more resistant to naval artillery.O gale√£o portugu√™s (1519-1625) BARATA, Jo√£o da Gama Pimentel, in Estudos de Arqueologia Naval, vol. I, Lisboa, IN-CM, 1989 pp. 54, (pp. 303-326).O Gale√£o Initially, the Portuguese galleon had long beaks and spurs, and operated with three masts, the foremast and the main-mast with two square-rigged sails each, and a lateen rigged sail in the mizzen-mast. Result of the natural evolution of new requirements raised by war, soon they were built with four masts; the larger vessels had this configuration, always with lateen rigged sails in the two mizzen-masts in almost all galleons, and a third square smaller sail at the tops of the fore-mast and the main-mast (the latter in larger ships), which can be seen in the galleon S√£o Jo√£o Baptista, the Botafogo, and on the galleons illustrated in the Roteiro do Mar Roxo of D. Jo√£o de Castro. The galleon was so, also, a combination of the carrack and the square-rigged caravel in its sails. Another detail which differs in the galleon is the presence of a beak of appreciable size, extending forward horizontally at the wheel of the bow. This feature, which could already be detected on the square- rigged caravel, appears to be evidence of greater effort required of the bowsprit, which will not be unaware of the fact that both the height of the mast as the sail surface had grown over time. On the other hand, the more lower and narrower lines, the tapered and pointy shape of the hull, and the beak-shaped prow, allow the navigators to achieve greater speed, while the lower height of the forecastle gave her manoeuver qualities, including greater ability to navigate at a more bushy bowline, with advantage to maneuver on confined spaces. The great firepower of these ships tended to unbalance in their favor the outcome of battles fought at sea, having been used in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans.

It was started as free and open-source software by Roman Birg based on the official releases of Android Open Source Project by Google, with added original and third-party code, features, and control. Although only a portion of the total AOKP users elect to report their use of the firmware, as of September 2013, it is used by more than 3.5 million devices across the world. Features AOKP allows users to change many aspects of the OS including its appearance and its functions. It allows customizations normally not permitted by the factory firmware. * LED control: The color and pulsing of the notification LED can be custom set for various applications. * Navigation ring: Actions can be assigned to the navigation ring, to allow for quicker access applications. * Ribbon: Allows users to use swipe gestures anywhere and enables a system-wide custom application shortcuts and actions. * Vibration patterns: Users can build custom vibration patterns to be assigned to notifications from certain applications or calls from certain people. * Native theme support: Themes, downloaded from the Google Play Store or from other sources, can be applied to give a modified appearance to the device interface. AOKP now features Substratum support. * Customization of the hardware and software buttons, including track skip/flashlight while the screen is off, PIE control and the ROM's unique Fling navigation system * UI control, including colour strokes and background blue * Status bar customization, such as battery icon stylization and network activity * Power menu customization * Notification and quick settings configurations, such as how many toggles are displayed on the quick settings header at a time Release versions AOKP builds/releases are provided on a milestone and nightly schedule: Milestones: Most stable builds which are usually released once a month. However, milestone builds have not been released for several years and the AOKP team appears to just release nightlies as of Nougat builds. Nightlies: Automatic builds every 3 days with the latest code committed but may contain bugs To be notified of new releases, users can get the AOKPush application that uses the Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) service provided by Google to immediately receive push notifications when a build is complete and ready to download. With AOKPush, users also get the available test builds and random messages from the developer team. GCM is integrated into the Android framework so the application does not wake up the device periodically to fetch data nor use extra battery. There are also devices that would rely on AOKP to get latest android update. Firmware history and development Not long after the introduction of the HTC Dream (named the \\"T-Mobile G1\\" in the United States) mobile phone in September 2008, a method was discovered to attain privileged control (termed \\"root access\\") within Android's Linux-based subsystem. Having root access, combined with the open source nature of the Android operating system, allowed the phone's stock firmware to be modified and re-installed onto the phone. In the following years, several modified firmware releases for mobile devices were developed and distributed by Android enthusiasts. One, maintained by a developer named Roman Birg of AOKP, quickly became popular among several high-end Android mobile owners. AOKP started in November 2011 and quickly grew in popularity, forming a small community of developers called the AOKP Team (also known as \\"Team Kang\\"). Within a few months, the number of devices and features supported by AOKP escalated, and AOKP quickly became the second most popular Android firmware distributions, CyanogenMod being the first. AOKP is developed using a distributed revision control system with the official repositories hosted on GitHub like many other open source projects. New features or bug fix changes made by contributors are submitted using Google's source code review system, Gerrit. Contributions may be tested by anyone, voted up or down by registered users, and ultimately accepted into the code by AOKP developers. In early 2020 AOKP Developers posted a blog outlining parity with LineageOS upstream. \\"Device support will be a bit different this time around. We can support any device that is getting Lineage 16.0 builds.

It serves to connect the community of Cordesville with the surrounding highways. Route description SC 402 is a two-lane rural road that begins at U.S. Route 52 (US 52) and U.S. Route 17 Alternate (US 17 Alt.) near Moncks Corner; per the South Carolina Department of Transportation, SC 402 ends at the pair of U.S. Highways though signage on US 52/US 17 Alt direct travelers \\"to\\" SC 402. From there, it goes east, through Cordesville and by the Huger Recreational Area. At Huger, it ends at SC 41\\\\. Because it traverses mostly in or along Francis Marion National Forest, majority of the route is forested. History Originally established in 1928, it traversed from US 17 near Moncks Corner to SC 40 near Whitehall Terrace. In 1939, SC 402's eastern terminus was truncated at Huger; its former routing to Whitehall Terrace replaced partly by SC 511 and the remainder becoming secondary roads: United Drive (S-8-598) and Guerins Bridge Road (S-10-98). In 1948, what remained of SC 402 was downgraded to a secondary road. In 1951 or 1952, it was re-established along the same routing now from US 52/US 17 Alt. split near Moncks Corner to SC 41 in Huger. In the late 1980s, SC 402 was removed from the US 52/US 17 Alt split; truncated south from the split to a connector road to US 52/US 17 Alt. It was officially extended to the pair of highways at an unknown date.

The shell is fusiform in profile, reaching maximum width at or near the base of body chamber, which narrows toward the aperture. The siphuncle is large and slightly removed from the ventral side, that with the concave longitudinal profile. Siphuncle segments are short, as are chambers; septal necks recurved, connecting rings thick, bullettes at the apical end of the rings swollen. Cameral deposits are lacking. Cyrtogomphoceras seems to be derived from Strandoceras by a reduction in the degree of endogastric curvature and may have given rise to Landeroceras by a further evolutionary straightening of the shell. Cyrtogomphoceras, named by Foeste, 1924, has been found in middle and upper Ordovician beds in North America and Greenland. Fossils identified as such have also been found in the Silurian of Estonia. The type species is Oncoceras magnun Whiteaves 1890.

Originally the site of several mansions dating back to 1348, Burnt Stub Mansion was a private feature for years, before opening as Hocus Pocus Hall in 2003. It closed in 2018 to be redeveloped as Room On The Broom: A Magical Journey. History View of the mansion. Burnt Stub Mansion The mansion at Chessington World of Adventures Resort, today called Burnt Stub was built in 1348 in Chessington. In the English Civil War it became a royalist stronghold, later being razed by Oliver Cromwell's Parliamentary forces giving it its modern name. Hocus Pocus Hall description A gremlin outside the attraction Hocus Pocus Hall is a 4-D walk through attraction that leads throughout the mansion, with no age restriction. Theming includes animatronics such as a wizard and goblins, as well as rotating hallways and 3D paintings, for which 3-D glasses could be worn until the 2017 season where these were removed. The attraction would begin inside the main hall of the building where you were greeted by a preshow involving a wizard and the troublesome goblins of the Hall before the room transformed before your eyes into a room full of goblins and eyes from every corner - the bookcase would move aside leading you through a library corridor and into a trommel tunnel. After the tunnel you reach a generator room where goblins are causing all kinds of chaos in the form of animatronic statues and peppers ghost style projections. Guests throughout the scene are challenged to interact with buttons and pressure pads, even putting their hands in holes for a surprise or two. Guests were then led across pressure pads in what looked like a garden scene before reaching the ‚Äúfarting chair‚Äù - a chair which farted when someone was to sit on it. The next scene was the wizards bedroom where guests witnessed the goblins interacting around the sleeping wizard. The floors were then uneven as the attraction approached the finale, the mirror maze. The maze also included a drop off point for the 3D glasses until their removal. The mirror maze themed around a garden hid a few surprises as guests would get more and more lost whilst being surprised by goblins appearing through the glass. The attraction ends at the end of the mirror maze just to the right of the manors entrance. During the park's 2013 Halloween event, the attraction had a makeover as ‚ÄúThe Mystery of Hocus Pocus Hall‚Äù, featuring a new theme overlay and soundtrack. It was announced in October 2018 that Hocus Pocus Hall would be redeveloped as Room On The Broom, based on the children's book by Julia Donaldson.

Description Phyllodoce caerulea is a low shrub, typically growing high, and exceptionally reaching . Its evergreen leaves are long and wide, and are borne on long petioles; they are arranged alternately. The flowers are borne in clusters of 2‚Äì6; each flower is long, with a corolla composed of five fused petals that begin purple, but fade to a bluish pink. These are surrounded by five sepals, and themselves surround the 8‚Äì10 free stamens and a superior ovary that produces nectar at its base. Distribution Phyllodoce caerulea has a patchy circumboreal distribution, with gaps between 110¬∞ W and 155¬∞ W and between 70¬∞ E and 125¬∞ E. The Sow of Atholl from the north, including the site where P. caerulea was first discovered in the British Isles, in 1810. In Europe, P. caerulea is found from Iceland to the Kanin Peninsula. Its Icelandic distribution is also disjunct, comprising the area around Eyjafj√∂r√∞ur and a site near Desjarmyri. In the British Isles, P. caerulea is confined to a few sites in the Scottish Highlands. It was first discovered around a spring at an altitude of on the slopes of the Sow of Atholl, but has since been found at a few sites in the Ben Alder forest. It became a protected species in the UK in 1975 under the Conservation of Wild Creatures and Wild Plants Act.http://www.caithness.org/caithnessfieldclub/bulletins/1975/october/conservation.htm There are reports of the plant's occurrence in the Swiss Alps, but no herbarium specimens have been found to confirm this. The species has not been observed on the Faroe Islands, Jan Mayen, Bj√∏rn√∏ya, Svalbard or Franz Josef Land. In Asia, Phyllodoce caerulea occurs in the Ural Mountains, around Lake Baikal and in the Mongolian Khangai and Kentii mountains, but is absent from most of central Siberia. It occurs on Hokkaido, Sakhalin, the Kamchatka Peninsula and in Beringia. In North America, P. caerulea is found in coastal Alaska, the Northwest Territories, Quebec and Labrador, as well as scattered sites in the Gasp√© Peninsula and the White Mountains of New Hampshire and Vermont. It is widespread and common in Greenland. Its absence from the Yukon has been described as \\"surprising\\". Taxonomy Phyllodoce caerulea was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1753 ', as a species in the genus Andromeda. It was transferred to the genus Phyllodoce by Cardale Babington in his 1843 Manual of British Botany. In Japan, P. caerulea hybridises with the pale yellowish-flowering species P. aleutica to produce F1 offspring with flowers that are pink, orange or striped in pink and yellowish white.

He produced the first English translation of the Universal Natural History and Theory of Heaven, by Immanuel Kant. Hastie led the General Assembly's Institution in Calcutta, where he was credited with developing the Hindu advocate Swami Vivekananda. Hastie recovered from a ruinous libel case in Calcutta to become the Professor of Divinity at University of Glasgow. Early life and career William Hastie was born on 7 July 1842 at Wanlockhead in Dumfriesshire, Scotland. He entered the University of Edinburgh in 1859 and graduated with an M.A. in Philosophy in the First Division in 1867 and further with a B.D. in 1869.General Assembly's Institution (1845‚Äì1907): Principals in 175th Year Commemoration Volume. Scottish Church College, April 2008, p. 568. He further studied at the University of Glasgow in 1870 and 1871, under John Caird, Professor of Divinity. Hastie studied further in the Netherlands and Germany and became fluent in German. In 1875, he decided to become a probationer in the Church of Scotland so that he could teach abroad. Three years later, he was on a ship bound from Liverpool to Calcutta. India In 1878 Hastie was appointed principal of the General Assembly's Institution in Calcutta. According to a legend, Narendranath Datta (the future Swami Vivekananda) was first introduced to Indian mystic Ramakrishna in a literature class, given by Hastie. While lecturing on William Wordsworth's poem, The Excursion, Hastie suggested to his students that they should visit Ramakrishna of Dakshineswar to understand the true meaning of the phenomenon of \\"trance\\". Rajagopal Chattopadhyaya attributes the legend to a classmate of Narendranath, Haramohan Mitra. Hastie must have inspired his students, because several went on to find out more about meditation. Hastie showed an interest in his students. For instance, despite Narendranath Datta's chain-smoking, he remarked, \\"Narendra Nath Dutta is really a genius. I have traveled far and wide, but have never yet come across a lad of his talent and possibilities, even in the German universities amongst philosophy students\\". Hastie was ambitious, planning to build his own mission centre, but he fell out with his own employer's missionaries. When this became public knowledge, the missionaries were the ones supported in their complaints. Hastie then published an ill-timed collection of his letters under the title \\"Hindu Idolatry and the Enlightened Englishmen\\", which annoyed the Hindu community and caused someone to assault him. Hastie was described as a stubborn idealist and his discussions and objections to blind faith, bigotry, and rituals were not well received. His objections to rituals were taken up by Bankim Chatterjee and became a public argument. Libel charge and imprisonment In parallel with his other troubles, Hastie fell out with a Miss Pigot who was employed by the Scottish Ladies Association. One source claims that it was Hastie who was trying to expose the poor management and morals of Pigot of the Zenana Mission School and Orphanage. Hastie claimed that the (allegedly) Eurasian Pigot was illegitimate and she was having an affair both with a native Christian teacher at the Free Church college and a Professor Wilson at his college. Hastie and Pigot both went to court, with Hastie defending himself on libel charges by calling on supportive witnesses. The case was sent to appeal, and eventually Hastie and his witnesses were rebuked. He unsuccessfully appealed to the church in Scotland. He had already been dismissed in 1884 and had no way of covering the fine and costs that the court levied against him. As a result, Hastie was imprisoned in Calcutta in 1885 and was released only when he went bankrupt.H. C. G. Matthew, 'Hastie, William (1842‚Äì1903)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 27 Nov 2013 Contemporary commentators have put the case down to Hastie's sexual jealousy, as he suspected one of Pigot's partners - Kalicharan Bannerjee - of writing articles that disagreed with Hastie's theology. The case has been studied by Professor Kenneth Ballhatchet in his book on race, sex, and class. The secular Indian and the English Press sided with Miss Pigot, but the Indian missionary establishment's views were summarised by Rev. J. Hudson in the \\"Harvest Field\\", where he discussed the case and concluded that Pigot was not immoral but \\"lacking in female delicacy\\". Hudson interwove this observation with hints of Pigot's poor management. Later analysis sees Hastie as a \\"classic case of sexual jealousy\\" being projected from his intellectual rivalry onto sexual rivalry. Hastie returned to Wanlockhead in 1885 to work as a translator. Final years In 1892 Hastie was chosen to deliver the Croall Lectures at the University of Edinburgh. The University also awarded him the honorary degree of DD on 13 April 1894. In 1895, Hastie succeeded William Purdie Dickson as the professor of divinity at University of Glasgow. In 1900 he produced the first English translation of the Allgemeine Naturgeschichte und Theorie des Himmels by Immanuel Kant. Hastie described the work \\"as the most wonderful and enduring product of [Kant's] genius.\\" Hastie died in Edinburgh on 31 August 1903 and was buried in his hometown.

History In 1913, the state of Michigan authorized the designation of a state trunkline system, stipulating that the Michigan State Highway Department would build and maintain bridges of or more on trunk line routes. Soon after, a trunkline route across Presque Isle County was designated, with most of the road improvements completed by 1915. However, it was not until 1919 that the Michigan State Highway Department began work on designing this bridge, designated Trunk Line Bridge No. 253. Bids were solicited, and eventually Rogers City contractor John Decker was awarded an $8,849 contract to construct this bridge. Work was completed in 1920. This section of the trunkline was later incorporated into US-23 and M-68. In 1954, the main highway was rerouted over another bridge, but this one continued to carry local traffic.

A pair of yoked bulls are sent charging down a football field-sized paddy field soaked in ankle deep water, while their handlers boarded on a wooden plank, hang onto the tail or onto a harness and slide through the mud. The fields are freshly ploughed as the bulls are raced by their handlers. Bull surfing competitions are common in Kerala where local clubs or landlords offer trophies and cash prizes for races with different categories for speed and style. A pair of oxen is usually managed by a participating unit formed by a handler (the surfing member) and a team of people to assist him. Usually 30 to 50 of these units participate in the race that goes on from morning until dusk. Just like the professional jockeys, these participants are well trained and are experts in managing the oxen during the race. The oxen are specifically fed and trained just for the competition. They are also well groomed and horn polished, so they look their best before jumping in the mud. Most participants begin by holding onto the rope attached to the bulls, and move to hang onto the tail when their surfing begins. The races are performed by one team at a time and there will be several rounds to determine which team took the least time to complete one lap within the field. The villagers gather around these fields while keeping a safe distance and chanting and cheering in excitement.

It is native to the coasts of southeastern Australia where it is found on reefs, in estuaries and bays at depths down to about . Description The passion flower feather star is a robust crinoid with a diameter of about when fully extended. It has eighteen to twenty jointed arms which can be coiled up when the animal is not feeding. These are attached to a cup-shaped body or calyx. The arms are edged by feathery appendages known as pinnules. Each pinnule has rows of tube feet on either side of a central ambulacral groove lined with cilia. This groove is continuous with the central groove on the arm which leads to the mouth at the centre of the calyx. The aboral (lower) surface of the crinoid has a number of hooked appendages called cirri which grip onto the substrate, which may be a rock, a sponge, a coral or sea fan. The colour of this crinoid is usually some shade of red. Distribution and habitat The passion flower feather star is native to the coasts of southeastern Australia down to depths of about . Its range extends from Masthead Island in Queensland and the mouth of the Clarence River in New South Wales to Port Philip Bay in Victoria. It is found on rocks and rubble in sheltered bays, in estuaries and on reefs. Biology The passion flower feather star is a filter feeder. It catches plankton and suspended particles of detritus with the tube feet on the pinnules. These feet are covered with sticky mucus that traps the food particles and then roll it into balls before moving them into the ambulacral groove, where cilia propel the stream of mucus towards the mouth.

While wellness tourism is often correlated with medical tourism because health interests motivate the traveler, wellness tourists are proactive in seeking to improve or maintain health and quality of life, often focusing on prevention, while medical tourists generally travel reactively to receive treatment for a diagnosed disease or condition. Market Within the US $3.4 trillion spa and wellness economy, wellness tourism is estimated to total US$494 billion or 14.6 percent of all 2013 domestic and international tourism expenditures. Driven by growth in Asia, the Middle East/North Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa and developing countries, wellness tourism is expected to grow 50 percent faster than the overall tourism industry over the next five years. Market is expected to grow through 2014. Wellness tourists are generally high-yield tourists, spending, on average, 130 percent more than the average tourist. In 2013, International wellness tourists spend approximately 59 percent more per trip than the average international tourist; domestic wellness tourists spend about 159 percent more than the average domestic tourist. Domestic wellness tourism is significantly larger than its international equivalent, representing 84 percent of wellness travel and 68 percent of expenditures (or $299 billion). International wellness tourism represents 16 percent of wellness travel and 32 percent of expenditures ($139 billion market). The wellness tourism market includes primary and secondary wellness tourists. Primary wellness tourists travel entirely for wellness purposes while secondary wellness tourists engage in wellness-related activities as part of a trip. Secondary wellness tourists constitute the significant majority (87 percent) of total wellness tourism trips and expenditures (85 percent). Types Wellness travelers pursue diverse services, including physical fitness and sports; beauty treatments; healthy diet and weight management; relaxation and stress relief; spiritual tourism, including meditation and yoga, whether classical or as exercise; and health-related education. Wellness travelers may seek procedures or treatments using conventional, alternative, complementary, herbal, or homeopathic medicine. Wellness resorts and retreats offer short-term, residential programs to address specific health concerns, reduce stress, or support lifestyle improvement. Individual teachers, trainers or wellness practitioners may privately rent resort centers, small hotels or sections of larger hotels themed for the purpose. Industry leaders meet for weekends in destination locations to discuss and promote their businesses. Cruise ships can offer wellness programs including the use of on-board spas. Destinations Wellness tourism is now an identifiable niche market in at least 30 countries. Twenty countries accounted for 85 percent of global wellness tourism expenditures in 2012. The top five countries alone (United States, Germany, Japan, France, Austria) account for more than half the market (59 percent of expenditures). North America As of 2014, the US is the largest wellness tourism market, with $180.7 billion in annual, combined international and domestic expenditures. The US is the top destination for inbound international wellness tourism, with 7.1 million international, inbound trips. Europe and high-income Asian countries are primary sources of wellness tourists traveling to the US. Domestic tourism accounts for the majority (94 percent) of wellness trips in North America. Americans and Canadians receive‚Äîand take‚Äîfew vacation days compared to workers in other countries making domestic, weekend trips the most popular wellness travel option. Europe Europe is the second largest wellness tourism market, with $158.4 billion in annual, combined international and domestic expenditures; the region ranks highest in number of wellness trips with 216.2 million, compared to North America's 171.7 in 2013. Europeans have long believed in health benefits derived from mineral baths, saunas, thalassotherapy, and other natural and water-based treatments. Thermal resorts and hotels in Turkey and Hungary cater to wellness tourists, many of whom are subsidized by host countries such as Norway and Denmark seeking to mitigate costs of medical procedures for patients with chronic conditions requiring expensive surgeries. Asia-Pacific The Asia-Pacific region ranks as the third largest with $6.4 billion in annual, combined international and domestic expenditures. Ancient regional wellness traditions include Indian Ayurveda, Yoga, traditional Chinese medicine, Hilot, and Thai massage. Latin America- Caribbean Latin America-Caribbean is the fourth largest region for wellness tourism in terms of number of trips and expenditures. Domestic tourism accounts for about 71 percent of wellness tourism trips, and 54 percent of wellness tourism expenditures. Middle East and Africa The Middle East and Africa are currently the smallest regions for wellness tourism. The Middle East has a long tradition of bathing associated with Turkish baths, and some older facilities are being modernized to serve spa-bound tourists. Tourism is on the rise in the region, and governments and private developers are developing new facilities. In Africa, wellness tourism is concentrated in a few regions such as South Africa and the Maghreb; it is dominated by international tourists. Criticism Wellness tourism advocates suggest that vacations improve physical well-being, happiness, and productivity, citing that health-oriented trips give travelers a fresh perspective and positively affect creativity, resilience, problem solving, and capacity for coping with stress. Yet the health benefits of wellness vacations expected and reported by vacationers have proved difficult to quantify.

The tenth named storm in the western Pacific that year, Morakot spawned from an area of disturbed weather in the Philippine Sea on July 31\\\\. Tracking northwest, favorable conditions allowed for the intensification of the system to tropical storm strength on August 2\\\\. Morakot reached peak intensity later that day with winds of 85 km/h (50 mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 992 mbar (hPa; 28.29 inHg). This intensity was held for several hours until less conducive atmospheric conditions slightly weakened the system; this was followed by Morakot making landfall on southern Taiwan on August 3\\\\. Subsequently, the storm weakened and moved into the Taiwan Strait before making its final landfall near Quanzhou, China the next day. The storm quickly weakened over the Chinese mainland, and dissipated entirely several hours after landfall. In Taiwan, where Morakot first made landfall, heavy rainfall resulted in flooding. Commercial flights, schools, and rail service in some areas was cancelled in advance of the storm. Precipitation there peaked at 653 mm (25.71 in) over a period of nearly two days in Taitung County. Crop damage also resulted from the rainfall, and was estimated at over NT$70 million (US$2 million). In China, record rainfall was reported. The worst impacted city was Quanzhou, where losses due to Morakot reached CN¬•240 million (US$29 million) and one death was reported. Power outages were also widespread across southeastern China. Due to preexisting drought conditions, 703 cloud seeding operations took place in order to artificially generate added rainfall; such operations resulted in moderate precipitation over the targeted area. Overall, Morakot caused roughly $31 million in damage and three deaths. Meteorological history In late July 2003, an area of disturbed weather began to persist northwest of Chuuk in the Philippine Sea, and was first noted by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) early on July 30. As atmospheric conditions remained favorable throughout the day's duration, the system organized, and was upgraded to tropical depression status by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) at 0600 UTC on July 31, followed by the JTWC at 0600 UTC and Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) six hours later. The PAGASA consequently named the system Juaning for local purposes. Tracking north- northwestward under the influence of a passing trough, the system intensified further into a tropical storm by 0600 UTC on August 2, thus receiving the name Morakot. At the time, the storm was well organized with a steady outflow pattern. Intensification continued, and at 1800 UTC on August 2 the JMA determined Morakot to have peaked in intensity with winds of 85 km/h (50 mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 992 mbar (hPa; 28.29 inHg); however, the JTWC still considered Morakot to have been a strengthening tropical cyclone at the time. The appearance of a ragged eye prompted the agency to upgrade the storm to typhoon status at 0600 UTC on August 3, though other agencies still maintained Morakot's tropical storm classification. Over the rest of the day the cyclone moved rather erratically before making its first landfall on Tainan, Taiwan late on August 3. Morakot had slightly weakened prior to landfall and as such estimates from the JMA of the storm's intensity at the time of landfall were slightly lowered to 75 km/h (45 mph). Despite the slowing of the storm's forward motion as it moved across the island, passage over Taiwan was brief and Morakot entered the Taiwan Strait by early on August 4. The cyclone's northwesterly track brought the storm to a second landfall, this time near Quanzhou, China, at approximately 1000 UTC that day. Weakening was quick over China, and by two hours after landfall the JMA declared Morakot to have weakened below tropical depression intensity. The JTWC continued to monitor the system until it was determined to have dissipated by 0000 UTC on August 5. Preparations and impact Due to the storm's projected path into Taiwan, the Central Weather Bureau issued a sea and land warning on August 2. Commercial flights between Taiwan and Green and Orchid Islands were cancelled, as well as rail service along Taiwan's eastern coast. Morakot's passage over southern Taiwan resulted in significant rainfall across the island. Precipitation from the tropical cyclone peaked at 653 mm (25.71 in) over nearly two days in Taitung County. The rains uprooted trees in southeastern Taitung City and triggered some landslides. Flash flooding was reported in Pingtung County. Additional landslides blocked highways there, and elementary and junior high schools in the county were forced to close. Power outages also occurred and impacted hundreds of residences. Crop damage ensued from the precipitation, and amounted to over NT$70 million (US$2 million). Heavy rainfall and flooding also occurred in China. A station in Jinjiang, Fujian recorded 544 mm (21.42 in) of rain in an 18-hour period; this was the most torrential rainfall event for the city since records began. Heavy rains also fell in Zimao Town, where 334 mm (13.15 in) of rain was documented in eight hours. Quanzhou City was heavily impacted by the rainfall, and total losses there reached CN¬•240 million (US$29 million). One death resulted in the city. Further south in Heyuan, widespread power outages were caused by torrential rainfall. Winds blew two people off of a high falsework, killing both. The rainfall from Morakot in China somewhat relieved persistent drought conditions in the region. Following the passage of the tropical storm, however, 703 cloud seeding missions were carried out in Fujian Province in order to produce enhanced artificial rainfall. This included the deployment of 1,027 rockets and 14,700 cannonballs containing silver iodide. As a result of these, rainfall totals ranging from over a area were attributed to anthropologically enhanced precipitation. Though not directly related to Morakot, the storm's cyclonic circulation helped in part to produce thick smog and low visibility conditions in parts of Hong Kong. Naming In 2002, the name Hanuman was replaced prior to being used, due to objection by the India Meteorological Department for reason of religion.

Overview The river rises in the Mamores mountain range approximately halfway between Ben Nevis and Loch Treig, 370m above sea level. In its upper reaches it is known as Water of Nevis, becoming River Nevis at the bridge near Achriabhach. It is partly fed by the Steall Waterfall, one of the highest waterfalls in Scotland. The river flows through Glen Nevis and on to the town of Fort William where it is crossed by the Nevis Bridge on the A82 road. Its mouth is at the sea loch of Loch Linnhe where it meets the sea within the estuary of the River Lochy. The river shares its name with an amateur football team playing in the Glasgow Colleges Football Association. History During the Battle of Inverlochy (1645) many of Argyll's men were drowned as they tried to cross the river while fleeing from the Royalist forces. The river and Loch Linnhe were important natural defences considered in the construction of Fort William in the late 17th century. Leisure The river has a salmon population which was threatened in the 1990s but has improved since. The river and its glen are tourist destinations for fishing, walking, cycling, canoeing and climbing, and are regarded as among the most scenic destinations in the country. Several guidebooks document walking trails along the river, including the northern end of the West Highland Way. Upstream the river's depth varies widely dependent upon seasonal rainfall and snowmelt, and at Steall Meadows the river can be waded on foot at certain times; a three-wire simple suspension bridge is provided for when the flow does not permit this. For canoeists the upper reaches of the river at Scimitar Gorge, when swollen by heavy rainfall, are designated a Grade 5 stretch, demanding a very high level of concentration and skill and described by the Scottish Canoe Association as a \\"maelstrom of water\\".

A specialist sprinter, she is best known for winning the Breeders' Cup Turf Sprint in 2012 and 2013. Background Mizdirection is a dark-coated gray mare with a white star bred in Kentucky by Joseph J. Perrotta. Her sire Mizzen Mast, from whom she inherited her gray coat, won the Prix de Guiche on turf in France but improved when he was exported to the United States to race on dirt, winning the Malibu Stakes and the Strub Stakes. At stud he has sired many other good winners including Ultimate Eagle (Hollywood Derby), Mast Track (Hollywood Gold Cup), Midships (Charles Whittingham Memorial Handicap) and Flotilla (Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies Turf, Poule d'Essai des Pouliches).

The fictional Holocaust-related thriller and drama is inspired by the July 1941 Jedwabne pogrom in occupied north-eastern Poland during Operation Barbarossa, in which 340 Polish Jews of Jedwabne were locked in a barn later set on fire by a group of Polish males who were motivated by antisemitism.P.A.I.C., The Jedwabne Tragedy.

Ignatiew (July 9th , 2002), Jedwabne: Final Findings of Poland's Institute of National Memory. Communiqu√©. Polish Academic Information Center, University of Buffalo. Plot The film is a contemporary drama. It takes place in the fictional village of Gur√≥wka in 2001. The story begins with the return of Franciszek Kalina (Ireneusz Czop) to his hometown in rural Poland after having lived in Chicago for two decades. He learns that his brother J√≥zef (Maciej Stuhr) is shunned by the community for acquiring and displaying on his farmland dozens of Jewish tombstones which he discovered had been used by German occupying forces as paving stones in a now abandoned road. J√≥zef is gathering the tombstones everywhere in the settlement and moves them into his own field to survive from oblivion. Against the growing opposition of the town residents, the Kalina brothers attempt to learn more about what happened to the Jews of the village. Their personal relationship, harsh after the brothers met, warms and becomes more cooperative after they both find themselves opposed by the whole village. The older priest blesses the brother and urges him to continue gathering the tombstones while the new one, to head the parish soon, displays no sympathy for Jews. Franciszek discovers in a local archive that his father along with other men of the village got the land that had been owned by Jews before the war. He is eager to study the truth. After speaking to some of the oldest residents in the village, the brothers subsequently realize that half the residents of the village murdered the other half (led by a neighbor and their father Stanis≈Çaw Kalina). This discovery results in a terrible fight and split between the brothers after a dispute about the bones of the Jews they found the night before. After learning that their own father was directly involved in the murder of the Jews who were burned to death in the family's former house, the brothers' roles are reversed. Now it is J√≥zef who wants to keep the truth from coming out to the world, while Franciszek wants the world to know the truth and for the bones of the murdered Jews to be taken to their wheat field and buried with their headstones, so as to not compound the terrible sins of their father and neighbors. In a fight, Franciszek comes close to killing his brother J√≥zef but Franciszek stops himself, puts the ax down and leaves the village by bus to go back to America. But he is returned to the village by a hospital nurse/doctor‚Äîthe daughter of one of the oldest surviving neighbors who had known the truth but kept it secret‚Äîonly to see his brother J√≥zef beaten, stabbed, and then nailed high on the inside of the barn door, his arms outstretched. His wrists and feet held by wooden cleats. The movie ends with a scene of a group of young and older Israeli Jews being led by an Orthodox Rabbi reciting the Kaddish, the Jewish prayer in memory of the dead, in front of a formal memorial stone, at the now restored cemetery in the area of the stones that J√≥zef had placed in his fields, while Franciszek watches with respect, lights a candle, leaves it on one of the tombstones and nodding slightly to the scene, turns and walks away.

W≈Çodzimierz Nowak * Danuta Szaflarska as the elderly herbalist Production notes The inspiration for Pasikowski to write and direct the film, which was originally titled Kaddish (the Jewish prayer read by those in mourning), was the controversy in Poland surrounding the 2000 publication of Neighbors by Polish-American historian Jan T. Gross. According to Gross's historical research into the 1941 Jedwabne pogrom, Polish gentiles had murdered the hundreds of Jewish residents of Jedwabne, contrary to the official history which held the Nazi occupying force accountable. Gross's account of the Jedwabne massacre was a jarring development for Poles, \\"accustomed to seeing themselves as victims during World War II\\", rather than the victimizers. Nationalists opposed to these findings accused Gross of anti- Polish slander and misrepresenting the historical truth. At the same time though, it inspired among Poles \\"a new curiosity in Polish Jewish history\\", including for Pasikowski. Pasikowski stated, \\"The film isn't an adaptation of the book, which is documented and factual, but the film did grow out of it, since it was the source of my knowledge and shame.\\" Over the course of about a decade, Pasikowski struggled to have the film produced. He encountered difficulties \\"securing financing for his controversial script\\" and \\"struggling with how to best approach what is, for many Poles, still a largely taboo subject\\". Ultimately, it took seven years for producer Dariusz Jab≈Ço≈Ñski to receive backing from the state film fund for Aftermath. Aftermath was the first feature film produced by Pasikowski in a decade. Reception=Poland In Poland, the film reignited the controversy about the nature of the Jedwabne massacre, which began with the publication of Gross's Neighbors. The film was praised by government officials and leading cultural figures, including culture minister Bogdan Zdrojewski, filmmaker Andrzej Wajda, and Polish film historian Malgorzata Pakier. Conversely, many of typical spectators were infuriated. The movie was condemned by \\"nationalist politicians, banned in some towns and excoriated on the Internet\\". The right- wing newspaper Gazeta Polska described the film as \\"mendacious and harmful for Poles\\". Wprost, one of Poland's largest weekly, ran a cover with Stuhr's image framed in a Jewish star, accompanied by the headline, \\"Maciej Stuhr‚ÄîWas He Lynched at His Own Request?\\"  Worldwide  The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 79% approval rating with an average rating of 7.2/10 based on 29 reviews. As of April 2, 2014, Metacritic gives the film a weighted average score of 62/100, based on 12 reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\", with no user reviews at this time. Accolades Aftermath has won a few awards, including the Yad Vashem Chairman's Award at the Jerusalem Film Festival in 2013, Jan Karski Eagle Award in 2013, and Winner ‚Äî Critics Prize, Gdynia Film Festival 2012.

(Archive) Around the early 1990s portions of the City of Bellaire west of the 610 Loop were zoned to Jane Long Middle,McAdams, p. 57. while portions inside the 610 Loop were zoned to Pershing Middle School.McAdams, p. 58. \\"Bellaire residents who lived east of the 610 loop were zoned to Pershing Middle School\\" After its formation, the Bellaire Area School Improvement Committee (BASIC) installed a gifted and talented magnet at Jane Long. A 32% tax increase championed by HISD superintendent Frank Petruzielo funded the new magnet program which opened in August 1992. The new principal started work that month. Donald R. McAdams, a former HISD school board member and author of Fighting to Save Our Urban Schools-- and Winning!: Lessons from Houston, wrote that the magnet program was \\"successful\\" and that the new principal was \\"extraordinary.\\" McAdams stated that \\"In a few years Long showed dramatic improvement in appearance, discipline, and test scores.\\" McAdams described it as a school that was \\"unacceptable\\" to non-Hispanic White Bellaire residents since it was less than 10% white. McAdams added that even with the new program, to many parents in Bellaire, Long was \\"never going to be acceptable\\" due to the overwhelming Hispanic presence. McAdams recalled that one parent told him \\"I don't care how good the gifted program becomes. I don't care what you do to Jane Long, I will never place my daughter there with all those Hispanic boys.\\" In October 2006, Michael Marquez, president of the Hispanic Housing and Education Corporation, which operated the Las Am√©ricas apartments, announced to HISD in a letter that the organization would terminate the lease agreement between HISD and the apartment complex because of issues related to maintenance and management, affecting the HISD schools housed there. The district decided to vacate the property instead of appealing the decision.Radcliffe, Jennifer. \\"Education / Apartment complex and HISD part ways / Both sides cite maintenance as an issue at the ad hoc site for low- income pupils.\\" Houston Chronicle.

In the 2010-2011 school year the school had 244 sixth graders when it had been expecting 200. De La Rosa credited this to the introduction of an after-school program jointly operated by Citizen Schools, the addition of monthly parenting workshops, and the extension of the school hours of Long Middle.Mellon, Ericka. \\"HISD faces politically tough choices in closing schools.\\" Houston Chronicle.

The Futures program had its first set of graduating students, most of whom not only received their high school diploma, but also a two-year associate degree in pharmacy technology through Houston Community College. The 57 graduates of the inaugural class earned more than $2 million in scholarships, many full- ride, to finish at four year universities. The middle school had an allied health magnet program, wherein students studied topics relevant to the more than 100,000 jobs in the Houston Medical Center, and made preparations to attend the magnet high school. Four Jane Long Academy students were chosen to represent their generation of hope and achievement by addressing the crowd of educators and community leaders at the State of the Schools event, March 2016. Programs In 2010 the school had a Peer Mediator Program to teach students how to resolve conflicts peacefully.Turner, Allan. \\"Calling all teen filmmakers: Houston library wants you for festival.\\" Houston Chronicle.

JLA offered an accelerated program of study through Pre-AP/GT classes in middle school, and college classes in high school. Successful extracurricular programs included a variety of sports, including football, volleyball, basketball, soccer, and track and field. Jane Long Academy has also housed successful competition teams in robotics, Science Olympiad, and name-that-book and math competitions. In 2016, a partnership was formed between theater arts students at Jane Long and the Theater Under the Stars. Students were hosted by TUTS and viewed \\"In the Heights\\", a Lin-Manual Miranda play about Latino life in New York. Then actors from the play travelled to Jane Long Academy to work with the students, develop stories of their own, and produce a film representative of their cultures and lives. In partnership with the Houston Rockets, NASA, and Houston Community College, Jane Long Academy students visited Space Center Houston and learned about space exploration and the physics of flight. They were given model rockets to build, which the students later launched at the northeast campus of HCC. The school welcomes families not only from Mexico and Central America, but also refugees from all parts of the globe, such as Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Ethiopia, Congo, and Nigeria. It has been said that more than 50 different languages are spoken by students at Jane Long Academy. School uniforms The school requires its middle school students to wear school uniforms. The school first adopted school uniforms, called \\"standard mode of dress\\", in 1994. Robert Farquharson, the principal, stated that parents requested uniforms since many came from countries were students normally wore school uniforms.Markley, Melanie. \\"Dressing for success/More schools have pupils don uniforms.\\" Houston Chronicle.

Linking up the coalfield parishes of East Kent. Including; the parishes of Deal, Ash, Aylesham, Chillenden, Eastry, Eythorne, Elvington, Goodnestone, Nonington, Northbourne, Coldred, Staple, Tilmanstone and Wingham. The trail is approximately in length. A link route creates two shorter walks of around 14 miles each. The Waymark for the trail is a white circle with a Miners lamp, train and leaf. A Cycle Trail also follows most of the trail, starting and finishing at Deal. Sections of the cycling route follow the existing Sustrans National Cycle Network Regional Route 16 (Dover to Canterbury, via Adisham) also and connects with Regional Route 17 (to Sandwich). Linking to the Viking Coastal Trail and National Cycle Route 1. The route can be comfortably completed in a day. History In 2001, Dover District Council launched the 'Coalfields Heritage Initiative Kent' (CHIK) project, led by Dover Museum and the White Cliffs Countryside Project. The CHIK project's aim was to record and preserve East Kent's mining heritage. In 1890, Coal was discovered near Dover; this led to a small industry based on the mineral being set-up. Many coal mines were started, only to quickly fail, and just 4 collieries survived; Snowdown, Tilmanstone, Betteshanger and Chislet. Most of the workers for these new mines came from traditional coal areas, including south Wales, the Midlands and the North East. New villages were built to house them, including Aylesham, Elvington, Hersden and Mill Hill in Deal. The last colliery, Betteshanger, closed in 1989. The trail has then been developed following current public footpaths, bridleway and byways to link all these coalfield linked villages. Much of this arable landscape, with its many hedges and woodlands, has not changed since Saxon times, boasting a long and rich history. The trail also links to the North Downs Way (another long distance path between Canterbury and Dover) and the East Kent Light Railway at Shepherdswell. A guide book of the trails is available.

She was an early exponent of female leadership in the Scout movement and played a leading role in the introduction of the Wolf Cub programme for younger boys, both in the United Kingdom and in France. Barclay wrote numerous children's stories and instructional Scouting handbooks, and in later life wrote about her Christian faith. Early life Barclay was born on 10 November 1893, one of eight children of the Reverend Charles W. Barclay, a Church of England clergyman and his wife, Florence Louisa Charlesworth, a successful novelist. The family lived in the village of Hertford Heath in Hertfordshire to the north of London, where Reverend Barclay was the vicar from 1881 to 1920. (p. 2) The family were frequent visitors to St Moritz in the Swiss Alps; Barclay was an enthusiastic tobogganist and one of the few females to tackle the Cresta Run, often dressed in skirts or riding jodhpurs.Walker, p. 6 Scouting Barclay Co -Founder of Cubs, joined the Scout movement and took charge of the village Boy Scout Troop in 1912. In 1913, the founder of the Scout movement, Robert Baden-Powell, had launched a provisional scheme for boys who were too young to join the Scouts at the age of 11 years. Originally called \\"Junior Scouts\\", it had been renamed \\"Wolf Cubs\\" by January 1914. Barclay was regularly pestered by younger village boys wanting to join the Troop, so she opened the 1st Hertford Heath Wolf Cub Pack and persuaded her younger sister Angela to lead it. Barclay realised that there would be many women willing to run Cub Packs and wrote an article entitled \\"How a Lady Can Train the Cubs\\"; it was published in the official Scout magazine, the Headquarters Gazette, in January 1915. At the 1st World Scout Jamboree in 1920, 500 Wolf Cubs perform a Grand Howl in the arena at Olympia, London, organised by Vera Barclay. In June 1916, Barclay attended a meeting of Wolf Cub leaders at the Scout Association Headquarters in London. The article had obviously caught Baden-Powell's attention, because he approached her to become the Wolf Cub Secretary at Imperial Headquarters. She accepted Baden-Powell's offer as her war work with the British Red Cross at a hospital in Netley in Hampshire was becoming impossible due to a pre-war knee injury incurred whilst skiing. One of her first tasks was to help Baden-Powell to edit the drafts for The Wolf Cub's Handbook, which was published in December 1916. She devised many of the tests and badges that appeared in this first edition. In 1920, she organised a Grand Howl by 500 Cubs at the 1st World Scout Jamboree at Olympia, London; at the end of the ceremony, she was presented with the Silver Wolf for services \\"of the most exceptional character\\" to Scouting. A recent convert to Roman Catholicism, Barclay spent a brief spell trying her vocation with the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul. She later lived in Edgbaston in Birmingham, where she resumed her Scouting activities and was a leading member of the Catholic Scout Guild who ran a campsite at Hall Green for Cubs and Scouts from disadvantaged backgrounds. In the early 1920s, Barclay was a frequent visitor to France, where she encouraged the development of Les Louveteaux or Wolf Cubs in the Scouts de France. In 1923, she was at the first French Wolf Cub Wood Badge course at the Ch√¢teau de Chamarande and was later awarded the Cross of St Louis by the Scouts de France. Her connection with Scouting ended in 1931, when she emigrated to France and then Switzerland.Walker, pp. 2‚Äì5 Writing Barclay was a prolific author, mainly of books for children, but also about Christianity and Scouting. Perhaps her best known works are the \\"Jane\\" series of stories for girls. She wrote some books under the pen names Margaret Beech and Vera Charlesworth, and one detective story was written under the name of Hugh Chichester. Barclay was a Catholic creationist who rejected evolution. She was also critical of theistic evolution.MacConaill, Michael A. (1952). Review: Evolution and Enthusiasm.

She authored Darwin Is Not for Children (1950) and Challenge to the Darwinians (1951).

Later life Barclay returned to England before the start of World War II and lived in Felpham on the south coast from around 1938 and in 1939 / 40 joined her brother , the Rev Cyril Charles Barclay ( Vicar of Helmsley ) with his wife Rose and daughter Mary-Rose , in a huge vicarage (now the North York Moors Trust ) in the market town of Helmsley North Yorkshire , she started a small nursery school with her friend Ninette Hoffet which they ran in the vicarage, she later returned to The Midway , Felpham long before the end of the war . After living in London and Seaview 0n the Isle of Wight where she began to lose her eyesight, she ended her days at Sheringham in Norfolk, being cared for by her niece Betty. She died on 19 September 1989 at St Nicholas' Nursing Home, Sheringham, and is buried in Sheringham Cemetery.

Since then the band was featured in the 2008 film The Rocker, where another song from the future album, \\"Tailgate\\", was briefly played. The film also featured a re-recording of the song \\"Dirty Old Man\\" with new lyrics, retitled \\"Pompeii Nights\\". The film's soundtrack album was also released and included \\"Pompeii Nights\\" and an excerpt of the song \\"Take No Prisoners\\". Between 2009 and 2012 no new releases by The Rage were made, until the release of Big Spill in 2013. The album features previously known band's songs with the addition of new ones, and follows mostly hard rock style except for \\"One Mistake\\", the gentle piano song, and \\"Black Fly\\", which is a dance influenced track.

This disease is common in tropical areas and is not usually found in temperate environments. Demodicosis is characterized by the formation of papules and nodules over the cattle's skin. These lesions most commonly occur on the neck, shoulders, and armpit of cattle; however, sometimes they also appear on the udder. This condition is often found in cattle with increased stress from pregnancy or lactation. Natural and acquired immunity can cause a decrease in the number of mites infesting a cow, as well as decreasing the severity of a cow's symptoms. Demodicosis occurs when female mites lay eggs in hair follicles. Each follicle may contain hundreds or thousands of mites, which leads to the formation of skin papules and nodules. These papules and nodules, or bumps beneath the skin, can be felt even before they can be seen. Typically, the papules and nodules last for a month and then are replaced with new ones. They typically are found in the greatest numbers during spring and summer. Their size can range from as small as a pinhead to as large as a chicken egg. The larger ones are formed when the cysts grow in size, forming granulomatous nodules, characterized by the blocking of the opening of the follicle by mites, keratin, and other remnants. These large cysts can burst, which causes open wounds to form. The thick, pus-like substance that comes out of these sores contains D. bovis, which can be spread to other animals. Another way mites can be spread is when female mites leave the follicle they are in and go lay eggs in a new follicle. This form of transfer can spread the condition to different follicles on an already infected cow, as well as to other cows and animals through copulation or other physical contact. For instance, mites may be transmitted to calves within a few days of nursing, when the shoulders and hips of calves contact the infected mother. The burst nodules and papules can damage the cattle's skin, which results in economic losses due to problems with leather production.

The Kildonan School was exclusively for students with dyslexia and language-based learning disabilities. The school announced in August 2019 that it will close for the 2019-20 school year and will not reopen.  History  The Kildonan School was founded in 1969 by Diana Hanbury King and Kurt Goldman. The college preparatory program, that as of the school's closing in 2019 had a 100% college acceptance rate, evolved from Dunnabeck, the one-to-one Orton-Gillingham based language remediation summer camp also founded by Diana King, which takes place on the school‚Äôs campus every summer. Ms. King taught for years at Sidwell Friends School in Washington, D.C. and at Camp Mansfield in Vermont, the latter of which was founded by Helene Durbrow, who studied directly under Dr. Samuel Orton. Ms. King has written numerous books on the Orton-Gillingham approach, and she lectures across the country and trains teachers in Orton Gillingham methodology in the US, in Bermuda, and in Asia.  The Orton-Gillingham approach  The Orton-Gillingham approach is a structured, flexible, multisensory way of teaching reading and writing. When implemented at integral times and in appropriate ways, it has been shown to remediate dyslexia to the point of ‚Äúnormal‚Äù counterparts. It remediates dyslexia by attending to the neural language-processing system of individuals with high IQs with a seemingly inexplicable deficit in reading or spelling, and departs from older methodologies that focused on the visual system.  Accreditation  The Kildonan School was accredited in 2003 by the Academy of Orton-Gillingham Practitioners and Educators and re-accredited by NYSAIS (the New York State Association of Independent Schools) in 2013. As of the school's closing in 2019. The Kildonan School had two AOGPE Fellows on staff who mentor each tutor the school employs through 70 hours of pre-tutoring training and the AOGPE associate/certification process.  Complementary programs  Dyslexic students learn language differently from other students ‚Äì specifically, it has been posited that dyslexics compensate for lack of activity while reading in the angular gyrus (responsible for signifiers in language and residing in the back of the brain) with much activity in the inferior frontal gyrus (responsible for speech and residing in the front of the brain). Research shows, therefore, that dyslexic students tend to also have trouble with balance and coordination. In keeping with brain research that shows that language remediation relies on stimulating connections between brain networks, and specifically between the two hemispheres of the brain, The Kildonan School requires all lower school students to train in horseback riding and all upper school students to learn to ski. These two sports are balance sports, and so require students to make neural connections between both hemispheres of the brain.  Mission and philosophy  Kildonan‚Äôs mission of empowering students with dyslexia is in keeping with research by Brock and Fernette Eide and Ben Foss, which shows that a way to open up future opportunities for dyslexics is to play on their strengths. To this end, Kildonan encourages its staff to include The Dyslexic Advantage and The Dyslexia Empowerment Plan in their professional development plans.

It is one of the central results of polyhedral combinatorics. Originally known as the upper bound conjecture, this statement was formulated by Theodore Motzkin, proved in 1970 by Peter McMullen, and strengthened from polytopes to subdivisions of a sphere in 1975 by Richard P. Stanley. Cyclic polytopes The cyclic polytope Œî(n,d) may be defined as the convex hull of n vertices on the moment curve (t, t2, t3, ...). The precise choice of which n points on this curve are selected is irrelevant for the combinatorial structure of this polytope. The number of i-dimensional faces of Œî(n,d) is given by the formula : f_i(\\\\Delta(n,d)) = \\\\binom{n}{i+1} \\\\quad \\\\textrm{for} \\\\quad 0 \\\\leq i < \\\\left\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{d}{2}\\\\right\\\\rfloor and (f_0,\\\\ldots,f_{\\\\left\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{d}{2}\\\\right\\\\rfloor-1}) completely determine (f_{\\\\left\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{d}{2}\\\\right\\\\rfloor},\\\\ldots,f_{d-1}) via the Dehn‚ÄìSommerville equations. The same formula for the number of faces holds more generally for any neighborly polytope. Statement The upper bound theorem states that if Œî is a simplicial sphere of dimension d ‚àí 1 with n vertices, then : f_i(\\\\Delta) \\\\leq f_i(\\\\Delta(n,d)) \\\\quad \\\\textrm{for}\\\\quad i=0,1,\\\\ldots,d-1. That is, the number of faces of an arbitrary polytope can never be more than the number of faces of a cyclic or neighborly polytope with the same dimension and number of vertices. Asymptotically, this implies that there are at most \\\\scriptstyle O(n^{\\\\lfloor d/2\\\\rfloor}) faces of all dimensions. The same bounds hold as well for convex polytopes that are not simplicial, as perturbing the vertices of such a polytope (and taking the convex hull of the perturbed vertices) can only increase the number of faces. History The upper bound conjecture for simplicial polytopes was proposed by Motzkin in 1957 and proved by McMullen in 1970. A key ingredient in his proof was the following reformulation in terms of h-vectors: : h_i(\\\\Delta) \\\\leq \\\\tbinom{n-d+i-1}{i} \\\\quad \\\\textrm{for} \\\\quad 0 \\\\leq i < \\\\left\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{d}{2}\\\\right\\\\rfloor. Victor Klee suggested that the same statement should hold for all simplicial spheres and this was indeed established in 1975 by Stanley using the notion of a Stanley‚ÄìReisner ring and homological methods.

For example, nerve tissue is transplanted from one person to another. Allotransplantation is a commonly used type of transplantation of which nerve repair is one specific aspect. The transplant is called an allograft, allogeneic transplant, or homograft. Currently the only FDA approved nerve allograft is the Avance graft of AxoGen.  Nerve allograft  A nerve allograft is used for the reconstruction of peripheral nerve discontinuities in order to support the axonal regeneration across a nerve gap caused by any injury. It is human nerve tissue, processed to remove cellular and noncellular factors such as cells, fat, blood, axonal debris and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans while preserving the three-dimensional scaffold and basal lamina tubular structure of the nerve. This means the nerve allograft only consists of extracellular matrix (ECM), which is sterile and decullularized. There are three types of nerves; * Sensory nerves ‚Äî carry sensory information from peripheral organs (e.g. skin) to the central nervous system. They are responsible for sensation and proprioception. * Motor nerves ‚Äî carry information from the central nervous system to peripheral organs (e.g. muscles). Nerve signal activity modulates muscle contraction, thereby enabling movement. * Mixed nerves ‚Äî contain both sensory and motor fibers. In a trauma or surgical resection, a nerve can be damaged, which is called a nerve defect. This defect needs to be repaired in order to regain full or partial sensory and motor function. Peripheral nerve injury is a major clinical problem and can result in neuropathic pain, which is pain arising as a direct consequence of a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory system. Damaged nerve fibers continuously excite electric pulses, inducing pain or abnormal sensation dysesthesia. It has been shown that in allograft surgeries, post- operative neuropathic pain was present in some patients, but only if they suffered from this condition pre-operatively.Yates D (2013) Processed nerve allograft for trigeminal nerve repair: safety and effectiveness in sensory nerve reconstruction. J of Oral and Maxillofac Surg. 71 (9), 14 ‚Äì 15 Patients without neuropathic pain before their surgery did not complain about neuropathic pain afterwards. Hence, allograft treatment does not seem to be a risk factor for this specific problem. Golden standard therapy for transected nerves is an end-to-end repair of the nerve, also known as primary nerve repair. With a certain amount of tension on the nerve due to the injury, the blood flow to the nerve decreases, which can eventually lead to ischemia and nerve damage. The gap between the nerve ends could then, for example, be bridged by a nerve that is harvested from a less critical area from the same patient. The piece of nerve used in this case is called an autograft autotransplantation.Siemionow M. (2007) Nerve allograft transplantation: a review.

Sural nerve donor- site morbidity: thirty-four years of follow-up. Ann Plast Surg 2006;57:391‚Äì395. A commonly used nerve for autotransplantation is the sural nerve in the upper leg. Unfortunately, this treatment does have some disadvantages. First, there is a risk of donor site morbidity and functional loss. Secondly, patients have an increased risk of symptomatic neuroma formation. Thirdly, a longer anaesthesia time is needed because of the additional surgical site for the donor nerve. Lastly, higher costs also due to the extra surgical site. Despite these downsides, reducing the function of the affected area is beyond the risks committed with harvest of the donor nerve.Brooks D.N. (2012) Processed nerve allografts for peripheral nerve reconstruction: a multicenter study of utilization and outcomes in sensory, mixed and motor nerve reconstructions. Microsurgery. 32 (1), 1 - 14 In case of insufficient amount of autologous nerve tissue or the inability to attach both nerve ends securely and tension free, these two options are not possible. Another option to bridge the gap is nerve allotransplantation. Nerve allografts are prepared from donated human nerve tissue. An allograft contains many of the beneficial characteristics of nerve autograft, such as three- dimensional microstructural scaffolding and protein components inherent to nerve tissue. One of the adverse effects of nerve allotransplantation is the immunogenic response. Tissue from another human being is used to restore the defect, which can induce an immunogenic response. An immune response against an allograft or xenograft is called transplant rejection. To prevent this rejection, new immunosuppressive techniques are performed on the graft, before it is transplanted into the receiver. The donated nerve tissue is disinfected, by selectively removing cellular components and debris to cleave growth inhibitors and then terminally sterilized. These procedures make the immunogenic response insignificant. Since a couple of decades processed nerve allografts has been used to restore nerve continuity.  History  Rhazes, a Persian doctor, was the first who mentioned nerve repair in 900 AD. Nerve regeneration, is described for the first time in 1795 and in 1885 the first nerve allograft transplantation was reported.Albert E. (1885) Einige Operationen an Nerven. Wien Med Presse 26,1285‚Äì1288 In 1945, after WWII, Sir Sunderland described the anatomy of the peripheral nerves and developed techniques to improve the outcomes of nerve repair. A successful regeneration for short allografts (<4 cm) was achieved. However, there was a period of failure to accomplish successful recovery for all the allografts longer than 4 cm. Therefore, ‚ÄòThe Peripheral Nerve Injury committee‚Äô did not support nerve allograft until, in the early 1970s the first successful clinical trials on longer grafts were reported by using a new combination of radiation and freeze-drying techniques. Nowadays rejection is still an adverse effect of nerve allotransplantation, but modern immunosuppressive regimens are used to prevent this rejection. This is why these days, rejection has become a very rare complication and nerve allograft has become more relevant.  Anatomy and physiology of nerves  Nerve Anatomy An axon is the part of a neuron which conducts electrical impulses. Axons are surrounded by myelin, which contain Schwann cells. Schwann cells improve the electrical conduction. The myelin is surrounded by endoneurium, which is a protective sheath of connective tissue. This is surrounded by perineurium and epineurium, of which the latter is the outmost layer of dense connective tissue. When it comes to nerve repair, it is crucial that those layers make a good connection.  Transplantation techniques  There are several kinds of organ transplantation techniques. * Nerve autotransplantation is transplantation within the same person. However, when there is a large nerve defect, there may be an insufficient number of nerves available for transplantation. The nervus suralis, a nerve from the lower leg, is most often used. Consequently, the patient will miss the specific nerve used as an autograft; therefore a person‚Äôs own nerves can not be used for an unlimited number of times. * Nerve isotransplantation is tissue transplanted between two genetically identical persons. This technique can only be used if a person has a twin brother or sister. * Nerve xenotransplantation means tissue transplanted between two different species. This technique is not often used. * Nerve allotransplantation is the transplantation of a nerve to a receiver from a genetically non-identical donor of the same species.  Clinic  The surgery of an allograft nerve can be explained in a few steps. First the surgeon has to prepare the broken nerve to do the standard operation procedures. This means the surgeon has to examine the local tissue and resecting scar tissue if needed. The proximal and distal segments of the injured nerves should be debrided to healthy tissue by visual and tactile signs. After that, the surgeon measures the distance between both nerve ends as well as the diameter of the damaged nerve. The processed nerve allografts come in different sizes, so that a gap can be closed without unwanted tension. When he has chosen the right allograft nerve, the procedure is no different from when an autograft is used. The same applies to the microsurgery, that a surgeon may use to repair the nerve. This means the sutures which connect the allograft with the damaged nerve are placed in the epineurium. So all other important anatomical structures of the nerve are kept intact.  Autograft vs allograft  There are several factors that help a surgeon decide whether he should choose a nerve-autograft or an allograft. The differences between autografts and allografts are discussed above. The use of nerve autografts has some disadvantages. One is that the surgeon always creates a defect on the ‚Äòdonorplace‚Äô, from where the nerve is taken. Another disadvantage is that when the defect is large, the amount of available autografts may be insufficient. Nerve allografts bring a possible solution for these problems. Because allografts are human nerves, processed in such a way that the immune response against the transplant is not provoked, the procedure differs little from the autograft-procedure except for the fact that there is no need to create a ‚Äòdonorplace‚Äô defect. Therefore allografts can be used more often in the same patient than autografts. After the nerve is repaired, whether it is by using an autograft or an allograft, wallerian degeneration will be seen distal to the coaptation. This means that the part of the nerve that lies distal to the breaking point starts dissolving. The other end of the nerve will then grow back in this direction. The surgeon‚Äôs transplant then only functions as the shell through which this growth can take place. Studies suggest that nerve allografts work just as good as nerve autografts and are therefore a good alternative to the classic nerve autograft.  Gap length  Currently nerve reconstruction is limited in length. There is a relationship between the length of the nerve gap and the level of recovery following nerve repair. Two large clinical studies have divided three different gap lengths: 5-14mm, 15-29mm and 30-50mm nerve gaps. After adjustment for technical failures. The nerve grafts of 5-14mm had a 100% meaningful level of functional recovery in both studies. For nerve grafts above 15mm is seen in both studies a meaningful recovery around 80%. It seems likely that a shorter nerve gap has a better recovery, but despite that a significant difference was not found.  Motor vs sensory nerves  Since some studies on nerve allotransplantation determined the outcomes of sensory, motor and mixed nerves separately, the meaningful recovery for each nerve type has been assessed. Comparison of these outcomes has found no difference in successful recovery.Taras J.S. (2013) Allograft Reconstruction for Digital Nerve Loss. J Hand Surg. 38 (10), 1965 ‚Äì 1971 In other words, the sensation and movement of the affected body parts, in most studies the forearm, equally improved. Successful recovery of all three nerve types was achieved in approximately 80 to 85% of cases. Mixed nerves had a slightly lower recovery rate than sensory and motor nerves, but the success rate was still within the range just mentioned. Concluding, allograft surgery can be appropriately used for the functional repair of nerve injury in sensory, motor and mixed nerves.  Conclusion  The use of nerve allografts is a relatively new development and therefore autografts are currently still used more frequently. Efforts are being made to determine which procedure, i.e. autograft or allograft surgery, is preferred for each nerve type, but more research needs to be done. No comparison of these two procedures has been made in one single clinical study, let alone in a randomized controlled trial. This specific study type is of crucial value for evidence-based medicine.

The Trust also \\"serves people living in North London, Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire and East Hertfordshire\\". The trust is part of the East of England Local Education and Training Board, and has students from UCL Medical School. In July 2016 Katie Fisher from the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust took over as Chief Executive. She left in March 2018.  History  The trust was established on 23 March 2000, and became operational on 1 April 2000. Finance It has wrestled with the financial difficulties of running on several sites for many years. In June 2012 it was proposed to develop a local general hospital on the Hemel Hempstead Hospital site. In January 2015 the trust was operating with a deficit of ¬£16.3 million - at that point in the year ¬£4.3 million worse than planned, but with expectation of hitting its budgeted deficit target of ¬£14 million. A loan for ¬£11.1 million towards the trust‚Äôs capital costs has been approved by the Department of Health; a request for another ¬£22.7 million of temporary borrowing was at that point still being considered. In February 2016 it was expecting a deficit of ¬£37.2 million for the year 2015/6. The trust is expecting about ¬£400 million capital funding from the government‚Äôs new infrastructure fund for the rebuilding of Watford General Hospital, which will come with a 3.5% yearly interest charge. Criticism and praise Former Chief Executive Samantha Jones was named by the Health Service Journal (HSJ) as Chief Executive of the Year in November 2014. The Trust's daily Onion patient safety meeting, \\"an initiative aimed at improving patient care and empowering hospital staff to raise concerns about the quality of care provided\\", was also Highly Commended in the 2014 HSJ Awards The Onion's name refers to \\"the scheme ‚Äòpeeling back the layers‚Äô within its hospitals\\". Performance In December 2013 the Trust was one of thirteen hospital trusts named by Dr Foster Intelligence as having higher than expected higher mortality indicator scores for the period April 2012 to March 2013 in their Hospital Guide 2013. The mortality rate subsequently fell by a quarter, an improvement credited to issues raised and dealt with at Onion meetings. The trust was one of 26 responsible for half of the national growth in patients waiting more than four hours in accident and emergency over the 2014/5 winter. It was put into special measures In September 2015 after the Care Quality Commission rated its services as ‚Äúinadequate‚Äù. The inspectors found A&E; patients at Watford General facing long delays before they were examined by a doctor where unqualified staff assessed A&E; arrivals, and there was a dangerous lack of nurses. The problems were attributed to understaffing over a long period and excessive use of agency and locum staff. It moved out of special measures in January 2018 following a CQC inspection where it was rated as 'Requires improvement'. It spent 9.7% of its total turnover on agency staff in 2014/5. Because it failed to meet the NHS targets for elective treatment - 92 patients had waited more than a year in October 1918 - the Herts Valley Clinical Commissioning Group decided to fine the trust ¬£500,000 a month until its performance reaches the national target of 92%. The money will be spent on private and specialist providers. The trust expects at least a ¬£53 million deficit for 2018-19.

Gordon Melton (ed.), New York: Facts On File, c2005, p. 162. The meaning and the scope of functions varies strongly, also along the separating lines of the Protestant denominations and church bodies. EPCAAL's Supreme Consistory in Strasbourg History Starting in 1539 the term was used for a body taking over the jurisdiction in marital matters, and later also church discipline, so that Protestant consistories can be regarded as successors not to the papal consistory in Rome but rather to the courts of Roman Catholic bishops.The encyclopedia of Protestantism, Hans J. Hillerbrand (ed.), New York: Routledge, 2004, . In the Lutheran or Reformed states of imperial immediacy in the Holy Roman Empire episcopal offices were not staffed any more and the secular government assumed the function of the bishop (summepiscopate, summus episcopus), looked after by the consistories. Not all Protestant churches adopted consistories, especially not collegially governed churches, often of Reformed or Presbyterian confession. Consistories were either bodies of local churches (mostly in the Reformed tradition), or parastatal entities, like in the French model, or they were governing bodies as part of the administration of Protestant state churches (Lutheran, Reformed and United Protestant alike). The rather governmental character of the consistory is the reason why the term was given up in many church bodies after the separation of religion and state and the concomitant abolition of the status as state church and the assumption of church independence. In countries under French influence the Protestants, Calvinists and Lutherans alike (and the Jews as well, see Israelite consistories), made use of the term in the beginning of the nineteenth century with the enactment of the Organic Articles, when the movement for political emancipation demanded the creation of a representative body, whereas Napoleon's government simultaneously aimed at gaining influence onto the non-Catholic religious bodies. Roman Catholicism in Napoleon's realm was subject to the Concordat of 1801. The consistories in the French Empire could transact official business with a government in the name of the Protestants and vice versa. Furthermore, the desire for reform among the educated classes demanded the creation of a body vested with authority to render religious decisions. Anglican usage \\"In Anglican churches the consistory is the diocesan court, usually presided over by the bishop's chancellor or commissary. It deals with a variety of issues at the diocesan level, and its decisions may be appealed to higher courts in the national church.\\" Usage in Lutheran and united churches APU's Berlin Consistory sat in the Collegienhaus between 1737 and 1826, sharing it with the Kammergericht, and again from 1913 to 1945 as the sole user. In the Lutheran tradition, and derived from that similarly in some united and uniting Protestant churches, the consistory is a body governing the ecclesiastical affairs in a specific ambit, comprising either all congregations (aka parishes) within a Protestant church body (thus forming a leading body, with executive and /or spiritual competence for a church), or only those in a district organisation (consistorial district; ) or in a regional organisation (such as an ecclesiastical province; ). In the latter two cases, typical in churches with a congregational polity, the term consistory is also used to designate the geographical area administered by the consistory. APU's former Posen-West Prussia Consistory, now the office of an oil and gas drilling company in Pi≈Ça. In 1539 Martin Luther and his associates established the (1539‚Äì1816) in Wittenberg upon Elbe competent for the Lutheran church in the Saxon within the then realm of the Ernestine line of the House of Wettin. Although originally an ecclesiastical court of the Saxon Lutheran church, the consistory developed into an administrative body appointed by the sovereign to supervise the church within his state. In other Lutheran states the consistories took similar developments. Consistories, forming executive body of a state church, had often great powers through the authority of the secular government. In history, before separating executive and juridical competences, consistories of Lutheran state churches with central executive powers, therefore usually consisting of jurisprudents and clergy, did also function as courts appointed to regulate ecclesiastical affairs.\\"Consistory\\" (entry), in: American Heritage Dictionary, retrieved on 2 December 2013. At times the consistories were parastatal offices in charge of all (Protestant) denominations (e.g. in Bremen-Verden) or even all religions (e.g. in Prussia, see Evangelical Church in Prussia from 1808 to 1816) in the respective territory. While Lutheran churches often still did not form legal entities distinct from the state, the consistories turned out to be the oldest body of many modern regional Protestant church bodies, which developed into independent legal entities in the 18th and 19th centuries. By the French Organic Articles each time several parishes (paroisses) of the EPCAAL form a consistory (consistoire), terming the board and its district alike.Cf. \\"Etudes: Cultes protestants\\" , on: Institut du Droit Local Alsacien-Mosellan (IDL), retrieved on 17 December 2013. The consistories are of legal entity status. Each consistory holds property of its own and receives contributions by the member parishes. Each EPCAAL consistory comprises all the pastors active in its district and the double number of laypersons, elected in three year terms by the local church presbyteries, as well as some members co√∂pted by the church executive Directory (directoire). The consistorial members elect from their midst their executive, the consistorial council (Conseil consistorial) of four members. Consistorial decisions are presented to the French minister of the Interior, who may oppose them within a two-months period, and reported to the superior EPCAAL Supreme consistory (Consistoire sup√©rieur). Reformed usage The Dokkum Consistoriekamer (consistorial chamber), venue of the Reformed local church elders. In the Reformed (Calvinist) tradition the consistory is the authority in the local church, generally made up of all the teaching Elders (ministers) and the ruling elders (lay leaders). The consistory then forms the head of individual congregations (or parishes) also in charge of implementing the policies of the synod and/or assembly of which it is part, and providing for church discipline of the church members where necessary.Nicholas Weber, \\"Reformed Churches\\", in: The Catholic Encyclopedia, vol. 12, New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911, retrieved on 2 November 2013. A panel sometimes called the Great Consistory, convoked if considered necessary for special consultations, would include the current consistory and former elders and deacons. Congregations (kerkgemeenten) within the Protestant Church in the Netherlands rooted in the 2004-merged Dutch Reformed Church often call their local church councils or consistorie (consistory, else also called kerkenraad, i.e. church council). EPG's Genevan Consistory: Session in the time of Calvin. When John Calvin was invited to take over supervision of the Reformed Church of Geneva (EPG), he insisted on the creation there of a new disciplinary institution called the Consistory, and drafted the ecclesiastical ordinances that created it himself in November 1541. The Genevan Consistory consisted of all the pastors on the Genevan republic's payroll plus a dozen lay commissioners or elders to whom were assigned the duty of visiting households and checking upon the conduct of the inhabitants. The members of the consistory, technically a committee of the city government, were elected for one-year terms in the elections in which the city government was reconstituted every year. In weekly meetings the consistory examined people accused of misbehaviour. If the charges proved of substance, the consistory had a range of options including referring the person for counselling or, in more severe cases, to the civil courts. \\"In 1555, excommunication was added to its powers.\\" About one-fifteenth of the entire adult population of the republic was annually summoned before the consistory. As much as Calvin's theology with his emphasis on church discipline, the Genevan Consistory gave the city-state particular and the Reformed Church of Geneva its unique lifestyle. Also in the Protestant Reformed Church of Alsace and Lorraine (EPRAL) several parishes form a consistory (consistoire), with the term used for the board and its district alike. As religious statutory law corporations the consistories have legal entity status, holding property of their own and receiving contributions from member parishes. EPRAL consistories are made up and organised like their EPCAAL counterparts (see above). Unlike their EPCAAL counterparts the EPRAL consistories appoint the pastors after proposition by the presbytery of the concerned parish. Consistories today EKBO's Berlin Consistory, former building The Evangelical Church of Berlin-Brandenburg-Silesian Upper Lusatia (EKBO, a church comprising Lutheran, Reformed and united congregations) uses the term consistory () for its administrative office. This consistory was founded in 1543 and underwent a number of alterations of its official naming and functions in compliance with the development of the constitution of the church. Also the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Latvia and the Protestant Church of Luxembourg (Consistoire de l'Eglise Protestante du Luxembourg) use the term consistory for their central administrative offices. The Lutheran Protestant Church of Augsburg Confession of Alsace and Lorraine (EPCAAL) maintains its Supreme Consistory (Consistoire sup√©rieur), functioning as the supreme spiritual body, and 40 regional consistories, established in 1802 but later partially reorganised and renamed. In the Lutheran Evangelical Church of the Augsburg Confession in Poland the Consistory of the Church () serves as the chief administrative authority and the executive board of the synod.Cf. \\"Konsystorz Ko≈õcio≈Ça\\", on: Centrum Informacyjne Ko≈õcio≈Ça Ewangelicko- Augsburskiego w Polsce, retrieved on 2 December 2013 In the Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church the consistory (konsistoorium) is the administrative board of the church.

Designations for members The designations for the members of consistories alter as to their functions and status as clergy or laymen.

Accessed by traditional web browser, smartphone app, phone, or SMS, residents can use the system to submit issues, such as road maintenance or waste management, and create an issue tracking ticket. Co-founders Lily Liu and Vincent Polidoro began to develop PublicStuff in 2009 and officially launched the service in 2010. To date, PublicStuff is used in approximately 250 cities in the United States. In 2015, PublicStuff was acquired by Accela, a San Ramon, CA-based Govtech company. Background Liu created PublicStuff after a 10-year career in urban administration positions in California, Washington D.C., and New York City. In a 2013 Forbes Magazine article, Liu was quoted as saying that, \\"I started really understanding how difficult it was for a city that wanted something that I believe every city should have: the ability to provide great customer service. But it was so difficult and so expensive. There wasn‚Äôt anything out-of-the- box, ready-to-go that allowed cities to better communicate with their residents.\\" Early adopters of the PublicStuff software include Philadelphia, PA and Plano, TX. The company has since added Tallahassee, FL, North Miami Beach, FL, Asheville, NC, Newport Beach, CA, Aurora, CO, Palo Alto, CA, and Daly City, CA, among others. Use Local governments generally engage with PublicStuff on a contractual basis. As clients, municipalities have access to a CRM backend that allows staff to manage workflow, and make internal or public comments on resident requests. Municipalities can customize the mobile app experience by, for example, modifying the user interface or adding widgets. Push notifications enable government officials to alert residents of ongoing events, emergency alerts, and status updates. PublicStuff is also available in municipalities that are not enrolled in the service. Requests in unsubscribed municipalities, termed \\"orphan requests,\\" are routed to the PublicStuff staff, who manually route the requests to the correct municipal department. Submitting a request PublicStuff routes location-tagged photographs, written descriptions, and telephone-reported issues to relevant municipal departments and then relays status and outcome back to the user who filed the request. Users can monitor issue status and add comments to request additional information. One Voice PublicStuff's One Voice technology translates from 16 different languages, allowing residents that speak English as a foreign language to more easily submit requests. Funding Prior to acquisition, PublicStuff raised $6.55 million in funding from FirstMark Capital, the Knight Foundation, Lerer Ventures, First Round Capital, and High Peaks Venture Partners.

He was educated at Harrow, where he was a contemporary of Lord Curzon. He played for his school on the cricket XI in various matches between May 1868 and July 1869, including matches with Eton College, Marylebone Cricket Club and I Zingari. His performance was not exceptional. After returning to Calcutta he became known as a strong rackets player and an excellent cricketer. He was both a forceful batsman and a brilliant fielder. Businessman Alexander Apcar's father died on 16 May 1863 at the age of 85. Alexander became head of the family firm after the death of his three elder brothers, Apcar, Seth and Thomas.

They are all members of Ireland's Travelling Community, and use traditional Traveller work such as laying tarmac or home renovation as cover for illegal activities. Their name comes from their links with the town of Rathkeale in Ireland, which has been described as their \\"base\\". The gang's crimes include fraud, money laundering, drug smuggling, and art theft. The European Union's law enforcement agency, Europol, set up Operation Oakleaf in 2011 at the request of the Garda S√≠och√°na (Irish Police), in order to gather intelligence on the group. This led to 30 arrests in eight countries for money laundering, drug trafficking and organised robbery worldwide. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service has also investigated the group with regard to the smuggling of rhino horns. Investigators worked with South African police and Europol. In October 2013, the New South Wales Fair Trading department issued a warning that the gang was operating on the Australian eastern seaboard. In November 2013, UK police from 26 forces and the Serious Organised Crime Agency arrested 19 people, believed to be members of the Rathkeale Rovers, as part of Operation Elven into a series of museum and auction house break-ins in 2012. 14 men were later convicted for their roles in the thefts. The 14 received prison sentences ranging from 15 months to six years and eight months (the maximum penalty for the charge is seven years). Four of them, all from the same family, were described by the prosecution as \\"generals\\" within the Rathkeale Rovers. The gang targeted Chinese antiquities and rhinoceros horns, intending to sell them to the Chinese black market. On 13 April 2012 the gang broke into the Fitzwilliam Museum while it was closed, stealing 18 jade objects valued at between ¬£15m and ¬£40m, none of which have been recovered and with most probably having ended up in China. They targeted Durham University Oriental Museum three times, on one occasion smashing a large hole through an external wall to gain access. Attempted thefts at Norwich Castle Museum and Gorringes auction house in Lewes were thwarted by visitors.

Career Rompecabeza Uno, 2000, Acrylic on Panel (8 parts), 28\\" x 26\\" Heilmann moved to New York City after graduating from Berkeley in 1968. Early in her career, Heilmann became interested in pop culture and minimalist sculpture, creating works which were inspired by these areas. Her move into painting saw her further experiment with new casual styles, techniques and mediums, bright colors, drips, flatness, and unusual geometries. Furthermore, Heilmann's life on the West Coast has also greatly influenced her work, which also focuses on notions of biography and memory. One of Heilmann's earliest successes as a young painter was her 1972 inclusion in the Annual Exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art, where she exhibited a red monochrome piece entitled The Closet, also known as Ties in My Closet. She is respected among her fellow painters, and has been called \\"one of the most important abstract painters of her generation\\".Myers, T.R. ' ' Mary Heilmann: Save the Last Dance for Me' '.

Among the achievements is a substantial increase in the amount of drinking water supplied from reservoirs, long-distance water transfers and desalination at a low price to consumers, thanks to the country's substantial oil and gas revenues. These measures increased per capita water supply despite a rapidly increasing population. Another achievement is the transition from intermittent to continuous water supply in the capital Algiers in 2011, along with considerable improvements in wastewater treatment resulting in better water quality at beaches. These achievements were made possible through a public-private partnership with a private French water company. The number of wastewater treatment plants throughout the country increased rapidly from only 18 in 2000 to 113 in 2011, with 96 more under construction. However, there are also many challenges. One of them is poor service quality in many cities outside Algiers with 78% of urban residents suffering from intermittent water supply. Another challenge is the pollution of water resources. There has also been insufficient progress concerning reuse of treated water, a government priority in this dry country. Access Traditional fountains such as this one in the old city of Algiers are being replaced by piped drinking water supply to homes. In 2015, in Algeria 84% of the population had access to \\"improved\\" water, 84% and 82%, in urban and rural areas, respectively. In 2015, there were still around 7 million lacking access to \\"improved\\" water. Regarding sanitation, 88% of the population had access to \\"improved\\" sanitation, 90% and 82%, in urban and rural areas, respectively.WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation According to the UN, 84% of Algerians had access to an improved water source in 2010. , including 74% that had access to drinking water on their premises. The remainder had access to fountains, standpipes, protected wells or protected springs, mostly in rural areas. 95% of Algerians had access to improved sanitation. The Algerian government states that access water supply is higher than shown in the UN statistics, with 93% being linked to drinking water networks in 2010. It also says that 86% of the population are connected to sewer networks.Algeria's drinking water supply increases by 3 times within a decade: president, Xinhua, 22 March 2011 Service quality Only 22% of urban residents in Algeria receive water 24 hours per day. 34% receive water only once per day, 24% every second day and 14% only every third day.Messaoud Terra from the Ministry of Water Resources quoting AdE figures, quoted in Alg√©rie-Focus: Un Alg√©rien sur quatre n‚Äôa l‚Äôeau potable qu‚Äôun jour sur deux, 19 August 2013 In some regions water only comes every 10 days, such as in the Bouzegu√®ne District and other districts in the Kabylie region. These shortages are poor execution and lack of completion of works, poor maintenance and numerous illegal connections to the network. Residents store water in tanks or jerry cans in their houses, or fill up jerry cans at water towers particularly during the summer.Kamel Kaci: Water shortages in northern Algeria: ‚ÄúWashing and cooking have become luxuries‚Äù, France 24, 10 December 2012 In Setif in Northeastern Algeria water shortages have led to protests and clashes with the police.Middle East Online:Algeria's Setif region fumes: Water shortages trigger protests, 2013-09-05 In contrast, in Algiers continuous water supply was established with the help of a French private company, SUEZ, in 2011.Jean-Marc Jahn, CEO of SEEAL: SEEAL performance in Algiers:From 8% to 100% 24/7 water supply in 3.5 years, in: Global water summit 2011:Focusing on performance, Global Water Intelligence 2011, p. 46-49. Water resources and infrastructure Drinking water in Algeria comes from conventional resources ‚Äì surface water and groundwater ‚Äì as well as non-conventional resources such as seawater desalination. Conventional water resources Reservoirs are a major source of drinking water in Algeria. For example, the Taksebt reservoir provides drinking water for residents of three provinces. Since rainfall is highly seasonal, surface water is stored in 72 reservoirs with a total production capacity of 7.4 billion m3 per year in 2009. Most of this water is used for irrigation. Total drinking water supply was about 2.8 billion m3 per year. One of the largest reservoir systems in Algeria is the Beni Haroun complex in Mila Province that supplies water for irrigation and drinking water to 4 million people in six provinces in the East of Algeria. Another large system is the Taksebt complex in Tizi Ouzou in Kabylie. It supplies three provinces, including parts of the capital Algiers, with drinking water. In the Bouira Province, water is supplied from the Koudiat Acerdoune dam. The longest water transfer project in Algeria, dubbed \\"project of the century\\", transfers non-renewable groundwater from In Salah to Tamanrasset in the Sahara over a distance of 750 km.Brahim TAKHEROUBT: L'eau c'√©tait lui!, L'Expression, 2 September 2013 It was completed in 2011 at a cost of US$2.5 billion.Algeria Press Service:Algeria‚Äôs experience in water resources management presented in Cairo, 6 June 2013 In some parts of the country, such as in the valleys of El Oued and Ouargla, a rising water table due to seepage from septic tanks was a major problem. Beginning in 2005 at a cost of almost US$1 billion sewers were laid, pumping stations and treatment plants were built to convey the reclaimed water to agricultural areas for reuse. Pollution of water resources has reached a worrying degree. Groundwater in the Mitidja plain close to Algiers is polluted with nitrates, and groundwater in coastal areas is often damaged by saline intrusion from the sea due to overpumping. This is the case in the Oran, Algiers and Jijel areas. Major parts of the rivers Tafna, Macta, Ch√©liff, Soummam and Seybousse are polluted. Some of them, such as the country's largest river, the Ch√©liff that supplies the Oran area, are used for drinking water supply. In the Constantine area the level of manganese and of chlorides in drinking water was close to those allowed by the WHO as of 2004.UN Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO): Alg√©rie, Aquastat, 2005 Non-conventional water resources Desalination = Algeria had 15 seawater desalination plants along its coast in 2011 with a capacity of 2.3 million m3/day. It plans to build 43 more until 2019. Several desalination plants supply the Oran area that is particularly water-scarce. The first one was inaugurated in 2005 under the name Kahrama close to the industrial zone of Arzew. 20,000 m3/day are supplied to industry and 70,000 m3/day to the city. Two smaller plants became operational a few months later. In 2009 the first phase of a much larger plant with a capacity of 200,000 m3/day was put into production in Chatt el Hilal to supply A√Øn T√©mouchent and Oran. Another 200,000 m3/day plant in Mostaganem was under construction as of 2010, as well as a plant in Mactaa with a capacity of 500,000 m3/day, making it one of the largest plants in the world.SEOR: Dessalement de l'eau de mer, retrieved on November 2, 2013 Prior to the completion of the Mactaa plant, the Hamma plant in Algiers completed in 2008 was the largest desalination plant in Africa with a capacity of 200,000 m3/day.Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC):Hamma Water Desalination: Bringing drinking water to the desert, no date, retrieved on 3 November 2013Water pollution is a serious issue in Algeria, as shown here in the Oued Soummam. = Water reuse = The reuse of treated wastewater for irrigation is a priority of the state. A government decree ‚Äì Decree No. 07-149 of 20 May 2007 ‚Äì sets out the procedures to grant a permit for the use of reclaimed water for irrigation. However, as of 2010 only 510 hectares were irrigated with reclaimed water. An additional 3,800 hectares were fully equipped for reuse without being operated. Studies for additional projects for irrigation of another 9,800 hectares with reclaimed water were completed. Infrastructure The water distribution system in Algeria is 105,000 km long. AdE manages a network of 50,000 km as well as 2,528 wells, 72 water treatment plants, 10 desalination plants, 1,141 pumping stations and 4,798 reservoirs. The sewer system is 41,000 km long and there are 113 municipal wastewater treatment plants, including 56 using activated sludge technology and 67 mostly smaller plants using different kinds of lagoon technologies. There were only 18 plants in the country in 2000; 96 more plants were under construction in 2011.Ministry of Water Resources:ALGERIA REPORT COUNTRY, presented by Hassina Hammouche, Chief Engineer DAPE, 22‚Äì24 May 2011, Dubai, retrieved on November 3, 2013 Water use The city of Oran in the dry western part of Algeria relies increasingly on desalination, after having suffered from protracted drought. According to government sources, in 2011 average water production was as high as 170 liter per capita and day. As of 2000, per capita water production varied between different parts of the country. It was highest in Ghardaia with 220 liter per capita per day and lowest in Sidi Bel Abbes with only 65 liter. In Oran and Mostaganem water production was only 70 liter. Actual water use is lower than the above figures because of distribution losses. Non-revenue water, consisting of physical and administrative losses, was estimated at 40% in 2004.SOGESID, for SEMIDE- EMWIS:Approvisionnement en eau et assainissement au niveau local:Rapport par pays - Alg√©rie, Novembre 2005, p. 4 and p. 16-17 Responsibility for water supply and sanitation=Policy and regulation The Ministry of Water Resources is in charge of policy-making for drinking water supply and sanitation, as well as for water resources management. Within the Ministry there is a directorate for drinking water and another directorate for sanitation and the environment. The Ministry also has 48 branches in each province (wilaya) of Algeria. Service provision 80% of water distribution systems in Algeria are under the responsibility of Alg√©rienne des Eaux (AdE), a state-owned company. Most sewer systems are under the responsibility of the Office National d'Assainissement (ONA). Both entities were created in 2001 and operate under the supervision of the Ministry of Water Resources that was established a year earlier. AdE serves 3.4 million customers in 814 out of 1,541 municipalities. By law it is charged not only to provide water services, but also to promote water conservation and to increase public awareness. The company operates extensive water transmission systems that transfer water over long distances, often covering several provinces. AdE has branches (unit√©s) in each of the country's 48 provinces. In each of the four largest cities of Algeria, a joint subsidiary of AdE and ONA provides water and sanitation services: * SEEAL in Algiers and in neighboring Tipaza, * SEACO in Constantine, * SEOR in Oran, and * SEATA in Annaba and in neighboring El Tarf. In other parts of its service area, AdE directly provides water services through 15 \\"zones\\", each comprising two to four provinces. In 2014, AdE had 25,000 employees. ONA operates sanitation systems on behalf of 708 municipalities and has more than 8,000 employees.ONA:ONA en chiffres, retrieved on November 2, 2013 It operates 68 wastewater treatment plants, about half the plants in the country. The remainder are operated by private companies operating under management contracts in the largest cities or by municipalities. The Algerian Energy Company (AEC) develops power plants as well as desalination plants. It is a subsidiary of Sonatrach and Sonelgaz. The private sector operates the water supply and sanitation systems of three large cities, i.e. Algiers, Oran and Constantine, under management contracts with AdE and ONA. Financial aspects=Investment and financing The Tamanrasset area in the Algerian Sahara benefited from a water transfer over a distance of 750km, completed in 2001 at a cost 2.5 billion US dollars. Algeria plans to invest 20 billion US dollar in the water sector during the Five-Year Plan 2010-2014.Ammar Belhimer, Eldjazair:L‚Äôeau, une priorit√© de l‚ÄôEtat, retrieved on November 3, 2013 Dams, which have accounted for 43% of water investments in 1995‚Äì2004, continue to be an important focus of water investments. Most investments are financed by the Algerian state from its vast oil and gas revenues. However, many desalination plants are financed by foreign direct investment through Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) contracts. Tariffs and cost recovery The legal basis for water and sanitation tariffs is Decree 05-13 of January 9, 2005, on tariff policy (politique de tarification). It specifies five tariff zones: the hydrographic zones of Algiers, Oran, Costantine, Chlef and Ouargla covering together the entire country. However, in practice water and sanitation tariffs are almost the same throughout the zones, with tariffs being only 3 percent lower in the Chlef zone and about 8 percent lower in the Ouargla zones compared to the three other zones. Tariffs comprise a fixed and a variable component. The decree also defines three user categories: residential; administration and services; as well as industrial and touristic. The variable tariff component for residential users increases by consumption blocks. In the highest of the four blocks is 6.5 times more expensive than in the lowest block. The tariff in the other two user categories corresponds to the tariff in the highest residential consumption block. Tariffs are very low and are far from covering the costs of supply. Tariff increases have to be approved by the national government. The first block of the residential tariffs, also called \\"social block\\" (tranche sociale), is charged until a consumption of 25 cubic meter per quarter, corresponding to 55 liter per capita per day for a family of five. In 2005 this tariff was 6.3 Algerian Dinar per cubic meter or 9 US Cents in the Algiers, Oran and Constantine zones.Boukhari S, Djebbar Y, Abida H:Prix des services de l‚Äôeau en Alg√©rie, un outil de gestion durable In 2014, this tariff remained unchanged according to the website of AdE.AdE: La tarification de l'eau potable, retrieved on March 27, 2014 This tariff is about 20 times lower than water tariffs in Central Europe. The sewer tariff is even lower than the water tariff. For residential users in the first block in the zones Algiers, Constantine and Annaba it is 2.35 Algerian dinar per cubic meter or 3 US cents. External cooperation The European Union (EU), through the European Commission, is an important external partner for the Algerian water sector. It provided a grant of 30 million Euro in 2011 to support sanitation through a program called EAU II. An earlier 20 million Euro grant called EAU I financed the updating of the National Water Plan, an operational plan for the Ghrib dam, an early warning and forecasting system for floods in Sidi Bel Abb√©s as well as an electronic documentation system for the Ministry of Water Resources.Algeriainvest: Programme d'assainissement de l'eau en Alg√©rie : Un plan de 4 milliards de DA, 25 July 2011 In 2011 the Soci√©t√© Wallonne des Eaux (SWDE) from Belgium and AdE signed a twinning contract to improve water quality monitoring.

Bulletin of Symbolic Logic. 19 (2013) 253‚Äì4. A generative grammar can be seen as a recursive definition in string theory. The most basic operation on strings is concatenation; connect two strings to form a longer string whose length is the sum of the lengths of those two strings. ABCDE is the concatenation of AB with CDE, in symbols ABCDE = AB ^ CDE. Strings, and concatenation of strings can be treated as an algebraic system with some properties resembling those of the addition of integers; in modern mathematics, this system is called a free monoid.

He was killed during the Armenian Genocide in 1915. Life Of Armenian descent, Haig (Hrach) Tiriakian was born in Trabzon, Ottoman Empire in 1871. In 1893, Tiriakian then went to Nancy, France where he studied agriculture until 1896. During his time in Europe, Tiriakian joined the Armenian Revolutionary Federation where his first assignment was assigned the planning of the Ottoman Bank takeover. The takeover was planned in order to raise further awareness and action by the major European powers. The bank was largely employed European personnel from Great Britain and France. Stirred by the inaction of the European powers in regards to Hamidian massacres, the Armenian Revolutionary Federation members saw its seizure as the best way to bring full attention to the massacres. The organizational planning of the takeover required Tiriakian to visit various countries around the world before the takeover took place. Tiriakian eventually took part in the seizure along with other Armenian political activists such as Armen Garo and Papken Siuni. \\\\- Profile at Google Books}} Tiriakian describes the event as follows: After the takeover concluded, Tiriakian was one of many participants who were exiled then shipped to Marseille, France. While in exile, Tiriakian attended the Second General Congress of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation held in 1898 in Tbilisi, Georgia which had him appointed the Responsible Body for the Cilicia region. After making a brief visit to Alexandria, Egypt, Tiriakian returned to the Ottoman Empire in secret. One of the main goals of his return was to gather money from wealthy Armenians in order to help fund the Armenian revolutionary movement. However, since the Ottoman authorities had an arrest warrant for him, he was caught and sent to life imprisonment in Bodrum. After the Young Turk Revolution in 1908, Tiriakian was set free and returned to Constantinople. In Constantinople, he became a publicist and manager of the Azadamard Armenian newspaper. Death Haig Tiriakian was arrested as part of the deportation of Armenian notables on 24 April 1915 during the Armenian Genocide. He was deported to Aya≈ü, a village in the interior of the Ottoman Empire. After learning that another Haig Tiriakian had been detained in Aya≈ü, he demanded his namesake's release and his own transfer from √áankƒ±rƒ± to Aya≈ü.

As its common name suggests, the spinose ear tick's parasitic forms are usually found within the ears of the definitive host. This tick has a worldwide distribution, with common hosts that include horses, cattle, sheep, goats, and dogs.  Importance  Spinose ear ticks are a constant source of annoyance and irritation for their definitive hosts. Their tendency to occur in large numbers can cause ulceration of the inner ear, high sensitivity of the ears, large amounts of blood loss, and even deafness. Heavily infested animals often shake and rub their heads, which can cause their outer ears to become excoriated and raw. Several cases of human infestation have been reported, and the tick has been incriminated in some instances of pathogen transmission.  Anatomy  As with many soft ticks, the mouthparts of O. megnini are not visible from the dorsal view. The nymph is somewhat violin shaped with tiny, backward-projecting spines covering the body, which are the reason for the description spinose in the common name. The adult may achieve in length, is brown, and has a slightly granular body cuticle. The male and female closely resemble each other; neither possesses a scutum.  Habitat  Although spinose ear ticks are generally associated with semiarid or arid environments such as those found in the Southwestern United States, they can also be found in other climate areas due to widespread interstate transportation of animals. Larvae and nymphs usually remain within the ears of their host. Fully grown nymphs and adults live off the host, but still within the host's general environment. They usually prefer dry, protected places such as in cracks and crevices or under logs and fence posts.  Lifecycle  O. megnini has a single-host lifecycle in which the larvae and nymphs remain deep within the external ear canal of their definitive host for long periods of time. The eggs are laid on or near the ground and hatch in 18 days or more. The larvae then crawl up vegetation, fence posts, or the like to wait for a host. They are capable of surviving without a host for more than 2 months. Once the larvae find a host, they migrate to the ears and feed for 5‚Äì10 days. They then molt and become nymphs, still remaining within the host's ear. The nymphs feed for about a month, after which they crawl out of the ear onto the ground to molt again and become adults. The nymphal stages can remain in the ear for 1‚Äì7 months, and adults can produce eggs for up to 6 months. Spinose ear tick adults do not feed; they absorb water from the atmosphere to survive.

He helped to form the National Union of Conservative Associations. Life Born on 2 March 1830 at Market Bosworth, Leicestershire, he was the youngest son of Arthur Benoni Evans by his wife Anne, daughter of Captain Thomas Dickinson, R.N.; Sir John Evans was his elder brother and the poet Anne Evans his elder sister. After early education under his father at the Market Bosworth grammar school, he won in 1849 a scholarship at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, graduating B.A. in 1853 and proceeding M.A. in 1857. On leaving the university Evans became a student at Lincoln's Inn on 29 January 1855, but was shortly appointed secretary of the Indian Reform Association, and in that capacity was the first man in England to receive news of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. That year he resigned the secretaryship and turned a talent for drawing to use, becoming manager of the art department of the glass-works of Messrs. Chance Bros. & Co., at Oldbury, near Birmingham. This position he occupied for ten years, and designed many windows, including one illustrating the Robin Hood legend for the International Exhibition of 1862. While working for the Indian Reform Association, Evans had met John Bright, and at Birmingham he made the acquaintance of Joseph Chamberlain, who became a friend. In 1867 Evans left the glassworks to become editor of the Birmingham Daily Gazette, a conservative newspaper. In 1868 he unsuccessfully contested Birmingham in the conservative interest in the general election and also helped to form the National Union of Conservative Associations. In the same year he took the degree of LL.D. at Cambridge. In 1870 Evans left the Gazette to pursue a legal career. On 17 November 1873 he was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn, and joined the Oxford circuit. He built up a practice, wrote leading articles for The Observer and contributing articles and stories, mostly with a tendency to the supernatural, to Macmillan's and Longman's magazines. In 1878 he shared in the foundation of The People, a weekly conservative newspaper, and edited it for the first three years of its career. When on the eve of the general election of 1886 the editor of the Birmingham Daily Gazette died suddenly, Evans resumed the editorship for a period. In the early 1890s, Evans became involved in the Neo-Jacobite Revival, joining the Order of the White Rose. Evans knew leading literati of the mid-Victorian period, and later was a close friend of Edward Burne-Jones, who illustrated his history of the \\"Graal\\". Towards the end of his life he retired to Abbot's Barton, Canterbury, where he died on 19 December 1909. Works While an undergraduate Evans published a volume of sonnets on the death of the Duke of Wellington (1852). His other published collections of poems were: *Brother Fabian's Manuscripts and other Poems, 1865. *Songs and Etchings, 1871. *In the Studio, a Decade of Poems, 1875. He translated Francis of Assisi's 'Mirror of Perfection' (1898) and Geoffrey of Monmouth's History (1904), and with his son Francis Lady Chillingham's House Party, adapted from √âdouard Pailleron's Le Monde o√π l'on s'ennuie (1901). In 1881 he re-edited his father's Leicestershire Words for the English Dialect Society. Evans was also a translator in verse and prose from mediaeval French, Latin, Greek, and Italian. In 1898 he published The High History of the Holy Graal (new edit. 1910 in Everyman's Library), a version of the old French romance of Perceval le Gallois, as well as an original study of the legend in In Quest of the Holy Graal. Evans exhibited at the Royal Academy and elsewhere pictures in oil, water-colour, and black and white, and practised wood-carving, engraving, and book-binding. Family In 1857 Evans married Elizabeth, youngest daughter of Francis Bennett-Goldney, one of the founders of the London Joint Stock Bank. Of two sons, Sebastian and Francis, the latter assumed the name of Francis Bennett-Goldney, and went into politics.

Opponent of Human Trafficking Perrin is involved with human trafficking research and activism, and wrote the 2010 book Invisible Chains: Canada's Underground World of Human Trafficking. This book deals extensively with a gang of pimps called North Preston's Finest and includes an account of the disappearance of Jessie Foster. Perrin received a George Ryga Award for Social Awareness in Literature nomination for having written this book. Perrin helped Joy Smith develop the National Action Plan to Combat Human Trafficking. In the 2009 Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report by the United States Department of State's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, he was the only Canadian named a TIP Hero. Perrin spoke at the news conference at the Vancouver American consulate during which the TIP report was released, and he called for Stephen Harper \\"to announce that he will enact a national action plan to combat human trafficking to follow up on the measures that his government has already taken.\\" Perrin said that not having such a plan in place makes Canada look bad internationally and also prevents the issue of human trafficking from being adequately addressed. Perrin argued that, if the plan was to be effective, it needed to establish a strategy for preventing human trafficking, protecting victims, and prosecuting traffickers. He further said that the establishment of a national action plan on this issue \\"should be a priority for our federal government to end this atrocious crime that is flourishing in Canada.\\" Political career He moved to Ottawa, Ontario in the late 1990s in order to become a policy intern for the Reform Party of Canada.

Education Michelsohn attended the Bronx High School of Science. She attended the University of Chicago for her undergraduate and graduate studies, including her PhD. She spent a year as a visiting professor at University of California at San Diego. She spent a year l'Institut des Hautes √âtudes Scientifiques outside of Paris, France. She then joined the faculty of State University of New York at Stony Brook. Mathematical work Michelsohn's PhD was in the field of topology. As of 2020, she has published twenty articles, on topics including complex geometry, spin manifolds and the Dirac operator, and the theory of algebraic cycles. Half of her work has been in collaboration with Blaine Lawson. With Lawson, she wrote a textbook on spin geometry which has become the standard reference for the field. In her most widely-known work, published in 1982, Michelsohn introduced the notion of a balanced metric on a complex manifold. These are hermitian metrics for which the penultimate power of the associated K√§hler form is closed, i.e. :d(\\\\underbrace{\\\\omega\\\\wedge\\\\cdots\\\\wedge\\\\omega}_{n-1\\\\text{ times}})=0, in which is the K√§hler form and is the complex dimension. It is trivial to see that every K√§hler metric is a balanced metric. As for K√§hler metrics, the above definition of a balanced metric automatically places cohomological restrictions on the underlying manifold; by Stokes' theorem, every codimension-one complex subvariety is homologically nontrivial. For instance, the Calabi-Eckmann complex manifolds do not support any balanced metrics. Michelsohn also recast the definition of a balanced metric in terms of the torsion tensor and in terms of the Dirac operator. In parallel to a work of Reese Harvey and Blaine Lawson's on K√§hler metrics, Michelsohn obtained a full characterization, in terms of the cohomological theory of currents, of which complex manifolds admit balanced metrics. Balanced metrics are, in part, of interest due to their role in the Strominger system arising from string theory.

Similar to Bootstrap and Foundation, it contains a wide range of HTML and CSS- based interface components, as well as optional JavaScript extensions. Origin Dissatisfied with the architecture of Bootstrap and Foundation, John Slegers wanted to create an alternative that offered more flexibility and better performance without cutting back on features. He came up with the name Cascade Framework for his project and released it under the MIT License in March 2013. Features Cascade Framework 1.x is written in pure CSS. It supports responsive design and all modern browsers as well as IE6+. For an optimal balance between footprint and flexibility, it implements a modifier design pattern inspired by SMACCS and OOCSS. Binpress lists the following key features:Binpress - Cascade Framework * Cascade Framework is entirely based on an OOCSS architecture optimised for both performance and flexibility. * Cascade Framework contains advanced components like ‚Äúpanels‚Äù, ‚Äútab blocks‚Äù and ‚Äúnavigation‚Äù components that can be combined in various ways. * Cascade Framework is design agnostic. You can choose the default theme, create one of your own or just work with your own project specific custom design and leave out the default theme entirely. Both typography and color scheme are separated in separate modules to suit that purpose. * Cascade Framework allows you to choose between a Semantic Grid technique and a presentational grid technique. Twitter Bootstrap offers only a presentational grid technique. * With Cascade Framework, you can use any number of columns you want (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,12,16 and 24 columns are supported) throughout your project and nest them freely. * Cascade Framework‚Äôs grid uses a special padding element for its gutter, which combined with the media object integration makes the grid both more powerful and easier to use than any other grid system. * The total CSS code of Cascade Framework is only 9712 bytes minified and gzipped and can be further reduced if you don't need all modules. For many projects, you‚Äôll do fine with a build of Cascade Framework with that‚Äôs only 3910 bytes. * Cascade Framework has a ‚Äúlight‚Äù version that‚Äôs no more than 2010 bytes in total. While it doesn‚Äôt contain components like panels or tabs, it still offers you a clean design for a whole bunch of elements, support for IE6, responsive behavior, etc. If you need just its grid features, you can go as lightweight as 323 bytes. * Cascade Framework offers support up to IE6 and there are no plans to drop support for older browsers in the near future.

One model uses Kan complexes which are fibrant objects in the category of simplicial sets (with the standard model structure). It is an ‚àû-category generalization of a groupoid, a category in which every morphism is an isomorphism. The homotopy hypothesis states that ‚àû-groupoids are spaces.  Globular Groupoids  Alexander Grothendieck suggested in Pursuing Stacks that there should be an extraordinarily simple model of ‚àû-groupoids using globular sets, originally called hemispherical complexes. These sets are constructed as presheaves on the globular category \\\\mathbb{G}. This is defined as the category whose objects are finite ordinals [n] and morphisms are given by > \\\\begin{align} \\\\sigma_n:[n] \\\\to [n+1]\\\\ \\\\tau_n:[n] \\\\to [n+1] \\\\end{align} such that the globular relations hold > \\\\begin{align} \\\\sigma_{n+1}\\\\circ\\\\sigma_n &= \\\\tau_{n+1}\\\\circ\\\\sigma_n \\\\ > \\\\sigma_{n+1}\\\\circ\\\\tau_n &= \\\\tau_{n+1}\\\\circ\\\\tau_n \\\\end{align} These encode the fact that n-morphisms should not be able to see (n+1)-morphisms. When writing these down as a globular set X_\\\\bullet:\\\\mathbb{G}^{op} \\\\to \\\\text{Sets}, the source and target maps are then written as > \\\\begin{align} s_n = X_\\\\bullet(\\\\sigma_n) \\\\ t_n = X_\\\\bullet(\\\\tau_n) > \\\\end{align} We can also consider globular objects in a category \\\\mathcal{C} as functors > X_\\\\bullet\\\\colon \\\\mathbb{G}^{op} \\\\to \\\\mathcal{C} . There was hope originally that such a strict model would be sufficient for homotopy theory, but there is evidence suggesting otherwise. It turns out for S^2 its associated homotopy n-type \\\\pi_{\\\\leq n}(S^n) can never be modeled as a strict globular groupoid for n \\\\geq 3. This is because strict ‚àû-groupoids only model spaces with a trivial Whitehead product.  Examples = Fundamental ‚àû-groupoid  Given a topological space X there should be an associated fundamental ‚àû-groupoid \\\\Pi_\\\\infty(X) where the objects are points x \\\\in X 1-morphisms f:x \\\\to y are represented as paths, 2-morphisms are homotopies of paths, 2-morphisms are homotopies of homotopies, and so on. From this infinity groupoid we can find an n-groupoid called the fundamental n-groupoid \\\\Pi_n(X) whose homotopy type is that of \\\\pi_{\\\\leq n}(X). Note that taking the fundamental ‚àû-groupoid of a space Y such that \\\\pi_{>n}(Y) = 0 is equivalent to the fundemantal n-groupoid \\\\Pi_n(Y). Such a space can be found using the Whitehead tower.  Abelian globular groupoids  One useful case of globular groupoids comes from a chain complex which is bounded above, hence let's consider a chain complex C_\\\\bullet \\\\in \\\\text{Ch}_{\\\\leq0}(\\\\text{Ab}). There is an associated globular groupoid. Intuitively, the objects are the elements in C_0, morphisms come from C_0 through the chain complex map d_1:C_1 \\\\to C_0, and higher n-morphisms can be found from the higher chain complex maps d_n:C_n \\\\to C_{n-1}. We can form a globular set \\\\mathbb{C}_\\\\bullet with > \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\mathbb{C}_0 =& C_0 \\\\ \\\\mathbb{C}_1 =& C_0\\\\oplus C_1 \\\\ > &\\\\cdots \\\\ \\\\mathbb{C}_n =& \\\\bigoplus_{k=0}^n C_k \\\\end{matrix} and the source morphism s_n:\\\\mathbb{C}_n \\\\to \\\\mathbb{C}_{n-1} is the projection map > pr:\\\\bigoplus_{k=0}^{n}C_k \\\\to \\\\bigoplus_{k=0}^{n-1}C_k and the target morphism t_n: C_n \\\\to C_{n-1} is the addition of the chain complex map d_n:C_n \\\\to C_{n-1} together with the projection map. This forms a globular groupoid giving a wide class of examples of strict globular groupoids. Moreover, because strict groupoids embed inside weak groupoids, they can act as weak groupoids as well.  Applications = Higher local systems  One of the basic theorems about local systems is that they can be equivalently described as a functor from the fundamental groupoid \\\\Pi(X) = \\\\Pi_{\\\\leq 1}(X) to the category of Abelian groups, the category of R-modules, or some other abelian category. That is, a local system is equivalent to giving a functor > \\\\mathcal{L}:\\\\Pi(X) \\\\to \\\\text{Ab} generalizing such a definition requires us to consider not only an abelian category, but also its derived category. A higher local system is then an ‚àû-functor > \\\\mathcal{L}_\\\\bullet:\\\\Pi_\\\\infty(X) \\\\to D(\\\\text{Ab}) with values in some derived category. This has the advantage of letting the higher homotopy groups \\\\pi_n(X) to act on the higher local system, from a series of truncations. A toy example to study comes from the Eilenberg‚ÄìMacLane spaces K(A, n), or by looking at the terms from the Whitehead tower of a space. Ideally, there should be some way to recover the categories of functors \\\\mathcal{L}_\\\\bullet:\\\\Pi_\\\\infty(X) \\\\to D(\\\\text{Ab}) from their truncations \\\\Pi_n(X) and the maps \\\\tau_{\\\\leq n-1}:\\\\Pi_n(X) \\\\to \\\\Pi_{n-1}(X) whose fibers should be the categories of n-functors > \\\\Pi_n(K(\\\\pi_n(X),n)) \\\\to D(Ab) Another advantage of this formalism is it allows for constructing higher forms of \\\\ell-adic representations by using the etale homotopy type \\\\hat{\\\\pi}(X) of a scheme X and construct higher representations of this space, since they are given by functors > \\\\mathcal{L}:\\\\hat{\\\\pi(X)} \\\\to D(\\\\overline{\\\\mathbb{Q}}_\\\\ell)  Higher gerbes  Another application of ‚àû-groupoids is giving constructions of n-gerbes and ‚àû-gerbes. Over a space X an n-gerbe should be an object \\\\mathcal{G} \\\\to X such that when restricted to a small enough subset U \\\\subset X, \\\\mathcal{G}_U \\\\to U is represented by an n-groupoid, and on overlaps there is an agreement upto some weak equivalence.

The currently recognized species in this genus are: * Aphareus furca (Lac√©p√®de, 1801) (small-toothed jobfish) * Aphareus rutilans G. Cuvier, 1830 (rusty jobfish)  Description  This fish belongs to the tropical snapper and sea perches family, Lutjanidae. It can be reality identified by their adult coloration. This fish contains long filaments at the tips of its tail fin. Its body is of a bronze/blue-gray color and it has yellow fins. It reaches a maximum length of 70 cm but more commonly found to be a length of 25 cm. Males may be identified by yellow present on the head.  Distribution  Aphareus furca are found in the Indo-pacific from the south of Hawaii to the Pitcairn Islands, West and East Africa. It has also been found from the Gulf of Mannar to the southern part of Japan going southward to Australia. It has been collected at depths of 1‚Äì122 m but also has been reported at depths of 302m. In the late 1990s, this species of fish was found at 38.6% of the sampling sites and accounted for 2.5% of the recorded biomass. From the years of 2008 to 2014 estimates of its density were at 2.5 to 41.2 individuals per hectare in Pacific coral reef areas. It has also been discovered that its population size is affected by fishing and in areas where that fishing pressure was relieved, population size increased. The highest population sizes were recorded in the US Line Islands and Phoenix Islands where those sizes were recorded to be 19.4 and 63 per hectare. Small measurements of population size ranging from 0.3 to 17.2 were found in the Federated States of Micronesia, Solomon Islands, the remote islands around the Solomon Islands, Fiji, and Raja Ampat.  Habitat  Aphareus furca is a benthopelagic and pelagic species that is mostly found to inhabit inshore coral and rocky reed areas, rocky bottoms, and clear water lagoons. This species is a piscivorous and can be found singly or in small groups. It is typically found at depths of 1‚Äì120 m, but it has been reported to be found at depths of 300 m.  Threats  Aphareus furca is vulnerable to many detrimental effects that can decrease its population. Capture of Aphareus furca by spearfishing and handlines or vertical longlines makes it a commonly sought after gamefish. This fishing has been found to be a main factor leading to its reduction in population size, especially in Fiji and the Philippines where this species is found close to the coast. Hunting and fishing is posing as such a threat for population size that in South Africa bag limits have been implemented to how many can be caught.

The first phase is due for completion in 2020, with the overall programme due to be completed by 2024.https://www.bsuh.nhs.uk/about-us/hospital-redevelopment/about-the- redevelopment/ After securing agreement from NHS Improvement, the Trust got planning permission in September 2017 for a ¬£30 million redevelopment of the Royal Sussex County Hospital‚Äôs A&E; department, including a new 70 bed short- stay ward.http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/15533199.__30m_A_E_expansion_given_the_go_ahead/ A new Emergency Ambulatory Care Unit (EACU) opened in March 2018, where medical and surgical teams work alongside each other to treat emergency patients who do not need to stay in overnight.https://www.brightonandhovenews.org/2018/03/28/albion-players-open- new-emergency-unit-at-brighton-hospital/ Performance Four-hour target in the emergency department quarterly figures from NHS England Data from https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/ae-waiting-times- and-activity/ In January 2019, the Care Quality Commission (CQC) rated the Trust as \\"good\\" overall and scored it as \\"outstanding\\" for caring.https://www.brightonandhoveindependent.co.uk/news/health/brighton- hospital-rated-good-as-it-s-taken-out-of-special- measures-1-8760775https://www.cqc.org.uk/provider/RXH/inspection- summary#overall The CQC found, after inspections in 2018, that \\"The trust had made huge improvements since the new executive team had introduced improved systems of working. The trust had a new strategy, vision and values which underpinned a culture which was patient centred. The ‚ÄòPatient First Improvement System‚Äô had empowered front line staff by equipping them with the lean tools, methods and a structured process which had helped to build and promote a culture of continuous improvement across the whole trust.\\" The CQC also found that the Trust's leaders \\"promoted a positive culture that supported and valued staff...There was a significant change in the culture since the last inspection. Bullying and acceptance of poor behaviour was no longer recognised by staff.\\"https://www.cqc.org.uk/sites/default/files/new_reports/AAAH5824.pdf This turnaround follows several difficult years at the Trust. A Care Quality Commission report in 2014 said that accident and emergency services at Royal Sussex County Hospital were inadequate for responsiveness, suffered significant pressures and lacked sufficient physical space to deal with the number of patients that attended. The trust was one of 26 responsible for half of the national growth in patients waiting more than four hours in accident and emergency over the 2014/5 winter. The trust spent ¬£14.7 million on agency staff in 2014/5. In March 2015 it was announced that the trust's 5-year contract with Sodexo for cleaning, catering and portering services which started in December 2012 would be terminated early in July 2015 by mutual consent after problems with staff pay and safety concerns over equipment and cleanliness standards. It ended 2015/6 in deficit of ¬£45 million. In June 2016 it reported a backlog of more than 9000 patients who had waited more than 18 weeks for treatment in breach of the target, and only 73% of current referrals were seen within the target. It did not expect to hit the target before March 2018. Following an inspection in April 2016, the Trust was given a formal warning by the Care Quality Commission in June 2016. It was told to improve its risk management as patients were being put at unnecessary risk because they were not being dealt with properly or in appropriate areas, to ensure the care privacy and dignity of people attending hospital and to ensure patients are seen in line with national timescales for diagnosis and treatment. It was put into special measures in October 2016. It had its accreditation suspended by the United Kingdom Accreditation Service in 2016 when staff shortages affected turn round times. NHS Improvement removed the existing management and contracted the executive from Western Sussex NHS Foundation Trust to provide leadership to the Trust for three years from April 2017. The Care Quality Commission inspected the Trust‚Äôs two main hospitals in April 2017, whose ratings improved from Inadequate to Requires Improvement. The CQC said that they had found ‚Äúsignificant improvements‚Äù across the Trust, but recommended it stays in special measures. The CQC concluded that ‚ÄúThere is no doubt that improvements have been made since our last inspection and that the staff involved in the delivery of that change should be congratulated. However, there remains an extensive programme of change to be delivered in order to attain an overall rating of good. The lack of consistent board and executive leadership has hampered the pace of change in the last twelve months and it is anticipated that the incoming management team can provide both stability and clarity of leadership that will lead to sustainable change.\\" In 2019 It was taken out of special measures but there were still concerns about performance against NHS targets. 160 12-hour trolley waits were reported from the A&E; department in January and February. 25% of patients waited six weeks or more for diagnostic tests in January. Only 77% against the 95% target of patients were seen within 18 weeks of referral and only 65.7% of cancer patients started treatment within the six week target. The trust is planning for a deficit of ¬£53 million on the year. It reported a 30% drop in hip and knee surgery patients in 2018-9, with twice the number of patients in the area choosing private providers for NHS-funded hip and knee operations. Diversity and Discrimination After a history of claims of discrimination at the Trust, the CQC found in its January 2019 report that \\"Staff felt equality and diversity were promoted in their day today work. We spoke with the newly formed Black and minority ethnicity working group...[who] told us that they had seen a dramatic change...Staff told us that although they had not always felt supported in the past since the new executive team had arrived they now felt confident that they could raise any concerns about staff behaviours towards them with their line managers, and they felt assured that their concerns would be listened to and acted on appropriately.\\" This is a significant change since the Care Quality Commission had found in August 2014 that there had been a ‚Äúsignificant increase‚Äù in disciplinary cases related to race discrimination. The Black and Minority Ethnic Network in the Trust passed a vote of no confidence in the trust board in November 2015. A petition was circulated claiming that ‚ÄúBME people are being subjected to unprecedented levels of racial discrimination, harassment and victimisation.‚Äù See also * Healthcare in Sussex * List of hospitals in England * List of NHS trusts References External links  * * Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust on the NHS website * Inspection reports from the Care Quality Commission Category:NHS hospital trusts Category:Health in Sussex ","title":"Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"id":"40965811","text":"Kittian and Nevisian Americans are Americans of full or partial Saint Kitts and Nevis ancestry, or Americans that were born in Saint Kitts and Nevis.

P. coatneyi occurs in Southeast Asia. The natural host of this species is the rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) and crab-eating macaque (Macaca fascicularis fascicularis), but there has been no evidence that zoonosis of P. coatneyi can occur through its vector, the female Anopheles mosquito. While P. coatneyi cannot be transmitted to humans, it is similar enough to Plasmodium falciparum to warrant laboratory study as a model species. History Plasmodium coatneyi was first discovered in 1961 by Dr. Don Eyles in the Malaysian state of Selangor. Plasmodium coatneyi was isolated from an Anopheles hackeri before being found in its primate host species. This was the first occurrence of acquiring a new form of malaria through its vector instead of an infected host specimen. The sample was first thought to be Plasmodium knowlesi due to the morphological similarities of the two species, but was later identified as separate due to having a tertiary periodicity compared to P. knowlesi‚Äôs quartan periodicity. The presence of P. coatneyi in a host was confirmed in 1963 by Dr. Eyles and his team when the protozoan was discovered in a crab-eating monkey found in the same area Selangor and again in a separate crab-eating monkey in the Philippines. The newly discovered species was then named in honor of Dr. G. Robert Coatney, an American malariologist. Life Cycle Chart of the genus Plasmodium life cycle. The life cycle of P. coatneyi takes the complex form representative of the genus Plasmodium. When a female Anopheles mosquito bites a human, a haploid form of the protozoan called a sporozoite is transferred from the salivary glands into the circulatory system of the human. These motile sporozoites are then taken by the circulatory system to the liver, where they invade the liver cells (hepatocytes). During the next 5‚Äì16 days, these sporozoites mature and divide by asexual reproduction into schizonts. Schizonts are structures that contain thousands of haploid merozoites, and rupture to release merozoites into the circulatory system. These merozoites then infect the red blood cells (erythrocytes) where they consume the hemoglobin of the red blood cells for energy and become immature, ring stage trophozoites. The trophozoites act as an intermediate stage, from which two forms can be formed. The trophozoites can mature into schizonts and release more merozoites into the circulatory system, or they can differentiate into still haploid gametocytes. The gametocyte is the sexual stage of the life cycle, with female macrogametocytes and male microgametocytes. Sexual reproduction does not occur in the human host. Instead, the gametocytes only fuse to form a diploid zygote when ingested by the female Anopheles. The fertilization takes place in the stomach, where the zygotes can move into the midgut after they differentiate into motile version of the zygote, an ookinetes. Ookinetes then mature into oocytes inside the epithelial tissue of the midgut. Once grown, the oocyte ruptures and releases sporozoites into the salivary glands of the mosquito. The process then repeats itself through the human host if the mosquito lives long enough to infect a human. Vectors *Anopheles balabacensis *Anopheles freeborni *Anopheles hackeri *Anopheles maculatus Clinical Features When infected with P. coatneyi, the host shows the general symptoms of malaria are fever, headache, chills, vomiting, diarrhea, jaundice, joint pain and anemia. These symptoms occur in the form of paroxysmal attacks, which is a sudden increase of these symptoms after a period of remission. This is due to the release of merozoites from schizonts inside the red blood cells. This cyclic cycle occurs every other day when infected with P. coatneyi, a tertiary periodicity. This is compared to the quartan periodicity shown in some other Plasmodium species, such as P. knowlesi which occurs every three days. P. coatneyi, unlike many other species in the genus Plasmodium, is a cause of cerebral malaria. The symptoms of this severe form of malaria include impaired consciousness such as a coma, seizures, brain swelling, intracranial hypertension, and other neurological abnormalities. While the exact mechanism for cerebral malaria is not known, the most commonly used explanation is the sequestration of the protozoan infected erythrocytes in the microvasculature of the brain. Due to the fact that it is species of Plasmodium which only causes malaria in nonhuman primates, no treatment for this form of malaria has been specifically adapted. However, treatment with subcurative levels of artemether has been shown to reduce symptoms. This used to treat P. falciparum, and is grouped into artemisinin-based combination therapies used most for P. falciparum treatment. Use as a Model Organism While more closely related to Plasmodium vivax than to P. falciparum, P. coatneyi has been used as a model organism for P. falciparum in a model organism for humans, rhesus macaques. This is due to the several similarities that P. coatneyi and P. falciparum have in common. These similarities includes having a tertiary periodicity, causing cerebral malaria, causing knob protrusion on the surface of infected red blood cells, and adhering the red blood cells to the same sites of the endothelium. Because of these similarities, experiments have been run to further research the mechanism(s) for cerebral malaria. On a broader scale, P. coatneyi can cause metabolic dysfunction, coagulopathy, and anemia very close to that found in humans. Therefore, P.coatneyi was predicted to be able to test pathophysiological interactions between the parasite and its host. This can be used to mimic the conditions of a human with malaria, allowing for testing without any sort of human exposure taking place.

Biography  Fran√ßois-Henri de Virieu was born in Paris, son of the marquis Xavier de Virieu (1898‚Äì1953), colonel who was known for his acts of resistance during the Maquis du Vercors, and of Marie-Fran√ßoise de Brugi√®re de Barante (1906‚Äì2004). He graduated with a degree of agricultural engineering at the √âcole Sup√©rieure d'Agriculture in Angers. Five centuries before, Jean de Fay, seigneur de Virieu, one of his ancestors, was already interested in agriculture and accepted to convert to Roman Catholicism to protect the Italian immigrant Pierre Benay who imported from Bologne silk mills for the weavers of Lyon. Fran√ßois-Henri de Virieu comes from a very ancient family of the French nobility. His is also the direct descendant of Fran√ßois Henri, comte de Virieu (1754‚Äì1793).  Journalism career = Economic journalist at Le Monde  Fran√ßois-Henri de Virieu began as an advisor for agricultural cooperatives. He became in 1956 an editor-in-chief for publications of the Centre d'√âtudes des Techniques Agricoles. He was attached at the Institut d'Organisation Scientifique du Travail Agricole as an agricultural advisor. As a great-grandson of one of the founders Le P√®lerin, he presents himself at La Croix, but despite the great welcome of Jean G√©lamur, he prefers to attempt his chance at Le Monde where the contact with Hubert Beuve-M√©ry is promoted due to the same belonging of this one at the same resistance field of the one that belonged his father. Fran√ßois-Henri de Virieu did not wait less than six months to publish his first article. He officially joined the newspaper in July 1958 with an internship in agricultural affairs, during a productive period of agricultural manifestations, with negotiations of the Single market and reforms from the ministry of Edgard Pisani. He later published his first book La Fin d'une agriculture (1967) and also collaborates at the same time at different regional publications. In 1968, he was named chief of the department for social affairs in the economic service.  Chief editor of the daily news  In November 1969, becoming the same time a member of the French Democratic Confederation of Labour, he joined the OFRT as the chief of the political, economic and social service of Information Premi√®re. Assisted by young collaborators like Guy Claisse, Herv√© Chabalier and Bernard Langlois, he became the editor-in-chief of the daily news in 1970. But the acknowledgement of Pierre Desgraupes in July 1972 forces him to leave the television field and become the director of the news service at Informations, the weekly news program in which he became one of the columnists since 1969. He then became unemployed in 1973 after its failure and published the same year Lip : 100 000 montres sans patron.  Chief editor of Le Matin de Paris (1977‚Äì81)  In 1973, he joined the Socialist Party before joining the next year the political service of Le Nouvel Observateur. After the refuse of Pierre Viansson-Pont√© for becoming the editor-in-chief in October 1976, he became the editor-in- chief of the daily newspaper Le Matin de Paris. He then left the Socialist Party the same year to engage his support for the Union of the Left, and after its failure in September 1977, for the Socialist Party. In the meantime, he was in charge of the economic supplement and editor-in-chief of the weekly economic newspaper La Presse √©conomique (1979‚Äì80). But in September 1980, he was in conflict with Claude Perdriel, whom the authoritarianism, omnipotence and interventionism in his redactional activity considerably reduced his authority. He then became editor-in-chief of the economic supplement, where he collaborates with journalist Pierre Largue, who served as a shifter between Fran√ßois-Henri de Virieu and the typographic workers.  Presenter of L'Heure de v√©rit√©  Since August 1981, he decided to join Antenne 2 where the new project proposed him the direction of the news. He published the same year a book about this subject titled Le Nouveau Pouvoir. His functions ended in September 1982 in the demand of the redaction, and he became director of the international relations of the channel before starting to present in May 1982 the political television program L'Heure de v√©rit√© until 1995.  Personal life and death  Fran√ßois-Henri de Virieu married Marie-Claude Emy and had five children, Isabelle de Virieu (born in 1960), St√©phanie de Virieu (born in 1962), Guillaume de Virieu, marquis de Virieu (1964), √âtienne de Virieu, comte de Virieu (1969‚Äì2011) and Nicolas de Virieu, comte de Virieu (born in 1975).

Since its launch, the programme has been produced at ITV Yorkshire's main studios in Kirkstall Road, Leeds. Calendar's first presenter was Jonathan Aitken. In later years, it was hosted by Richard Whiteley (until 1995, alongside his duties on Countdown, earning him the nickname \\"Twice Nightly Whiteley\\"), Austin Mitchell (until he became a Labour Member of Parliament in 1977), Marylyn Webb,Marylyn Webb Obituary 3 July 2014 http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/community/obituaries/marylyn- webb-1-6708847 Christa Ackroyd and Mike Morris. Upon gaining the Belmont transmitter in 1974 from Anglia Television, which served south Lincolnshire and north Norfolk, the programme developed a regional opt-out service for the area within the main programme. At the same time, Yorkshire Television inherited the Anglia news offices in Grimsby and Hull and opened a further newsroom in Lincoln. For several years until the early 1980s, viewers served by the Belmont transmitter also received a localised weather forecast produced by the weather department at Anglia. On 28 March 1977, Yorkshire Television launched a six-week breakfast television experiment.Yorkshire's forthcoming experiment in breakfast viewing may sound the ... Fiddick, Peter The Guardian (1959‚Äì2003); 21 February 1977; Good Morning Calendar (a name later reused for its regional news programme in Good Morning Britain) is credited as being the United Kingdom's first breakfast television programme, six years before the launch of the BBC's Breakfast Time. The programme ran concurrently with a similar ITV Tyne Tees programme, Good Morning North for North East viewers. Both series ended after nine weeks on 27 May 1977. During the 1970s and early 1980s, Calendar's output consisted of a main evening programme alongside lunchtime and late night bulletins on weekdays; weekend bulletins were not introduced until the late 1980s. When ITV Schools programming was moved to Channel 4 in 1987 and daytime programming introduced to ITV, national ITN and regional bulletins were introduced at 9:25am and 11am, along with a mid- afternoon bulletin. In the latter part of the 1980s, ITV News Calendar expanded its lunchtime bulletin into a half-hour magazine show, Calendar Lunchtime Live. The programme was scrapped in early 1988 but reintroduced for a short period during 2001. For over twenty years from June 1990, Calendar was produced and broadcast from a dedicated news centre and studio facility based in a converted roller rink opposite the main complex on Kirkstall Road. On Monday 24 September 1990, a third sub-regional opt-out for south Yorkshire and north Derbyshire was introduced ‚Äì \\"South\\" from Sheffield initially aired at lunchtime and within the main 6pm programme while \\"East\\" (Hull) aired in east Yorkshire, Lincolnshire and North Norfolk and Calendar News was broadcast to the rest of the region (west and north Yorkshire). The separate East and South services continued until December 2006. The newsgathering and production teams at Calendar were the subject of a 1995 fly-on-the-wall Channel 4 documentary series, Deadline. January 2007 to February 2009 On Monday, 8 January 2007, Calendar's main 6pm programme was split into North and South editions for the region. All other bulletins (weekday and weekend lunchtime, weekday late, and weekend early evening) were pan-regional. The previous \\"East\\" and \\"South\\" regions were merged to form a larger \\"South\\" area. \\"North\\" (north, west, and south west Yorkshire; north Derbyshire) \\"South\\" (central and east Lincolnshire; east and south east Yorkshire; east Nottinghamshire; north Norfolk).

Beginning with the correspondence between Walter Benjamin and Gershom Scholem (or possibly before that, when Martin Buber became one of Franz Kafka's first publishers) interpretations, speculations, and reactions to Kafka's Judaism became so substantial during the 20th century as to virtually constitute an entire minor literature. Meditations about how and to what extent Kafka anticipated or represented the incoming Holocaust of the European Jewry comprise a major component of most scholarship along these lines. Kafka and Jewish mysticism Shortly after he began to write The Castle (which he never finished), Kafka wrote in his diary that he had \\"suffered something very like a breakdown.\\" Near the end of the entry he wrote: \\"All such writing is an assault on all frontiers...it might easily have developed into a new secret doctrine, a Kabbalah. There are intimations of this. Though of course it would require genius of an unimaginable kind to strike root again in old centuries, or create the old centuries anew and not spend itself withal, but only then begin to flower forth.\\"Franz Kafka. \\"January 16th, 1922. \\"Diaries 1910‚Äì1923. Page 399 Though his diaries were not published until 1948, there was a small but intense vortex of discussion about Kafka as a kind of 'secular Jewish mystic.' Kafka became the object of inquiry and discussion in a correspondence between two German-Jewish intellectuals who are themselves often considered 20th century mystics: Walter Benjamin and Gershom Scholem. In 1937, Scholem who is generally acknowledged to be the founder of modern, academic study of the Kabbalah, wrote about Kafka in a letter to Salman Schocken. Scholem claimed that when he read the Czech author alongside the Pentateuch and the Talmud during a period of intensive study and feelings of 'the most rationalistic skepticism' about his area of study, \\"I [found in Kafka] the most perfect and unsurpassed expression of this fine line [between religion and nihilism] an expression which, as a secular statement of the Kabbalistic world-feeling in a modern spirit, seemed to me to wrap Kafka's writings in the halo of the canonical.\\"Biale, David. \\"A Letter from Gershom Scholem to Zalman Schocken, 1937.\\" Gershom Scholem: Kabbalah and Counter- History. Page 32. Scholem sent this letter to Schocken from Berlin to Jerusalem‚Äîwhere Scholem was shortly to follow after his publisher, as Nazi aggression in his homeland continued to ramp up before the advent of World War II. In the following year, between the Anschluss and the crossing of the Vistula on June 12 of 1938, Benjamin wrote to Scholem from Europe: > The long and the short of it is that apparently an appeal had to be made to > the forces of this [ancient, naive mystical] tradition if an individual (by > the name of Franz Kafka) was to be confronted with that reality of ours > which realizes itself theoretically, for example, in modern (quantum and > relativistic) physics, and practically in the technology of modem warfare. > What I mean to say is that this reality can virtually no longer be > experienced by an individual, and that Kafka's world, frequently of such > playfulness and interlaced with angels, is the exact complement of his era > which is preparing to do away with the inhabitants of this planet on a > considerable scale. The experience which corresponds to that of Kafka, the > private individual, will probably not become accessible to the masses until > such time as they are being done away with.Walter Benjamin. \\"Some > Reflections on Kafka,\\"(from a letter to Gershom Scholem June 12th 1938). > Illuminations. 142‚Äì143 Gershom Scholem was not alone among thinking people when he later read these lines as having some prophetic significance in respect to the onrushing disaster which befell the Jews in the European Holocaust.George Steiner. \\"Introduction by George Steiner.\\" The Trial (by Franz Kafka). Kafka and the Holocaust George Steiner writes in his introduction to The Trial: \\"Kafka's In the Penal Colony, his play on 'vermin' and annihilation in The Metamorphosis were actualized shortly after his death. A concrete fulfillment of augury, of detailed clairvoyance, attaches to his seeming fantastications.... Kafka's Milena and his three sisters died in the camps. The central European Jewish world which Kafka ironized and celebrated went to hideous extinction. The spiritual possibility exists that Franz Kafka experienced his prophetic powers as some visitation of guilt.\\"George Steiner. \\"Introduction by George Steiner.\\" The Trial(by Franz Kafka). Steiner goes on to claim that Kafka's tortured struggle with the German language derives from hearing in its cadences the oncoming violence which was about to overwhelm and destroy the German-Jewish milieu in which Kafka had grown up: > German is the language which formulated Jew-hating obscenities and a will to > annihilation without precedent. It unleashed from within itself the > bellowing of the inhuman while, at the same time, laying claim to its > eminent philosophic literary heritage and while continuing at many levels > and in the domesticities of the every day, to function normally. The... > dilemma has its premonitory antecedent in Kafka's torment over a 'false > mother tongue'.George Steiner. \\"Grammars of Creation\\". Page 199. New Haven > and London: 2001. This latter suspicion seems to be well-founded based on a variety of passages from Kafka's diaries and letters. He wrote in his diary,\\"Yesterday it occurred to me that I did not always love my mother as she deserved and as I could, only because the German language prevented it.\\"Franz Kafka. Diaries 1910‚Äì1923. New York, NY: Schocken Books, 1976. Page 113. And, in his notorious diagnosis of the struggle of the German-Jewish writer, he wrote to Max Brod, \\"[The Jewish writers] live beset by three impossibilities: the impossibility of not writing, the impossibility of writing in German and the impossibility of writing differently, and we could add a fourth impossibility: the impossibility of writing at all.\\" Bibliography *\\"Franz Kafka\\" from Illuminations by Walter Benjamin *\\"Notes on Kafka\\" from Prisms by Theodor Adorno *Writing of the Disaster by Maurice Blanchot. *\\"Guilt and Guilt Feelings\\" by Martin Buber. *The Correspondence of Walter Benjamin, 1910‚Äì1940, by Walter Benjamin, Gershom Scholem, and Theodor Adorno *\\"Franz Kafka: The Jewish Patient\\" by Sander Gilman. *Burnt Books by Rodger Kamenetz *\\"Ten Unhistorical Aphorisms\\" by Gershom Scholem.

Known originally as a train station at Powlett River near Wonthaggi, it is now the location of the Victorian Desalination Plant, and at the 2011 census, it had a population of 606. It's Bass Coast‚Äôs fastest-growing suburb, with the 2011 census showing Dalyston‚Äôs population more than doubled from 278 residents in 2006 to 606 in 2011. Today=Victorian Desalination Plant Victorian Desalination Plant, Lower Powlett Road The Victorian Desalination Plant is a water desalination plant on the Bass Coast in Dalyston, completed in December 2012 on Lower Powlett Road. The plant is an integral part of Victoria's water system, supplying water via a series of pipelines. As a rainfall-independent source of water it complements Victoria's existing drainage basins. It produces high quality water. It is a useful resource in times of drought. Booked tours are run and plans are underway for Aquasure to open to the public. The gates open daily for public access to the 225-hectare park and 8 kilometres of walking, horse riding and cycling tracks. The plant is located next to Williamsons Beach and the Wonthaggi Wind Farm. 6 Turbine Wonthaggi Wind Farm From Lower Powlett Road Bass Coast Rail Trail Walking, cycling and horse trotting is the modern use of the old Wonthaggi railway line all year round. It is very flat and begins at Murray Street in Wonthaggi, goes through Dalyston and ends at the roundabout to Phillip Island. It goes through Dalyston at the end of Daly Street, where it crosses over the Powlett River and continues to the right for 2.7 kilometres to go over Bourne Creek trestle bridge at Kilcunda, which has panoramic views of the beach. Kangaroos can often be spotted as well as many bird species. Victoria‚Äôs only coastal rail trail, it stretches 16 kilometres from Wonthaggi to Anderson, meandering through farmland, coastal bushland, historic coal mining nature reserves and coastline with a clear view of the Wonthaggi wind turbines and remnants of coal mine buildings. An extension of the trail from Anderson to Woolamai, on Phillip Island, has not yet been made suitable for cyclists. Public toilets are situated at each town along the way. Public toilets in Anderson are situated at the bus interchange which handles connections between the San Remo and Inverloch/Wonthaggi public transport routes. The bus interchange is adjacent to the Eastern side of the Anderson roundabout. Powlett River Powlett River mouth is located next to Williamsons Beach. On Mouth Of Powlett Road there is a path leading to both. Powlett River mouth is located in the province of Kilcunda. Powlett River riparian and wetland is an estuary of national importance due to its ecological values. It is located alongside fertile agricultural land. Powlett River is named after Frederick Powlett, the Commissioner of the Western Port District in 1840 , cited in Bird (2006) Path To Powlett River And Williamsons Beach, Mouth Of Powlett Road Ozone Hotel One of Victoria's original pubs, the Ozone Hotel on the Bass Highway has been a pub and restaurant/functions venue in its current premises since 1901. Old Dalyston Deli Dalyston Church, built in 1901 on Glen Forbes Road, is now run as a cafe/restaurant and functions venue. Climate Dalyston's location on the north shore of Bass Strait gives it an oceanic climate, with the moderating effect of the ocean allowing a narrower temperature range throughout the year compared to other regions in Victoria. Average daily maximum temperatures range from 23.5 ¬∞C in summer to 13.5 in winter. Frost is rare, occurring on average 6 mornings a year. History The Bunurong aboriginal people were custodians of this stretch of coast for thousands of years prior to white settlement. The Boakoolawal clan lived in the Kilcunda area south of the Bass River, and the Yowenjerre were west of the Tarwin River along what is now the Bunurong Marine and Coastal Park. Middens containing charcoal and shellfish mark the location of their campsites along the coast. Eventually known as ‚ÄòPrice‚Äôs Corner; Dalyston was first settled by the Price family in 1856. Then in 1880 John Daly came to the district. At that time the nearest railway station was at Dandenong. John Daly built a 40 room hotel at ‚ÄòPowlett Crossing‚Äô and this license was surrendered to the current ‚ÄòOzone Hotel‚Äô in 1901. The Daly family owned most of the land in the area and subdivided land around the town for business sites. The town became known as Dalyston (Daly's town) because of the Daly family and when the railway station had to have a name, Dalyston was chosen. Dalyston station was on the Wonthaggi railway line along the Bass Coast, Victoria. Its primary purpose was to serve the State Coal Mine on what were then known as the Powlett River Coalfields. The line also provided passenger and general goods services. The station train operated from 1910 until the line's closure in 1978. Today there is almost no trace left of Dalyston Station; the site of the station is now part of the Bass Coast Rail Trail. Education Dalyston has one primary school, Powlett River Primary, with forty-two students in 2018. Children attend secondary college in nearby Wonthaggi or on Phillip Island. Also in Wonthaggi; Chisholm TAFE, Bass Coast Specialist School, Bass Coast Adult Education Centre, University of the Third Age (U3A) retirees education centre. and Connecting Skills Australia (CSA) specialist developmental school, support and employment services/training.

The Long Water refers to the long and narrow western half of the lake that is known as the Serpentine. Serpentine Bridge, which marks the boundary between Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens, also marks the Long Water's eastern boundary. The Long Water and the Serpentine are generally considered to be part of one lake.  Geography  Originally the lake was fed by the River Westbourne entering at the Italian Garden at the north-western end of the Long Water. The Westbourne ceased to provide the water for the Serpentine in 1834, as the river had become polluted, and so water was then pumped from the Thames. The water is now supplied by three boreholes drilled into the Upper Chalk. The first borehole is located at the Italian Gardens, the second at the Diana Memorial and the third, drilled in 2012 to a depth of 132m, is within 50m of the Diana Memorial. The Long Water runs south-east from this point to Serpentine Bridge, where the lake curves to the east, following the natural contours of the land. At the eastern end, water flows out of the lake via a sluice in the dam, forming a small ornamental waterfall at the Dell. The outflow has not historically maintained the waterfall, and re-circulation pumps were installed in the Dell, below the dam, to sustain this feature. The restoration work in 2012 restored the flows into the Serpentine and this waterfall is now restored as originally designed. Historically the river flowed due south from this point, marking the boundary between Westminster and Kensington, but since 1850 it has been diverted into a culvert, running underground to reach the Thames near Chelsea Bridge. The lake as a whole (including the Serpentine) has a maximum depth of 17 feet (5.3 m). The lake is often reported to be deeper, but bathymetric surveys by the Royal Park in 2010 revealed the design of the lake.  History  1746 Rocque map showing the newly constructed Serpentine. The paths converging on the Round Pond to the west of the lake are also visible. In 1730 Queen Caroline, wife of George II, ordered the damming of the River Westbourne in Hyde Park as part of a general redevelopment of Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens. Original monastic ponds may have existed in the location; these were modified as part of the 1730‚Äì1732 scheme to create a single lake. At that time, the Westbourne formed eleven natural ponds in the park. During the 1730s, the lake filled to its current size and shape. The redevelopment was carried out by Royal Gardener Charles Bridgeman, who dammed the Westbourne to create the artificial lake, and dug a large pond in the centre of Kensington Gardens (The Round Pond) to be a focal point for pathways in the park. At the time of construction, artificial lakes were typically long and straight. The Serpentine was one of the earliest artificial lakes designed to appear natural, and was widely imitated in parks and gardens nationwide. The lake achieved notoriety in December 1816 when Harriet Westbrook, the pregnant wife of the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, was found drowned in the Serpentine having left a suicide note addressed to her father, sister and husband. Shelley married Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin less than two weeks later. Serpentine Bridge The lake formed a focal point of the 1814 celebrations which marked a century of Hanoverian rule and re-enacted the British victory at Trafalgar nine years previously, and of the 1851 Great Exhibition, with the Crystal Palace standing on its southern shore. Following the introduction of more stringent regulations to protect the environment in the park, the relocation of the Crystal Palace, and the construction of the nearby Albertopolis complex of museums and exhibitions, large-scale events ceased to take place on the banks of the Serpentine. However, it was the location for the 1977 Silver Jubilee celebrations, and a venue for the 2012 Olympics. In the 1820s, the park was extensively redesigned by Decimus Burton. At the same time, John Rennie built the Serpentine Bridge to carry the newly built West Carriage Drive along the boundary between Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens, dividing the lake into the Serpentine (east) and the Long Water (west).  Environs  Lansbury's Lido At the northern end of the Long Water are five fountains surrounded by classical statuary and sculpture in an area officially known as the Italian Gardens. A large bronze memorial to Edward Jenner, the developer of modern vaccination, dominates the area; it was originally located in Trafalgar Square in 1858, but four years later was moved to its present site. In recent years there has been an ongoing campaign for the memorial to be moved to the empty plinth in Trafalgar Square. The Long Water is designated as a bird sanctuary.

Van Buren St. in the Loop neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois. The building, which opened in 1930, has historically served as a mixed-use retail and office building. Chicago architects Holabird and Root designed the building in the Art Deco style. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 10, 2000. History Construction plans for the Buckingham Building began in 1929. The building replaced an 1886 structure called the Athenaeum Building, a semi-public educational institution. As a result, the new building was called the New Athenaeum during its initial planning, though by 1929 it was known as the Buckingham Building. The building's office space opened to tenants in May 1930; its leasing agents promoted the space using both its proximity to Michigan Avenue and multiple modes of transportation and its views of Lake Michigan and Grant Park. Significant early tenants of the building included the Vacuum Oil Company, the American Railroad Association, and the National Hardwood Lumber Association. The first floor of the building was used as retail space, housing shops and restaurants. The Vacuum Oil Company merged with the Standard Oil Company of New York in 1931 to become the Socony-Vacuum Company, and the consolidated firm rented increasingly more space in the building. By 1940, the firm renamed the building the Socony-Vacuum Building upon signing a ten-year lease to its office space. The building later became known by its street address. It still includes both retail and office space, though it is now only partially occupied. Architecture Chicago architects Holabird and Root, the successors to Chicago school pioneers Holabird and Roche, designed the Buckingham Building. The firm designed the building in the Art Deco style. The building has a concrete and steel frame, and its exterior is faced in brick, granite, and terra cotta. The front facade is composed of five bays divided by piers; the three central bays are faced with dark terra cotta to add vertical emphasis to the lighter piers. Floral-patterned spandrels separate each story's windows on the central bays. The first three floors are faced in black granite, and the storefronts are framed by dentillated aluminum. The twenty-second floor features decorative chocolate- colored terra cotta panels with a floral design, while the twenty-fifth floor has additional terra cotta decorations with a keystone motif.

It has been a subject in Serbian folklore and literary tradition and has been cultivated oral epic poetry and guslar poems. The final form of the legend was not created immediately after the battle but evolved from different originators into various versions. In its modern form it emerged in 19th-century Serbia and served as an important constitutive element of the national identity of modern Serbia and its politics, and in certain periods of other South Slavic nations. The Serbian ruler Lazar was challenged by the Ottoman Sultan Murad I to the battle on the Kosovo Polje. According to the Myth, Lazar chose to die as a martyr, with the aim of providing Serbs with a place in the Kingdom of Heaven, instead of the ‚Äúearthly kingdom‚Äù and victory in the battle. Vuk Brankoviƒá withdrew his troops at crucial moments, thus becoming a symbol of a betrayal, while Milo≈° Obiliƒá assassinated the Sultan Murad I and then was executed. In Ottoman Serbia, the myth was interpreted as an ideological acceptance of the Ottoman Empire and originally was not linked to the Serbs as a people, but to the downfall of Serbian feudal society. In the modern narratives of the myth, defeat in battle was characterized as the downfall of the glorious medieval Serbian state and subsequent a long-lasting Ottoman occupation and slavery. Legend has it that the sacrifice of Lazar and his knights resulted in the defeat, while the Serbs were presented as the chosen people who signed a Covenant with God. The Kosovo Myth is modeled on well-known Christian symbols, such as the biblical Last Supper, Judas' betrayal and numbers that have religious associations. It pictures Serbia as Antemurale Christianitatis (Bulwark of Christianity). One of the earliest records that contributed to the cult of Lazar's martyrdom was found in the Serbian Orthodox Church, primarily written by Danilo III, Serbian Patriarch (1390‚Äì1396) and a nun Jefimija. Over the following centuries, many writers and chroniclers wrote down the oral legends they heard in the Balkans. In 1601, Ragusan chronicler Mavro Orbini published the Kingdom of the Slavs, which was important for the reconstruction and development of the myth, combining the records of historians and folk legends, while the Trono≈°a Chronicle (1791) also significantly contributed to the preservation of the legend. The development of myth was also influenced by French chanson de geste. The final form of the Kosovo Myth was constructed by philologist Vuk Karad≈æiƒá, who published the ‚ÄúKosovo Cycle‚Äù after collecting traditional epic poems. Many South Slavic literary and visual artists were influenced by Kosovo legends, including some highly internationally recognized. The most significant ones who have perpetuated the Kosovo Myth are the poet Petar II Petroviƒá-Njego≈° with his epic drama The Mountain Wreath (1847) and the sculptor Ivan Me≈°troviƒá, while one of the main artistic representation is the painting Kosovo Maiden (1919) by Uro≈° Prediƒá. Since its establishment, the myth and its poetic, literary, religious, and philosophical exposition was intertwined with political and ideological agendas. It became a central myth of Serbian nationalism used in the 19th century, and its importance was especially raised since the Congress of Berlin (1878). The myth was significant among other South Slavic nations, primarily in Montenegro and among the advocates of the unification of Yugoslavia. It was evoked at times of major historic events such as the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, World War I, creation of Yugoslavia, Yugoslav coup d'√©tat, and especially to create a Serbian victimization narrative during the rise of Serbian nationalism in 1980s, the breakup of Yugoslavia and Kosovo War.  Overview  The Gazimestan memorial site commemorating the Battle of Kosovo covered by an image of Lazar of Serbia The central events in the myth are related to the Battle of Kosovo that took place in 1389, about which numerous details are not actually known. According to legend, the Serbian ruler Lazar, who was referred to as Tsar (‚ÄúEmperor‚Äù) Lazar, was offered an ultimatum to pay homage to the Ottoman Sultan Murad I, leaving the control of Serbian lands to the sultan and taxation, or to lead his army into the battle on the Kosovo Polje. On the last supper before the battle hosted by Lazar, he told his knights that one of them would betray him. Deceived by his son-in-law Vuk Brankoviƒá, he accused Milo≈° Obiliƒá, which Obiliƒá opposed, claiming that he would kill the Sultan Mur–∞d I. Per legend, Lazar was visited the night before battle by a grey hawk or falcon from Jerusalem who offered a choice between an ‚Äúearthly kingdom‚Äù, implying victory at the Battle, or the Kingdom of Heaven, where the Serbs would be defeated. It is sometimes said that the Prophet Elijah appeared in the form of a falcon. Lazar chose to die as a martyr, thus achieving a special status for Serbs as a heavenly people. The warriors accepted his words, stating that the Serbs would get freedom in heaven, but that they would never be enslaved. Lazar also cursed those Serbs who refuse to join him on the battlefield. He and the Serbian army received communion in the Church of St John the Baptist in Samodre≈æa. The battle took place on the Christian St. Vitus Day, known in Serbia as Vidovdan. After an agreement with the Sultan, in order to preserve his positions, Vuk Brankoviƒá withdrew his troops at crucial moments of the battle, thus becoming symbol of a betrayal. Pretending to surrender after the abandon of Lazar, Obiliƒá came to the sultan's tent and after kneeling to allegedly kiss Murad's feet, took out a dagger and mortally wounded him. The dying sultan ordered Obiliƒá's execution, while this sacrifice showed his loyalty to Lazar and heroism. Milo≈° Obiliƒá assassinated Murad I, illustration from the German version of the Present State of the Ottoman Empire (1694) by Paul Rycaut On the other hand, Lazar was captured by Ottoman Turks and beheaded. The sacrifice of Lazar and his knights for the sake of the Kingdom of Heaven resulted in the defeat of the Serbian army by the Turks, while the Serbs were presented as the chosen people who signed a Covenant with God. Other famous knights who, according to legends, took part in the battle are Milan Toplica, Ivan Kosanƒçiƒá, Pavle Orloviƒá, Stevo Vasojeviƒá and the Musiƒá brothers. There are also key female characters in the Kosovo Myth, which symbolize the great losses and isolation in which Serbs, especially women, lived during Ottoman rule. Princess Milica, who was referred to as Tsaritsa (‚ÄúEmpress‚Äù) Milica, was Lazar's wife and member of the Nemanjiƒá dynasty. She begged Lazar to keep his youngest brother Bo≈°ko so that one of the nine Jugoviƒá brothers would surely survive, which Bo≈°ko himself refused and then became a flag-bearer during the battle. Their mother died of a broken heart after losing all nine sons in battle. Another female character a Kosovo Maiden, a girl who came to Kosovo Polje the morning after the battle and cared for the wounded Serbian warriors, giving them water and wine. Defeat in battle was characterized as the downfall of the glorious medieval Serbian state and subsequent a long-lasting Ottoman occupation and slavery. In the Serbian tradition, the red color of the Paeonia peregrina has become a symbol of ‚Äúbloodshed in the Battle of Kosovo‚Äù. Also, birds often appear in the legend, which should symbolize the connection between the earth and the heaven. Ravens can speak and play the role of messengers, and so were swallows. The mother of nine Jugoviƒá asked God for ‚Äúeyes of a falcon, white wings of a swan‚Äù which was fulfilled for her, so she could fly over the battlefield and see her sons and husband fighting. Then, the raven gave her a confirmation of the death of her family members. In addition to the transformation of Elijah, the falcon represented warriors. Contrary to common symbols, doves were called cowardly and weak enemies, and eagles were depicted as scavengers the flesh of the victims.  The basic elements of the myth  Ljubinka Trgovƒçeviƒá described the elements and symbolism of the myth: Prince's Supper (1871) by Adam Stefanoviƒá and Pavle ƒåortanoviƒá; Many parts of the myth are modeled on well- known Christian symbols, such as the Last Supper and Judas' betrayal * Vengeance ‚Äì to restore the Serbian medieval state on the territories where it once existed * Martyrdom ‚Äì to sacrifice for freedom and faith * Betrayal ‚Äì justifies defeat and warns those who do not support the Serbian cause, such as Vuk Brankoviƒá * Glory ‚Äì those who sacrifice themselves are promised \\"the kingdom of heaven\\" and eternal glory, such as Lazar and Milo≈° Obiliƒá Many parts and characters in the myth are modeled on well-known Christian symbols. While Lazar is portrayed as Jesus and faith, the dinner that he headed the night before the battle has the attributes of the biblical Last Supper, including the presence of his disciples and Vuk Brankoviƒá, the traitor or Judas figure. Like Jesus, Lazar died so that his people could live. Also, numbers that have religious associations such as Twelve Apostles and Trinity are often used in the legend. The Kosovo Myth presents the battle as \\"a titanic contest between Christian Europe and the Islamic East\\" in which Lazar renounced \\"the earthly kingdom for a heavenly one\\". The Kosovo Myth pictures Serbia as Antemurale Christianitatis (Bulwark of Christianity), similarly to constructions of the other nations in the Balkans. It is sometimes propagated to evoke a sense of pride and national grievance among Serbs. Since the battle on Kosovo Polje, this hill came to be seen as the ‚Äúcradle of Serbia‚Äù and one of the most Serb nation‚Äôs most holy places. Sabrina P. Ramet compared the myths about Lazar with the myths about the knighthood of the King Arthur and the martyrdom of Olaf II of Norway, as well as the legends about Stephen I of Hungary. Gerlachlus Duijzings noted that, in a similar way, Naim Frash√´ri tried through Bektashism to promote the Battle of Karbala myth among Albanians as a source of inspiration in the struggle against Ottoman domination, although that myth has a similar contest and style as the Serbian-Orthodox Kosovo Myth.  Sources and development  The Kosovo Myth has for a long time been a central subject in Serbian folklore and Serbian literary tradition, and for centuries was cultivated mostly in the form of oral epic poetry and guslar poems. The mythologization of the battle occurred shortly after the event. The legend was not fully formed immediately after the battle but evolved from different originators into various versions. Many sources from 14th to 18th century have preserved oral narration of the Kosovo Battle, such as chronicles, genealogies, annals, religious cult texts and travellers‚Äô tales. Epic poetry was well developed among Serbs and represented a cultural source of pride, identity and a strong connection to the past. One of the earliest records that contributed to the development of the cult of martyrdom and God's special favor for Lazar are the Narration about Prince Lazar by Danilo III, Serbian Patriarch (1390‚Äì1396), and the Encomium of Prince Lazar by a nun Jefimija, a widow of the despot Uglje≈°a Mrnjavƒçeviƒá. The Encomium of Prince Lazar (14th century) by Jefimija The first Serbian record of the assassination of the Ottoman Sultan Murad I was the Life of Despot Stefan Lazareviƒá by Constantine of Kostenets, although the name of the executor was not mentioned. The heroic image of the Battle of Kosovo and the cult of Lazar's martyrdom has lost its force over time. The epic expression of the Battle was cultivated in the emigration of Serbs to the mountainous regions of Old Serbia, Montenegro and Herzegovina. Following the Fall of Constantinople (1453), three thousand Serbs began a nomadic life. In these regions, the image of the Kosovo hero was cultivated and preserved. The figure of Murad's assassin probably originated in the culture of exile, where his heroic deed could inspire constant resistance to the Turks. A Byzantine historians from the 15th century, Doukas and Laonikos Chalkokondyles also wrote about the Battle and about ‚Äúsacrifice of a Christian nobleman who killed the Sultan in his tent‚Äù. Serbian soldier and author of a memoir Konstantin Mihailoviƒá was the first to mention the name of Milo≈° Obiliƒá in his work the Memoirs of a Janissary (ca. 1497), while he also described the betrayal of Vuk Brankoviƒá. An anonymous resident of Dubrovnik or Dalmatia translated Doukas' parts about the Battle of Kosovo, citing the moment of the betrayal, but attributed it to Dragoslav Pribi≈°iƒá. Italian literature and popular poetry in Republic of Ragusa influenced educated Serbian exiles to produce the first bugar≈°tice based on the accumulation of oral history in the late 15th century. Some of the bugar≈°tice cultivated the Kosovo Legend. According to Miodrag Popoviƒá, in the Ottoman Serbia of the 16th and 17th century, the local population was \\"Turkophilic\\" in accordance with the general climate of necessary adaptation to Ottoman rule. –¢hey did not give the legend of the Battle of Kosovo an interpretation unfavorable or hostile to the Ottoman Turks. During the 16th century, Benedikt Kuripeƒçiƒç wrote a travel description of the Balkans and recorded the legends he heard, including Lazar's Last Supper and Obiliƒá's heroism. The Illustrated Chronicle of Ivan the Terrible (1567) contains nine miniatures about the events from the Kosovo legends, mostly related to the battle. In 1601, Ragusan chronicler Mavro Orbini published the Kingdom of the Slavs in Italian, which was important for the reconstruction and development of the myth, combining the records of historians and folk legends. Renaissance tapestry with motifs of the Battle of Kosovo (16th century) in the Ch√¢teau de Chenonceau, France. The development of myth structure was also influenced by French chanson de geste. In the following period, many stories were published by anonymous authors in Ragusa and Bay of Kotor, the most significant and most comprehensive was the Life of Prince Lazar, also known as the Tale of the Battle of Kosovo, from the beginning of the 18th century. At the request of Peter the Great, Russian Emperor, a diplomat Sava Vladislavich translated the Orbini's Kingdom of the Slavs into Russian in 1722. In the middle of the 18th century, under the influence of previous manuscripts, the Trono≈°a Chronicle (1791) was compiled which contributed to the further preservation of the Kosovo legend. Characters of the myth have been also recorded in the works of ƒêorƒëe Brankoviƒá, Vasilije Petroviƒá and Pavle Julinac. During the 18th century, anti-Ottoman sentiments increased, and more comprehensive Kosovo legend became an integral part of the oral tradition. During the First Serbian Uprising (1804‚Äì1813), a fresco of Milo≈° as a haloed, sword-bearing saint was painted in Lazar's narthex in the Hilandar Monastery on Mount Athos, Greece. Philologist Vuk Karad≈æiƒá collected traditional epic poems related to the topic of the Battle of Kosovo and released the so-called ‚ÄúKosovo cycle‚Äù, which became the final version of the transformation of the myth. Karad≈æiƒá's work was influenced by Jernej Kopitar, who introduced him to the literature of Romantic nationalism, as well as by Jacob Grimm, who became his reviewer and translator. Kopitar‚Äôs ideology was rooted in Herder's view that each group possesses a unique culture that manifests itself through the language and tradition of the common people. Karad≈æiƒá mostly published oral songs, with special reference to the heroic deeds of Prince Marko and the Kosovo Battle- related events, just like the singers sang without changes or additions. He collected most of the poems about Lazar near the monasteries on Fru≈°ka Gora, mostly because the seat of the Serbian Orthodox Church was moved there after the Great Migrations of the Serbs. The folk poems about the Kosovo legend can also be found in the collections of Avram Miletiƒá, Ivan Franjo Jukiƒá, Franz Miklosich, Valtazar Bogi≈°iƒá and Grgo Martiƒá. The development of myth structure was also influenced by French chanson de geste. miniature of the Battle of Kosovo, the Illustrated Chronicle of Ivan the Terrible (1567)  The Kosovo Cycle The Kosovo Cycle consists of the following epic poems: * Banoviƒá Strahinja (–ë–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∏—õ –°—Ç—Ä–∞—Ö–∏—ö–∞, Banoviƒá Strahinja) * The Prince's Curse (–ö–ª–µ—Ç–≤–∞ –∫–Ω–µ–∂–µ–≤–∞, Kletva kne≈æeva) * Tsar Lazar and Tsaritsa Milica (–¶–∞—Ä –õ–∞–∑–∞—Ä –∏ —Ü–∞—Ä–∏—Ü–∞ –ú–∏–ª–∏—Ü–∞, Car Lazar i carica Milica) * The Prince's Supper (–ö–Ω–µ–∂–µ–≤–∞ –≤–µ—á–µ—Ä–∞, Kne≈æeva veƒçera) * Kosanƒçiƒá Ivan Spying the Turks (–ö–æ—Å–∞–Ω—á–∏—õ –ò–≤–∞–Ω —É—Ö–æ–¥–∏ –¢—É—Ä–∫–µ, Kosanƒçiƒá Ivan uhodi Turke) * The Fall of the Serbian Empire (–ü—Ä–æ–ø–∞—Å—Ç —Ü–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–∞ —Å—Ä–ø—Å–∫–æ–≥–∞, Propast carstva srpskoga) * The Three Good Heroes (–¢—Ä–∏ –¥–æ–±—Ä–∞ —ò—É–Ω–∞–∫–∞, Tri dobra junaka) * Musiƒá Stefan (–ú—É—Å–∏—õ –°—Ç–µ–≤–∞–Ω, Musiƒá Stevan) * Tsaritsa Milica and Duke Vladeta (–¶–∞—Ä–∏—Ü–∞ –ú–∏–ª–∏—Ü–∞ –∏ –í–ª–∞–¥–µ—Ç–∞ –≤–æ—ò–≤–æ–¥–∞, Carica Milica i Vladeta vojvoda) * Servant Milutin (–°–ª—É–≥–∞ –ú–∏–ª—É—Ç–∏–Ω, Sluga Milutin) * The Death of Milo≈° Dragiloviƒá (Obiliƒá) (–°–º—Ä—Ç –ú–∏–ª–æ—à–∞ –î—Ä–∞–≥–∏–ª–æ–≤–∏—õ–∞ (–û–±–∏–ª–∏—õ–∞), Smrt Milo≈°a Dragiloviƒáa (Obiliƒáa)) * Kosovo Maiden (–ö–æ—Å–æ–≤–∫–∞ –¥–µ–≤–æ—ò–∫–∞, Kosovka devojka) * The Death of Jugoviƒás' Mother (–°–º—Ä—Ç –º–∞—ò–∫–µ –à—É–≥–æ–≤–∏—õ–∞, Smrt majke Jugoviƒáa) * Prince Marko and the Eagle (–ú–∞—Ä–∫–æ –ö—Ä–∞—ô–µ–≤–∏—õ –∏ –æ—Ä–∞–æ, Marko Kraljeviƒá i orao)  Interpretation  The scale of interpretations of the Kosovo Myth is undeniably one of the richest. It can be interpreted as \\"democratic, anti- feudal, with a love for justice and social equality\\". The myth never referred in those early versions to the \\"destiny of Serbs as a nation\\", but to the collapse of Serbian feudal society and its rulers. The myth can be interpreted in different ways in connection with other myths like: myth of military valor, myth of victimhood, myth of salvation and myth of chosen people. It is a myth of Golden Age and Fall. Since its late 19th century ideological construction, the Kosovo myth describes Kosovo as the metaphorical cradle of the Serb nation, and the Serbs as a chosen people. The Kosovo myth is incorporated into the Serb national identity's multifaceted mythomoteur. Military defeat in the Kosovo Battle was portrayed as a moral victory. The centrality of the Kosovo Myth was one of the main causes for merging ethnic and Orthodox Christian religious identity of Serbs.: \\"Unlike, for instance, Serbian nationalism, where ethnic and religious identities have merged (especially through the centrality of the Kosovo myth),...\\" The division of earthly and heavenly power and the choice of the latter by Lazar was meant by the church as a tool of legitimization of Ottoman power among Orthodox Slavs, while at the same time the myth enforced the primacy of the Serbian Orthodox Church over religious affairs. Albanian nationalism in Kosovo has its own narratives, that counter with the Serb Kosovo myth.  Historical basis  Bo≈°ko Jugoviƒá (19th century) by ƒêorƒëe Putnik, one of the mythological Jugoviƒá brothers and flag-bearer during the battle The lack of eyewitnesses accounts of the battle and the early development of the legend made it difficult to comprehend the facts related to the Battle of Kosovo. What is reliably known are the journey of the Turks from Plovdiv to Gazimestan, the time and place of the event, as well as the deaths of both rulers. The unit of Tvrtko I, King of Bosnia, and Albanian forces also took part in the battle in Lazar's army. The Serbian Empire began to break-up soon after the death Stefan Du≈°an (1355) and it had already collapsed long before the Kosovo Battle. The outcome of the battle is not clear from the source either. There are different conclusions, but the most common are those about the Ottoman victory. Tim Judah cites the possibility of a Serbian victory, while Noel Malcolm claims that the outcome was a draw. Although Serbia's strategic fall was the Battle of Maritsa in 1371, Kosovo was the spiritual fall of Serbia and a beginning of a new era for the Serbs. The real Kosovo Battle was not as decisive as presented by the myth because the final downfall of medieval Serbian state. happened 70 years after it, in 1459, when the Ottomans captured Smederevo. Historians cannot reliably establish the identity of Murad's assassin, as well as the existence of betrayal by Vuk Brankoviƒá or anyone else. There are various theories about the death of the sultan. Noel Malcolm explained that the story of the betrayal arose of confusion with the narratives related to the Second Battle of Kosovo (1448), when ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá, Despot of Serbia and the son of Vuk Brankoviƒá, refused to join John Hunyadi, Regent of Hungary, in the fight against the Ottomans. The Jugoviƒái family and the Kosovo Maiden are fictionalized characters. Brendan Humphreys noted that the part of the story of Lazar's choice is a metaphysical narrative added to a historical event by the most religious literalist.  In art and culture  In the first half of the 19th century, plays bout the characters of the Kosovo Myth have been published by Serbian authors educated in the Austrian Empire, who adopted ideas combining Enlightenment rationalism and Romantic nationalism. Some of the dramas were works by Zaharije Orfelin, the Milo≈° Obiliƒá (1828) by Jovan Sterija Popoviƒá, Tsar Lazar or the Fall of the Serbian Empire (1835) by Isidor Nikoliƒá and the Milo≈° Obiliƒá (1858) by Jovan Subotiƒá. Matija Ban, a Serbian poet, dramatist, and playwright from Dubrovnik, included the motives of the Kosovo myth in the drama Tsar Lazar or the Defeat at Kosovo (1858), gradually giving them the values of –†omantic nationalism. Kosovo Maiden (1919) by Uro≈° Prediƒá, is one of the main artistic representation of the Kosovo Myth The poet Petar II Petroviƒá-Njego≈°, Prince-Bishop of Montenegro (1830‚Äì1851), and his epic drama The Mountain Wreath (1847), which is considered as masterpiece and one of the most celebrated works in the South Slavic literature, represents a prominent example that glorifies the heroic ideals and spirit of the Kosovo Myth. It covers a fictional struggle to extermination against converted Muslim Slavs and Ottoman domination. Petroviƒá-Njego≈° often referred to the characters of the Kosovo Myth, cursing Vuk Brankoviƒá and celebrating Milo≈° Obiliƒá, and also used birds as symbols. At the 500th anniversary of the Battle of Kosovo (1889), Franjo Raƒçki and Tomislav Maretiƒá, the key people of the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts in Zagreb, gave lectures on the Battle of Kosovo and epic songs dedicated to it. During the 19th century, the Serbian government financed painters such as ƒêorƒëe Krstiƒá and Nikola Aleksiƒá to decorate churches and monasteries with paintings and frescoes with motifs of Kosovo martyrs. Many significant Serbian painters, Adam Stefanoviƒá, Pavle ƒåortanoviƒá, Paja Jovanoviƒá and Anastas Jovanoviƒá, portrayed the heroes and motifs of epic poems from the Kosovo cycle, while the most prominent painting became the Kosovo Maiden (1919) by Uro≈° Prediƒá. One of the most notable Serbian artists ƒêura Jak≈°iƒá wrote and painted inspired by the Kosovo Myth. Monument to Petar II Petroviƒá-Njego≈° in Andriƒágrad (Vi≈°egrad) founded by Emir Kusturica, with the Ivo Andriƒá's quote ‚ÄúTragic hero of Kosovo thought‚Äù In the early 20th century, several concerts and plays in the National Theatre in Belgrade were dedicated to the Battle of Kosovo and heroes. The play ‚ÄúDeath of the Mother of the Jugoviƒá‚Äù by Ivo Vojnoviƒá, a poet and playwright from Dubrovnik, was first performed in Belgrade in 1906 and in Zagreb in 1907. The first Serbian film, The Life and Deeds of the Immortal Leader Karaƒëorƒëe (1911) directed by Ilija Stanojeviƒá, which portrays Karaƒëorƒëe's leadership of the First Serbian Uprising of 1804‚Äì1813, also features a famous guslar Filip Vi≈°njiƒá who sings about the events of the Kosovo Myth. Croatian sculptor Ivan Me≈°troviƒá contributed to the Myth when in 1907‚Äì11, he was commissioned to design the Vidovdan Temple as \\"the eternal ideal of heroism, loyalty and sacrifice, from which our race draws its faith and moral strength\\" and \\"collective ideal of the Serbian people\\". The temple's actual construction on the Field of Kosovo was postponed because of the Balkan Wars, World War I, World War II, and eventually shelved. Many of Me≈°troviƒá's works dedicated to the Kosovo legends and heroes attracted much attention and were exhibited in many European cities, including in the Grafton Galleries in London and at the Venice Biennale. Croatian painter Mirko Raƒçki, also adopted the mythos and painted numerous paintings within Kosovo cycle, including The Mother of the Jugoviƒá, Nine Jugoviƒá brothers, Kosovo Maiden and Milo≈° Obiliƒá. French translation of Serbian epic songs of the Kosovo cycle Chants de guerre de la Serbie, √©tude, traductions, commentaires (1916) by was awarded an Prix Langlois by the Acad√©mie Fran√ßaise. Shortly after the withdrawal of the Serbian Army through Kosovo and Albania during World War I, the poets began writing on Kosovo topics again. In 1917, Milutin Bojiƒá published the Poems of pain and pride, a lyrical depiction of the torture of people during the war, and deeply affected by the events he wrote: ‚ÄúWe bravely sow our new graves... O, Lord, haven‚Äôt we had enough punishment... It is time to lift the gravestones‚Äù. The same year, poet Milosav Jeliƒá wrote the Serbian sequence and Rastko Petroviƒá published the ‚ÄúKosovo Sonnet‚Äù. Serbian scholar and Hellenist Milo≈° N. ƒêuriƒá explored some elements of the Kosovo Myth from the standpoint of ethics. Works of Ivo Andriƒá, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1961, are sometimes associated with the Kosovo Myth. He wrote an essay about Petroviƒá Njego≈° called the ‚ÄúTragic hero of Kosovo thought‚Äù. The martyrdom of Radisav, a character from Andriƒá's most famous novel The Bridge on the Drina (1945), has been described by some scholars as the reworking of Kosovo legacy and a founding myth of the Serbian nation. In 1953, the Serbian communist government hired Aleksandar Deroko to design the Gazimestan monument commemorating the Kosovo's heroes and Petar Lubarda to decorate the ceremonial hall of the Republican Executive Council with a large wall painting depicting the Battle of Kosovo. caryatids designed by Ivan Me≈°troviƒá, which were supposed to be in his proposed Vidovdan Temple, National Museum of Serbia in Belgrade On the occasion of the 600th anniversary (1989), the film Battle of Kosovo directed Zdravko ≈†otra, based on the drama written by poet Ljubomir Simoviƒá, was released. In the same year, the poet and writer Matija Beƒákoviƒá cointed the famous phrase ‚ÄúKosovo, the Most Expensive Serbian Word‚Äù (Kosovo, najskuplja srpska reƒç; –ö–æ—Å–æ–≤–æ, –Ω–∞—ò—Å–∫—É–ø—ô–∞ —Å—Ä–ø—Å–∫–∞ —Ä–µ—á), while a popular folk song Vidovdan performed by and composed by was published. In his documentary the Serbian Epics (1992), the Academy Award-winning director Pawe≈Ç Pawlikowski portrayed members of the Army of Republika Srpska chanting traditional epic songs about the Battle of Kosovo during the Bosnian War. The Pulitzer Prize- winning poet Charles Simic was strongly influenced by the narrative and magic realism of the Kosovo Cycle. Although Andriƒágrad, founded in Vi≈°egrad in 2014 by the two-time Palme d'Or-winning filmmaker Emir Kusturica, is named after Ivo Andriƒá, it is believed that its purpose is to maintain the Kosovo Myth and the Serbian national consciousness. The main church of Andriƒágrad is a copy of the Visoki Deƒçani in Kosovo and is dedicated to the Holy Emperor Lazar and the Kosovo martyrs. After 15 years of renovation, the National Museum of Serbia in Belgrade was re-opened on Vidovdan, June 28, 2018. Among others, the museum exhibits caryatids designed by Ivan Me≈°troviƒá, which were supposed to be in his proposed Vidovdan Temple. In 2017, Russian heavy metal band Kipelov led by Valery Kipelov released the song ‚ÄúKosovsko Pole‚Äù (–ö–æ—Å–æ–≤–æ –ü–æ–ª–µ; English: Kosovo Field¬ç) about ‚ÄúSerbia‚Äôs national tragedy‚Äù, dwelling on the historic battle in 1389.  Political use  Since its establishment, the Kosovo Myth and its poetic, literary, religious, and philosophical exposition was intertwined with political and ideological agendas. It has had a large impact on Serbian society, and has served as the most powerful Serbian cultural myth. The Myth served as an important constitutive element of the national identity of modern Serbia and its politics.  19th end early 20th century  The Kosovo Myth became a central myth of Serbian nationalism used in the 19th century. Like other European nationalisms, the Serbian one searched for a ‚Äúglorious past‚Äù and a ‚Äúgolden age‚Äù. Writers on nationalism often conclude the golden age with a national catastrophe. Graƒçanica (Kosovski bo≈æuri) (1913) by Nade≈æda Petroviƒá; the red color of flowers has become a symbol of ‚Äúbloodshed in the Battle of Kosovo‚Äù Karaƒëorƒëe, Grand Vo≈æd of Serbia (1804‚Äì1813) and the leader of the First Serbian Uprising, declared himself the godfather of every 9th child in the family, alluding to the nine Jugoviƒá brothers. Throughout most of the 19th century it didn't carry its later importance, as the Principality of Serbia saw the region of Bosnia as its core, not Kosovo. The Congress of Berlin (1878) was the event which caused the elevation of the Kosovo myth in its modern status. The region of Bosnia was effectively handed out to Austria- Hungary and Serbian expansion towards that area was blocked, which in turn left southwards expansion towards Kosovo as the only available geopolitical alternative for the Serbian state. In the 1860s, the Kosovo myth was used as a theme to freedom and democracy among Serbia Liberals and Radicals, while the ruling Conservatives and the Court used it to compare the opposition with the ‚Äútreacherous Vuk Brankoviƒá‚Äù. The 500th anniversary of the Battle of Kosovo (1889) was massively celebrated, with the main commemoration ceremonies in Kru≈°evac, Lazar's former capital, and Ravanica, Lazar's burial place. One year later, Vidovdan became a state holiday. There was a deep belief among Montenegrin people that they descended from Serb knights who fled after the battle and settled in the unreachable mountains. The Kosovo Myth was present among the people in Montenegro before the time of Petar II Petroviƒá-Njego≈°, in the form of folk legends and especially folk songs. He introduced the traditional Montenegrin cap with the aim of strengthening the presence of the Kosovo Myth in everyday life and emphasizing the direct connection with medieval Serbia. Nicholas I of Montenegro (Prince 1860‚Äì1910 and King 1910‚Äì1918) successfully used the motives of the Kosovo Myth with the aim of strengthening Montenegrin patriotism, dreaming of restoring the Serbian Empire. The messages of the Kosovo Myth were used for the idea of Yugoslav unity. The commemoration of the 500th anniversary was also held in Croatia despite restrictions imposed by the Habsburg authorities. At the beginning of the 20th century, with the Yugoslav idea spreading, the Kosovo Myth also became a trope in common culture of Croats and Slovenes.  World War I and Yugoslavia  The Battle of Kosovo (1953) by Petar Lubarda in the New Palace, the former seat of the Executive Council of SR Serbia and the current seat of the Serbian President On Vidovdan in 1914, Gavrilo Princip, the Bosnian Serb member of Young Bosnia, assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria which initiated the July Crisis and led to the outbreak of World War I. Princip, Nedeljko ƒåabrinoviƒá and other members of the Young Bosnia were inspired by the heroism of Milo≈° Obiliƒá, reenacting the Kosovo Myth. Princip knew the entire Njego≈°'s The Mountain Wreath. In 1916, the Yugoslav Committee declared Vidovdan as a national holiday of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. The Myth was used by main advocates of the Yugoslav ideology as a pan-Yugoslav myth in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. In 1920, Vidovdan became one of the three public holidays called ‚ÄúSt. Vitus‚Äô Day Heroes‚Äù, aimg to the symbolic integration of the member of the ‚Äònation with three names‚Äô, while on 28 June 1921, the Vidovdan Constitution was adopted. The Kosovo Myth was used by Serbian nationalists before WWI as an ideological tool in order to argue for a Serbian-led Yugoslavia instead of Yugoslavia as state of all South Slavs equally. After the great losses during World War I which the Serbian army suffered, these ideas further led to confusion among Serbian nationalists between support for a Serbian-led Yugoslavia and Yugoslavia as a state of all South Slavs. In this context, this was the period in which Serbian nationalists began to advance ideas about Serbian ethnic superiority over other South Slavs.\\" The Kosovo Myth also played a role and ideologically shaped the coup d'√©tat (27 March 1941) provoked by the Yugoslav accession to the Tripartite Pact. Gavrilo V, the Patriarch of the Serbian Orthodox Church, who strongly opposed the signing, used the motives of the Kosovo Myth in his radio speech. Milan Nediƒá and his puppet government of the German-occupied territory of Serbia also evoked the Myth, insisting that what the Yugoslav resistance movements are direct opponents of the values and legacy of Kosovo heroes. The Usta≈°e used Vidovdan as an excuse for the massacre during the Genocide of Serbs in the Independent State of Croatia, stating that the Serbs would start a rebellion on that holiday. Following the SFR Yugoslavia's expulsion from the Cominform on Vidovdan in 1948, a government minister Milovan ƒêilas commented that the expelling resolution ‚Äúcut into the minds and hearts of all us Serbs‚Äù and noted ‚Äúthe coincidence in dates between ancient calamities and living threats and onslaughts‚Äù. Josip Broz Tito, President of Yugoslavia (1804‚Äì1813), made little use of the Kosovo Cult, focusing more on self-serving heroic narrative.  The rise of Serbian nationalism and breakup of Yugoslavia  The Kosovo Myth was used to create a Serbian victimization narrative. This myth and its connection to the Serbian victim-centered position was used to legitimize reincorporation of the whole Kosovo into Serbia. The Kosovo Myth was activated and linked to the metaphors of 'genocide'. Albanians were presented by Serb writers as a treacherous and violent people who were settled in Kosovo to collaborate with Ottoman occupiers and terrorize Christian Serbs. They were at times accused of persecution and genocide of Kosovo Serbs since the Middle Ages. This portrayal included claims of a centuries-long genocide of Serbs continued in the 19th century through the forcible expulsion of up to 150,000 Serbs, and also in Tito's Yugoslavia that 'morally disqualified' Albanians to claim any control of Kosovo at the expense of Serbs. There was little statistical information to support these Serbian claims of genocide, nor was rape as frequent an occurrence there as the Serbian nationalists alleged it to be. According to David Bruce MacDonald, this style of ‚Äúparanoid rhetoric‚Äù demonstartes both the perseverance and versatility of Serbian writers when faced with the reality that Serbs had not been victims of genocide in any conventioal sense. Yugoslav Communist authorities, who downplayed the national histories of the country's communities, worked to suppress the Kosovo myth in Serbia. In the context of the Kosovo myth, Greater Serbian propagandists have produced various slogans regarding Kosovo in contemporary Serbia. The myth was used by the Milo≈°eviƒá government and Serbian Orthodox Church to create a narrative of superior Serbdom in conflict with barbarian forces, in order to justify violent actions that were being planned at the time. This way, the myth was utilized as an ideological instrument which fueled policies that led to the Kosovo War along with other political decisions. However, the causes of the war were complex and could not be reduced to the existence of a national myth, but it was used to legitimize Milo≈°eviƒá's reign. Leading up to the Kosovo War, the contemporary Kosovo Albanian political mythology clashed with the Kosovo Myth. During the Yugoslav wars, the Kosovo myth was prevalent, with new war commanders and politicians being compared to heroes from the battle of Kosovo, some of which were later suspected of war crimes. During the Bosnian War and Bosnian genocide, Ratko Mladiƒá, Commander of the Army of Republika Srpska, often called Bosniaks ‚ÄúTurks‚Äù, calling on his troops for revenge and ‚Äúthe Revolt against the Dahijas‚Äù. The important role of the Kosovo myth in Republika Srpska is most clearly manifested in the fact that Vidovdan was declared in 1992 as an official Slava of the Bosnian Serb army, while for most of Bosnian Serbs, Ratko Mladiƒá was considered the Lazar of modern times who with his soldiers was fighting the Turks. Vidovdan was also a date that symbolized the rise and fall of Milo≈°eviƒá, as he gave a speech in the presence of about –∞ million people in 1989 to mark the 600th anniversary of the Battle of Kosovo, and later was arrested and extradited to the ICTY on 28 June 2001 to stand trial for charges of war crimes. Kosovo remained high on the agenda of Vojislav Ko≈°tunica, who served as the President of FR Yugoslavia (2000‚Äì2003) and Prime Minister of Serbia (2004‚Äì2008). He commented, among other things, that a new fight is being waged for control of Kosovo, this time with the United States, and that ‚Äúthe key question is whether force will prevail over justice in the new Battle of Kosovo‚Äù. After the election victory of the For a European Serbia coalition in 2008, they announced that they would not give up their ‚ÄúKosovo orientation.‚Äù –ûn the anniversary of the Battle of Kosovo in 2009, Boris Tadiƒá, President of Serbia (2004‚Äì2012), said :‚ÄúNobody can take Vidovdan from Serbia and from Serbs‚Äù, but that it should not be celebrated as in 1989, which led to wars and sanctions, while Vuk Jeremiƒá, the new Ministry of Foreign Affairs, characterized Vidovdan as a ‚Äúsymbol of defence of Serbian national identity‚Äù.  Use of myth abroad  WWI poster ‚Äì \\"Kossovo Day\\" 28 June 1916. Solidarity with the Serb allies Kosovo was particularly present in the public opinion of Britain during the First World War where 28 June was proclaimed \\"Kossovo Day\\". Manifestations were held across the country. The Kosovo cycle epic folk poems were several times published in France during the war while some French authors emphasized that Kosovo Myth is important to strengthen \\"the energy for revenge\\". In 1915, the French government ordered schools to hold lessons on Serbia and Serbian history, while posters in support of Serbia were pasted in Paris and London, including calls for prayer during the Kossovo Day. The Kosovo Committee was established in London in 1916, headed by Elsie Inglis, and its members included Robert Seton-Watson, Arthur Evans and Charles Oman. They organized a gathering in the St Paul's Cathedral in London. Historian and the University of Belgrade proffesor Pavle Popoviƒá gave a speech at the celebration at the celebration in Cambridge. Seton Watson‚Äôs essay about Serbia was read in schools across the Britain, while eminent historians have contributed to the pro-Serbian narrative in the country, often recalling the Kosovo Myth. Pro- Serbian events and the Kossovo Day were also held in the United States, and in his speech James M. Beck referred to Lazar and the Battle of Kosovo.

During the Second World War, the Roman Catholic Church protested against Aktion T4, the Nazi involuntary euthanasia programme under which the mentally ill, physically deformed, and incurably sick were to be killed. The protests formed one of the most significant public acts of Catholic resistance to Nazism undertaken within Germany. The euthanasia programme began in 1939, and ultimately resulted in the murder of more than 70,000 people who were senile, mentally handicapped, mentally ill, epileptics, cripples, children with Down's Syndrome, or people with similar afflictions. The murders involved interference in Church welfare institutions, and awareness of the murderous programme became widespread. Church leaders who opposed it - chiefly the Catholic Bishop Clemens August von Galen of M√ºnster and Protestant Bishop Theophil Wurm - were therefore able to rouse widespread public opposition. Catholic protests began in the summer of 1940. The Holy See declared on 2 December 1940 that the policy was contrary to natural and positive Divine law, and that: \\"The direct killing of an innocent person because of mental or physical defects is not allowed.\\" In the summer of 1941, protests were led in Germany by Bishop von Galen, whose intervention, according to Richard J. Evans, led to \\"the strongest, most explicit and most widespread protest movement against any policy since the beginning of the Third Reich.\\" In 1943, Pope Pius XII issued the Mystici corporis Christi encyclical, in which he condemned the practice of killing the disabled. The Encyclical was followed, on 26 September 1943, by an open condemnation from the German Bishops which denounced the killing of innocent and defenceless people, whether mentally or physically handicapped, incurably infirm, fatally wounded, innocent hostages, disarmed prisoners of war, criminal offenders, or belonging to a different race. Euthanasia programme While the Nazi Final Solution murder of the Jews took place primarily on German-occupied Polish territory, the murder of invalids took place on German soil and involved interference in Catholic (and Protestant) welfare institutions. Awareness of the murderous programme therefore became widespread, and the Church leaders who opposed it - chiefly the Catholic Bishop of M√ºnster, Clemens August von Galen, and Dr Theophil Wurm, the Protestant Bishop of W√ºrttemberg - were therefore able to rouse widespread public opposition.Peter Hoffmann; The History of the German Resistance 1933-1945; 3rd Edn (First English Edn); McDonald & Jane's; London; 1977; p.24 The intervention led to, in the words of Evans, \\"the strongest, most explicit and most widespread protest movement against any policy since the beginning of the Third Reich.\\" From 1939, the regime began its program of euthanasia, under which those deemed \\"racially unfit\\" were to be \\"euthanised\\". The senile, the mentally handicapped and mentally ill, epileptics, cripples, children with Down's Syndrome and people with similar afflictions were all to be killed. The program ultimately involved the systematic murder of more than 70,000 people. Among those murdered was a cousin of the young Joseph Ratzinger, future Pope Benedict XVI.The Church and Nazi Germany: Opposition, Acquiescence and Collaboration II; Catholic News Agency; 3 October 2011; retrieved 17 September 2013 By the time the Nazis commenced their programme of killing invalids, the Catholic Church in Germany had been subject to prolonged persecution from the State, and had suffered confiscation of property, arrest of clergy, and closure of lay organisations. The Church hierarchy was therefore wary of challenging the regime, for fear of further consequences for the Church. However, on certain matters of doctrine they remained unwilling to compromise. Catholic protest The Papacy and German bishops had already protested against the Nazi sterilization of the \\"racially unfit\\". Catholic protests against the escalation of this policy into \\"euthanasia\\" began in the summer of 1940. Despite Nazi efforts to transfer hospitals to state control, large numbers of handicapped people were still under the care of the Churches. Caritas was the chief organisation running such care services for the Catholic Church. After Protestant welfare activists took a stand at the Bethel Hospital in August von Galen's diocese, Galen wrote to Germany's senior cleric, Cardinal Adolf Bertram, in July 1940 urging the Church to take the moral position. Bertram urged caution. Archbishop Conrad Groeber of Freiburg wrote to the head of the Reich Chancellery, and offered to pay all costs being incurred by the state for the \\"care of mentally ill people intended for death.\\" Caritas directors sought urgent direction from the bishops, and the Fulda Bishops Conference sent a protest letter to the Reich Chancellery on 11 August, then sent Bishop Heinrich Wienken of Caritas to discuss the matter. Wienken cited the commandment \\"thous shalt not kill\\" to officials and warned them to halt the program or face public protest from the Church. Wienken subsequently wavered, fearing a firm line might jeopardise his efforts to have Catholic priests released from Dachau, but was urged to stand firm by Cardinal Michael von Faulhaber. The government refused to give a written undertaking to halt the program, and the Vatican declared on 2 December that the policy was contrary to natural and positive Divine law. Bishop von Galen had the decree printed in his newspaper on 9 March 1941. Subsequent arrests of priests and seizure of Jesuit properties by the Gestapo in his home city of Munster, convinced Galen that the caution advised by his superior had become pointless. On 6, 13 and 20 July 1941, Galen spoke against the seizure of properties and the expulsions of nuns, monks, and religious and criticised the euthanasia programme. In an attempt to cow Galen, the police raided his sister's convent, and detained her in the cellar. She escaped the confinement and Galen, who had also received news of the imminent removal of further patients, launched his most audacious challenge on the regime in a 3 August sermon. He declared the murders to be illegal and said that he had formally accused those responsible for murders in his diocese in a letter to the public prosecutor. The policy opened the way to the murder of all \\"unproductive people\\", like old horses or cows, including invalid war veterans. He asked \\"Who can trust his doctor anymore?\\" He declared, wrote Evans, that Catholics must \\"avoid those who blasphemed, attacked their religion, or brought about the death of innocent men and women. Otherwise they would become involved in their guilt.\\" Galen said that it was the duty of Christians to resist the taking of human life, even if it meant losing their own lives. Reaction \\"The sensation created by the sermons\\", wrote Evans, \\"was enormous\\". Kershaw characterised Von Galen's 1941 \\"open attack\\" on the government's euthanasia program as a \\"vigorous denunciation of Nazi inhumanity and barbarism.\\"Ian Kershaw; The Nazi Dictatorship: Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation; 4th Edn; Oxford University Press; New York; 2000\\"; pp. 210‚Äì11 According to Gill, \\"Galen used his condemnation of this appalling policy to draw wider conclusions about the nature of the Nazi state. He spoke of a moral danger to Germany from the regime's violations of basic human rights.Theodore S. Hamerow; On the Road to the Wolf's Lair - German Resistance to Hitler; Belknap Press of Harvard University Press; 1997; ; p. 289-90 Galen had the sermons read in parish churches. The British broadcast excerpts over the BBC German service, dropped leaflets over Germany, and distributed the sermons in occupied countries. Following the war, Pope Pius XII proclaimed von Galen a hero and promoted him to Cardinal. There were demonstrations across Catholic Germany. Hitler himself faced angry demonstrators at Nuremberg, the only time he was confronted with such resistance by ordinary Germans. The regime did not halt the murders, but took the program underground. Bishop Antonius Hilfrich of Limburg wrote to the Justice Minister, denouncing the murders. Bishop Albert Stohr of Mainz from the pulpit condemned the taking of life. Some of the priests who distributed the sermons were among those arrested and sent to the concentration camps amid the public reaction to the sermons. Bishop von Preysing's Cathedral Administrator, Fr Bernhard Lichtenberg, met his demise for protesting directly to Dr Conti, the Nazi State Medical Director. On 28 August 1941, he endorsed Galen's sermons in a letter to Conti, pointing to the German constitution which defined euthanasia as an act of murder. He was arrested soon after and later died en route to Dachau. Hitler wanted to have Galen removed, but Goebbels told him this would result in the loss of the loyalty of Westphalia. The regional Nazi leader and Hitler's deputy Martin Bormann called for Galen to be hanged, but Hitler and Goebbels urged a delay in retribution till war's end. In a 1942 Table Talk Hitler reportedly said: \\"The fact that I remain silent in public over Church affairs is not in the least misunderstood by the sly foxes of the Catholic Church, and I am quite sure that a man like Bishop von Galen knows full well that after the war I shall extract retribution to the last farthing.\\"Hitler's Table Talk 1941‚Äì1944, Cameron & Stevens, Enigma Books pp. 90, 555. With the programme now public knowledge, nurses and staff (particularly in Catholics institutions) increasingly sought to obstruct implementation of the policy. Under pressure from growing protests, Hitler halted the main euthanasia program on 24 August 1941, though less systematic murder of the handicapped continued. The techniques learnt from the Nazi euthanasia program were later transferred for use in the Holocaust genocide. 1942 Pastoral Letter In the United States, the National Catholic Welfare Conference reported that the German Catholic bishops jointly expressed their \\"horror\\" at the policy in their 1942 Pastoral Letter:The Nazi War Against the Catholic Church; National Catholic Welfare Conference; Washington D.C.; 1942; p.74-80. Mystici corporis Christi In 1943, Pope Pius XII issued the encyclical Mystici corporis Christi, in which he condemned the practice of killing the disabled. He stated his \\"profound grief\\" at the murder of the deformed, the insane, and those suffering from hereditary disease... as though they were a useless burden to Society,\\" in condemnation of the ongoing Nazi euthanasia program. The Encyclical was followed, on 26 September 1943, by an open condemnation from the German Bishops which, from every German pulpit, denounced the killing of \\"innocent and defenceless mentally handicapped, incurably infirm and fatally wounded, innocent hostages, and disarmed prisoners of war and criminal offenders, people of a foreign race or descent.\\" Paragraph 94 of Mystici corporis Christi reads: See also *Catholic Church and Nazi Germany References Category:Catholic resistance to Nazi Germany Category:Roman Catholics in the German Resistance Category:Catholic Church in Germany Category:Pope Pius XII and World War II Category:History of Catholicism in Germany Category:Pope Pius XII Category:Religion and politics Category:Nazi persecution of the Catholic Church Catholic Church Category:Religion and euthanasia ","title":"Nazi euthanasia and the Catholic Church"},{"id":"40966544","text":"Hogan is the given name of: *Hogan Bassey (1932-1998), Nigeria's first world boxing champion *Hogan Ephraim (born 1988), English footballer * Hogan Gidley, American, Republican, White House Deputy Press Secretary *Hogan Jimoh (born 1955), Nigerian boxer of the 1970s and '80s *Hogan McLaughlin (born 1989), American fashion designer, artist, dancer and musician *Hogan Sheffer (born 1958), American television writer ","title":"Hogan (given name)"},{"id":"40966567","text":"Chirruping wedgebill,Pt Augusta, South Australia Wedgebill or wedge-bill is a common name for several birds and may refer to *Australian endemic birds in the genus Psophodes: ** Chiming wedgebill (Psophodes occidentalis) ** Chirruping wedgebill (Psophodes cristatus) See also * Cachar wedge-billed babbler * Sikkim wedge-billed babbler * Wedge-billed woodcreeper ","title":"Wedgebill"},{"id":"40966587","text":"Andronikos Palaiologos Kantakouzenos (died 4 June 1453) was the last Grand Domestic of the Byzantine Empire.

Andronikos was amongst those who advised Emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos to take for his third wife Anna, the daughter of Emperor David of Trebizond, instead of Mara, the daughter of ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá, despot of Serbia.George Sphrantzes, 32.7, translated in Marios Philippides, The Fall of the Byzantine Empire: A Chronicle by George Sphrantzes, 1401-1477 (Amherst: University of Massachusetts, 1980), p. 63 His name appears on the treaty between Byzantium and Venice concluded in April 1448, in place of Demetrios Palaiologos Kantakouzenos, who was indisposed at the time.Nicol, Byzantine Family, p. 180 He is likely the Grand Domestic Kantakouzenos whom Emperor John VIII Palaiologos sent in the fall of 1436 to persuade the Serbians to send a delegation to the Council of Ferrara-Florence concerning the Union of Churches. The historian Sylvester Syropoulos describes this man as the \\"brother-in-law of the Despot of Serbia\\"; Andronikos Palaiologos Kantakouzenos was the brother of Irene Kantakouzene, wife of ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá. The Serbian church refused to participate in this council, and if the identification is correct, it could explain Andronikos' motivation for opposing marriage between Emperor Constantine and Mara Brankoviƒá.  Family  According to the genealogy of his wife Hugues Busac compiled, he was the brother of George Palaiologos Kantakouzenos, and with George possibly son of Demetrios I Kantakouzenos or his brother Theodore Kantakouzenos.

It is his first American production. Corri English studied with a blind coach to learn the mannerisms of the sight impaired. The production also consulted with crisis hotlines to authenticate the calling process for volunteers and how the centers are managed. The film was shot in Los Angeles over the course of 12 nights. The office location where most of the action takes place was in a practically abandoned building which helped sell the isolation and general creepiness of the story. A nighttime schedule also allowed the production to work without disturbing the few residents still left in the entire building. The entire project went from a story by Jason Cuadrado to a completed rough cut in six months. The film was completed and had its domestic premiere at Paramount Studios three months after.

The dish is characteristically black due to the unique use of charred coconut meat. Etymology The name of the dish refers to the black, gray, or greenish color of the broth which is the result of the use of charred coconut meat. It is related to the tinola and nilaga dishes of other Filipino ethnic groups. It is also known as tiyula S≈´g (\\"Sulu stew\\") or tinolang itim (the Tagalog literal translation of tiyula itum). Description Tiyula itum is prepared by rubbing and marinating chunks of beef in a pounded mixture of spices (pamapa) and powdered burnt coconut meat. It is then fried with garlic, onions, turmeric, ginger, and lengkuas. Once the meat is lightly browned, water is added along with additional ingredients like black pepper, lemongrass, and shallots and allowed to simmer until cooked. Coconut milk is sometimes added to thicken the broth. Other ingredients like tomatoes and siling haba chilis are also sometimes added, but they are not traditional. Tiyula itum is traditionally served with white rice or tamu rice cakes.

He is best known for his discovery of MHC class II and for his seminal studies in the fields of transplant immune tolerance and xenotransplantation.  Education  David Sachs graduated summa cum laude in organic chemistry from Harvard College in 1963, and pursued a master's degree equivalent at the University of Paris on a Fulbright Fellowship in 1964. He then matriculated to Harvard Medical School, where he graduated magna cum laude in 1968.  Research  As a medical student, Sachs developed an interest in transplantation and joined the laboratory of Drs. Paul Russell and Henry Winn at the Massachusetts General Hospital, where he remained as a surgical resident until 1970. From 1970 to 1972 Sachs fulfilled his military service working in Christian Anfinsen's laboratory at the National Institutes of Health. He remained in Bethesda and joined the National Cancer Institute, where his research led to the discovery of class II MHC in 1973. He was then appointed director of the Transplantation Biology Section of the Immunology Branch at NCI in 1974, and Chief of the Immunology Branch in 1982. In 1991 Sachs returned to Boston, where he was appointed Professor of Surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. At MGH Sachs further developed his research in the field of transplantation tolerance. In the 1980s Sachs had shown that mixed-chimerism can lead to transplant tolerance in small animal models; these findings were then confirmed in a large animal model during Sachs' tenure at Harvard. Based on these observations, Sachs and his colleagues at Massachusetts General Hospital developed the first clinical protocol for the induction of organ transplantation tolerance in the early 2000s.

The nearly road, located in Pecos County, provides access to a natural gas field from Interstate 10 (I-10) between Fort Stockton and Bakersfield. The route's numerical designation was previously assigned to a road in Nacogdoches County. Route description RM 2023 begins in the Puckett Gas Field at the north end of Puckett Road, a county road that approaches from the southeast from U.S. Route 285 (US 285). After a short distance, RM 2023 intersects Harrel Road which connects to RM 2886. The road then proceeds northward through ranch land along drainage canyons before ending at I-10 approximately east of Fort Stockton. RM 2023 has a rural minor collector functional class as rated by TxDOT which has approved a speed limit of up to over nearly all of the route. The section of the road between Puckett Rd. and Harrel Rd. had an average annual daily traffic (AADT) count of 70 vehicles in 2010 including 5.5 percent peak hour truck usage. The longer section between Harrel Rd. and I-10 had an AADT count of 100 vehicles with a 6.1 percent peak hour truck usage. TxDOT projects the AADT counts to increase to 120 and 170 respectively for the two segments in 2030. History RM 2023 was originally designated on December 17, 1952 as a Farm to Market Road in Nacogdoches County. FM 2023 began at U.S. Highway 59 (US 59) in Garrison and proceeded to the southeast. On November 28, 1958, that route designation was cancelled when the road was added to FM 138 as an extension. The current route in Pecos County was designated along its present extent on November 24, 1959. The road previously terminated at US 290, the predecessor route to I-10 through much of western Texas.
