Sandia Peak - New Mexico Adults are brown on the head, back, and breast with pink on the belly, rump, and wings. The forehead is black. They have short black legs and a long forked tail. Their breeding habitat is mountain peaks in the central Rocky Mountains of the United States. They build a cup nest in a cavity on a cliff, or re-use abandoned cliff swallow nests. In winter, these birds migrate short distances to lower elevations. These birds forage on the ground, but may fly to catch insects in flight. They mainly eat seeds from weeds and grasses and insects. They often feed in small flocks. At one time, the three North American rosy finches were considered to be one species. The population of this bird appears to be declining.

It is a machine independent method of assigning a probability value to each hypothesis (algorithm/program) that explains a given observation, with the simplest hypothesis (the shortest program) having the highest probability and the increasingly complex hypotheses receiving increasingly small probabilities. Solomonoff founded the theory of universal inductive inference, which is based on solid philosophical foundations and has its root in Kolmogorov complexity and algorithmic information theory. The theory uses algorithmic probability in a Bayesian framework. The universal prior is taken over the class of all computable measures; no hypothesis will have a zero probability. This enables Bayes' rule (of causation) to be used to predict the most likely next event in a series of events, and how likely it will be. Although he is best known for algorithmic probability and his general theory of inductive inference, he made many other important discoveries throughout his life, most of them directed toward his goal in artificial intelligence: to develop a machine that could solve hard problems using probabilistic methods.  Life history through 1964  Ray Solomonoff was born on July 25, 1926, in Cleveland, Ohio, son of Jewish Russian immigrants Phillip Julius and Sarah Mashman Solomonoff. He attended Glenville High School, graduating in 1944. In 1944 he joined the United States Navy as Instructor in Electronics. From 1947‚Äì1951 he attended the University of Chicago, studying under Professors such as Rudolf Carnap and Enrico Fermi, and graduated with an M.S. in Physics in 1951. From his earliest years he was motivated by the pure joy of mathematical discovery and by the desire to explore where no one had gone before. At age of 16, in 1942, he began to search for a general method to solve mathematical problems. In 1952 he met Marvin Minsky, John McCarthy and others interested in machine intelligence. In 1956 Minsky and McCarthy and others organized the Dartmouth Summer Research Conference on Artificial Intelligence, where Solomonoff was one of the original 10 invitees‚Äîhe, McCarthy, and Minsky were the only ones to stay all summer. It was for this group that Artificial Intelligence was first named as a science. Computers at the time could solve very specific mathematical problems, but not much else. Solomonoff wanted to pursue a bigger question, how to make machines more generally intelligent, and how computers could use probability for this purpose.  Work history through 1964  He wrote three papers, two with Anatol Rapoport, in 1950‚Äì52,\\"An Exact Method for the Computation of the Connectivity of Random Nets\\", Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics, Vol 14, p. 153, 1952. that are regarded as the earliest statistical analysis of networks. He was one of the 10 attendees at the 1956 Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence. He wrote and circulated a report among the attendees: \\"An Inductive Inference Machine\\". It viewed machine learning as probabilistic, with an emphasis on the importance of training sequences, and on the use of parts of previous solutions to problems in constructing trial solutions for new problems. He published a version of his findings in 1957.An Inductive Inference Machine,\\" IRE Convention Record, Section on Information Theory, Part 2, pp. 56‚Äì62. (pdf version) These were the first papers to be written on probabilistic Machine Learning. In the late 1950s, he invented probabilistic languages and their associated grammars.\\"A Progress Report on Machines to Learn to Translate Languages and Retrieve Information\\", Advances in Documentation and Library Science, Vol III, pt. 2, pp. 941‚Äì953. (Proceedings of a conference in Sept. 1959.) A probabilistic language assigns a probability value to every possible string. Generalizing the concept of probabilistic grammars led him to his discovery in 1960 of Algorithmic Probability and General Theory of Inductive Inference. Prior to the 1960s, the usual method of calculating probability was based on frequency: taking the ratio of favorable results to the total number of trials. In his 1960 publication, and, more completely, in his 1964 publications, Solomonoff seriously revised this definition of probability. He called this new form of probability \\"Algorithmic Probability\\" and showed how to use it for prediction in his theory of inductive inference. As part of this work, he produced the philosophical foundation for the use of Bayes rule of causation for prediction. The basic theorem of what was later called Kolmogorov Complexity was part of his General Theory. Writing in 1960, he begins: \\"Consider a very long sequence of symbols ...We shall consider such a sequence of symbols to be 'simple' and have a high a priori probability, if there exists a very brief description of this sequence ‚Äì using, of course, some sort of stipulated description method. More exactly, if we use only the symbols 0 and 1 to express our description, we will assign the probability 2‚àíN to a sequence of symbols if its shortest possible binary description contains N digits.\\"\\"A Preliminary Report on a General Theory of Inductive Inference,\\", 1960 p. 1 The probability is with reference to a particular Universal Turing machine. Solomonoff showed and in 1964 proved that the choice of machine, while it could add a constant factor would not change the probability ratios very much. These probabilities are machine independent. In 1965, the Russian mathematician Kolmogorov independently published similar ideas. When he became aware of Solomonoff's work, he acknowledged Solomonoff, and for several years, Solomonoff's work was better known in the Soviet Union than in the Western World. The general consensus in the scientific community, however, was to associate this type of complexity with Kolmogorov, who was more concerned with randomness of a sequence. Algorithmic Probability and Universal (Solomonoff) Induction became associated with Solomonoff, who was focused on prediction‚Äîthe extrapolation of a sequence. Later in the same 1960 publication Solomonoff describes his extension of the single-shortest-code theory. This is Algorithmic Probability. He states: \\"It would seem that if there are several different methods of describing a sequence, each of these methods should be given some weight in determining the probability of that sequence.\\"\\"A Preliminary Report on a General Theory of Inductive Inference,\\",1960, p. 17 He then shows how this idea can be used to generate the universal a priori probability distribution and how it enables the use of Bayes rule in inductive inference. Inductive inference, by adding up the predictions of all models describing a particular sequence, using suitable weights based on the lengths of those models, gets the probability distribution for the extension of that sequence. This method of prediction has since become known as Solomonoff induction. He enlarged his theory, publishing a number of reports leading up to the publications in 1964. The 1964 papers give a more detailed description of Algorithmic Probability, and Solomonoff Induction, presenting five different models, including the model popularly called the Universal Distribution.  Work history from 1964 to 1984  Other scientists who had been at the 1956 Dartmouth Summer Conference (such as Newell and Simon) were developing the branch of Artificial Intelligence which used machines governed by if-then rules, fact based. Solomonoff was developing the branch of Artificial Intelligence that focussed on probability and prediction; his specific view of A.I. described machines that were governed by the Algorithmic Probability distribution. The machine generates theories together with their associated probabilities, to solve problems, and as new problems and theories develop, updates the probability distribution on the theories. In 1968 he found a proof for the efficacy of Algorithmic Probability,\\"Complexity-based Induction Systems, Comparisons and convergence Theorems\\" IEEE Trans. on Information Theory Vol. IT-24, No. 4, pp.422‚Äì432, July,1978. (pdf version) but mainly because of lack of general interest at that time, did not publish it until 10 years later. In his report, he published the proof for the convergence theorem. In the years following his discovery of Algorithmic Probability he focused on how to use this probability and Solomonoff Induction in actual prediction and problem solving for A.I. He also wanted to understand the deeper implications of this probability system. One important aspect of Algorithmic Probability is that it is complete and incomputable. In the 1968 report he shows that Algorithmic Probability is complete; that is, if there is any describable regularity in a body of data, Algorithmic Probability will eventually discover that regularity, requiring a relatively small sample of that data. Algorithmic Probability is the only probability system known to be complete in this way. As a necessary consequence of its completeness it is incomputable. The incomputability is because some algorithms‚Äîa subset of those that are partially recursive‚Äîcan never be evaluated fully because it would take too long. But these programs will at least be recognized as possible solutions. On the other hand, any computable system is incomplete. There will always be descriptions outside that system's search space which will never be acknowledged or considered, even in an infinite amount of time. Computable prediction models hide this fact by ignoring such algorithms. In many of his papers he described how to search for solutions to problems and in the 1970s and early 1980s developed what he felt was the best way to update the machine. The use of probability in A.I., however, did not have a completely smooth path. In the early years of A.I., the relevance of probability was problematic. Many in the A.I. community felt probability was not usable in their work. The area of pattern recognition did use a form of probability, but because there was no broadly based theory of how to incorporate probability in any A.I. field, most fields did not use it at all. There were, however, researchers such as Pearl and Peter Cheeseman who argued that probability could be used in artificial intelligence. About 1984, at an annual meeting of the American Association for Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), it was decided that probability was in no way relevant to A.I. A protest group formed, and the next year there was a workshop at the AAAI meeting devoted to \\"Probability and Uncertainty in AI.\\" This yearly workshop has continued to the present day.\\"The Universal Distribution and Machine Learning\\", The Kolmogorov Lecture, Feb. 27, 2003, Royal Holloway, Univ. of London. The Computer Journal, Vol 46, No. 6, 2003. As part of the protest at the first workshop, Solomonoff gave a paper on how to apply the universal distribution to problems in A.I.\\"The Application of Algorithmic Probability to Problems in Artificial Intelligence\\", in Kanal and Lemmer (Eds.), Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence,, Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., pp 473‚Äì491, 1986. This was an early version of the system he has been developing since that time. In that report, he described the search technique he had developed. In search problems, the best order of search, is time T_i/P_i, where T_i is the time needed to test the trial and P_i is the probability of success of that trial. He called this the \\"Conceptual Jump Size\\" of the problem. Levin's search technique approximates this order,Levin, L.A., \\"Universal Search Problems\\", in Problemy Peredaci Informacii 9, pp. 115‚Äì116, 1973 and so Solomonoff, who had studied Levin's work, called this search technique Lsearch.  Work history ‚Äî the later years  In other papers he explored how to limit the time needed to search for solutions, writing on resource bounded search. The search space is limited by available time or computation cost rather than by cutting out search space as is done in some other prediction methods, such as Minimum Description Length. Throughout his career Solomonoff was concerned with the potential benefits and dangers of A.I., discussing it in many of his published reports. In 1985 he analyzed a likely evolution of A.I., giving a formula predicting when it would reach the \\"Infinity Point\\".\\"The Time Scale of Artificial Intelligence: Reflections on Social Effects,\\" Human Systems Management, Vol 5, pp. 149‚Äì153, 1985 (pdf version) This work is part of the history of thought about a possible technological singularity. Originally algorithmic induction methods extrapolated ordered sequences of strings. Methods were needed for dealing with other kinds of data. A 1999 report,\\"Two Kinds of Probabilistic Induction,\\" The Computer Journal, Vol 42, No. 4, 1999. (pdf version) generalizes the Universal Distribution and associated convergence theorems to unordered sets of strings and a 2008 report,\\"Three Kinds of Probabilistic Induction, Universal Distributions and Convergence Theorems\\" 2008. (pdf version) to unordered pairs of strings. In 1997,\\"The Discovery of Algorithmi Probability,\\" Journal of Computer and System Sciences, Vol 55, No. 1, pp. 73‚Äì88 (pdf version) 2003 and 2006 he showed that incomputability and subjectivity are both necessary and desirable characteristics of any high performance induction system. In 1970 he formed his own one man company, Oxbridge Research, and continued his research there except for periods at other institutions such as MIT, University of Saarland in Germany and the Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Lugano, Switzerland. In 2003 he was the first recipient of the Kolmogorov Award by The Computer Learning Research Center at the Royal Holloway, University of London, where he gave the inaugural Kolmogorov Lecture. Solomonoff was most recently a visiting Professor at the CLRC. In 2006 he spoke at AI@50, \\"Dartmouth Artificial Intelligence Conference: the Next Fifty Years\\" commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the original Dartmouth summer study group. Solomonoff was one of five original participants to attend. In Feb. 2008, he gave the keynote address at the Conference \\"Current Trends in the Theory and Application of Computer Science\\" (CTTACS), held at Notre Dame University in Lebanon. He followed this with a short series of lectures, and began research on new applications of Algorithmic Probability. Algorithmic Probability and Solomonoff Induction have many advantages for Artificial Intelligence. Algorithmic Probability gives extremely accurate probability estimates. These estimates can be revised by a reliable method so that they continue to be acceptable. It utilizes search time in a very efficient way. In addition to probability estimates, Algorithmic Probability \\"has for AI another important value: its multiplicity of models gives us many different ways to understand our data; A description of Solomonoff's life and work prior to 1997 is in \\"The Discovery of Algorithmic Probability\\", Journal of Computer and System Sciences, Vol 55, No. 1, pp 73‚Äì88, August 1997. The paper, as well as most of the others mentioned here, are available on his website at the publications page. In an article published the year of his death, a journal article said of Solomonoff: \\"A very conventional scientist understands his science using a single 'current paradigm'‚Äîthe way of understanding that is most in vogue at the present time. A more creative scientist understands his science in very many ways, and can more easily create new theories, new ways of understanding, when the 'current paradigm' no longer fits the current data\\".\\"Algorithmic Probability, Theory and Applications,\\" In Information Theory and Statistical Learning, Eds Frank Emmert-Streib and Matthias Dehmer, Springer Science and Business Media, 2009, p. 11 See also * Ming Li and Paul Vitanyi, An Introduction to Kolmogorov Complexity and Its Applications.

Subtropical climates are often characterized by hot summers and mild winters with infrequent frost. Most subtropical climates fall into two basic types: humid subtropical, where rainfall is often concentrated in the warmest months, for example southeast China and the southeast United States, and dry summer or Mediterranean climate, where seasonal rainfall is concentrated in the cooler months, such as the Mediterranean Basin or southern California. Subtropical climates can occur at high elevations within the tropics, such as in the southern end of the Mexican Plateau and in the Vietnamese Highlands. Six climate classifications use the term to help define the various temperature and precipitation regimes for planet Earth. A great portion of the world's deserts are located within the subtropics, due to the development of the subtropical ridge. Areas bordering warm oceans (typically on the southeast sides of continents) are prone to locally heavy rainfall from tropical cyclones, which can contribute a significant percentage of the annual rainfall. Areas bordering cool oceans (typically on the southwest sides of continents) are prone to fog, aridity, and dry summers. Plants such as palms, citrus, mango, pistachio, lychee, and avocado are grown in the subtropics. Definition The tropics have been historically defined as lying between the Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn, located at latitudes 23.45¬∞ north and south, respectively. According to the American Meteorological Society, the poleward fringe of the subtropics is located at latitudes approximately 35¬∞ north and south, respectively.  Temperatures  Tadrart Acacus desert, part of the Sahara, in western Libya. Several methods have been used to define the subtropical climate. The most well known is the Trewartha climate classification, a subtropical region should have at least eight months with a mean temperature greater than and at least one month with a mean temperature under .Belda et al. Climate classification revisited: from K√∂ppen to Trewartha. In: Climate Research Vol. 59: 1‚Äì13, 2014. In most regions in this climate zone the coldest month has a mean temperature of above . In the Trewartha climate classification, most of these climates are located in the most equatorial portions of the temperate zone (latitudes between 23.5 and 35 north and south). German climatologists Carl Troll and Karlheinz Paffen defined warm temperate zones as plain and hilly lands having an average temperature of the coldest month between and in the Northern Hemisphere and between and in the Southern Hemisphere, excluding oceanic and continental climates. According to the Troll-Paffen climate classification, there generally exists one large subtropical zone named the warm-temperate subtropical zone,Climatic map by Istituto Geografico De Agostini, according to Troll-Paffen climate classification which is subdivided into seven smaller areas.Die Klimaklassifikation nach Troll / Paffen ‚Äì klimadiagramme.de According to the E. Neef climate classification, the subtropical zone is divided into two parts: rainy winters of the west sides and eastern subtropical climate.Die Klimaklassifikation nach E. Neef ‚Äì klimadiagramme.de According to the Wilhelm Lauer & Peter Frankenberg climate classification, the subtropical zone is divided into three parts: high-continental, continental, and maritime.Wilhelm Lauer & Peter Frankenberg climate classification According to the Siegmund/Frankenberg climate classification, subtropical is one of six climate zones in the world.Die Klimatypen der Erde ‚Äì P√§dagogische Hochschule in Heidelberg Leslie Holdridge defined the subtropical climates as having a mean annual biotemperature between the frost line or critical temperature line, 16¬∞C to 18¬∞C (depending on locations in the world) and 24¬∞C.LIFE ZONE ECOLOGY by L. R. Holdridge. The frost line separates the warm temperate region from the subtropical region. It represents the dividing line between two major physiological groups of evolved plants. On the warmer side of the line, the majority of the plants are sensitive to low temperatures. They can be killed back by frosts as they have not evolved to withstand periods of cold. On the colder temperate side of the line, the total flora is adapted to survive periods of variable length of low temperatures, whether as seeds in the case of the annuals or as perennial plants which can withstand the cold.

The Holdridge subtropical climates straddle more or less the warmest subtropical climates and the less warm tropical climates as defined by the K√∂ppen-Geiger or Trewartha climate classifications. However Wladimir K√∂ppen has distinguished the hot or subtropical and tropical (semi-)arid climates (BWh or BSh) having an average annual temperature greater than or equal to from the cold or temperate (semi-)arid climates (BWk or BSk) whose annual temperature average is lower. This definition, though restricted to dry regions, is almost similar to Holdridge's.  Rainfall  Hadley cells located on the Earth's atmospheric circulation. Heating of the earth near the equator leads to large amounts of upward motion and convection along the monsoon trough or intertropical convergence zone. The upper-level divergence over the near-equatorial trough leads to air rising and moving away from the equator aloft. As the air moves towards the mid-latitudes, it cools and sinks, which leads to subsidence near the 30th parallel of both hemispheres. This circulation is known as the Hadley cell and leads to the formation of the subtropical ridge.Dr. Owen E. Thompson (1996). Hadley Circulation Cell. Channel Video Productions.

This regime is known as an arid subtropical climate, which is generally located in areas adjacent to powerful cold ocean currents. Examples of this climate are the coastal areas of Southern Africa and the west coast of South America. The humid subtropical climate is often located on the western side of the subtropical high. Here, unstable tropical airmasses in summer bring convective overturning and frequent tropical downpours, and summer is normally the season of peak annual rainfall. In the winter (dry season) the monsoon retreats, and the drier trade winds bring more stable airmass and often dry weather, and frequent sunny skies. Areas that have this type of subtropical climate include Australia, Southeast Asia, and parts of South America.Randy Lascody (2008). The Florida Rain Machine. National Weather Service. Retrieved on 6 February 2009. In areas bounded by warm ocean like the southeastern North America and East Asia, tropical cyclones can contribute significantly to local rainfall within the subtropics. Japan receives over half of its rainfall from typhoons. The Mediterranean climate is a subtropical climate with a wet season in winter and a dry season in the summer.

As one moves toward the tropical side the slight winter cool season disappears, while at the poleward threshold of the subtropics the winters become cooler. Some crops which have been traditionally farmed in tropical climates, such as mango, litchi, and avocado, are cultivated in the subtropics. Pest control of the crops is easier than in the tropics, due to the cooler winters. Tree ferns (pteridophytes) are grown in subtropical areas, as are dracaena and yucca, and trees in the Taxaceae. Apple, pear and pomegranate also grow well in the subtropics. Varieties =Humid subtropical climate= Wetland Park in Hong Kong. The humid subtropical climate is a subtropical climate type characterized by hot, humid summers with frequent tropical downpours of short duration and warm, and frequently dry winters. In summer, the subtropical high pressure cells provide a sultry flow of tropical air with high dew points, and daily thundershowers are typical, though brief. Normally, rainfall is concentrated in the warmest months of the year. At times, the average annual precipitation may be more evenly distributed throughout the year, or a spring maximum is present. With decreasing latitude most humid subtropical climates typically have drier winters and wetter summers. Humid subtropical climates lie on the lower east side of continents, roughly between latitudes 25¬∞ and 35¬∞ degrees away from the equator. In the United States, the humid subtropical zone is normally considered the region from central Florida north to Virginia Beach, Virginia. =Oceanic climate= Although rare, and only agreed by a few climatologists (namely Trewartha), oceanic climates can also be classified as subtropical. Other classifications such as the K√∂ppen climate classification do not include it as subtropical. By this definition, places like the northwestern Iberian Peninsula, southwestern France (reaching as far as La Rochelle), New Zealand's North Island, the highlands of The Azores and Hawaii islands, southeastern Australia, southeastern South Africa or Tristan da Cunha are defined as subtropical. =Mediterranean climate= Parc G√ºell, Barcelona, Spain. The Mediterranean climate regime resembles the climate of the lands in the Mediterranean Basin, parts of coastal southwestern North America (including western parts of the Pacific northwest), parts of Western and South Australia, in southwestern South Africa and in parts of central Chile. The climate is characterized by hot dry summers and cooler winters with rainfall. In Europe, the northernmost mediterranean climates are found along the Italian Riviera, located at 44¬∞ latitude. Parts of southwestern Australia around Perth have a Mediterranean climate as do areas around coastal South Africa. Not all places with a Mediterranean climate can be classified as subtropical, as it's the case with the Northwestern United States or anywhere with a Cold-summer Mediterranean climate. =Semi-desert/desert climate= Mount Benacantil, Alicante, Spain. According to K√∂ppen, Arid subtropical climates are characterized by an annual average temperature above , the absence of regular rainfall, and high humidity.

Note the can is narrowed at the top to allow for a smaller ‚Äúend‚Äù An aluminum can (British English: aluminium can), sometimes erroneously referred to as a \\"tin can\\", is a single- use container for packaging made primarily of aluminum. It is commonly used for foods and drinks such as beer, baked beans and soup but also for products such as oil, chemicals, and other liquids. Global production is 180 billion annually and constitutes the largest single use of aluminum globally. Usage This video describes the engineering choices underlying the design of a beverage can Use of aluminum in cans began in 1957.Petroleum week, Volume 9, 1959, p. 82 (Google Books) Aluminum offers greater malleability, resulting in ease of manufacture; this gave rise to the two-piece can, where all but the top of the can is simply stamped out of a single piece of aluminum, rather than constructed from two pieces of steel. The inside of the can is lined by spray coating an epoxy lacquer or polymer to protect the aluminum from being corroded by acidic contents such as carbonated beverages and imparting a metallic taste to the beverage. The epoxy may contain bisphenol A. A label is either printed directly on the side of the can or will be glued to the outside of the curved surface, indicating its contents. Most aluminum cans are made of two pieces. The bottom and body are \\"drawn\\" or \\"drawn and ironed\\" from a flat plate or shallow cup. After filling, the can \\"end\\" is sealed onto the top of the can. This is supplemented by a sealing compound to ensure that the top is air tight. The advantages of aluminum over steel (tinplate) cans include; * light weight * competitive cost * usage of easy-open aluminum ends: no need for a can opener * clean appearance * aluminum does not rust The easy-open aluminum end for beverage cans was developed by Alcoa in 1962 for the Pittsburgh Brewing Company and is now used in nearly all of the canned beer market. Recycling Discarded aluminum beverage cans marked with five-cent refund labeling per the Oregon Bottle Bill, early 1970s Aluminum cans can be made with recycled aluminum. In 2017, 3.8 million tons of aluminum, were generated in the US of which 0.62 million tons were recycled - a recycling rate of 16%. According to estimates from the Aluminum Association, a large amount of aluminium remains unrecycled in the US, where roughly $700 million worth of cans end up in landfills. In 2012, 92% of the aluminum beverage cans sold in Switzerland were recycled. Cans are the most recycled beverage container, at a rate of 69% worldwide. According to Alcoa Aluminum Company, in 2015 about 34 cans are required to achieve a weight of one pound. The unstated assumption is that most of those will be the typical 12-ounce can. Wise Recycling in Pensacola, FL also reported that the price they paid for aluminum cans varied, based on the published price of aluminum in the commodities market. They denied that there was a seasonal price fluctuation, and stated that the nationally published commodity price was the sole determining factor in what they paid. Some recycle centers pay a slightly higher price (normally 2 cents) for 100 pounds or more of cans, while others pay the same price regardless of the weight being submitted. One issue is that the top of the can is made from a blend of aluminum and magnesium to increase its strength. When the can is melted for recycling, the mixture is unsuitable for either the top or the bottom/side. Instead of mixing recycled metal with more aluminum (to soften it) or magnesium (to harden it), a new approach uses annealing to produce an alloy that works for both. The aluminum can is also considered the most valuable recyclable material in an average recycling bin. It is estimated that Americans throw away nearly 1 billion dollars a year in wasted aluminum. The aluminum industry pays nearly 800 million dollars a year for recycled aluminum since it is so versatile. Because of the advantages of aluminium packaging (shelf life, durability, food grade factor) over plastics, it is considered an alternative to PET bottles, with the possibility of replacing the majority of them in the next decades.

It was invented by Ray Solomonoff in the 1960s.Solomonoff, R., \\"A Preliminary Report on a General Theory of Inductive Inference\\", Report V-131, Zator Co., Cambridge, Ma. (Nov. 1960 revision of the Feb. 4, 1960 report). It is used in inductive inference theory and analyses of algorithms. In his general theory of inductive inference, Solomonoff uses the prior obtained by this formula, in Bayes' rule for prediction .Li, M. and Vitanyi, P., An Introduction to Kolmogorov Complexity and Its Applications, 3rd Edition, Springer Science and Business Media, N.Y., 2008 In the mathematical formalism used, the observations have the form of finite binary strings, and the universal prior is a probability distribution over the set of finite binary strings . The prior is universal in the Turing-computability sense, i.e. no string has zero probability. It is not computable, but it can be approximated.Hutter, M., Legg, S., and Vitanyi, P., \\"Algorithmic Probability\\", Scholarpedia, 2(8):2572, 2007. Overview Algorithmic probability deals with the following questions: Given a body of data about some phenomenon that we want to understand, how can we select the most probable hypothesis of how it was caused from among all possible hypotheses and how can we evaluate the different hypotheses? How can we predict future data and how can we measure the likelihood of that prediction being the right one? Four principal inspirations for Solomonoff's algorithmic probability were: Occam's razor, Epicurus' principle of multiple explanations, modern computing theory (e.g. use of a universal Turing machine) and Bayes‚Äô rule for prediction.Li and Vitanyi, 2008, p. 347 Occam's razor and Epicurus' principle are essentially two different non-mathematical approximations of the universal prior. * Occam's razor: among the theories that are consistent with the observed phenomena, one should select the simplest theory.Li and Vitanyi, 2008, p. 341 * Epicurus' principle of multiple explanations: if more than one theory is consistent with the observations, keep all such theories.Li and Vitanyi, 2008, p. 339. At the heart of the universal prior is an abstract model of a computer, such as a universal Turing machine.Hutter, M., \\"Algorithmic Information Theory\\", Scholarpedia, 2(3):2519. Any abstract computer will do, as long as it is Turing-complete, i.e. every finite binary string has at least one program that will compute it on the abstract computer. The abstract computer is used to give precise meaning to the phrase \\"simple explanation\\" . In the formalism used, explanations, or theories of phenomena, are computer programs that generate observation strings when run on the abstract computer. A simple explanation is a short computer program. A complex explanation is a long computer program. Simple explanations are more likely, so a high-probability observation string is one generated by a short computer program, or perhaps by any of a large number of slightly longer computer programs. A low-probability observation string is one that can only be generated by a long computer program . These ideas can be made specific and the probabilities used to construct a prior probability distribution for the given observation. Solomonoff's main reason for inventing this prior is so that it can be used in Bayes' rule when the actual prior is unknown, enabling prediction under uncertainty. It predicts the most likely continuation of that observation, and provides a measure of how likely this continuation will be. Although the universal probability of an observation (and its extension) is incomputable, there is a computer algorithm, Levin Search, Levin, L.A., \\"Universal Search Problems\\", in Problemy Peredaci Informacii 9, pp. 115‚Äì116, 1973 which, when run for longer and longer periods of time, will generate a sequence of approximations which converge to the universal probability distribution. Solomonoff proved this distribution to be machine-invariant within a constant factor (called the invariance theorem).Solomonoff, R., \\"Complexity-Based Induction Systems: Comparisons and Convergence Theorems,\\" IEEE Trans. on Information Theory, Vol. IT-24, No. 4, pp. 422-432, July 1978 Solomonoff invented the concept of algorithmic probability with its associated invariance theorem around 1960,Solomonoff, R., \\"The Discovery of Algorithmic Probability\\", Journal of Computer and System Sciences, Vol. 55, No. 1, pp. 73-88, August 1997. publishing a report on it: \\"A Preliminary Report on a General Theory of Inductive Inference.\\"Solomonoff, R., \\"A Preliminary Report on a General Theory of Inductive Inference\\", Report V-131, Zator Co., Cambridge, Ma. (Nov. 1960 revision of the Feb. 4, 1960 report). He clarified these ideas more fully in 1964 with \\"A Formal Theory of Inductive Inference,\\" Part ISolomonoff, R., \\"A Formal Theory of Inductive Inference, Part I\\". Information and Control, Vol 7, No. 1 pp 1-22, March 1964. and Part II.Solomonoff, R., \\"A Formal Theory of Inductive Inference, Part II\\" Information and Control, Vol 7, No. 2 pp 224‚Äì254, June 1964.  Further discussion  Solomonoff described a universal computer with a randomly generated input program. The program computes some possibly infinite output. The universal probability distribution is the probability distribution on all possible output strings with random input.Solomonoff, R., \\"The Kolmogorov Lecture: The Universal Distribution and Machine Learning\\" The Computer Journal, Vol 46, No. 6 p 598, 2003. The algorithmic probability of any given finite output prefix q is the sum of the probabilities of the programs that compute something starting with q. Certain long objects with short programs have high probability. Algorithmic probability is the main ingredient of Solomonoff's theory of inductive inference, the theory of prediction based on observations; it was invented with the goal of using it for machine learning; given a sequence of symbols, which one will come next? Solomonoff's theory provides an answer that is optimal in a certain sense, although it is incomputable. Unlike, for example, Karl Popper's informal inductive inference theory, Solomonoff's is mathematically rigorous. Algorithmic probability is closely related to the concept of Kolmogorov complexity. Kolmogorov's introduction of complexity was motivated by information theory and problems in randomness, while Solomonoff introduced algorithmic complexity for a different reason: inductive reasoning. A single universal prior probability that can be substituted for each actual prior probability in Bayes‚Äôs rule was invented by Solomonoff with Kolmogorov complexity as a side product.G√°cs, P. and Vit√°nyi, P., \\"In Memoriam Raymond J. Solomonoff\\", IEEE Information Theory Society Newsletter, Vol. 61, No. 1, March 2011, p 11. Solomonoff's enumerable measure is universal in a certain powerful sense, but the computation time can be infinite. One way of dealing with this issue is a variant of Leonid Levin's Search Algorithm,Levin, L.A., \\"Universal Search Problems\\", in Problemy Peredaci Informacii 9, pp. 115‚Äì116, 1973 which limits the time spent computing the success of possible programs, with shorter programs given more time. Other methods of limiting the search space include training sequences.

Early life and education  Gmelin was born in T√ºbingen, the son of a professor at the University of T√ºbingen. He was a gifted child and began attending university lectures at the age of 14. In 1727, he graduated with a medical degree at the age of 18. He then travelled to St Petersburg and obtained a fellowship at the Academy of Sciences in 1728. He lectured at the university from 1730, and in the following year was appointed professor of chemistry and natural history. At his suggestion, Johann Amman left Hans Sloane in London to take up a post in St Petersburg. The final two volumes of Johann Christian Buxbaum's (1693‚Äì1730) Centuria were published posthumously by Gmelin.AMMAN, Johannes, Stirpium rariorum in Imperio Rutheno sponte provenientium icones et descriptiones Paeonia anomala L. from Flora Sibirica  The Second Kamchatka Expedition  Gmelin was elected one out of three professors to join Vitus Bering‚Äôs Second Kamchatka Expedition (1733‚Äì1743). During the early part of the expedition - leaving St Petersburg in August 1733 - he was accompanied by the young student Stepan Krasheninnikov. They travelled together through the Urals and western Siberia to Yeniseysk. He described the position of the Yenisey river as a boundary between Europe and Asia and participated in measuring the lowest temperature ever recorded at Yeniseysk. He was also the first person to measure the fact that the level of the Caspian Sea was below that of the Mediterranean Sea. He eventually reached Bering‚Äôs headquarters at Yakutsk in September 1736. Unfortunately, Gmelin's residence burned on November 8, destroying all his natural history collections and notes plus part of his library. The subsequent summer, he made as many re-collections of specimens as possible to replace the loss. His Flora Sibirica (1747‚Äì1769) was based on his observations and collections. It contains descriptions of 1178 species, 294 of which he illustrated. His nephew Samuel Gottlieb Gmelin assisted him in editing the final two volumes. A fifth volume of Flora Sibirica, mainly on cryptogams, was written by Stepan Krasheninnikov, but was never printed. Gmelin also described the journey in his Reise durch Sibirien von dem Jahr 1733 bis 1743 (1751‚Äì1752).  Later life  Gmelin returned to the University of T√ºbingen in 1747 and became professor of medicine and, in 1751, director of the university's botanic garden. His travel description was published there. It was translated to French and Dutch, but not to Russian, \\"because it contained uncomplimentary observations and comments on Russians\\". Gmelin was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1749. The plant genus Gmelina (Lamiaceae) and several dozen plant and animal species are named after him.IPNI query References Complete Bibliography * on WorldCat * Digital edition: Johann Georg Gmelin 1709‚Äì1755 : der Erforscher Sibiriens ; ein Gedenkbuch by the University and State Library D√ºsseldorf Category:German botanists Category:German geographers Category:Imperial Russian explorers Category:1709 births Category:1755 deaths Category:Botanists active in Central Asia Category:Botanists active in Siberia Category:Great Northern Expedition Category:History of Siberia Category:Western writers about Russia Category:Members of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences Category:Full Members of the St Petersburg Academy of Sciences Category:People from T√ºbingen Category:Botanists with author abbreviations Category:18th-century botanists Category:18th-century geographers Category:18th-century German writers Category:18th-century German scientists ","title":"Johann Georg Gmelin"},{"id":"402693","text":"Leopold Gmelin (2 August 1788 ‚Äì 13 April 1853) was a German chemist. Gmelin was professor at the University of Heidelberg among other things, he worked on the red prussiate and created Gmelin's test. Gmelin and his wife, portraits by Jakob Schlesinger, 1820 German postal stamp featuring Gmelin  Life  Gmelin was a son of the physician, botanist and chemist Johann Friedrich Gmelin and his wife Rosine Schott. Due to his family he early came in contact with medicine and the natural sciences, in 1804 he attended the chemical lectures of his father. In the same year Gmelin moved to T√ºbingen to work in the family pharmacy, he also studied at the University of T√ºbingen among other relatives like Ferdinand Gottlieb Gmelin ( a cousin ) and Carl Friedrich Kielmeyer ( husband of a cousin ). Supported by Kielmeyer, Gmelin moved to the University of G√∂ttingen in 1805 and later he worked as assistant in the laboratory of Friedrich Stromeyer, by whom he successfully passed his exams in 1809. Leopold Gmelin returned to T√ºbingen and again heard the lectures of Ferdinand Gottlieb Gmelin and Carl Friedrich Kielmeyer. In February 1811 Gmelin clashed with the medical student Gutike, according to an insult he challenged him to a duel, without serious injuries. Because duels were forbidden among students the incident was kept a secret at first, he nevertheless came to light. On March 10 Gmelin fled and went to Joseph Franz von Jacquin at the University of Vienna. Focus of his research was the Black pigment of oxen and calves eyes, outcome of this work was also the subject of Gmelins dissertation. In 1812 he received his doctorate in G√∂ttingen in absentia. Until 1813 Gmelin went on an extensive study trip through Italy. After his return, he began to work as a Privatdozent at the Heidelberg University since the winter semester of 1813/14, at first he worked on his Habilitation in G√∂ttingen. On 26 September of the following year he was appointed associate professor in Heidelberg. In the fall of 1814, he went on another educational trip to Paris to study at the Sorbonne, he remained there until the spring of 1815. Together with his cousin, Christian Gottlob Gmelin he made the acquaintance of Ren√© Just Ha√ºy, Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac, Louis Jacques Th√©nard and Louis Nicolas Vauquelin. 1816 Gmelin married Louise in Heidelberg-Kirchheim, a daughter of the Kirchheimer pastor Johann Conrad Maurer, the lawyer Georg Ludwig von Maurer became his brother-in-law. Together they had three daughters and one son, including Auguste, the future wife of the physician Theodor von Dusch. When the chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth died in Berlin in 1817, Gmelin should have succeeded him. However, he refused and became full Professor of Chemistry at the Heidelberg University. There, a close cooperation with Friedrich Tiedemann evolved with time. The two published \\"The digestion after tests\\" in 1826 and established the basis of the physiological chemistry. In the field of digestive chemistry Gmelin later discovered more components of bile and introduced Gmelin's test. When Friedrich W√∂hler worked on complex cyanogen compounds in 1822, Gmelin assisted him and discovered the Red prussiate. From 1833 to 1838 Gmelin owned a paper mill in the north of Heidelberg situated Schriesheim, he had taken it over in the hope of profit. However, the work in the mill showed to be very time- and money-consuming and at the expense of his academic activity. In 1817 the first volume of Gmelins Handbook of Chemistry was published. Till 1843 it was grown in the fourth edition up to 9 volumes. In this edition Gmelin included the Atomtheory and devoted much more space to the increasingly important organic chemistry. The terms Ester and Ketone were introduced by Gmelin. Until his death Gmelin worked on the fifth edition of the handbook, which he has made himself worthy of the chemical information and documentation. He also established the basis for the Gmelin system, which later was named after him, for unambiguous classification of inorganic substances. At the age of 60 Gmelin suffered a first stroke, another in August 1850. In both strokes the right half of his body was hit, he was able to recover from the paralysis, but remained debilitated. In the spring of 1851 Gmelin applied for his retirement, which was granted him a few months later. In the two following years he suffered increasingly from the effects of a brain illness, at nearly 65 years Leopold Gmelin died on 13 April 1853 in Heidelberg and was buried at the Mountain Cemetery in Heidelberg. The grave complex is located in the department E. There also rests his wife Luise Gmelin and more family members. Leopold Gmelin's grave on the Mountain Cemetery in Heidelberg in the Dept. E  Work  In his works Leopold Gmelin dealt with physiology, mineralogy and chemistry. His experimental work was marked by his very thorough and comprehensive way of working; also some writing talent is attributed to him. Gmelin's first physiological work was his dissertation on the black pigment of oxen's and calves' eyes, whose coloring principle he tried to fathom. Despite the simplest chemical means he could describe the properties of the pigment and recognized the carbon rightly as the cause of staining. Gmelin's most important physiological work was the 1826 released digestion by experiments, which he made together with Friedrich Tiedemann. The work, which also described many new working techniques, contained groundbreaking insights into the gastric juice, in which they found hydrochloric acid, and bile, in which Gmelin and Tiedemann among others discovered cholesterol and taurine. Introduced by Gmelin, Gmelin's test enabled the detection of bile constituents in the urine of people suffering from jaundice. Furthermore, Gmelin and Tiedemann delivered a new, more refined view of the absorption of nutrients through the gastrointestinal tract; they were the founders of modern physiology. The mineralogical works of Gmelin were analyses of various minerals, such as the Hauyne with which he made his habilitation in G√∂ttingen, or the Laumontite and the Cordierite. In addition, Gmelin also analysed mineral waters and in 1825 published the work try of a new chemical mineral system, since he knew that the time's usual division on outer or physical characteristics was inadequate. Leopold Gmelin's mineral system was taken largely critical among experts, but the basic idea of an order based on the chemical composition proved to be useful. Gmelin released the Handbook of theoretical chemistry, which was continued as the Gmelin Handbook of Inorganic Chemistry until 1997 in about 800 volumes by the Gmelin Institute, and it is continued by the Gesellschaft Deutscher Chemiker as a database. The manual, even during his lifetime his most important work, was initially intended to be a textbook, which should unite the whole chemical knowledge at that time. Due to the enormous increase in knowledge and the associated development of the handbook into a reference book, Gmelin published a compact textbook of chemistry in 1844. His chemical achievements include the discovery of the Croconic acid; he thus had synthesised the first cyclic organic compound, and the previously mentioned discovery of the red prussiate. Leopold Gmelin besides also developed a forerunner of the Periodic table and improved chemical equipment. * Chemische Untersuchung des schwarzen Pigments der Ochsen- und K√§lberaugen, nebst einigen physiologischen Bemerkungen √ºber dasselbe, Dissertation, G√∂ttingen 1812, in Latein.

The advantage of the key over a standard telegraph key is that it automatically generates strings of one of the two pulses from which Morse code characters are composed, the shortest one or \\"dot\\" (dit), so that the operator's hand does not have to make the rapid movements necessary to generate multiple dots. When the knob is pressed from the right, it makes a continuous contact suitable for sending \\"dashes\\" (or dahs, as most operators call them). When the paddle is pressed from the left, a horizontal pendulum at the opposite end of the lever is set into motion, intermittently closing a set of contacts, sending a series of short pulses \\"dots\\" (dits) at a speed that is controlled by the position of the pendulum weight. A skilled operator can achieve sending speeds in excess of 40 words per minute with a bug. The Vibroplex Original Bug key has been in continuous production for over 100 years, with only minor cosmetic changes. Numerous Vibroplex keys are available to this day; the company presently markets and sells 27 variations of Morse code keys, including the Original Bug, iambic paddles, the Vibrokeyer (an electronic variant of the Original Bug) and traditional straight keys.

The largest island, Heimaey, has a population of 4,135, most of whom live in the archipelago's main town, Vestmannaeyjab√¶r. The other islands are uninhabited, although six have single hunting cabins. Vestmannaeyjar came to international attention in 1973 with the eruption of Eldfell volcano, which destroyed many buildings and forced a months-long evacuation of the entire population to mainland Iceland. Approximately one-fifth of the town was destroyed before the lava flow was halted by application of 6.8billion litres of cold sea water. Geography Elli√∞aey island. Su√∞urey, Hellisey, S√∫lnasker and Geldungur islands. Sm√°eyjar islands The Vestmannaeyjar archipelago is young in geological terms. The islands lie in the Southern Icelandic Volcanic Zone and have been formed by eruptions over the past 10,000‚Äì12,000 years. The volcanic system consists of 70‚Äì80 volcanoes both above and below the sea. Vestmannaeyjar comprises the following islands: *Heimaey () *Surtsey () *Elli√∞aey () *Bjarnarey () *√Ålsey () *Su√∞urey () *Brandur () *Hellisey () *S√∫lnasker () *Geldungur () *Geirfuglasker (Vestmannaeyjar) () *the islands Hani, H√¶na, Hrauney and the skerry Grasleysa are called Sm√°eyjar (small islands). Total: There are 15 islands, and about 30 rock stacks and skerries. All the islands have been built up in submarine eruptions and consist of alternating layers of palagonite tuff and lava. The oldest geological formations are in the northern part of Heimaey (\\"Home Island\\"), the largest island and the only inhabited one. Basalt columns can be seen in many places, and the sea has eroded the soft rock of the shoreline and scooped out many picturesque coves and grottos, which are among the special features of the islands. There was a submarine eruption southeast of Hellisey in 1896. The next eruption began on 14 November 1963. It lasted about four years ‚Äì one of the longest in Icelandic history ‚Äì and gave birth to Surtsey, the 15th island in the group. In the eruption of 1973 that lasted for 155 days, Heimaey grew by about . The Vestmannaeyjar group is about long and broad, the closest point lying about from the mainland. Biodiversity Puffin with capelin There is generally very little snow, but a lot of rain. Owing to this microclimate, returning migrant birds are often first seen in the spring and they set out from the islands in the autumn. All of Iceland's seabirds can be found in Vestmannaeyjar: the guillemot, gannet, kittiwake, Iceland gull, and puffin. The puffin is the most plentiful species and is the Vestmannaeyjar emblem. More than 30 species of birds nest in their millions in the cliffs and grassy ledges, and other species make irregular appearances. There are about 150 plant species in the flora of the islands, and about 80 types of insect have been identified. The waters around the Vestmannaeyjar contain some of the North Atlantic's richest fishing grounds. The two main commercially exploited species in Iceland, cod and haddock, are found in abundance in Vestmannaeyjar. Other species, such as flat-fish, herring and capelin, are also commonly harvested as they migrate through the area in the autumn and winter. Lobsters and ocean perch are found in large numbers in the deep water to the southeast of the islands. Seals, small types of whale and other marine species are also present in large numbers around the islands. Climate Gulf stream route around Iceland With extremely high precipitation considering the latitude, Vestmannaeyjar features a subpolar oceanic climate (Cfc) under the K√∂ppen climate classification. It is often very windy in the islands, and the highest wind speed measured in Iceland () was recorded in St√≥rh√∂f√∞i. The main wind directions are easterly and south-easterly. The islands enjoy the country's highest average annual temperature, the Gulf Stream having a strong warming effect, especially in winter.

The Old Norse word Vestmenn, literally \\"Westmen\\", was applied to the Irish, and retained in Icelandic even though Iceland is further west than Ireland. (In contrast, the Norse Gaels often called themselves Ostmen or Austmenn ‚Äì \\"East- men\\".) Not long after Ing√≥lfur Arnarson arrived in Iceland, his blood brother Hj√∂rleifur was murdered by the slaves he had brought with him. Ing√≥lfur tracked them down to the Vestmannaeyjar and killed them all in retribution, hence the name Vestmannaeyjar (the islands of the west men). This is speculated to have occurred in AD 875. On 16 July 1627, in an event known as the Turkish Abductions, the islands were captured by a fleet of three ships of Barbary Pirates from Algiers, who stayed there until 19 July under the control of Ottomans. They had earlier raided the east of Iceland and Murat Reis from Sal√© in Morocco had commanded another raid in Grindav√≠k in June of that year. The pirates captured 234 people from the islands and took them on a 27-day voyage to Algiers, where most of them spent the rest of their lives in bondage.‚ÄûHva√∞ ger√∞ist √≠ Tyrkjar√°ninu?\\". V√≠sindavefurinn, retrieved on 26 February 2012. (In Icelandic.) One of the captives, Lutheran minister √ìlafur Egilsson, managed to return in 1628 and wrote a book about his experience. In 1636, ransom was paid for 34 of the captives, and most of them returned to Iceland. After this, a small fort was built on Skansinn (that is, \\"the bastion\\"), and an armed guard was established to keep watch from the mountain Helgafell for the approach of ships. For centuries, the people of the Vestmannaeyjar had a hard struggle for existence, living from fishing and wild birds and their eggs, which they gathered in the cliffs and rock stacks offshore. At the end of the 19th century, when the population was about 600, great changes took place in the lifestyle of the islanders. In 1904, the first motorised boat was purchased, and more followed soon afterwards. By 1930, the population had risen to 3,470. The Vestmannaeyjar have always been at the forefront of developments in fishing and sea food processing, and are the most productive fishing centre in the country. Shortage of fresh water was also a problem for a long time, but a great improvement took place in 1968 when a pipeline was laid. The area is very volcanically active, like the rest of Iceland. There were two major eruptions in the 20th century: the eruption in 1963 that created the new island of Surtsey, and the Eldfell eruption of January 1973, which created a 200-metre-high mountain where a meadow had been, and caused the island's 5,000 inhabitants to be temporarily evacuated to the mainland. In 2000, Heimaey stave church, a replica of the Haltdalen Stave Church containing a replica of the St Olav frontal, was erected at Skansinn as a gift from the Norwegian government to Iceland, commemorating the conversion of Iceland to Christianity a thousand years before.Paul Torvik Nilsen, 'Colourful Middle Ages', Tell'us: Science in Norway (December 2001), 6-9. Transportation A ferry service from Landeyjah√∂fn (closer) and sometimes under bad conditions √ûorl√°ksh√∂fn (further away) and flights to /from Vestmannaeyjar Airport connect the largest island with the rest of Iceland, making 5-6 roundtrips per day. Iceland has ordered an electric ferry with a 3MWh battery and capacity for 550 passengers and 75 cars for the 13 km route. Popular culture =Festival= The islands are famed in Iceland for their major annual festival, √ûj√≥√∞h√°t√≠√∞ (\\"The National Festival\\"), which attracts thousands of people. The festival was first held in 1874, at the same time as the commemoration of the millennium of the settlement of Iceland. Vestmannaeyjar residents had been prevented by bad weather from sailing to the mainland for the festivities and thus celebrated locally. =Film= *From 1998 to 2003 the island of Heimaey was home to Keiko the killer whale, star of Free Willy (1993). *The film The Deep (2012), based on true events, is set on and around the island. =Literature= * The islands and their history of volcanic activity play a major role in James Rollins' seventh Sigma Force novel, The Devil Colony (2011). * The islands feature as the primary location in Yrsa Sigur√∞ard√≥ttir's novel Ashes to Dust, which uses the 1973 eruption of Eldfell as a key element in the plot. =Sport= √çBV, based on Vestmannaeyjar, are one of the most prominent sports clubs in Iceland, having won several national championships and national cups in both handball and football. The Westman Islands Golf Club was established in 1938 and is located in the remnants of an extinct volcano. Golf Monthly ranks it as one of the top 200 golf courses in Europe.

In this common design, the force from the arm is distributed evenly with a series of linkages known as a whippletree. A common windshield wiper arm and blade A train windscreen wiper in operation (MRT Jakarta) A windshield wiper or windscreen wiper (British English) is a device used to remove rain, snow, ice, washer fluid, water, and/or debris from a vehicle's front window so the vehicle's operator can better see what's ahead of them. Almost all motor vehicles, including cars, trucks, buses, train locomotives, and watercraft with a cabin‚Äîand some aircraft‚Äîare equipped with one or more such wipers, which are usually a legal requirement. A wiper generally consists of a metal arm; one end pivots, the other end has a long rubber blade attached to it. The arm is powered by a motor, often an electric motor, although pneumatic power is also used for some vehicles. The blade is swung back and forth over the glass, pushing water, other precipitation, or any other impediments to visibility, from its surface. On vehicles made after 1969, the speed is normally adjustable, with several continuous speeds, and often one or more intermittent settings. Most personal automobiles use two synchronized radial-type arms, while many commercial vehicles use one or more pantograph arms. On some vehicles, a windscreen/windshield washer system is also used to improve and expand the function of the wiper(s) to dry or icy conditions. This system sprays water, or an antifreeze window washer fluid, at the windscreen using several well-positioned nozzles. This system helps remove dirt or dust from the windscreen when it is used in concert with the wiper blades. When antifreeze washer fluid is used, it can help the wipers remove snow or ice. For these types of winter conditions, some vehicles have additional heaters aimed at the windows, or embedded heating wire(s) in the glass; these defroster systems help to keep snow and ice from building up on the windscreen. Less frequently, miniature wipers are installed on headlights to ensure that they function optimally.  History  = Early versions = Capwell, 1898 One of the earliest recorded patents for the windscreen wiper is by George J. Capewell of Hartford Connecticut, which was filed on August 6, 1896. His invention was for an automated, motorised, wiper for \\"cars, locomotives, and such land-vehicles\\". Other early designs for the windscreen wiper are credited to Polish concert pianist J√≥zef Hofmann, and Mills Munitions, Birmingham who also claimed to have been the first to patent windscreen wipers in England. At least three inventors patented windscreen cleaning devices at around the same time in 1903; Mary Anderson, Robert Douglass, and John Apjohn. In April 1911, a patent for windscreen wipers was registered by Sloan & Lloyd Barnes, patent agents of Liverpool, England, for Gladstone Adams of Whitley Bay. Anderson's 1903 window cleaner design American inventor Mary Anderson is popularly credited with devising the first operational windscreen wiper in 1903. In Anderson's patent, she called her invention a \\"window cleaning device\\" for electric cars and other vehicles. Operated via a lever from inside a vehicle, her version of windscreen wipers closely resembles the windscreen wiper found on many early car models. Anderson had a model of her design manufactured, then filed a patent (US 743,801) on June 18, 1903 that was issued to her by the US Patent Office on November 10, 1903. left A similar device is recorded 3 months prior to Anderson's patent, with Robert A Douglass filing a patent for a \\"locomotive- cab-window cleaner\\" on 12 March 1903. left Irish born inventor James Henry Apjohn (1845‚Äì1914) patented an \\"Apparatus for Cleaning Carriage, Motor Car and other Windows\\" which was stated to use either brushes or wipers and could be either motor driven or hand driven. The brushes or wipers were intended to clean either both up and down or in just one direction on a vertical window. Apjohn's invention had a priority date in the UK of 9 October 1903.Espacenet - Bibliographic data John R. Oishei (1886-1968) formed the Tri-Continental Corporation in 1917. This company introduced the first windscreen wiper, Rain Rubber, for the slotted, two-piece windscreens found on many of the automobiles of the time. Today Trico Products is one of the world's largest manufacturers of windscreen wipers. Bosch has the world's biggest windscreen wiper factory in Tienen, Belgium, which produces 350,000 wiper blades every day. The first automatic electric wiper arms were patented in 1917 by Charlotte Bridgwood. Inventor William M. Folberth and his brother, Fred, applied for a patent for an automatic windscreen wiper apparatus in 1919, which was granted in 1922. It was the first automatic mechanism to be developed by an American, but the original invention is attributed by others to Hawaiian, Ormand Wall. Trico later settled a patent dispute with Folberth and purchased Folberth's Cleveland company, the Folberth Auto Specialty Co. The new vacuum-powered system quickly became standard equipment on automobiles, and the vacuum principle was in use until about 1960. In the late 1950s, a feature common on modern vehicles first appeared, operating the wipers automatically for two or three passes when the windscreen washer button was pressed, making it unnecessary to manually turn the wipers on as well. Today, an electronic timer is used, but originally a small vacuum cylinder mechanically linked to a switch provided the delay as the vacuum leaked off. = Intermittent wipers = The inventor of intermittent wipers (non- continuous, now including variable-rate wipers) might have been Raymond Anderson, who, in 1923, proposed an electro-mechanical design. (US Patent 1,588,399). In 1958, Oishei et al. filed a patent application describing not only electro-mechanical, but also thermal and hydraulic designs. (US Patent 2,987,747). Then, in 1961, John Amos, an engineer for the UK automotive engineering company Lucas Industries, filed the first patent application in the UK for a solid-state electronic design. (US patent 3,262,042). In 1963, another form of intermittent wiper was invented by Robert Kearns, an engineering professor at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan. (United States Patent 3,351,836 ‚Äì 1964 filing date). Kearns's design was intended to mimic the function of the human eye, which blinks only once every few seconds. In 1963, Kearns built his first intermittent wiper system using off-the-shelf electronic components. The interval between wipes was determined by the rate of current flow into a capacitor; when the charge in the capacitor reached a certain voltage, the capacitor would be discharged, activating one cycle of the wiper motor, and then repeating the process. Kearns showed his wiper design to the Ford Motor Company and proposed that they manufacture the design. Ford executives rejected Kearns' proposal at the time, but later offered a similar design as an option on the company's Mercury line, beginning with the 1969 models. Kearns sued Ford in a multi-year patent dispute that Kearns eventually won in court, inspiring the 2009 feature film Flash of Genius based on a 1993 New Yorker article that covered the legal battle. In March 1970, French automotive manufacturer Citro√´n introduced more advanced rain-sensitive intermittent windscreen wipers on its SM model. When the intermittent function was selected, the wiper would make one sweep. If the windscreen was relatively dry, the wiper motor drew high current, which would set the control circuit timer to a long delay for the next wipe. If the motor drew little current, it indicated that the glass was still wet, and would set the timer to minimize the delay.  Power  Pneumatic motor drive on a railroad locomotive windscreen wiper. The lever on the motor operates a valve to supply pressurized air. Wipers may be powered by a variety of means, although most in use today are powered by an electric motor through a series of mechanical components, typically two 4-bar linkages in series or parallel. Vehicles with air-operated brakes sometimes use pneumatic wipers, powered by tapping a small amount of pressurized air from the brake system to a small air operated motor mounted on or just above the windscreen. These wipers are activated by opening a valve which allows pressurized air to enter the motor. Early wipers were often driven by a vacuum motor powered by manifold vacuum. This had the drawback that manifold vacuum varies depending on throttle position, and is almost non-existent under wide-open throttle, when the wipers would slow down or even stop. That problem was overcome somewhat by using a combined fuel/vacuum booster pump. Some cars, mostly from the 1960s and 1970s, had variable-speed, hydraulically-driven wipers, most notably the '61‚Äì'69 Lincoln Continental, '69‚Äì'71 Lincoln Continental Mark III (but not all '70 models), and '63‚Äì'71 Ford Thunderbird. These were powered by the same hydraulic pump also used for the power steering mechanism. On the earlier Citro√´n 2CV, the windscreen wipers were powered by a purely mechanical system, a cable connected to the transmission; to reduce cost, this cable also powered the speedometer. The wipers' speed was therefore variable with car speed. When the car was stationary, the wipers were not powered, but a handle under the speedometer allowed the driver to power them by hand.  Geometry  DKW-IFA F8 \\"Luxuscabriolet\\" from East Germany, using a simple radial design with no visible linkages Lever mechanism of a windscreen wiper. The motor in the middle converts the circular rotation to an intermittent rotation. The lever arms have different lengths, so the stop position at the reverse point is different. Simple parallelogram linkages on a boat windscreen This 1974 Mercedes-Benz 220D uses oppositely-pivoted wiper blades. (Fig. 2) Mercedes- Benz O 405 NH Most wipers are of the pivot (or radial) type: they are attached to a single arm, which in turn is attached to the motor. These are commonly found on many cars, trucks, trains, boats, airplanes, etc. Modern windscreen wipers usually move in parallel (Fig. 1, below). However, various Mercedes-Benz models and other cars such as the Volkswagen Sharan employ wipers configured to move in opposite directions (Fig. 2), which is mechanically more complex but can avoid leaving a large unwiped corner of the windscreen in front of the front-seat passenger. A cost benefit to the auto- maker occurs when wipers configured to move in opposite directions do not need to be repositioned for cars exported to right hand drive countries such as the UK and Japan. Another wiper design (Fig. 6) is pantograph-based, used on many commercial vehicles, especially buses with large windscreens. Pantograph wipers feature two arms for each blade, with the blade assembly itself supported on a horizontal bar connecting the two arms. One of the arms is attached to the motor, while the other is on an idle pivot. The pantograph mechanism, while being more complex, allows the blade to cover more of the windscreen on each wipe. However, it also usually requires the wiper to be \\"parked\\" in the middle of the windscreen, where it may partially obstruct the driver's view when not in use. A few models of automobile sometimes employ a pantograph arm on the driver's side and a normal arm for the passenger. The Triumph Stag, Lexus and several US makes employ this method to cover more glass area where the windscreen is quite wide but also very shallow. The reduced height of the windscreen would need the use of short wiper arms which would not have the reach to the edge of the windscreen. A simple single-blade setup with a center pivot (Fig. 4) is commonly used on rear windscreens, as well as on the front of some cars. Mercedes-Benz pioneered a system (Fig. 5) called the \\"Monoblade\\", based on cantilevers, in which a single arm extends outward to reach the top corners of the windscreen, and pulls in at the ends and middle of the stroke, sweeping out a somewhat \\"M\\"-shaped path. This way, a single blade is able to cover more of the windscreen, displacing any residual streaks away from the centre of the windscreen. Some larger cars in the late '70s and early '80s, especially LH driver American cars, had a pantograph wiper on the driver's side, with a conventional pivot on the passenger side. Asymmetric wiper arrangements are usually configured to clear more windscreen area on the driver's side, and so are mostly mirrored for left and right-hand- drive vehicles (for example, Fig. 1 vs. Fig 10). One exception is found on the second generations of the Renault Clio, Twingo and Sc√©nic as well as BMW's E60 5 Series and E63 6 Series, the Peugeot 206 and the Nissan Almera Tino, where the wipers always sweep towards the left. On right-hand-drive models, a linkage allows the right-hand wiper to move outwards towards the corner of the windscreen and clear more area.

Rear-window wipers are typically found on hatchbacks, station wagons / estates, sport utility vehicles, minivans, and other vehicles with more vertically-oriented rear windows that tend to accumulate dust. First offered in the 1940s, they achieved widespread popularity in the 1970s after their introduction on the Porsche 911 in 1966 and the Volvo 145 in 1969. = Headlight wipers = In the 1960s, as interest in auto safety grew, engineers began researching various headlamp cleaning systems. In late 1968, Chevrolet introduced high pressure fluid headlamp washers on a variety of their 1969 models. In 1970, Saab Automobile introduced headlight wipers across their product range. These operated on a horizontal reciprocating mechanism, with a single motor. They were later superseded by a radial spindle action wiper mechanism, with individual motors on each headlamp. In 1972, headlamp cleaning systems became mandatory in Sweden. Headlamp wipers have all but disappeared today with most modern designs relying solely on pressurized fluid spray to clean the headlights. This reduces manufacturing cost, minimizes aerodynamic drag, and complies with EU regulations limiting headlamp wiper use to glass- lensed units only (the majority of lenses today are made of plastic.)  Other features  Windscreen washer in operation = Windscreen washer = Most windscreen wipers operate together with a windscreen washer; a pump that supplies a mixture of water, alcohol, and detergent (a blend called windscreen washer fluid) from a tank to the windscreen. The fluid is dispensed through small nozzles mounted on the hood. Conventional nozzles are usually used, but some designs use a fluidic oscillator to disperse the fluid more effectively. In warmer climates, water may also work, but it can freeze in colder climates, damaging the pump. Although automobile antifreeze is chemically similar to windscreen wiper fluid, it should not be used because it can damage paint. The earliest documented idea for having a windscreen wiper unit hooked up to a windscreen washer fluid reservoir was in 1931, Richland Auto Parts Co, Mansfield, Ohio.Windshield Freed Of Snow With Alcohol Wiper\\", February 1931, Popular Mechanics article bottom half of page Uruguayan racecar driver and mechanic H√©ctor Suppici Sedes developed a windscreen washer in the late 1930s.Supicci Sedes, un esp√≠ritu creador - La Voz del Interior, 1 January 2001 Since 2012, nozzles are replaced on many cars by a system called AquaBlade, developed by the company Valeo. This system supplies the washing liquid directly from the rubber element of the wiper blade. This system suppresses visual disturbances during driving and so reduces the reaction time of the driver in case of incident.ATZ, Automobiltechnische Zeitschrift, June 2015 = Hidden wipers = Some larger cars are equipped with hidden wipers (or depressed-park wipers). When wipers are switched off in standard non-hidden designs, a \\"parking\\" mechanism or circuit moves the wipers to the lower extreme of the wiped area near the bottom of the windscreen, but still in sight. For designs that hide the wipers, the windscreen extends below the rear edge of the bonnet. The wipers park themselves below the wiping range at the bottom of the windscreen, but out of sight. = Rain-sensing wipers = Some vehicles are now available with driver-programmable intelligent (automatic) windscreen wipers that detect the presence and amount of rain using a rain sensor. The sensor automatically adjusts the speed and frequency of the blades according to the amount of rain detected. These controls usually have a manual override. Rain-sensing windscreen wipers appeared on various models in the late 20th century, one of the first being the Citroen SM. , rain-sensing wipers are optional or standard on all Cadillacs and most Volkswagens, and are available on many other mainstream manufacturers. The rain-sensing wipers system currently employed by most car manufacturers today was originally invented and patented in 1978 by Australian, Raymond J. Noack, see U.S. Patents 4,355,271 and 5,796,106. The original system automatically operated the wipers, lights and windscreen washers. Bladeless alternatives Clear view screen provides a window of visibility, even in rough seas A common alternative design used on ships, called a clear view screen, avoids the use of rubber wiper blades. A round portion of the windscreen has two layers, the outer one of which is spun at high speed to shed water. High speed aircraft may use bleed air which uses compressed air from the turbine engine to remove water, rather than mechanical wipers, to save weight and drag. Effectiveness of this method also depends on water-repellent glass treatments similar to Rain-X.  Legislation  Many jurisdictions have legal requirements that vehicles be equipped with windscreen wipers. Windscreen wipers may be a required safety item in auto safety inspections. Some US states have a \\"wipers on, lights on\\" rule for cars.  In popular culture  In the 1999 television commercial Synchronicity for the Volkswagen Jetta automobile, windscreen wipers were synchronized with events seen through the car windows, and with the song \\"Young at Heart\\", which was commissioned for the advertising agency Arnold Worldwide and composed by Peter du Charme under the name \\"Master Cylinder\\".

As well as theatrical performances, it is more famous for hosting the most prestigious event in professional Snooker. It has hosted the World Snooker Championship since 1977. The theatre was refurbished between 2007 and late 2009 and officially reopened 18 February 2010. History The Crucible Theatre at night The Crucible Theatre was built by M J Gleeson and opened in 1971. It replaced the Playhouse Repertory theatre in Townhead Street. In 1967 Colin George, the founding Artistic Director of the Crucible, recommended a thrust stage for Sheffield, inspired by theatres created by Sir Tyrone Guthrie. Tanya Moiseiwitsch, who had been involved in designing Guthrie's theatres, was recruited to design Gleeson's theatre, as well.Sheffield Theatres ‚Äì venues The architects Renton Howard Wood Levin Architects were employed and the building itself began to take shape in 1969. It was completed in two years, with the opening performance in November 1971. Fanfare, an evening's entertainment showing children acting in an improvised scene, Chekhov's Swan Song with Ian McKellen and Edward Petherbridge and a music hall finale with a Sheffield brass band. This demonstrated the versatility of the stage, which has since been adapted for dance and musical performances, as well as classical and modern theatre. The Crucible Theatre also hosts touring productions and the World Snooker Championship. The audience sits on three sides but no member is more than 22 yards (20 meters) from the performer. Consequently, although it seats 980 people the spectator has an intimate relationship with the activity on stage. Colin George and the administrator David Brayshaw persuaded the Gulbenkian Foundation to finance the building of a professional theatre ‚Äì the 400 seat Studio, which opened with the main house. In 2001, the Crucible was awarded the Barclays 'Theatre of the Year Award'.Sheffield City Council Executive Recruitment ‚Äì About the City It is a Grade II listed building. The building went through a ¬£15 million refurbishment between 2007 and late 2009 ‚Äì opening during that period only for the 2008 and 2009 World Snooker Championships. The Crucible reopened as a theatre on 11 February 2010 with a production of Henrik Ibsen's An Enemy of the People, with the official reopening by the Earl of Wessex on 18 February 2010.Earl re-opens Crucible Theatre Theatre The Crucible is a producing theatre, meaning shows are designed and rehearsed in-house. These productions are normally overseen by the Sheffield Theatres Group. Sports venue The 2013 World Snooker Championship The World Snooker Championship tournament has been played annually at the Crucible since 1977, and the venue has been lauded for creating a special feeling of excitement around the event. Sports journalist Peter Mason, in The Guardian, has argued that while the physical aspects of the Crucible are \\"greatly underwhelming\\", there is an undeniably special atmosphere inside the auditorium which means that \\"against all the modernist odds this relentlessly forward-looking theatre appears to have become infused with memories of the past every bit as easily as if it were a creaking old music hall dating back to the 19th century\\". The Ladies World Snooker Championship was also held at the Crucible between 1998 and 2003 but was eventually withdrawn due to financial difficulties. The venue has also hosted championships of other indoor sports, such as table tennis and squash.

Its narrative can be classified as apocalyptic science fiction, but Vinterberg prefers to call it \\"a dream\\". Unlike the director's earlier Danish-language films, It's All About Love is entirely in English and stars Joaquin Phoenix, Claire Danes and Sean Penn. The production was led by Denmark's Nimbus Film, but the film was largely an international co- production, with involvement of companies from nine different countries in total. It was very poorly received by film critics. Plot In the year 2021, when the earth is devastated by continuous climate changes, with sudden waves of frost (it snows in the middle of summer even in Venice), John, a university lecturer, traveling from Poland to Calgary, stops in New York, to sign divorce papers for his wife Elena. This is a beloved champion of ice skating followed by a very large entourage that takes care of her numerous commitments and all external relations. John is detained one night so he can see an important performance from Elena. The next morning he should leave but Elena not only does not sign the divorce papers but begs him to help her. She doesn't give much explanation but he, still in love, indulges her. John discovers that the young woman is the victim of a strange plot hatched by her own entourage. Three clones, perfectly identical to her, were made to replace her. Officially to relieve her of the burden of an activity that is getting heavier, but the fear is that once the training is over, the real Elena can be put aside. Between escapes and returns, the killing of the clones, the betrayal of his own family members, in the end John and Elena go away first by train then on foot towards a safe place to resume a new life together, but they face the cold storms that they are scourging much of the Earth, dying embraced. The narration of the finale is entrusted to Marciello, John's brother, who in flight over the planet is one of the last survivors but is also destined to perish as it is not possible to land. Cast * Joaquin Phoenix as John * Claire Danes as Elena * Sean Penn as Marciello * Douglas Henshall as Michael * Alun Armstrong as David * Margo Martindale as Betsy * Mark Strong as Arthur * Geoffrey Hutchings as Mr. Morrison Production The film was written, directed, and produced by Thomas Vinterberg over a period of five years. It was produced through Nimbus Film. At a certain point during production Vinterberg called up Ingmar Bergman and asked him to come and help him finish the film, as he felt he could not complete it himself. Vinterberg recalled that: :He roared with laughter and said I had to be out of my mind. There was nothing he was less interested in. And he also said I was an idiot that had not decided fast enough what to do after The Celebration (Festen), which he, by the way, called a masterpiece. It was a very contended conversation. (From an interview in Berlingske Tidende.) Reception The film was not very successful, and critics mostly panned it.Rotten Tomatoes rating: 14% positive. For individual reviews, see box on the right. Richard Roeper called the film \\"like Kubrick with a talent-ectomy\\" and Jack Matthews of the New York Daily News declared that \\"Surely, Vinterberg was high on some inert gas when he embarked on it\\". Dennis Lim of the Village Voice, however found something to like in the film: :It's All About Love is, by any measure, a colossal folly ‚Äì ridiculed at its Sundance '03 premier, supposedly disowned by its stars (rumor has it Claire Danes burst into tears upon seeing the end result) and jettisoned by original distributor Focus. But this $10 million Danish-British- French-U.S.-Japanese-Swedish-Norwegian-German-Dutch co-production is a film maudit for the ages -- rapturous and inexplicable in equal measure.

Russia's victory brought Kabardia, part of Moldavia, the Yedisan between the rivers Bug and Dnieper, and Crimea into the Russian sphere of influence. Though a series of victories accrued by the Russian Empire led to substantial territorial conquests, including direct conquest over much of the Pontic‚ÄìCaspian steppe, less Ottoman territory was directly annexed than might otherwise be expected due to a complex struggle within the European diplomatic system to maintain a balance of power that was acceptable to other European states and avoided direct Russian hegemony over Eastern Europe. Nonetheless, Russia was able to take advantage of the weakened Ottoman Empire, the end of the Seven Years' War, and the withdrawal of France from Polish affairs to assert itself as one of the continent's primary military powers. The war left the Russian Empire in a strengthened position to expand its territory and maintain hegemony over the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, eventually leading to the First Partition of Poland. Turkish losses included diplomatic defeats that saw its decline as a threat to Europe, loss over its exclusive control over the Orthodox millet, and the beginning of European bickering over the Eastern Question that would feature in European diplomacy until the collapse of the Ottoman Empire in the aftermath of World War I. Background =Russian war with Poland= The war followed internal tensions within Poland which indirectly challenged the security of the Ottoman Empire and its ally, the Crimean Khanate. The true power behind the Polish throne was the Russian ambassador Nicholas Repnin and the Russian army, with King Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski being appointed due to his ties as former favourite to the Russian Empress Catherine II. Repnin had forcefully passed the Perpetual Treaty of 1768 between Poland and Russia, which was disadvantageous to Poland geopolitically, challenged the political supremacy of Poland's Catholic faith, prevented reform of the liberum veto, and allowed Warsaw's occupation by Russian troops. Rising unrest led to the massive revolt of the Bar Confederation, which became an alliance of noble, Roman Catholic, and peasant rebels.Herbert H. Kaplan, The First Partition of Poland, New York and London: Columbia University Press, pg 101. In the fortified town called Bar, near the Ottoman border, the Bar Confederation was created on 29 February 1768, led by a landed Polish noble named Casimir Pulaski.Jan Stanislaw Kopczewski, Kosckiuszko and Pulaski, Warsaw: Interpress Publishers, pg 85 While the Russian army heavily outnumbered the confederates and defeated them several times in direct battle in Podolia Ukraine, bands of rebels waged low scale guerrilla war throughout the Ukraine and southern Poland. On 20 June 1768, the Russian Army captured the fortress of Bar but when one band of surviving confederates fled over to the Turkish border, pursuing troops of kolii, including Zaporozhian Cossacks, clashed with janissary garrison troops.Jan Stanislaw Kopczewski, Kosckiuszko and Pulaski, Warsaw: Interpress Publishers, pg 87 Polish revolts would dog Russia throughout the war and make it impossible for Catherine II to keep control of Poland. =Ottoman situation= Mustafa III in his royal robes Europe before the war In the Ottoman Empire, revolts were widespread. Many noble factions had risen against the power of sultan Mustafa III and would proceed to break away from the Ottoman Empire. In addition to this decentralization of the Empire the Ottomans were also faced with the revival of a unified Persia, which rose to oppose the Turks in Iraq.Jay Shaw Stanford, History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey, Cambridge University Press, pg 253‚Äì255. Upon the outbreak of the war the Ottomans seemed to have the upper hand as Russia was suffering from financial strain as a consequence of involvement in the Seven Years' War.Russian Overseas Commerce with Great Britain pg 3 The Turkish Navy capitalized on the inferiority of Russia's navy,Carolly Erickson, Great Catherine, New York: Crown Publishers, pg 277 even though it employed British officers to resolve this weakness. The Ottomans dominated the Black Sea, giving it the advantage of shorter supply lines. The Ottomans were also able to levy troops from their vassal state, the Crimean Khanate, to fight the Russians,Sicker, Martin, The Islamic World in Decline, Westport, Connecticut London: Praeger, pg 70 but their effectiveness was undermined by constant Russian destabilization of the area. In the years preceding the war the Ottoman Empire had enjoyed the longest period of peace with Europe in its history (1739‚Äì1768). Nevertheless, the Ottoman Empire faced internal division, rebellion and corruption compounded by the re-emergence of a unified Persian leadership, under Nader Shah.Jay Shaw Stanford, History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey, Cambridge University Press, pg 2 One clear advantage for the Ottomans was its superior numbers as the Ottoman army was three times the size of its Russian counterpart.Carolly Erickson, Great Catherine, New York: Crown Publishers, pg 2 However, the new Grand Vizier Mehmed Emin Pasha would prove himself to be incompetent militarily.Sicker, Martin, The Islamic World in Decline, Westport, Connecticut London: Praeger, pg The Russian army massed along the borders with Poland and the Ottoman Empire, which made it difficult for Ottomans troops to make inroads into Russian territory. Russian invasion Equestrian portrait of Catherine in the uniform of the Preobrazhensky Regiment Not content to let the Polish enemy flee over the border, Cossacks followed them into the Ottoman Empire. Mustafa III received reports that the town of Balta had been massacred by Russian paid Zaporozhian Cossacks.Sicker, Martin, The Islamic World in Decline, Westport, Connecticut London: Praeger, pp. 69‚Äì70 Russia denied the accusations, but it was reported that the Cossacks \\"certainly razed Balta and killed whomever they found\\".Sicker, Martin, The Islamic World in Decline, Westport, Connecticut London: Praeger, p. 100. With the confederates of Poland and the French embassy pushing the sultan along, with many pro-war advisors, the sultan on October 6 imprisoned Aleksei Mikhailovich Obreskov and the entire Russian embassy's staff, marking the Ottoman's declaration of war on Russia.Herbert H. Kaplan, The First Partition of Poland, New York and London: Columbia University Press, p. 105. After her victories in the war, Catherine II was depicted in portraits dressed in the military uniforms of Great Britain, which was initially a willing ally to Russia because of the trade between the two countries. Great Britain needed bar iron to fuel its ongoing Industrial Revolution as well as other products such as sailcloth, hemp, and timber, for the construction and maintenance of its Navy, all of which Russia could provide.Russian Overseas Commerce With Great Britain During the Reign of Catherine II When the tide of the conflict turned in Russia's favour, Britain limited its support, seeing Russia as a rising competitor in Far Eastern trade, rather than merely as a counterbalance to the French navy in the Mediterranean. While Russia remained in a superior position in the Black Sea, the withdrawal of British support left Russia unable to do anything more than cut down its own supply lines and disrupt Turkish trade in the area. Battle of Kagul, southern Bessarabia, 1770 On September 17, 1769, the Russians began their initial campaign over the Dniester into Moldavia. The elite Ottoman Janissaries took heavy casualties from the Russians at Khotyn but managed to hold on, and the remainder of the Ottoman army panicked and abandoned the field and the Russians claimed the fortress. With the Ottomans in disarray the Russians took the capital of Moldavia (Jassy) on October 7. They continued the advance south into Wallachia, occupying its capital Bucharest on November 17. From the capital of Bucharest, the Russians fanned out through the principality, only later being challenged by Grand Vizier Mehmed Emin Pasha at Kagul on Aug 1, 1770. The Russians routed the Grand Vizier's forces and allegedly one-third of the Ottoman troops drowned in the Danube trying to escape. In 1769, Crimean Khan Qƒ±rƒ±m Giray invaded the Russian held territories in modern-day Ukraine. Crimean Tatars and Nogais ravaged New Serbia and took a significant number of prisoners.Lord Kinross, 'The Ottoman Centuries', page 397 Caucasian front By now, Russia had some troops spread out north of the Caucasus. In 1769, as a diversion, the Russians sent Gottlieb Heinrich Totleben south into Georgia. He besieged Poti on the Black Sea coast, but the affair was mismanaged, and Russian troops were withdrawn in the spring of 1772. It was the first time Russian troops had crossed the Caucasus. On the steppes north of the mountains, the later-famous Matvei Platov and 2000 men fought 25000 Turks and Crimeans. The Cossack village of Naur was defended against 8000 Turks and tribesmen. =Russian Mediterranean expedition= The destruction of the Turkish fleet in the Battle of Chesme, 1770 During the war, a Russian fleet, under Count Alexei Grigoryevich Orlov, entered the Mediterranean Sea for the first time in history. It came from the Baltic Sea and was intended to draw Ottoman naval forces out from the Black Sea.Michael F. Davie and Mitia Frumin, \\"Late 18th-century Russian Navy Maps and the First 3D Visualization of the Walled City of Beirut\\", e-Perimetron, 2, 2 (2007): 52‚Äì65. In Greece, Orlov's arrival sparked a Maniot revolt against the Ottoman authorities. In 1771, however, the Russians abandoned Greece and the revolt was put down. Just outside the city of Chesme on June 24, 1770, twelve Russian ships engaged twenty-two Turkish vessels and destroyed them with the use of fire ships. The defeat at Chesme demoralized the Ottomans, and bolstered Russian morale. Catherine II used this and other victories over the Turks to consolidate her reign over Russia domestically by commissioning medals in honour of the battle. Despite their naval successes, the Russians were unable to capture Constantinople because of Ottoman fortifications as well as European concerns that victory would upset the balance of power. War in the Mideast: Russian fleet movements denoted by red arrows In 1771, Ali Bey al- Kabir, the Mamluk usurper of Egypt, allied with Zahir al-Umar, the autonomous sheikh of Acre, against their Ottoman overlords. The Egyptian general Abu al- Dhahab marched on Damascus, but the Ottoman governor, Uthman Pasha al-Kurji, convinced him to turn on his erstwhile master. Abu al-Dhahab then marched on Egypt and forced Ali Bey to flee to Zahir. Now, Count Orlov, with Catherine's approval, intervened and established friendly relations with the two anti- Ottoman rebels. The Russian fleet provided critical aid in the Battle of Sidon and it bombarded and occupied Beirut. The Russians surrendered Beirut to the pro-Ottoman emir of Mount Lebanon, Yusuf Shihab, only after being paid a large ransom. In 1773, Yusuf Shihab entrusted the strengthening of Beirut's defences to Ahmad al-Jazzar. When the latter began to act independently, Yusuf got into contact with Zahir al-Umar to remove him. Zahir suggested that they enlist the Russians. The Russian squadron, under Captain Ivan Kozhukov, blockaded and bombarded Beirut while Zahir negotiated Jazzar's withdrawal. The latter then entered Zahir's service, only to rebel against him after a few months. In consequence, the Russians occupied Beirut for a second time, for four months, to force Yusuf to pay a ransom.For general accounts of the Russian occupations of Beirut, see William Persen, \\"The Russian occupations of Beirut, 1772‚Äì74\\", Journal of the Royal Central Asian Society, 42, 3‚Äì4 (1955): 275‚Äì86, and Paul du Quenoy, \\"Arabs under Tsarist Rule: The Russian Occupation of Beirut, 1773‚Äì1774\\", Russian History, 41, 2 (2014): 128‚Äì41. Mediation and ceasefire Prussia, Austria, and Great Britain offered to mediate the dispute between Russia and the Ottomans to halt Russia's expansion.Herbert H. Kaplan, The First Partition of Poland, New York and London: Columbia University Press, pp. 119‚Äì20. Austria managed to turn the situation to its advantage by gaining physical land concessions from the Ottomans with a treaty on July 6, 1771. The Austrians maintained their increased military presence on their border with Moldavia and Wallachia, and they increased a subsidy to the cash-starved Ottomans, who had been dabbling in tax farmingJay Shaw Stanford, History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey, Cambridge University Press, pp. 283. Jay Shaw Stanford, History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey, Cambridge University Press, p. 89) and offered unsubstantiated support to the Ottomans against Russia. Catherine II, wary of the proximity of the Austrian army to her own forces and fearing an all-out European war, accepted the loss of Poland and agreed to Frederick II‚Äôs plan to partition Poland. She secretly agreed to return the captured principalities back to the Ottomans, thereby removing Austria's fear of a powerful Russian Balkan neighbour. On April 8, 1772, Kaunitz, the Austrian equivalent of Minister of Foreign affairs, informed the Porte that Austria no longer considered the treaty of 1771 binding. A ceasefire between Russia and the Ottoman Empire commenced on May 30, 1772, but real negotiations did not begin until August 8. The peace talks broke down almost immediately over the Crimea, but the truce was extended until March 20, 1773. Both parties had reasons to expand the negotiations, primarily to do with both sides wanting to keep fighting on a single front. The Ottomans were now quelling rebellions from Egypt and Syria and also faced incursions from Persia. The Russians were facing a revival of a centralized Sweden, which had undergone a coup from King Gustav III. Final Russian offensive On June 20, 1774, the Russian army, under the command of Alexander Suvorov, managed to rout the Ottoman Army near Kozludzha. Russia used the victory to force the Ottoman Empire to acquiesce to Russia's preferences in the treaty.Sicker, Martin, The Islamic World in Decline, Westport, Connecticut London: Praeger, p. 73- Peace treaty On July 21, 1774, the Ottoman Empire had to sign perforce the Treaty of K√º√ß√ºk Kaynarca. The treaty did not overtly take away vast territories from the Ottomans ‚Äì Poland had already paid the price of alienated territory. According to the treaty: * The Crimean Khanate formally gained its independence from both powers (but in reality became dependent on Russia and in 1782 was directly annexed after bloody clashes between the Christian and Tatar populations). * Russia received war reparations of 4.5 million rubles * the Ottoman Empire ceded to Russia two key seaports, Azov and Kerch, allowing the Russian Navy and merchant fleet direct access to the Black Sea * Russia gained the territory between the rivers Dnieper and Southern Bug * the Porte renounced Ottoman claims to Kabarda in the North Caucasus * Russia gained official status as protector of the Orthodox Christians living in the Ottoman Empire, which opened the door for future Russian expansion As a consequence of the treaty, the Ottomans ceded the northwestern part of Moldavia (later known as Bukovina) to the Habsburg Empire.The Russo-Turkish War of 1768‚Äì1774 and the Treaty of Kuciuk-Kainargi at historia.ro Russia quickly exploited K√º√ß√ºk Kaynarca for an easy excuse to go to war and take more territory from the Ottoman Empire. This war comprised but a small part of the continuous process of expansion of the Russian Empire southwards and eastwards during the 18th and 19th centuries.

Origin of the name Battle of Trocadero, 1823 The place was named in honour of the Battle of Trocadero, in which the fortified Isla del Trocadero, in southern Spain, was captured by French forces led by the Duc d'Angoul√™me, son of the future King of France, Charles X, on August 31, 1823.

Palais du Trocad√©ro The Trocad√©ro Palace Le Trocad√©ro The hill of Chaillot was first arranged for the 1867 World's Fair. For the 1878 World's Fair, the (old) Palais du Trocad√©ro (1878-1936) was built here (where meetings of international organizations could be held during the fair). The palace's form was that of a large concert hall with two wings and two towers; its style was a mixture of exotic and historical references, generally called \\"Moorish\\" but with some Byzantine elements. The architect was Gabriel Davioud. The concert hall contained a large organ built by Aristide Cavaill√©-Coll; the first large organ to be installed in a concert hall in France (it has since been modified twice, and eventually moved in 1977 to the Auditorium Maurice Ravel in Lyon, where it is still in use today). The organ was inaugurated during the 1878 World Fair with a concert in which Charles Marie Widor played the premiere of his Symphony for Organ No. 6. The building proved unpopular, but the cost expended in its construction delayed its replacement for nearly fifty years. Below the building in the space left by former underground quarries, a large aquarium was built to contain fish of French rivers.

Within its garden, the old palace contained two large animal statues, of a rhinoceros and an elephant, which were removed and stored during the demolition of the old Trocadero palace, and have been located next to the entrance of the Mus√©e d'Orsay since 1986. Palais de Chaillot Palais de Chaillot Well-known photograph of Adolf Hitler at the Trocad√©ro on 23 June 1940 For the Exposition Internationale of 1937, the old Palais du Trocad√©ro was partly demolished and partly rebuilt and the Palais de Chaillot now tops the hill. It was designed in classicizing \\"moderne\\" style by architects Louis-Hippolyte Boileau, Jacques Carlu and L√©on Az√©ma. Like the old palais, the Palais de Chaillot features two wings shaped to form a wide arc; reclad and expanded, these wings and the pair of central pavilions are the only remaining portion of the former building. However, unlike the old palais, the wings are independent buildings and there is no central element to connect them: instead, a wide esplanade leaves an open view from the place du Trocad√©ro to the Eiffel Tower and beyond.Esprits des lieux.

It was on the front terrace of the palace that Adolf Hitler was pictured during his short tour of the city in 1940, with the Eiffel Tower in the background. This became an iconic image of the Second World War. It is in the Palais de Chaillot that the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights on December 10, 1948. This event is now commemorated by a stone, and the esplanade is known as the esplanade des droits de l'homme (English: \\"Esplanade of Human Rights\\").

He was also the last President of Parliament of Catalonia at the end of Republican Catalan resistance in the Spanish Civil War, before Francisco Franco abolished the Generalitat of Catalonia. He was elected President of the Parliament of Catalonia on 1 October 1938. In office, Irla pushed for cooperation with the allies, Basque nationalists and other anti- Francoist groups, though excluding the communists. He became the President-in- exile of the Generalitat after Llu√≠s Companys was executed. During his time as President-in-exile, he established a Government in exile, and appointed Josep Tarradellas as Conseller en Cap (Prime Minister). He resigned as President in 1954. Early years Josep Irla i Bosch was born on 24 October 1874 in Sant Feliu de Gu√≠xols, Baix Empord√†. He was the eldest of the three sons of Josep Irla i Rovira, and Rita Bosch Anglada. His father was a laborer who later opened a tavern known as Cas Romagu√©. His younger brothers were Francesc (1881‚Äì1961) and Nicolau (1886‚Äì1943), with whom he always maintained a very close relationship, sharing business and political activities. He worked in his father's inn when he was young, and studied at the Academy of Arts and Crafts. He did not follow any higher study, but was self-taught. Irla gradually made his way into the world of business and politics. With his brothers, he began industrial and commercial activities in Sant Feliu de Gu√≠xols. He created the company Josep Irla & Co. using the capital of the three brothers. From this base, they opened a factory, producing cork stoppers, that grew over the years. They were consignees of boats and owned a schooner, with which they traded in wine and cork with Barcelona, acting as customs agents. In 1902, Irla married Florence Bas i Parent, also of Sant Feliu de Guixols and descendant of a family of workers. The couple had no children, but they had two godchildren, Encarnaci√≥ Pijoan, daughter of peasants from a farm from Romany√† de la Selva, and Lola Aymerich, a cousin who was orphaned. Early political career When Irla was young he followed the family tradition and identified with federal republicanism. He and his father were the drivers of the Catalan Republican Federal Center of Sant Feliu de Gu√≠xols. They were also members of the Masonic Lodge. His brother Francis was the leader of the weekly The Program. thumb Irla was a pioneer of Catalan republicanism in the region. In a 1905 municipal election, he was elected councilor of the Municipality of Sant Feliu de Gu√≠xols as candidate of Republican Federal Center. He was second deputy mayor and member of the Government Commission. After several changes he became mayor and chaired the City Council from 1906 until 1910. During his term in office he highlighted creation of public services and works, social assistance, promotion of popular culture and an economically austere administration, faced with the damage suffered in the municipality during heavy rains in 1908. He followed the events of Catalan political life and defined a Catalan nationalist and progressive sense. At the beginning of 1911, he participated in the establishment of the Republican Nationalist Federal Union, in the regions of Gerona and was president of the local branch. Following the death of his father, then provincial deputy, Irla was presented to the provincial election was called to fill the vacancy in the district of La Bisbal. He got the appointment without election for lack of opponents. In the provincial elections of 1913, he was chosen as deputy again, and it happened on until 1923, with the arrival of the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera, provided by the District of La Bisbal. From his position as deputy, he became involved in the government institution: the Commonwealth of Catalonia. He was a major contributor to the first president of the Commonwealth of Catalonia, Enric Prat de la Riba, and after his death, he continued to occupy positions of great responsibility chaired by Josep Puig i Cadafalch. He was also a member of the board of the Fund Credit Communal. With the liquidation of the institutions by the dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera (1923‚Äì30) Irla focused on his business while maintaining some political activity. He always maintained a certain political activity within the small scope of action of that period. Second Spanish Republic and Generalitat of Catalonia Josep Irla and Bosch with his two goddaughters, Lola Aymerich to his left and Encarnaci√≥ Pijoan (Ci√≥n) to his right, year approximated 1953 After the defeat of the dictatorship, with the proclamation of the Republic Irla was appointed member of the Provisional Provincial Committee of Girona. Immediately after this, Catalan President Francesc Maci√† named him Commissioner Delegate of the Government of the Generalitat in Girona. In this position, he favored education and culture, especially targeting the popular sectors, promoted the use of the Catalan language in the administration, renewed action for the restoration of archaeological monuments, became interested in social work, and developed public works at low cost with a high impact on large sections of the population. In the elections for the Provincial Government of Catalonia, an organization was created to prepare and approve a draft statute for the autonomy of Catalonia. Irla and Llu√≠s Companys were chosen vice presidents. Irla was involved in creating the draft statute of autonomy known as the Statute of N√∫ria. On 9 September 1932, the Statute of Catalonia was approved definitively. In early 1932, he created and directed the Federal Republican Party of the Baix Empord√†, a county group created basically to formalize a collective commitment to the Republican Left of Catalonia, which he did in the First National Congress of this political formation. In the elections of the Parliament of Catalonia 20 November 1932, he headed the candidacy of Republican Left of Catalonia in the province of Girona. The victory was total and he was the candidate with the highest proportion of votes in Catalonia. Throughout the republican period, he held various positions of responsibility within the Government of Catalonia. Irla was appointed General Director of the Interior during the administration of President Maci√†, but worsening asthma prevented him from taking office, and he was replaced after a few days by . Having recovered, he was appointed Director General of Industry (1933), under the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Republican Spanish government, in the two successive governments headed by Manuel Aza√±a and Alejandro Lerroux, was dismissed after the rise to power of President Diego Martinez Barrio. In the summer of 1933, he joined the Department of Social Welfare, later becoming Director General of the Department of Social Welfare. In this capacity, he directed projects for the treatment of patients at risk of social exclusion, risk prevention in childhood, and care to retirees without resources. The events of October 1934, with the suspension of the Statute and imprisonment of all members of the Catalan government, put on hold its political action for the next year and a half. In 1936, with the restoration of the Government of Catalonia, Irla regained his place as Director General. However, the start of the Spanish Civil War hindered his political activity. He assumed leadership of the board of the Hospital General de Catalunya. With successive remodeling of the government, he remained in office, but he resigned before the appointment of Antonio Garc√≠a as Director, representative of the National Confederation of Labour (CNT). Soon after, in October 1936, he was appointed undersecretary of the Ministry of Culture, a newly created position, with Ventura Gassol as a counselor. Gassol fled to France, having defended threatened people. Therefore, Irla had to expand his role and worked for the functioning of the schools and continued his support for the preservation of archaeological and artistic heritage of Catalonia. In January 1937, just after President Josep Tarradellas published the decrees which sought to control and provide standards for the entire financial system of Catalonia, Irla was appointed Director General of Heritage and Revenue.  President of the Parliament of Catalonia  On 1 October 1938, with part of the Catalan territory occupied by Nationalist's troops and imminent defeat, Irla agreed to become President of the Catalan Parliament. In his inauguration to the presidency, he said: \\"We were, we are and will be republicans and Catalans, because we are liberals, because it is a feeling of our soul that has led us to feel and know the needs of our people.\\"  Exile  Villa Catalonia residence in exile of President Josep Irla, with his goddaughter Lola Aymerich and a niece, possibly Montserrat. On 28 January 1939, Josep Irla, President of the Catalan Parliament, began his exile. With 62, he traveled to French territory with his wife, his daughter (Concepci√≥n Pijoan), his brother Francis and his sister in law Maria Duran, his nieces and the wife of his brother Nicholas. All their property in Sant Feliu de Guixols were confiscated by the fascist authorities. He lived for a time in Le Boulou (Roussillon) and later settled in Ceret (Vallespir), where he sought his livelihood dedicated to what he did best: the cork industry. In 1940, he was arrested by the Vichy French authorities and confined in Le Mans, where he could escape and return to C√©ret. With the execution of Lluis Companys, 15 October 1940, he refused to travel to America and became, automatically, President of the Generalitat of Catalonia according to the Interior Statute of Catalonia. He was the only modern president who would not set foot, as such, the Palace of the Generalitat. Then, he moved to Cogolin, where he resumed the manufacture of cork stoppers, an activity that provided the resources needed to survive. Generalitat de Catalunya in exile  The first years in office were marked by adversity, with many limitations for minimum performance, resulting from the Second World War, the problem of Catalan refugees and the permanent danger for those who remained in French territory, together with decreasing economic resources. Whilst in hiding, Irla maintained contacts with Catalans scattered throughout France. After the war, he established an Advisory Council of the Presidency of the Generalitat, with the intention of preparing the structures for a future Catalan government. The council included Carles Pi i Sunyer, Pompeu Fabra, Antoni Rovira i Virgili, Josep Carner, Joan Comorera, Manuel Serra i Moret and Pau Padro. During his rule, he prepared the return of the government to Catalonia, maintained relations with the Catalans who had been living in Spain, he was concerned about the situation of the Catalan exiles outside Spain always keeping alive the democratic will of Catalonia, defending Catalan and international reporting the situation of fascist repression in Spain. In this regard, in 1946, he directed a memorandum to the United Nations in which, after exposing the historical reality of Catalonia, denounced the actions of the caudillo Franco against autonomy, culture and economy of Catalonia, asking United Nations to condemn Francoist Spain and recognize the damage done to Catalonia. He obtained a fragile international condemnation that did not refer to the republican legality crushed by the military uprising, nor made any reference to the repression of Catalonia. However, the disagreement between the Catalans living in exile who hoped that the end of World War II meant the end of Francoist Spain, made into crisis his government in 1947 and he dissolved a year following. At that time, he said: \\"The work of the Government can not suffer any interruption and will continue to be exercised with the patriotic spirit of always\\". Since then, the institutional representation of the Generalitat was customized on its president.  Death and legacy Josep Irla died on 19 September 1958, shortly before turning 82, in Saint-Rapha√´l, Var (Provence). In 1981, his remains were moved to Barcelona and received solemnly by the presidents Jordi Pujol and Heribert Barrera. Being celebrated a state funeral in the town of Sant Feliu de Guixols. Josep Irla had a hard face and was not a great orator nor a charismatic character, but was a political manager and efficient, which he connected important sectors of Catalan society at the time (he won every election whichHe presented) and retains the continuity of the Catalan institutions at a time of great adversity. Today, the foundation that bears his name, has undertaken to honor the president and keep his ideological legacy.

He co-founded and served as General Secretary of the powerful Transport and General Workers' Union in the years 1922‚Äì1940, and served as Minister of Labour in the war-time coalition government. He succeeded in maximising the British labour supply, for both the armed services and domestic industrial production, with a minimum of strikes and disruption. His most important role came as Foreign Secretary in the post- war Labour government, 1945‚Äì1951. He gained American financial support, strongly opposed communism, and aided in the creation of NATO. Bevin's tenure also saw the end of the Mandate of Palestine and the creation of the State of Israel. His biographer Alan Bullock said that Bevin \\"stands as the last of the line of foreign secretaries in the tradition created by Castlereagh, Canning and Palmerston in the first half of the 19th century\\". Early life Bevin in 1920 Bevin was born in the village of Winsford in Somerset, England, to Diana Bevin who, since 1877, had described herself as a widow. His father is unknown. After his mother's death in 1889, the young Bevin lived with his half-sister's family, moving to Copplestone in Devon. He had little formal education, having briefly attended two village schools and then Hayward's School, Crediton, starting in 1890 and leaving in 1892.Roger Steer, \\"From the hedgerows of Devon to the Foreign Office\\", Devon Life Magazine, July 2002. He later recalled being asked as a child to read the newspaper aloud for the benefit of adults in his family who were illiterate. At the age of eleven, he went to work as a labourer, then as a lorry driver in Bristol, where he joined the Bristol Socialist Society. In 1910 he became secretary of the Bristol branch of the Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Labourers' Union, and in 1914 he became a national organiser for the union. Bevin was a physically large man, strong and by the time of his political prominence very heavy. He spoke with a strong West Country accent, so much so that on one occasion listeners at Cabinet had difficulty in deciding whether he was talking about \\"Hugh and Nye (Gaitskell and Bevan)\\" or \\"you and I\\". He had developed his oratorical skills from his time as a Baptist lay preacher, which he had given up as a profession to become a full-time labour activist. Bevin married Florence Townley, daughter of a wine taster at a Bristol wine merchants. They had one child, a daughter, Queenie Mildred Wynne (6 May 1911 ‚Äì 31 January 2000). Florence Bevin (died 1968) was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in 1952. Transport and General Workers' Union In 1922 Bevin was one of the founding leaders of the Transport and General Workers' Union (TGWU), which soon became Britain's largest trade union. Upon his election as the union's General Secretary, he became one of the country's leading labour leaders, and their strongest advocate within the Labour Party. Politically, he was on the right-wing of the Labour Party, strongly opposed to communism and direct action‚Äîallegedly partly due to anti-Semitic paranoia and seeing communism as a \\"Jewish plot\\" against Britain.Peter Weiler, Ernest Bevin (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1993), pp. 170‚Äì71 He took part in the British General Strike in 1926, but without enthusiasm. Bevin had no great faith in parliamentary politics, but had nevertheless been a member of the Labour Party from the time of its formation, and unsuccessfully fought Bristol Central at the 1918 General Election, being defeated by the Coalition Conservative Thomas Inskip. He had poor relations with the first Labour Prime Minister, Ramsay MacDonald, and was not surprised when MacDonald formed a National Government with the Conservatives during the economic crisis of 1931, for which MacDonald was expelled from the Labour Party. At the 1931 general election, Bevin was persuaded by the remaining leaders of the Labour Party to contest Gateshead, on the understanding that if successful he would remain as general secretary of the TGWU. The National Government landslide resulted in Gateshead being lost by a large margin to the Liberal National Thomas Magnay.Alan Bullock, Ernest Bevin: Trade Union Leader 1881 - 1940 (1960) pp. 495-97. Bevin was a trade unionist who believed in getting material benefits for his members through direct negotiations, with strike action to be used as a last resort. During the late Thirties, for instance, Bevin helped to instigate a successful campaign by the TUC to extend paid holidays to a wider proportion of the workforce.Ernest Bevin by Peter Weiler This culminated in the Holidays with Pay Act of 1938, which extended entitlement to paid holidays to about 11 million workers by June 1939.Eric Hopkins, A Social History of the English Working Classes 1815-1945. Foreign policy interests During the 1930s, with the Labour Party split and weakened, Bevin co-operated with the Conservative-dominated government on practical issues, but during this period he became increasingly involved in foreign policy. He was a firm opponent of fascism and of British appeasement of the fascist powers. In 1935, arguing that Italy should be punished by sanctions for her recent invasion of Abyssinia, he made a blistering attack on the pacifists in the Labour Party, accusing the Labour leader George Lansbury at the Party Conference of \\"hawking his conscience around\\" asking to be told what to do with it. Lansbury resigned and was replaced as leader by his deputy Clement Attlee, who along with Lansbury and Stafford Cripps had been one of only three former Labour Ministers to be re-elected under that party label at the General Election in 1931. After the November 1935 General Election, Herbert Morrison, newly returned to Parliament, challenged Attlee for the leadership but was defeated. In later years, Bevin gave Attlee (whom he privately referred to as \\"little Clem\\") staunch support, especially in 1947 when Morrison and Cripps led further intrigue against Attlee. War-time Minister of Labour Ministry of Information in the World War II period In 1940 Winston Churchill formed an all-party coalition government to run the country during the crisis of World War II. Churchill was impressed by Bevin's opposition to trade-union pacifism and his appetite for work (according to Churchill, Bevin was by 'far the most distinguished man that the Labour Party have thrown up in my time'), and appointed Bevin to the position of Minister of Labour and National Service. As Bevin was not actually an MP at the time, to remove the resulting constitutional anomaly, a parliamentary position was hurriedly found for him and Bevin was elected unopposed to the House of Commons as Member of Parliament (MP) for the London constituency of Wandsworth Central. The Emergency Powers (Defence) Act gave Bevin complete control over the labour force and the allocation of manpower, and he was determined to use this unprecedented authority not just to help win the war but also to strengthen the bargaining position of trade unions in the postwar future.Borth, Christy. Masters of Mass Production, p. 74, Bobbs-Merrill Company, Indianapolis, IN, 1945. Bevin once quipped: \\"They say Gladstone was at the Treasury from 1860 until 1930. I'm going to be at the Ministry of Labour from 1940 until 1990,\\" suggesting he aspired to have his doctrines remain at the Ministry of Labour as long as Gladstone's economic policies had governed the Treasury's approach. The industrial settlement he introduced remained largely unaltered by successive postwar administrations until the reforms of Margaret Thatcher's government in the early 1980s. During the war, Bevin was responsible for diverting nearly 48,000 military conscripts to work in the coal industry (these workers became known as the Bevin Boys) while using his position to secure significant improvements in wages and working conditions for working- class people.A History of Work in Britain, 1880-1950 by Arthur McIvor He also drew up the demobilisation scheme that ultimately returned millions of military personnel and civilian war workers into the peacetime economy. Bevin remained Minister of Labour until 1945 when Labour left the Coalition government. On VE Day he stood next to Churchill, looking down on the crowd on Whitehall. Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin (left) with Clement Attlee in 1945 Potsdam Conference: Clement Attlee, Ernest Bevin, Vyacheslav Molotov, Joseph Stalin, William Daniel Leahy, James F. Byrnes and Harry S. Truman. After the 1945 general election, Attlee had it in mind to appoint Bevin as Chancellor and Hugh Dalton as Foreign Secretary, but ultimately changed his mind and swapped them round. One of the reasons may well have been the poor relations which existed between Bevin and Herbert Morrison, who was scheduled to play a leading role in Labour domestic policy.Charmley 1995, pp. 184-85 At that time diplomats were recruited from public schools, and it was said of Bevin that it was hard to imagine him filling any other job in the Foreign Office except perhaps that of an old and truculent lift attendant. In praise of Bevin, his Permanent Secretary at the Foreign Office (Alexander Cadogan) wrote, \\"He knows a great deal, is prepared to read any amount, seems to take in what he does read, and is capable of making up his own mind and sticking up for his (and our) point of view against anyone.\\" An alternative view is offered by Charmley, who writes that Bevin read and wrote with some difficulty, and that examination of Foreign Office documents shows little sign of the frequent annotations made by Anthony Eden, suggesting that Bevin preferred to reach most of his decisions after oral discussion with his advisers. However, Charmley dismisses the concerns of contemporaries such as Charles Webster and Lord Cecil of Chelwood that Bevin, a man of very strong personality, was ‚Äúin the hands of his officials‚Äù. Charmley argues that much of Bevin's success came because he shared the views of those officials: his earlier career had left him with an intense dislike of communists, whom he regarded as workshy intellectuals whose attempts to infiltrate trade unions were to be resisted. His former Private Secretary Oliver Harvey thought Bevin's staunchly anti-Soviet policy was what Eden's would have been had he not been hamstrung, as at Potsdam, by Churchill's occasional susceptibility to Stalin's flattery, whilst Cadogan thought Bevin ‚Äúpretty sound on the whole‚Äù. According to Geoffrey Warner: :Bevin's personality was a strange mixture of Jekyll and Hyde. He was adored by his officials, not only because there was never any doubt that foreign policy was made in the Foreign Office while he was its head, but also because he was as solicitous of their welfare and conditions of employment as he had been of those of his union members. His word was universally regarded as his bond and his loyalty once given was unstinting. At the same time, as even his admirers have conceded, he was long- winded, vain, vindictive, profoundly suspicious, and prejudiced against‚Äîamong others and in no particular order‚ÄîJews, Germans, Roman Catholics, and intellectuals of all kinds, groups that, when taken together, comprised a large proportion of those with whom he had to deal.Geoffrey Warner, \\"Ernest Bevin and British Foreign Policy, 1945‚Äì1951\\" in The Diplomats, 1939-1979 ed. by Gordon A. Craig And Francis L. Loewenheim. (Princeton UP, 1994) p 104 online =United States= Historian Martin H. Folly argues that Bevin was not automatically pro-American. Instead he pushed his embassy in Washington to project a view of Britain that neutralised American criticisms. He felt Britain's problems were in part caused by American irresponsibility. He was frustrated with American attitudes. His strategy was to bring Washington around to support Britain's policies, arguing Britain had earned American support and ought to compensate it for its sacrifices against the Nazis. Bevin was not coldly pragmatic, says Folly, nor was he uncritically pro-American; nor was he a puppet manipulated by the British Foreign Office.Martin H. Folly, \\"‚ÄòThe impression is growing...that the United States is hard when dealing with us‚Äô: Ernest Bevin and Anglo-American relations at the dawn of the cold war\\", Journal of Transatlantic Studies 10#2 (2012): 150-66. =Finances= In 1945 Britain was virtually bankrupt as a result of the war and yet was still maintaining a huge air force and conscript army, in an attempt to remain a global power. He played a key role securing a low-interest $3.75 billion loan from the U.S. in December 1945 as the only real alternative to national bankruptcy; he had asked originally for $5 billion. The cost of rebuilding necessitated austerity at home in order to maximise export earnings, while Britain's colonies and other client states were required to keep their reserves in pounds as \\"sterling balances\\". Additional funds‚Äîthat did not have to be repaid‚Äîcame from the Marshall Plan in 1948‚Äì50, which also required Britain to modernise its business practices and remove trade barriers. =Europe= Bevin looked for ways to bring western Europe together in a military alliance. One early attempt was the Dunkirk Treaty with France in 1947. His commitment to the West European security system, made him eager to sign the Brussels Pact in 1948. It drew Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg into an arrangement for collective security, opening the way for the formation of NATO in 1949. NATO was primarily aimed as a defensive measure against Soviet expansion, but it also helped bring its members closer together and enabled them to modernize their forces along parallel lines, and encourage arms purchases from Britain. Britain was still closely allied to France and both countries continued to be treated as major partners at international summits alongside the US and USSR until 1960. Broadly speaking, all this remained Britain's foreign policy until the late 1950s, when the humiliation of the 1956 Suez Crisis and the economic revival of continental Europe, now united as the \\"Common Market\\", caused a reappraisal. =Empire= Bevin was unsentimental about the British Empire in places where the growth of nationalism had made direct rule no longer practicable, and was part of the Cabinet which approved a speedy British withdrawal from India in 1947, and from neighbouring colonies. Yet at this stage Britain still maintained a network of client states in the Middle East (Egypt until 1952, Iraq and Jordan until 1959), major bases in such places as Cyprus and Suez (until 1956) and expected to remain in control of parts of Africa for many more years, Bevin approving the construction of a huge new base in East Africa. Bevin wrote ‚Äúwe have the material resources in the Colonial Empire, if we develop them ‚Ä¶ which will show clearly that we are not subservient to the United States ‚Ä¶ or to the Soviet Union‚Äù. In this era colonial exports earned $150m a year, mostly Malayan rubber, West African cocoa, and sugar and sisal from the West Indies. By the end of 1948 colonial exports were 50% higher than before the war, whilst in the first half of 1948 colonial exports accounted for 10.4% of Britain's imports. After the war Britain helped France and the Netherlands recover their Far Eastern empires, hopeful that this could lead towards the formation of a third superpower bloc. Bevin agreed with Duff Cooper (British Ambassador in Paris) that the Dunkirk Treaty would be a step in this direction and thought that Eden's objection ‚Äì in 1944 when Cooper first proposed it ‚Äì that such moves might alienate the Soviets no longer applied.Charmley 1995 pp. 237-38 In December 1947 Bevin hoped (in vain) that the USA would support Britain's ‚Äústrategic, political and economic position in the Middle East‚Äù. In May 1950 Bevin told the London meeting of foreign ministers that ‚Äúthe United States authorities had recently seemed disposed to press us to adopt a greater measure of economic integration with Europe than we thought wise‚Äù (he was referring to the Schuman Plan to set up the European Coal and Steel Community). In May 1950 he said that because of links with USA and the Commonwealth Britain was ‚Äúdifferent in character from other European nations and fundamentally incapable of wholehearted integration with them‚Äù.Charmley 1995 pp. 246-48 =Cold War= Bevin remained a determined anti-Communist, and critic of the Soviet Union. In 1946 during a conference, the Soviet foreign minister Molotov repeatedly attacked British proposals whilst defending Soviet policies, and in total frustration Bevin stood and lurched towards the minister whilst shouting \\"I've had enough of this I 'ave!' before being restrained by security.Walter LaFeber, The American Age: United States Foreign Policy at Home and Abroad, New York: W.W. Norton and Company, 1994. He strongly encouraged the United States to take a vigorously anti- Communist foreign policy in the early years of the Cold War. He was a leading advocate for British combat operations in the Korean War. Two of the key institutions of the post-war world, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and the Marshall Plan for aid to post-war Europe, were in considerable part the result of Bevin's efforts during these years. This policy, little different from that of the Conservatives (\\"Hasn't Anthony Eden grown fat?\\" as wags had it), was a source of frustration to some backbench Labour MPs, who early in the 1945 Parliament formed a \\"Keep Left\\" group to push for a more Left-Wing foreign policy. In 1945, Bevin advocated the creation of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, saying in the House of Commons that \\"There should be a study of a house directly elected by the people of the world to whom the nations are accountable.\\" =Atomic bomb= Attlee and Bevin worked together on the decision to produce a British atomic bomb, despite intense opposition from pro-Soviet elements of the Labour Party, a group Bevin detested. The decision was taken in secret by a small Cabinet committee. Bevin told the committee in October 1946, that 'We've got to have this thing over here whatever it costs ... We've got to have the bloody Union Jack flying on top of it.' It was a matter of both prestige and national security. Those ministers who would have opposed the bomb on grounds of cost, Hugh Dalton and Sir Stafford Cripps, were excluded from the meeting in January 1947 at which the final decision was taken.Graham Goodlad, \\"Attlee, Bevin and Britain's Cold War,\\" History Review (2011) Issue 69, pp 1-6 for quote.Kenneth O. Morgan, Labour in Power 1945-1951 (1985) pp 280-4Peter Hennessy, Cabinets and the Bomb (Oxford University Press, 2007), p. 48. =Palestine and Israel= The security zone in Jerusalem was dubbed \\"Bevingrad\\" during Bevin's term in the Foreign Office Bevin was Foreign Secretary during the period when the Mandate of Palestine ended and the State of Israel was created. Bevin failed to secure the stated British objectives in this area of foreign policy, which included a peaceful settlement of the situation and the avoidance of involuntary population transfers. Regarding Bevin's handling of the Middle East situation, at least one commentator, David Leitch, has suggested that Bevin lacked diplomatic finesse. Leitch argued that Bevin tended to make a bad situation worse by making ill-chosen abrasive remarks. Bevin was undeniably a plain- spoken man, some of whose remarks struck many as insensitive. Critics have accused him of being anti-Semitic. One remark which caused particular anger was made when President Truman was pressing Britain to immediately admit 100,000 Jewish refugees, survivors of the Holocaust who wanted to immigrate to Palestine. Bevin told a Labour Party meeting that American pressure to admit Jews was being applied because \\"There has been agitation in the United States, and particularly in New York, for 100,000 Jews to be put in Palestine. I hope I will not be misunderstood in America if I say that this was proposed by the purest of motives. They did not want too many Jews in New York.\\"Text of speech by Ernest Bevin at the Labour Party Conference, Bournemouth, 12 June 1946, General Public Statements, FO 371, 52529/E5546 He was merely restating what he said he had been told by James F. Byrnes, the United States Secretary of State. For refusing to remove limits on Jewish immigration to Palestine in the aftermath of the war, Bevin earned the hatred of Zionists. According to historian Howard Sachar, his political foe, Richard Crossman, a fellow Labour Party member of parliament and a pro-Zionist member of the post-war Anglo- American Committee of Inquiry into the Problems of European Jewry and Palestine, characterised his outlook during the dying days of the Mandate as \\"corresponding roughly with The Protocols of the Elders of Zion\\", a Tsarist fabrication written to inflame anti-Semitic prejudice. In Sachar's account, Crossman intimated that \\"the main points of Bevin's discourse were ... that the Jews had successfully organised a conspiracy against Britain and against him personally.\\" Bevin's biographer Alan Bullock rejected suggestions that Bevin was motivated by personal anti-Semitism. Count Folke Bernadotte's funeral September 1948: From left: Sir Alexander Cadogan, Ernest Bevin, George Marshall, William Lyon Mackenzie King. Britain's economic weakness and its dependence on the financial support of the United States (Britain had received a large American loan in 1946 and the Marshall Plan began in mid-1947), left him little alternative but to yield to American pressure over Palestine policy. At the reconvened London Conference in January 1947, the Jewish negotiators were only prepared to accept partition and the Arab negotiators only a unitary state (which would automatically have had an Arab majority). Neither would accept limited autonomy under British rule. When no agreement could be reached, Bevin threatened to hand the problem over to the United Nations. The threat failed to move either side, the Jewish representatives because they believed that Bevin was bluffing and the Arabs because they believed that their cause would prevail before the General Assembly. Bevin accordingly announced that he would \\"ask the UN to take the Palestine question into consideration.\\" A week later, the strategic logic of Britain retaining a presence in Palestine was removed when the intention to withdraw from India in August of that year was announced. The decision to allow the United Nations to dictate the future of Palestine was formalised by the Attlee government's public declaration in February 1947 that Britain's Mandate in Palestine had become \\"unworkable.\\" Of the UN partition plan which resulted, Bevin commented: \\"The majority proposal is so manifestly unjust to the Arabs that it is difficult to see how we could reconcile it with our conscience.\\"British Cabinet Minutes CP47/259 18 September 47, p. 4 During the remainder of the Mandate, fighting between the Jewish and Arab communities intensified. The end of the Mandate and Britain's final withdrawal from Palestine was marked by the Israeli Declaration of Independence and the start of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, when five Arab states intervened in the inter-communal fighting. The Arab armies were led by Jordan, the most effective state, whose military forces were trained and led by British officers. The war ended with Israel, in addition to the territory assigned by the UN for the creation of a Jewish state, also in control of much of the Mandate territory which had been assigned by the UN for the creation of an Arab state. The remainder was divided between Jordan and Egypt. Hundreds of thousands of, overwhelmingly Arab, civilians had become displaced. Bevin was infuriated by attacks on British troops carried out by the more extreme of the Jewish militant groups, the Irgun and Lehi, commonly known as the Stern Gang. The Haganah carried out less direct attacks, until the King David Hotel bombing, after which it restricted itself to illegal immigration activities. According to declassified British intelligence files, the Irgun and Lehi attempted to assassinate Bevin himself in 1946. Bevin negotiated the Portsmouth Treaty with Iraq (signed on 15 January 1948), which, according to the Iraqi foreign minister Muhammad Fadhel al-Jamali, was accompanied by a British undertaking to withdraw from Palestine in such a fashion as to provide for swift Arab occupation of all its territory. Later life Bust of Ernest Bevin in Southwark, South London Owing to failing health, Bevin reluctantly allowed himself to be appointed Lord Privy Seal in March 1951. \\"I am neither a Lord, nor a Privy, nor a Seal\\", he is said to have commented.Francis Beckett, Clem Attlee (London: Richard Cohen Books, 1997), p. 285 He died the following month, still holding the key to his red box. His ashes are buried in Westminster Abbey. When, on Stafford Cripps's death in 1952, Attlee (by this time Leader of the Opposition) was invited to broadcast a tribute by the BBC, he was looked after by announcer Frank Phillips. After the broadcast, Phillips took Attlee to the hospitality room for a drink and in order to make conversation said: > \\"I suppose you will miss Sir Stafford, sir.\\" > Attlee fixed him with his eye: \\"Did you know Ernie Bevin?\\" > \\"I have met him, sir,\\" Phillips replied. > \\"There's the man I miss.\\" A bust of Bevin has been placed opposite Devon Mansions and the former St Olave's Grammar School in Tooley Street, South London. Bevin was offered many honours as his reputation grew, but declined all of them.BBC Radio Four Great Lives, Series 51- Ernest Bevin, broadcast 1 September 2020 Assessments Martin Folly argues that assessments on Bevin as foreign secretary divide into two schools.Martin H. Folly, \\"‚ÄòThe impression is growing‚Ä¶ that the United States is hard when dealing with us‚Äô: Ernest Bevin and Anglo-American relations at the dawn of the cold war.\\" Journal of Transatlantic Studies 10.2 (2012): 150-166. After the opening of the British archives, historians, led by biographer Alan Bullock celebrated Bevin as one of the great men in British diplomatic history.Peter Weiler, \\"Britain and the First Cold War: Revisionist Beginnings,\\" Twentieth Century British History 9 (1998), 131; Anne Deighton, The Impossible Peace. Britain, the Division of Germany, and the Origins of the Cold War (1990). They argued he dominated foreign-policy, led the Foreign Office by strength of character and clarity of vision, and carried through on his grand design for Britain's revised role in world affairs, especially in close alliance with the United States, his support for NATO, and his rejection of an alternative of Britain as a neutral third force as advocated by the left wing of his party. He succeeded in convincing the United States to take over some of Britain's burdens, especially in Greece. He thereby became a major influence in pushing the United States into a leadership role through the Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan, NATO, and the Cold War. However, a revisionist approach appeared in the late 1980s. It portrays Bevin as a narrow-minded anti-Communist and gives more credit to the Foreign Office for the new foreign-policy. In this interpretation, Bevin lost the opportunity to make Britain a leader in European affairs, and it instead became more of a tail on the American kite.Peter Weiler, \\"Britain and the First Cold War: Revisionist Beginnings', Twentieth Century British History (1998) 9#1: 127-138; Anne Deighton, The Impossible Peace.

He translated into French several works by Alexander Pope, Henry Bolingbroke, William Warburton's The Alliance between Church and State, (1736) as Dissertations sur l'Union de la Religion, de la Morale, et de la Politique (1742) and Baltasar Graci√°n's El pol√≠tico. The Prince of Cond√©'s party later used his translations from English to criticize him, but Madame Pompadour's support and vision saw him awarded with the position of Controller-General on 4 March 1759; this was one of the most extensive administrative positions in the Ancien R√©gime, albeit a very unstable one. His task was to curb France's spiralling deficit and strengthen the finances for the Seven Years' War against Britain (1754‚Äì1763). Public opinion preferred his 72-million-livres public loan to the ferme g√©n√©rale, an outsourced tax collection system. He managed to curtail Royal household expenditure, revised state pensions and to encourage free trade he reduced some ancient taxes whilst establishing new ones in accordance with the vision of a unified French market.

On 26 October, he took the war measure of ordering the melting down of goldware and silverware. He was criticized by the nobility including Voltaire, who thought his measures, though theoretically beneficial, were not suitable for wartime and the French political situation. On 20 November 1759, after eight months in the position, he left the court and retired to Bry-sur-Marne, where he set about improving the budget.

Despite √âtienne de Silhouette's short tenure as Treasury Chief, it caused him to become the subject of hostility. His penny-pinching manner led the term √† la Silhouette to be applied to things perceived as cheap or austere.

It provided a simple and inexpensive alternative for those who could not afford more decorative and expensive forms of portraiture, such as painting or sculpture. Those who considered it cheap attached the word \\"silhouette\\" to it. This art-form is still practiced and named silhouette cutting, or art, to this day.

It is located above the village of Batheaston in Somerset, England. The hill rises to above the River Avon, which is just over to the south, and gives views of the city of Bath and the surrounding area. It is within the Cotswolds Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The hill is one of several possible locations of the Battle of Badon and shows the remains of a medieval field system. Part of the hill was quarried in the 19th century. In 1930, it was acquired by the National Trust. The hill was the inspiration of the Peter Gabriel song \\"Solsbury Hill\\", recorded in 1977. A small turf labyrinth was cut into the turf by protesters during the widening of the A46 in 1994. Etymology It is sometimes misspelled as Salisbury, or Solisbury, perhaps because of confusion with Salisbury Plain (a plateau in southern England), or the city of Salisbury. Salisbury and Solsbury can be difficult to distinguish in speech; Salisbury is often pronounced \\"Saulsbury\\", and sometimes the \\"a\\" in \\"Salisbury\\" is pronounced as an \\"o\\", and the \\"i\\" is elided, making the pronunciations of the two words practically identical. The name 'Solsbury' may be derived from the Celtic god Sulis, a deity worshipped at the thermal spring in nearby Bath. A geological map by Horace B Woodward in the back of the 1888 'Handbook of Bath' labels the hill as 'Stilisbury Hill'. Geology The hill is formed in layers from a variety of sedimentary rocks of Jurassic age. In common with the Cotswold plateau to the north, the summit is formed from rocks ascribed to the Chalfield Oolite Formation. The oolite together with the Fuller's Earth Formation which underlies it, forms a part of the Great Oolite Group of rocks of Bathonian age. Beneath these are, successively, Bajocian age limestones of the Inferior Oolite Group and sandstones of the Bridport Sand Formation. The last-named unit forms a part of the Lias Group of rocks of Toarcian age. Beneath all of these is the relatively thick Charmouth Mudstone Formation sequence rising from the edge of the valley floor alluvium. All faces of the hill are subject to large areas of landslip.British Geological Survey 2011 Bath, England and Wales sheet 265 Bedrock & Superficial Deposits, 1:50,000 (Keyworth, Nottingham: British Geological Survey) The high hill is just over to the north of the River Avon. Hill fort Earthworks at Solsbury Hill Solsbury Hill was an Iron Age hill fort occupied between 300 BC and 100 BC, comprising a triangular area enclosed by a single univallate rampart, faced inside and out with well-built dry stone walls and infilled with rubble. The rampart was wide and the outer face was at least high. The top of the hill was cleared down to the bedrock, then substantial huts were built with wattle and daub on a timber frame. After a period of occupation, some of the huts were burnt down, the rampart was overthrown, and the site was abandoned, never to be reoccupied. This event is probably part of the Belgic invasion of Britain in the early part of the 1st century BC. Later history The hill is near the Fosse Way Roman Road as it descends Bannerdown hill into Batheaston on its way to Bath. Solsbury Hill is a possible location of the Battle of Badon, fought between the Britons (under the legendary King Arthur) and the Saxons c. 496, mentioned by the chroniclers Gildas and Nennius. The hilltop also shows the remains of a medieval or post medieval field system. The hill also has two disused quarries, one listed on the northwest side on a 1911 map, and another one listed between 1885 and 1900 as an old quarry on the west side. It was acquired by the National Trust in 1930. People protesting against the building of an A46 bypass road cut a small turf maze into the hill, during the construction of the bypass in the mid-1990s. In one day of protests, 11 people, including George Monbiot, were hospitalised as a result of beatings by the security guards. Wildlife The triangulation station on the top of the hill, with the city of Bath in the distance. The plants and animals which live on Solsbury Hill reflect the habitat provided by grassland overlying the limestone rock beneath. Specialist plants and animals, some of which are rare species, have adapted to the calcareous grassland. Most of the landscape is largely unaffected by agriculture as shown by the yellow meadow ant. Examples of plant species found include bird's foot trefoil, vetches, greater knapweed, harebells, yarrow (Achillea millefolium), and scabious. It is one of a series of flower-rich habitats that Avon Wildlife Trust are trying to link together. The plants attract a range of insects including: the six-spotted burnet moth, hummingbird hawk-moth and a number of butterflies including chalkhill blues. A small population of common buzzard (Buteo buteo) nest in the area. Roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), badger and red fox are seen. Skylarks also nest on the hill. In popular culture Solsbury Hill is also the inspiration for an homonymous song, released in 1977 by rock musician Peter Gabriel as his first solo single. A recording of the natural sounds on the hill forms the track \\"A Quiet Moment\\" on Gabriel's 2011 album New Blood, which precedes the orchestral version of his song.

Geography A small ex-coal mining town, now a light engineering and farming commune, situated south of B√©thune and southwest of Lille, at the junction of the D57, D179 and the D188 roads. History We have to go back to 1141 to find the first mention of the parish of Barlin in a manuscript now kept in the National Archives. It was then spelt Ballin or Bellin. The name changed several times over the centuries: Ballin in 1141, Bellin in 1438 and Barlaing in 1556; it was not until the next century that it became Barlin. In the 12th century, the territory of Barlin was divided into several lordships that depended on Saint-Pol-sur-Ternoise, Arras or B√©thune. In 1207, Thomas Hasbare was seigneur of Barlin. The Melun family succeeded him and one of their lords, nicknamed Le Brun, the king's chamberlain, saw his property confiscated by Duke John the Fearless, who had accused him of allegiance with his enemies. The Duke of Burgundy then donated the land and income of Barlin to Walleran de Juhaucourt. In the mid-nineteenth century, coalmining began at Barlin, and the town flourished. The mines closed in the 1960s. Today, Barlin is a modern and dynamic place that offers its residents numerous amenities: schools, colleges, a swimming pool, a library and sports halls.

Founded in November 2000 on the campus of Western Kentucky University, the group was heavily influenced by other Kentucky-linked bands such as Slint and June of '44. Foxhole has released three albums on Philadelphia's Burnt Toast Vinyl label and in December of 2018 their latest LP, Well Kept Thing, was Grammy-nominated for \\"Best Recording Package.\\" About The band initially focused on melding experimental sounds with melody. A staple of early performances was a fully improvised song (designated \\"X\\") randomly inserted into the set list, and which often featured several homemade instruments, including the \\"juggophone\\", \\"shatterophone\\", \\"topophone\\", and \\"pyrophone\\", which utilized the sounds of beating water jugs, breaking bottles, clinking pot tops, and micing fireworks, respectively. They also made frequent use of the sounds of a signal generator. Gradually, Foxhole integrated slightly more traditional song structures and held to typical instruments, dispensing mostly with the use of gimmick instrumentation. Songs typically featured a gradual build in intensity, and featured rare and unaugmented vocals. 2002 brought EP1, the debut Foxhole release. 500 CDs were pressed and packaged in hand-stitched canvas and embossed cardstock. That summer, the band embarked on a two-week tour across the Eastern half of the United States. In spring 2003 Foxhole released a second EP, EP2:X, a compilation of \\"X\\" improvisations recorded mostly during the previous summer's tour. It too was hand packaged and screenprinted. As Foxhole continued to change musically, the lineup also changed. Founding member Nathan McBroom left the band in December 2003; 2004 brought on a partnership with Selah Records, from Lansing, MI. Selah funded the release of the Foxhole's first full length. Recorded by Greg at the church which doubled as the band's rehearsal space, We The Wintering Tree was a monumental undertaking for the band. Tim Bushong of T-Bush Record Plant mixed the album, and it was mastered at John Golden Mastering. 1000 copies of We the Wintering Tree were released in late 2004 and packaged in letterpress-printed white cardstock. Shortly after the album's release, Matt Wilson left the band, also on good terms. Alex O'Nan, drummer for Louisville \\"math-rock\\" band, Of Asaph, filled in for several shows, as did Adam Tanaka, formerly of the hardcore band With Blood Comes Beauty. In January 2005 the band found a permanent replacement in Jason Torrence, drummer for Nashville Americana act God's Lonely Man. As writing for another EP began, Foxhole also increased the frequency of its live performances. In May 2006 they released Push/Pull on Philadelphia's Burnt Toast Vinyl, after roughly 18 months of recording and pre-production. Recorded by Torrence and Leppert and mixed and mastered by Torrence, the album was thematically inspired by videographer and band friend Aaron Marrs' death at sea. The complexity and additional production on Push/Pull prompted the band to add a sixth member, Brian Toppenberg, to augment live shows. In early 2010, Foxhole announced plans to return from their 4-year long hiatus and record a new album; drummer Chris Vicari (formerly of Nashville post-rock group Maps) replaced Torrence around this time. The band set to work recording at Nashville's Brown Owl Studio in October 2010, with former drummer Torrence serving as lead engineer; however, due to a variety of life events that saw the members disperse to locales including Austin, TX, Louisville, KY and New York City, the sessions were left to simmer for the next few years. In December 2016, Foxhole gathered back in Bowling Green to revisit the recordings, undertaking rearranging and additional recording at Tyler Cook's The Refinery recording studio just blocks away from Shepherd's home; Leppert recorded the final portions in a cabin in Cambridge, Mass., in April 2017. The finished album, Well Kept Thing, was released on Sept. 22, 2018 on Burnt Toast Vinyl. It was mixed by Grammy- winning engineer Stephen Roessner, and mastered by Shellac's Bob Weston at Chicago Mastering Service. In December of 2018, Well Kept Thing was nominated for a Grammy for \\"Best Recording Package.\\" Members * Derek Holt * Adam Moore * Greg Leppert * R.

Carrera was the most important leader of the Chilean War of Independence during the period of the Patria Vieja (\\"Old Republic\\"). After the Spanish \\"Reconquista de Chile\\" (\\"Reconquest\\"), he continued campaigning from exile after defeated. His opposition to the leaders of independent Argentina and Chile San Martin and O'Higgins respectively made him to live in exile in Montevideo. From Montevideo Carrera traveled to Argentina where he joined the struggle against the unitarians. Carreras' small army was eventually left isolated in the Province of Buenos Aires from the other federalist forces. In this difficult situation Carrera decided to cross to native-controlled lands all the way to Chile to once for all overthrow Chilean Supreme Director O'Higgins. His passage to Chile, which was his ultimate goal, was opposed by Argentine politicians and he engaged together with indigenous tribes, among the Ranquels, in a campaign against the southern provinces of Argentina. After the downfall of Carreras' ally, the Republic of Entre R√≠os, and several victories against the United Provinces of the R√≠o de la Plata Carrera's men were finally defeated by numerically superior forces near Mendoza. Carrera was then betrayed by one of his Argentine helpers, leading to his capture and execution in that city. Jos√© Miguel Carrera was of Basque descent. Early years Jos√© Miguel Carrera was of Basque descent. He was born in Santiago, the second son (third child, after his sister Javiera and his brother Juan Jos√©) of Ignacio de la Carrera y Cuevas and Francisca de Paula Verdugo Fern√°ndez de Valdivieso y Herrera. Carrera carried out his first studies in the Convictorio Carolino, the best school in the country at the time. During these years, he became friends with Manuel Rodr√≠guez, classmate and neighbour, future guerrilla leader of the Chilean independence movement. After school he was sent to Spain by his parents. There he joined the Spanish Army in 1808. He fought well against the Napoleonic forces, obtaining the rank of Sergeant Major and receiving the command of the H√∫sares de Galicia regiment. In Spain he also made contact with the United States independence movement and joined the C√°diz Order. La Patria Vieja (\\"Old Republic\\") (1810-1814) When he learned about the Junta de Gobierno that had been established in Chile to rule during the absence of the Spanish monarch, he went back to Chile and got involved in politics. As the Carreras were one of the three major political forces, he became part of the government. On 15 November 1811 the Carreras made a coup d'√©tat and Jos√© Miguel became the sole ruler of Chile (his brothers were military commanders). Because of his more personal and Chilean-national point of view about Chilean independence, Carrera came into conflict with the Lautaro Lodge, whose more Latin-Americanist centered objective was to unite all Latin America in the same way as the United States of America. During his government, he helped create several Chilean national symbols and institutions: Carrera created the first Chilean Constitution, made the first Chilean flag and coat of arms, and promoted the press by bringing to Chile the first printing press, which directly led to the appearance of the first newspaper in Chile (La Aurora de Chile). Carrera also established September 18 as the national day of Independence (which is still celebrated in Chile), even though the real independence date is on February 12th of 1810. He also abolished slavery, rescinded the clergy‚Äôs right to legal immunity, and founded the first state-sponsored school in Chile, the Instituto Nacional. As the Spanish Army and Navy invaded the South of Chile, he became Commander in Chief of the patriotic forces and left the government. He had a successful campaign, expelling the Spaniards from the city of Concepci√≥n. After the Surprise of El Roble, in which Carrera was surrounded and had to jump into a river to save himself (not without first shooting straight at the enemy's head of commander), the government relieved him of his duties and appointed Brigadier Bernardo O'Higgins, who had managed to repel the enemy incursion. Carrera was taken prisoner by the Spaniards but managed to escape, he finally exchanged prisoner after the Gainza treaty, and went on to overthrow the government for the third time. General Jos√© Miguel Carrera Bernardo O'Higgins did not acknowledge Carrera and fought against the Carrerian army at the Battle of Tres Acequias (Carrera's youngest brother, Luis Carrera, defeated O'Higgins using a cunning defensive strategy). During this chaos, the Spanish army retook Concepci√≥n and advanced towards Santiago. Carrera and O'Higgins decided to re-unite the army; Carrera's plan was to draw the Spaniards to the Angostura del Paine (Paine Narrows), while O'Higgins wanted to make his stand at the town of Rancagua. It was settled to make it at the Angostura de Paine, a gorge that formed an easily defended bottleneck, which seemed to be the most logical plan considering that the local forces were outnumbered. However, at the last hour and against direct orders, O'Higgins garrisoned the Chilean forces at the main square of Rancagua. He and his forces were promptly surrounded, and after an entire day of fighting the Spanish commander Mariano Osorio was victorious in the Disaster of Rancagua, (1‚Äì2 October 1814). Argentina and the United States With the defeat of the Chilean forces, many patriots escaped to Mendoza, which was governed at the time by Jos√© de San Mart√≠n. As San Mart√≠n was a member of the Lautaro Lodge, he welcomed O'Higgins and his allies. After committing acts of vandalism Jos√© Miguel and his brothers were arrested and sent to Buenos Aires, where Carlos Maria Alvear, a friend of Carrera since the war against Napoleon in Spain, had just been proclaimed national hero. Alvear would shortly go on to take power in Argentina. While Alvear was in government, Carrera was in a good position in Buenos Aires. But after Alvear was overthrown, power was taken by members of the Lautaro Lodge, forcing Carrera to leave Buenos Aires for the United States. With the help of Commodore David Porter, and by sheer force of personality, Jos√© Miguel Carrera managed to obtain‚Äîon credit‚Äîfour ships with American crews for the Chilean independence enterprise.Long, David, \\"Nothing Too Daring: A Biography of Commodore David Porter, 1783-1843,‚Äù Chapter 7 However, as he arrived in Buenos Aires with this fleet, the pro-San Martin Argentine government confiscated the ships and put Carrera in prison. During his imprisonment, San Mart√≠n organized an army in Mendoza. This group crossed the Andes and defeated the Spaniards in the Battle of Chacabuco, on 12 February 1817. Carrera received help from the United States' envoy who came with him, Joel Roberts Poinsett, and was able to escape from San Martin's forces, taking refuge in Montevideo under the protection of Brazilian General Carlos Frederico Lecor. While in Montevideo, his brothers Juan Jos√© and Lu√≠s plotted against O'Higgins, because of his having betrayed the Carreras to San Martin and the Lautaro Lodge. They were arrested in Mendoza and executed by the command of Bernardo de Monteagudo, after the Royalists defeated San Martin and O'Higgins at the Second Battle of Cancha Rayada. The Lautaro Lodge had already made plans that, in case of defeat, all political enemies‚Äîincluding the Carrera brothers‚Äîwould be executed. After Jos√© Miguel was informed of this, he openly and vociferously began opposing both San Martin and O'Higgins. Subsequently, Jose Miguel Carrera was one of the main promoters of the Argentine federalist war and fought against the Unitarian government. Carrera and the federalist forces defeated the Directorship government and entered Buenos Aires. On 23 February 1820, they signed the Treaty of Pilar, the document that first established the Argentine federal system. However, because of national rivalries, Carrera is not often recognised in Argentine Historiography. As a result of this treaty, Carrera received money and troops, with which he marched towards Chile. One of Carrera's principal allies before his death was the Boroanos tribe that had recently migrated from Araucan√≠a to the Pampas. However, he was intercepted in Mendoza and taken prisoner. Trial and execution After a show trial,, Carrera was hanged on 4 September 1821. Warrior Carrera entered the military career, in Chile, as a mere boy at the age of six. At the age of 22 (1808) he entered the Napoleonic Wars participating in the campaigns of 1808, 1809, and 1810. In Europe Carrera became an elite cavalry officer and a captain in the hussar regiment H√∫sares de Farnesio. He also became commander of the H√∫sares de Galicia. He distinguished himself in the Battle of Talavera and was awarded the Cruz of Talavera. He was wounded in the Battle of Ocana. In total he participated in some 20 armed engagements and battles on European soil. On his return to Chile he led his men in some 10 battles and/or armed engagements against the Spanish Army. Later, following his trip to the US, and in his attempt to return to Chile, from Argentina, he and his men fought the Argentine in a series or armed confrontations and battles some of which were particularly cruel and bloody. Notable in his Argentine campaign was the Battle of Rio Cuarto. In all, Carrera participated in combat in some 40 separate occasions. Legacy Carrera is today considered one of the Chileans Padres de la Patria (Fathers of the Nation). The conflict between followers of O'Higgins and Carrera continues to some extent to this day, when many declare themselves Carreristas or O'Higginistas. Carreristas claim that his figure is not given enough recognition, in comparison with O'Higgins, whom they openly despise. Apart from ending slavery in Chile, Carrera abolished the titled nobility and ended their legal prerogatives and privileges. He also founded the first free newspaper in the nation, La Aurora de Chile; instituted the first national flag and national seal; and founded the first free secular school, which eventually became known as the Instituto Nacional, its full name being Instituto Nacional General Jos√© Miguel Carrera; several Chilean presidents and dozens of senators and parliamentarians have graduated from its halls. In the Patagonian region in the south of Chile, there is the General Carrera Lake. All five of Carrera's legitimate offspring married prominently in Chilean society, and their descendants, who number in the few hundred, make up the bulk of the Chilean upper classes. His prominent descendants include: * Ignacio Carrera Pinto, his grandson, a hero who died during the Battle of La Concepci√≥n, in the War of the Pacific. * Federico Santa Mar√≠a, industrialist and millionaire, who gave his money to build Federico Santa Mar√≠a Technical University, one of the best technical and engineering schools in Chile. In Cinema The life of Jos√© Miguel Carrera is shown through the television project Heroes. The series include 6 related movies about Chilean Founding Fathers and Heroes, and in it, Jos√© Miguel Carrera was portrayed by Diego Casanueva.

The town came into existence in the 19th century, following the rapid expansion of Cinderford Ironworks and the Forest of Dean Coalfield. Cinderford's origins can be seen in the style and layout of the town, with long rows of identical terraced housing similar to those found in the mining villages of the South Wales Valleys. The decline of the coal industry in the 1950s and 1960s affected Cinderford as most of the male population was employed in mining. History The name Cinderford, used for a crossing- point, is recorded as early as 1258. The name reflects the site of early ironmaking which created deposits of cinders (clinker), sometimes in large mounds.Forest of Dean: Industry , Victoria County History Following the construction of Cinderford Ironworks in the late 1700s, and the opening of large mines nearby,Flaxley , Victoria County History the town was laid out on a fairly conventional urban plan.Forest of Dean: Introduction , Victoria County History In 1841 there were two inns and at least ten beerhouses in and around Cinderford.Forest of Dean: Social life , Victoria County History A new church was consecrated at Cinderford in 1844 and dedicated to St. John the Evangelist.Forest of Dean: Churches , Victoria County History By 1843 Cinderford also had a Baptist church which became by far the largest Baptist meeting in the Forest of Dean.Forest of Dean: Protestant nonconformity , Victoria County History Methodists and Primitive Methodists also had chapels in the area, and there was even an iron building which became known as the Ark, which was registered in 1886 by a group called the Blue Ribbon Gospel Army. A coke-fired furnace was established in around 1797. It was situated 800 metres north of Cinderford bridge and used coke brought from Broadmoor, to the north, by a short canal. The furnace struggled to compete with iron furnaces elsewhere, and fell idle ten years later. It was revived in 1829 when new works on the old site were established by the Forest of Dean Iron Company, and in 1841 there were three furnaces producing 12,000 tons of iron a year and employing 100 men and boys. Only one furnace at the works was in blast in 1890 and the works closed in 1894. The Bridge Inn, Cinderford, now closed and demolished. By the 1840s Cinderford had a number of foundries and small engineering firms supplying the mining industry with machine parts, and it remained a centre for metal industries in the early 20th century. For many years coal mining was the principal industry in the area. Lightmoor coal mine was being deepened in the late 1830s. Trafalgar colliery which was in production in 1860, was the only large mine in the coalfield run by free miners in the later 19th century. Trafalgar closed in 1925. A deep mine, called Northern United, was begun north-west of Cinderford in 1933, but Lightmoor, with a workforce of 600 in 1934, was the main colliery in the Cinderford area until it closed in 1940. There were still many smaller collieries in the Forest of Dean, employing 84.5 per cent of the adult male population in the Cinderford area, until the industry declined in the 1960s. Iron ore mines were also worked near the town in the 19th century until the closure of the Cinderford ironworks led to the abandonment of Buckshaft and other ore mines near the town in 1899. Governance There are 2 electoral wards in Cinderford. Education =Primary= Cinderford has three primary schools; Steam Mills Primary School, on Steam Mills Road, St. White's Primary School, on St. Whites Road, and Forest View Primary School based on Latimer Road. Forest View Primary School is an amalgamation of the Latimer Junior School and the Bilson Infants' School (formerly on Station Street). =Secondary= Cinderford has a single, relatively small secondary school on Causeway Road, currently called The Forest High School but previously known as Heywood Community School. The school existed as Double View Secondary Modern School on a previous campus, on Woodville Road, but moved to the Causeway Road campus, in the early-mid-1970s. Up until 1979 it was split between the two sites, in the mid-1980s it changed its name from Double View to Heywood Community School and in 2012 it became an academy called Forest E-ACT Academy. The name changed again to Forest Academy in 2014 and to the current name in 2015. =Tertiary= Opened in 2018, Gloucestershire College is situated beside the Forest Vale Industrial Estate. Transport Cinderford's High Street and Belle Vue Road lie on the A4151, which links with the A48 (Gloucester-Chepstow road) to the east. In former times, Cinderford had a railway station that was opened by the Severn and Wye Railway and later run by the Great Western Railway and Midland Railway as Cinderford Joint railway station, but this was axed in 1958. Cinderford is served by a regular bus service to Gloucester and Coleford, the bus station was dismantled in the late 1980s and no longer exists. Details of local bus destinations from Cinderford can be found here. The closest airports are in Staverton (between Gloucester and Cheltenham), as well as Bristol Airport and Cardiff Airport. Religion The Church of England benefice of Cinderford with Littledean consists of five churches in three parishes. The Parish of St Stephen's with Bilson Mission covers the central town and northern parts of Cinderford. The Parish of St John the Evangelist covers the south of Cinderford, Ruspidge and Soudley with St Michael's Chapel of Ease in Soudley Village.

This has long since disappeared, but the groundworks of the ancient manor house still remain and are a goldmine of archaeological finds. There is also a ruined mock-fortified building, Dinton Castle also known as Dinton Folly, though this was constructed much later (in 1769) by Sir John Vanhattem. This octagonal folly or \\"sham castle\\" is a Grade II listed building. A BBC article stated that the building was beside a Saxon burial ground. Another source indicates that over the past centuries, and into the 20th century, various artifacts and skeletons had been found near the structure. That report also states that there are 14 other listed buildings nearby, including Dinton Hall.Written Scheme of Investigation for a programme of archaeological observation, investigation, recording, publication and archiving at Dinton Castle, Dinton, Buckinghamshire A full restoration of the \\"castle\\" was completed in 2018.A minature 18th century castle large enough to house a small family, with a panoramic roof terrace and far-reaching views Church of St Peter and St Paul The 12th century parish church of Saints Peter and Paul is a grade I listed building. Next to the church is Dinton Hall; this fine many-gabled mansion altered at various periods during its long history, was until the last quarter of the 20th century the seat of the Currie family and is now owned by the Vanbergen family. Following the Curries' departure it was bought by a Mr. Smith. He carried out a programme of restoration, and placed his own coat of arms above the mansion's portals. Since 2004 the mansion is owned by the Vanbergen family, and they have restored the mansion and brought in new facilities. A notable resident of Dinton in the seventeenth century was John Biggs, the Dinton Hermit, who lived in a cave in the village. He was involved in the execution of King Charles I on 30 January 1649 and was reputed to have been the actual executioner.Dinton Folly, Bucks, June 2016 As one of the regicides, Simon Mayne, lived at Dinton, and was after his death in imprisonment buried at Dinton in 1661, it is possible that the executioner would have been given sanctuary and anonymity on one of the regicide's estates. Within the parish border lay the hamlets of Westlington, Ford, Upton, Waldridge, Gibraltar and Aston Mullins. There was also anciently a hamlet called Moreton in this parish, though today only the groundworks and ponds remain. This hamlet was wiped out sometime in the sixteenth century. The name mort / ton (death (fr) / town) is a signal that this settlement could have been wiped out and then subsequently abandoned after the inhabitants succumbed to the Black Death.

It is in the western part of the county, about north of the Oxfordshire market town of Thame. Manor The village toponym is derived from the Old English for \\"farm at a narrow pass\\". The Domesday Book of 1086 records it as Dortone, and in the 13th century it was Durtone. Before the Norman conquest of England Alric, son of Goding, a thegn of Edward the Confessor, held the manor of Dorton. However, the Domesday Book records that by 1086 the Norman baron Walter Giffard held it. Dorton House is a Grade I listed Jacobean mansion to the south of the village. It is now a preparatory school, Ashfold School. Parish church The Church of England parish church of Saint John the Evangelist was originally a chapel of ease to nearby Chilton. St. John's has been a parish in its own right since at least 1590. The nave and chancel of the church building may be 12th century, as is the bowl of the font. There is a 13th-century lancet window in the nave. The south porch was added in the 13th century, es evidenced by a blocked window of that date in its east wall. In the 14th century the Decorated Gothic south aisle was added, the chancel arch was at least partly rebuilt and the present east window and piscina were added. The present stained glass in the east window is 15th century. The present entrance arch to the porch was added in the 15th century, the base of the font is from the same century and the Perpendicular Gothic window in the south wall of the south aisle was added in about 1480. St. John's has three bells hung in a timber-framed bell-cot, plus a small Sanctus bell. Bartholomew Atton of Buckingham cast the tenor bell in 1604 and Robert Atton cast the second bell in 1626. John Taylor and Sons cast the treble bell in 1828, presumably at the bell-foundry they then had at Oxford. Economic and social history Dorton Spa, a chalybeate spring, is north of the village in Spa Wood. A large pump room and health spa were opened in about 1840 but due to lack of Royal patronage (unlike Royal Leamington Spa and Royal Tunbridge Wells) Dorton Spa declined. Little exists of it now. The Great Western Railway had the \\"Bicester cut-off\\" railway built through the parish in 1910. The line passes within a few yards of the village, and in 1937 the GWR opened to serve it. British Railways closed the halt in 1963. The railway is now part of the Chiltern Main Line. Dorton was noted in the 1960s and 1970s for the tug-of-war team the Dorton Dons.

It is high in the Chiltern Hills, overlooking the town of High Wycombe, although today it is almost indistinguishable from the urban spread of the latter town. The central part of the parish is the common, this extends over about . It is part of the Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Downley was originally within the 1890s civil parish of West Wycombe, however, in the 1930s West Wycombe village was incorporated into the Borough of High Wycombe and the remainder of the original civil West Wycombe Parish, which included Downley, became known as West Wycombe Rural Detached Parish. Due to Local Government reorganisation in the 1980s West Wycombe Rural Detached Parish was split into two civil Parishes, one of which was Downley Parish, the other being Piddington & Wheeler End. Downley was once three hamlets, Downley was the largest, with Littleworth and Plummer's Green on its south side. Both of these have now been incorporated into Downley as a whole, but there are still names such as Littleworth Road and Plomer Hill. Plomer is a derivative from Plummer. Downley was extensively built up in the 1950s-1960s and is still changing now, with the parish boundary being extended. The Memorial Hall, also known as the Village Hall, in the High Street was built in 1923 and is still in use. The old School, built in the 1870s is also still in use. There were also furniture making factories in the village as well as home workshops; a practice which was common in the Chilterns as High Wycombe and surrounding towns were large producers of furniture, in particular chairs from the Industrial Revolution onwards. Downley was once home to several farms, the largest of these stopped working in the 1990s but can be plainly seen from commonside with its huge barns and unusual listed farm house. Toponym The toponym \\"Downley\\" is derived from the Old English words dun (\\"wood\\") or down (\\"hill\\") and lea (\\"clearing\\").Hughenden Downley Walk This indicates that the Anglo-Saxons found this area of the Chilterns to be wooded and that Downley was a clearing. Archaeology of Downley Common - Local Heritage Initiative The Common One of the few Chiltern commons that has remained open in the area, rather than become wooded. The common was once part of an Anglo-Saxon tithing, or group of ten dwellings.Anglo-Saxon archaeology Downley Bucks: Something else that makes this common unusual is the way it has been changed by its industrial past. The biggest change in its landscape is the excavation of clay, chalk and flint from all over the common, this has left behind pits, called dells, some very large and deep. The reason the clay was extracted is slightly vague but is most likely for making bricks and tiles. The smaller pits that are round, usually made on a boundary ditch are saw pits. These are identifiable as the spoil heap is on the downward slope. Also noticeable, mainly in the woods are ancient parish boundaries. These once separated the land between Hughenden and West Wycombe parishes. During World War II the Army used the common to test and repair Churchill tanks. The tracks are still visible, but are hard to make out, on the common today. Downley Common was used as a golf course for a short while, hence the name of Golf Link Cottages and the Bricklayers Arms once being called the Golf Links. At the top of the common next to the cricket pavilion there is a small but distinct Blacksmiths Forge. This was still in use up until the early 1990s. Downley is also home to the rare starfruit flower which has been known to grow on Mannings Pond. The welfare of the common is maintained by the Downley Common Preservation Society. Downley Common also plays host to a number of sports clubs, mainly Downley Cricket Club and Downley Albion Football Club. History The oldest house in the village, Blacksmiths Cottage is situated on the top end of the common, dates from the 12th or 13th century. The oldest pub in Downley is The Le De (not Lady) Spencers Arms at the very top of the common. It's known to the locals as the Lee Dee, The Shed or the Top Pub. The building dates from the 17th century and was once a bakery. It is believed to have been a watering hole for drovers who passed through from Wales on their way to London. West Wycombe estate still leaves its mark on Downley life, there is a large, regular shoot, mostly held on Saturdays during hunting season. This is managed by Cookshall Farm, which is in the parish at the very top end. Folklore and events Downley has a few interesting road names, such as \\"Bug Alley\\" which is now Moor Lane, Coffin Lane which is at the end of Moor Lane and leads to Hughenden Church. Kiln Pond Lane, where apparently a horse and cart reputedly ran into the Kiln Pond. Downley traditions include the Guy Fawkes Night torch parade, where literally hundreds of people march up the common with tin can torches and throw then into the bonfire. Also there are two Village fetes, one being Downley day and the other being the Jolities which is the older. Downley also claims a strong sporting heritage. With well established cricket and football teams who use the cricket pitch and newly gained space next to Mannings field. Schools The Downley School (or TDS) is a combined school in Downley with 'Outstanding status' (Ofsted), which teaches pupils from ages 4‚Äì11 (Years 1-6 in the British educational system). Football Club Downley has several local football teams ranging from junior side Downley Dynamos all the way up to the oldest club in the village, Downley Albion Football Club formed in 1885. Both the Dynamos and Albion play home games at Downley Common and share the sports pavilion which is also used by the local cricket team.

It is in the east of the county bordering Hertfordshire, about six miles from Aylesbury and two miles from Tring. History The village toponym is derived from the Old English for \\"farm where sledges are used\\". It is a common place name in England, and refers to places that were perched on the hillside, thus requiring the use of a sledge rather than a cart to pull heavy loads. The suffix 'Beauchamp' refers to the ancient manorial family of the parish. The village is intersected by the Icknield Way a prehistoric, long-distance trackway of significant importance in providing a trading route between East Anglia and the Thames Valley certainly during the Iron Age and maybe earlier. In more recent times it has been bisected by the Roman Road, Akeman Street now the A41 and by both the Aylesbury Arm and Wendover Arm of the Grand Union Canal. Following the Norman conquest of England William I awarded land which later became known as Drayton Beauchamp to Robert, Earl of Morton who as Magno le Breton had accompanied William at the time of the Norman Invasion in 1066. The Morton family founded a church at Drayton on the site where the present-day church of St Mary the Virgin now stands. During the early part of the 13th century the manor was owned by William de Beauchamp (de Bello Campo). The lands were passed from the Beauchamp family to the Cobhams. Sir John Cobham gave the property to King Edward III. The King granted it to his shield-bearer Thomas Cheney (also spelt Cheyne) in 1364. It remained in the Cheyne family until the death of William Cheyne, Lord Viscount Newhaven in 1728. During the period after 1066 in which the Lord of the Manor of Drayton was Magno le Breton the southern end of the manor would have been valued for its summer pasture. This area which became known later as Cholesbury contained a large Iron Age Hillfort. This gradually became a permanent settlement and was subsequently separated off as a separate manor. In 1541 it was sold by Robert Cheyne to Chief Justice John Baldwin and became an autonomous manor. Drayton Beauchamp was sold by the Cheyne family to John Gumley in 1728 for ¬£22,200 and in 1788 the Lordship of the Manor was inherited by Lady Robert Manners. The manor house beside the church had been demolished around 1760 and a new one built elsewhere in the parish by the Gumleys. In 1835 the Lordship of the Manor passed to Mrs. Caroline Jenney and remained in that family until the death of Miss Airmyne Harpur-Crewe in 1999. The parish church was extensively rebuilt in the 15th century from materials salvaged from an earlier church. Most notable is the Norman font which dates back to the 12th century. The first rector of the new Church was Richard Hooker who took up his incumbency in 1584. Richard is today remembered for his writings in particular a four-volume work known as Of the Lawes of Ecclesiastical Politie. The church was again restored in 1867'Parishes: Drayton Beauchamp', A History of the County of Buckingham: Volume 3 (1925), pp. 341‚Äì345. URL: Date accessed: 2 December 2010 when the rector was the naturalist, Henry Harpur Crewe. In 1934 Drayton Beauchamp ceded a small parcel of land, adjacent to the previously detached parish of Cholesbury to the new parish of Cholesbury-cum-St Leonards.

Following the 1549 battle of Danki, its vassal states were fully or de facto independent; in this period it is known as the Jolof Kingdom. Origins Traditional accounts among the Wolof agree that the founder of the state and later empire was the possibly mythical Ndiadiane Ndiaye (also spelled Njaajaan Njaay). Traditional stories of the ancestry of this leader vary. According to James Searing, the myth says that he was \\"the first and only son of a noble and saintly ‚ÄúArab‚Äù father Abdu Darday and a ‚ÄúTukuler‚Äù woman, Fatamatu Sall.\\" This gave him an Almoravid Islamic lineage and a link on his mother's side to Takrur. James Searing adds that \\"In all versions of the myth, Njaajaan Njaay speaks his first words in Pulaar rather than Wolof, emphasizing once again his character as a stranger of noble origins.\\" On his origin, Sallah writes: \\"Some say that Njajan Njai was a mysterious person of Fulani origin. Others say he was a Serer prince.\\"Sallah, Tijan M., Wolof: (Senegal), The Rosen Publishing Group, Inc (1995), p. 21 It has been suggested that the foundations of the empire were set down by the voluntary association of several small states beginning with Waalo in the north and that just prior to the empire's formation, Waalo was divided into villages ruled by separate kings using the Serer title Lamane. Ndiadiane was born Ahmad Abu Bakr, also called Ahmadu Abubakar. The legend of Ndiadiane Ndiaye begins with a dispute over wood near a prominent lake. This almost led to bloodshed among the rulers but was stopped by the mysterious appearance of a stranger from the lake. The stranger divided the wood fairly and disappeared, leaving the people in awe. The people then feigned a second dispute and kidnapped the stranger when he returned. They offered him the kingship of their land and convinced him to do so and become mortal by offering him a beautiful woman to marry. When these events were reported to the ruler of the Sine, also a great magician, he is reported to have exclaimed \\"Ndiadiane Ndiaye\\" in his native Serer language in amazement. The ruler of the Kingdom of Sine (Maad a Sinig Maysa Wali) then suggested all rulers between the Senegal River and the Gambia River voluntarily submit to this man, which they did. Fearing writes that \\"Most versions of the myth explain how the new dynasty superimposed itself upon a preexisting social structure dominated by the Laman, Wolof elders who claimed \\"ownership\\" of the land as the descendants of the founders of village communities. The laman retained many of their functions under the new monarchical order, becoming a kind of lesser nobility within the new state, and serving as electors when the time came to choose a new king from the Njaay dynasty.\\" John Donnelly Fage suggests, however, dates in the early 13th century (and others say the 12th century) are usually ascribed to this king and the founding of the empire, a more likely scenario is \\"that the rise of the empire was associated with the growth of Wolof power at the expense of the ancient Sudanese state of Takrur, and that this was essentially a fourteenth-century development.\\" Early history Jolof kingdom after its disintegration The new state of Djolof, named for the central province where the king resided, was a vassal of the Mali Empire for much of its early history. Djolof remained within that empire's sphere of influence until the latter half of the 14th century. During a succession dispute in 1360 between two rival lineages within the Mali Empire's royal bloodline, the Jolof became permanently independent. A close examination of Jolof's societal and political structure reveals that at least some of its institutions may have been borrowed directly or developed alongside those of its larger predecessor. Society in Imperial Jolof The Portuguese arrived in the Jolof Empire between 1444 and 1510, leaving detailed accounts of a very advanced political system. There was a developed hierarchical system involving different classes of royal and non-royal nobles, free men, occupational castes, and slaves. Occupational castes included blacksmiths, jewelers, tanners, tailors, musicians, and griots. Smiths were important to the society for their ability to make weapons of war as well as their trusted status for mediating disputes fairly. Griots were employed by every important family as chroniclers and advisors, without whom much of early Jolof history would be unknown. Jolof's nobility were nominally animists, but some combined this with Islam. However, Islam had not dominated Wolof society until about the 19th century. Women in Imperial Jolof Throughout the different classes, intermarriage was rarely allowed. Women could not marry upwards, and their children did not inherit the father's superior status. However, women had some influence and role in government. The Linger or Queen Mother was head of all women and very influential in state politics. She owned several villages that cultivated farms and paid tribute directly to her. There were also other female chiefs whose main task was judging cases involving women. In the empire's most northern state of Walo, women could aspire to the office of Bur and rule the state. Political organization The Jolof Empire was organized as five coastal kingdoms from north to south, which included Waalo, Kayor, Baol, Sine and Kingdom of Saloum. All of these states were tributary to the land-locked state of Jolof. The ruler of Jolof was known as the Bour ba, and ruled from the capital of Lingu√®re. Each Wolof state was governed by its ruler appointed from the descendants of the founder of the state. State rulers were chosen by their respective nobles, while the Bour was selected by a college of electors which also included the rulers of the five kingdoms. There was the Bour of Waalo, the Damel of Kayor, the Teny (or Teigne) of Baol, as well as the two Lamanes of the Serer states of Sine and Saloum. Each ruler had practical autonomy but was expected to cooperate with the Bour on matters of defense, trade, and provision of imperial revenue. Once appointed, officeholders went through elaborate rituals to both familiarize themselves with their new duties and elevate them to a divine status. From then on, they were expected to lead their states to greatness or risk being declared unfavored by the gods and being deposed. The stresses of this political structure resulted in a very autocratic government where personal armies and wealth often superseded constitutional values. Serer tradition says that the Kingdom of Sine never paid tribute to Ndiadiane Ndiaye nor any his descendants at Jolof. It further states that the Sine was never subjugated by Jolof and that the probably mythical Ndiadiane himself received his name from the mouth of Maysa Wali (king of Sine). Sylviane Diouf states that \\"Each vassal kingdom‚ÄîWalo, Takrur, Kayor, Baol, Sine, Salum, Wuli, and Niani‚Äîrecognized the hegemony of Jolof and paid tribute.\\" Contact with Europe After an initially hostile start, peaceful trade relations were established between the Jolof Empire and the kingdom of Portugal. At this time, Jolof was at the height of its power, and the Bur had extended his authority over the Malinke states on the northern bank of the Gambia, including Nyumi, Badibu, Nyani, and Wuli. In the 1480s, Prince Bemoi was ruling the empire in the name of his brother Bur Birao. Tempted by the Portuguese trade, he moved the seat of government to the coast to take advantage of the new economic opportunities. Other princes, opposed to this policy, deposed and murdered the bur in 1489. Prince Bemoi escaped and sought refuge with the Portuguese, who took him to Lisbon. There he exchanged gifts with King John II and was baptized. Faced with the opportunity to put a Christian ally on the throne, John II sent an expeditionary force under a Portuguese commander to put the prince back on the throne of Jolof. The objective was to put Bemoi on the throne and a fort at the mouth of the Senegal River. Neither goal was achieved. A dispute between the commander and the prince resulted in the former accusing Bemoi of treachery and killing him. Late period Despite internal feuds, the Jolof Empire remained a force to be reckoned with within the region. In the early 16th century, it was capable of fielding 100,000 infantry and 10,000 cavalry. But the seeds of the empire's destruction had already been sown by the prospects of Atlantic trade. Virtually everything that had given rise to the great Jolof Empire was now tearing it apart. Coastal trade, for instance, had brought extra wealth to the empire. But the rulers of the vassal states on the coast got the lion's share of the benefits, which eventually allowed them to eclipse and undermine what little power the emperor had. There was also the matter of external forces, such as the breakup of the Mali Empire. Mali's slipping grip on its far-flung empire, thanks to the growth of the Songhai Empire, had allowed Jolof to become an empire itself. But now conflicts in the north were spreading to Jolof's northern territories. In 1513, Dengella Koli led a strong force of Fulani and Mandinka into Futa Toro, seizing it from the Jolof and setting up his dynasty. Koli was the son of an unsuccessful rebellion against the Songhai Empire and may have decided to act against the Jolof as an alternative to fighting the Songhai or Mandinka. Battle of Danki and Disintegration In 1549, Kayor successfully broke from the Jolof Empire under the leadership of the crown prince Amari Ngoone Sobel Fall. The breakaway state of Cayor used its direct access to European trade (Jolof was landlocked and had no port) to grow in wealth and power. Kayor invaded its southern neighbor, Bawol, and began forming a personal union of its own. It defeated its overlord at the Battle of Danki in 1549. The battle caused a ripple effect resulting in other states leaving the empire. By 1600, the Jolof Empire was effectively over. Jolof was reduced to a kingdom; nevertheless, the title of Burba remained associated with imperial prestige and commanded nominal respect from its ancient vassals.

The 2011 Census recorded the parish's population as 614. Toponym In the 11th century the toponym was Draintone or Draitone. This is derived from Old English and means \\"farm where sledges are used\\". It is a common English toponym for places that were on a hillside, where a sledge rather than a cart was needed for heavy loads. By the 13th century it had become Draitone Passele, referring to the Passelewe family, who tenanted the manor of Drayton from the latter part of the 11th century. It evolved through Draygtone Passelewe in the 14th century and Draighton Perselow in the 17th century before reaching its current form. Manor In the reign of Edward the Confessor in the 11th century, Lewin de Nuneham held a manor of two hides and one virgate at Drayton. After the Norman conquest of England Lewin was displaced as feudal overlord by the Norman Geoffrey de Montbray, Bishop of Coutances. De Montbray tried unsuccessfully to displace the Passelewes as his tenants, and the family retained Drayton until 1379 when it passed by marriage to the Purcell family. In 1461 it was conveyed to a descendant of the Passelewes, William Laycon, in whose family it then remained until at least 1570. In Edward the Confessor's reign, two brothers held a second, smaller manor of three virgates at Drayton. The Domesday Book records that by 1086 William I's half-brother Odo, Bishop of Bayeux held the fief of this manor. However, Odo was tried for fraud in 1076 and disgraced again in 1082 for acting without Royal authority, and his extensive estates were eventually escheated to the Crown. Odo's Drayton manor was annexed to the Honour of Ampthill in Bedfordshire. In 1562 it was linked with the manor of East Greenwich, and the last record of overlordship of this manor is dated 1607. Church and chapels Base and broken shaft of Medieval preaching cross in Holy Trinity churchyard =Church of England= Holy Trinity south The Church of England parish church of the Holy Trinity contains fragments of 12th-century masonry. The first known documentary record of the parish church is from 1232. The chancel was rebuilt in the 14th century in the Decorated Gothic style. In the 15th century the nave was rebuilt and the west tower was built or rebuilt in the Perpendicular Gothic style. Of the same period are the Perpendicular Gothic hexagonal baptismal font, the three-light east window of the chancel, a 15th-century alabaster relief above the altar depicting the Crucifixion of Jesus and fragments of 15th-century stained glass in the windows. In the 16th century the south porch was added. In 1863 the church was restored and the chancel was extended about eastwards, re-using the Perpendicular east window in the new position. Holy Trinity is now a Grade II* listed building. By 1925 Holy Trinity had a ring of three bells. Bartholomew Atton of Buckingham cast the tenor bell in 1591. John Taylor & Co of Loughborough, who at the time also had a foundry at Oxford, cast the treble and second bell in 1842. In 1935 these became the fourth and fifth bells as John Taylor & Co cast a new treble, second and third bells, increasing the ring to six. Holy Trinity has also a Sanctus bell that was cast in 1669 by Anthony Chandler, who worked at his family's bell-foundry in the village (see below). Holy Trinity parish is now part of the Benefice of Newton Longville, Mursley, Swanbourne, Little Horwood and Drayton Parslow. Drayton Rectory is a Georgian house of five bays built in 1753 or 1754. Holy Trinity Church has been Grade II* listed (Entry Number: 1289256) since 19 August 1959. The summary states: \\"Fragments of C12 masonry, C14 chancel, C15 nave and W. tower,C16 S. porch. All much restored C19\\". Former Primitive Methodist chapel, now a private house =Baptist= Drayton Baptist Chapel was built in 1830. Worship at the chapel is now on alternate Sunday mornings. =Methodist= Drayton's first Primitive Methodist chapel was built in 1847. In 1912 it was replaced with a new Gothic Revival red brick chapel, and in 1932 it became part of the Methodist Union. Drayton's Methodist congregation declined in the 1960s and 70s, and in 1984 the chapel was sold and converted into a private house. History The settlement is recorded in the Domesday Book (1086) which indicates a population of 16 persons. In later years, the top end of the village became known as Hog End and later, Church End. Until the 1800s, most residents worked in agriculture.https://draytonparslow.org.uk/, Dayton Parslow =Bell-foundry= Drayton Parslow had a bell-foundry from 1635 to 1754. It was started by Richard I Chandler and run by members of his family for the next 91 years. In 1726 Edward Hall took over, and continued the business until 1754. By early 1800, the business was no longer in operation, probably because of increasing competition.http://www.mkheritage.co.uk/mkha/mkha/projects/jt/tw/docs/114.html, The Drayton Parslow Bell Foundry Reports indicate that 163 bells that were cast by founders from Drayton Parslow are known to survive. Examples in Buckinghamshire include bells at St James, Aston Abbotts, St Nicholas, Ickford and St Giles, Pitchcott and the Sanctus bell at St John the Evangelist, Whitchurch. There are also examples in Oxfordshire including at The Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Beckley, St Michael's, Fringford, St Mary the Virgin, Kidlington and SS Peter and Paul, Steeple Aston and the Sanctus bells at St Mary, Chesterton and St Nicholas', Emmington. An example in Northamptonshire is at St James the Less, Sulgrave. =World War I and II= Residents of the village were involved in both world wars.https://draytonparslow.org.uk/a-brief-history/, A Brief History The village has a memorial obelisk that states: Commemoration First World War (1914-1918), Second World War (1939-1945) at the junction of Main Road and Chapel Lane.https://www.iwm.org.uk/memorials/item/memorial/7962, Drayton Parslow According to Historic England, the village was also a World War II outstation to the Government Code and Cipher School at Bletchley Park; some of the work was moved here in 1943 when the group needed more space. Another source indicates that the buildings were also used as a prisoner of war camp, and after the war, as a hostel for displaced persons and those employed at the brick works.

It used to be part of the Mali Empire before the borders were created to separate Mali from Senegal. Tambacounda is physically the largest of Senegal's 14 regions, but is sparsely populated and its economy lags behind the rest of the country. The department of K√©dougou was separated from Tambacounda in 2008, and became a separate region. Departments Tambacounda region is divided into 4 departments: *Bakel D√©partement *Goudiry D√©partement *Koumpentoum D√©partement *Tambacounda D√©partement Geography Tambacounda is traversed by the northwesterly line of equal latitude and longitude. Culture Tambacounda is famous for its rich djembe and dance culture and heritage. Some of the greatest djembe masters from Segu, Mali came to Tambacounda in the mid 1900s, bringing with them their history, knowledge, and secrets of the djembe. Its official language is French, but Wolof is more widely spoken in S√©n√©gal. Much knowledge of djembe history was transmitted directly to djembe master Abdoulaye Diakite by his master teacher Suncaru Jara. Suncaru Jara's teacher was Chebleni Traore, whose teacher was Numuni Traore, the first djembe master to bring the djembe out of Bamana secrecy, thus igniting the diaspora of the djembe. The diaspora of the djembe also took place because there were too many djembe masters in Tambacounda at that time, pressuring some to move on to different towns or countries. Abdoulaye Diakite significantly influenced the diaspora of the djembe, first by touring worldwide with the National Ballet of Senegal for 18 years as their lead soloist, in addition to his later work in the 1990s running the Tambacounda West African Drum and Dance Camp. In light of its rich cultural heritage and location, Tambacounda is today known as djembe \\"proving ground\\", since one never knows who might be passing through town. This has had the effect of keeping the local djembe players on their toes, by playing exactly as tradition dictates. Even in the face of globalization, the djembe playing has remained remarkably traditional in Tambacounda. Economy The economy of Tambacounda is based primarily on agriculture, with cash crops including cotton and peanuts. Mining plays a role in the southern part of the region around the city of Kedougou. The region is also home to the Niokolo-Koba National Park, the largest reserve in western Africa, which supports another leg of Tambacounda's economy, tourism.

The text says \\"Death to German invaders!\\" Lev Mikhaylovich Dovator ( 19 December 1941Alexander Werth, Russia at War (1964), Carroll & Graf, page 254.) was a famous Soviet Jewish major-general who was killed in action during World War II and posthumously awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. Life Born in 1903, Dovator came from a Belarusian Jewish peasant family. In 1922, he was elected to be Secretary of Komsomol Committee of Khotino village. He joined the Red Army in 1924 and went on to become an officer after graduating from cavalry school and a military academy. In 1926 he attended Borisoglebsk- Leningrad Cavalry Commanders School, graduating in 1929 to become a platoon commander in the 27th Cavalry regiment, 5th Cavalry Division. In October 1933, he was posted with the 1st Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division, as a commissar. From May 1935 to May 1936, Colonel Dovator was commissar of the Independent Reconnaissance Battalion of the 93rd Rifle Division. He attended Frunze Military Academy in 1939, and during the early months of the war, Dovator was with the Western Front Headquarters. (Harrel, 2019) At the outbreak of the Second World War he was a Colonel in charge of a brigade of Cossack cavalry.Soviet Calendar 1917-1947: December Operation Barbarossa At the start of the German invasion of the Soviet Union, he was posted as Chief of Staff of the Red Army's 36th Cavalry Division. In July 1941, he won the Order of the Red Banner for bravery in the defense battles of at the Solovyo crossing of the Dnepr. Colonel Dovator conducted a successful fighting withdrawal, heroically crossing bridge over Dnepr River just before the Germans captured it. In August 1941 he was given command of cavalry group consisting of 50th and 53rd Cavalry Divisions. General Lev Dovator's 50th and 53rd Cavalry divisions were raised exclusively from Kuban Cossacks. Despite his Jewish heritage, unique with the Cossacks, they accepted Dovator as one of their own and considered him a great leader, superb horseman, and master of sabre. (Harrel.2019) By mid-August, German troops reached the Mezha River. On August 13, Dovator received orders to raid the German rear and disrupt preparations for their next advance. Out of his two divisions of 4,500 men he took only 3,000 Cossacks. The group was concentrated in the vicinity of Pozhano, Formino, and Budnits. By mid-August, the cavalry group was assembled in swampy and forested region 20km/12miiles east of Zharkovskii, well behind and beyond the 30th Army's right flank. For a week, Dovator's Cossacks repeatedly probed the German defenses, seeking to infiltrate. The Cavalry Group pressed its advance into the German rear in a dispersed formation, traveling along cart roads and forest trails. (Harrel. 2019) Thanks to the excellent reconnaissance cavalry 10 days saturated the troops smashed the German rear. During this time they killed more than 2,500 troops of the Wehrmacht, 200 vehicles, and 7 tanks. There were also the famous artists of the Moscow circus from the team of Mikhail Tuganov who served bravely in his unit. They were able to shoot standing on the back of a galloping horse or, on the contrary, the firing, diving under the belly of a horse, which also influenced the development among Germans of the myth of the wild Russian. The formation created an illusion that the riding force is much larger than 3,000 sabres, which had a great psychological effect on the Germans. The squadrons unexpectedly materialized from dense forests to cut communication wires, attack supply convoys and isolate German garrisons, only to vanish back into the forests. Once liberated, the villagers reported that they had heard from the Germans that 100,000 Cossacks had broken through the Geran lines. Dovator' deception was obviously working. (Harrel.2019) He soon became the commander of a cavalry group, and in August-September 1941 this cavalry group executed the most daring raid through the rear areas of the German army in the area of Smolensk. Dovator's famous raid in early 1941 was conducted with only 3000 sabres and sixty-five machine guns carried on packhorses. (Harrel, 2019) The Germans after the raid appointed the award in 100 thousand marks for his head. On 11 September 1941, he was promoted to Major General for this action.Soviet Calendar 1917-1947 (CCCP production) Battle of Moscow On November 20th, his unit become the 3rd Cavalry Corp in the short time due to its enormous success in battlefield on 27th of November it was renamed 2nd Guards Cavalry Corp. During the Battle of Moscow, Dovator was the commander of 2nd Guards Cavalry Corps, which fended off the enemy advance at Volokolamsk. He was killed in an offensive action on 19 December 1941, near the outskirts of Ruza. He was reportedly cut down by machine-gun fire while crawling towards a forward position to get a better look near the village of Palashkino. Dovator was posthumously given the title Hero of the Soviet Union two days afterwards, as well as the Order of Lenin. He was replaced in command by Major General Issa Pliyev. Lev Dovator is buried alongside Ivan Panfilov, as they heroically fought together to stop the German 9th Army from reaching Moscow.

Kadett I (1936‚Äì1940) The first Opel car to carry the Kadett name was presented to the public in December 1936 by Opel's Commercial-Technical director, Heinrich Nordhoff, who would in later decades become known for his leadership role in building up the Volkswagen company. The new Kadett followed the innovative Opel Olympia in adopting a chassis-less unibody construction, suggesting that like the Vauxhall 10 introduced in 1937 by Opel's English sister-company, the Opel Kadett was designed for high volume low cost production.

The body resembled that of the existing larger Opel Olympia and its silhouette reflected the \\"streamlining\\" tendencies of the time. The 1,074cc side-valve engine came from the 1935 Opel P4 and came with the same listed maximum power output of at 3,400 rpm.Oswald 1920 - 45 (vol 2), pp 325 & 326 The brakes were now controlled using a hydraulic mechanism. The suspension featured synchronous springing, a suspension configuration already seen on the manufacturer's larger models and based on the Dubonnet system for which General Motors in France had purchased the license. The General Motors version, which had been further developed by Opel's North American parent, was intended to provide a soft ride, but there was some criticism that handling and road-holding were compromised, especially when the system was applied to small light-weight cars such as the Kadett.Oswald 1920 - 45 (vol 2), pp 320 & 326 By the end of 1937 33,402 of these first generation Kadetts had been produced.Oswald 1920 - 45 (vol 2), p 325 =Kadett \\"KJ38\\" and \\"K38 Spezial\\" (1938‚Äì1940)= From December 1937 a modified front grill signalled an upgrade. However, the 1,074cc Opel engine and the wheelbase were unchanged, and it would have taken a keen eyed observer to spot the difference between the cars for 1937 and those for 1938.Oswald 1920 - 45 (vol 2), pp 328-329 The manufacturer now offered two versions of the Kadett, designated the \\"Kadett KJ38 and the \\"Kadett K38\\" the latter also being sold as the \\"Kadett Spezial\\". Mechanically and in terms of published performance there was little to differentiate the two, but the \\"Spezial\\" had a chrome stripe below the window line, and extra external body trim in other areas such as on the front grill. The interior of the \\"Spezial\\" was also better equipped. To the extent that the 300 Mark saving for buyers of the car reflected reduced production costs, the major difference was that the more basic \\"KJ38\\" lost the synchromous springing with which the car had been launched, and which continued to be fitted on the \\"Spezial\\". The base car instead reverted to traditional rigid axle based suspension similar to that fitted on the old Opel P4. The base car was available only as a two-door \\"Limousine\\" (sedan/saloon). Customers looking for a soft-top \\"Cabrio- limousine\\" would need to specify a \\"Kadett Spezial\\". For the first time Kadett buyers, provided they were prepared to choose a \\"Kadett Spezial\\" could also specify a four-door \\"Limousine\\" (sedan/saloon) bodied car, priced at 2,350 Marks as against 2,150 Marks for a \\"Spezial Cabrio-Limousine\\" and 2,100 Marks for a two-door \\"Spezial Limousine\\". In marketing terms the \\"Kadett KJ38\\" was intended to fill the niche that Opel had recently vacated with the departure of the Opel P4, but the KJ38, priced at 1,800 Marks, was more expensive than the P4 and its reduced specification left it with the image of a car for poor people (..Image des Arme-Leute-Autos..) at a time when economic growth in Germany was finally fostering a less minimalist approach to car buying. The \\"Kadett K38 Spezial\\" fared better in the market place: in 1938 and again in 1939 it was Germany's top selling small car. By May 1941 the company had produced 17,871 \\"Kadett KJ38\\"s and 56,335 \\"Kadett K38 Spezial\\"s. =Commercial= Competitive pricing led to commercial success, and Kadetts continued to be produced during the early months of the war: by the time production ended in May 1940, following intensification of World War II, 106,608 of these Opel KadettsOswald 1920 - 45 (vol 2), pp 287 & 325: Oswald's book (2001 edition) gives the figure of 106,608 in his table of production statistics but 107,608 in his text. had come off the assembly line at Opel's R√ºsselsheim plant, which had been the first major car plant in Germany to apply the assembly-line production techniques pioneered by Henry Ford. =Soviet afterlife= After the Second World War the Soviet Union requested the tooling from the Opel R√ºsselsheim car plant in the American occupation zone as part of the war reparations agreed by the victorious powers, to compensate for the loss of the production lines for the domestic KIM-10-52 in the siege of Moscow. Faced with a wide range of German \\"small litrage\\" models to choose from, Soviet planners wanted a car which closely followed the general type of the KIM ‚Äì a 4-door sedan with all-metal body and 4-stroke engine. They therefore rejected both the rear-engined, two-door KdF-Wagen (future VW Beetle) and the two-stroke powered, front-wheel-drive, wooden- bodied DKW F8, built by the Auto Union Chemnitz plant in the Soviet occupation zone. The closest analog of the KIM to be found was the 4-door Kadett K38. archived by WayBackMachine web archive, currently available for paid access on the original site On 26 August 1945, the State Defense Committee published Order No. 9905, which prescribed the start of production of the 4-door Kadett on the Moscow small car plant \\"without any changes to the design\\". But implementation of the plan was far from smooth. The R√ºsselsheim plant had been deeply involved in the Nazi war effort, producing aircraft engines for the Luftwaffe, and consequently has been heavily damaged by the Allied air raids. Very little was left to be salvaged ‚Äì mostly incoherent drawings and plans, with several stamping dies for the 2-door version of the Kadett to add. Still, a number of Kadetts had been captured as trophies by the Red Army and were available for study and reverse-engineering. This project was conducted by design bureaus formed as Soviet-German joint ventures under the Soviet Military Administration in Germany (SMAD). There were 11 of them in total. One in Berlin reverse-engineered the engine and transmission. Another in Schwarzenberg worked on the steel body. The wooden-bodied station wagon was developed in Chemnitz. The vast majority of the personnel of these design bureaus were German specialists and craftsmen hired by the Military Administration. These design bureaus not only prepared the necessary blueprints and documentation, but also provided the wooden master model for the body. They even developed the new trim pieces which distinguished the Moskvitch from its Opel prototype, including hood emblems and hubcaps with a large \\"M\\" (for \\"Moskvitch\\"). However, the stamping dies and most of the tooling had to be produced in the USSR. Production started on 4 December 1946. The Moskvitch 400/420 continued to be made in Moscow with some minor changes until 1956, when it was replaced by the Moskvitch 402. The latter was an all- new design apart from the engine, for which Moskvitch continued to use the Kadett side-valve engine until 1958, when it was replaced with a domestically designed OHV engine. Kadett A (1962‚Äì1965) The Kadett was reintroduced in 1962, with deliveries beginning on 2 October, a little more than 22 years after the original model was discontinued in May 1940.Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3), p 197 The new car (designated the Kadett A) was a small family car like its predecessor, although it was now available in 2-door saloon, 3-door estate (\\"Car-A-Van\\") and coup√© versions.

The cars were designed as three- or five-door hatchbacks and estates or station wagons. There were also two- and four-door sedans featuring separate boots/trunks, which shared the silhouettes of the hatchbacks: in the United Kingdom, the sedan versions were soon withdrawn, until the 1986 launch of the MKII-based Belmont. For the first time since 1965 there was no coup√©-bodied Kadett in the range: the previous Kadett C coup√© was indirectly replaced by the three-door 1.3 SR sports model. Technologically, the Kadett D was a departure, as it was Opel and Vauxhall's first front-wheel-drive car. It was also the first application of the Family II engine design, with a single overhead camshaft, aluminium-alloy cylinder head, hydraulic valve lifters, with capacities of 1297 cc (producing 60 PS and 75 PS) and had a transaxle design that allowed the clutch to be replaced without removing the transmission unit. A carry-over 1196 cc Opel OHV engine from previous generations of the Kadett producing 53 hp and a top speed of 87 mph was also offered on entry level models from launch,Daily Express Guide to 1980 World Cars, page 52 and a new 1600 cc engine was offered after Frankfurt 1981, followed by an 1800 cc version introduced for the Kadett GSE/Astra GTE model. The Kadett D was also equipped with a 1600 cc diesel engine, an option which was first presented at the Brussels Motor Show in 1982. Another frugal model, mostly sold in Italy, was the 1.0 liter model with . This range of engines was also used for later models of the Corsa/Nova, and the mid-sized Cavalier/Ascona. From May 1981, the 1.3 was also available with a three-speed automatic. The automatic was made available to the diesel in September 1982. In the United Kingdom, Opels and Vauxhalls were initially sold through separate marketing operations, with overlapping lineups that competed directly with each other. By 1982 this anomaly had been sorted out and the Opel lineup was limited to the well-equipped five-door Berlina (1.3S or 1.6S) and the sporty 1.6 SR, leaving most of the market to the Vauxhall-badged cars. One interesting version which first appeared in mid-1982 was the Kadett Pirsch, (for deer stalking, a stealthy form of hunting). In non-German-speaking countries it was generally marketed as the \\"Kadett Off Road.\\" This was a station wagon with rustic trim, fitted with a limited-slip differential, reinforced suspension and more suitable tires, increased ground clearance, a skid plate, and shortened front fenders. In Sweden, a special postal Kadett (\\"Opel Kadett Post\\") was offered, fitted with a high roof (necessitating a unique and much taller windshield) and a sliding right-hand door, RHD, and the automatic transmission. This version was converted by Karosseriefabrik Voll in W√ºrzburg, Germany. Voll also made a postal version of the later Kadett E. The Kadett D was also sold as the IDA Kadett in Kikinda, Yugoslavia. =South Africa= The Opel Kadett D was also built in South Africa by General Motors South African (Pty) Ltd. The South African range was made up of four-door fastback sedans, five-door hatchbacks, and a five-door estate model called the Voyage. The engines used are Opel's 1.2 litre overhead valve inline-four (L models only), or the OHC 1.3 litre (GL, GLS, and Voyage). Power is and respectively. Later a 1.6 litre was added and also a 1.8 in the GTE performance model. Kadett E (1984‚Äì1995) The Kadett E (Vauxhall Astra Mark 2 in the United Kingdom) was introduced in August 1984, and was voted the 1985 European Car of the Year. The 1984 model was also developed into a more conventional three-box design with a boot (trunk), badged as the Vauxhall Belmont in the United Kingdom, launched at Frankfurt 1985. This was awarded the 1985 Semperit Irish Car of the Year in Ireland. There was a station wagon called the \\"Caravan\\", available with either three or five doors. In South Africa, the Kadett notchback was sold as the Opel Monza, along with a convertible. This replaced the Opel Ascona. A convertible version was also available, for the first time in 1987, built by Bertone of Torino, Italy, bringing it to line with competitors, such as the Ford Escort and Volkswagen Golf. For the 1988 model, capacities were raised from 1.3 to 1.4 litres. In the fall of 1986 a new 1,998 cc engine replaced the 1.8 hitherto used on the GSi and Vauxhall Astra GTE in many markets, although the 1.8 continued to be sold in some places. In 1988, a 16-valve twin-cam version was developed for a high-performance GSi/GTE model, yielding in non-catalyzed form, six less horsepower with a catalytic converter fitted. While criticized for a lack of refinement, the GSi 16V was also lauded as the most powerful car available in its class at the time. Aside from the \\"16V\\" badging, it could be told from an eight-valve GSi by its twin rectangular exhaust pipes. The Kadett E has been seen as a grey import in the United Kingdom, but it is quite rare compared to its badge engineered sister, the Vauxhall Astra Mk II. It was never officially sold in Britain, and by 1989, General Motors was only marketing the Vauxhall brand in the United Kingdom, although Astras assembled at Vauxhall's Ellesmere Port plant were exported to the rest of Europe badged as Opel Kadetts. There was also a van version with a raised roof, called the Opel Kadett Combo.

(1989‚Äì1995) =Other markets= In Brazil, the Kadett E succeeded the Chevrolet Chevette and was introduced as the Chevrolet Kadett, with the station wagon version called the Chevrolet Ipanema. The latter had three doors until model year 1993, when five doors became mandatory. The hatchback was only available with three doors, and the sedan was never offered. Brazilian production of the hatchback commenced in April 1989, with the Ipanema being added in October. From 1995 all versions featured fuel injection. Brazilian cars received either 1.8 or 2.0-litre petrol or ethanol fours. The Ipanema was discontinued in 1996, and the Kadett, in 1998. While the Ipanema clearly succeeded the Maraj√≥, production of the Chevette (by now in sedan form only, the hatchback having been discontinued after the 1987 model year) and of the Kadett noticeably overlapped; the newer model was placed above the old one in Chevrolet's lineup. While Chevrolet entertained the possibility of a pick-up version of the Kadett E, it never materialized. In the early 1990s, South African Kadett GSi's were further upgraded based on their success in production car racing and initially 500 special units were built as road cars for homologation purposes. This was a minimum requirement for entry into the Stannic Group N races. They went against BMW's 325iS (A 2.7 litre homologation special from BMW). They featured more aggressive 276-degree camshafts made by Schrick with 2 different settings for timing overlap (110¬∞ and 107¬∞), revised intake and exhaust modifications (4-in-1 branch manifold and freeflow exhaust), Irmscher spring kit, modified engine management system by Promotec, a limited slip differential developed by Andre Verwey and special Aluett 7Jx15-inch ET35 alloy wheels, they were nicknamed the \\"Superboss\\" and held the world record for the most torque per litre (114 Nm per litre) for a naturally aspirated car until 2009 being beaten by the Ferrari 458 (117 Nm per litre). After the first 500 units were produced, many more were built to satisfy public demand. The Kadett E formed the basis of the Daewoo LeMans (later known as the Daewoo Cielo, Racer and Nexia) in South Korea, Nexia being the hatchback version), which was sold in the United States and New Zealand as the Pontiac LeMans, and in Canada (initially) as the Passport Optima. LeMans sales ended in 1993. The Nexia is still being produced at UzDaewoo plant in Asaka, Uzbekistan. The Cielo was last being produced at Automobile Craiova, a semi-independent (from GM) plant in Craiova, Romania. Their license expired in the fall of 2006. Kadett name In 1991, GM Europe decided to standardise model names across its two brands, and Opel adopted Vauxhall's name for the Kadett, Astra, for the replacement car for Europe which debuted that year. Only South Africa kept the Kadett name until the 1999 (Astra/Kadett F), whereafter all models took the Astra name. However, under Opel's internal naming convention, successive generations of the Astra platform are treated as a logical continuation of the Kadett lineage, hence the original 1991 Astra was designated Astra F in relation to the previous Kadett E. This convention has continued through the Astra K.

History According to A Dictionary of British Place Names, the Dunton name is Old English in origin, and means an estate linked to a man called 'Dodda' or 'Dudda'. In the 1086 Domesday Book Dunton it is recorded as \\"Dodintone.\\"Mills, Anthony David (2003); A Dictionary of British Place Names, Oxford University Press, revised edition (2011), p. 166\\\\. In the 1870s, John Marius Wilson described Dunton as: \\"a parish in Winslow district, Bucks; near the source of the river Thame, 4 miles SE by S of Winslow town and r. station.\\" Dunton's parish church is dedicated to St Martin. The church nave dates to the 12th century, the chancel to the 13th, and the tower to the 15th. Rebuilding and restoration took place in the 18th century. St Martin's was Grade II* listed by English Heritage in 1959. The church is the only public building in Dunton, and is a centre for parish social life. Further parish Grade II listed buildings include The Old Rectory, an early 18th-century house; and Dunton Manor, a 16th-century house with later alterations.

They are designed to disrupt, delay and generally slow down an attacking enemy. During the time that the attackers are slowed by the wire obstacle (or possibly deliberately channelled into killing zones, or both) they are easy to target with machinegun and artillery fire. Depending on the requirements and available resources, wire obstacles may range from a simple barbed wire fence in front of a defensive position, to elaborate patterns of fences, concertinas, \\"dragon's teeth\\" (which serve a similar purpose as wire obstacles, but for combat vehicles instead) and minefields (both anti-personnel and anti-armor) hundreds of metres thick. One example is \\"low wire entanglement\\", which consists of irregularly placed stakes that have been driven into the ground with only some 15 cm (six inches) showing. The barbed wire is then wrapped and tightened on to these. An enemy combatant running through the barrier, which is difficult to see, is apt to trip and get caught.  History  Wire obstacles were used by Union General Ambrose Burnside during the American Civil War Battle of Fort Sanders in the Knoxville Campaign, when telegraph wire was strung between tree stumps 30 to 80 yards in front of one part of the Union line. Similarly the Danish army used wire fences in front of its Dybb√∏l fortifications during the Second Schleswig War. They first saw significant military use during the Second Boer War, and reached the pinnacle of visibility during World War I where they indirectly, together with machine guns, were responsible for many (although not the majority of) casualties in the trench warfare that dominated that conflict. Wire obstacles served to magnify the substantial advantage that the repeating rifle and rapid-firing artillery, along with machine guns, had given to the defending side in the new era of warfare. World War I entanglements could in some places be scores of metres thick and several metres deep, with the entire space filled with a random, tangled mass of barbed wire. Entanglements were often not created deliberately, but by pushing together the mess of wire formed when conventional barbed wire fences had been damaged by artillery shells. Whenever there was time and opportunity to plan and emplace wire obstacles during the First World War, it was standard practice to deploy designs that would channel and concentrate attacking troops, through avenues of approach, herding them like cattle into designated killing zones i.e. fixing multiple screw pickets of wire running diagonally, away from the protected zone. This meant that a belt-fed machine-gun such as the Maschinengewehr 08 sited along that diagonal line had easy targets to enfilade when attacking troops were blocked from advancing by the wire and then massed together in a line. Another method was to deliberately leave attractive- looking gaps in wire obstacles to give the appearance of a weak link in the defences. Such gaps were designed to act like a funnel, luring attacking troops through the opening and straight into the concentrated direct and enfilade fire of different machine gun emplacements. Because multiple water- cooled machine-guns such as the Vickers gun were used, continuous fire could be sustained for hours at a time if required. Methods for soldiers to face this threat were a small wheeled steel plate that was slowly pushed forward in front of the soldier to shield them from bullet fire as they crawled, shielded machine gun carts, the MacAdam Shield Shovel or systems like the mobile personnel shield among others. When the obstacle was reached, access holes in the shield allowed the attacking soldier to cut away at the wire obstacle with pliers from behind the protection of the armored shield.\\"It Nipped Its Way Through Wire Entanglements\\", Popular Science monthly, January 1919, page 30, scanned by Google Books: https://books.google.com/books?id=HykDAAAAMBAJ&pg;=PA30 Stormtrooper platoons included ballistic shields in their equipment list, as infiltration was one of their specialities. Relatively elaborate obstacles were also used in some phases of the Korean War, and continue to be used on the Korean Demilitarized Zone, and a few other borders. However the more fluid nature of modern war means that most obstacles used today are relatively simple, temporary barriers. Tanks and light armored vehicles can generally flatten unmined wire obstacles, although the wire can become entangled in the tracks and immobilize the vehicle. This can also occur to wheeled vehicles once the wire becomes wrapped around the axle. Wire obstacles can also be breached by intense artillery shelling or Bangalore torpedoes. Enhanced effectiveness The effectiveness of any wire obstacle is greatly increased by planting anti-tank and blast antipersonnel mines in and around it. Additionally, connecting bounding anti-personnel mines (e.g. the PROM-1) to the obstacle with tripwires has the effect of booby-trapping the obstacle itself, hindering attempts to clear it. Dummy tripwires can be added to cause further confusion. If anti- personnel mines are unavailable, it is very easy to connect hand-grenades to the wire using trip-wires. If the use of lethal explosive devices is deemed to be unsuitable, it is easy to emplace tripflares in and around the wire obstacle in order to make night-time infiltration harder.

Her parents separated when she was young; but according to Tanuja, Kajol was not affected by the split as \\"we never argued in front of [her]\\". In the absence of her mother, Kajol was looked after by her maternal grandmother, who \\"never let me feel that my mother was away and working\\". According to Kajol, her mother inculcated a sense of independence in her at a very young age. Growing up between two separate cultures, she inherited her \\"Maharashtrian pragmatism\\" from her mother and her \\"Bengali temperament\\" from her father. Kajol was educated at a boarding school named, St. Joseph's Convent School, Panchgani. Apart from her studies, she participated in extra- curricular activities, such as dancing. It was in school that she began to form an active interest in reading fiction, as it helped her \\"through the bad moments\\" in her life. At the age of sixteen, she began work on Rahul Rawail's film Bekhudi, which according to her was a \\"big dose of luck\\". She initially intended to return to school after shooting for the film during her summer vacations. However, she eventually dropped out of school to pursue a full-time career in film.

The film eventually emerged as the second-highest-grossing film of the year in India.

In 2005, The Times of India ranked the movie amongst the \\"25 Must See Bollywood Films\\", citing it as a \\"trendsetter of sorts\\". In that same year's retrospective review by Rediff.com, Raja Sen stated that Kajol was \\"wisely picked ... to play Simran, the real-as-life actress bringing warmth and credulity to the initially prudish and reluctant Simran. Not to mention the on-screen chemistry that has become the stuff of legend.\\" In 1996, Kajol starred in Vikram Bhatt's action drama Bambai Ka Babu, opposite Saif Ali Khan and Atul Agnihotri. Upon release, the film emerged as a major critical and commercial disaster. =1997‚Äì1998: Widespread success= In 1997, her portrayal of Isha Diwan, a psychopath serial killer and obsessive lover, in Gupt: The Hidden Truth, was lauded by critics and proved to be a major turning point in her career. She explained that playing Diwan was the \\"toughest role\\" of her career as it was \\"difficult to play a mean character\\". In an interview with The Hindu, director Rajiv Rai quoted, \\"[I] tapped the versatile artistry in Kajol in Gupt! [She] had a complex role and she certainly brought a rare finesse to her etching of that character in the film\\". The suspense thriller, which co-starred Bobby Deol and Manisha Koirala, also emerged as a major commercial success. Kajol eventually became the first actress to be nominated for and win the Filmfare Award for Best Performance in a Negative Role. Following a leading role opposite Aditya Pancholi and Saif Ali Khan in Sanjay Gupta's box office flop, the reincarnation romance Hameshaa, Kajol starred as an aspiring nun in Rajiv Menon's Tamil film‚Äîthe romantic drama Minsaara Kanavu‚Äîopposite Arvind Swamy and Prabhu Deva. Since she doesn't speak Tamil, her voice in the film was dubbed by the Tamil actress Revathi. Kajol revealed that she found dancing alongside Prabhu Deva difficult and it \\"took me 20 retakes and 30 rehearsals\\" to get the steps right. Her performance met with appreciation with The Indian Express reviewing, \\"Kajol is full of beans and fits into her character with commendable ease. Hers is perhaps one of the most expressive faces of the present.\\" Her next release was Indra Kumar's romantic comedy Ishq alongside Aamir Khan, Juhi Chawla and Ajay Devgn, in which she played Kajal, a poor girl in love with a rich boy, played by Devgn. Upon release, the film emerged as a major commercial success, with critical praise directed to the performances of the four leads.

Directed by Tanuja Chandra and written by Mahesh Bhatt, the film revolves around Naina avenging the rape and murder of her sister, and won Kajol critical appreciation with reviewer Sukanya Verma writing: \\"Kajol is in superb form, both as the opinionated career-minded twin who is murdered, and as the avenger. Even she must have preferred less glycerine and more restraint.\\" Despite underperforming at the box office, Dushman proved to be a major critical success. For her performance, Kajol won her first Screen Award for Best Actress and received a Best Actress nomination at Filmfare. She next starred opposite Ajay Devgn in Anees Bazmee's romantic comedy Pyaar To Hona Hi Tha, a remake of the 1995 American film French Kiss.

The film emerged as a hit, and fetched Kajol a second Best Actress nomination at Filmfare that year. Khalid Mohamed referred to her as \\"the show's super-saving grace. Bubbly and spontaneous as ever, hers is a perfectly balanced performance, rescuing even the loudest scenesfrom going over the top.\\" However, her biggest success that year was her final release, Karan Johar's directorial debut, the romance Kuch Kuch Hota Hai. Co-starring Shah Rukh Khan, her cousin Rani Mukerji and Salman Khan, the film emerged as an all-time blockbuster in both India and overseas with a worldwide gross of . Kajol played Anjali Sharma, an unattractive fun-loving tomboy, who later transforms into a feminine and beautiful girl, and is secretly in love with her best friend, played by Shah Rukh Khan. Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India wrote, \\"Kajol is almost mesmeric as Anjali, the firebrand youngster who doesn't know whether she should settle for the best girl or basketball buddy ... Kajol with her baggy apparel, her bouncy bob cut, and her boyish banter is absolutely riveting.\\" In a five-star review, Khalid Mohamed of Bombay Talkies asserted that the film \\"belongs to Kajol. She pumps life into her role, giving it so much depth, daring and delicacy that she takes your breath away. In a word, she's brilliant.\\" She eventually won her second Best Actress award at the 44th Filmfare Awards ceremony and first Zee Cine Award for Best Actress for her performance in the film. Filmfare included Kajol's work in both Dushman and Kuch Kuch Hota Hai in their listing of Indian cinema's \\"80 Most Iconic performances\\". =1999‚Äì2001: Career setback and Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...= In 1999, after her marriage with Ajay Devgn, Kajol featured in a supporting role alongside him and Mahima Chaudhry in Prakash Jha's drama Dil Kya Kare. She played Nandita Rai, the other women in the life of Anant Kishore, played by Devgn. In an interview with Filmfare, she explained, \\"The only reason, I agreed to play my character was because it had shades of grey. I would have probably refused the wife's role. Because I felt it had nothing for me to do.\\" Upon release, the film met with largely negative reviews. Critic Sharmila Taliculam, however, described Kajol as \\"the only person who gives her role a semblance of sanity\\" and Deccan Herald noted her for having played \\"the passive lover with finesse.\\" Commercially too, the film failed to do well. However, her next release, Satish Kaushik's woman's film, the drama Hum Aapke Dil Mein Rehte Hain, emerged as a critical and commercial success. Starring alongside Anil Kapoor, Kajol received another Best Actress nomination at the Filmfare ceremony for her portrayal of Megha, the deceived wife of Kapoor's character.

Taran Adarsh labelled her as \\"first-rate\\" and predicted that her \\"Punjabi dialect will win her immense praise\\". The Hindu wrote, \\"Kajol ... steals the thunder from under very high noses indeed. With her precise timing and subtle lingering expression, she is a delight all the way.\\" Following the success of Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham..., Kajol took a sabbatical from full-time acting. In an interview with The Times of India she revealed, \\"I'm not quitting films, I'm just being selective. Fortunately, I'm in a position where I can pick and choose.\\" She added that the reason behind the break was to concentrate on her marriage and \\"start a family\\". = 2006‚Äì2010: Commercial fluctuations = Kajol returned to films in 2006 with Kunal Kohli's romantic thriller Fanaa, opposite Aamir Khan.

She next starred in her husband's directorial debut, U Me Aur Hum (2008) as Piya, a woman suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Devgn described Kajol's participation in the project by saying, \\"She is always thorough with the nitty-gritty of her character before she begins shooting. Since the screenplay work happened at home, Kajol was present for all the sittings and even gave her inputs.\\" Although the film was unsuccessful at the box office, she received positive reviews for her performance. Udita Jhunjhunwala noted, \\"Kajol completely comes into her own here as an ailing woman unaware of her vulnerability and delicate situation. She is superb.\\" Raja Sen added, \\"[Kajol] can span through happy-breezy with her eyes closed, and so the first half doesn't even pose her a challenge, but when Alzheimer's strikes Piya and she begins to forget all that matters in her life, Kajol raises the bar strikingly high.\\" The following year, Kajol received another Best Actress nomination at the Filmfare Awards ceremony. Kajol was next cast opposite Shah Rukh Khan in Karan Johar's My Name Is Khan, a counter-terrorism drama based on the ethnic profiling and discrimination faced by American Muslims after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

Kajol's portrayal of Mandira, a divorced, Hindu single mother who marries a Muslim autistic man, was praised by critics; Rajeev Masand observing: \\"Bringing emotional depth to what is essentially Rizwan's story, Kajol is immensely likeable as Mandira, using her eyes to convey volumes, topping the performance off with a powerful breakdown scene that literally puts her through the wringer.\\" Kajol won her fifth Best Actress award at the Filmfare for the film, thereby sharing the record for the most Best Actress wins with her late aunt, Nutan. She next starred alongside Kareena Kapoor and Arjun Rampal in Siddharth Malhotra's moderately successful family drama We Are Family, an official adaptation of the 1998 American drama Stepmom. Kajol played Maya, a character originally played by Susan Sarandon, and which she described as \\"a control freak\\", believing it \\"is something which every woman would identify with.\\" While reviewing the film for Hindustan Times, critic Mayank Shekhar stated, \\"The premise is stuff dry tissues are made for. Yet, the pathos here is produced not from moments, but from performances alone: a stunning Kajol's in particular. She appears superior to Susan Sarandon, I suspect.\\" New York Timess Rachel Saltz wrote, \\"The always appealing Kajol knows how to play melodrama without being melodramatic, and her naturalism gives the movie a genuine emotional kick.\\" Her final release of the year was Toonpur Ka Super Hero, a live-action animated film, opposite Ajay Devgn. In an interview with The Express Tribune, Kajol mentioned that it was difficult to work on the film. She added, \\"Dubbing and shooting were equally frustrating. You had to keep so many things in mind and there were a few action sequences too where I had to do action in front of green space, so I was smiling, scowling, laughing‚Äîall in the wrong places!\\" The film was a critical and commercial failure and fetched Kajol mostly negative reviews for playing a role that provided her with \\"no scope\\" to perform. = 2015‚Äìpresent: Dilwale and beyond = Kajol with Shah Rukh Khan on the sets of Dilwale in 2015, for which she received her eleventh Best Actress nomination at Filmfare After another five-year absence from the screen, Kajol co-starred with Shah Rukh Khan for the seventh time (alongside Varun Dhawan and Kriti Sanon) in Rohit Shetty's action romantic comedy Dilwale (2015).

A suspense drama short film directed by Priyanka Banerjee depicting nine women stuck in one room. Her next project will be Renuka Shahane's drama, Tribhanga, which marks her Netflix debut. The film is currently in post-production. Off-screen work =Managerial work= In 1999, following the launch of Ajay Devgn's production company, Devgan Films (renamed as Devgn Entertainment and Software Ltd.) Kajol worked towards building a website for the company. In 2000, she launched an online portal, Cineexplore for the production company. She explained, \\"The portal takes into account every aspect of film-making. My role is that of a supervisor. I just have to overlook the proceedings. We have our hands in everything. We are making software for TV and music videos.\\" Ajay Devgn established another production company Ajay Devgn FFilms in 2009. She, however, clarified that she wasn't involved in the production aspect of the company, but participated in supervising and \\"overseeing everything\\". She was named a part-time member of Prasar Bharati in 2016. =Stage performance and television= In 1998, Kajol participated in a concert tour entitled Awesome Foursome alongside Shahrukh Khan, Juhi Chawla, and Akshay Kumar. After travelling across United Kingdom, Canada and the United States of America, Kajol refused to participate in any more world tours, as she couldn't handle \\"the stress\\". In 2008, Kajol featured as a talent judge, alongside her husband, Ajay Devgn, and mother, Tanuja, in Zee TV's family reality show, Rock-N-Roll Family. She described her experience of working in television by saying, \\"Working on television is much, much tougher than films. But television has a great connection with a live audience which is a refreshing change for us actors.\\" =Social work= Kajol with Mandira Bedi at the launch of the Women's Wellness event in 2016 Kajol has been actively involved in several philanthropic endeavours related to women and children. According to her, \\"every child deserves education\\", as \\"education is the basis of society\\". In 2008, she was awarded with the Karmaveer Puraskaar, for her contribution in the field of social service. Kajol is involved with Shiksha, an NGO that works in the field of children's education. In 2009, she launched the Shiksha 2009 campaign, to support the cause. In 2011, Kajol participated in a fashion show organised by the Cancer Patients Aid Association, to generate funds for the organisation. She is the international goodwill ambassador and patron of The Loomba Trust ‚Äî a charity organisation devoted to supporting widows and their children around the world, particularly in India. Speaking about the issue, she said: \\"It's sad to know that widows are still considered a blight in our society. There are widows who are still not marriageable. I strongly feel for them and take it as a social responsibility to eradicate the issue.\\" In 2012, Kajol was appointed as the brand ambassador of Pratham, a charity organization for children. In April, she featured in a short film about education and literacy, with the children of Hanuman Basti Primary School in Mumbai, for the organization. Personal life Kajol with her husband Ajay Devgn in 2013 Kajol began dating fellow actor, Ajay Devgan, in 1994, while filming for Gundaraj. Members of the media, however, labelled them as an \\"unlikely pair\\" due to their contrasting personalities. Devgan explained their relationship by saying, \\"We never resorted to the usual 'I Love you' routine. A proposal never happened. We grew with each other. Marriage was never discussed, but it was always imminent\\". They subsequently got married on 24 February 1999 in a traditional Maharashtrian style ceremony at the Devgan house. The wedding was subject to wide media scrutiny, as certain members of the media criticised Kajol's decision to settle down at the \\"peak of her career\\". Kajol, however, maintained that she would not quit films, but would cut down on the amount of work that she did. Following her marriage, Kajol moved in with Devgan and his parents at the latter's ancestral house in Juhu. While media members speculated about a lack of compatibility between her in-laws and her, Kajol clarified that they were \\"like parents to me\\" and encouraged her to continue working in films. Tabloids have often romantically linked Devgn with other Bollywood actresses, and have reported about an imminent divorce. Refuting the rumors, Kajol stated, \\"I don't believe in those rumors because I know the way this industry functions ... You cannot continue a marriage without basic trust. Frankly, I don't care for such talk.\\" In 2001, Kajol was pregnant with her first child. However, due to an ectopic pregnancy, she suffered from a miscarriage. On 20 April 2003, Kajol gave birth to a daughter, Nysa. Seven years later, on 13 September 2010, she gave birth to a son, Yug. She described motherhood as \\"fab\\" and added that her kids brought out \\"the best in her\\". In the media Kajol at the Vogue Beauty Awards in 2012 Film critic Sukanya Verma has described Kajol as a \\"contrasting personality\\". She wrote, \\"Think Kajol, think emotions. Either she is the firebrand or the emotional sensitive types. And sometimes she is pure, wicked fun.\\" Initially termed by journalists as \\"an impulsive and impetuous brat\\", Kajol has defied the stereotypical image of a Hindi film heroine in several ways. Journalist Kaveree Bamzai elaborated, \\"She hardly looks into the mirror, barely even glances at the set monitor, usually the crutch of every insecure actor, puts on make-up only under extreme duress, and ... never watches her old movies.\\" Kajol has often been criticised in the media for \\"her lack of interest in maintaining her appearance by means of slimming, grooming, jewellery or fashion\\". Filmfare labelled her as an \\"unconventional beauty\\" and added, \\"Not one to abide by the trending norms, Kajol set her own rules in the '90s, a time when individuality didn't work for most heroines.\\" After portraying leading roles in a series of family dramas, Kajol showed versatility as an actress with Gupt, and was subsequently noted in the media for her unconventional approach in selecting projects. Her acting style has been described as being \\"natural\\". According to The Hindu, \\"What Kajol abounds in is talent and a felicity for expression. Kajol does not act out her scenes and deliver her lines; she inhabits her characters.\\" Furthermore, unlike most of her contemporaries, Kajol has had a successful career post-marriage and motherhood. Certain members of the media, however, attribute her success to her friendship with Karan Johar, Aditya Chopra and Shahrukh Khan, who \\"still find central roles for her in their movies\\". Kajol featured in Box Office India's \\"Top Actresses\\" list for five consecutive years (1995‚Äì99). In 2001 and 2006, following the commercial success of Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... and Fanaa, respectively, Kajol featured in Rediff's annual \\"Top Bollywood Actresses\\" listing. In 2007, Kajol occupied the ninth spot in Rediff's listing of the \\"Best Bollywood Actresses Ever\\". In 2011, the Government of India honoured her with the Padma Shri for her contribution to Indian cinema. In 2006, Kajol was one of the four Bollywood actors, alongside Priyanka Chopra, Hrithik Roshan and Shahrukh Khan, whose miniature dolls were launched in the United Kingdom, under the name of \\"Bollywood Legends\\". In 2010, Kajol and her My Name is Khan co-star, Shahrukh Khan, became the first Indian actors to be invited by NASDAQ to open the American stock exchange. In 2012, Kajol was placed at the fourth position by NDTV in the listing of \\"The most popular actresses of all time\\", behind actresses Madhuri Dixit, Sridevi and Meena Kumari. The same year, she was featured by Yahoo.com as one of the ten most iconic beauties of Hindi cinema. Accolades Kajol has received six Filmfare Awards, including five Best Actress awards for Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995), Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998), Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001), Fanaa (2006) and My Name Is Khan (2010), and a Best Villain award (also known as Filmfare Award for Best Performance In a Negative Role) for Gupt: The Hidden Truth (1997).

It is about south-west of Winslow. The village name 'Claydon' is Anglo Saxon in origin, and derives from the + dun meaning 'clay hill'. The affix 'East' is used to differentiate the village from nearby Steeple Claydon and Middle Claydon, and from the hamlet of Botolph Claydon that lies within the parish of East Claydon. The parish church dedicated to St Mary was demolished during the English Civil War by Cornelius Holland, one of King Charles's judges, but was rebuilt after the restoration. The current structure is largely of 18th century design, but comprises components from various centuries, the earliest of which is the 13th century. East Claydon School is a mixed, community, nursery, infant and junior school, which takes children from the age of three through to the age of 11, when they generally move to a school in Waddesdon or Winslow. The school is quite small, with approximately seventy pupils.

Author: C, Smith Edgcott is a village and a civil parish in Aylesbury Vale district in Buckinghamshire, England. It is in the Aylesbury Vale, about eight miles east of Bicester. The village name is derived from the Old English for \\"oak cottage\\". In the Domesday Book of 1086 it is recorded as Achecote, \\"√¶cen\\" (from which the word \\"acorn\\" is derived) being the Old English word for oak. The manor of Edgcott was once owned by the physician and poet Sir Samuel Garth. The village also has HM Prison Grendon located nearby. In 1807 Edgcott was described as: > The property is divided among a few. The living is a rectory in the diocese > of Oxford. The church is old but good. There is an Independent chapel.  Population  The parish had a population of 256 people according to the 2011 censuscentreEdgcott's population during the 1830s had a very small pool of job occupations, with the only noticeable job being an agricultural labourer. Obviously there are employers at this time who own the land and need manpower to work it, and according to the 'A Vision of Britain through Time', there were 4.‚òÉ‚òÉ This model of industry present in Edgcott is predictable, due to the poor transport modes in that time. People couldn't travel very far to work so needed to work locally, therefore everyone who lived in Edgcott would most likely be working the land there. Graph showing the occupations of the residents of Edgcott in 1831The following graph shows the number of people in their different age brackets who reside in Edgcott. The data used is from 2001 and shows a top heavy population, with the majority of the population being aged between 30 and 59. 141 people are in this bracket, which is approximately 55% of the population. Shows the ages of people living in Edgcott as of 2001 according to Neighbourhood Statistics  St. Michael's Church  The Church dates back to the 12th century, with many rebuilding and restorations occurring through the years. Main restorations took place in 1604 and 1875. The building was added to gradually; in the 12th century the nave and chancel were built, and then in the 15th century the west steeple was constructed. The vestry was added in the 1875 restorations. St. Michael's is a listed building under the Planning Act of 1990 due to its architectural and historic features.  Parish Council  There is an active parish council in Edgcott, meeting every six weeks in the evening. Meetings are held in the village hall, with the current chairman being Peter Harper. They contribute to decisions ranging from planning permission to extend a property, to fundraising for the local community. They recently approved and carried out street light repairs in 2015 to 2016 which cost over ¬£400, illustrating their active role in the village.  HM Prison Grendon  This institution was opened in 1962 but was originally an experimental psychiatric prison, which dealt with prisoners with antisocial personality disorders. It changed to operate as a normal prison since opening, with it being able to accommodate 238 inmates in Category B security conditions, however it still offers therapeutic care to offenders. Inmates must be over 21 years of age to be eligible of residence in the prison, as well as other requirements such as committing to be drug-free and work to change their ways. The governor as of 2016 is Jamie Bennett.

A chantry was added in 1338 and the tower in 1340. The closeness of these construction dates indicates how rich Edlesborough parish was at the time.

Villagers fought the fire, which burnt for 12 hours until it was extinguished. =Furnishings= The 15th-century rood screen, pulpit with tester and timber roofs are all notable. In the 15th century six misericords were added to the choir stalls. These include carvings of a bat, a dragon and a mermaid. The misericord of the dragon also has some frog carvings for its supporters. There are some notable brasses. The church underwent two major restorations overseen by the architect Robert Jewell Withers in 1867 and 1875. In the first restoration, box pews were replaced with pine benches, a gallery was removed from the west, the rood screen was painted, and a large wall painting was added to the nave wall by the Arts and Crafts artist Daniel Bell, depicting Christ enthroned in Majesty. The 1875 restoration of the chancel was funded by a donation from Adelbert Brownlow-Cust, 3rd Earl Brownlow of Ashridge. A more modern addition is a 2-light stained glass window on the theme of the Nativity by M. E. Aldrich Rope, also in an Arts and Crafts style.

The catchment area for the river and its tributaries is listed as being . Toponomy It is sometimes called the Dorset Stour to distinguish it from other rivers of the same name in Kent, Suffolk and the Midlands. According to Brewer's Dictionary of Britain & Ireland, the name Stour rhymes with hour and derives from Old English meaning violent, fierce or the fierce one. Course The source of the river is fed from greensand springs at Stourhead, in Wiltshire, where it forms a series of artificial lakes which are part of the Stourhead estate owned by the National Trust. It flows south into Dorset through the Blackmore Vale and the towns of Gillingham and Sturminster Newton. At Marnhull the Stour is joined by the River Cale and then (two miles downstream) by the River Lydden. At Blandford Forum the river breaks through the chalk ridge of the Dorset Downs, and from there flows south east into the heathlands of south east Dorset. At Wimborne Minster it is joined by the River Allen, and at its estuary at Christchurch it is joined by the River Avon before it flows through the harbour into the English Channel. From source to estuary, the river falls approximately over its length. For many miles the river is followed by the route of the now disused Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway, which bridged the river four times in a section between Sturminster Newton and Blandford Forum. Because much of the river's course is across clay soil, the river's waterlevel varies greatly. In summer, low water level makes the river a diverse and important habitat, supporting many rare plants. In winter, the river often floods, and is therefore bordered by wide and fertile flood plains. A number of towns and villages in Dorset are named after the river, including East Stour, West Stour, Stourpaine, Stourton Caundle, Stour Row, Stour Provost, Sturminster Newton, and Sturminster Marshall. Sturminster Newton is famous for its water mill and town bridge, which still bears the notice warning potential vandals that damaging the bridge is punishable by penal transportation. Ecology The river flows through a myriad of differing settings and scenery (reed bed, open water, coastal, estuarine, river, streams, lowland heath) and as such is host to species such as the pipistrelle bat, harbour porpoise, great crested newt, medicinal leech, Desmoulin's whorl snail and the starlet sea anemone. There are many fish that live and use the river, which include; barbel, bream, chub, dace, grayling, perch, pike, roach, rudd, salmon, tench & trout. The harbour at Christchurch has also been used to land oysters, crab, lobster and cuttlefish, all of which were fished from the harbour itself. Bass and mullet are known to use the estuary for feeding and as a nursery. Downstream of Blandford Forum, the Stour is host to an insect known as the Blandford Fly (simulium posticatum) which is known for leaving painful bites on humans. Attempts have been made to rid the fly from the area with a special spray used on the larval habitats of the fly. Recreation and amenity The harbour at Christchurch and the lower reaches of the Stour and the River Avon (Hampshire) are host to a multitude of marinas, boat clubs and landing stages. The River Stour is navigable as far upstream as Tuckton (where the tidal limit exists) and whilst there is a low bridge at Iford, it is possible to navigate as far as the rapids which are upstream of the Iford Bridge. Spring tides have been known to penetrate a further upstream as far as Blackwater Bridge (the A338 road). Boats can be hired from several yards and landings in the harbour and estuary area with kayaking and canoeing being popular on the river too. The Stour Valley Way is a designated long distance footpath that follows almost all of the course of the river. Literary associations Thomas Hardy wrote about Overlooking the River Stour,D.

Descent of the manor The Domesday Book of 1086 lists the manor as Eitone, one of the numerous holdings throughout England of Odo, Bishop of Bayeux and Earl of Kent, uterine brother of King William the Conqueror. It later escheated to the crown. In 1205 the manor of Eaton (with many othersmost notably Aston Cantlow in Warwickshire, granted in 1204 (Sanders, pp.39-40, note 9)) was granted to William I de Cantilupe (d.1239), steward of the household to King John (1199‚Äì1216),Charter Rolls, vol.1, p.147; Annales Monastici, vol.3, p.66, as quoted in whereupon it became the caput of the feudal barony of Eaton.

Early life Princesses Olga, Elisabeth and Marina of Greece as children. Princess Olga was born in Athens, Greece, on 11 June 1903. Her father was Prince Nicholas of Greece and Denmark, the third son of George I of Greece. Her mother was Grand Duchess Elena Vladimirovna of Russia, a granddaughter of Tsar Alexander II of Russia. The family of Prince Nicholas was forced into exile when Olga was eleven, following the overthrow of the Greek monarchy, and later moved to Paris, whereas Olga stayed throughout Europe with her extended family, many of whom were far from rich. Marriage and children Princess Olga and Prince Paul on their wedding day, 1923. Brought up without wealth, Princess Olga was engaged to Prince Frederick of Denmark in 1922. However, the marriage did not take place and she married Prince Paul of Yugoslavia in Belgrade on 22 October 1923. Prince Paul and Princess Olga had issue: *Prince Alexander of Yugoslavia (13 August 1924 ‚Äì 12 May 2016) married Princess Maria Pia of Savoy, daughter of Umberto II of Italy, on 12 February 1955 in Estoril Portugal.

On 9 October 1934, after the assassination of King Alexander I of Yugoslavia, Prince Paul was appointed regent of Yugoslavia until his cousin, Crown Prince Peter, attained his majority in September 1941.Neil R. Balfour, Obituary: Princess Paul of Yugoslavia in The Independent dated 3 November 1997 During the Second World War, on 25 March 1941, on behalf of the government led by Cvetkoviƒá, Prince Paul signed the Tripartite Pact, which took Yugoslavia into the Axis with Germany and Italy, although without any commitment to fight and with guarantees of freedom of action. Two days later, leaders of the Yugoslav air force launched a sudden coup d'√©tat against the government and Regent, declaring King Peter to be of age.Mateos Sainz de Medrano (2004), p. 260 Paul, Olga, and their three children were arrested and given as prisoners to the British, who deported them to Greece, where they were guests of King George II, and then on to Egypt. Meanwhile, the change of government in Yugoslavia led Hitler to bomb Belgrade and then to invade the country in April 1941. From house arrest in Cairo, Paul and his family were moved to Kenya, where they arrived on 28 April 1941. There they were guests of Lord Erroll at Osserian, but remained under surveillance. In August 1942, the accidental death of Prince George, Duke of Kent, left his widow, Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark, inconsolable, and the British government was persuaded to allow Olga to join her sister in England. Once there, she pleaded her husband's case unsuccessfully. Returning to Kenya in January 1943, she found Paul severely depressed. In June the British allowed the family to settle in South Africa, where several members of the Greek royal family were. In South Africa they were no longer treated as prisoners, but they were not formally released until June 1946, a year after the end of the war, and they were not allowed to return to Europe until 1948. Later life In 1948, Paul, Olga, and their three children were finally able to travel to Europe. Yugoslavia having fallen to the communists in 1945, they could not go home, and settled first in Switzerland and then in Paris, with frequent visits to London and Florence, where Paul owned a house, the Villa di Pratolino. In Tuscany, Olga was again able to see something of her cousin and friend Helen of Romania, and in Britain was always made welcome by Marina, Duchess of Kent, and the rest of the British royal family. In 1954, Olga's son Nicholas was killed in a road accident, and then in 1957 her mother died in Athens. Widowed in 1976, Olga took to living in Britain. Her sister Marina having died in 1968, she stayed at Kensington Palace with Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester, and then later at Clarence House, in the household of HM the Queen Mother. She gained the reputation of being a demanding guest.Ricardo Mateos Sainz de Medrano, La Familia de la Reina Sof√≠a : La Dinast√≠a griega, la Casa de Hannover y los reales primos de Europa, Madrid, La Esfera de los Libros (2004, , OCLC 55595158), pp. 261‚Äì262 With old age, Olga's health suffered, but she continued to attend great occasions, such as the marriages of Alexander, Crown Prince of Yugoslavia in 1972, Prince Michael of Kent in 1978, and Charles, Prince of Wales and Lady Diana Spencer in 1981. In 1972 she stood with Prince Alexander at the altar, as his mother and grandmother were not well enough to attend.Mateos Sainz de Medrano (2004), pp. 262, 412, 456 Final years and death Suffering at the end of her life from Alzheimer's disease, Olga spent several years in a hospital at Meudon, in the suburbs of Paris. In 1993, her daughter Princess Elizabeth set out to make a film-documentary about her with the help of a Serbian journalist. However, by then Olga was suffering from dementia, and her daughter's plan created a scandal. Her son Prince Alexander brought an action in the French courts against his sister, claiming $107,000 in damages and interest.Mateos Sainz de Medrano (2004), pp. 262‚Äì263 Princess Olga eventually died in Paris on 16 October 1997 and was buried beside her husband and her son Nicholas at the Bois-de-Vaux Cemetery, Lausanne, Switzerland.Mateos Sainz de Medrano (2004), p. 262 On 28 September 2012, after the rehabilitation of Prince Paul by a new Serbian government, the remains of Olga, her husband, and their son Nicholas were exhumedMarie Parvex, ¬´Elisabeth de Yougoslavie exhume ses parents enterr√©s √† Lausanne¬ª, in Le Temps dated 28 septembre 2012 and taken to Belgrade, for a ceremony in St Michael's Cathedral.

Some of the plan's psychological warfare and use of paramilitary actions were carried out, but the planned open war failed to occur because of the Munich Agreement. Background First drafted in late 1937, the plan was then revised as the military situation and requirements changed. The last revision of the plan scheduled the attack for 28 September 1938. However, as France and the United Kingdom were reluctant to go to war for the sake of Czechoslovakia and both expressed political will to appease Germany, the execution of the plan was postponed. After the Munich Conference produced the Munich Agreement on 30 September 1938, the plan was abandoned altogether. In ceding the border areas to Germany, Poland and Hungary, Czechoslovakia lost the majority of its border fortifications and became less defensible against any invading force. On 13 March 1939, Adolf Hitler and Joachim von Ribbentrop informed Jozef Tiso about the irreversible decision to occupy Bohemia and Moravia in the coming hours, while Slovakia was to decide on its fate itself. After the proclamation of the Slovak Republic shortly after the end of Nazi ultimatum, Hitler invited the Czech president Emil H√°cha declaring that the German army was about to invade the Czech lands and the resistance would be suppressed by Nazis by all means. On 15 March, Germany occupied the remaining Czech part(, ) and established the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. The name was later assigned to the plans for an invasion of Ireland. Psychological warfare The plans of had a large role for psychological warfare, both within Czechoslovakia and against Czechoslovakia's allies. Internally, the Czechoslovak government and citizenship were supposed to be intimidated and have their will to defend themselves broken, and the ethnic German minority (which was largely pro-German and pro-Nazi), was supposed to internally weaken and disrupt the country. Internationally, co-ordinated Nazi psychological and propaganda warfare aimed at making the country isolated to the point that it would stand alone against any aggression, with defence having no hope. Modern media, especially radio, played key role in the Nazi psychological warfare. Within Czechoslovakia, Nazi Germany also relied on using the Sudeten German Party as well as its paramilitary organization the Freiwilliger Schutzdienst. Undeclared German-Czechoslovak war On 17 September 1938, Adolf Hitler ordered the establishment of , a paramilitary organisation that took over the structure of , an organisation of ethnic Germans in Czechoslovakia that had been dissolved by the Czechoslovak authorities the previous day because of its implication in large number of terrorist activities. The organisation was sheltered, trained and equipped by German authorities and conducted cross-border terrorist operations into Czechoslovakian territory. Relying on the Convention for the Definition of Aggression, Czechoslovak President Edvard Bene≈°President Bene≈°'s declaration made on 16 December 1941 and the Czechoslovak government-in-exileNote of the Czechoslovak government-in-exile dated 22 February 1944 later regarded 17 September 1938 to be the beginning of the undeclared German-Czechoslovak war.

Directed by William Dieterle and produced by Pandro S. Berman, the film is based on Victor Hugo's 1831 novel. Plot =Prologue= \\"With the end of the 15th century, the Middle Ages came to a close. Europe began to see great changes. France, ravaged by a hundred years of war, at last found peace. The people under Louis XI felt free to hope again ~ to dream of progress. But superstition and prejudice often stood in the way, seeking to crush the adventurous spirit of man.\\" =Summary= In Paris during the late Middle Ages, Louis XI, the King of France, and his Chief Justice of Paris, Jehan Frollo, visit a printing shop. Frollo is determined to do everything in his power to protect Paris from anything he sees as evil, including the printing press and gypsies, who at the time are persecuted and prohibited from entering Paris without a permit. That day is Paris' annual celebration, the Feast of Fools. Pierre Gringoire, a poor street poet, does a play in front of an audience until it is interrupted by Clopin, the King of the Beggars. Esmeralda, a young gypsy girl, is seen dancing in front of an audience of people. Quasimodo, the hunchback and bell ringer of Notre Dame Cathedral, is crowned the King of Fools until Frollo catches up to him and takes him back to the church. While trying to find Louis to speak to him, Esmeralda is caught by a guard for entering Paris without a permit and is being chased after by a couple of soldiers until she seeks safety in Notre Dame, in which the Archbishop of Paris, Frollo's brother Claude, protects her. She prays to the Virgin Mary to help her fellow gypsies only to be confronted by Frollo, who accuses her of being a heathen. Afterwards, she asks Louis to help her people, to which he agrees. Frollo then takes her up to the bell tower where they encounter Quasimodo, of whom she is frightened. As she runs away from the hunchback, Frollo commands Quasimodo to chase after her and kidnap her. Quasimodo catches up to Esmeralda and physically carries her away. Gringoire witnesses all this, and calls out to Captain Phoebus and his guards, who capture Quasimodo just in time. Esmeralda is then saved and starts falling in love with Phoebus. Gringoire later accidentally trespasses the Court of Miracles, and is about to be hanged by the beggars under Clopin's orders until Esmeralda saves him by marrying him. Afterwards, Frollo orders the guards to arrest and round up the gypsy girls to make an inspection in an attempt to find Esmeralda, but realizes that she is not present in the group and releases them. The next day, Quasimodo is sentenced to be lashed in the square and publicly humiliated afterwards. He then asks the Parisian townspeople for water. Frollo, seeing this, realizes that he can't stop the sentence in time because it already happened, and abandons Quasimodo instead of helping him. However, Esmeralda arrives and gives Quasimodo water, and this awakens the hunchback's love for her. Later that night, Esmeralda is invited by the nobles to their party. Frollo shows up to the party, where he confesses to Esmeralda his lust for her in a hiding place. Afterwards, she dances with a black goat named Aristotle in front of the nobles and moves away from the crowd with Phoebus to a garden where they share a moment between each other. Frollo then kills Phoebus out of jealousy, and Esmeralda is wrongly accused of his death. Gringoire visits her in the prison cell to console her and tells her that he will help her to get her free. Frollo arrives at Notre Dame where he confesses the crime to his brother, and, knowing that the Archbishop refuses to help him because he is the murderer, intends to sentence Esmeralda to death for it (which he does), saying that she has \\"bewitched\\" him. Gringoire tries to get Esmeralda free by writing an appeal, but fails when the printing press gets destroyed by soldiers under Frollo's orders. He also tries to claim Esmeralda's innocence in the courtroom, but fails again when Frollo orders his soldiers to take him away. Quasimodo also shows up to the courtroom to save Esmeralda by saying that he committed the crime, but also fails by being mocked by the Parisians and dragged away by the soldiers. After Esmeralda is forced under torture to confess to the crime she did not commit, Louis shows up to the courtroom and attempts to help Esmeralda by offering her a trial by ordeal, in which she is blindfolded and must reach out to choose one of two daggers placed on the table before her: her own dagger (which will indicate her guilt if chosen) or Louis's dagger (which will demonstrate her innocence). When Esmeralda chose her dagger, the judgement is against her and Frollo sentences her to be hanged in the gallows. As Esmeralda is being taken in front of Notre Dame to do public penance, the Archbishop claims her innocence and does not allow her to do penance; however, Frollo still orders Esmeralda to be hanged in the gallows. Just as she is about to be hanged, though, Quasimodo saves her by taking her to the cathedral. When Gringoire and Clopin realize that the nobles are planning to revoke Notre Dame's right of sanctuary, they both try different methods in order to save Esmeralda from hanging. Gringoire writes a pamphlet that will prevent this from happening, and Clopin leads the beggars to storm the cathedral. At the Palace of Justice, Frollo reads the pamphlet to Louis. After seeing a crowd protesting against the removal of Notre Dame's sanctuary law, Louis realizes that the pamphlet is creating public opinion, which can influence kings to make decisions. However, Frollo warns and advises him against public opinion, saying that it is dangerous. After the Archbishop arrives to inform Louis of Notre Dame's attack and that Esmeralda is innocent, Louis demands to know who the real murderer is, to which Frollo confesses his crime to Louis and walks away, leaving Louis shocked. Louis orders Olivier to arrest Frollo and then talks to Gringoire after reading his pamphlet. Meanwhile, Quasimodo and the guards of Paris fight off Clopin and the beggars. Afterwards, he sees Frollo in the bell tower seeking to harm Esmeralda, and when he comes up, Frollo tries to stop him. Frollo then attempts to kill Quasimodo with a dagger, but Quasimodo, realizing Frollo's evil nature, stops him and in defense for himself and Esmeralda he throws Frollo off the cathedral top, sending him down to his death. Later that morning, Esmeralda is pardoned by the King and freed from hanging due to the success of Gringoire's pamphlet. Her Gypsy people are also finally freed. Then, she comes to truly love Gringoire and leaves with him and a huge cheering crowd out of the public square. Quasimodo sees all this from high on the cathedral and says sadly to a gargoyle, \\"Why was I not made of stone, like thee?\\".

Irving Thalberg, who was an uncredited producer in the 1923 film, considered remaking the film in 1934 and even discussed the idea with Charles Laughton. Two years later, Universal regained interest in a remake, with a fan poll being instrumental in influencing the studio to make the film. Ronald Colman, Paul Muni, Fredric March, Lionel Barrymore and Peter Lorre were the choices in the poll and in the end, Universal decided to go with Lorre, even as far as negotiating with the actor to star in the film, but the project never materialized. A year later, Carl Laemmle, Jr. persuaded Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to buy the property from Universal as a star-vehicle for Muni. Metro refused and sold the rights to RKO, with Pandro S. Berman producing and William Dieterle directing. For this production, RKO Radio Pictures built on their movie ranch a massive medieval city of Paris and Notre Dame Cathedral in the San Fernando Valley. This was one of the largest and most extravagant sets ever constructed. Screenwriter Sonya Levien, who was entrusted to translate Hugo's novel into this film, made the story relevant to the events of the time the film was made: she made the obvious parallel between Paris' persecution of the gypsies and Germany's treatment of the Jews prior to World War II. =Casting= After hearing the news that RKO was going to remake the 1923 film, Lon Chaney, Jr. sought to play the role of Quasimodo and screen-tested for the studio. While the studio felt that Chaney gave excellent performances in his numerous screen tests, other actors would be more suitable for the part, Orson Welles being one of the many considered. Laughton was set to star as Quasimodo, but RKO offered Chaney the role when it seemed like the British actor would be unable to work in America due to troubles with the IRS. Laughton managed to overcome his problems and got the part. Pleased with her work on Alfred Hitchcock's Jamaica Inn, Laughton brought a then 18-year old Maureen O'Hara to Hollywood to play Esmeralda. This marked O'Hara's American screen debut. According to actress Kathryn Adams, she was supposed to play Esmeralda, but lost the role to O'Hara when Laughton cabled from Ireland to Hollywood that he was \\"bringing Esmeralda\\". Adams played a companion of Fleur as compensation for losing the role. Dieterle wanted Claude Rains to play Frollo, but before he agreed to play the part, he had an unexpected encounter with Laughton on the Universal lot in which Laughton was very condescending. Rains, who had mentored Laughton and John Gielgud at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, later remarked that their encounter at the lot was the end of their relationship and refused to play the role, which would be played by Cedric Hardwicke. =Filming= With a budget of $1.8 million, Hunchback proved to be one of the most expensive movies ever made by the studio. It was shot at the RKO Encino Ranch, with the interiors of the bell tower being shot at the Mudd Hall of Philosophy at the University of Southern California. The sets of Paris and the Notre Dame Cathedral were constructed by Van Nest Polglase at the cost of $250,000 (about $4,500,000 in 2019 dollars), while Darrell Silvera worked as set decorator. Walter Plunkett oversaw the costume design and Joseph H. August served as cinematographer, this film being the first of his three collaborations with Dieterle. Filming proved to be difficult for the cast and crew due to the hot temperatures, particularly for Laughton, who had to act with a lot of makeup. In her autobiography, O'Hara recalls one day arriving on the set and finding chimpanzees, baboons and gorillas. Dieterle wanted monks to be on the set but his assistant mistakenly thought he wanted monkeys because of his poor English and thick German accent. Makeup artist Perc Westmore was loaned by Warner Bros. to RKO for the production. Westmore and Laughton did not get along. Though Westmore wanted to use sponge rubber to make a light appliance for Laughton to wear, Laughton wanted a heavy one to help him stay in character. Laughton was offended when Westmore suggested he try acting like the hump was heavy and was rude and dismissive to Westmore throughout filming. Near the end of the shoot, Westmore called his younger brother to the studio, where he witnessed Westmore, while strapping on the hump, spray Laughton in the face with a seltzer bottle full of quinine water and then kick him in the posterior. Westmore told Laughton, \\"That's for all the grief you gave me\\" and added that his brother was a witness and would deny anything Laughton said about the incident. When Poland was invaded by Nazi Germany on September 1, most of the cast and crew was in a state of fear of what was going to happen. Laughton lightened the mood by reciting the Gettysburg Address (that he had recited in Ruggles of Red Gap). Another incident of emotional filming was the filming of the scene where Quasimodo rings the bells in the tower of the cathedral for Esmeralda. Feeling in pain because his native Britain had declared war on Germany, Laughton rang the bells over and over again until he fell down from exhaustion, overwhelming the crew with emotion. =Censorship= The characters of Claude and Jehan Frollo are changed from the novel, as was done in the 1923 film. Such changes were made because the filmmakers were concerned that portraying the priest as a villain would violate the policy of the Hays Production Code. In the novel Claude is depicted as the villainous 36-year-old Archdeacon of Notre Dame; in the film he is the good Archbishop of Paris and is older in age. His younger brother Jehan (\\"Jean\\" in the film), who in the novel is a teenaged drunken student and a juvenile delinquent, is in the film a middle-aged villain who is Paris' chief justice and a close advisor to King Louis XI. Award nominations The film was nominated for two Academy Awards: * Academy Award for Best Original Music Score (Alfred Newman) * Academy Award for Best Sound (John Aalberg) The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists: * 2002: AFI's 100 Years...100 Passions - #98 Reception The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 93% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 14 reviews, with an average rating of 8.65/10. Variety called the film a \\"super thriller-chiller\\" but found that the elaborate sets tended to overwhelm the story, particularly in the first half. Harrison's Reports wrote, \\"Very good! Audiences should be thrilled anew by this lavish remake of Victor Hugo's famous novel.\\" Film Daily called it \\"compelling, dynamic entertainment.\\" John Mosher of The New Yorker wrote that Laughton \\"achieves something like a tour de force. The lines themselves (such modernisms as 'to buy protection'), along with a perfunctory plot arrangement, are among the weak features of the film, which otherwise is a vivid pictorial drama of fifteenth-century Paris.\\" E. H. Harvey of The Harvard Crimson said that the film \\"in all is more than entertaining.\\" He said that \\"the mediocre effects offer a forceful contrast to the great moments\\" in the film. However, Frank S. Nugent of The New York Times wrote a mostly negative review of the film, finding it \\"little more\\" than \\"a freak show\\". Though he acknowledged it was \\"handsome enough of production and its cast is expert,\\" he called it \\"almost unrelievedly brutal and without the saving grace of unreality which makes Frankenstein's horrors a little comic.\\" The movie was very popular but because of its cost only made a profit of $100,000. Home video The Hunchback of Notre Dame was released on DVD in Region 1 on September 21, 2001 by Image Entertainment. It was issued on Blu-ray in Region A by Warner Home Video on June 9, 2015.

It had a population of 32,150 at the census in 2011. Toponymy The name Rayleigh is Old English in origin deriving from r«£ge ('female roe-deer or she-goat') and lƒìah ('clearing'). Therefore, the name means overall 'wood or clearing of the wild she-goats or roe-deer\\".The Cambridge Dictionary of English Place Names, ed. by Victor Watts (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004).Rayleigh Civic Society 2006 History =Prehistoric and Roman times= There has been a scattering of stray finds around the town from Prehistoric and Roman times, including some Roman roof and hypocaust tiles found within the fabric of Rayleigh Church. This suggests that there was a Roman habitation site within the area. However, there is little evidence of any density of population here during this period.Historic Town Assessment Report for Rayleigh, 1999, pages 3 and 7. =Saxon era= One significant archaeological find was in the early 2000s at the western edge of Rayleigh, at the site of the former Park School in Rawreth Lane. An early Saxon cemetery site was discovered here, with 144 cremation burials and evidence of just one high-status female inhumation burial.Essex County Council Unlocking Essex's Past. SMR Number 45134. By the end of the Saxon period, there was definitely a village here, as it is recorded in the Domesday Book, when it was held by Swein of Essex, the son of Robert FitzWimarc. The most significant historic monument in Rayleigh is the great medieval mound of Rayleigh Castle. This was an early Norman motte and bailey castle, of which only the motte and its surrounding embankments remain. Despite the loss of its timber superstructure and later stone buildings, its height and bulk mean that it still dominates the town centre. =Later medieval period (1154‚Äì1485)= A courthouse was erected in Rayleigh in 1338. This was apparently resented by the townspeople, who turned out in force to destroy it, with 20 ringleaders later arrested and tried.Burrows 1909, p.31. The forests around Rayleigh were royal hunting grounds. It is recorded that King Henry III hunted here in 1222, and three King Edwards also visited.Burrows 1909, p.27. One of the oldest secular building in Rayleigh is 91 High Street which houses Pizza Express downstairs and Rayleigh Town Museum upstairs. The Regal Room in the museum is dated circa 1350. It is suspected that some of Rayleigh's older Brick build buildings may contain portions older than this. Rayleigh Castle gradually fell into disuse, and in 1394 King Richard II gave permission for the townspeople of Rayleigh to use the foundations as a source of stone. By this time, the site was in royal ownership and used for pasture: : know all men of special grace who have the will to repair certain Chapel in the said town and to build a new a certain belfry we have granted them the foundations and to take away and use any stones found theren\\".Rayleigh Civic Society 2006, Holy Trinity Church =Tudors and Stuarts= Records indicate that the church was rich in plate, vestments and stained glass, but these were disposed of: : \\"No church within the hundred was more splendidly adorned; none were so richly furnished with plate, vestments and other accessories for the celebration of the divine service; none were so rich in painted glass; none have been more mercilessly despoiled\\"Burrows 1909, p.303.

Governance The civil parish of Rayleigh became part of Rochford Rural District in 1894. In 1929 it was combined with Rawreth to form the Urban District of Rayleigh, which was abolished in 1974 when the area became part of the District of Rochford. The constituency of Rayleigh and Wickford is represented in the House of Commons by the Member of Parliament Mark Francois of the Conservative Party.\\"Rt Hon Mark Francois MP, Parliament.uk, accessed 8 January 2018. In 2018 Rochford District Council has 25 Conservative members, 3 Liberal Democrats, 3 Green Party, 2 Labour, 4 independents and 4 members from Rochford Residents Party sitting on the council.

Rayleigh has two secondary schools: The Sweyne Park School, formed by the amalgamation of the Sweyne and Park schools, and FitzWimarc School. It also has seven primary schools ‚Äì Down Hall, Edward Francis, Grove Wood, Our Lady of Ransom (Catholic), Rayleigh Primary and Wyburns. The seventh, Glebe Primary School with UHI, was created in September 2014 through the amalgamation of Glebe Infant and Nursery School and Glebe Junior School. In addition, St Nicholas C of E Primary School, a long-established school for the adjoining village of Rawreth, moved in 2006 to a new building just on the Rayleigh side of the parish boundary.http://www.st- nicholassch.co.uk/the-history-of-our-school/ Sports and recreation Rayleigh has a golf club on the outskirts of the town; Rayleigh Club (previously Lords Golf & Country Club) is situated on Hullbridge Road to the north of the town. =Parks/playing fields= Rayleigh has a number of parks and playing fields.

The small wood is the only surviving ancient wood in Rayleigh, but it has rich and varied wildlife and a well-documented history. Wheatley Wood This is a broadleaved wood established in the late 1990s. The wood was designed and planted by a partnership of Local people and the Woodland Trust. There is a car park at the Grange Community Centre in Little Wheatley Chase, and access to the wood is across the playing fields. =Greyhounds and speedway= At least two greyhound racing tracks existed in the town. The main venue was the Rayleigh Weir Stadium which also hosted speedway and traded from 1948-1974. A smaller short lived track at O'Tooles Meadow, Wickford Road, off the Down Hall Road also hosted greyhound racing and dirt track speedway. The racing was independent (not affiliated to the sports governing body the National Greyhound Racing Club) and was known as a flapping track, which was the nickname given to independent tracks. The track opened in 1932 but the date of closure is not known and it is possible that it may have been the same venue known as the Rayleigh Sports Stadium although it is also possible that the Rayleigh Sports Stadium may have been a third separate venue. Public facilities Former Post Office in Rayleigh. Rayleigh Windmill There is a small outdoor market on Wednesdays. Until 2011 it was located next to Rayleigh Civic Suite and Information Centre, opposite Holy Trinity Church. In 2011 it moved to the taxi rank in the town's High Street (outside Boots). The market dates back to before 1181 when it was inscribed in the Exchequer Records of Henry II. The Dutch Cottage, the smallest and oldest council house in the United Kingdom, can be visited on Wednesdays by prior appointment. Rayleigh Windmill has been renovated, including a structural renovation of the 19th century brick built building has now been completed. The basic external brickwork has been repaired and the interior has been transformed to provide four storeys of modern display facilities which has turned the windmill into a major tourist and educational attraction in the county. The changes to the windmill allow the public to view the interior and to exploit this local historic amenity for cultural, educational and tourism use. Rayleigh Mount, a National Trust property adjacent to Rayleigh Windmill, is the site of a Domesday castle erected by Sweyn of Essex with distinctive motte-and-bailey defences. From its summit it offers sweeping views across the Crouch Valley. =Rayleigh Town Museum= Rayleigh Town Museum occupies the 1st floor at 91 High Street and contains many artifacts telling the history of Rayleigh. Religion Holy Trinity parish church The Church of England parish church of the Holy Trinity is at the top of the High Street. A church existed on the site in Saxon times and the present building has a Norman chancel. The bell tower was built in the 15th century and includes stone taken from the castle when that fell into disuse. The church has an impressive Tudor brick porch. The Gothic Revival architect C.C. Rolfe restored the chancel in 1873.Saint, 1970 The parish church of Saint Michael and All Angels is in Sir Walter Raleigh Drive near Sweyne School. It was built in the 1950s when Rayleigh expanded considerably.

The village is at the foot of the Chiltern Hills just to the south of the Vale of Aylesbury, two miles from Wendover and five miles from Aylesbury. It lies between Wendover and the village of Little Kimble. The civil parish (population in 2001 was 811) includes the hamlets of Butlers Cross, Chalkshire, Terrick and Dunsmore. Close to Ellesborough is the Prime Minister's country residence Chequers. History The village's name is derived from the Old English for \\"hill where asses are pastured\\". This denotes its importance to the nearby settlements known today as The Kimbles and collectively they comprise a typical Chiltern strip parish with Ellesborough containing valuable hill pasture. In the Domesday Book of 1086 it was recorded as Esenberge. The road from Wendover to Princes Risborough, which makes a very clearly defined detour around the hill on which Ellesborough Church stands, follows the route of the Icknield Way, an ancient trackway used by man in the neolithic age (3000 to 1800 BC) which ran from Norfolk to Avebury in Wiltshire. Beacon Hill Towering over the village is the dominating Beacon Hill, with its grassy mound and lone tree, iconic amongst the Chiltern Hills when viewed from within the Aylesbury Vale. It is also the site of Cymbeline's Mount, also known as Cymbeline's Castle, referred to in the Shakespeare play Cymbeline. In reality, the name refers to the British King Cunobelinus who, alongside his sons, is said to have battled at this site against the Roman Invasion of the British Isles. It is the site of a medieval motte and bailey castle. Parish church The parish church of St Peter and St Paul The Church of England parish church of Saints Peter and Paul stands apart from the village, high on the hill overlooking it. The central part of the building dates from the 15th century, with extensions and restoration between 1854 and 1871. It contains 17th century memorials to Sir Robert Croke MP, his son Robert, and their family. Prime Ministers have often attended this church for Sunday morning worship when in residence at Chequers. Tony Blair, however, followed his wife and children to their Roman Catholic church in Great Missenden. Margaret Thatcher was famously known to have prayed at Ellesborough church, finding comfort during the Falklands War. Notable people Lady Isabella Dodd, widow of Sir Samuel Dodd, endowed workhouses in the village in her will in 1722. The Dame Isabella Dodds charity continued until 2004 and gave its name to Dame Isabella Dodds Court in Aylesbury. Notable people who live in the village include former Formula One world champion racing driver Sir Jackie Stewart and the actor Sir David Jason.

Scots place name and surname Dunsmore is a surname and place name of Scottish origin, predating its first written mention in the Chartulary of the abbey of Lindores in 1198AD. [Reference: Lindores Abbey and its burgh of Newburgh: their history and annals (1876) by Alexander Laing.] The name Dunmore (Dundemor, Dunsmore) was given to a chapel of Lindores Abbey, at Abdie, at least as early as 1198 AD. [Reference: The Chartulary of the Abbey of Lindores 1195-1479]. This location is presently known as Denmuir. Dunmuir and Dunmuire also appear in historical records as variants of the name Dundemor, Dunmore or Dunsmore. However, according to Alexander Laing, F.S.A.Scot., 19th century Scots historian of Newburgh and environs, the namings Denmuir and Dunmuir are \\"erroneous.\\" [Reference: Lindores Abbey and its burgh of Newburgh: their history and annuals (1876) by Alexander Laing.] According to known historical documentation the surname Dundemor was first used by one Waldino (Waldin, Waldeve) between 1199-1202 in Medieval Scotland. [PoMS, no. 13008 (http://db.poms.ac.uk/record/person/13008/; accessed 1 January 2016]. Waldino de Dundemor is documented as witnessing the gift of Naughton to the Priory of St. Andrews. Many people were documented as using Dundemor and its variants for their surname. Adopting a place name for a surname was a practice first used on Continental Europe. This practice spread to the UK predominately after 1066 with the Norman Conquest and its Norman-French and Flemish nobility. In Scotland surnames taken from lands became more common after the Davidian Revolution. For example, there are early uses of the name by John de Dundemor and Henry de Dundemor. [Lindores Abbey and its burgh of Newburgh: their history and annuals (1876) by Alexander Laing.] Prior to Scottish unification of Picts and Gaels, circa 900 AD, it is believed that the inhabitants of Fife spoke a Brythonic Celtic language. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the origin of the word Dunsmore is Celtic, taken from Dun, meaning hill fort and More from Mori, meaning sea.Proto-Celtic ‚Äï English Variants of the names are often due to the way in which the possessive is spoken in the different languages spoken in Scotland though the centuries: in Gaelic: Dun More or Dun Mor; in French: Dundemore or Dundemor; and in English: Dunsmore or Dunsmor. Additionally, the 'u' has sometimes been spoken as 'i' in the process of anglicising the name, yielding Dinsmore. Further evidence of the origin of the name is attested to by the remains of a Fife hill fort, Dunmore, at position 56¬∞ 10' 15.65\\" N, 3¬∞ 20' 12.14\\" W which overlooks the Firth of Forth. The history of the Dun[s]more family was described in Lindores Abbey and its burgh of Newburgh: their history and annuals (1876) by Alexander Laing. Quoting from pages 433‚Äì435: Chapel of Dun[s]more \\"Dunsmuir, more correctly Dunmore, [is found] in the parish of Abdie. In the confirmation of the Foundation Charter of Lindores Abbey by Pope Innocent III., A.D. 1198, 'the chapel of Dundemore' is described 'as belonging to the church of Londors.' The name is undoubtedly derived from the Gaelic Dun more, the great dun or fort on Norman's Law,-- Glossary of Cleveland Dielect, p. xx. There is a small chapel on the property, the walls of which are nearly entire, but roofless. It is of comparatively modern creation, but the stones of a much older chapel have been used in its construction and it is a legitimate inference to presume that they formed part of the chapel existing [in] A.D. 1198. Besides hewn work built among the rubble, the lintels of the gable windows are specially noticeable. They consist each of a single stone hewn into a semicircular or arched form, almost identical with some described by Dr. Petrie, as seen in very ancient Irish churches.--Round Towers of Ireland, p. 181\\\\. The engraving of the window in the east gable of the chapel, at page 402, is from a drawing by Mr. Jervise of Brechin. It gives a most accurate representation of the original. Forfeiture of the Isle of May \\"The lands of Dunmore belonged to a family of great antiquity, who took their surname from the name of their property. Henry of Dundemore was a witness to the conveyance of the lands of Rathmuryel to the Monastery of Lundoris Abbey, in the year 1245.--Collections on Aberdeen and Banffshires, p. 626\\\\. \\"John of Dundemore was one of the Regents of Alexander III in his minority, 1249-1262.-- \\"In the year 1260, 'a controversy arose between the monks of the Isle of May and Sir John of Dundemore, relative to the lands of Turbrech, in Fife, which, after many altercations, was settled by Sir John relinquishing all claim to the lands; in consideration of which the prior and monks granted him a monk to perform divine service in the chapel of the Blessed Virgin Mary in the Isle of May, for his soul, and the souls of his forefathers and successors. They were also to pay him half a merk of silver yearly, or sixty 'mulivelli' (a kind of fish abounding in the northern seas-- the word has been translated mullet or haddock), as their option; and they also granted to him and his heirs a lamp of glass (to burn continually) in the church of Syreis, or Ceres, and for feeding it two gallons of oil, or twelve pence yearly. If they should fail to observe these conditions, Sir John was to have right of regress to the lands.'--Preface to the Records of the priory of the Isle of May, pp.xvi, xvii. \\"Henry of Dundemore, the successor of John, apparently not afraid for the loss of prayers of the monks, seized a horse belonging to them, because they would not swear fealty to him for the lands of Turbrech; but in 1285 the Bishop of St Andrews, as arbiter, decided 'that the monks were not bound to make the fealty claimed, and gave sentence that the horse be restored.'--Ib., p.xvii. The Scottish War of Independence Edward I of England invaded Scotland in 1296. On 8 August 1296, Edward I ordered the removal of the coronation-stone of the Scottish kings, the scone stone, to Westminster in England. On August 9, he arrived at Lindores, in Fife. On August 28, Edward I ordered, on pain of death, that the Scottish abbots and noblemen swear fealty to him, thus forcing their signature on the Ragman Rolls. [Reference: The Chartulary of the Abbey of Lindores 1195-1479]. Patrik de Dundemor and Henry de Dundemor are documented as del counte de Fyfe and were forced by Edward I to sign the 1296 Ragman Rolls. According to eminent historian Alexander Laing, during the Scottish Wars of Independence: \\"The Dundemores' seem to have been a family of great ability, and their talents raised them to high positions both in Church and State. In the struggle for Independence, they adhered to the patriotic side, and suffered in consequence. Among the petitions presented to Edward I for maintenance of wives of those whose estates had been seized because of their opposition to his claims, appears that of Isabella, widow of Simon of Dundemore, 3d September 1296. Her petition was endorsed with these words, Habeat quiete totum--Let her quietly have the whole. \\"Sir Richard of Dundemore was taken captive at the Battle of Dunbar in 1296, and imprisoned in Winchester Castle, where he was confined for at least two years. On the 30 September 1298, an order allowing him fourpence a day for his maintenance while in prison, is preserved among the English Public Records.--Historical Documents, Vol. II., pp. 93, 94-307. \\"Thomas of Dundemore, Bishop of Ross, recognised the title of King Robert Bruce to the Crown of Scotland, A.D.1309. In the same year, John of Dundemore affixed his seal as a witness to the settlement of the dispute between the Abbot and Convent of Lundoris and the Burgesses of Newburgh. \\"Stephen of Dundemore, who is expressly mentioned as being descended from the Dundemores of that ilk in Fife, was elected Bishop of Glasgow A.D. 1317. The Bishop-elect being a keen supporter of Bruce, Edward II wrote to the Pope not to admit him to the Bishopric; and it would appear that he never was consecrated, having died, it is said, on his way to Rome.--Keith's Scottish Bishops, pp. 187-242. \\"On the 27 June 1321, Sir John Dundemore conveyed by charter in free gift to the monks of Balmerino, the right to the water running through his land of Dunberauch for the use of their mill at Pigornoch. The bestowal of this gift was apparently made at the occasion of a festive gathering at Dunmore; The Bishop of St Andrews [Bishop William de Lamberton], the Abbot of Lundoris, Sir David de Berkeley (of Cullairnie), Sir Alexander Seton (Governor of Berwick), Alex of Claphain, and others, were present as witnesses; most of whom had borne their part in the great struggle for Independence.--The Chartulary of Balmerino, pp. 40, 41.\\" Forfeiture of Lands In addition to these forfeitures to the Church, the remaining lands of ancient Dunmores \\"seems to have come into the hands of the crown\\" in the 15th century. Emigration Many Dinsmores, Dunmores, Dunsmuirs, and Dunsmores emigrated from Fife in the seventeenth century to the Americas, and to Ulster and Donegal in Northern Ireland. Many of these Dunsmores subsequently emigrated to Canada, the United States and Australia.

History  Ollerton is a settlement listed in Domesday Book, located in the Bassetlaw Wapentake or hundred in the county of Nottinghamshire at a crossing of the River Maun. In 1086 it had a recorded population of 15 households, and is listed in the Domesday Book under 2 owners, Open Domesday by Anna Powell-Smith. Formerly a rural village with a tradition of hop-growing centred on the parish church of St Giles the settlement has its origins at a point where three main routes cross. The A614 linking Nottingham north through Sherwood Forest to Blyth, Nottinghamshire and on to the large minster town of Doncaster; the A6075 linking Mansfield with the ferry crossing of the River Trent at Dunham-on-Trent and on via the A57 road to the cathedral city of Lincoln, England; and the A616 linking Sheffield with the Great North Road Great Britain at Newark-on-Trent. From the 1920s onwards the main industry was coal mining with Ollerton expanding greatly during the 1960s and 1970s. The colliery was sunk in the 1920s and completed during the General Strike of 1926, which led to a saying of \\"Ollerton was ever built with scab labour\\". During the expansion of the pit, many miners from closed collieries in north-eastern England and Scotland moved to work at Ollerton. There was a large Polish community amongst the miners at Ollerton, estimated to make up roughly half the workforce at the time of the 1984-1985 strike. As Ollerton Colliery was considered one of the most left-wing pits in Nottinghamshire, it was subject to heavy picketing at the time of the ballot by the Nottinghamshire NUM in March 1984. A miner from Ackton Hall Colliery, near Featherstone, West Yorkshire died at Ollerton when picketing during the miners' strike on 15 April 1984.BBC, Bradford and West Yorkshire, March 2009.

Bottled water is drinking water (e.g., well water, distilled water, mineral water, or spring water) packaged in plastic or glass water bottles. Bottled water may be carbonated or not. Sizes range from small single serving bottles to large carboys for water coolers. History Although vessels to bottle and transport water were part of the earliest human civilizations, bottling water began in the United Kingdom with the first water bottling at the Holy Well in 1621. The demand for bottled water was fueled in large part by the resurgence in spa-going and water therapy among Europeans and American colonists in the 17th and 18th centuries. The first commercially distributed water in America was bottled and sold by Jackson's Spa in Boston in 1767. Early drinkers of bottled spa waters believed that the water at these mineral springs had therapeutic properties and that bathing in or drinking the water could help treat many common ailments. The popularity of bottled mineral waters quickly led to a market for imitation products. Carbonated waters developed to reproduce the natural effervescence of spring-bottled water, and in 1809 Joseph Hawkins was issued the first U.S. patent for \\"imitation\\" mineral water. Technological innovation in the 19th century led to cheaper glass and quicker bottling. So bottled water could be produced on a larger scale and grew in popularity. Many saw bottled water as safer than municipal water supplies, which could spread diseases such as cholera and typhoid. By around 1850, one of America's most popular bottlers, Saratoga Springs, was producing more than 7 million bottles of water annually. Bottled water In the United States, the popularity of bottled water declined in the early 20th century, when the advent of water chlorination reduced public concerns about water-borne diseases in municipal water supplies. But it remained popular in Europe, where it spread to caf√©s and grocery stores in the second half of the century. Perrier water had been bottled since the 19th century and widely sold throughout the British Empire; in 1977 Perrier launched in the United States. Today, bottled water is the second most popular commercial beverage in the United States, with about half the domestic consumption of other soft drinks. =Water chemistry= Many of the early developments in the field of chemistry can be attributed to the study of natural mineral waters and attempts to replicate them for commercial sale. Joseph Priestley, who discovered oxygen in 1775, made his first contributions to the field of chemistry by dissolving carbon dioxide in water, for which he was awarded the Copley Medal in 1773. He later worked with Johann Jacob Schweppe, founder of Schweppes, in developing \\"aerated\\" waters for commercial sale. =PET plastic bottles= In 1973, DuPont engineer Nathaniel Wyeth patented Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles, the first plastic bottle to withstand the pressure of carbonated liquids. Today, PET plastic has replaced glass as the preferred material for single-serving bottled water containers due to its light weight and resistance to breaking. PET Plastic Bottle Water Types Distilled, purified water, in Hong Kong Some of the more common types of bottled water are: * Artesian water ‚Äì this is water that originates from a confined aquifer that has been tapped and in which the water level stands at some height above the top of the aquifer. * Fluoridated ‚Äì this type of water contains added fluoride. This category includes water classified as \\"For Infants\\" or \\"Nursery.\\" * Groundwater ‚Äì this type of water is from an underground source that is under a pressure equal to or greater than atmospheric pressure. * Mineral water ‚Äì water from a mineral spring that contains various minerals, such as salts and sulfur compounds. It comes from a source tapped at one or more bore holes or spring, and originates from a geologically and physically protected underground water source. No minerals may be added to this water. * Purified water ‚Äì this type of water has been produced by distillation, deionization, reverse osmosis, or other suitable processes. Purified water may also be referred to as \\"demineralized water\\". * Sparkling water ‚Äì Sparkling water contains the same amount of carbon dioxide that it had at emergence from the source. The carbon dioxide may be removed and replenished after treatment. * Spring water ‚Äì this type of water comes from an underground formation from which water flows naturally to the Earth's surface. * Sterile water ‚Äì this type of water meets sterilization requirements, for example, those specified under \\"sterility tests\\" in the United States Pharmacopoeia. * Well water ‚Äì well water is taken from a hole tapping, etc. This hole may be bored, drilled, or otherwise constructed in the ground. Product Forms The Beverage Marketing Corporation defines the bottled water market segment as \\"retail PET, retail bulk, home and office delivery, vending, domestic sparkling and imports\\", but excluding \\"flavored and enhanced water.\\"\\"Smaller categories still saw growth as the U.S. liquid refreshment beverage market shrunk by 2.0% in 2008, Beverage Marketing Corporation reports\\", press release Beverage Marketing Corporation, 30 March 2009. =Purified water vending machines= A bottle-less drinking water vending machine in Pattaya, Thailand. Customers bring their containers A number of cities and companies worldwide have vending machines that dispense purified water into customer's own containers. All dispensers filter the location's tap water. In North America, these machines are typically located outside of supermarkets. =Bottled water service= It is not uncommon for business or individuals to subscribe to a bottled water service. These services deliver water either monthly or weekly, sometimes even daily. Traditionally, water in glass bottles (jugs) was provided to electric coolers in areas of businesses without plumbing. Plastic containers have replaced those glass jugs, however, dispensers at businesses now may stand alongside existing water taps or fountains. =Storage= Bottled water is often stored as part of an emergency kit in case of natural disaster. The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) says the \\"safest\\" and \\"most reliable\\" source of drinking water is store-bought bottled water. Commonly, disaster management experts recommend storing of water per person, per day for at least three days. This amount is intended to include water for drinking and cooking as well as water for hand washing, washing dishes, and personal hygiene. Factory containers of water have an indefinite shelf life, as long as they remain unopened and undamaged. The sell-by date is voluntarily and individually set by manufacturers to indicate the length of time that they believe the water will taste and smell fresh, rather than to indicate any issue of contamination or food safety. PET Recycling The most common packaging material for single-serve, non-carbonated bottled water in the United States and Europe is polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic. Marked in many countries with resin identification code number ‚Äú1,‚Äù PET is 100% recyclable, though recycling rates vary by region. In 2014, approximately 1.8 billion pounds of post-consumer PET bottles were collected in the United States and 1.75 million metric tons (approximately 3.9 billion pounds) were collected in the European Union, making it the most recycled plastic in both the United States and Europe. In the United States, the recycling rate for PET packaging was 32% in 2014; in the European Union, the recycling rate for PET packaging for the same period was approximately 52%. The National Association for PET Container Resources (NAPCOR), the trade association for the PET plastic packaging industry in the United States and Canada, identifies five major, generic end-use categories for recycled PET plastic: 1) packaging applications, including new bottles; 2) sheet and film applications, including some thermoforming applications; 3) strapping; 4) engineered resins applications; and 5) fiber applications. According to the nonprofit Recycling Across America, five individual serving PET plastic bottles provide enough fiber to make one square foot of carpet or to fill one ski jacket. In Europe, more than one-third of recovered PET plastic is used to produce polyester fibers, and another quarter is used in the production of preformed plastic containers‚Äîsuch as egg cartons, fruit boxes, and other plastic beverage bottles. Water and Energy Usage Qiemo, Xinjiang, China On average, it takes 1.32 litres (L) of water to produce 1 L of bottled water. This includes 1 L of ingredient water and 0.32 L of water used in facility processes such as treatment, bottling, and maintenance. Small pack facilities (facilities that package water in containers between 8 oz. and 2.5 gallons) use the least amount of water (1.26 L per 1 L), followed by mixed packaging facilities (1.46 L per 1 L). Facilities that package water for home and office delivery in sizes of 2.5 gallons to 5 gallons use the most water (1.56 L per 1 L). Bottled water has lower water usage than bottled soft drinks, which average 2.02 L per 1 L, as well as beer (4 L per 1 L) and wine (4.74 L per 1 L). The larger per- litre water consumption of these drinks can be attributed to additional ingredients and production processes, such as flavor mixing and carbonization for soft drinks and fermentation for beer and wine.Thomas Andrew Gustafson. How Much Water Actually Goes Into Making A Bottle Of Water?, NPR, 30 October 2013. In the United States, bottled water production represents 0.011% of annual water consumption. Critics of bottled water argue that the industry should take in to account not just water used in its production and packaging process, but the total water footprint of its supply chain, which includes water used in the production of its packaging. A 2011 IBWA lifecycle inventory study found that the production, packaging, and transportation of bottled water within the United States consumes of energy annually, which represents about 0.07% of yearly energy consumption in the country.IBWA. Life Cycle Inventory of the U.S. Bottled Water Industry, 5 January 2011. According to the same study, 6.8 million tons of CO2 eq are emitted by the bottled water industry a year in the United States, about 0.08% of annual emissions. An Aetna Group study in 2015 concluded that each litre of bottled water requires 240 kilojoules of energy to produce. The lifecycle carbon footprint for a half litre of small pack bottled water is 111 grams CO2 eq. By comparison, the same sized PET plastic-bottled soft drink produces 240 grams CO2 eq. Soft drink bottles require much thicker plastic due to carbonation, and therefore many more grams of CO2 eq. Regulation =Bureau of Indian Standards ‚Äì India= The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) is the national Standards Body of India working under the aegis of Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution, Government of India. It is established by the Bureau of Indian Standards Act, 1986 which came into effect on 23 December 1986. The Minister in charge of the Ministry or Department having administrative control of the BIS is the ex-officio President of the BIS. =Food and Drug Administration ‚Äì US= Bottled water is comprehensively regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a packaged food product. By law, the FDA regulations for bottled water must be at least as stringent as the Environmental Protection Agency standards for tap water. The FDA has established \\"Standards of Identity\\" for bottled water products sold in the U.S. For a product to be considered ‚Äúbottled water‚Äù, it cannot contain sweeteners or chemical additives (other than flavors, extracts or essences) and must be calorie-free and sugar- free. If flavors, extracts and essences‚Äîderived from spice or fruit‚Äîare added to the water, these additions must comprise less than 1% by weight of the final product. The FDA Code of Federal Regulations establishes limitations for the amount of fluoride that can be added to water. Mineral water contains at least 250 parts per million total dissolved solids (TDS). \\"Purified water\\" is defined in the United States Pharmacopoeia. =Food Standards Code ‚Äì Australia & New Zealand= Food Standards Australia New Zealand's Food Standards Code limits fluoride in bottled water to between 0.6 and 1.0 milligrams per litre, and requires any addition to be specified on the product label. =Industry reform ‚Äì Canada= The Council of Canadians, a social action organization, stressed the need for bottled water industry reform after launching a boycott of Nestl√© in September 2016 after the company outbid a small town aiming to secure a long-term water supply through a local well as the country battles drought and depletion of ground water reserves. Premier Kathleen Wynne stated that her government will look for ways to put community needs ahead of bottled water corporations, saying \\"as we look at the water bottling industry, that has to be a question because we're talking about what we could argue is our most precious resource\\" that they have this \\"discussion about our water, the status of and the treatment of water bottling companies, that needs to be taken into consideration\\". Markets =Global sales= Global bottled water consumption crossed the 3 billion hectoliter threshold in 2014. In 2017, the global rate of consumption rose by an estimated 7.6 percent. Per capita consumption was 50.1 liters, up by 3 liters from 2016's 47.1 liters.\\"The Global Bottled Water Market.\\" Beverage Marketing Corporation. February 2018. =Australia= The Australasian Bottled Water Institute is a regional member of the International Council of Bottled Water Associations. The bottled water industry in Australia is worth approximately $400 million per year, An upmarket restaurant in Sydney has stopped selling bottled water and started using a machine costing A$5000 to filter, chill and carbonate tap water to get the same quality water. Despite ongoing water restrictions, an application to extract groundwater for bottled water was approved in 2020. =European Union= Directive 2009/54/EC deals with the marketing and exploitation of natural mineral waters in the European Union. The two main types of bottled water recognized are mineral water and spring water. Broadly speaking, \\"mineral water\\" is groundwater that has emerged from the ground and flowed over rock. Treatment of mineral water is restricted to removal of unstable elements such as iron and sulfur compounds. Treatment for such minerals may extend only to filtration or decanting with oxygenation. Free carbon dioxide may be removed only by physical methods, and the regulations for introduction (or reintroduction) of CO2 are strictly defined. Disinfection of natural mineral water is completely prohibited, including the addition of any element that is likely to change bacterial colony counts. If natural mineral water is effervescent, it must be labelled accordingly, depending on the origin of the carbon dioxide: naturally carbonated natural mineral water (no introduction of CO2); natural mineral water fortified with gas from the spring (reintroduction of CO2); carbonated natural mineral water (CO2 added following strict guidelines). Directive 2001/83/EC deals with bottled water that is considered a \\"medicinal product\\" and is thus excluded from the scope of the other regulation. =India= The bottled water industry in India witnessed a boom in the late 1990s soon after Bisleri launched its packaged drinking water in the country. This significant growth was fuelled by a surge in advertising by the industry players that \\"bottled water was pure and healthy\\". The total market was valued at in 2013, of which the top five players (Bisleri, PepsiCo, Coca-Cola and Parle) accounted for 67% of the market share. This market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 22%, to reach in 2018. In 2016, Sikkim announced restrictions on the usage of plastic water bottles (in government functions and meetings) and styrofoam products as it is associated with adverse health and environment impacts. Available Sizes : 20 L (jar), 5 L (bottle), 1 L (bottles - pack of 12), 500 mL (bottles - pack of 24), 250 mL (bottles - pack of 48 or 36), 200 mL (bottles - pack of 48 or 36). =Lebanon= Lebanon has one of the fastest growth rate of per capita consumption of bottled water. Lebanon has seven major brands of bottled mineral water for local consumption and for exportation to the water-starved countries on the Arabian Peninsula and in the Persian Gulf. =New Zealand= Bottled water in New Zealand is regulated by Food Standards Australia New Zealand and must comply with the Food Act 1981. From July 2009 fluoride was allowed to be present in bottled water as an additive or as a natural occurring mineral. =Pakistan= Due to contaminated water being widespread, in the mid-1980s urban families started installing filtration units at home. This later developed into companies providing mineral water delivery services at home. Use of these bottles that could be attached to a dispenser is still widespread. Bottled water was made famous by one of the largest marketing campaigns in Pakistan history undertaken by Nestle. Eventually, other bottlers including dozens of local ones, Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Mineral Drops by water icon, Nature, Vey, Nova Pure Water Larkana, Mina Water, Great Water Islamabad, Dew Drop, and other imported brands such as Evian began marketing in the country. =United States= The U.S. is the second largest consumer market for bottled water in the world, followed by Mexico, Indonesia, and Brazil. China surpassed the United States to take the lead in 2013.\\"The U.S. Bottled Water Market Reached New Heights in 2013, BWR, Jul/Aug 2014. In 2016, bottled water outsold carbonated soft drinks (by volume) to become the number one packaged beverage in the U.S. In 2018, bottled water consumption increased to 14 billion gallons, up 5.8 percent from 2017, with the average American drinking 41.9 gallons of bottled water annually.\\"Bottled Water in the U.S. through 2022.\\" Beverage Marketing Corporation. Aug 2018 In the United States, bottled water and tap water are regulated by different federal agencies: the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates bottled water and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates the quality of tap water. The International Bottled Water Association (IBWA) is headquartered in Alexandria, VA. From 1970 (16 brands) over 1998 (50 brands) to 2012 (195 brands), the number of mineral water brands in the U.S. has grown exponentially. Consumer information =Labeling= In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates all packaged foods and beverage products, including bottled water, and mandates labeling requirements. FDA labeling requirements include a statement of the type of water in the container, compliance with the applicable definitions in the FDA Standards of Identity, ingredient labeling, name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer or distributor, net weight, and, if required, nutrition labeling. =Consumer information= Public water systems are required by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to provide households in their service territories with a Consumer Confidence Report (CCR) that provides information on the quality of their water during the previous year. Such disclosures are not required by the FDA of any packaged food or beverage product, including bottled water. All packaged foods and beverages, must be manufactured according to FDA regulations and must meet all applicable quality and safety standards. A bottled water refill station in a Canadian grocery store In Canada, bottled water must meet the standards in the Food and Drugs Act & Regulations (FDAR) as it is considered a food. The FDAR works in partnership with Health Canada and Canadian in developing the policies regarding bottled water. The CFIA focuses more on regulations pertaining to packaging, labeling, advertising, and other safety practices, whereas the FDAR focuses more on the water itself. For example, the bottled water must meet the Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) Regulations in Division 12, Part B of the Act must be met before it is approved for sale. Some of the regulations include: labeling terms, safety standards (i.e.: what is acceptable), and microbiological standards (i.e.: chlorine). In addition to this, the type of filtration method the water has gone through must be shown on the label, as stated in Section B.12.009 Additional information regarding regulations can be found on the CFIA website. The regulations specific to bottled water is in Division 12 and 15, which specify what can be added, such as the amount of arsenic and lead. Regulations are always being updated to conform with new scientific data, laws, new products, and new improvements. In terms of the types of water sold, spring and mineral water must meet the following criteria: * originate from an underground source which is not part of a community water supply; and * be naturally fit to drink (potable) at the source; and * before bottling, not be treated in any way that changes the original chemical composition of the water. (The allowable treatments are discussed in section 1.2.) In Canada, there are two categories of bottled water: 1) spring/mineral water, or 2) water other than mineral water or spring water. Emergency preparedness Emergency preparedness refers to the steps taken prior to a natural disaster or emergency to ensure safety throughout the event. The American Red Cross and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) recommend that individuals and families maintain disaster supply kits in the event that an emergency disrupts food supply or public water systems, blocks roads, or leaves people unable to find essentials. Following disasters such as floods, blizzards, or earthquakes, water sources can be cut off or contaminated, limiting access to safe, clean drinking water. For this reason, FEMA recommends that all disaster supply kits include one gallon of water per person per day for at least three days for drinking and sanitation. In hot climates, FEMA recommends doubling this quantity. For the water supply, FEMA recommends commercially bottled water kept in a cool, dark place. As an alternative, FEMA recommends using disinfected food-grade water containers to store tap water and replacing the water every six months. =Bottled water in emergency response= Hurricanes Following Hurricane Sandy, FEMA requested 5.4 million bottles of water from Nestle North America to aid in disaster relief efforts. Nestle donated 3 million bottles of water to Haiti following the 2010 earthquake. In the wake of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, FEMA requested 100 tractor trailers‚Äô worth of bottled water (approximately 200,000 cases) from the American Beverage Association. Tornadoes AmeriCares, an international disaster relief non-profit, donated 109,000 bottles of water to residents in and around Moore, Oklahoma following the May 2013 tornadoes. Members of the International Bottled Water Association donated more than 400,000 additional bottles of water to the victims of the tornadoes. Contamination In August 2014, city officials in Toledo, Ohio banned local tap water after toxins from an algae bloom in Lake Erie were found in the city's water supply. The American Red Cross and AmeriCares responded by helping coordinate the distribution of bottled water to the 500,000 area residents impacted by the ban. Concerns =Bottled water debates= Bottled water is bought for many different reasons including taste, convenience, poor tap water quality and safety concerns, health concerns and as a substitute for sugary drinks. The environmental impact, container safety, water origin, emergency supplies and role of the bottled water industry continue to be areas of concern for many people. Most bottled water containers are made from recyclable PET plastic, and some of these bottles end up in the waste stream in landfills. The financial and environmental costs of transportation of bottled water has been another concern because of the energy used and the consequent release of carbon dioxide and the potential impact on climate change. In some cases it can be shown that bottled water is actually tap water. However, it is also argued that the quality specifications for some bottled waters in some jurisdictions are more stringent than the standards for tap-water. In the US, bottled water that comes from municipal suppliers must be clearly labeled as such unless it has been sufficiently processed to be labeled as ‚Äúdistilled‚Äù or ‚Äúpurified‚Äù. One American study showed that \\"even in areas with safe tap water, African American, Polish American and Latino parents were three times more likely to give their children mostly bottled water compared to non-Latino white children, because of their belief that bottled water is safer, cleaner, better tasting, or more convenient.\\" The economic implications of this also showed serious inequities: as a percentage of household income, whites reported median spending of 0.4% of their income on bottled water; African Americans and Latinos reported median spending to be more than twice as high.‚ÄùGleick, Peter H. \\"Another Cost of Bottled Water: Environmental Injustice and Inequity.\\" The Huffington Post. The Huffington Post, 9 June 2011. Web. 20 March 2014. The study volunteers, \\"For poor families, the use of bottled water may lead to less availability of resources for other health needs.......by the rather striking levels of expenditure on water relative to household income.\\" On a global scale, markets for bottled water in poorer developing countries are growing rapidly due to increased fears of ‚Äúcontaminated tap water, inadequate municipal water systems, and increased marketing on the part of bottled water companies.‚Äù Sales of bottled water in Mexico, China, and parts of India are rising steeply. =Perceptions about bottled water= Bottled water is perceived by many as being a safer alternative to other sources of water such as tap water. Bottled water usage has increased even in countries where clean tap water is present.Ferrier, Catherine. \\"Bottled water: understanding a social phenomenon.\\" AMBIO: A Journal of the Human Environment 30.2 (2001): 118‚Äì119. This may be attributed to consumers disliking the taste of tap water or its organoleptics.Doria, M. D. \\"Bottled water versus tap water: understanding consumers-preferences.\\" J Water Health 271 (2006): 276. Another contributing factor to this shift could be the marketing success of bottled water. The success of bottled water marketing can be seen by Perrier's transformation of a bottle of water into a status symbol. However, while bottled water has grown in both consumption and sales, the industry's advertising expenses are considerably less than other beverages. According to the Beverage Marketing Corporation (BMC), in 2013, the bottled water industry spent $60.6 million on advertising. That same year, sports drinks spent $128 million, sodas spent $564 million, and beer spent $1 billion. Consumers tend to choose bottled water due to health related reasons. In communities that experience problems with their tap water, bottled water consumption is significantly higher. The International Bottled Water Association guidelines state that bottled water companies cannot compare their product to tap water in marketing operations. Consumers are also affected by memories associated with particular brands. For example, Coca-Cola took their Dasani product off the UK market after finding levels of bromate that were higher than legal standards because consumers in the UK associated this flaw with the Dasani product. \\"Bottled water sales are higher amongst African- American, Asians and Hispanic groups, which typically have lower incomes than whites.\\" Some hypothesize that these differences are due to the geographic distribution of ethnic groups. It was theorized that ethnic differences in bottled water usage \\"mirror the variability of water system quality between urban, suburban and rural areas (Abrahams et al. 2000) and it was also pointed out that they might reflect the memory of past problems caused by deficient tap-water systems in deprived areas (Olson 1999).\\" In France, a similar geographic study in the early 1970s found that bottled water consumption was found to be much higher in urban areas (Ferrier 2001). This finding was \\"also explained in terms of the poor quality of urban tap water and of the bad condition of the old lead pipes in French cities. Nonetheless, while poor tap water quality may motivate the public to search for alternative sources, it alone does not necessarily lead to higher consumption of bottled water.\\" Some surveys \\"found that bottled water, far from being an alternative to tap water, seems to be mostly consumed as a substitute for alcoholic and traditional soft drinks (e.g. AWWA-RF 1993; FWR 1996) ‚Äì the exception being when water contamination presents serious health risks and the trust in the tap water company is highly eroded (e.g. Lonnon 2004).\\" Another explanation for the rise in popularity of bottled water is alternative explanation is that \\"the consumption of 'pure' and 'natural' bottled water in degraded environments may represent a symbolic purging behavior.\\" Many low-income families avoid drinking tap water because they fear it may cause sickness.\\"Bottled, filtered, and tap water use in Latino and non-Latino children.\\" Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine 161.5 (2007): 457‚Äì461. Bottled, filtered, and tap water are all for the most part safe in the United States. The Environmental Protection Agency regulations for tap water are \\"actually stricter than the Food and Drug Administration regulations for bottled water.\\" A study of drinking water in Cincinnati, Ohio, discovered that bacterial counts in bottled water were often higher than those in tap water and fluoride concentration was inconsistent. Globally, there is an intensifying environmental backlash against bottled water usage. As global consumption of bottled water soars, environmental groups such as the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and Greenpeace have warned of the huge environmental footprint of the plastic in which the water is packaged.\\"Mail & Guardian Account Login.\\" The M&G; Online. N.p., n.d. Web. 8 April 2014. In 2001, a WWF study, \\"Bottled water: understanding a social phenomenon\\", warned that in many countries, bottled water may be no safer or healthier than tap water and it sold for up to 1,000 times the price. It said the booming market would put severe pressure on recycling plastics and could lead to landfill sites drowning in mountains of plastic bottles. Also, the study discovered that the production of bottled water uses more water than the consumer actually buys in the bottle itself. =Pricing= A street vendor selling bottled water in Istanbul, Turkey Bottled water is more expensive than municipally-supplied tap water. Tap water sources and delivery systems (taps and faucets) are fixed in place while bottled water is available at many differing price points and in a variety of size formats. \\"The consumption of bottled and filtered water has dramatically increased in the United States during the past decade, with bottled water sales tripling to about $4 billion a year. More than 50% of the US population drinks bottled water and 'people spend from 240 to over 10,000 times more per gallon for bottled water than they typically do for tap water.' An annual supply of bottled water for a person who consumes 8 glasses a day would cost approximately $200; the same amount of tap water would cost approximately $0.33. In general, women are more likely to drink bottled water than men, and Hispanic women are the group most likely to drink bottled water.\\"Hobson, Wendy L., et al. \\"Bottled, filtered, and tap water use in Latino and non-Latino children.\\" Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine 161.5 (2007): 457‚Äì461. The Beverage Marketing Corporation (BMC) states that in 2013, the average wholesale price per gallon of domestic non-sparkling bottled water was $1.21. BMC's research also shows that consumers actually tend to buy bottled water in bulk from supermarkets (25.3%) or large discount retailers (57.9%) because it costs significantly less. Convenience stores are likely to have higher prices (4.5%), as do drug stores (2.8%). The remaining 9.5% is accounted for through vending machines, cafeterias and other food service outlets, and other types of sales. =Bans= In response to environmental and financial concerns, a few localities and U.S. colleges are banning bottled water sales. In 2009, the small New South Wales town of Bundanoon voted to become the first town in the world to ban the selling or dispensing of bottled water. Bundanoon caught the attention of many other cities around the world. After a Sydney-based beverage company wanted to open a water extraction plant in the New South Wales town Bundanoon, residents outlawed the sale of bottled water. The town continues to fight the company's proposal in court. \\"In the same week the New South Wales state premier also banned all state departments and agencies from buying bottled water because of its huge environmental footprint, joining more than 70 cities in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom that have banned bottled water in their departments.\\" In 2012, the town of Concord, Massachusetts became the first in the United States to ban the sale of bottled water. Specifically, sales of non-sparkling, unflavored drinking water in single-serving Polyethelyne terephthalate (PET) bottles of 1 litre (34 ounces) or less are prohibited. The ban went into effect on 1 January 2013. =Health concerns= In the United States, bottled water and tap water are regulated by different federal agencies: the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates bottled water and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates the quality of tap water. Under the Safe Drinking Water Act the EPA has set maximum contaminant levels for approximately 90 contaminants that might be found in drinking water and 15 secondary maximum contaminant levels. In some areas, tap water may contain added fluoride, which helps prevent tooth decay and cavities. Some bottled water manufacturers in the United States add fluoride to their product, or provide a fluoridated bottled water product. The Food and Drug Administration of the United States does not require bottled water manufacturers to list the fluoride content on the label. However, unlike tap water where the amount of fluoride added by municipalities to drinking water is not federally regulated, the FDA has set specific limits for how much fluoride may be found in bottled water. Water fluoridation remains controversial in countries that require it (the United States, United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, Australia, and a handful of other countries). Several studies have examined the content of fluoride and other chemicals in bottled water as well as the accuracy of these values as printed on the labels showing some significant difference between labeled and measured value. According to a 1999 NRDC study, in which roughly 22 percent of brands were tested, at least one sample of bottled drinking water contained chemical contaminants at levels above strict state health limits. Some of the contaminants found in the study could pose health risks if consumed over a long period of time. The NRDC report conceded that \\"most waters contained no detectable bacteria, however, and the level of synthetic organic chemicals and inorganic chemicals of concern for which [they] were tested were either below detection limits or well below all applicable standards.\\" Meanwhile, a report by the Drinking Water Research Foundation found that of all samples tested by NRDC, \\"federal FDA or EPA limits were allegedly exceeded only four times, twice for total coliforms and twice for fluorides.\\" Studies show that the plastics used for bottles contain chemicals having estrogenic activity, even when they claim otherwise. Although some of the bottled water contained in glass were found polluted with chemicals as well, the researchers believe some of the contamination of water in the plastic containers may have come from the plastic containers. Leaching of chemicals into the water is related to the plastic bottles being exposed to either low or high temperatures. A study has recently found that the vast majority of bottled water contains microplastics. Following this, the World Health Organization has launched a review into the safety of drinking microplastics. Analysis of some of the world's most popular bottled water brands found that more than 90% contained tiny pieces of plastic The tests were carried out at the State University of New York in Fredonia as part of a project involving original research and reporting by the US-based journalism organization Orb Media. Using a dye called Nile Red, which binds to free-floating pieces of plastic, the university's Prof Sherri Mason found an average of 10 plastic particles per litre of water, each larger than the size of a human hair. Smaller particles assumed to be plastic but not positively identified were found as well - an average of 314 per litre. =Safety= There have been no major outbreaks of illness or serious safety concerns associated with bottled water in the past decade, an FDA official stated in testimony before a 9 July 2009 Congressional hearing. Conversely, as noted in the Drinking Water Research Foundation's (DWRF) 2013 report, Microbial Health Risks of Regulated Drinking Waters in the United States, EPA researchers reported an estimated 16.4 million cases of acute gastrointestinal illness per year are caused by tap water. Subsequent research has estimated that number of illnesses to be closer to 19.5 million cases per year.http://thefactsaboutwater.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/CSA- FINAL-060117.pdf In addition, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that waterborne diseases, such as Cryptosporidiosis and Giardiasis, cost the U.S. healthcare system as much as $539 million a year in hospital expenses. =Bottled water versus carbonated beverages= Bottled noncarbonated drinking water competes in the marketplace with carbonated beverages (including carbonated water) sold in individual plastic bottles.Hamermesh, Daniel. Ban Water Bottles to Reduce Pollution? Come On!, Freakonomics Blog, The New York Times, 19 January 2009. Consumption of water often is considered a healthier substitute for sodas.Cutting down on liquid calories: A visual guide, Consumer Reports, August 2006. According to the Container Recycling Institute, sales of flavoured, non-carbonated drinks are expected to surpass soda sales by 2010.Gitlitz, Jennifer and Pat Franklin. \\"Water, Water Everywhere: The growth of non-carbonated beverages in the United States\\", Container Recycling Institute, February 2007. In response, Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola have introduced new carbonated drinks that are fortified with vitamins and minerals, Diet Coke Plus and Tava, marketed as \\"sparkling beverages.\\"Martin, Andrew. Makers of Sodas Try a New Pitch: They're Healthy, The New York Times, 7 March 2007. =Bottled water versus tap water= Bottled water may have reduced amounts of copper, lead, and other metal contaminants since it does not run through the plumbing pipes where tap water is exposed to metal corrosion; however, this varies by the household and plumbing system. In much of the developed world, chlorine often is added as a disinfectant to tap water. If the water contains organic matter, this may produce other byproducts in the water such as trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids, which has shown to increase the risk of cancer. The level of residual chlorine found at around 0.0002 g per litre, which is too small to cause any health problems directly. The chlorine concentration recommended by World Health Organization is between 0.0005 and 0.0002 g/L.World Health Organization, \\"How to measure chlorine residual in water\\" WHO ‚Äì Technical Notes for Emergencies, Technical Note No. 11, 4 Draft revised: 7.1.05 (pdf) The Natural Resources Defense Council, Sierra Club, and World Wildlife Fund have urged their supporters to consume less bottled water. Anti-bottled-water-campaigns and organizations, such as Corporate Accountability International, typically argue that bottled water is no better than tap water, and emphasize the detrimental environmental side- effects of disposable plastic bottles. In a 2003 episode of the Showtime series Penn & Teller: Bullshit!, restaurant diners appeared unable to discern between bottled water and water from a garden hose behind the restaurant.Bottled Water. Penn Jillette, Teller. Bullshit!. Showtime. 7 March 2003. No. 7, season 1. The documentary Tapped argues against the bottled water industry, asserting that tap water is healthier, more environmentally sustainable, and more ecologically sound than bottled water. The film focuses on the bottled water industry in the United States. The film has received largely positive reviews, and has spawned college campus groups such as Beyond the Bottle. Yet, as many people remain generally unaware of the negative health and environmental impacts associated with bottled water, recent research in environmental psychology has started to investigate how to reduce the public's consumption of bottled water.

It is located to the south east of the main village of Waddesdon. It was bought in the 1870s by a branch of the Rothschild family, and belongs to them to this day. Eythrope is Grade II listed on the National Heritage List for England, and its gardens are also grade II listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. History The hamlet name is Anglo Saxon in origin, and means \\"island farm\\", referring to an island in the River Thame that flows by the hamlet. The medieval village of Eythrope is deserted and all that remains are some earthen banks and ditches on the eastern side of Eythrope Park. There was a manor house at this hamlet as early as 1309, when it was the home of the Arches family. One former owner, Sir Roger Dynham, built a chantry chapel on what is now the site of the pavilion. This was demolished by Sir William Stanhope in the 1730s. The estate was extended in 1610 by Sir William Dormer. William Stanhope (1702‚Äì1772) embellished Eythrope House around 1750. Stanhope employed Isaac Ware to build new stables (now lost) and follies in the garden and park. Two of these buildings survive: the grotto by the lake, and the bridge over the River Thame. The house was demolished in 1810-11 by Philip Stanhope, 5th Earl of Chesterfield. In 1875, the manor at Eythrope was bought by Alice de Rothschild. She was the sister and companion of Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild who owned the neighboring estate Waddesdon Manor. The new house at Eythrope was not built on the site of the old manor. While building was in progress Alice fell ill with rheumatic fever and was advised to avoid damp conditions at night. As Eythrope was next to the river Thame, the plans were altered. The house was built without bedrooms as a place to house her collections and entertain guests during the day. Alice chose one of the Rothschild family's favourite architects George Devey who had worked at nearby Ascott House, Aston Clinton House and in the villages belonging to the Mentmore Estate. Eythrope was something of a deviation from his usual approach. It is constructed in red brick with stone dressings. With its twisting chimneys, turrets and gables, it is a mixture of Devey's usual Jacobean style and the French Renaissance architecture of Waddesdon Manor. This is especially noticeable on the concave roof to the round tower, and the gable on the garden facade which are particularly reminiscent of Waddesdon. Because of its small size the house was christened \\"The Pavilion\\" or the \\"Water Pavilion\\".Jill Allibone, George Devey Architect, 1820-1886 (Lutterworth, 1991) , 9780718827854 As in other Rothschild homes, French paneling and furniture dressed the rooms. Alice also collected Renaissance sculpture, paintings and maiolica ware. Around the house, Alice developed 30 acres of highly ornamental and innovative gardens that complemented the splendour of Waddesdon Manor. She also created a four-acre walled kitchen garden and had built an Old English Tea House (now lost) to the historic parkland. A large, rectangular stable block (listed grade II), built in stone and half-timber and three picturesque lodges, were probably designed by W Taylor & Son of Bierton. House parties from Waddesdon Manor would drive the four miles for tea, taking a steam launch up the river to the tea house. In 1922 following Alice's death, The Pavilion was inherited by James Armand de Rothschild and his wife Dorothy. From 1922 to around 1939, they let it to the wife of Somerset Maugham who added bedrooms and bathrooms in a wing that later collapsed. In the 1950s the Rothschilds decided to give Waddesdon Manor, which they also had inherited, to the National Trust and move to the smaller pavilion. The house was improved and modernized. James de Rothschild died in 1957, before the house was ready. Following the transfer of Waddesdon, his widow Dorothy moved to Eythrope. Present day Dorothy de Rothschild died in 1988 and left the estate and Pavilion to her husband's great nephew Jacob Rothschild, 4th Baron Rothschild. The house is the last of the Buckinghamshire Rothschild houses to remain in Rothschild hands. It operates as a private home. The gardens continue to be developed and maintained, growing vegetables, fruit and flowers for the estate. The walled garden was redesigned by Lady Mary Keen in 1990. Keen created several gardens at different levels within the four acre walled garden. These included a large vegetable garden, a herb garden, Mediterranean pot garden, rose garden and a long late flowering herbaceous border which runs as an artery through the gardens. A large Victorian glasshouse recreated on the foundations of an earlier glass house is used for the forcing of early cherries. Five further glasshouses are used for a variety of flowering plants and succulents and, in the summer, for growing several varieties of tomato. TV & film Scenes from And Then There Were None by Agatha Christie, screened on BBC One from 26‚Äì28 December 2015, were filmed on the Estate roads and on the bridge at Eythrope.

Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. Dictionary online. Available from http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/metalanguage Internet. Retrieved 20 November 2010 Expressions in a metalanguage are often distinguished from those in the object language by the use of italics, quotation marks, or writing on a separate line. The structure of sentences and phrases in a metalanguage can be described by a metasyntax.van Wijngaarden, A., et al. \\"Language and metalanguage.\\" Revised Report on the Algorithmic Language Algol 68. Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, 1976. 17-35.  Types  There are a variety of recognized metalanguages, including embedded, ordered, and nested (or hierarchical) metalanguages. = Embedded = An embedded metalanguage is a language formally, naturally and firmly fixed in an object language. This idea is found in Douglas Hofstadter's book, G√∂del, Escher, Bach, in a discussion of the relationship between formal languages and number theory: \\"... it is in the nature of any formalization of number theory that its metalanguage is embedded within it.\\"Hofstadter, Douglas. 1980. G√∂del, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid. New York: Vintage Books It occurs in natural, or informal, languages, as well‚Äîsuch as in English, where words such as noun, verb, or even word describe features and concepts pertaining to the English language itself. = Ordered = An ordered metalanguage is analogous to an ordered logic. An example of an ordered metalanguage is the construction of one metalanguage to discuss an object language, followed by the creation of another metalanguage to discuss the first, etc. = Nested = A nested (or hierarchical) metalanguage is similar to an ordered metalanguage in that each level represents a greater degree of abstraction. However, a nested metalanguage differs from an ordered one in that each level includes the one below. The paradigmatic example of a nested metalanguage comes from the Linnean taxonomic system in biology. Each level in the system incorporates the one below it. The language used to discuss genus is also used to discuss species; the one used to discuss orders is also used to discuss genera, etc., up to kingdoms.  In natural language  Natural language combines nested and ordered metalanguages. In a natural language there is an infinite regress of metalanguages, each with more specialized vocabulary and simpler syntax. Designating the language now as L_0, the grammar of the language is a discourse in the metalanguage L_1, which is a sublanguage nested within L_0. * The grammar of L_1, which has the form of a factual description, is a discourse in the metametalanguage L_2, which is also a sublanguage of L_0. * The grammar of L_2, which has the form of a theory describing the syntactic structure of such factual descriptions, is stated in the metametametalanguage L_3, which likewise is a sublanguage of L_0. * The grammar of L_3 has the form of a metatheory describing the syntactic structure of theories stated in L_2. * L_4 and succeeding metalanguages have the same grammar as L_3, differing only in reference. Since all of these metalanguages are sublanguages of L_0, L_1 is a nested metalanguage, but L_2 and sequel are ordered metalanguages.Ibid. p. 277. Since all these metalanguages are sublanguages of L_0 they are all embedded languages with respect to the language as a whole. Metalanguages of formal systems all resolve ultimately to natural language, the 'common parlance' in which mathematicians and logicians converse to define their terms and operations and 'read out' their formulae.  Types of expressions  There are several entities commonly expressed in a metalanguage. In logic usually the object language that the metalanguage is discussing is a formal language, and very often the metalanguage as well. = Deductive systems = A deductive system (or, deductive apparatus of a formal system) consists of the axioms (or axiom schemata) and rules of inference that can be used to derive the theorems of the system.Hunter, Geoffrey. 1971. Metalogic: An Introduction to the Metatheory of Standard First-Order Logic. Berkeley:University of California Press = Metavariables = A metavariable (or metalinguistic or metasyntactic variable) is a symbol or set of symbols in a metalanguage which stands for a symbol or set of symbols in some object language. For instance, in the sentence: :Let A and B be arbitrary formulas of a formal language L. The symbols A and B are not symbols of the object language L, they are metavariables in the metalanguage (in this case, English) that is discussing the object language L. = Metatheories and metatheorems = A metatheory is a theory whose subject matter is some other theory (a theory about a theory). Statements made in the metatheory about the theory are called metatheorems. A metatheorem is a true statement about a formal system expressed in a metalanguage. Unlike theorems proved within a given formal system, a metatheorem is proved within a metatheory, and may reference concepts that are present in the metatheory but not the object theory.Ritzer, George. 1991. Metatheorizing in Sociology. New York: Simon Schuster = Interpretations = An interpretation is an assignment of meanings to the symbols and words of a language.  Role in metaphor  Michael J. Reddy (1979) argues that much of the language we use to talk about language is conceptualized and structured by what he refers to as the conduit metaphor.Reddy, Michael J. 1979. The conduit metaphor: A case of frame conflict in our language about language. In Andrew Ortony (ed.), Metaphor and Thought. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press This paradigm operates through two distinct, related frameworks. The major framework views language as a sealed pipeline between people: 1\\\\. Language transfers people's thoughts and feelings (mental content) to others ex: Try to get your thoughts across better. 2\\\\. Speakers and writers insert their mental content into words ex: You have to put each concept into words more carefully. 3\\\\. Words are containers ex: That sentence was filled with emotion. 4\\\\. Listeners and writers extract mental content from words ex: Let me know if you find any new sensations in the poem. The minor framework views language as an open pipe spilling mental content into the void: 1\\\\. Speakers and writers eject mental content into an external space ex: Get those ideas out where they can do some good. 2\\\\. Mental content is reified (viewed as concrete) in this space ex: That concept has been floating around for decades. 3\\\\. Listeners and writers extract mental content from this space ex: Let me know if you find any good concepts in the essay.  Metaprogramming  Computers follow programs, sets of instructions in a formal language. The development of a programming language involves the use of a metalanguage. The act of working with metalanguages in programming is known as metaprogramming. Backus‚ÄìNaur form, developed in the 1960s by John Backus and Peter Naur, is one of the earliest metalanguages used in computing. Examples of modern-day programming languages which commonly find use in metaprogramming include ML, Lisp, m4, and Yacc.

The game is popular among young teenagers. Even though it might be played occasionally by young teenagers or young adults, its popularity has declined since the 1980s. Spin the bottle was very popular among teenagers during the second half of the 20th century because it fostered \\"sexual\\" interactions between boys and girls. It has even been described as \\"the party game of choice for glandularly excited high schoolers\\". It has been described as a coming-of-age party game.Spin the Bottle: Kissing Games from Romantic to Risque (2007) by Lynne Stanton. The game The game is played by several (or more) players who sit, stand, or kneel in a circle. A bottle is placed on the floor in the center of the circle. A player spins the bottle, and must kiss the person to whom the bottle points when it stops spinning. Alternatively, the person to whom the bottle is pointing must kiss the person at the rear end of the bottle. There are a very large number of variants. One variant is that instead, two players must hug within five seconds, otherwise, they have to kiss in 10 seconds and if the 10 seconds are up and they have not kissed, then they have to French kiss. Variations allow for other tasks to be accomplished. It can also be used to decide the players for other games, such as Truth or dare? or Seven minutes in heaven. Variations may also include penalties, such as removing an article of clothing. History Written records of bottle-spinning games date back to the 1920s, though early accounts make no mention of kissing. Written records of a similar game, called Bottle of Fortune, are available dating back to 1922.

Paddock Wood is the centre for hop growing in Kent. History Paddock Wood developed as a settlement during the second half of the 19th century as a result of the local hops industry.Kent Past By 1900 it was a local transport hub with three railway lines at the railway station. Government Paddock Wood has three tiers of local government: parish, borough and county. =Borough council= Since 1974 Paddock Wood has formed part of the Borough of Tunbridge Wells. The borough is governed by a 48-member council. The town elects 4 borough councillors, with 2 each for the Paddock Wood East and Paddock Wood West wards. Three are members of the Conservative Party and one is Independent . =County council= The upper tier of local government is provided by Kent County Council. The county council has 84 members, with each representing an electoral district. Paddock Wood forms part of the electoral district of Tunbridge Wells Rural. Geography View of Commercial Road facing southwest from the station The commercial areas of Paddock Wood are separated by the railway line. To the South of the railway lies Commercial Road which runs north east to south west through the town, and is the main shopping street. At the north east end of the street is the entrance to the Railway Station. Commercial Road is home to the branches of several banks, a variety of take-aways, a restaurant and a number of small shops. To the east of Commercial Road, runs Maidstone Road. This road runs north to Beltring and East Peckham, and south to Matfield, and is the main route into and out of the town. To the north of the railway line lie the industrial areas. Eldon Way Industrial Estate can be found to the east and is home to British Car Auctions, among others. To the west is the larger Transfesa Road and Paddock Wood Distribution Centre. This is the home to a number of companies including Gabriel Chemie UK Ltd, Norman Collett, CoolChain, Mack Multiples, Warburtons and a Whirlpool warehouse, which was destroyed in a large fire in early July 2005. Culture and community Mascalls Gallery, a public art gallery opened in 2006 on the site of Mascalls Academy. It had a frequently changing programme of exhibition featuring national and international known artists. These included Henry Moore, LS Lowry, Graham Sutherland and Lee Miller as well as artists from Latin America, Japan and America. In 2010 Mascalls Gallery exhibited for the first time in the UK drawings by Marc Chagall for nearby Tudeley Church. The gallery has since closed, because priorities at Mascalls have shifted, as they have nationally. Transport Paddock Wood is on the B2160 and B2161 roads and not too far from the A228, A264, A21 and A26 roads. The A21 in the area suffers from congestion and traffic problems. It is served by Paddock Wood railway station. Education The town has two schools, Paddock Wood Primary School which was built in 1909, and which has approximately 600 pupils and Mascalls Academy (formerly Mascalls School), (a comprehensive secondary school), opened in 1956 and has around 1400 pupils, and it takes its pupils from Brenchley, Matfield, Capel, Five Oak Green, East Peckham, Horsmonden, Lamberhurst and Yalding, as well as Paddock Wood itself. Literary references Some Dickens scholars believe that Paddock Wood is the rural railway station described in Dombey and Son. Some believe that one of Charles Dickens's children was buried in the graveyard as it says on the sign at the entrance.

The term was originally the name of a pioneering system of automated radio broadcasts regarding traffic conditions, introduced in the 1950s and named after its inventor, Loyd Sigmon. A Sigalert is defined by the California Highway Patrol (CHP) as \\"any unplanned event that causes the closing of one lane of traffic for 30 minutes or more\\". Caltrans uses the term \\"SigAlert\\" and defines it as any traffic incident that will tie up two or more lanes of a freeway for two or more hours. Sig Alerts are issued by the CHP and are posted on their website, broadcast on radio and television stations throughout California, and signaled to motorists via electronic message signs on the freeways. The term was added in 1993 to the New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary. In practice, there is no standard spelling; the CHP website uses \\"SIG Alerts\\" and \\"Sigalert\\" while Caltrans uses \\"Sig-Alert\\". The origin of the Sigmon traffic alerts SigAlerts originated in 1955 with the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD). By the early 1950s, the rapidly growing number of automobiles in Los Angeles had greatly increased the frequency and severity of traffic accidents and jams. Radio stations reported traffic conditions, but the LAPD refused to call radio stations with this information, so each station would call the LAPD, a process that tied up telephone lines and forced officers to repeat the same information again and again. In 1955, Loyd C. \\"Sig\\" Sigmon began developing a solution. Sigmon was executive vice president of Golden West Broadcasters (a company owned by singing cowboy Gene Autry). Sigmon had worked for Golden West's station KMPC 710 in 1941, but found himself in the United States Army Signal Corps during World War II, assigned to General Dwight D. Eisenhower's staff, in charge of non-combat radio communications in the European theater. Now, he proposed to apply his knowledge of complex radio networks to the situation in Los Angeles. Sigmon developed a specialized radio receiver and reel-to-reel tape recorder. When the receiver picked up a particular tone, it would record the subsequent bulletin. At the time, the device cost about $600 (equivalent to $5,600 in 2018). The LAPD's chief, William H. Parker, was interested, though skeptical, warning the inventor, \\"We're going to name this damn thing Sigalert.\\" More practically, he refused to use it unless the receivers were made available to all Los Angeles radio stations‚Äîit could not be a KMPC monopoly. Initially, half a dozen stations installed Sigmon receivers that had \\"Sigalert\\" stamped on their side. When a message had been received and recorded from the LAPD, a red light, sometimes accompanied by a buzzer, would alert the radio stations' engineers. Depending on the nature of the problem, the engineer could air the police broadcast immediately, interrupting regular programming if necessary. The early use of the Sigalert One of the first major \\"Sigmon traffic alerts\\" was broadcast on January 22, 1956, causing a traffic jam. The alert described the derailment of a passenger train near Los Angeles' Union Station and requested any available doctors and nurses to respond to the scene. Too many doctors, nurses and sightseers drove there, making the situation worse. The first SigAlert was on Labor Day weekend in 1955, and some stories on the SigAlert conflate these two events. At first, the LAPD issued about one alert a day, but soon other agencies were calling in messages they wanted broadcast, including rabid dog reports, gas leaks and even a ship collision in Los Angeles Harbor. A pharmacist who had made a potentially fatal error in filling a prescription took advantage of the system to warn the customer (who heard the SigAlert in time). It was also used to warn about the impending Baldwin Hills Dam collapse in 1963. The term \\"Sigalert\\" was also used in Seattle, Washington in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The CHP era and current usage In 1969, when the CHP assumed responsibility for freeway traffic from the LAPD, it took control of the SigAlert system as well. It is now used throughout California and limited to traffic situations only. Messages are still broadcast, but most radio stations now read the information from the CHP's web service rather than rebroadcasting the police dispatchers' voices. CalTrans also uses the term \\"Sig-Alert\\", and it has now come to be commonly defined as any traffic incident that will tie up two or more lanes of a freeway for two or more hours. not all California radio stations use this term. For example, radio station KABC uses the term \\"KABC Traffic Alert\\", while radio stations KNX, KFI-AM, KRLA, KQED, and KCRW use the original term.

It is located between Sunderland, Hartlepool and Durham. History The case for founding Peterlee as a new town was put forward in Farewell Squalor by Easington Rural District Council Surveyor C. W. Clarke, who also proposed that the town be named after the celebrated Durham miners' leader Peter Lee. It is one of the few places in the British Isles to be directly named after an individual, and unique among the post-Second World War new towns in having its existence requested by local people through their MP. A deputation, mostly if not wholly consisting of working miners, met the Minister of Town and Country Planning to put the case for a new town in the district. The Minister, Lewis Silkin, responded by offering a half-size new town of 30,000 residents. The subsequent new residents came largely from surrounding villages in the District of Easington. Peterlee Development Corporation was founded in 1948, first under A. V. Williams, then under Dr Monica Felton.Mark Clapson, The rise and fall of Dr. Monica Felton, British town planner & peace activist The original master plan for tower blocks of flats by Berthold Lubetkin was rejected as unsuitable for the geology of the area, which had been weakened by mining works and he resigned in 1950. George Grenfell Baines replaced Lubetkin and began to build quickly, but the result was poor-quality construction. Williams invited an artist Victor Pasmore to head the design team for the landscaping. Governance *Peterlee Town Council *Durham County Council Landmarks =Apollo Pavilion= The Apollo Pavilion The Apollo Pavilion (1970) was designed by Victor Pasmore. It provided a focal point for the Sunny Blunts estate as well as a bridge across a water-course. It was named after the Apollo moon missions. From the late 1970s the Pavilion suffered from vandals and anti-social behaviour. The murals on the building faded, and to discourage anti-social behaviour, staircases were removed in the 1980s. In 1996, there was a failed attempt to list the Pavilion. English Heritage described it as \\"an internationally important masterpiece\\". However, some local residents and councillors saw the Pavilion as an eyesore and campaigned to have it demolished. The campaign appeared to have been successful when demolition was proposed in 2000. However, in July 2009 a six-month revamp programme was completed at a cost of ¬£400,000. As part of this, original features such as the murals and stairs were reinstated. In December 2011, English Heritage gave the pavilion a Grade-II* listing. Transport =Road= Peterlee is served by the main A19 road running west of the town to Sunderland in the north and Teesside in the south, and the A1086 to its east leading to Easington in the north and Hartlepool to the south. The B1320 runs through the town centre linking the town to Horden and the A1086 in the east and Shotton Colliery and the A19 in the west. The B1432 to the north of the town centre leads to Easington Village, Hawthorn and Seaham on the route of the old A19. The A181 runs to the south-west of the town at the Castle Eden and Wingate junction on the A19 leading to Wheatley Hill, Thornley, and Durham. In 2008, the A688 was extended to the A181 at Running Waters from the A1(M) junction at Bowburn, creating a trunk road from Peterlee to the A1(M) via the A19, A181 and A688. =Buses= Peterlee is served by Arriva North East and Go North East in the local area, to Dalton Park, and to the towns and cities of Newcastle, Gateshead, Sunderland, Houghton-le-Spring, Durham, Hartlepool, Sedgefield, Newton Aycliffe, Billingham, Stockton, Middlesbrough and Darlington. =Rail= Peterlee is served by Horden railway station, approximately to east, on the Durham Coast Line.

Common to mainland Europe, the birds can also be found in northern Africa and in parts of western Asia and China. It is a non-migratory bird, but can occasionally be found as a vagrant in Great Britain. Taxonomy and systematics The crested lark was one of the many species originally described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae. It was classified in the genus Alauda until German naturalist Friedrich Boie placed it in the new genus Galerida in 1821. Colin Harrison recommended lumping members of Galerida and Lullula back into Alauda in 1865 due to a lack of defining characteristics. The current scientific name is derived from Latin. Galerida was the name for a lark with a crest, from galerum, \\"cap\\", and cristata means \\"crested\\" Alban Guillaumet and colleagues noted the distinctiveness of populations from the Maghreb - birds in the dryer parts of Morocco and Tunisia had longer bills while those in more coastal northern parts had shorter bills typical of the European subspecies. The authors sampled the mitochondrial DNA and found they were distinct genetically. Formerly, the Maghreb lark was considered as a subspecies of the crested lark. = Subspecies = Thirty-three subspecies are recognized: * Iberian crested lark (G. c. pallida) - Brehm, CL, 1858: Found in Portugal and Spain * Central European crested lark (G. c. cristata) - (Linnaeus, 1758): Found from southern Scandinavia and France east to Ukraine and Hungary * West Italian crested lark (G. c. neumanni) - Hilgert, 1907: Found in west-central Italy * Greecian crested lark (G. c. meridionalis) - Brehm, CL, 1841: Originally described as a separate species.

Found from central and eastern Pakistan through western and northern India to southern Nepal Description A fairly small lark, the crested lark is roughly the same size as a Eurasian skylark, but shorter overall and bulkier around the head and body, and very similar in appearance, with a height of and a wingspan of , weighing between . It is a small, brown bird which has a short tail with light brown outer feathers. Male and females have no real differences, but young crested larks have more spots on their back than their older counterparts. Its plumage is downy but sparse and appears whitish. The distinct crest from which the crested lark gets its name is conspicuous at all times but is more pronounced during territorial or courtship displays and when singing. In flight it shows reddish underwings. It shares many characteristics with the Thekla lark, with the main distinctions between the two being the beak, the Thekla's heavier black-brown streaks and its grey underwing, present in European specimens. Distribution and habitat Crested lark in Behbahan, Iran The crested lark breeds across most of temperate Eurasia from Portugal to north-eastern China and eastern India, and in Africa south to Niger. It is non-migratory, and the sedentary nature of this species is illustrated by the fact that it is only a very rare vagrant to Great Britain, despite breeding as close as northern France. While the bird is not commonly found in Scandinavia today, it could be found in Sweden until the 1990s, with sources reporting six individual birds in 1992 before becoming extirpated in Sweden in 1993. The birds have also been extirpated in several other European countries, including Norway (1972), Luxembourg (1973) and Switzerland (1980s). This is a common bird of dry, open country and is often seen by roadsides or in cereal fields, although it is also found occupying small, sandy patches by railways, docks and airfields. Behaviour Video of singing bird The crested lark is a songbird, and has a liquid, warbling song described onomatopoeically as a ' or a '. It sings in flight from high in the sky, at roughly above the ground. The related Eurasian skylark exhibits similar behaviour but also sings during its ascent, whereas the crested lark sings either at altitude or on the ground. Their flight pattern is an example of undulatory locomotion. =Breeding= Eggs of Galerida cristata - MHNT It nests in small depressions in the ground, often in wastelands and on the outskirts of towns. The nests are untidy structures composed primarily of dead grasses and roots. Three to five brown, finely speckled eggs, similar to those of the Eurasian skylark, are laid at a time and will hatch after . As with most larks, the chicks leave the nest early, after about eight days and take flight after reaching old. Two broods will usually be raised each year. =Food and feeding= Eating an insect Largely vegetarian birds, the crested lark primarily feeds on grains and seeds, such as oats, wheat and barley, but will also eat insects, particularly beetles, with food either being scavenged from the ground or dug up. Juvenile birds are fed by both parents, and generally leave the nest before they are able to fly to start foraging for food themselves. Relationship to humans Francis of Assisi considered the crested lark a bird of special significance, based on similarities he perceived between it and the life of the Friars Minor: its plain earth- coloured plumage and hood, its humility (\\"for it goes willingly along the wayside and finds a grain of corn for itself\\"), and its time spent in song. Status The crested lark has been categorised by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as being of least concern, meaning that it is not currently threatened with extinction. Estimates for the global population of mature individuals of the species range from 22,000,000 to 91,200,000. Figures for Europe are less varied, with estimates putting the number of breeding pairs at between 3,600,000 and 7,600,000, or between 7,200,000 and 15,200,000 individuals. In Europe, trends since 1982 have shown an overall decline in the population of the species, resulting in the assumption that the crested lark is in decline globally.

Sigmon (May 6, 1909 ‚Äì June 2, 2004) was born in Stigler, Oklahoma to a cattle-ranching family. He soon became interested in radio, earning his amateur (\\"ham\\") radio license at age 14. His broadcasting career began in 1932 at the Boston Short Wave and Television Laboratories. In 1941 he was hired as an engineer for MacMillan Petroleum Company's flagship radio station, KMPC, in Los Angeles, California. That job was interrupted by World War II; he served in the United States Army Signal Corps on General Dwight D. Eisenhower's staff. Sigmon resumed his job in Los Angeles after the war, rising to the position of Executive Vice President with Gene Autry's Golden West Broadcasters, which owned eight radio and two television stations on the west coast, including KMPC. In 1955, Sigmon invented a specialized radio and tape recorder that the Los Angeles Police Department used to alert radio stations throughout the city to traffic conditions and emergencies. The messages were referred to as \\"Sigmon traffic alerts,\\" a phrase quickly shortened to \\"Sig Alert.\\" The system, now employed throughout California, has been copied in numerous other areas. For this, Bill Keene called him the \\"father of L.A traffic reporting\\". Loyd Sigmon received recognition and honors from local and state government agencies, the National Safety Council, and broadcasting and radio organizations. In 1998, when the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) and the California Highway Patrol opened their Freeway Traffic Center in Los Angeles, Sigmon attended as their special Guest of Honor. He was quoted in the Los Angeles Times as saying, \\"I ran a multimillion-dollar corporation, but it's the Sig Alert that people remember me for.\\" Sigmon kept his amateur radio license, W6LQ, current even after retiring to Oklahoma. Sigmon died in an assisted living facility in Bartlesville, Oklahoma after suffering from Parkinson's disease. Sigmon and his wife Pat (stage name: Patricia Lee) had a home in Palm Springs, California in the late 1950s.

In April 2015, the town's Mary Dunn wellfield near a fire training academy was found to be contaminated with perfluorooctane sulfonate, and well use was suspended until costly emergency filtration with two carbon treatment units could be started. Two wells, at Hyannisport and West Hyannisport, were closed. A six-month overland interconnection with Yarmouth's water system was suggested in May and constructed in June 2015. In November 2015, the county suspended the Barnstable County Fire and Rescue Training Academy which is up gradient of the wells. but in February 2016, it still remained open.

Demographics In 2010, Hyannis had a total population of 14,089, living in 8,406 households. 19.80% of Hyannis' total 10,922 housing units were seasonally vacant. Hyannis had relatively more multi-family properties in comparison to the town and the county. Hyannis had an owner-occupancy rate of 58.3%, which was nearly 20 percentage points lower than the town or the county. This difference is associated primarily with the number of apartment properties in the village. A decline in younger, family formation households was attributed to the lack of suitable employment opportunities and \\"affordable\\" housing. The median value of owner-occupied housing units in Hyannis in 2000 was $149,720. The gross median rent in Hyannis was $718/month. In 2002, the median price for a single family home in Hyannis was $196,000.

Unemployment in Hyannis was 3.8% of the labor force. Hyannis is growing at the upper end and the lower end of the age cohorts, and although there has been an increase in persons 25 to 44 years of age, this has not necessarily been reflected in income change, as Hyannis witnessed an increase in the number of households earning $10,000 to $15,000 and an increase in the number of persons and families below the poverty level.RKG Associates Inc.

Controversies =De-merger of RIL in 2005‚Äì2006= The Ambani family holds around 45% of the shares in RIL. Since its inception, the company was managed by its founder and chairman Dhirubhai Ambani. After suffering a stroke in 1986, he handed over the daily operations of the company to his sons Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani. After the death of Dhirubhai Ambani in 2002, the management of the company was taken up by both the brothers. In November 2004, Mukesh Ambani, in an interview, admitted to having differences with his brother Anil over 'ownership issues'. He also said that the differences \\"are in the private domain\\". The share prices of RIL were impacted by some margin when this news broke out. In 2005, after a bitter public feud between the brothers over the control of the Reliance empire, mother Kokilaben intervened to broker a deal splitting the RIL group business into the two parts. In October 2005, the split of Reliance Group was formalized. Mukesh Ambani got Reliance Industries and IPCL. Younger brother Anil Ambani received telecom, power, entertainment, and financial services business of the group. The Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group includes Reliance Communications, Reliance Infrastructure, Reliance Capital, Reliance Natural Resources and Reliance Power. The division of Reliance group business between the two brothers also resulted in de-merger of 4 businesses from RIL. These businesses immediately became part of Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group. The existing shareholders in RIL, both the promoter group and non-promoters, received shares in the de-merged companies. =Relationship with ONGC= In May 2014, ONGC moved to Delhi High Court accusing RIL of pilferage of 18 billion cubic metres of gas from its gas-producing block in the Krishna Godavari basin. Subsequently, the two companies agreed to form an independent expert panel to probe any pilferage. Scams Seminar magazine (2003) detailed Reliance founder Dhirubhai Ambani's proximity to politicians, his enmity with Bombay Dyeing's Nusli Wadia, the exposes by the Indian Express and Arun Shourie about illegal imports by the company and overseas share transactions by shell companies, and the botched attempt to acquire Larsen & Toubro. As early as 1996, Outlook magazine addressed other controversies related to fake and switched shares; insider trading; and a nexus with the state-owned Unit Trust of India. Five main allegations concerning Reliance, and which have plunged the Indian capital markets into a period of uncertainty unsurpassed since the days of the securities scam were: * Reliance issued fake shares. * It switched shares sent for transfer by buyers to make illegal profits. * It has indulged in insider trading in shares. * It established a nexus with the Unit Trust of India to raise huge sums of money to the detriment of UTI subscribers. * It attempted to monopolise the private telecom services market through front companies. =Insider trading= Stock market fraud regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) issued a show-cause notice to Reliance Industries Ltd. following a probe into alleged insider trading in Reliance Petroleum Ltd (RPL) shares in November 2007. SEBI probed transactions by entities that participated in and led to some three months of speculative rally after which the RPL stock surged to an all-time intraday high of ‚Çπ295 on 1 November 2007. In a separate and independent investigation related to the same issue, the income-tax (I-T) department looked at possible tax evasion by a dozen entities that Mukesh Ambani-owned RIL acknowledged to be its \\"agents\\". In Jan 2011, Sebi barred Anil Ambani and four other officials of Reliance Group‚Äîuntil recently known as the Reliance-Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group (R-Adag)‚Äîcompanies from investing in listed shares until December 2011. Two group firms, Reliance Infrastructure Ltd (R-Infra) and Reliance Natural Resources Ltd (RNRL) were barred from making such investment until December 2012. According to Sebi's investigations, R-Infra and RNRL were prima facie responsible for misrepresenting the nature of investments in yield management certificates/deposits, and the profits and losses in their annual reports for the fiscal years 2007, 2008 and 2009. It also found misuse of FII regulations. The then minister of state for finance Namo Narain Meena, on 1 December 2009, in a written response to a query raised in the Upper House of Parliament, said that three firms of R-Adag‚ÄîR-Infra, RNRL and RCom‚Äîhad violated overseas debt norms. These end-use violations were observed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) regarding two ECB transactions‚Äîof $360 million and $150 million‚Äîby R-Infra. In another case, Sebi settled a dispute with Reliance Securities Ltd (RSL) with a consent order in June 2011, under which the brokerage will spend ‚Çπ1 crore within six months on investor education and not add any new clients for 45 days starting 15 June. In the settlement, it was also added that the brokerage will also pay ‚Çπ25 lakh towards settlement charges. This order followed a Sebi investigation into RSL's books and accounts for fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2008, which said that it had allegedly violated various clauses of Sebi stock brokers and sub-brokers regulations. The Sebi inquiry cited 20 irregularities, including the brokerage not informing clients about various charges at the time of opening accounts. RSL sought power of attorney in the name of Reliance Commodities Ltd from clients and used this to debit clients‚Äô bank accounts, purchase and sell post office deposits and government of India bonds among other transactions. Brokerage, not fully equipped to handle its customer base at the time, used the name Reliance Money at all its offices and on employee visiting cards, instead of Reliance Securities, which was the registered trading member, leading to confusion. Brokerage was found to have received funds from other client bank accounts other than the ones available to it, thus failing to have a sound third-party check on the receipt of payments. RSL had failed to update client details despite the stock exchanges pointing this out in their inspection reports. The Sebi inquiry also said RSL collected higher securities transaction tax from its clients in 2006‚Äì2008, allotted more than one terminal in the same segment for a single user, and also collected cheques in the name of Reliance Money. Brokerage also did not maintain clear segregation between broking and other activities of group companies. Further, there were frequent disruptions in the brokerage's trading platform, which showed connectivity problems at the applicant's end. =NICL= The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) filed a chargesheet in a Mumbai court against Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) and four retired employees of National Insurance Company Limited (NICL), including a former CMD, under provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act for criminal conspiracy and other charges. Acting on a reference from CVC in March, 2005, the CBI started probing the conspiracy that led to the filing of the chargesheet on December 9, 2011. The 2005 complaint had alleged irregularities in issuance of insurance policies ‚Äî for coverage of default payments ‚Äî by NICL to RIL. Chargesheet also mentioned criminal offences with dishonest intention and causing wrongful loss totaling ‚Çπ147.41 crore to NICL and wrongful gain to the private telecom provider. Two retired senior officials of National Insurance Company Limited and 11 others were awarded varying jail terms by a Delhi court in Jan 2014. =RIL plane grounded= A business jet owned by Reliance Industries (RIL) was grounded by The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on 22 March 2014 during a surprise inspection, for carrying expired safety equipment on board; its pilot was also suspended for flying without a licence.Reliance Industries#cite note-80 =Krishna Godavari (KG) Basin gas= The Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) was supposed to relinquish 25% of the total area outside the discoveries in 2004 and 2005, as per the Production Sharing Contract (PSC). However, the entire block was declared as a discovery area and RIL was allowed to retain it. In 2011, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) criticized the Oil Ministry for this decision. The CAG also faulted RIL for limiting the competition in contracts, stating that RIL awarded a $1.1 billion contract to Aker on a single-bid basis. =Petition against Reliance Jio= A PIL filed in the Supreme Court by an NGO Centre for Public Interest Litigation, through Prashant Bhushan, challenged the grant of pan-India licence to RJIL by the Government of India. The PIL alleged that RJIL was allowed to provide voice telephony along with its 4G data service, by paying an additional fees of just INR16580 million (US$280 million) arbitrary and unreasonable, and contributed to a loss of INR228420 million (US$3.8 billion) to the exchequer. The CAG in its draft report alleged rigging of the auction mechanism, whereby an unknown ISP, Infotel Broadband Services Pvt Ltd, acquired the spectrum by bidding 5000 times its net worth, after which the company was sold to Reliance Industries.

A thrust has the benefit of greater intimacy between performers and the audience than a proscenium, while retaining the utility of a backstage area. Entrances onto a thrust are most readily made from backstage, although some theatres provide for performers to enter through the audience using vomitory entrances. A theatre in the round, exposed on all sides to the audience, is without a backstage and relies entirely on entrances in the auditorium or from under the stage. As with an arena, the audience in a thrust stage theatre may view the stage from three or more sides. Because the audience can view the performance from a variety of perspectives, it is usual for the blocking, props and scenery to receive thorough consideration to ensure that no perspective is blocked from view. A high backed chair, for instance, when placed stage right, could create a blind spot in the stage left action. History The thrust stage is the earliest stage type in western theatre, first appearing in Greek theatres, and its arrangement was continued by the pageant wagon. As pageant wagons evolved into Elizabethan theatre, many of that era's works, including those of Shakespeare, were performed on theatre with an open thrust stage, such as those of the Globe Theatre. A production of Godspell performed on a 3/4 thrust stage The thrust stage concept was generally out of use for centuries, and was resurrected in 1953 by the Stratford Shakespeare Festival of Canada. Their Festival Theatre was originally under a tent, until a permanent thrust stage theatre facility was constructed in 1957. Since that time dozens of other thrust stage venues have been built using the concept.

The property contained a working farm and a mill on the Santuit River, lending its name to the road which ran nearby, Sampson's Mill Road. A list of Cotuit families with some genealogical information has been compiled by local historian James Gould. List of Cotuit Families = Modern era = In the early 20th century, Cotuit saw more commercial activity, including hotels such as The Pines, one of Cape Cod's earliest summer resorts. During World War II, Cotuit was home to Camp Candoit. During the 1970s there was a large restaurant called The Harbor View, located at 968 Main Street, which has been turned into a private residence. The Cotuit Inn was demolished in 1986, and condominiums were built in its place. In 1987 the Cotuit Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places.  Geography  The latitude of Cotuit is 41.61667. The longitude is -70.4375. According to the 1995 Town of Barnstable Comprehensive Plans, Cotuit is among the smallest of the town's seven villages, having a total area of roughly . The major part of the village is bounded on three sides by water. Although Cotuit has of coastline, comparable in length to its of scenic roadways, the 8 town-owned beaches, landings and ways to the water in the village combine to occupy only . = Central Village = Cahoon Museum of American Art The commercial zone is small, with only a few businesses located in the center of the village: a small restaurant and bar called The Kettle-Ho (named after the legend of how the town was acquired from the native Wampanoags for a kettle and a hoe, see above), a post office (02635), a Federated church (United Church of Christ/United Methodist Church), a non- profit nursery school, several real estate offices, an insurance office, an architect's office and the Cotuit Public Library. To the north on Main Street is a small variety store and the Cotuit Grocery Co. or \\"Coop\\", which sells groceries and liquor and has a small deli counter/restaurant. Other Cotuit businesses are located along Route 28 in the Santuit-Newtown area of the town, also the location of the Cotuit Center for the Arts and the Cahoon Museum of American Art. The Cahoon Museum of American Art is located at the former home of Martha and Ralph Cahoon, who were prominent American painters. A few steps from the village green is the historic Freedom Hall, currently used for various civic gatherings and elections, and Mariners' Hall, currently a Masonic Lodge. A little further down Main Street is the Museum of the Historical Society of Cotuit and Santuit, which includes the Samuel B. Dottridge Homestead, a representation of coastal life in Cotuit in the first half of the 19th century. = Santuit = The northwestern corner of Cotuit is referred to as Santuit and represents a distinct sub-village within Cotuit, marking the intersection of Main Street, Route 28 and Route 130. It is the westernmost village in the town of Barnstable and is the location of several historically significant buildings, including the Crocker House (formerly site of the Regatta Restaurant which closed in 2012), the Cahoon Museum of Art, and other colonial-era houses. The former Santuit Post Office still stands on Main Street but is now part of a private residence, though it retains the post office boxes used by Santuit residents. The former home of the EPAC Grotto of Masons is now the site of St. Michael the Archangel Antiochian Orthodox church. = Cotuit Bay = Rope's Beach looking out onto Cotuit Bay in April 2008 Cotuit Bay, the main body of water in town, is bounded by Cotuit to the west, Grand Island/Oyster Harbors to the east (part of the village of Osterville) and Dead Neck/Sampson's Island to the south, making the bay a quiet harbor and part of the so-called Three Bays system which includes North and West Bays. Sampson's Island is an Audubon bird sanctuary, jointly managed by the Three Bays Preservation organization, that can only be reached by boat. A permit is required for visitors. The bay is shallow and busy with boat traffic during the summer months. It is the site of the Cotuit Oyster Company. There are no commercial marine facilities in Cotuit Bay. The nearest source of fuel (diesel and gasoline) is in Osterville to the east. A number of local boatyards, including the renowned Pecks' Boatyard founded by Captain Leonard Peck, service boats in the harbor, but there is no commercial marina in the bay or inner harbor. A private launch service runs from the town dock from May through October, charging a small fee for trips to the mooring field (hail on VHF Channel 68). A free pump-out service for marine heads (toilets) is provided by the town harbormaster (available by hailing on radio or phoning 508-790-6273, facility also located at Crosby Yacht Yard in Osterville). Ice and groceries for visiting boaters is available ashore at the Cotuit Grocery Store on Main Street. A concrete boat ramp for small boats is located at Old Shore Road near Ropes Beach. Car and trailer parking is permitted only with a Town of Barnstable beach parking sticker, available to residents from the town's recreation department. There are several public ways to water, including Cordwood Landing off Old Post Road, Ropes Beach, Town Dock, Riley's Beach, Loop Beach, and Oregon Beach. Other public paths exist and are catalogued by the Barnstable Association of Recreational Shellfishermen.Barnstable Association of Recreational Shellfishermen Mooring is regulated by the Town of Barnstable.  Government  Cotuit is one of seven villages in the Town of Barnstable in Barnstable County. It is represented on the Barnstable Town Council by a Precinct 7 Town Councilor elected every four years. The Cotuit Fire District was incorporated by an act of the Massachusetts General Court in 1926 which grants the district the authority to establish public safety services, including a fire department and rescue personnel; a water department to provide the village with drinking water; and a Prudential Committee to oversee the budgets and infrastructure of the district. There are ten elected officials: a Moderator; three members of the Prudential Committee; three members of the Board of Water Commissioners; and three members of the Board of Fire Commissioners. Each elected official serves a three-year term. An annual district meeting is convened on the last Wednesday of May, preceded by the annual elections where one member of the Prudential, Fire and Water boards is elected by ballot.  Demographics  According to the 1995 Town of Barnstable Comprehensive plans, Cotuit, one of the less densely populated of the villages, has a year-round population of roughly 2,600, with an additional 1,600 summer residents.  Cotuit Oysters  = Cotuit Oysters = Cotuit Oysters are a distinct version of the eastern oyster species, unique to Cotuit Bay and remarkable for their flavor. Wild oysters are making a gradual comeback along some shores. \\"Seed now comes from a hatchery...but unspoiled Cotuit Bay has changed little, and the oysters still have the bright and briny flavor they are famous for.\\"Jacobsen, Rowan. A Geography of Oysters: The Connoisseur's Guide to Oyster Eating in North America, 109. New York: Bloomsbury USA, 2007. = Cotuit Oyster Company = The Cotuit Oyster Company dates back to 1837 and is still cultivating the distinctive Cotuit Oysters with their unique flavor, producing the oldest brand name of oyster in the United States. Cotuit is world-famous for its oysters, and in years past they rivaled Wellfleet oysters and could be found on menus in restaurants from San Francisco to Paris. In the 1980s, however, many of the Cotuit oyster beds were significantly diminished. Today, Cotuit Oysters are re-appearing on the menus of many fine-dining establishments on Cape Cod and in Boston, and the world-famousNation's Restaurant News, July 27, 1998 Oyster Bar Restaurant in Grand Central Terminal in New York City.  Recreation  = Cotuit Skiffs = Cotuit Skiffs, formerly known as Cotuit Mosquitos, are gaff-rigged \\"one-design\\" sailboats that have been sailed on the waters of Cotuit Bay for the last 104 years, making them one of the oldest continuously sailed fleets of one-design racing boats in the world. They were designed by Stanley Butler after the turn of the 19th century and were modeled after the flat-bottomed skiffs used in the oyster and commercial clam trade. Those boats were built with hard chines and low gunwales to provide a stable platform from which to clam from. The design was altered many times until 1926 when the design was standardized. Cotuit Skiffs are rigged like classic Cape Cod catboats‚Äîthat is they carry only a gaff-rigged mainsail, no jib, and their masts are stepped in the very bow of the boat. They carry a considerable amount of sail and are considered an extremely challenging boat to sail, especially in a brisk breeze. They are fitted with a centerboard and are generally raced by one or two people, with three carried only in high winds. The huge mainsail and its boom overhang the hull's transom by four feet. Since 1906 the Cotuit Mosquito Yacht Club (CMYC) has hosted races during the summer months. Although the yacht club has had more than one fleet‚Äîjuniors compete in inter-club regatta in 420s - the gaff-rigged skiff has been raced for slightly over the 100 years that the yacht club has existed. The CMYC is supported by the Association of the Cotuit Mosquito Yacht Club, a non-profit organization that manages a sailing instructional program for children between 8 and 18 years of age. CMYC historian Larry Odence published a comprehensive history of the Cotuit Skiff in 2009: Mosquito Boats: The First Hundred Years of the Cotuit Skiff, which was published in a limited edition, but available for loan from the Cotuit Library. = Cotuit Kettleers and the Cape Cod Baseball League = Joe Girardi played for the Cotuit Kettleers in 1984. The Cotuit Kettleers is an amateur collegiate summer baseball team in the Cape Cod Baseball League. The team plays its home games at Lowell Park, and has been supported by the Cotuit Athletic Association since 1947. Currently managed by Mike Roberts, the Kettleers have won more Cape League titles than any team in league history, and have featured dozens of players who went on to careers in Major League Baseball, such as Will Clark, Joe Girardi, and Chase Utley.

The village of Osterville is located on the south side of Barnstable on Nantucket Sound. Osterville is a residential community that includes marshes, bays, ponds, a small lake, beaches, and a small business district. History Osterville was originally named Cotacheset, based on the Native American name for the area. Over time it became a center for \\"oystering\\" (harvesting wild oysters) and was renamed Oysterville. Later a map misspelled the name as Osterville and the village became so. The following is from the memoirs of Sarah Hallet Boult, Osterville, MA, age 93, as of March 1, 1955: Membership in the Osterville Historical Society is not limited but village-wide and open to all who are making history today, steadily swarming over the pleasant acres that ‚ÄúPaupinanack sold for a copper kettle and some fencing done.‚Äù How many years ago? About 1648 The range of ‚ÄúCotacheset‚Äù was along East Bay and the Centerville River, and when a man said he was going down to Kocochoice, he meant where Crosby‚Äôs boat shop is now, along West Bay. The part of the David Estate that adjoins Marstons Mills was known as Mystic. The Shawme Indians being neighbors to Roger Goodspeed who was the first to venture into this territory. The Historical Society all began when a small group of three people recalling old tales of older generations. Promptly the group increased and interest as well, in back tracking to the very first, few that planted another firm foothold on Cape Cod sand. About Osterville's business district includes a public library, gift stores, women's fashions, restaurants, a small market, banks with ATMs, a pizza place, package store (spirits), a U.S. Post Office, a hardware store, art galleries, barber and beauty shops, and real estate brokers. During July and August, Osterville's population swells due to seasonal residents. Many summer residents maintain a second house in Osterville while residing most of the year in the Greater Boston area. The village is known for its oceanfront estates. The cemetery for the village of Osterville is the Hillside Cemetery on Old Mill Road. The Osterville Historical Museum, established in 1931, preserves the history of Osterville for all of those who love her, past, present, and future. The museum includes the largest collection of wooden boats in Massachusetts and is home to the Crosby Boats. The Crosbys are America's oldest, currently active, wooden boat building family. The Cammett House, the oldest house in Osterville, and the Captain Jonathan Parker House, owned by a 1820s coastal schooner captain, are also located on the museum campus. A series of boat shops includes the 1850 original Herbert F. Crosby boat shop. Every Friday mid-June to mid-September, the museum hosts the Osterville Farmers' Market. Armstrong-Kelley Park, the oldest and largest privately owned park on Cape Cod, is located in Osterville. Crosby Boat Yard is port to the Crosby catboat, and the Wianno senior, the latter a favorite of nearby Hyannisport resident President John F. Kennedy.

The sides are actually ladders attached to serve as containment of hay or grain, and may be removed, such as for hauling timber. A wagon or waggon is a heavy four-wheeled vehicle pulled by draught animals or on occasion by humans, used for transporting goods, commodities, agricultural materials, supplies and sometimes people. Wagons are immediately distinguished from carts (which have two wheels) and from lighter four-wheeled vehicles primarily for carrying people, such as carriages. Animals such as horses, mules, or oxen usually pull wagons. One animal or several, often in pairs or teams may pull wagons. However, there are examples of human-propelled wagons, such as mining corfs. A wagon was formerly called a wain and one who builds or repairs wagons is a wainwright. More specifically, a wain is a type of horse- or oxen-drawn, load-carrying vehicle, used for agricultural purposes rather than transporting people. A wagon or cart, usually four-wheeled; for example, a haywain, normally has four wheels, but the term has now acquired slightly poetical connotations, so is not always used with technical correctness. However, a two-wheeled \\"haywain\\" would be a hay cart, as opposed to a carriage. Wain is also an archaic term for a chariot. Wain can also be a verb, to carry or deliver, and has other meanings. A person who drives wagons is called a \\"wagoner\\", a \\"teamster\\", a \\"bullocky\\", a \\"muleskinner\\", or simply a \\"driver\\". Terminology and design The exact name and terminology used is often dependent on the design or shape of the wagon. If low and sideless it may be called a dray, trolley or float. When traveling over long distances and periods, wagons may be covered with cloth to protect their contents from the elements; these are \\"covered wagons\\". If it has a permanent top enclosing it, it may be called a \\"van\\". Turning radius was a longstanding problem with wagons, dictated by the distance between the front wheels and the bed of the wagon‚Äînamely, the point where the rotating wheels collide with the side of the wagon when turning. Many earlier designs required a very large turning radius; however, shrinking the width of the bed means decreasing the size of the load. As this is a problem that carts (by virtue of their two-wheeled nature) do not face, this factor, combined with their lighter weight, meant that carts were long preferred over wagons for many uses. The general solutions to this problem involved several modifications to the front-axle assembly. The front axle assembly of a wagon consists of an axle, a pair of wheels and a round plate with a pin in its centre that sits halfway between the wheels. A round plate with a hole in its centre is located on the underside of the wagon. The plate on the wagon, in turn, sits on the plate on the axle between the wheels. This arrangement allows the axle and wheels to turn horizontally. The pin and hole arrangement could be reversed. The horse harness is attached to this assembly. To enable the wagon to turn in as little space as possible, the front pair of wheels are often made smaller than the rear pair to allow them to turn close under the vehicle sides, and to allow them to turn still further, the wagon body may be waisted. This technique eventually led to further designs well-adapted to narrow areas; the front wheels of express wagons, trolleys and floats are small enough to turn under the vehicle's body. Types of wagons A Conestoga wagon, a type of freight wagon used extensively in the United States and Canada in the 18th and 19th centuries for long-distance hauling A bakery delivery wagon in Queensland, Australia Vardo from England The \\"Lion Tableau\\" circus parade wagon, built in 1904 Wagons have served numerous purposes, with numerous corresponding designs. As with motorized vehicles, some are designed to serve as many functions as possible, while others are highly specialized. This section will discuss a broad overview of the general classes of wagons; for details on specific types of wagons, see the individual links. =Farm wagon= Farm wagons are built for general multi-purpose usage in an agricultural or rural setting. These include gathering hay, crops and wood, and delivering them to the farmstead or market. A common form found throughout Europe is the leiterwagen (\\"ladder wagon\\"), a large wagon where the sides often consist of ladders strapped in place to hold in hay or grain, though these could be removed to serve other needs. A common type of farm wagon particular to North America is the buckboard. =Freight wagon= Freight wagons are wagons used for the overland hauling of freight and bulk commodities. In the United States and Canada, the Conestoga wagon was a predominant form of wagon used for hauling freight in the late 18th and 19th centuries, often used for hauling goods on the Great Wagon Road in the Appalachian Valley and across the Appalachian Mountains. Even larger freight wagons existed. For instance, the \\"twenty-mule team\\" wagons, used for hauling borax from Death Valley, could haul per pair. The wagons‚Äô bodies were long and deep; the rear wheels were in diameter. = Delivery wagon = A delivery wagon is a wagon used to deliver merchandise such as milk, bread, or produce to houses or markets, as well as to commercial customers, often in urban settings. The concept of express wagons and of paneled delivery vans developed in the 19th century. By the end of the 19th century, delivery wagons were often finely painted, lettered and varnished, so as to serve as advertisement for the particular business through the quality of the wagon. Special forms of delivery wagon include an ice wagon and a milk wagon. =Nomadic wagons= Some wagons are intended to serve as mobile residences or workshops. These include the Vardo, a traditional wagon of the 19th-century British Romani people. =Steam wagons= The steam wagon, a self-powered development of the horse-drawn wagon, was a surprisingly late innovation, entering service only in the late nineteenth century. = Irrigation = Horse wagon for irrigation, 2018 In the city center of Schw√§bisch Gm√ºnd, Germany, since 1992 the city's plants are irrigated using a horse-drawn wagon with a water tank.Ein PS f√ºr 160 Blumenk√ºbel, Gm√ºnder Tagespost, Article dated July 31, 2015 Wagon train In migration and military settings, wagons were often found in large groups called wagon trains. In warfare, large groups of supply wagons were used to support traveling armies with food and munitions, forming \\"baggage trains\\". During the American Civil War, these wagon trains would often be accompanied by the wagons of private merchants, known as sutlers, who sold goods to soldiers, as well as the wagons of photographers and news reporters. Special purpose-built support wagons existed for blacksmithing, telegraphy and even observation ballooning. In migration settings, such as the emigrant trails of the American West and the Great Trek of South Africa, wagons would travel together for support, navigation and protection. A group of wagons may be used to create an improvised fort called a laager, made by circling them to form an enclosure. In these settings, a chuckwagon is a small wagon used for providing food and cooking, essentially a portable kitchen.  Wagons in art  A detail of alt=An oil painting of a large steerable cart being drawn by two strong horses through a river As a common, important element in history and life, wagons have been the subjects of artwork. Some examples are the paintings The Hay Wain and The Haywain Triptych, and on the Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar. Motorized wagons During a transition to mechanized vehicles from animal powered, the term wagon was sometimes used such as with the Duryea Motor Wagon. In modern times the term station wagon survives as a type of automobile. It describes a car with a passenger compartment that extends to the back of the vehicle, that has no trunk, that has one or more rear seats that can be folded making space for carrying cargo, as well as featuring an opening tailgate or liftgate.

Once devoted to agricultural pursuits, West Barnstable now is largely residential and historic. Natural features These include six-mile long Sandy Neck Barrier Beach which protects the extensive Great Marshes, the latter a source of salt hay that attracted the first English settlers to the area in the mid-17th century. Notable people Remarkably, in the 18th century, the village produced four nationally prominent leaders at a time when there were no more than 500 inhabitants. James OtisJames Otis the Patriot the Patriot was the original intellectual leader of the revolutionary movement in Boston in the years leading up to the War of Independence. His sister, Mercy Otis Warren,Mercy Otis Warren also born next to the Great Marshes, became a political activist, one of the first women writers in the country, and a historian of note. She is a member of the Women's Hall of Fame. Lemuel Shaw, another native of the village, held the important post of chief justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court from 1830 to 1860 and earned the reputation of a leading jurist in the nation's formative constitutional history. The fourth native, Captain John \\"Mad Jack\\" Percival, rose to the highest rank in the U.S. Navy, serving in four wars. In late 1844 he saved and restored the U.S. frigate Constitution and then sailed her around the world, the venerable ship's only circumnavigation. Description The fully restored 1717 Congregational meetinghouse, West Parish of Barnstable, UCC, (West Parish Memorial Foundation) remains a central feature of the village. Also in the center of town, The Old Village Store is a historic and prominent place for locals. Sandy Neck Beach, the largest beach on the mid-cape, is located in the village. Most of West Barnstable consists of Sandy Neck, the Great Marsh/Barnstable Harbor, and the popular West Barnstable Conservation Area. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries a number of Finnish immigrants settled here, and, to this day, the eastern side of the village is known as \\"Finn Town\\", while the area near the West Barnstable Train StationCape Cod Chapter, National Railway Historical Society - Non-profit historical group restoring the West Barnstable Train Station. is known as \\"Shark City\\" reputedly because of the card sharks who hung out there.

Graves (December 21, 1914 ‚Äì January 3, 1986) was a professor of psychology and originator of the emergent cyclical theory of adult human development, aspects of which were later popularised as Spiral Dynamics. He was born in New Richmond, Indiana. Education and academic career Graves graduated from Union College in New York in 1940 and received his master's degree and PhD in psychology in 1943 and 1945, respectively, from Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. He taught at Western Reserve for three years before returning to Union College as an Associate Professor in 1948. He was promoted to full Professor in 1956, and retired in 1978. In 1975, Don Edward Beck, a professor at North Texas University, sought Graves out on the basis of his 1974 article in The Futurist. By this point, Graves's health was declining, and Beck resolved to record Graves's knowledge. They were later joined by Christopher Cowan, with whom Beck developed Spiral Dynamics as an extension of Graves's work. After Graves's death, Cowan, his consulting partner Natasha Todorovic, and archivist William R. Lee, became custodians of Graves's work, maintaining the official Clare W. Graves web site, which provides access to some of those materials.Butters (2015), p. 71 Emergent cyclical theory In the early mid-twentieth century, Graves decided to conduct experiments that he hoped would reconcile the various approaches to human nature and questions about psychological maturity,Rice (2018), para. 5 as he saw elements of truth and error in all theories known at the time.Graves (2005), pp. 14, 32-42 Rather than construct a hypothesis about how the conflicting systems could be resolved, Graves posed several open-ended questions and looked to see what patterns would emerge from his data. While not typical at the time, these approaches would later become known as grounded theory and inductive thematic analysis.Rice (2018), paras. 5, 7 Based on data collected over the next several decades, Graves observed that the emergence within humans of new bio-psycho-social systems in response to the interplay of external conditions with neurology follows a hierarchy in several dimensions, though without guarantees as to time lines or even direction: both progression and regression are possibilities in his model. Furthermore, each level in the hierarchy alternates as the human is either trying to make the environment adapt to the self, or the human is adapting the self to the existential conditions. He called these 'express self' and 'deny self' systems, and the swing between them is the cyclic aspect of his theory. Graves saw this process of stable plateaus interspersed with change intervals as never ending, up to the limits of the brain of Homo sapiens, something he viewed as far greater than we have yet imagined.Graves (2005), pp. 184-191 Influence Graves's emergent cyclical theory has been influential in psychology,LaBier (1971) philosophy,Freinacht (2017) spirituality,Wilber (2006) education, economics, geopolitical conflict resolution, cultural analysis, and management theory.A.C. Beck et al (1972)Flowers and Hughes (1973) While Graves's work is most broadly known through consultants working with the Spiral Dynamics (SD) or Spiral Dynamics Integral (SDi) adaptations, or through SDi's influence on the Integral movement, these adaptations were not created and popularized until a decade after his death. During his lifetime, Graves worked within academia, with his theories occasionally finding broader audiences such as through the magazine The Futurist.Graves (1974) =Metamodernism= Metamodern philosophers Daniel G√∂rtz and Emil Friis, writing as Hanzi Freinacht, have described a four-part developmental stage theory as part of their metamodern approach to politics. In addition to the four parts, they include an overall assessment which is explicitly described as a revision of Spiral Dynamics, which they call the \\"effective value meme.\\"Freinacht (2017), pp. 171, 305-350 One of the four parts, the \\"symbol-stage\\" or \\"cultural code\\", uses the same names and Spiral Dynamics-derived patterns as are used for the effective value memes.Freinacht (2017), pp. 211-247 G√∂rtz and Friis associate metamodernism with the first level of the second cycle of levels, which Graves described as \\"being\\" levels as opposed to the \\"surviving\\" levels of the first cycle.Freinacht (2017), pp. 305-350 Works Graves worked towards a book describing his theories, but published few articles and gave few public talks on his work during his lifetime. A full chronological bibliography is available online; a selection of his most notable publications is provided below. Graves was reportedly distressed by the poor reception given to Abraham Maslow at an American Psychological Association seminar in the mid 1950sCowan and Todorovic (2005), p. iv and determined not to publish his full theory until he was confident he could defend it.Graves (2005), pp. 5-6 Due to a brain injury sustained in 1975,Graves (2005), p. 5 Graves abandoned his book manuscript in 1977.Cowan and Todorovic (2005), p. v The manuscript, consisting of largely complete drafts of sections describing the derivation of the theory from experimental data, and comparing it to other theories, was edited together with other primary sources to reconstruct the missing section on the nature of the levels, and published posthumously in 2005 as The Never Ending Quest.Cowan and Todorovic (2005), pp. v-x Additionally, an edited transcription of a seminar given by Graves at the Washington School of Psychiatry in 1971, along with a reprint of his 1970 article in the Fall 1970 issue of the Journal of Humanistic Psychology, were collected and published in book form in 2004 as Levels of Human Existence. *Graves, Clare W.

All three actresses were nominated for the Academy Award, Crain for Best Actress in a Leading Role, and Barrymore and Waters for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. The film was adapted from the Cid Ricketts Sumner's 1946 novel Quality by Philip Dunne and Dudley Nichols and directed by Elia Kazan. Pinky was released by Twentieth Century Fox to both critical acclaim and controversy. Plot Jeanne Crain and Ethel Waters Pinky Johnson (Jeanne Crain) returns to the South to visit Dicey (Ethel Waters), the illiterate black laundress grandmother who raised her. Pinky confesses to Dicey that she passed for white while studying to be a nurse in the North. She had also fallen in love with white Dr. Thomas Adams (William Lundigan), who knows nothing about her black heritage. Pinky is harassed by racist local law enforcement while attempting to reclaim money owed to her grandmother. Later two white men try to sexually assault her. Dr. Canady (Kenny Washington), a black physician, asks Pinky to train black students who want to become nurses, but Pinky tells him she plans to return North. Dicey asks her to stay temporarily to care for her ailing, elderly white friend and neighbor, Miss Em (Ethel Barrymore). Pinky has always disliked Miss Em and lumps her in with the other bigots in the area. Pinky relents and agrees to tend Miss Em after learning that she personally cared for Dicey when she had pneumonia. Pinky nurses the strong-willed Miss Em, but does not hide her resentment. As they spend time together, however, she grows to like and respect her patient. Miss Em bequeaths Pinky her stately house and property when she dies, but greedy relative Melba Wooley (Evelyn Varden) challenges the will. Everyone advises Pinky that she has no chance of winning, but something she herself does not fully comprehend makes her go on. Pinky begs retiring Judge Walker (Basil Ruysdael), an old friend of Miss Em's, to defend her in court. With great reluctance, he agrees to take the case. Pinky washes clothes by hand when her grandmother is sick in order to pay court expenses. At the trial, despite hostile white spectators and the non-appearance of the only defense witness, presiding Judge Shoreham unexpectedly rules in Pinky's favor. When Pinky thanks her attorney, he coldly informs her that justice was served, but not the interests of the community in his opinion. Tom, who has tracked Pinky down, wants her to sell the inherited property, resume her masquerade as a white woman, marry him and leave the South, but she refuses, firmly believing that Miss Em intended her to use the house and property for some purpose. As a result, they part. In the end, Pinky establishes \\"Miss Em's Clinic and Nursery School\\" within her community.

In the end, Jeanne Crain was chosen for the role. Elia Kazan, who took over directing duties after John Ford was fired, was not happy with the casting choice. He later said, \\"Jeanne Crain was a sweet girl, but she was like a Sunday school teacher. I did my best with her, but she didn't have any fire. The only good thing about her was that it went so far in the direction of no temperament that you felt Pinky was floating through all of her experiences without reacting to them, which is what 'passing' is.\\"Bourne 2007, pp.74‚Äì75 Critical reception The film enjoyed wide success in the southern United States, but was banned by the city of Marshall, Texas for its subject matter. There, W.L. Gelling managed the segregated Paramount Theater, where black people were restricted to sitting in the balcony. Gelling booked Pinky for exhibition in February 1950, a year in which the First Amendment did not protect movies, per Mutual Film Corporation v. Industrial Commission of Ohio (1915). The City Commission of Marshall \\"reactivated\\" the Board of Censors, established by a 1921 ordinance, and designated five new members who demanded the submission of the picture for approval. The board disapproved its showing, stating in writing its \\"unanimous opinion that the said film is prejudicial to the best interests of the citizens of the City of Marshall.\\" Gelling, nonetheless, exhibited the film and was charged with a misdemeanor. Three members of the Board of Censors testified that they objected to the picture because it depicts (1) a white man retaining his love for a woman after learning that she is a Negro, (2) a white man kissing and embracing a Negro woman, and (3) two white ruffians assaulting Pinky after she has told them she is colored. Gelling was convicted and fined $200. He appealed the conviction to the U.S. Supreme Court. After Gelling filed his appeal, the court decided the landmark free speech case of Joseph Burstyn, Inc v. Wilson (1952) that extended First Amendment protection to films. The court then overturned Gelling's conviction. Box-office performance Pinky was Twentieth Century Fox's second most successful film of 1949 after I Was a Male War Bride and was the sixth highest-grossing film of that year.

Born in Connecticut, he moved to New York with his family, where he learned several Iroquoian languages and worked as an interpreter in the fur trade. He was well-equipped to work with Mohawk and other Iroquois Confederacy warriors who became allies of the British during the rebellion. During the War, Butler led Seneca and Cayuga forces in the Saratoga campaign in New York. He later raised and commanded a regiment of rangers, which included affiliated Mohawk and other Iroquois nations' warriors. They conducted raids in central New York west of Albany, including what became known among the rebels as the Cherry Valley Massacre. After the war Butler resettled in Upper Canada, where he was given a grant of land by the Crown for his services. Butler continued his leadership in the developing province, helping to found the Anglican Church of Canada and Masonic Order, and serving in public office. Early life John Butler was born to Walter Butler and Deborah Dennison, n√©e Ely, in New London, Connecticut in 1728. In 1742, his father moved the family to Fort Hunter on the frontier in the Mohawk Valley near the modern village of Fonda, New York. In 1752, John Butler married Catharine (Catalyntje) Bradt, of Dutch ancestry. The couple raised five children (two others died in infancy). Having learned several Iroquois and other Indigenous languages, Butler was employed as an interpreter, especially in the lucrative fur trade. French and Indian War In 1755, John Butler was appointed to the rank of Captain in the Indian Department of the British colonial government. He served in the French and Indian War under Sir William Johnson. In 1758, he saw action with James Abercromby at Fort Ticonderoga and John Bradstreet at the Battle of Fort Frontenac. In 1759, he was made second in command of the Indians with Johnson at the Battle of Fort Niagara. In 1760, he continued as a second in command of the Indians in Jeffery Amherst's force at Montreal. Pre-American Revolution years After the war Butler returned to the Mohawk Valley in New York. He acquired more land, building an estate of 26,000 acres (105 km¬≤) at Butlersbury near the major Mohawk village of Caughnawaga. He was second only to Sir William Johnson, British Superintendent of Indian Affairs, as a wealthy frontier land owner, and worked under Johnson for the British. Butler was also appointed a judge in the Tryon County court and was commissioned Lt.-Colonel of Guy Johnson's regiment of Tryon County militia. Butler was elected as one of the two members representing Tryon County in the New York assembly. American Revolutionary War John Butler returned to service, as a Loyalist, when the American Revolution turned to war in 1775. In May 1775, he left for Canada in the company of Daniel Claus, Walter Butler, Hon Yost Schuyler and Joseph Brant, a Mohawk leader. On July 7, they reached Fort Oswego and in August, Montreal. Butler participated in the defense of Montreal against an attack led by Ethan Allen. In November, Carleton sent him to Fort Niagara with instructions to keep the Indians neutral. His oldest son, Walter Butler served with him, but his wife and other children were detained by the American rebels. In March 1776, John Butler sent a party of about 100 allied Indians to Montreal to force the Americans out of Quebec. In May, Butler received instructions to use a warrior party of the Six Nations in an attack on New York. On June 5 he received instructions to send as many Indians as he could to Fort Oswego for an attack on Fort Stanwix as a part of the Saratoga campaign. He was put second in command of the Indians, primarily warriors of bands of four nations of the Iroquois, under Daniel Claus. John Butler led the Indians and a small number of Loyalists, in a successful ambush, of rebel militia and Oneida warriors in the Battle of Oriskany. As a result, after this expedition he was commissioned a lieutenant colonel and given authority to raise his own regiment, which became known as Butler's Rangers, initially with a strength of eight companies. He traveled back to Fort Niagara, and completed recruiting the first company in December. In July 1778, John Butler led his rangers and Iroquois allies at the Battle of Wyoming, in which he defeated Zebulon Butler and took Forty Fort. The Patriots suffered heavy losses, and after the battle Butler's Rangers burned many of the colonists' homes in the area. Later, the battle was referred to as the Wyoming Valley massacre because some of the victorious Loyalists and Iroquois were said to have executed and scalped prisoners and fleeing enemy soldiers. Later that year, after the burning of Tioga, his son Captain Walter Butler led two companies of rangers and 300 Iroquois warriors in a raid which was later referred to as the Cherry Valley massacre. The name of Butler was thereafter anathema to the rebels.And to their supporters in England. On Dec. 7, 1778, Marquis Rockingham introduced a motion in the House of Lords condemning the atrocities. Earl Camden was the last speaker in the debate, and after describing some of the administration's actions and statements, asked, \\"What was that hell-hound‚Äîhe asked pardon for the expression, but he could give him no other title‚Äîcolonel Butler, doing now?\\" 20 Cobbett/Hansard, Parliamentary History, 43. He ended with a general denunciation of the administration's policy in America. Its policy was \\"one of the most plain and palpable proofs of weakness, incapacity, and cowardice, that ever was seen.

Id. John Butler's unit of rangers was spread, through frontier outposts, from Niagara to Illinois County, Virginia. Butler commanded his rangers from his headquarters of Fort Niagara. In 1779, he was defeated, by the Sullivan Expedition, at the Battle of Newtown, and withdrew to Fort Niagara. Bust of John Butler, at the Valiants Memorial, in Ottawa, capital of Canada Post-war years and death At the end of the Revolution, John Butler was given a land grant in the Niagara region by the Crown for his services during the war and as compensation for his property in New York having been confiscated. He developed it for agriculture. He became one of the political leaders of Upper Canada, later called Ontario. He was appointed as a Deputy Superintendent for the Indian Department, a Justice of the Peace, and the local militia commander. He was also prominent in establishing the Anglican Church and Masonic Order in Ontario. Butler died, at his home, at age 68 in Niagara, Upper Canada, British Canada, now Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario, on May 12, 1796. His wife had died three years before. Butler was survived by their three sons and daughter. John Butler is interred in the family burial ground in Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario. Legacy *Col. John Butler School in Niagara-On-The-Lake was named after him, as are numerous other public and private establishments, including a Best Western Hotel, a sports bar, a street leading to the family burial ground on land that was his former property, and the Butler's Barracks established after the War of 1812. The latter has been designated as a National Historic Site. *In 2006, a life-sized bronze bust of Butler was installed at the Valiants Memorial in Ottawa. Alongside Mohawk leader Joseph Brant, he is considered a key player in the founding of British North America and late eighteenth-century Canada. *In 2010, a bust was installed on top of a memorial cairn at the site of his homestead on Balmoral Drive in Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario.

The ES stands for Electric Spanish, and Gibson designated it \\"150\\" because they priced it (in an instrument/amplifier/cable bundle) at around $150. The particular sound of the instrument came from a combination of the specific bar-style pickup and its placement, and the guitar's overall construction. It became famous due in large part to its endorsement by notable guitar players including Charlie Christian. After Gibson introduced it in 1936, it immediately became popular in jazz orchestras. Unlike the usual acoustic guitars in jazz bands of the period, it was loud enough to take a more prominent position in ensembles. Gibson produced the guitar with minor variations until 1940, when the ES-150 designation (the \\"V2\\") denoted a model with a different construction and pickup. History Magazine advertising. The ES-150 was developed and released in association with two US retailers, Montgomery Ward and Spiegel. It was preceded by Gibson adding ancillary piezo pickups to its regular acoustic guitars. The company had developed an electromagnetic pickup in 1935 (the now-famous \\"bar pickup\\", named for its shape), which was initially factory-installed only on lap steel guitar (EH) models, then offered as an accessory and finally installed on acoustic guitars (the L-00 and L-1 models). These electrified guitars were so successful that in the summer of 1936, two retailers, Montgomery Ward and Spiegel May Stern, suggested that Gibson build what became the ES model. Montgomery Ward was the first to offer them for sale, as the 1270 model. It had Gibson's bar pickup (though with rounded bobbins, as opposed to the hexagonal pickup Gibson later installed on its own factory models), and a volume control (no tone control); like Spiegel's 34-S model (first advertised in 1937) it lacked any Gibson identification. Spiegel received 42 of these instruments between January and August 1937 before it cut them from the catalog. The contract with Montgomery Ward ran until 1940, and Gibson made an estimated 900 instruments with the 1270 designation. Gibson's \\"own\\" ES-150, a \\"more-upmarket ES model\\" compared to the Ward and Spiegel models, had minor changes from the contract models, such as a solid carved spruce top, maple back and sides, and an adjustable truss rod. They shipped the first guitar to Bailey's House of Music on November 20, 1936. The instrument sold for $155 including cord, six-tube amplifier, and case. The pickup placement, closer to the instrument's neck than on Gibson's EH steel guitars and on guitars made by other manufacturers, produced a warmer, less \\"trebly\\" tone that was favorably received by jazz and blues players. In 1937, the model's peak year, Gibson shipped an average of forty guitars a month. In early 1937, Gibson began shipping two four-string versions: a tenor guitar (the EST-150, with a 23\\" scale, renamed the ETG-150 in 1940) and a plectrum version (the EPG-150, with a 27\\" scale). Early players included Eddie Durham, Floyd Smith and, the most famous of them, Charlie Christian, who bought an ES-150 in 1936. His joining the Benny Goodman Sextet in August 1939 gave the ES-150 \\"a near-mythical status\\" (aided by a feature in that year's December issue of Down Beat). Gibson introduced two new variations in August 1938: the cheaper ES-100 (with a smaller body and different pickup), and an upscale version, the ES-250 (with a different peghead, fancier inlays, and a pickup with individual pole pieces instead of a bar). Each with case and amplifier, the ES-100 sold for $117.50 and the ES-250 started at $253. By 1940, sales had slumped, and Gibson enhanced the model, changing to pickups with Alnico magnets‚Äîthe forerunner of the P-90, which is still in production. They installed the new pickups on all their electric models, starting in July 1940, renaming the ES-100 and 250 to ES-125 and 300). On the ES-150, Gibson moved the pickup (with adjustable individual poles) closer to the bridge for a more \\"biting\\" sound for soloing. Gibson still installed bar-style pickups on request on post-1940 models for Hank Garland, Barry Galbraith, and Barney Kessel. Gibson formally reintroduced the bar pickup in 1958 as a $60 option‚Äîannouncing it with the question, \\"Remember the straight-bar pickup that was made famous by Charlie Christian?\\" Later models In the late 1960s, Gibson introduced the ES-150DC, which was a significantly different instrument, despite its similar model number. The ES-150DC was a hollowbody electric guitar with a double-cutaway body similar in appearance to the semi- hollow 335 guitars (except for a greater body thickness). It featured two humbuckers, a rosewood fingerboard with small block inlays, and a master volume knob on the lower cutaway. This model, however, was not particularly popular, and it was discontinued by Gibson in the mid-1970s. 1968 Gibson ES-150DW in Walnut Finish Production numbers Shipping numbers for the ES-150 in its first full year, 1937, were relatively strong at 464. Thirty- seven EST-150s and one single EPG-150 were shipped in 1937. Of the ES-250, 14 were shipped in 1939. By that year, sales of the ES-150 had dwindled to about 20 units on average per month. *ES-150: 23 (1936); 464 (1937); 362 (1938); 252 (1939); 218 (1940); total 1,319 *EST-150: 37 (1937); 22 (1938); 15 (1939); 19 (1940); total 93 *EPG-150: 1 (1937) \\"Charlie Christian pickup\\" The Charlie Christian pickup, as the bar-style pickup of the early ES-150 models came to be known, was a departure from previous pickups. Earlier pickups featured either a horseshoe magnet that arched over the strings (as found on the Rickenbacker A-22 \\"Frying Pan\\"), or a static coil through which a magnet passed, the magnet being vibrated by the guitar's bridge (a design used by former Gibson employee Lloyd Loar on his Vivi-Tone guitar). The Charlie Christian pickup consists of a coil of copper wire wound around a black plastic bobbin. The coil has a rectangular hole in its center, and the coil and bobbin fit around a chrome-plated steel blade polepiece. Attached at right angles to the bottom of the polepiece are a pair of five-inch-long (13 cm) steel bar magnets, which remain out of sight inside the instrument. These magnets are secured to the top of the ES-150 by the three bolts visible on the guitar's top. Gibson made three varieties of the Charlie Christian pickup, all distinguished by the polepiece: # The first, produced from 1936 until mid-1938, had a plain blade polepiece. The coil was wound to about 2.4 kŒ© resistance using AWG 38 enameled wire. # The second type, introduced on ES-150s from mid-1938 onward, had a polepiece with a notch cut out below the second (B) string. This modification lowered the B string's volume, which previously sounded louder than the other strings. This pickup's coil was wound with more turns of a finer wire (AWG 42), producing approximately 5.2 kŒ© resistance and higher output. # The third pickup was available on the Gibson ES-250, beginning in 1939. The blade on this pickup had five notches, one in each string space. This pickup had a more compact internal design, with a cobalt steel slug that was small enough to sit directly under the pickup. =Sound= Charlie Christian pickups produce a clear sound because of their narrow string-sensing blade‚Äîand a strong signal because of their relatively high coil impedance. Uneven magnetic flux within the steel magnets can cause some distortion in the signal. These pickups are relatively sensitive to electromagnetic hum because of their large surface area and lack of shielding.

Southampton University, UK. Version H.07.09.03. It is owned by the Welds, a family who own in Dorset in the name of the Lulworth Estate. It is open to the public.  Geology  The form of the coastline around Durdle Door is controlled by its geology‚Äîboth by the contrasting hardnesses of the rocks, and by the local patterns of faults and folds.Nowell, D. A. G. \\"The geology of Lulworth Cove, Dorset.\\" Geology Today 14 (1998): 71‚Äì74. The arch has formed on a concordant coastline where bands of rock run parallel to the shoreline. The rock strata are almost vertical, and the bands of rock are quite narrow. Originally a band of resistant Portland limestone ran along the shore, the same band that appears one mile along the coast forming the narrow entrance to Lulworth Cove. Behind this is a band of weaker, easily eroded rocks, and behind this is a stronger and much thicker band of chalk, which forms the Purbeck Hills. These steeply dipping rocks are part of the Lulworth crumple, itself part of the broader Purbeck Monocline, produced by the building of the Alps during the mid-Cenozoic. A 'back view' of the Durdle Door promontory from the east, showing the remnants of the more resistant strata in Man O'War Bay The limestone and chalk are in closer proximity at Durdle Door than at Swanage, to the east, where the distance is over .Arkell, W. J., 1947. The geology of the country around Weymouth, Swanage, Corfe and Lulworth. Mem. geol. Surv. UK Around this part of the coast nearly all of the limestone has been removed by sea erosion, whilst the remainder forms the small headland which includes the arch. Erosion at the western end of the limestone band has resulted in the arch formation. UNESCO teams monitor the condition of both the arch and adjacent beach. The isthmus that joins the limestone to the chalk is made of a band of Portland limestone, a narrow and compressed band of Cretaceous Wealden clays and sands, and then narrow bands of greensand and sandstone. In Man O' War Bay, the small bay immediately east of Durdle Door, the band of Portland and Purbeck limestone has not been entirely eroded away, and is visible above the waves as Man O'War Rocks. Similarly, offshore to the west, the eroded limestone outcrop forms a line of small rocky islets called (from east to west) The Bull, The Blind Cow, The Cow, and The Calf. As the coastline in this area is generally an eroding landscape, the cliffs are subject to occasional rockfalls and landslides; a particularly large slide occurred just to the east of Durdle Door in April 2013, resulting in destruction of part of the South West Coast Path.  Etymology  There is a dearth of early written records about the arch, though it has kept a name given to it probably over a thousand years ago. In the late 18th century there is a description of the \\"magnificent arch of Durdle-rock Door\\", and early 19th-century maps called it \\"Duddledoor\\" and \\"Durdle\\" or \\"Dudde Door\\". In 1811 the first Ordnance Survey map of the area named it as \\"Dirdale Door\\". Durdle is derived from the Old English , meaning to pierce, bore or drill, which in turn derives from , meaning hole. Similar names in the region include Durlston Bay and Durlston Head further east, where a coastal stack suggests the existence of an earlier arch, and the Thurlestone, an arched rock in the neighbouring county of Devon to the west. The Door part of the name probably maintains its modern meaning, referring to the arched shape of the rock; in the late 19th century there is reference to it being called the \\"Barn-door\\", and it is described as being \\"sufficiently high for a good-sized sailing boat to pass through it.\\" People on the beach show the scale of the arch. The Isle of Portland can be seen on the horizon.  In literature and popular culture  Music videos have been filmed at Durdle Door, including parts of Tears for Fears' \\"Shout\\", Billy Ocean's \\"Loverboy\\", Cliff Richard's \\"Saviour's Day\\" and Bruce Dickinson's \\"Tears of the Dragon\\". The landscape around Durdle Door has been used in scenes in several films, including Wilde (1997) starring Stephen Fry, Nanny McPhee starring Emma Thompson, the 1967 production of Far From The Madding Crowd (the latter also filmed around nearby Scratchy Bottom), and the Bollywood film Housefull 3. Ron Dawson's children's story Scary Bones meets the Dinosaurs of the Jurassic Coast creates a myth of how Durdle Door came to be, as an 'undiscovered' dinosaur called Durdle Doorus is magically transformed into rock. Dorset-born Arthur Moule, a friend of Thomas Hardy and missionary to China, wrote these lines about Durdle Door for his 1879 book of poetry Songs of heaven and home, written in a foreign land:  See also  * Arch of Cabo San Lucas * Delicate Arch and Landscape Arch in the USA * Durdle Pier, Isle of Portland * √âtretat, France * Geology of Dorset * Green Bridge of Wales * Rocher Perc√©, Qu√©bec, Canada * Stair Hole * Swyre Head, Chaldon Down and Bat's Head, to the west * List of Dorset beaches  References   Further reading  * Arkell, W.J., 1978.

It adjoins the ancient woodland of Burnham Beeches, has an area of 2.5 miles and a population of around 6,000. It is in the civil parish of Farnham Royal. History The Church of St John the Evangelist Farnham RoyalBuckinghamshire Federation of Women's Institutes for the publication \\"The Buckinghamshire Village Book\\" (1987) was the main village with its church of St Mary's, shops, cottages and village pump situated in the centre junction of the cross roads. Farnham Common was known as 'Up End', being the common land of the parish where the livestock was grazed at certain times of the year. As this common area became more populated it became known as Farnham Common. Farnham Common is on the border of Burnham Beeches, the well known Beech forest owned by the City of London Corporation, having been given to the people of London as a place in the country for their recreation and pleasure.Map of Burnham Beeches In the 1920s it was very common for coach loads of Londoners to come down for the day at weekends having tea at the tea rooms and enjoying the donkey rides. A few of the large old houses still remain such as Yew Place, Farnham Park (once called The Chase) and Caldicott. Yew Place was formerly known as The Rectory, part of which dates back to the time of King John. The original farmhouse was given to a coachman in the service of the Earl of Warwick. The Chase, now known as Farnham Park, was owned by Mr Carr Gomme, a very influential member of the community, being one of the main organisers of fund-raisers for the building of St John's Church. The house passed into the hands of Sir Gomer Berry, later Lord Kemsley, who had the organ dismantled from Farnham Park and gave it to St John's Church. Farnham Park is now the renowned Farnham Park Rehabilitation Centre presently owned by the East Berkshire Health Authority. Caldicott is a very imposing house situated on the edge of Burnham Beeches and was once owned by Mrs Harvey who gave money for the extension of Farnham Common Village Hall. Caldicott is now a Boys Preparatory School. A few names of note who have been associated with Farnham Common have been the artist Rex Whistler's mother, who lived in The Small House in Burnham Beeches; J. M. Barrie, the author of Peter Pan and Enid Blyton, the children's author. In Burnham Beeches there is a large beech tree under which Felix Mendelssohn used to sit and compose some of his works in 'peaceful splendour'. Joan Hammond, the opera singer, lived in the part of the village known as Egypt. The Moore family live in the village and hold the record of three generations of one family representing Great Britain in the Olympic Games, Major George Moore having competed in 1948, Lieut. Col. John Moore, his son, in 1956, 1960 and 1964 and Lieut. Mark Moore, his grandson, in 1984. Lieut. Col. John Moore received on O.B.E. for his services to skiing. Lois Allan invented Fuzzy Felt in her cottage in the village during World War II.

It was found by Dr. Abram Petkau at the Atomic Energy of Canada Whiteshell Nuclear Research Establishment, Manitoba and published in Health Physics March 1972. The Petkau effect was coined by Swiss nuclear hazards commentator Ralph Graeub in 1985 in this book Der Petkau-Effekt und unsere strahlende Zukunft (The Petkau effect and our Radiating Future). Petkau had been measuring, in the usual way, the radiation dose that would rupture a simulated artificial cell membrane. He found that 3500 rads delivered in hours (26 rad/min = 15.5 Sv/h) would do it. Then, almost by chance, Petkau repeated the experiment with much weaker radiation and found that 0.7 rad delivered in hours (1 millirad/min = 0.61 mSv/h) also ruptured the membrane. This was counter to the prevailing assumption of a linear relationship between total dose or dose rate and the consequences.Djurovic, Branka, MD, PhD, \\"Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation\\", Slide 15, Military Medical Academy, Belgrade, Serbia The radiation was of ionizing nature, and produced negative oxygen ions (free radicals). Those ions were more damaging to the simulated membrane in lower concentrations than higher (a somewhat counter-intuitive result in itself) because in the latter, they more readily recombine with each other instead of interfering with the membrane. The ion concentration directly correlated with the radiation dose rate and the composition had non-monotonic consequences. Radio-protective effects of superoxide dismutase Petkau conducted further experiments with simulated cells in 1976 and found that the enzyme superoxide dismutase protected the cells from free radicals generated by ionizing radiation, obviating the effects seen in his earlier experiment. Petkau also discovered that superoxide dismutase was elevated in the leukocytes (white blood cells) in a sub-population of nuclear workers occupationally exposed to elevated radiation (ca. 10 mSv in 6 months), further supporting the hypothesis that superoxide dismutase is a radioprotective agent. Thus, Petkau's original 1972 experiment apparently revealed the potential effects of ionizing radiation on cells without natural radioprotective mechanisms in place.

It is a sedentary (non-migratory) species. This is a common bird of dry open country, often at some altitude. Thekla's lark was named by Alfred Edmund Brehm in 1857 for his recently deceased sister Thekla Brehm (1833‚Äì1857). The name is a modern Greek one, ŒòŒ≠Œ∫ŒªŒ± (Thekla), which comes from ancient Greek ŒòŒµœåŒ∫ŒªŒµŒπŒ± (Theokleia) derived from Œ∏ŒµœåœÇ (theos, \\"god\\") and Œ∫ŒªŒ≠ŒøœÇ (kleos, \\"glory\\" or \\"honour\\").Thekla.

It has a long, spiky, erectile crest. It is greyer than the Eurasian skylark, and lacks the white wing and tail edge of that species. It is very similar to the widespread crested lark. It is smaller and somewhat greyer than that species, and has a shorter bill. In flight it shows grey underwings, whereas the crested lark has reddish underwings. The body is mainly dark-streaked grey above and whitish below. The sexes are similar. Distribution and habitat Thekla's lark is native and resident in France, Spain, Portugal, Algeria, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Libya, Morocco, Somalia, Tunisia and Western Sahara. Its typical habitat is rugged areas with scrub, bare patches of ground and semi-arid grassland. Behaviour and ecology Eggs of Galerida theklae MHNT It nests on the ground, laying two to six eggs. Its food is weed, seeds and insects, the latter especially in the breeding season. The song is melodious and varied, with mournful whistles and mimicry included. It is softer and more tuneful than that of the crested lark, and may be sung during flight or from the ground or an exposed perch.

The term cum shot is usually applied to depictions occurring in pornographic films, photographs, and magazines. Cum shots have become the object of fetish genres like bukkake. Facial cum shots (or \\"facials\\") are currently regularly portrayed in pornographic films and videos, often as a way to close a scene.Violet Blue, (Sep 2001) A First Timer‚Äôs Guide to Watching Porn, \\"Facial ejaculation (men ejaculating on women‚Äôs faces) is pretty much a standard.\\" Cum shots may also depict ejaculation onto another performer's body, such as on the genitals, buttocks, chest or tongue. The term is typically used by the cinematographer within the narrative framework of a pornographic film, and, since the 1970s, it has become a leitmotif of the hardcore genre. Two exceptions are softcore pornography, in which penetration is not explicitly shown, and \\"couples erotica\\", which may involve penetration but is typically filmed in a more discreet manner intended to be romantic or educational rather than graphic. Softcore pornography that does not contain ejaculation sequences is produced both to respond to a demand by some consumers for less-explicit pornographic material and to comply with government regulations or cable company rules that may disallow depictions of ejaculation. Cum shots typically do not appear in \\"girl-girl\\" scenes (female ejaculation scenes exist, but are relatively rare); orgasm is instead implied by utterances, cinematic conventions, or body movement. Terminology A cum shot may also be called a cumshot, come shot, cum blast, pop shot or money shot. Originally, in general film-making usage the term money shot was a reference to the scene that cost the most money to produce;Jane Mills, The Money Shot: Cinema, Sin and Censorship. Pluto Press, Annandale 2001. , p. xix; Extract in addition, the inclusion of this expensive special effect sequence is being counted on to become a selling point for the film. For example, in an action thriller, an expensive special effects sequence of a dam bursting might be called the \\"money shot\\" of the film. The use of money shot to denote the ejaculation scene in pornographic films is attributed to producers paying the male actors extra for it. The meaning of the term money shot has sometimes been borrowed back from pornography by the film and TV industry with a meaning closer to that used in pornographic films. For example, in TV talk shows, the term, borrowed from pornography, denotes a highly emotional scene, expressed in visible bodily terms. Origin and features Ejaculation onto a woman's chest after mammary intercourse Although earlier pornographic films occasionally contained footage of ejaculation, it was not until the advent of hard-core pornography in the 1970s that the stereotypical cum shot scene became a standard feature‚Äîdisplaying ejaculation with maximum visibility. The 1972 film Behind the Green Door featured a seven-minute-long sequence described by Linda Williams, professor of film studies, as \\"optically printed, psychedelically colored doublings of the ejaculating penis\\". Steven Ziplow's The Film Maker's Guide to Pornography (1977) states: Cum shot scenes may involve the female actor calling for the shot to be directed at some specific part of her body. Cultural analysis researcher Murat Aydemir considers this one of the three quintessential aspects of the cum shot scene, alongside the emphasis on visible ejaculation and the timing of the cum shot, which usually concludes a hard-core scene. As a possible alternative explanation for the rise of the cum shot in hardcore pornography, Joseph Slade, professor at Ohio University and author of Pornography and sexual representation: a reference guide notes that pornography actresses in the 1960s and 1970s did not trust birth control methods, and that more than one actress of the period told him that ejaculation inside her body was deemed inconsiderate if not rude. Health risks =Transmission of disease= Any sexual activity that involves contact with the bodily fluids of another person contains the risk of transmission of sexually transmitted diseases. Semen is in itself generally harmless on the skin or if swallowed. However, semen can be the vehicle for many sexually transmitted infections, such as HIV and hepatitis. The California Occupational Safety and Health Administration categorizes semen as \\"other potentially infectious material\\" or OPIM. Aside from other sexual activity that may have occurred prior to performing a facial, the risks incurred by the giving and receiving partner are drastically different. For the ejaculating partner, there is almost no risk of contracting an STD. For the receiving partner, the risk is higher. Since potentially infected semen could come into contact with broken skin or sensitive mucous membranes (eyes, lips, mouth), there is a risk of contracting an infectious disease. =Allergic reactions= In rare cases, people have been known to experience allergic reactions to seminal fluids, known as human seminal plasma hypersensitivity. Symptoms can be either localized or systemic, and may include itching, redness, swelling, or blisters within 30 minutes of contact. They may also include hives and even difficulty breathing. Options for prevention of semen allergy include avoiding exposure to seminal fluid by use of condoms and attempting desensitization. Treatment options include diphenhydramine and/or an injection of epinephrine. Criticisms and responses A critic of \\"cum shot\\" scenes in heterosexual pornography is the US porn star-turned writer, director and producer Candida Royalle. She produced pornography films aimed at women and their partners that avoid the \\"misogynous predictability\\" and depiction of sex in \\"...as grotesque and graphic [a way] as possible.\\" Royalle also criticizes the male-centredness of the typical pornography film, in which scenes end when the male actor ejaculates.\\"Girls on top\\" by Lilly Bragge, The Age, June 16, 2004. Women's activist Beatrice Faust argued, \\"since ejaculating into blank space is not much fun, ejaculating over a person who responds with enjoyment sustains a lighthearted mood as well as a degree of realism. This occurs in both homosexual and pornography so that ejaculation cannot be interpreted as an expression of contempt for women only.\\" She goes on to say \\"Logically, if sex is natural and wholesome and semen is as healthy as sweat, there is no reason to interpret ejaculation as a hostile gesture.\\" Sexologist Peter S√°ndor Gardos argues that his research suggests that \\"... the men who get most turned on by watching cum shots are the ones who have positive attitudes toward women\\" (at the annual meeting of the Society for the Scientific Study of Sex in 1992).Bruce Herschensohn; Bill Clinton; Sexologists in San Diego; Future Sex 2 by Bruce Herschensohn. Later, at the World Pornography Conference in 1998, he reported a similar conclusion, namely that \\"no pornographic image is interpretable outside of its historical and social context. Harm or degradation does not reside in the image itself.\\" Cindy Patton, activist and scholar on human sexuality, argues that, in western culture, male sexual fulfillment is synonymous with orgasm and that the male orgasm is an essential punctuation of the sexual narrative. No orgasm, no sexual pleasure. No cum shot, no narrative closure. The cum shot is the period at the end of the sentence. In her essay \\"Visualizing Safe Sex: When Pedagogy and Pornography Collide\\", Patton reached the conclusion that critics have devoted too little space to discovering the meaning that viewers attach to specific acts such as cum shots.

It has a population of 16,000. It was listed in the Domesday Book as Cainesham (as it is pronounced), which is believed to mean the home of Saint Keyne. The site of the town has been occupied since prehistoric times, and may have been the site of the Roman settlement of Trajectus. The remains of at least two Roman villas have been excavated, and an additional 15 Roman buildings have been detected beneath the Keynsham Hams. Keynsham developed into a medieval market town after Keynsham Abbey was founded around 1170. It is situated at the confluence of the River Chew and River Avon and was subject to serious flooding before the creation of Chew Valley Lake and river level controls at Keynsham Lock in 1727. The Chew Stoke flood of 1968 inundated large parts of the town. It was home to the Cadbury's chocolate factory, Somerdale, which opened in 1935 as a major employer in the town. It is home to Memorial Park, which is used for the annual town festival and several nature reserves. The town is served by Keynsham railway station on the London-Bristol and Bristol-Southampton trunk routes and is close to the A4 road which bypassed the town in 1964. There are schools, religious, sporting, and cultural clubs and venues. History =Roman Trajectus= Keynsham Cemetery at Durley Hill, which is built over the remains of the grand Roman villa Evidence of occupation dates back to prehistoric times, and during the Roman period, Keynsham may have been the site of the Roman settlement of Trajectus, which is the Latin word for \\"bridgehead.\\" It is believed that a settlement around a Roman ford over the River Avon existed somewhere in the vicinity, and the numerous Roman ruins discovered in Keynsham make it a likely candidate for this lost settlement. In 1877 during construction of the Durley Hill Cemetery, the remains of a grand Roman villa with over 30 rooms was discovered. However, construction of the cemetery went ahead, and the majority of the villa is now located beneath the Victorian cemetery and an adjacent road. The cemetery was expanded in 1922, and an archeological dig was carried out ahead of the interments, leading to the excavation of 17 rooms and the rescue of 10 elaborate mosaics. At the same time as the grand Roman villa was being excavated at Durley Hill Cemetery, a second smaller villa was discovered during the construction of Fry's Somerdale Chocolate Factory. Two fine stone coffins were found, interred with the remains of a man and a woman. The villa and coffins were removed to a place near the gates of the factory grounds, and construction on the factory went ahead. Fry's built in the grounds of the factory a museum which for many years housed the Durley Hill mosaics, the coffins, and numerous other artefacts. In 2012, Taylor Wimpey, about to develop the factory site, made a detailed geophysical assessment of the area, and discovered an additional 15 Roman buildings centered around a Roman road beneath Keynsham Hams, with evidence of additional Roman buildings that had been disturbed by quarrying. =Medieval Keynsham= According to legend, Saint Keyne, daughter of King Brychan of Brycheiniog (Brecon), lived here on the banks of the River Avon during the 5th century. Before settling here, she had been warned by the local King that the marshy area was swarming with snakes, which prevented habitation. St Keyne prayed to the heavens and turned the snakes to stone. The fossil ammonites found in the area were believed to be the result. However, there is no evidence that her cult was ever celebrated in Keynsham. Some scattered archeological evidence suggests that an Anglo- Saxon settlement existed in Keynsham in the High Street area, and that in the 9th century a Minster church existed in Keynsham as well. The earliest documentary reference to Keynsham is in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, (c. 980) which refers to it as C√¶gineshamme, Old English for 'C√¶ga's Hamm.' The town is also listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 as \\"Cainesham.\\" It has therefore been suggested that the origin of Keynsham's name is not, in fact Saint Keyne, but from \\"Ceagin (Caega).\\" Around 1170, Keynsham Abbey was founded by the Victorine congregation of canon regulars. Archeological evidence suggests that the abbey was built over the site of the previous Saxon Minster church. The settlement developed into a medieval market town, and the abbey of Keynsham was given ownership of the Keynsham Hundred. The Abbey survived until the dissolution of the monasteries in 1539, and a house was subsequently built on the site. The remains have been designated as a Grade I listed building by English Heritage. =Modern history= Keynsham played a part in the Civil War as the Roundheads saved the town and also camped there for the night, using the pub now known as the Lock Keeper Inn as a guard post. During the Monmouth Rebellion of 1685 the town was the site of a battle between royalist forces and the rebel Duke of Monmouth. Bridges Almshouses were built around 1685 and may have been for the widows of those killed in the rebellion. =Post World War II= 1960s Keynsham Clock Tower, removed in 2010s regeneration Before the creation of Chew Valley Lake and river level controls at Keynsham Lock and weir, Keynsham was prone to flooding. The Great Flood of 1968 inundated large parts of the town, destroying the town's bridges including the county bridge over the Avon which had stood since medieval times, and private premises on Dapps Hill; the devastation was viewed by the Duke of Edinburgh. After the flood the Memorial Park, which had been laid out after World War II was extended. Keynsham rose to fame during the late 1950s and early 1960s when it featured in a long-running series of advertisements on Radio Luxembourg for Horace Batchelor's Infra-draw betting system. To obtain the system, listeners had to write to Batchelor's Keynsham post office box, and Keynsham was always painstakingly spelled out on-air, with Batchelor famously intoning \\"Keynsham ‚Äì spelt K-E-Y-N-S-H-A-M ‚Äì Keynsham, Bristol\\". This was done because the proper pronunciation of Keynsham ‚Äì \\"Cane-sham\\" ‚Äì does not make the spelling of Keynsham immediately obvious to the radio listener. Since the 1950s Keynsham has become a dormitory town for Bristol and Bath. The High Street shopping area has been remodelled, and a Town Hall, Library, and Clock Tower were built in the mid-1960s. =2010s regeneration= Design work for regeneration of the town hall area was awarded by Bath and North East Somerset Council to Aedas in 2010, with the works cost stated in 2011 to be ( in 2012). Realisation of the plans is hoped to \\"attract new business and jobs\\", in the aftermath of the announcement of the Cadbury Somerdale Factory closure. In January 2012, it was announced that the Willmott Dixon Group had been appointed as contractor on the scheme. The Council's planning committee in August 2012 deferred the approval decision, pending alterations to the external appearance of the building. These were approved in October 2012, with demolition commencing in the same month. The regenerated Civic Centre area came back into use in late 2014 and early 2015. Governance Council Offices The town council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council‚Äôs operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The town council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The town council's role includes projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, such as the village hall or community centre, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Playing fields and playgrounds are provided in Memorial Park, Downfield, Kelston Road, Teviot Road, Holmoak Road and Manor Road with basketball facilities at Teviot Road and Holmoak Road and a BMX track at Keynsham Road. The Keynsham town council is also responsible for the football pitches and pavilion at Manor Road and the floodlit Multi Sport Site in Memorial Park. It also provides support for community groups organising music and cultural events. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also of interest to the council. The town council was formed in 1991 and consists of 15 members elected every four years. There are 2 Labour and 13 Conservative. Keynsham has one official twin town: Libourne in France. Keynsham Fire Station From 1974 to 1996, Keynsham was administered as part of the short-lived county of Avon; it has since formed part of the unitary authority of Bath and North East Somerset, in the ceremonial county of Somerset. Bath and North East Somerset which was created in 1996, was established by the Local Government Act 1992. The town is divided into Keynhsam North, which has five Conservative councillors, Keynsham South which is represented by three Conservative and two Labour councillors, and Keynsham East, which has the remaining 5 councillors, all of whom are Conservatives. Bath and North East Somerset provides a single tier of local government with responsibility for almost all local government functions within its area including local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection, recycling, cemeteries, crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. It is also responsible for education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning, although fire, police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the Avon Fire and Rescue Service, Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the Great Western Ambulance Service. Bath and North East Somerset's area covers part of the ceremonial county of Somerset but it is administered independently of the non-metropolitan county. Its administrative headquarters is in Bath, but many departments are headquartered in Keynsham. Between 1 April 1974 and 1 April 1996, it was the main town of the Wansdyke district of the county of Avon. Before 1974 that the parish was part of the Keynsham Urban District. The parish is represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom as part of the North East Somerset constituency, which is a county constituency created by the Boundary Commission for England as the successor seat to the Wansdyke Parliamentary Seat. It came into being at the 2010 general election, and is represented by the Conservative Jacob Rees-Mogg. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. Geography The Lock Keeper pub on the River Avon Keynsham is located where the River Chew meets the River Avon. Fishing rights for the Millground and Chewton sections of the Chew are owned by Keynsham Angling Club. The Mill Ground stretch of the River Chew consists of the six fields on the western bank from Chewton Place at Chewton Keynsham to the Albert Mill. The water is home to chub, roach, European perch and rudd, along with good numbers of gudgeon, dace and trout. Keynsham Lock on the Avon opened in 1727. Just above the lock are some visitor moorings and a pub, on an island between the lock and the weir. The weir side of the island is also the mouth of the River Chew. An aerial view of Keynsham. Memorial Park, the northern part of which has existed as parkland since the 19th century, as shown by the ordnance Survey maps of 1864 and 1867, was formally laid out after World War II was extended after the floods of 1968. It covers of woodland and grass alongside the River Chew. It commemorates the war dead of Keynsham and includes facilities including two children's play areas, a skateboard park, multi-sport area, bowling green, public toilets, a bandstand and refreshment kiosk. The formal gardens within the park are adjacent to the River Chew with the Dapps Hill Woods at its western end. Part of the park is known locally as Chew Park because of its proximity to the river and another area, close to Keynsham Abbey as Abbey Park. The park received the Green Flag Award in 2008/09, and again for 2009/10. Albert Mill on the River Chew On the outskirts of Keynsham lies Keynsham Humpy Tumps, one of the most floristically rich acidic grassland sites within the Avon area. The site is on a south- facing slope running alongside the Bristol to Bath railway line. It consists of open patches of grassland and bare rock, interspersed with blocks of scrub. It is the only site in Avon at which upright chickweed Moenchia erecta, occurs. Other locally notable plant species found here include annual knawel Scleranthus annuus, sand spurrey Spergularia rubra, subterranean clover Trifolium subterraneus and prickly sedge Carex muricata ssp. lamprocarpa. The site does not have any statutory conservation status, and is not managed for its biodiversity interest. Threats to its ecological value include the encroachment of scrub onto the grassland areas, and damage from motorcycle scrambling. Between Keynsham and Saltford, a area of green belt has been planted, with over 19,000 trees, as the Manor Road Community Woodland, which has been designated as a Nature Reserve. Nearby is the Avon Valley Country Park tourist attraction. Along with the rest of South West England, Keynsham has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of England. The annual mean temperature is about 10 ¬∞C (50 ¬∞F) with seasonal and diurnal variations, but due to the modifying effect of the sea, the range is less than in most other parts of the United Kingdom. January is the coldest month with mean minimum temperatures between 1 ¬∞C (34 ¬∞F) and 2 ¬∞C (36 ¬∞F). July and August are the warmest months in the region with mean daily maxima around 21 ¬∞C (70 ¬∞F). In general, December is the dullest month and June the sunniest. The south west of England enjoys a favoured location, particularly in summer, when the Azores High extends its influence north-eastwards towards the UK. Cloud often forms inland, especially near hills, and reduces exposure to sunshine. The average annual sunshine totals around 1600 hours. Rainfall tends to be associated with Atlantic depressions or with convection. In summer, convection caused by solar surface heating sometimes forms shower clouds and a large proportion of the annual precipitation falls from showers and thunderstorms at this time of year. Average rainfall is around 800‚Äì900 mm (31‚Äì35 in). About 8‚Äì15 days of snowfall is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, with June to August having the lightest. The predominant wind direction is from the south west. Demography Keynsham Health Centre In the 2001 census Keynsham had a population of 15,533, in 6,545 households, of which 6,480 described themselves as White. Keynsham East Ward had a population of 5,479, Keynsham North 5,035 and Keynsham South 5,019. In each of the wards between 75 and 80% of the population described themselves as Christians, and around 15% said that they had no religion. In 1881 the population of the civil parish was 2,482. This grew gradually until 1931 when there were 4,521, before there was a steeper rise to 1951 when there were 8,277. Over the next ten years this nearly doubled to 15,152 in 1961. Economy The Somerdale Factory from front lawns An important industry in the town was Cadbury's chocolate factory, the Somerdale Factory. The J. S. Fry & Sons business merged with Cadbury in 1919, and moved their factory in the centre of Bristol to Keynsham in 1935. As Quakers, Cadbury's built the factory on a greenfield site with social facilities, including playing fields and recreational sports grounds. Called Somerdale after a national competition in 1923, Keynsham Cadbury was the home of Fry's Chocolate Cream, the Double Decker, Dairy Milk and Mini Eggs, Cadbury's Fudge, Chomp and Crunchie. On 3 October 2007, Cadbury announced plans to close the Somerdale plant by 2010 with the loss of some 500 jobs. Production was to be moved to factories in Birmingham and Poland, and in the longer term it was expected that the site would be redeveloped for housing. Labour MP for Wansdyke, Dan Norris, said \\"news of the factory's closure is a hard and heavy blow, not just to the workforce, but to the Keynsham community as a whole\\". By late 2007 campaigns to save the Cadbury's factory in Somerdale were in full swing, and one local resident started a campaign to urge English Heritage to protect the site and preserve the history of the factory. In 2009 the US corporation Kraft made a takeover bid for Cadbury Schweppes. Cadbury's were seen as iconic of British manufacturing industry, and the bid became a cause c√©l√®bre of national interest. To sweeten their case before the Monopolies Commission, Kraft made a pledge to keep the Cadbury factory at Somerdale open if they were successful in their bid for the company; and their bid was duly successful. However, within a week of completing their purchase of Cadbury, Kraft CEO Irene Rosenfeld released a statement announcing that Kraft were to close the factory by 2011, as originally planned by Cadbury. The stated reason for this was that it was only after the purchase had been made that Kraft realised how advanced Cadbury's plans were, but industry experts questioned this, arguing that Kraft invested so much in researching their bid for Cadbury that they should have been aware of the extent to which plans had been advanced. Culture In 1969 the town was featured as the title of the fourth album Keynsham by the Bonzo Dog Band. The title was chosen in honour of Horace Batchelor, who had been referenced in previous Bonzo Dog Band recordings. In the early 1960s, Batchelor became known through his regular advertisements on Radio Luxembourg for his football pools prediction service. When giving his contact address, he would slowly spell out 'Keynsham' letter by letter, and this became an amusing feature for many young listeners. Keynsham Festival, which started in the late 1990s, takes place in the Memorial Park each July, and attracts around 16,000 people. There is also a Victorian evening held in the town each November. Keynsham and Saltford local history society was formed in 1965 and is concerned with researching and recording the history of the area. Keynsham was chosen as the outdoor location for a dramatic story-line in the BBC One TV serial EastEnders in September 2012 with filming taking place in a cordoned- off section of the High Street. In Northanger Abbey by Jane Austen, Catherine and her friends ride to ‚Ä≥within view of the town of Keynsham‚Ä≥. Transport Keynsham A4 Bypass The town is served by Keynsham railway station on the London-Bristol and Bristol-Southampton trunk routes. It opened in 1840 and was renamed Keynsham and Somerdale in 1925. The chocolate factory had its own rail system which was connected to the main line, but the connection was taken out of use 26‚Äì27 July 1980. The station's name reverted to Keynsham on 6 May 1974. The station was rebuilt in 1985 as a joint project between British Rail and Avon County Council. The A4 trunk road used to run through the town, but much of this traffic is now carried on the bypass, which was constructed in 1964. The bypass runs from Saltford, a village which adjoins Keynsham, to Brislington in Bristol. Keynsham is about 10 miles (16 km) from junction 1 of the M32 via the Avon Ring Road A4174 and provides a fast route to the M4 and M5. Keynsham is on the Monarch's Way long distance footpath which approximates the escape route taken by King Charles II in 1651 after being defeated in the Battle of Worcester. In May 2017, the High Street was made one-way for traffic heading towards Saltford and Bath with all Bristol-bound diverted along Ashton Way. There is now no access to Temple Street from High Street with the exception of buses and taxis, all traffic for Temple Street is diverted along Ashton Way. The town is served by 6 bus routes, 1 of which connects Bath with Bristol International Airport, another bus service runs from Ashton Way at the back of the shops to Southmead Hospital and one bus service runs to Cribbs Causeway. In numerical order: * A4 Bath to Bristol Airport * 17 Keynsham to Southmead Hospital * 18 Bath to Cribbs Causeway * 39 Bath to Bristol * 178 Radstock to Bristol * 349 Keynsham to Bristol All buses towards Bristol, Southmead and Cribbs Causeway use the bus stop on Ashton Way at the back of the shops, whilst all buses towards Bath use the stop on the High Street opposite the Post Office. Education State-funded schools are organised within the unitary authority of Bath and North East Somerset. A review of Secondary Education in Bath was started in 2007, primarily to reduce surplus provision and reduce the number of single-sex secondary schools in Bath, and to access capital funds available through the government's Building Schools for the Future programme. There are four primary schools in Keynsham, St John‚Äôs Primary School, Castle Primary School, Chandag (Infants and Junior schools) and St Keyna Primary School (formed when Keynsham Primary School and 150 year old Temple Primary School merged in 2007). There are also three secondary schools: Wellsway; Broadlands; and IKB Academy. Broadlands School Wellsway School is an 11‚Äì18, mixed comprehensive school which was established in 1971, by amalgamating Keynsham Grammar School and Wellsway County Secondary School both of which opened on a shared site in the mid-1950s. Most students that attend the school live in Keynsham and Saltford or the nearby villages. As of 2014, approximately 1335 students attend the school, ranging in age of 11‚Äì18, with 64% achieving 5 or more A-C grades at GCSE. Wellsway's bid for specialist school status was accepted in September 2007. Meaning that Wellsway School now specialises as a Sports and Science College. This means the School has joined the national network of specialist schools, resulting in every school in Bath and North East Somerset now having a specialism. A joint bid is unusual as there are only six schools in the country with a combined Sports and Science specialism. Broadlands Academy became an academy in 2012. It has 430 students between the ages of 11 and 16 years. IKB Academy opened in September 2015, and has a focus on Science, Technology, Engineering, and Maths (STEM) subjects. It is a studio school for pupils aged 14‚Äì19, and offers GCSEs, A Levels, and BTECs, in conjunction with weekly or fortnightly work placements. Nearby Bath has two universities. The University of Bath was established in 1966. It is known, academically, for the physical sciences, mathematics, architecture, management and technology. Bath Spa University was first granted degree-awarding powers in 1992 as a university college (Bath Spa University College), before being granted university status in August 2005. It has schools in Art and Design, Education, English and Creative Studies, Historical and Cultural Studies, Music and the Performing Arts, and Social Sciences. The city contains one further education college, City of Bath College, and several sixth forms as part of both state, private, and public schools. In England, on average in 2006, 45.8% of pupils gained 5 grades A-C including English and Maths; for Bath and North East Somerset pupils taking GCSE at 16 it is 52.0%. Special needs education is provided by Three Ways School. Religious sites Church of St John the Baptist, Keynsham Begun in 1292, the Church of England parish church of St John the Baptist, Keynsham gradually evolved until taking its present general form during the reign of Charles II, after the tower collapsed into the building during a storm in 1632. The tower, built over the north-east corner of the nave, now rises in three stages over the Western entrance and is surmounted by a pierced parapet and short croketted pinnacles and is said to have been built from the ruins of the abbey church. The south aisle and south porch date from 1390. The chancel, then the responsibility of the abbey, was rebuilt in 1470 and further restoration was carried out in 1634‚Äì1655, following the collapse of the tower. There is a pulpit dating from 1634 and is also a screen of the same age which shuts off the choir vestry. It has been designated as a Grade II* listed building. A former organ is said to have stood in the church, but \\"had tones so mellow\\" that Handel bargained for it, offering a peal of bells in exchange. The offer was accepted. The musician went off with the organ and the bells were delivered.

Taxonomy and systematics Originally, the Malabar lark was classified in the genus Alauda before being moved to its present genus. Also, some authorities have considered the Thekla lark to be a subspecies of the Malabar lark. Description left This is a smallish lark, slightly smaller than the Eurasian skylark. It has a long spiky erectile crest. It is greyer than the skylark, and lacks the white wing and tail edges of that species, which is a winter visitor to India. It is very similar to the crested lark, which breeds in northern India. The Malabar lark is smaller and dark-streaked reddish brown in plumage, whereas the crested lark is grey. The belly is white. The sexes are similar. Sykes's lark is another Indian relative that also has reddish- brown plumage, but is smaller, shorter-billed, with a stiff upright crest and has plain rufous underparts. Distribution and habitat The Malabar lark is found in western India. It is a common bird of open country, cultivation and scrub, often at some altitude. Behaviour and ecology The Malabar lark is a sedentary breeding bird that nests on the ground, laying two or three eggs. Its food is seeds and insects, the latter especially in the breeding season.

Linguswamy starring Madhavan and Meera Jasmine in the lead roles. The film also features Vivek, Sunil,Atul Kulkarni, Raghuvaran and Anu Hasan in supporting roles, while Vidyasagar composed the film's music. The film won positive reviews from critics and Blockbuster at the box office, prompting the film to be partially and major portions simultaneously shot in Telugu and remade in Hindi under the same name by the cinematographer, Jeeva. Plot Siva (Madhavan) is based out of Srirangam and he comes to Chennai to join a college. He stays with his sister (Anu Hasan) and her husband (Raghuvaran). Siva does not like his brother-in-law and never talks to him, despite several attempts made by his sister to convince both. Siva meets Priya (Meera Jasmine) during a bus journey, and it is love at first sight for him. He again meets her on a few more occasions and proposes his love, but she warns him to stop following her despite liking him. Siva understands that Priya's brother Bhaskar (Atul Kulkarni) is a local goon, and he attacks anyone who follows his sister. Priya does not want Siva to get beaten by her brother and advises him to stop following her. But Siva is not scared of this and one day, Bhaskar's hit men spot Siva and Priya together. They try to attack Siva, but instead, Siva beats them up, which gives the courage to Priya to love him as he is capable of fighting her brother. Siva's brother-in-law gets to know about the love story and offers help which makes them both talk. Siva's sister feels happy that her husband and brother are in good terms now with each other. One day, Bhaskar comes to attack Siva's sister's family, but in the meantime, Siva threatens to attack Bhaskar's family, thereby frightening him. Priya decides to elope with Siva. Bhaskar chases them along with his men. The couple is tracked down, and the goons start attacking Siva. Now Priya interferes and challenges her brother to attack Siva single-handedly without any of his hit men. He accepts and starts attacking Siva. But Siva retaliates and hits back Bhaskar, who gets severely injured. He takes a sword and puts it next to him, but rather than killing him, he spares him because he is Priya's brother. Bhaskar accepts his defeat and lets his sister go with Siva. The movie ends with Siva and Priya uniting.

Madhavan had wanted to do an action film after being instructed by director Mani Ratnam to move away from romantic drama films and lost eight kilograms to portray Run's lead role. Vidya Balan was originally selected to play the lead role in the film, but was later released from her contract. The makers then signed on Raima Sen to portray the lead role, before deciding to change the lead actress again after the actress struggled with the Tamil dialogues. But Meera Jasmine was consequently signed on to make her first appearance in Tamil films. Atul Kulkarni was signed on to play an antagonist in the film, and marked a rare move for the actor towards regular villain roles. Raghuvaran, Anu Hasan and Vivek were also signed on to work on the film, with the latter filming a separate comedy track. The scenes were shot at locations in Chennai, Karaikudi, and Srirangam, among other places, while the songs were shot abroad in Denmark and Switzerland. The team also filmed scenes at the M.G. R. Film City, Chennai, where action sequences were filmed. The film completed production in one schedule, with Madhavan remarking about the well organised structure of the shoot. Release The film's release was postponed from July 2002 to September 2002 to finish off post-production works. However the commercial failure of Rajinikanth-starrer Baba (2002) means that the makers pre-poned the film to the earliest release date in September, in order to avoid other competition. The makers of the film chose to release the film on a Thursday instead of a Friday, in order to avoid a box office clash with Prabhu Solomon's Vikram-starrer, King (2002). The film opened in September 2002 to critical acclaim and also performed well at the box office. Nowrunning.com wrote \\"director Linguswami has given a very enjoyable film with good music by Vidyasagar and brilliant cinematography by Jeeva\\", adding \\"Madhavan has proved in this film that he can also do action and that too convincingly\\". Another critic noted \\"there is nothing new about the film's story but, Madhavan's new incarnation as an action hero and Linguswamy's racy screenplay has made this a thoroughly enjoyable experience\\". The film went on to become amongst the highest grossing Tamil films of the year in 2002, and became actor Madhavan's most profitable film at the time of release. Vivek also won the Best Comedian Award at the Filmfare Awards 2002 for his performance in the film. The film was later dubbed and released in Telugu under the same name during April 2003, with the comedy portions re-shot with Telugu actors. The film's cinematographer, Jeeva, later remade the film in Hindi with Abhishek Bachchan, Bhumika Chawla and Vijay Raaz in the leading roles. The film completed 150 day run at some theaters. Music The music was composed by Vidyasagar, with lyrics written by Na. Muthukumar, Pa. Vijay, Thamarai, Yugabharathi, Arivumathi and Viveka. The soundtrack won critical acclaim and became Vidyasagar's most successful album at the time of the release. In popular culture A film titled Kadhal Pisase, named after the song from the film, was released in 2012. A popular scene involving Madhavan closing a subway shutter was later parodied in the spoof film Thamizh Padam (2010), while it was also referred to in Vettai (2012), in which the actor and director had collaborated again.

It is set after a devastating nuclear war. It was first released in the 1980s, and it still has a loyal following. The fourth edition was released as of December 15, 2013 by Chris Garland, the head of Timeline Limited.  History  In 1974, Robert Sadler wrote an outline for a post-apocalyptic adventure story. Richard Tucholka added a second chapter, but then the project was buried for a year or more. In 1975, they were introduced to role playing, and Tucholka suddenly realized that the Morrow Project could be an adventure background for a roleplaying game. He used Sadler's story as a guide to write that game background. Then the two joined forces with Kevin Dockery to flesh out the military portion of the game. After months of playtesting, it was run at an early Michicon and was a great success there. At that point, Timeline Games was born and shortly thereafter, due to internal conflicts, both Richard Tucholka and Robert Sadler left Timeline Games and created Tacky-Tac Games that later became Tri Tac Games. In late 2012 after several years of development a Kickstarter campaign was run to provide the funds to finish the 4th edition of Morrow Project. The Kickstarter campaign easily exceeded its goal and finished successfully on January 3, 2013. The new edition was released on December 15, 2013.  Setting  The game is based around the idea that a group of American industrialists predicted the coming of an apocalyptic nuclear war, and began to create a plan for an emergency operations and reconstruction infrastructure that would survive that war. This plan is the eponymous \\"Morrow Project\\". A number of volunteers were cryonically frozen in hidden bunkers called boltholes. They were provided with substantial caches of supplies and equipment, intended to help the teams rebuild civilization -- once the war had ended, it was thought some places would be identified where the hazards such as nuclear fallout had diminished sufficiently. The plan was for the Morrow Project to be coordinated by a central command post and record- keeping facility called \\"Prime Base.\\" This is an immense self-contained bunker with various annexes, hidden underground in Nevada, in the canyons near Soldier Meadow. Its details are explained in the game book entitled \\"Prime Base.\\" The facility's advanced life support systems and huge variety of other equipment were intended to allow the Project's leaders not to sleep through the war, so as to chronicle it and be in the best position to determine out what should be done next. The Project's \\"Phoenix Team,\\" a highly secret Tier-I special operations unit of approximately platoon strength, was also here, but kept in suspended animation to be used only on the highest authority if there was no alternative. Prime Base was built in isolation according to schedule, but just before it could assume its role it was sabotaged and bombed by a shadowy madman called Krell, sustaining serious damage. The sudden attack wiped out the Morrow Project leaders, but 150 years after the war, the damaged central computer at Prime Base finally began to issue one or more wakeup signals. This revived at least one of the Morrow Project assets -- the team that the player characters are part of. The status of other Teams is purposefully kept unclear, so that details can be worked out by the person coordinating the game, who is called the Project Director. The game therefore centers around the question of whether the Project is hopelessly compromised, or whether its scattered outposts can reconnect and replace the non-functional headquarters. Must they try to confront huge reconstruction tasks alone, when it was expected that thousands of Project members would help them? Do they have the courage to try? = Initial scenario = The initial scenario may be played with nothing other than the game book, dice, paper and pencil. Expansion sets are available introducing further scenarios, weapons and equipment. One hundred and fifty years after the Third World War, the members of the Morrow Project wake to a strange world. Instead of being part of an organized plan to rebuild their civilization, they find themselves isolated in a world where the War is only a distant legend, the people are ignorant of anything but the struggle to survive and strange mutated animals haunt their footsteps. Players of the Morrow Project must not only survive, but must carry out their original mission: to rebuild the world. To do this they have their equipment and training, their team and their own guts and imagination. Together with their teammates they must try to do alone a job that thousands were trained to do. Included in the game book there are extensive details on the Morrow Project's teams, vehicles, weapons, other equipment, medical details, the various dangers arising from nuclear weapons effects, and also information to help the Project Director decide which people and creatures exist in the post-holocaust world -- in particular various animals affected in either more or less scientifically accurate ways. Up until Fourth Edition, there was also detailed information on which locations in the United States had been struck by Soviet ICBMs, which of the enemy MIRVs had failed to detonate, and which had struck targets other than those intended. = MARS, recon, science and specialty = While each team is equipped to survive on its own, it proved impossible to equip all the teams for every postwar contingency. For example, some Recon Teams are almost as heavily armed as MARS Teams, while others are not. With teams having been put to sleep over a course of several years from the 1960s onwards, there will also be variations in the equipment they have. In some cases, teams may wake to find new equipment they are not yet trained on, and will have to teach themselves from instructional materials. Below is a general summary of the Project groups: * Recon: The general purpose teams of the Project and the most numerous, Recon teams are equipped with varying types of weapons and equipment ranging from V-150 armored cars to SK-5 hovercraft. Their orders are to reconnoiter the countryside, report on local conditions, and provide advice to Prime Base concerning which teams should be awakened next. * MARS: These teams make up the military arm of the Project -- they are extremely formidable and heavily armed. In addition to conventional weapons, some of these teams have man- portable laser weapons, and some have an early generation of no-nonsense, minimalist powered armor. The purpose of the MARS teams is to support and defend civilians and other teams. A large portion of MARS team members are ex- military personnel with combat experience. MARS stands for Mobile Assault, Rescue and Strike. Some MARS teams have heavy vehicles such as the Mars One. The Mars One is a large custom-built articulated vehicle with very heavy armor and powerful weapons. It is able to carry troops, employ onboard sensors, provide early warning, and serve as a command post. * Science: The Science teams are broadly cross-trained scientific and technical units that can cope with a wide range of situations -- from complex medical care and epidemiology to understanding unusual hazards and dangerous creatures. Their areas of knowledge range from biology to nuclear physics. They are equipped with a second type of versatile custom-built articulated vehicle, called the Science One, and have armament second only to that of the MARS teams. * Specialty: This is a broad term applied to Project groups that have a non-standard function in regard to their equipment and personnel. Specialty groups generally consist of assets frozen with orders to meet at a predesignated point. Most Specialty teams are not as heavily armed as Recon or MARS teams, because the Project's planners felt that those teams could not fully perform the necessary functions if survivors felt threatened by them. Specialty groups assigned to the Project include: :Engineering: Building, construction, repair and maintenance of Project and civilian equipment. :Agricultural: Farming and livestock preserved by using frozen embryos. Equipped to build and assist farming communities. :Psychological: Formed to handle extremist groups, riots, negotiation challenges, and other serious problems caused by stress. :Aviation: Air survey reconnaissance, fire support, and air mobility support for other teams. These missions are done with fixed-wing aircraft including cargo planes, as well as light helicopters, early types of unmanned aerial vehicles, and custom-built autogyros that are modular and man-portable. :Command: Oversight of Combined Group assets, both mobile field teams and fixed installations, generally for a city or limited geographical area such as. Combined Group Seattle. :Frozen Watch: Casualty replacement personnel for the field teams, as well as Morrow Project field police, internal security, and counterintelligence functions. :Power Reception: Reception of electrical power which is scheduled to be transmitted via microwaves, once Morrow Project power satellites have been lofted. :Support: Logistical support such as supply, repair, and replacement operations. :Communications: Restore radio frequency, laser microwave, and eventually even satellite communications. They also maintain the project's clandestine extremely low frequency systems that very slowly accumulate Prime Base's messages, such as briefings, for teams to read when they awaken‚Äîthus counterbalancing the minuscule data rate. For security reasons, ELF systems were not for use until after the war. :Medical: Health care for the general population and for project assets. Generally equipped with a fixed installation. :Decontamination: Render safe personnel, vehicles and structures contaminated by radiological, biological, or chemical hazards. Also assist in the salvage of equipment and materials recovered from unsafe areas. Publications =Supplements= * Game Master's Package: Basic Vehicular Loads was a supplement detailing basic equipment loads, with three copies of each, for 11 different Morrow Project vehicles. It was published by Timeline Ltd. in 1980 as 39 xeroxed sheets, stapled in groups. A second edition was published in 1980, as 39 loose-leaf hole-punched sheets with a large envelope. William A. Barton reviewed Vehicular Basic Loads in The Space Gamer No. 48.

Barton commented that \\"overall, I'd have to give The Morrow Project the highest of ratings as a SF role- playing system. If it isn't at least nominated for the Origins awards this year, there just ain't no justice in gameland.\\". In the June 1981 edition of Dragon (Issue #50), Bill Fawcett thought the combat realism of the rules made it \\"suitable, with very few changes, for a role-playing game of World War III infantry and armored combat.\\" He did note the resultant complexity of the rules, saying, \\"The price of this realism is the great amount of dice-rolling necessary to determine the location and effect of wounds.\\" Fawcett was not as impressed with the rest of the rules. \\"There is nothing too distinctive about the game system as a whole.\\" He suggested that two types of gamers would be interested in this game: \\"those who are interested in modern weapons and combat, and those who play the Gamma World game, who will find the ideas in this game readily adaptable to that system.\\" Chris Baylis reviewed The Morrow Project for Imagine magazine, and stated that \\"My first impressions of the Morrow Project made me want to begin a game immediately. The idea seemed new and exciting, and the system looked advanced, well thought out and imaginative.\\" Phil Masters reviewed The Morrow Project for White Dwarf #42, giving it an overall rating of 5 out of 10, and stated that \\"The Morrow Project is a game with a very specific style, a lot of strengths. and a lot of weaknesses. Like any post-holocaust game, it may be a little depressing; it is certainly quite violent. It is, by current standards, simple and playable, and could be worse at the price.\\"  References  * Different Worlds #33 (March/April, 1984)  External links  *Timeline Ltd home page *Morrow Project Travel and Adventure Guide *Entry in RPG.net Game Index * Morrow Project Ideas blog * Morrow Project North blog *Another Morrow Project blog *An interactive Google map to map out how the bombs would have fallen *Morrow Project 4th Edition on Project Kickstarter * Category:Military role-playing games Category:Post-apocalyptic role-playing games Category:Role-playing games introduced in 1980 Category:Science fiction role-playing games ","title":"The Morrow Project"},{"id":"403068","text":"The United Workers' Party may refer to: *Polish United Workers' Party *United Workers' Party (Dominica) *United Workers Party (Guyana) *United Workers Party (Israel), commonly known as Mapam *United Workers Party (Saint Lucia) *United Workers Party (United States) Category:Political party disambiguation pages ","title":"United Workers' Party"},{"id":"403069","title":"Charles, Prince of Viana"},{"id":"403070","text":"National Democratic Congress may refer to: * National Democratic Congress (Ghana) * National Democratic Congress (Grenada) * National Democratic Congress (Zambia) See also *National Democratic Party (Egypt) ","title":"National Democratic Congress"},{"id":"403071","text":"New National Party may refer to: * New National Party (Grenada) * New National Party (Netherlands) * New National Party (South Africa) * New National Party, a proposed name for the National Democratic Party (Egypt) See also * National Party (disambiguation) ","title":"New National Party"},{"id":"403072","text":"Alliance for Democracy may refer to: * Alliance for Democracy (Dominican Republic) * Alliance for Democracy (Malawi) * Alliance for Democracy in Mali * Alliance for Democracy (Nigeria) * Alliance for Democracy (UK) * Alliance for Democracy (USA) * Alliance for Democracy, a fictional multinational organization in S.

Su√°rez was Spain's first democratically elected Prime Minister since the Second Spanish Republic and a key figure in the country's transition to democracy after the dictatorship of Francisco Franco. When Spain was still an autocratic regime, he was appointed Prime Minister by King Juan Carlos in 1976, hoping that his government could bring about democracy. At the time of his appointment, he was not a well-known figure, making many political forces skeptical of his government. However, he oversaw the end of the Francoist Cortes, and the legalisation of all political parties (including the Communist Party, a particularly difficult move). He led the Union of the Democratic Centre and won the 1977 general election. In 1981, he resigned and founded the party Centro Democr√°tico y Social (CDS), which was elected to the Cortes numerous times. He retired from politics in 1991 and from public life in 2003, due to Alzheimer's disease. Early life Adolfo Su√°rez was the eldest son of Hip√≥lito Su√°rez Guerra and Herminia Gonz√°lez Prados (√Åvila, 1910 ‚Äì 18 July 2006), and the brother of Hip√≥lito, Mar√≠a del Carmen (who is married to Aurelio Delgado Mart√≠n), Ricardo and Jos√© Mar√≠a.Adolfo Su√°rez Gonz√°lez, 1. duque de Su√°rez, Geneall.es, at Generall.net He was born in Cebreros. He later studied law at Salamanca University. Political career Su√°rez held several government posts during the late Francoist State. He became the Minister Secretary General of the National Movement (Movimiento Nacional), a body that served as the sole political party in Spain for 38 years, a period that extended beyond the death of Franco in November 1975. At a rally just a month before Franco's death, Su√°rez was queried by the aging Caudillo on the political future of Spain and told him frankly that the Movement would not likely long survive Franco and that democratisation was inevitable.Payne, S.G. The Franco Regime, 1936‚Äì1975. Madison: University of Wisconsin, 1987. p 616. Su√°rez was appointed as the Prime Minister of Spain by King Juan Carlos on 3 July 1976, a move opposed by leftists and some centrists given his Francoist history. As a nationalist, he was chosen by the monarch to lead the country towards a democratic, parliamentary monarchy without annoying the powerful conservative factions (especially the military) in the nation. Surprising many observers and political opponents, Su√°rez introduced Political Reform in 1976 as a first, decisive step in the transition to democracy (La Transici√≥n). In 1977, Su√°rez led the Union of the Democratic Centre (Uni√≥n de Centro Democr√°tico, UCD) to victory in Spain's first free elections in 41 years, and became the first democratically elected prime minister of the post-Francoist Spain. Su√°rez's centrist government instituted democratic reforms, and his coalition won the 1979 elections under the new constitution. Less successful as a day-to-day organiser than as a crisis manager, he resigned as Prime Minister on 29 January 1981.Preston, Paul, \\"Juan Carlos: Steering Spain from Dictatorship to Democracy\\", page 457. Harper Perennial, 2005. A month later, as parliament was taking a vote to confirm Su√°rez's replacement as Prime Minister Leopoldo Calvo-Sotelo, parliament was disrupted by the entrance of Lieutenant Colonel Tejero and his attempted coup.Cercas, Javier, \\"The Anatomy of a Moment\\". Bloomsbury, 2011. . The 23-F coup attempt (\\"El Tejerazo\\") shook the government, but was defeated. In 1982, Su√°rez founded the Democratic and Social Centre (Centro Democr√°tico y Social, CDS) party, which never achieved the success of UCD, though Su√°rez and its party were important elements in the Liberal International, joining it in 1988, leading to it being renamed Liberal and Progressive International, and Su√°rez became President of the Liberal International in 1988. He retired from active politics in 1991, for personal reasons. Former Prime Minister Adolfo Su√°rez in Buenos Aires, 1981. In 1981, he was raised into the Spanish nobility by King Juan Carlos of Spain and given the hereditary title of \\"Duque de Su√°rez\\" (Duke of Su√°rez), together with the title Grande de Espa√±a (English: Grandee of Spain) following his resignation as Prime Minister and in recognition of his role in the transition to democracy. Su√°rez was awarded the Pr√≠ncipe de Asturias a la Concordia in September 1996 for his role in Spain's early democracy. On 8 June 2007, during the celebration of the 30th anniversary of the first democratic elections, King Juan Carlos appointed Su√°rez the 1,193rd Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece.BOE 07-06-09, Spanish official journal. Retrieved 9 June 2007. He was also a member of the Club de Madrid, an independent organization (based in Madrid) that is composed of more than 80 former democratic Prime Ministers and Presidents.

Illness and death Suarez's grave in the cloister of √Åvila Cathedral On 31 May 2005, Su√°rez's son, Adolfo Su√°rez Illana, announced on Spanish television that his father was suffering from Alzheimer's disease. The announcement followed speculation about Su√°rez's health in the Spanish media. On 21 March 2014, his son announced that his death from neurological deterioration was imminent. Su√°rez then died as a result of a respiratory infection on 23 March 2014 in a clinic in Madrid.Fallece Adolfo Su√°rez, el presidente de la Transici√≥n, El Mundo, 23 March 2014 Suarez was given a state funeral and was buried in the cloister of √Åvila Cathedral.

Originally a member of Company Flow, El-P has been a driving force in alternative hip hop for over two decades, producing for rappers such as Aesop Rock, Mr. Lif, and Cage, among others. He is the co-founder, owner, and CEO of the Definitive Jux record label, and was a member of The Weathermen. Having released four solo studio albums between 2002 and 2012 that were critically acclaimed by underground audiences, El-P began experiencing mainstream success in 2013 when he and rapper Killer Mike formed the hip hop duo Run the Jewels. They have released four studio albums: Run the Jewels (2013), Run the Jewels 2 (2014), Run the Jewels 3 (2016), and RTJ4 (2020). Early life El-P was born Jaime Meline in the Brooklyn borough of New York City on March 2, 1975, the son of Nan Dillon and jazz pianist Harry Meline, who performed under the name Harry Keyes. He is of Cajun, Irish, and Lithuanian-Jewish descent.URB Magazine 2002 via DanielChamberlin.com Accessed December 2015. Career =Early career= Getting involved with the hip hop culture of New York City at an early age, El-P decided to pursue a career in music after being expelled from several schools for problems with authority. At his 17th birthday party, he met Mr. Len, whom he had hired as a DJ for the night. The two quickly became friends and formed Company Flow in 1992. They released their first vinyl single, \\"Juvenile Techniques\\", in 1992. Bigg Jus later joined the group and in 1996 the trio released its debut EP, Funcrusher. Subject to a major-label bidding war after the success of the EP, Company Flow waited until it could get a contract on its own terms. The group eventually signed with Rawkus Records, and released its debut full-length album, Funcrusher Plus (1997). After an instrumental album titled Little Johnny From the Hospitul: Breaks & Instrumentals Vol.1 (1999), also on Rawkus, disagreements between El-P and the label led to Company Flow leaving Rawkus. El-P then decided to start his own record label, Definitive Jux (known informally as Def Jux, and extra-formally as Definitive Juxtapositions), and because of critically acclaimed albums such as Cannibal Ox's The Cold Vein (produced by El-P) and Aesop Rock's Labor Days, the label quickly rose to prominence. Company Flow dissolved amicably in 2001 and the following year El-P released his debut solo album Fantastic Damage, to wide critical acclaim. In 2004, El-P collaborated with the Blue Series Continuum for a jazz-fusion album titled High Water, which received favorable reviews from both the hip hop and jazz worlds, as well as from more mainstream critics independent of both scenes. 2005 saw the release of Collecting the Kid, an odds-and-ends assortment including work from High Water and Bomb the System, in addition to several songs of unknown provenance. El-P's second proper studio album, I'll Sleep When You're Dead, was released on March 20, 2007. It generally received very favorable reviews and became El-P's most commercially successful album as a solo artist to date, peaking at No. 78 on the U.S. Billboard 200. In an interview about I'll Sleep When You're Dead, he identifies himself as an atheist. In October 2009, El-P announced that he was working on his third studio album, titled Cancer 4 Cure. El-P also was a part of a group called Central Services, which consisted of El-P, Camu Tao, and Allysin Baker. In the fall of 2010, the EP Forever Frozen in Television Time, was released exclusively on the Def Jux digital download service. In August 2011, it was announced that El-P signed with Fat Possum Records, which would release Cancer 4 Cure. Later that month, El-P released a single off the upcoming album, via the Adult Swim Singles program, titled \\"Drones Over BKLYN\\". On February 22, 2012 El-P announced on his Facebook page that Cancer 4 Cure was officially complete. The album was later released to music retailers on May 22. =Run the Jewels= Run the Jewels, a current collaboration of El-P with Atlanta- based rapper Killer Mike, was formed in 2013. The two rappers were introduced to each other by Adult Swim executive Jason DeMarco in 2011. The meeting led to several collaborations, including Killer Mike being featured on the song \\"Tougher Colder Killer\\" from Cancer 4 Cure while El-P produced the entirety of Killer Mike's sixth album R.A.P. Music. When R.A.P. Music and Cancer 4 Cure were released within weeks of each other, a joint tour was planned. The success of the tour eventually led to the formation of Run the Jewels. The duo released their self-titled debut album on June 26, 2013. They released Run the Jewels 2 on October 28, 2014. Run the Jewels 3 was released on December 24, 2016, three weeks prior to the previously announced release date of January 13, 2017. Run the Jewels 4 was released on June 3rd, 2020. All of their albums to date have been released for free. =Production and featured appearances= El-P has contributed productions and guest rhymes to albums by Aesop Rock, Evil Nine, DJ Krush, Murs, Cage, Mr. Lif, Prefuse 73, Del tha Funkee Homosapien, Mike Ladd, The High and Mighty, Jedi Mind Tricks, Aceyalone, Atmosphere, Techno Animal, and Das Racist. He collaborated with Alec Empire on the first Handsome Boy Modeling School album and with Cage and Chino Moreno on the second. He was selected, along with DJ Shadow, to work on Rage Against the Machine frontman Zack de la Rocha's solo album (which never materialized). He has provided remixes for the likes of Beans (of Anti-Pop Consortium), Beck, Blackalicious, Head Automatica, Hot Hot Heat, Dizzee Rascal, Syd Matters, Nine Inch Nails, Push Button Objects, Rob Sonic, TV on the Radio, Lorde, and Yasushilde, among others. El-P also provided the soundtrack for the graffiti film Bomb the System. =Film scoring= El-P was the principal composer for the 2005 film Bomb the System; he was one of the candidates to score a trailer for 2017's Blade Runner 2049, but his score was \\"rejected or ignored\\". He created the score for the 2020 biopic Capone.https://www.nme.com/news/el-p- shares-score-tom-hardy-movie-capone-2678768 Style El-P's rapping style is characterized by dense, aggressive, and verbose attacks which include heavy use of metaphors, sci-fi fantasy themes, pop culture references, and associative wordplay. His lyrics often feature themes found in the works of sci-fi author Philip K. Dick, such as paranoia and questions about the nature of reality. Reviewing his 2002 album Fantastic Damage, critic Steve Huey described El-P as \\"one of the most technically gifted MCs of his time, spitting out near-impossible phrases and rhythmic variations that simply leave the listener's head spinning\\". El-P's 2004 album High Water was a radical departure, pitting his beats and production against a jazz band under the direction of pianist Matthew Shipp, a fan of El-P's music. In a 2003 interview with Shipp for BOMB magazine, El-P stated, \\"First and foremost, I wanted to [make a different album] because it scared the shit out of me. And when I get offered the chance to be involved with something that scares me, I usually do it, because I'm trying to learn, I'm trying to understand music as much as I can, to become a better musician in general and work in different capacities.\\" Personal life El-P was kicked out of high school and went to musical engineering school at Center For The Media Arts in Manhattan instead of high school. El-P married comedian and musician Emily Panic in October 2018.

Modern Argentine culture has been largely influenced by Italian, Spanish, and other European immigration, while there is still a lesser degree of elements of Amerindian and African origin and influence, particularly in the fields of music and art. Buenos Aires, its cultural capital, is largely characterized by both the prevalence of people of European descent, and of European styles in architecture.Luongo, Michael. Frommer's Argentina. Wiley Publishing, 2007. Museums, cinemas, and galleries are abundant in all the large urban centers, as well as traditional establishments such as literary bars, or bars offering live music of a variety of genres. Argentine writer reflected on the nature of the culture of Argentina as follows: Language The spoken languages of Argentina number at least 40, although Spanish is dominant. Others include native and other immigrant languages; some languages are extinct and others are endangered, spoken by elderly people whose descendants do not speak the languages.Gordon, Raymond G., Jr. (ed.), 2005. Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Fifteenth edition. Dallas, Tex.: SIL International. Online version: Languages of Argentina, Retrieved on 2 January 2007. The most prevalent dialect is Rioplatense, also known as \\"Argentine Spanish\\", whose speakers are located primarily in the basin of the R√≠o de la Plata. Argentines are amongst the few Spanish-speaking countries (like Uruguay, Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Honduras) that almost universally use what is known as voseo ‚Äì the use of the pronoun vos instead of t√∫ (Spanish for \\"you\\"). In many of the central and north-eastern areas of the country, the \\"rolling r\\" takes on the same sound as the ll and y ('zh' ‚Äì a voiced palatal fricative sound, similar to the \\"s\\" in the English pronunciation of the word \\"vision\\"). South Bolivian Quechua is a Quechuan language spoken by some 800,000 people, mostly immigrants who have arrived in the last years. There are 70,000 estimated speakers in Salta Province. The language is also known as Central Bolivian Quechua, which has six dialects. It is classified as a Quechua II language, and is referred to as Quechua IIC by linguists. Guaran√≠ is also spoken, mainly in the Mesopotamia, and is an official language in the province of Corrientes.Ley N¬∫ 5598 Poder Legislativo de Corrientes, 28 September 2004 Literature Argentine literary figures: Julio Cort√°zar, Victoria Ocampo, Jorge Luis Borges and Adolfo Bioy Casares Argentina has a detailed literary history, as well as one of the region's most active publishing industries. Argentine writers have figured prominently in Latin American literature, since becoming a fully united entity in the 1850s, with a strong constitution and a defined nation- building plan. The struggle between the Federalists (who favored a loose confederation of provinces based on rural conservatism) and the Unitarians (pro-liberalism and advocates of a strong central government that would encourage European immigration), set the tone for Argentine literature of the time.Wilson, Jason. Cultural Guide to the City of Buenos Aires'. Oxford, England: Signal Books, 1999. The ideological divide between gaucho epic Mart√≠n Fierro by Jos√© Hern√°ndez, and Facundoe-libro.net. Free digital books. by Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, is a great example. Hern√°ndez, a federalist, was opposed to the centralizing, modernizing, and Europeanizing tendencies. Sarmiento wrote in support of immigration as the only way to save Argentina from becoming subject to the rule of a small number of dictatorial caudillo families, arguing such immigrants would make Argentina more modern and open to Western European influences, and therefore a more prosperous society.Levene, Ricardo. A history of Argentina. University of Noerth Carolina Press, 1937. Argentine literature of that period was fiercely nationalist. It was followed by the modernist movement, which emerged in France in the late 19th century, and this period in turn was followed by vanguardism, with Ricardo G√ºiraldes as an important reference. Jorge Luis Borges, its most acclaimed writer, found new ways of looking at the modern world in metaphor and philosophical debate, and his influence has extended to writers all over the globe. Borges is most famous for his works in short stories, such as Ficciones and The Aleph. Some of the nation's notable writers, poets, and intellectuals include: Juan Bautista Alberdi, Jorge Luis Borges, Roberto Arlt, Enrique Banchs, Adolfo Bioy Casares, Silvina Bullrich, Eugenio Cambaceres, Julio Cort√°zar, Esteban Echeverr√≠a, Leopoldo Lugones, Eduardo Mallea, Ezequiel Mart√≠nez Estrada, Tom√°s Eloy Mart√≠nez, Victoria Ocampo, Manuel Puig, Ernesto Sabato, Osvaldo Soriano, Alfonsina Storni, Mar√≠a Elena Walsh and Oliverio Girondo.  Visual arts  =Painting and sculpture= The haystacks (1911) by Mart√≠n Malharro. He is considered the introducer of Impressionism in Argentina. Marta Minuj√≠n's Tower of Babel (2011) Argentine painters and sculptors have a rich history, dating from both before and since the development of modern Argentina in the second half of the 19th century. Artistic production did not truly come into its own, until after the 1852 overthrow of the repressive regime of Juan Manuel de Rosas. Immigrants like Eduardo Schiaffino, Eduardo S√≠vori, Reynaldo Giudici, Emilio Caraffa, and Ernesto de la C√°rcova left behind a realist heritage influential to this day. Impressionism did not make itself evident among Argentine artists until after 1900, however, and never acquired the kind of following it did in Europe, though it did inspire influential Argentine post- impressionists such as Mart√≠n Malharro, Ram√≥n Silva, Cleto Ciocchini, Fernando Fader, P√≠o Collivadino, Ces√°reo Bernaldo de Quir√≥s, Realism, and aestheticism continued to set the agenda in Argentine painting and sculpture, noteworthy during this era for the sudden fame of sculptor Lola Mora, a student of Auguste Rodin's. As Lola Mora had been until she fell out of favor with local high society, monumental sculptors became in very high demand after 1900, particularly by municipal governments and wealthy families, who competed with each other in boasting the most evocative mausolea for their dearly departed. Though most preferred French and Italian sculptors, work by locals Erminio Blotta, √Ångel Mar√≠a de Rosa, and Rogelio Yrurtia resulted in a proliferation of soulful monuments and memorials made them immortal. Not as realist as the work of some of his belle-√©poque predecessors in sculpture, Yrurtia's subtle impressionism inspired Argentine students like Antonio Puj√≠a, whose internationally prized female torsos always surprise admirers with their whimsical and surreal touches, while Pablo Curatella Manes' sculptures drew from cubism. The frescoed dome of Galer√≠as Pac√≠fico was painted by muralists Berni, Castagnino, Colmeiro, Spilimbergo and Urruch√∫a. Becoming an intellectual, as well as artistic circle, painters like Antonio Berni, Lino Enea Spilimbergo, and Juan Carlos Castagnino were friends as well as colleagues, going on to collaborate on masterpieces like the ceiling at the Galerias Pacifico arcade in Buenos Aires, towards 1933. As in Mexico and elsewhere, muralism became increasingly popular among Argentine artists. Among the first to use his drab surroundings as a canvas was Benito Quinquela Mart√≠n, whose vaguely cubist pastel-colored walls painted in his Buenos Aires neighborhood of La Boca during the 1920s and 1930s, have become historical monuments and Argentine cultural emblems, worldwide. Lithographs, likewise, found a following in Argentina sometime after they had been made popular elsewhere. In Argentina, artists like Adolfo Bellocq, used this medium to portray often harsh working conditions in Argentina's growing industrial sector, during the 1920s and 1930s. Antonio Segu√≠, another lithographer, transferred his na√Øve style into murals in numerous nations, as did Ricardo Carpani, though in a realist style. The vanguard in culturally conservative Argentina, futurists and cubists like Xul Solar and Emilio Pettoruti earned a following as considerable as that of less abstract and more sentimental portrait and landscape painters, like Ra√∫l Soldi. Likewise, traditional abstract artists such as Romulo Macci√≥, Anselmo Piccoli, Eduardo Mac Entyre, Luis Felipe No√©, and Luis Seoane co-existed with equal appeal as the most conceptual mobile art creators such as the unpredictable P√©rez Celis, Gyula Kosice of the Argentine Mad√≠ Movement, and Marta Minuj√≠n, one of Andy Warhol's most esteemed fellow Conceptual artists. The emergence of avant-garde genres in Argentine sculpture also featured Pablo Curatella Manes and Roberto Aizenberg, and constructivists such as Nicol√°s Garc√≠a Uriburu and Leon Ferrari, one of the world's foremost artists in his genre, today. In the 1960s and 1970s, many of these figures' abstract art found their way into popular advertising and even corporate logos. Generally possessing a strong sentimental streak, the Argentine public's taste for na√Øve art and simple pottery cannot be overlooked. Since Prilidiano Pueyrred√≥n's day, artists in the na√Øve vein like C√°ndido L√≥pez have captured the absurdity of war; Susana Aguirre, and Aniko Szab√≥, the idiosyncrasies of everyday neighborhoods; Guillermo Roux's watercolors, a circus atmosphere; and Gato Fr√≠as, childhood memories. Illustrator Florencio Molina Campos's tongue-in-cheek depictions of gaucho life have endured as collectors' items. To help showcase Argentine and Latin American art and sculpture, local developer and art collector Eduardo Constantini set aside a significant portion of his personal collection, and in 1998, began construction on Buenos Aires' first major institution specializing in works by Latin American artists. His foundation opened the Buenos Aires Museum of Latin American Art (MALBA) in 2001. = Graphic arts = In the 1920s, Buenos Aires was overflowing with creative drawings and design. Argentine illustrators and sketchers were attracting worldwide recognition, including artists such as Jose Freire Segundo, creator of gr√°fica of Aikal (1940); Jose Luis Salinas, called upon by King Features to create a comic strip of worldwide fame, Cisco Kid; and Florencio Molina Campos, the brilliant sketcher of the Alpargatas Almanacs of rural life (1930), who collaborated on three Walt Disney films. The culmination was the arrival, in 1927, of French painter, poster artist and sculptor Lucien Achille Mauzan, who was part of the artistic Art Deco movement. He settled in Buenos Aires and founded his own company Editorial Affiches Mauzan (Editorial Mauzan Posters) and created between 130 and 150 posters in the six years he spent in Argentina.

La historieta en el mundo moderno. Barcelona: Paid√≥s. p. 144‚Äì146. =Architecture= The architecture of Argentina can be said to start at the beginning of the Spanish colonization, though it was in the 18th century that the cities of the country reached their splendour. Cities like C√≥rdoba, Salta, Mendoza, and also Buenos Aires conserved most their historical Spanish colonial architecture in spite of their urban growth. The simplicity of the Rioplatense baroque style can be clearly appreciated in Buenos Aires, in the works of Italian architects such as Andr√© Blanqui and Antonio Masella, in the churches of San Ignacio, Nuestra Se√±ora del Pilar, the Cathedral, and the Cabildo. Italian and French influences increased after the war for independence at the beginning of the 19th century, though the academic style persisted until the first decades of the 20th century. Attempts at renovation took place during the second half of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th, when the European tendencies penetrated into the country, reflected in numerous important buildings of Buenos Aires, such as the Santa Felicitam Church, by Ernesto Bunge; the Central Post Office and Palace of Justice, by Norbert Maillart; and the National Congress and the Col√≥n Opera House, by Vittorio Meano. Curutchet House, World Heritage Site in La Plata The architecture of the second half of the 20th century continued adapting French neoclassical architecture, such as the headquarters of the National Bank of Argentina, and the NH Gran Hotel Provincial, built by Alejandro Bustillo, and the Museo de Arte Hispano Fern√°ndez Blanco, by Mart√≠n Noel. Numerous Argentine architects have enriched their own country's cityscapes, and in recent decades, those around the world. Juan Antonio Buschiazzo helped popularize Beaux-Arts architecture, and Francisco Gianotti combined Art Nouveau with Italianate styles, each adding flair to Argentine cities during the early 20th century. Francisco Salamone and Viktor Sulƒâiƒâ left an Art Deco legacy, and Alejandro Bustillo created a prolific body of Rationalist architecture. Clorindo Testa introduced Brutalist architecture locally, C√©sar Pelli's and Patricio Pouchulu's Futurist creations have graced cities, worldwide. Pelli's 1980s throwbacks to the Art Deco glory of the 1920s, in particular, made him one of the world's most prestigious architects. Argentina cities have varied architecture. Commonly each house has an individual design, and is very rare to find any tract housing neighborhood.

The world's first animated feature films were made and released in Argentina, by cartoonist Quirino Cristiani, in 1917 and 1918. Argentine cinema enjoyed a 'golden age' in the 1930s through the 1950s with scores of productions, many now considered classics of Spanish-language film. The industry produced actors who became the first movie stars of Argentine cinema, often tango performers such as Libertad Lamarque, Floren Delbene, Tito Lusiardo, Tita Merello, Roberto Escalada, and Hugo del Carril. More recent films from the \\"New Wave\\" of cinema since the 1980s have achieved worldwide recognition, such as The Official Story (Best foreign film oscar in 1986), Man Facing Southeast, A Place in the World, Nine Queens, Son of the Bride, The Motorcycle Diaries, Blessed by Fire, The Secret in Their Eyes, winner of the 2009 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, and Wild Tales. Although rarely rivaling Hollywood productions in popularity, local films are released weekly, and widely followed in Argentina and internationally. A number of local films, many of which are low-budget productions, have earned prizes in cinema festivals (such as Cannes), and are promoted by events such as the Mar del Plata Film Festival and the Buenos Aires International Festival of Independent Cinema. The per capita number of screens is one of the highest in Latin America, and viewing per capita is the highest in the region. A new generation of Argentine directors have caught the attention of critics worldwide.About Gavin Esler's Argentina diary news.bbc.co.uk 3 April 2006. Cinema is an important facet of local culture, as well as a popular pastime, and levels of cinema attendance are comparable to those of European countries. Argentine composers Luis Bacalov, Gustavo Santaolalla, and Eugenio Zanetti have been honored with Academy Award for Best Original Score nods. Lalo Schifrin has received numerous Grammys, and is best known for the Mission:Impossible theme. =Music= \\"Por una Cabeza\\", a tango recorded by Carlos Gardel. Tango originated at the ending of the 19th century in the suburbs of Buenos Aires.Norese, Mar√≠a Rosal√≠a: Contextualizaci√≥n y an√°lisis del tango. Sus or√≠genes hasta la aparici√≥n de la vanguardia. Universidad de Salamanca, 2002 (Google books restricted online copy, page 6) Tango, the music and lyrics (often sung in a form of slang called lunfardo), is Argentina's musical symbol. The Milonga dance was a predecessor, slowly evolving into modern tango. By the 1930s, tango had changed from a dance- focused music to one of lyric and poetry, with singers such as Carlos Gardel, Hugo del Carril, Roberto Goyeneche, Ra√∫l Lavi√©, Tita Merello, and Edmundo Rivero. The golden age of tango (1930 to mid-1950s) mirrored that of jazz and swing in the United States, featuring large orchestral groups too, like the bands of Osvaldo Pugliese, An√≠bal Troilo, Francisco Canaro, Julio de Caro, and Juan d'Arienzo. Incorporating acoustic music and later, synthesizers into the genre after 1955, bandone√≥n virtuoso Astor Piazzolla popularized \\"new tango\\" creating a more subtle, intellectual and listener-oriented trend. Today, tango enjoys worldwide popularity; ever-evolving, neo-tango is a global phenomenon with renowned groups like Tanghetto, Bajofondo, and the Gotan Project. Known as the \\"voice of the voiceless ones\\",Singer Mercedes Sosa: The voice of the 'voiceless ones' outlasts South American dictatorships Mercedes Sosa was one of the preeminent exponents of nueva canci√≥n. Argentine rock, called rock nacional, is the most popular music among the youth. Arguably the most listened-to form of Spanish-language rock, its influence and international success are owed to a rich, uninterrupted development. Bands such as Soda Stereo or Sumo, and composers like Charly Garc√≠a, Luis Alberto Spinetta, Fito P√°ez and Andr√©s Calamaro are referents of national culture. Mid-1960s Buenos Aires and Rosario were cradles of the music, and by 1970, Argentine rock was well established among middle class youth (see: Almendra, Sui Generis, Pappo, Crucis, Pescado Rabioso). Ser√∫ Gir√°n bridged the gap into the 1980s, when Argentine bands became popular across Latin America and elsewhere (Enanitos Verdes, Fabulosos Cadillacs and Virus). There are many subgenres: underground, pop-oriented, and some associated with the working class (La Renga, Divididos, Herm√©tica, V8 and Los Redonditos). Current popular bands include Babas√≥nicos, Los Aut√©nticos Decadentes, Rata Blanca, Horcas, Attaque 77, Bersuit, Los Piojos, Catupecu Machu, Carajo and Callejeros. European classical music is well represented in Argentina. Buenos Aires is home to the world-renowned Col√≥n Theater. Classical musicians, such as Martha Argerich, Eduardo Alonso- Crespo, Daniel Barenboim, Eduardo Delgado, and Alberto Lysy, and classical composers such as Juan Jos√© Castro and Alberto Ginastera, and contemporary composers such as Osvaldo Golijov, Gerardo Gandini, and Oscar Edelstein are internationally acclaimed. All major cities in Argentina have impressive theaters or opera houses, and provincial or city orchestras. Some cities have annual events and important classical music festivals like Semana Musical Llao Llao in San Carlos de Bariloche, and the multitudinous Amadeus in Buenos Aires. Payada in a bar. Painting by Carlos Morel. Argentine folk music is uniquely vast. Beyond dozens of regional dances, a national folk style emerged in the 1930s. Per√≥n's Argentina would give rise to Nueva Canci√≥n, as artists began expressing in their music objections to political themes. Atahualpa Yupanqui, the greatest Argentine folk musician, and Mercedes Sosa would be defining figures in shaping Nueva Canci√≥n, gaining worldwide popularity in the process. The style found a huge reception in Chile, where it took off in the 1970s, and went on to influence the entirety of Latin American music.Music: 'El Derecho de vivir en paz' from http://www.msu.edu/~chapmanb/jara/enueva.html Today, Chango Spasiuk and Soledad Pastorutti have brought folk back to younger generations. Le√≥n Gieco's folk-rock bridged the gap between Argentine folklore and Argentine rock, introducing both styles to millions overseas in successive tours. =Theater= Buenos Aires is one of the world's great capitals of theater. The Teatro Col√≥n is a national landmark for opera and classical performances; built at the end of the 19th century, its acoustics are considered the best in the world, and is currently undergoing a major refurbishment in order to preserve its outstanding sound characteristics, the French-romantic style, the impressive Golden Room (a minor auditorium targeted to Chamber Music performances), and the museum at the entrance. With its theater scene of national and international caliber, Corrientes Avenue is synonymous with the art. It is thought of as the street that never sleeps, and sometimes referred to as the Broadway of Buenos Aires. Many great careers in acting, music, and film have begun in its many theaters. The Teatro General San Mart√≠n is one of the most prestigious, along Corrientes Avenue, and the Teatro Nacional Cervantes functions as the national stage theater of Argentina. The Teatro Argentino de La Plata, El C√≠rculo in Rosario, Independencia in Mendoza, and Libertador in C√≥rdoba are also prominent. Griselda Gambaro, Copi, Roberto Cossa, Marco Denevi, Carlos Gorostiza, and Alberto Vaccarezza are a few of the more prominent Argentine playwrights. Julio Bocca, Jorge Donn, Jos√© Neglia, and Norma Fontenla are some of the great ballet dancers of the modern era. Cuisine The asado (1888), by Ignacio Manzoni. Asado is considered a national dish, and is typical of Argentine families to gather on Sundays around one. Besides many of the pasta, sausage, and dessert dishes common to continental Europe, Argentines enjoy a wide variety of Indigenous and Criollo creations, which include empanadas (a stuffed pastry), locro (a mixture of maize, beans, meat, bacon, onion, and gourd), humitas, and yerba mate, all originally indigenous Amerindian staples, the latter considered Argentina's national beverage. Other popular items include chorizo (a pork sausage), facturas (Viennese-style pastry), dulce de leche, a sort of milk caramel jam and the alfajor. The Argentine barbecue asado, includes succulent types of meat, among them chorizo, sweetbread, chitterlings, and morcilla (blood sausage). Thin sandwiches, known as sandwiches de miga, are also popular. Argentines have the highest consumption of red meat in the world. The Argentine wine industry, long among the largest outside Europe, has benefited from growing investment since 1992; in 2007, 60% of foreign investment worldwide in viticulture was destined to Argentina. The country is the fifth most important wine producer in the world,Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Book of the Year (various issues): statistical appendix. with the annual per capita consumption of wine among the highest. Malbec grape, a discardable varietal in France (country of origin), has found in the Province of Mendoza an ideal environment to successfully develop and turn itself into the world's best Malbec. Mendoza accounts for 70% of the country's total wine production. \\"Wine tourism\\" is important in Mendoza province, with the impressive landscape of the Cordillera de Los Andes, and the highest peak in the Americas, Mount Aconcagua ( high) providing a very desirable destination for international tourism. Sports The official national sport of Argentina is pato, although it is not very popular. It is played with a six-handle ball on horseback. Football is the most popular sport in Argentina. The national football team has won 25 major international titles, including two FIFA World Cup, two Olympic gold medals and fourteen Copa Am√©rica. Over one thousand Argentine players play abroad, the majority of them in European football leagues. There are 331,811 registered football players, with increasing numbers of girls and women, who have organized their own national championships since 1991, and were South American champions in 2006. The Argentine Football Association (AFA) was formed in 1893, and is the eighth oldest national football association in the world. The AFA today counts 3,377 football clubs, including 20 in the Premier Division. Since the AFA went professional in 1931, fifteen teams have won national tournament titles, including River Plate with 33 and Boca Juniors with 24. Over the last twenty years, futsal and beach football have become increasingly popular. The Argentine national beach football team was one of four competitors in the first international championship for the sport, in Miami in 1993.As of October 2009, Argentina has earned the right to play the 2010 World Cup in South Africa for which it joins Nigeria, Korea Republic and Greece for qualifying in group B. Basketball is the second most popular sport; a number of basketball players play in the NBA and European leagues including Emanuel Gin√≥bili, Andr√©s Nocioni, Carlos Delfino, Luis Scola, Pablo Prigioni, Juan Ignacio S√°nchez and Fabricio Oberto. The national basketball team won the gold medal at the 2004 Summer Olympics and the bronze medal in 2008. Argentina is currently ranked third by the International Basketball Federation. Argentina has an important rugby union team, \\"Los Pumas\\", with many of its players playing in Europe. Argentina beat host nation France twice in the 2007 Rugby World Cup, placing them third in the competition, and also finished 4th in the 2015 edition of the World Cup. The Pumas are currently ranked fifth in the official world rankings. Historically, Argentina has had a strong showing within Auto racing. Juan Manuel Fangio was five times Formula One world champion under four different teams, winning 102 of his 184 international races, and is widely ranked as the greatest driver of all time. Other distinguished racers were Oscar Alfredo G√°lvez, Juan G√°lvez, Jos√© Froil√°n Gonz√°lez and Carlos Reutemann. Field hockey with the national team Las Leonas is one of the world's most successful, with four Olympic medals, two World Cups, a World League and seven Champions Trophy. Luciana Aymar is recognized as the best female player in the history of this sport. Argentina reigns undisputed in Polo, having won more international championships than any other country and been seldom beaten since the 1930s. The Argentine Polo Championship is the sport's most important international team trophy. The country is home to most of the world's top players, among them Adolfo Cambiaso, the best in Polo history. Other popular sports include tennis, handball, boxing, volleyball and golf. The Vamos vamos Argentina chant is a trademark of Argentine fans during sporting events. Values Argentine values is a shared identity core that brings together actions and thoughts aimed at increasing social capital and fostering the common good among Argentines. As Rokeach state, \\"Values are the evaluative component of an individual's attitudes and beliefs. Values guide how we think about things in terms of what is right/wrong and correct/incorrect. Values trigger positive or negative emotions. Values also guide our actions \\"(Neuliep, 2009, p. 66).Neuliep, J. W. (2009). Intercultural Communication: A Contextual Approach. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications. Argentine Values intends to create a community formed by all those who are convinced that Argentina is a great country. Argentina is a collective country where its values focus on diversity and solidarity. In addition to being a collectivistic society. The Argentines are from traditional customs, but also kind and friendly. The greeting is a crucial element in the Argentine culture where we see that nobody leaves without being greeted; Men kiss women, Women kiss men, and other men kiss men on the cheek. Another principal value for Argentines is the family. In Argentina, for example, it is prevalent for family members to visit traditionally on Sunday, meetings in which there are music, food, and games. But apart from these types of meetings, the family almost always meets for family events or gatherings such as births, weddings, and similar activities. For me that I had the experience of living three months in the country, it was very nice to see how generations come together, and \\"values are transmitted across generations\\" (Prioste, Narciso, Goncalves, & Pereira, 2017).Ana Prioste, Isabel Narciso, Miguel M.

Written by Newt Gingrich and Dick Armey, and in part using text from former President Ronald Reagan's 1985 State of the Union Address, the Contract detailed the actions the Republicans promised to take if they became the majority party in the United States House of Representatives for the first time in 40 years. Many of the Contract's policy ideas originated at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. The Contract with America was introduced six weeks before the 1994 Congressional election, the first midterm election of President Bill Clinton's Administration, and was signed by all but two of the Republican members of the House and all of the Party's non- incumbent Republican Congressional candidates. Proponents say the Contract was revolutionary in its commitment to offering specific legislation for a vote, describing in detail the precise plan of the Congressional Representatives, and broadly nationalizing the Congressional election. Furthermore, its provisions represented the view of many conservative Republicans on the issues of shrinking the size of government, promoting lower taxes and greater entrepreneurial activity, and both tort reform and welfare reform. The 1994 elections resulted in Republicans gaining 54 House and 9 U.S. Senate seats, flipping both chambers. The Contract was seen as a triumph by party leaders such as Minority Whip Newt Gingrich, Dick Armey, and the American conservative movement in general. Content The contract's text included a list of eight reforms the Republicans promised to enact, and ten bills they promised to bring to floor debate and votes, if they were made the majority following the election. During the crafting of the Contract, proposals were limited to \\"60% issues\\", i.e. legislation that polling showed garnered 60% support of the American people, intending for the Contract to avoid promises on controversial and divisive matters like abortion and school prayer. Reagan biographer Lou Cannon characterized the Contract as having taken more than half of its text from Ronald Reagan's 1985 State of the Union Address. =Government and operational reforms= On the first day of their majority in the House, the Republicans promised to bring up for vote, eight major reforms: # require all laws that apply to the rest of the country also apply to Congress; # select a major, independent auditing firm to conduct a comprehensive audit of Congress for waste, fraud or abuse; # cut the number of House committees, and cut committee staff by one-third; # limit the terms of all committee chairs; # ban the casting of proxy votes in committee; # require committee meetings to be open to the public; # require a three-fifths majority vote to pass a tax increase; # guarantee an honest accounting of the Federal Budget by implementing zero base-line budgeting. =Major policy changes= During the first one hundred days of the 104th Congress, the Republicans pledged \\"to bring to the floor the following [ten] bills, each to be given a full and open debate, each to be given a clear and fair vote, and each to be immediately available for public inspection\\". The text of the proposed bills was included in the Contract, which was released prior to the election. These bills were not governmental operational reforms, as the previous promises were; rather, they represented significant changes to policy. They mainly included a balanced budget requirement, tax cuts for small businesses, families and seniors, term limits for legislators, social security reform, tort reform, and welfare reform. Implementation The contract had promised to bring to floor debate and votes 10 bills that would implement major reform of the federal government. When the 104th Congress assembled in January 1995, the Republican majority sought to implement the Contract. In some cases (e.g. The National Security Restoration Act and The Personal Responsibility Act), the proposed bills were accomplished by a single act analogous to that which had been proposed in the Contract; in other cases (e.g. The Job Creation and Wage Enhancement Act), a proposed bill's provisions were split up across multiple acts. Most of the bills died in the Senate, except as noted below. =The Fiscal Responsibility Act= An amendment to the Constitution that would require a balanced budget unless sanctioned by a two-thirds vote in both houses of Congress (H.J.Res.1, passed by the US House Roll Call: 300-132, January 26, 1995, but rejected by the US Senate: Roll Call 65‚Äì35 (the amendment was defeated by a single vote, with one Republican opposed, Oregon Republican Senator Mark Hatfield; Dole cast a procedural vote against the amendment to bring it up again in the future), March 2, 1995, two-thirds required. Legislation (not an amendment) provided the president with a line- item veto (H.R.2, passed by the US House Roll Call: 294‚Äì134, February 6, 1995; conferenced with S. 4 and enacted with substantial changes April 9, 1996). The statute was ruled unconstitutional in Clinton v. City of New York, , , (1998). =The Taking Back Our Streets Act= An anti-crime package including stronger truth in sentencing, \\"good faith\\" exclusionary rule exemptions (H.R.666 Exclusionary Rule Reform Act, passed US House Roll Call 289‚Äì142 February 8, 1995), death penalty provisions (H.R.729 Effective Death Penalty Act, passed US House Roll Call 297‚Äì132 February 8, 1995; similar provisions enacted under S. 735 , April 24, 1996), funding prison construction (H.R.667 Violent Criminal Incarceration Act, passed US House Roll Call 265‚Äì156 February 10, 1995, rc#117) and additional law enforcement (H.R.728 Local Government Law Enforcement Block Grants Act, passed US House Roll Call 238‚Äì192 February 14, 1995). =The Personal Responsibility Act= An act to discourage illegitimacy and teen pregnancy by reforming and cutting cash welfare and related programs. This would be achieved by prohibiting welfare to mothers under 18 years of age, denying increased Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) for additional children while on welfare, and enacting a two-years-and-out provision with work requirements to promote individual responsibility. H.R.4, the Family Self-Sufficiency Act, included provisions giving food vouchers to unwed mothers under 18 in lieu of cash AFDC benefits, denying cash AFDC benefits for additional children to people on AFDC, requiring recipients to participate in work programs after 2 years on AFDC, complete termination of AFDC payments after five years, and suspending driver and professional licenses of people who fail to pay child support. H.R.4, passed by the US House 234‚Äì199, March 23, 1995, and passed by the US Senate 87‚Äì12, September 19, 1995. The Act was vetoed by President Clinton, but the alternative Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act which offered many of the same policies was enacted August 22, 1996. =The American Dream Restoration Act= An act to create a $500-per-child tax credit, add a tax credit for couples who pay more taxes in aggregate if they are married than if they were single (but keep in place the fiction of Earned Income Splitting), and creation of American Dream Savings Accounts to provide middle-class tax relief. H.R.1215, passed 246‚Äì188, April 5, 1995. =The National Security Restoration Act= An act to prevent U.S. troops from serving under United Nations command unless the president determines it is necessary for the purposes of national security, to cut U.S. payments for UN peacekeeping operations, and to help establish guidelines for the voluntary integration of former Warsaw Pact nations into NATO. H.R.7, passed 241‚Äì181, February 16, 1995. =The Common Sense Legal Reform Act= An act to institute \\"loser pays\\" laws (H.R.988, passed 232‚Äì193, March 7, 1995), limits on punitive damages and weakening of product-liability laws to prevent what the bill considered frivolous litigation (H.R.956, passed 265‚Äì161, March 10, 1995; passed Senate 61‚Äì37, May 11, 1995, vetoed by President Clinton Another tort reform bill, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act was enacted in 1995 when Congress overrode a veto by Clinton. =The Job Creation and Wage Enhancement Act= A package of measures to act as small-business incentives: capital-gains cuts and indexation, neutral cost recovery, risk assessment/cost-benefit analysis, strengthening the Regulatory Flexibility Act and unfunded mandate reform to create jobs and raise worker wages. Although this was listed as a single bill in the Contract, its provisions ultimately made it to the House Floor as four bills: * H.R.5, requiring federal funding for state spending mandated by Congressional action and estimated by the Congressional Budget Office to cost more than $50m per year (for the years of 1996‚Äì2002), was passed 360‚Äì74, February 1, 1995. This bill was conferenced with S. 1 and enacted, March 22, 1995 * H.R.450 required a moratorium on the implementation of federal regulations until June 30, 1995, and was passed 276‚Äì146, February 24, 1995. Companion Senate bill S. 219 passed by voice vote, May 17, 1995, but the two bills never emerged from conference * H.R.925 required federal compensation to be paid to property owners when federal government actions reduced the value of the property by 20% or more, and was passed 277‚Äì148, March 3, 1995. * H.R.926, passed 415‚Äì14 on March 1, 1995, required federal agencies to provide a cost-benefit analysis on any regulation costing $50m or more annually, to be signed off on by the Office of Management and Budget, and permitted small businesses to sue that agency if they believed the aforementioned analysis was performed inadequately or incorrectly. =The Citizen Legislature Act= An amendment to the Constitution that would have imposed 12-year term limits on members of the US Congress (i.e. six terms for Representatives, two terms for Senators). rejected by the U.S. House 227‚Äì204 (a constitutional amendment requires a two-thirds majority, not a simple majority), March 29, 1995; RC #277. =Other sections= Other sections of the contract include a proposed Family Reinforcement Act (tax incentives for adoption, strengthening the powers of parents in their children's education, stronger child pornography laws, and elderly dependent care tax credit) and the Senior Citizens Fairness Act (raise the Social Security earnings limit, repeal the 1993 tax hikes on Social Security benefits and provide tax incentives for private long-term care insurance). Non-implementation A November 13, 2000, article by Edward H. Crane, president of the libertarian Cato Institute, stated, \\"the combined budgets of the 95 major programs that the Contract with America promised to eliminate have increased by 13%.\\" Effects Some observers cite the Contract with America as having helped secure a decisive victory for the Republicans in the 1994 elections; others dispute this role, noting its late introduction into the campaign. Whatever the role of the Contract, Republicans were elected to a majority of both houses of Congress for the first time since 1953, and some parts of the Contract were enacted. Most elements did not pass in Congress, while others were vetoed by, or substantially altered in negotiations with President Bill Clinton, who would sarcastically refer to it as the \\"Contract on America\\". As a blueprint for the policy of the new Congressional majority, Micklethwait and Wooldridge argue in The Right Nation that the Contract placed the Congress firmly back in the driver's seat of domestic government policy for most of the 104th Congress, and placed the Clinton White House firmly on the defensive. George Mason University law professor David E. Bernstein has argued that the Contract \\"show[ed] ... that [Congress took] federalism and limited national government seriously\\", and \\"undoubtedly made [the Supreme Court decision in] United States v. Lopez more viable\\". Journalist and senior congressional reporter Major Garrett equated the Contract with a game of miniature golf, \\"fun, popular, and largely diversionary exercise meant to satisfy middle-class sensibilities\\", contrasted with the golf of governing America and leadership. Republicans interviewed by Garrett when the Contract was being compiled said it was meant to be a political document of easy goals, not a governing document, with one senior aide explaining, \\"We don't care if the Senate passes any of the items in the contract. It would be preferable, but it's not necessary. If the freshmen do everything the contract says, they'll be in excellent shape for 1996\\". In 2014, business and finance writer John Steele Gordon, writing in The American, an online magazine published by the American Enterprise Institute, said that \\"(t)he main reason (for the Republican victory in 1994) was surely the Contract with America\\", in part because it \\"nationalized the election, making it one of reform versus business as usual. The people voted for reform.\\" Gordon wrote that the Contract \\"turned out to be a brilliant political ploy. The contract tuned in to the American electorate‚Äôs deep yearning for reform in Washington, a yearning that had expressed itself in the elections of both (U.S. Presidents) Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan.\\" He described the election of 1994 as an \\"epic slaughter of the majority party in Congress\\" that \\"changed American politics for the foreseeable future\\", and that \\"[a]fter 60 years of Democratic dominance in American politics, the two parties were on a par.\\" He concludes that \\"[t]he main reason was surely the Contract with America\\".

It is a member of the Liberal International and the Africa Liberal Network. The DA traces its roots to the founding of the anti-apartheid Progressive Party in 1959, with many mergers and name changes between that time and the present. In addition to governing several major metropolitan municipalities, the DA has been governing the Western Cape, one of South Africa's nine provinces, since the 2009 general election, having won a bigger majority at the election in 2014, but slightly losing support in the 2019 election. The party draws its support predominantly from Afrikaans and English-speaking people (80%+), people aged over 35 (65%+), and white people (50%+), as well as the Indian South African community and the Coloured community.  History  =Beginnings in the Democratic Party= Although the Democratic Alliance in its present form is fairly new, its roots can be traced far back in South African political history, through a complex sequence of splits and mergers. The modern day DA is in large part a product of the white parliamentary opposition to the ruling National Party. The origin of the party can be traced to the mid 1950s when some younger members of the United Party felt that they were not providing strong enough opposition to the National Party and its policy of Apartheid, causing them to break away and form the Progressive Party in 1959. In the 1970s, as it rose to become the official opposition, the party would merge with more splinters from the disintegrating United Party and become known first as the Progressive Reform Party and then as the Progressive Federal Party. The Progressives sought to change the system from within, but in doing so chose to comply with Apartheid legislation outlawing multi-racial membership. During this time, the party was led by liberal-minded opponents of apartheid, such as Jan Steytler, Helen Suzman, Zach de Beer, Colin Eglin, Frederik van Zyl Slabbert and Harry Schwarz. In 1989, it would merge with two smaller reformist organisations to become the Democratic Party, a name that was retained into the 1990s when freedom was achieved. It was marginalised by the National Party's shift towards the center after 1990, and faired relatively poorly in the first democratic election in 1994, won by the African National Congress. The DP would establish itself as a more effective party of opposition,Institutions, Ethnicity, and Political Mobilization in South Africa, pages 130‚Äì131 however, and eventually rose from relative obscurity and ascended to the status of official opposition in 1999 under the leadership of Tony Leon, mainly by taking votes from the New National Party, the renamed version of the NP. The party also became kingmakers in the Western Cape province, where it formed a coalition government with the NNP. With a fractured national opposition standing against an increasingly dominant governing party, there was a perceived need to better challenge the ANC. To this end, the DP reached a merger agreement with the NNP and the much smaller Federal Alliance (FA) in 2000. Together they formed the Democratic Alliance. The merger was ultimately aborted, with both the NNP and FA leaving the DA. Many former NNP members remained, however, and the new name was kept. The DP was disbanded after the 2003 floor crossing period, establishing the DA at all levels of government. = Since becoming the Democratic Alliance in 2003 = Logo of the DA used between 2000 and 2008 The party consolidated its status as the official opposition in the 2004 general election, while the NNP collapsed. Having gone into opposition in the Western Cape in 2001 when the NNP formed a new coalition with the ANC, the demise of the NNP made the province a natural target for the party. In the 2006 municipal elections, the DA narrowly gained control of its largest city, Cape Town, in a multi-party coalition. Helen Zille, the executive mayor of Cape Town, then succeeded Leon as DA Party Leader in May 2007. In 2008, she re-launched the party as one that no longer acts solely as an opposition but also as an alternative choice for government. The party also introduced a new logo and a new slogan. Zille said the new DA would be \\"more reflective of our rich racial, linguistic and cultural heritage\\", and emphasised that she wanted it to be a \\"party for all the people\\" and not decline into a \\"shrinking, irrelevant minority\\". The Western Cape was won by DA with an outright majority in the 2009 general election, and Zille became the new provincial premier. In her newsletter, she wrote that \\"winning power in the Western Cape will allow us to show what co-operative governance between local authorities and a province can achieve\\". In the 2011 local government elections, the party won control of most of the municipalities in the Western Cape. In 2013, the DA launched the \\"Know Your DA\\" campaign, in an attempt to try to show that the DA (via its proxy predecessor organisations) was involved in the struggle against apartheid. This campaign focused mainly on the role played by a few key individuals in opposing apartheid ‚Äî particularly Helen Suzman and Helen Zille. The campaign received a certain amount of media attention, much of it somewhat sceptical. The ANC issued a detailed critique of the campaign, focusing especially on Suzman's role in the apartheid parliament. Partially on the basis of this campaign the DA contested the 2014 general election, where it once again grew its support base but failed in its stated goal of winning Gauteng province. In the municipal elections of 2016, the DA made significant gains along with other opposition parties in some of the country's most important metropolitan areas. The DA currently governs Tshwane (including Pretoria, the administrative capital), Cape Town (South Africa's second-largest city and legislative capital) and various other municipalities. In the general elections of 2019, the DA's national support declined for the first time in its history. The party retained control of the Western Cape but with a reduced majority and failed to win Gauteng once again. The conservative Freedom Front Plus made significant gains on the DA in the Afrikaner community. Since the election, the FF Plus has continued to make inroads in former DA strongholds. = Formation and mergers = * 1959 ‚Äì Progressive Party breaks away from United Party. * 1975 ‚Äì Progressive Party merges with Harry Schwarz's Reform Party, to form Progressive Reform Party. * 1977 ‚Äì Progressive Reform Party merges with the Committee for a United Opposition to form the Progressive Federal Party. * 1989 ‚Äì PFP merges with Denis Worrall's Independent Party and National Democratic Movement, to form Democratic Party. * 2000 ‚Äì Democratic Party merges with New National Party and the Federal Alliance, to form Democratic Alliance (NNP and FA later withdrew). * 2010 ‚Äì Democratic Alliance begins absorbing Patricia de Lille's Independent Democrats. * 2011 ‚Äì Democratic Alliance absorbs Ziba Jiyane's South African Democratic Convention.  Ideology and principles  The DA sums up its political philosophy as the belief in an \\"Open Opportunity Society for All\\". Former party leader Helen Zille has argued that this stands in direct contrast to the ruling ANC's approach to governance, which she maintains has led to a \\"closed, crony society for some\\". This formed the basis of the philosophy underlying the party's 2009 Election Manifesto, which seeks to build a society by linking outcomes to \\"opportunity, effort and ability\\". The DA's historical roots are broadly liberal-democratic. During the 1990s, the party remained associated with liberal values, though party leader Tony Leon's support for the reintroduction of the death penalty, the party's controversial 1999 campaign slogan \\"Fight Back\\", and the short-lived alliance with the right-wing New National Party fuelled criticisms of the party from the left. After Helen Zille's election as party leader, the DA has attempted to reposition itself as a mainstream alternative to the ANC. The party's economic policy is also broadly centrist, and supports a mix of high spending on crucial social services such as education and health care, a basic income grant, and a strong regulatory framework, with more \\"moderate\\" policies such as a lower budget deficit and a deregulated labour market. At her 2009 State of the Province speech, party leader Zille described her party's economic policy as pragmatic: > We believe the state has a crucial role to play in socio-economic > development. We are not free market fundamentalists. By the same token we do > not believe that a state, with limited capacity, should over-reach itself.\\" = Current policies =  Crime  In the DA's crime plan, \\"Conquering Fear, Commanding Hope\\", the DA committed itself to increasing the number of police officers to 250,000. This is 60,000 more than the government's own target. The party also announced plans to employ 30,000 additional detectives and forensics experts and 500 more prosecutors, in order to reduce court backlogs, and establish a Directorate for Victims of Crime, which would provide funding and support for crime victims. In addition, the party announced its support for a prison labour programme, which would put prisoners to work in various community upliftment programmes. The proposal was criticised by labour unions, who believed it was unethical and would result in labour job losses. In late 2008‚Äì2009, the DA took a stand against the South African Police Service's VIP Protection Unit, after several officers in the unit were charged with serious criminal offences. The party later released documentation of the unit's poor disciplinary record, and claimed its divisional commander had himself dodged serious criminal charges. The DA strongly opposed the disbandment of the Scorpions crime investigation unit, and similar efforts to centralise the police service such as the nationwide disbandment of specialised Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences (FCS) units. Social development Central to the DA's social development policy, \\"Breaking the Cycle of Poverty\\", is a Basic Income Grant, which would provide a monthly transfer of R110 to all adults earning less than R46,000 per year. The party also supports legislation that would require the legal guardians of children living in poverty to ensure that their child attends 85 per cent of school classes, and undergoes routine health check-ups. In addition, to aid with youth development skills, the party proposed a R6000 opportunity voucher or twelve month community service programme to all high school matriculants. The party also supports a universal old age pension, and the abolishment of pension means tests. Education The DA's education programme, \\"Preparing for Success\\", focuses on providing adequate physical and human resources to underperforming schools. The DA supports guaranteed access to a core minimum of resources for each school, proper state school nutrition schemes for grade 1‚Äì12 learners, and measures to train 30,000 additional teachers per year. The DA continues to support the introduction of new performance targets for teachers and schools, and also advocates a per-child wage subsidy, and a national network of community-based early childhood education centres. Health The DA's \\"Quality Care for All\\" programme is focused on tackling the country's high HIV/AIDS infection rate. Included in these plans is an increase in the number of clinics offering HIV testing and measures to provide all HIV-positive women with Nevirapine. The party's health policy also plans to devote more resources to vaccinations against common childhood illnesses. The party also advocates creating a transparent and competitive health sector, to boost service delivery and encourage health care practitioners to remain in the country. Economy The DA's economic policy aims to create a society in which all South Africans enjoy both the fundamental freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution, and the opportunities to take advantage of those freedoms. In its 2010 Federal Congress booklet, The Open Opportunity Society for All, the party describes this society in the following terms: > Opportunity is the vehicle with which people are empowered to live their > lives, pursue their dreams and develop their full potential. And the DA > believes that the role of the government is to provide every citizen with a > minimum basic standard of quality services and resources with which to be > able to do so ‚Äì a framework for choice. The DA therefore advocates a mixed-economy approach, where the state is involved in the economy only to the extent that it can expand opportunity and choice. The manifesto includes various proposals detailing how a DA government would manage the economy and facilitate growth. The majority of the interventions suggested by the party are aimed at creating an atmosphere conducive to job creation and greater foreign direct investment. The DA has suggested measures to make South Africa's labour market more amenable to job creation. The party has also suggested several targeted interventions to allow for higher employment, especially amongst the youth. These interventions include a wage subsidy programme to reduce the cost of hiring first-time workers. The DA has committed itself to a counter-cyclical fiscal policy approach. This is evident in the party's previous alternative budget frameworks, with both alternative budgets posting deficits. The party defended this stance by arguing that increased spending was necessary to help the economy out of recession. Other fiscal interventions have included a proposed scrapping of value added tax (VAT) on books and tax rebates for crime prevention expenditure by businesses. The DA supports an inflation-targeting monetary policy regime similar to that of the ANC government. It has also repeatedly reaffirmed its support and commitment for reserve bank instrument independence. The DA proposes to incentivise savings by reducing taxes on income earned from fixed deposits that are held for longer than twelve months. The party states that this would help South Africa to boost its domestic savings rate to enable the country to invest in projects that will provide additional job opportunities. The party has rejected the ANC's approach to Black Economic Empowerment, with former party leader Helen Zille arguing that the current policies have only served to enrich a small elite of politically connected businessmen. The party proposed an alternative it calls broad-based economic empowerment, which would provide for targeted interventions focusing on skills training and socio-economic investment instead of ownership targets. The party believes that this approach will give a broader group of black South Africans an opportunity to compete and partake in the economy. The party advocates an active industrial policy that allows the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) to co-ordinate industrial policy. Additionally it would also set up a sovereign venture capital fund to help support innovation in key industries. The DA also supports the creation of Industrial Development Zones and Export Processing Zones. The party suggests that by relaxing certain regulations in these zones, manufacturers and exporters would be able to grow faster and employ more people. This fits into the party's broader vision of growing the economy by cutting red tape and regulations it claims is holding back South Africa's economic growth. The DA has been against the introduction of a national minimum wage, arguing that workers should be allowed to accept a wage of less than R3500 on their own terms. On the other hand, The Presidency stated that the R3500 per month (R20 an hour) minimum wage was still not a living wage, and would only \\"advance the struggle for a living wage\\". Land The DA is resolutely against land expropriation without compensation. This is in response to the ANC and the EFF's recent attempts to change section 25 of the Constitution which deals with land reform. The DA says that changing the Constitution will open the floodgates and undermine property rights, allowing government to own all land and forcing all South Africans to be only permanent tenants of the land. The party says that it is committed to ensuring that those entitled to land receive it in the form of direct ownership, and not as lifelong tenants. The DA's \\"Land of Opportunity\\" programme supports the \\"willing buyer, willing seller\\" principle, though it also allows for expropriation for reform purposes in certain limited circumstances. The party has been critical of the resources that government has allocated to land reform, claiming that government has not been sufficiently active in buying up land that comes onto the market. Though the DA believes this could speed up the pace of land reform, their policies have been vocally criticised by members of the Tripartite Alliance. Land Affairs Minister Thoko Didiza accused the DA of attempting to \\"stifle\\" land reform, while the South African Communist Party contended that the DA's policies overly favoured big business. In a speech at the DA's national congress in April 2018, DA Leader, Mmusi Maimane, praised DA Western Cape Provincial Leader, Bonginkosi Madikizela, for overseeing the delivery of 91 000 title deeds in the province and allowing residents to have full title deeds to their homes. Environment and energy In the build up to the 2009 elections, the DA announced it would create a new Ministry of Energy and Climate Change, to ensure improved integrated energy planning in order to deal with South Africa's growing carbon dioxide emissions. The DA's 2009 environment and energy plan, \\"In Trust for the Nation\\" proposed new measures to increase energy efficiency, and the introduction of sectoral carbon emission targets. Electoral reform The DA broadly supports reforms recommended by Frederik van Zyl Slabbert's electoral reform task-team, that would see the current party list voting system replaced by a 75% constituency-based/25% proportional representation-based electoral system that would apply at national and provincial level. The DA's governance policy Promoting Open Opportunity Governance also makes provision for the direct election of the president, which would give voters a more direct link to the executive branch. The DA believe voting rights should be extended to include all South African citizens who are living and working abroad, many of whom intend returning. Since 2013, South Africans living abroad can now register and vote in national elections.  Electoral performance  thumbProportion of votes cast for the DA in the 2014 election, by ward.

In the Gauteng Province, the first dually elected Democratic Alliance Youth Provincial Executive Committee took office in November 2017 after they were elected at the Gauteng Provincial Congress the same year. It consists of Pogiso Mthimunye (Chairperson), Patrick Oberholster (Deputy Chairperson), Cay- Low Mbedzi (Media and Publicity), Khathutshelo Rasilingwane (Recruitment and Campaigns) and Prudence Mollo (Training and Development). In the North West Province of South Africa, Emi Koekemoer is the elected Provincial Chairperson while Henning Lubbe takes the role as Provincial Deputy Chairperson of Administration, Quinton Booysen fills the role of Provincial Deputy Chairperson of Recruitment and Campaigns, Percilla Mompe is the Provincial Deputy Chairperson of Media and Publicity and Neo Mabote is the Provincial Deputy Chairperson of Training and Development. = Democratic Alliance Women's Network = The Democratic Alliance Women's Network (DAWN) current federal leader is Dr. Nomafrench Mbombo, who is also the current Western Cape Minister of Health. The deputy federal leader is Safiyia Stanfley. According to the DAWN constitution: > DAWN will: * promote the empowerment and development of women and help build > their self-confidence to stimulate and activate initiatives. * promote > amongst women a consciousness of accountability, patriotism and unity. * > promote women‚Äôs participation in every sector of public life. * promote a > healthy culture of the recognition of women‚Äôs rights as human rights. * > oppose violence against women wherever possible.

The DA Abroad is the DA's overseas network of volunteers who are making a difference and contributing to the success of South Africa through projects and campaigns that are aligned with the DA's vision of One Nation with One Future underpinned by Freedom, Fairness, Opportunity and Diversity for All. The DA Abroad is led by DA Abroad Leader Francine Higham, Chairperson Nigel Bruce and Finance Chair Neville Marshall and Global. The DA Abroad has active hubs in the Americas, Europe, Africa, Asia and Australasia. = Democratic Alliance Young Leaders Programme = The DA's Young Leaders Programme (YLP) is a political leadership development programme for South Africans between the ages of 18 and 35 who believe in the DA's vision of the Open, Opportunity Society for All. Participants of the programme are highly motivated individuals, interested in pursuing a career in politics, with a track record of leadership excellence. Over the course of one year, participants of the programme are equipped with an in-depth political knowledge, critical thinking and communication skills and the opportunity to grow their leadership capacity, self-awareness and emotional maturity.  Controversies  =Accusations of racism= Leaders of the DA as well as DA members have been accused of making racially insensitive comments and this has led to disciplinary action. MP Dianne Kohler Barnard was briefly expelled from the party because of statements she made on her Facebook page praising P. W. Botha.http://beta.iol.co.za/news/barnard-has-undone-das- good-work-1927935 In response to these incidents party leader Mmusi Maimane, set out a stronger stance in January 2016 for the DA on the issue of racism, than his predecessor, Helen Zille (who had also denounced racism). Maimane spelled out a charter on racism that all new DA members will have to commit to when they join the party. He also announced that the DA would introduce equity targets when the DA selects candidates for public office in order to make the party more diverse and reflective of the country as a whole. Some of these commitments may have consequences that become hard to manage in the future, as enforcing the pledge could be hard and there could be opposition to equity targets from established potential candidates who may be affected. In response to Maimane's new position, former DA Parliamentary Leader Lindiwe Mazibuko wrote an opinion piece in which she lauded his initiative, but criticised what she called the almost exclusive domination of white men within the DA's 'brains trust', and called upon Maimane to address this as well. The DA denied Mazibuko's claims. In March 2017, Helen Zille, still Premier of the Western Cape, issued a number of tweets suggesting that colonialism was not entirely negative, and faced a disciplinary hearing for publicly opposing DA principles; deliberately acting in a way that impacted negatively on the DA; and bringing the DA into disrepute. The matter was eventually resolved by agreement with Zille apologising for her tweets. = Delft = In December 2007, a local DA councillor, Frank Martin, allegedly encouraged local families to occupy newly built N2 Gateway houses in Delft in the Western Cape. After over 1,000 backyarders from the area occupied the houses, a high-profile political fight between ANC and DA leaders ensued, each accusing the other of racism, playing party politics, and using the poor for their own gain. The ANC along with a number of civil society organisations such as the Symphony Way Pavement Dwellers accused the DA of either instigating or tacitly approving of Martin's role in the invasions. Judge Van Zyl of the Cape Town High Court ruled to evict residents and also faulted Frank Martin for instigating the occupation. Criminal charges against Martin were later dropped. On 18 February 2009, a City of Cape Town disciplinary committee found Martin guilty of encouraging people to invade homes at Delft and was suspended for one month.DA councillor found guilty IOL A further political spat ensued after February 2008 between the DA and the Delft-Symphony Anti-Eviction Campaign, which accused the DA of favouring its party supporters. In response, Zille denied this, and pointed out that the City of Cape Town had responded to the crisis by providing comprehensive services to the Delft evictees. =Patricia de Lille= 2018 saw further controversy with a major conflict developing between the party and Cape Town Mayor Patricia De Lille, resulting in further criticism of party leader Mmusi Maimane. This and other controversies appear to have given rise to speculation about a split in the DA, but this was denied by Maimane. In June 2018, the Western Cape High Court ruled that the DA decision to oust De Lille from party membership was unlawful. In August 2018, De Lille announced that she would resign as Mayor in October 2018. She left office on 31 October 2018 and Dan Plato was designated to be her successor.

Promoting traditional raga principles, Nath exerted an influence on notable American minimalist and jazz musicians, including La Monte Young, Terry Riley, and Don Cherry. He began performing in the United States in the 1970s, and established the Kirana Center for Indian Classical Music in 1972; he subsequently taught in various universities across the US and Europe. Early life Pran Nath was born into a wealthy family in Lahore in present- day Pakistan. While they were avid devotees of music, inviting musicians into the house to perform nightly, his family did not approve of his desire to become a musician, so he left home at the age of 13 and took up residence with the reclusive singer Abdul Wahid Khan of the Kirana gharana, cousin of the more widely known Abdul Karim Khan. Pran Nath served Khan for seven years before he was accepted as a student, and stayed with Khan for nearly two decades. Both guru and disciple were much attracted to mysticism: Abdul Wahid Khan, a Muslim, to Sufism; and Nath, a Hindu, to a Shaivite sect in Dehra Dun. It is said that Nath lived in a cave near the Tapkeswhar temple to Shiva for five years,terryriley.net/india/PranNath.htm serving his guru intermittently. He eventually married and reentered the world at the request (guru dakshana) of his guru, in order to ensure the preservation of the Kirana style. In 1937, he became a staff artist with All India Radio. However, Nath stuck to Abdul Wahid's extra-methodical and austere singing style, with a heavy emphasis on alap and slow tempo, which suited his voice well but was not very popular. Like his teacher, Pran Nath's singing emphasized precise intonation and the gradual, note-by-note exposition of tone and mood in the alap section of the music. Nath supported himself as a music teacher, and worked at the University of Delhi from 1960 to 1970. He was also a visiting professor of music at Mills College. Life in the United States In 1970, Pran Nath travelled to New York to visit the American composer La Monte Young and visual artist Marian Zazeela, who heard his first issued recording, Earth Groove: The Voice of Cosmic India. In 1972, he established the Kirana Center for Indian Classical Music in New York City and lived in the US for the rest of his life. He taught at several universities abroad and in the US, including Mills College, and attracted a strong following among the American minimalist composers, including Terry Riley, Jon Hassell, and Henry Flynt. Alexander Keefe, Lord of the Drone: Pandit Pran Nath and the American Underground Jazz musicians such as Don Cherry and Lee Konitz also drew influence from his teaching.

The MDS was founded by defectors from the then ruling Socialist Destourian Party (PSD) and liberal-minded expatriates in 1978. The founders of the MDS had already been involved in the establishment of the Tunisian Human Rights League (LTDH) in 1976/77. Its first secretary general was Ahmed Mestiri who had been a member of the PSD and interior minister in the government of Habib Bourguiba, but was dropped from the government in 1971 and expelled from the party after he had called for democratic reforms and pluralism. Tunisia was then a single-party state ruled exclusively by the PSD. The MDS remained illegal until 1981 when the more reform-minded Prime Minister Mohammed Mzali allowed oppositional parties to run candidates' lists in elections and announced to officially recognise them in case they won more than 5%. Among the minor, weakly institutionalised oppositional parties, the MDS presented the most appealing candidates list and threatened to actually beat the PSD in the capital Tunis. The government decided to rig the elections. So, according to official results, the MDS won only 3.2 percent, behind the ruling PSD with 94.6 percent. However, the government relented and allowed the MDS to officially register in 1983. It was one of three legal oppositional parties during the 1980s. The MDS welcomed Zine El Abidine Ben Ali taking over the presidency from the longterm head of state Bourguiba in 1987. Many MDS members believed that Ben Ali really pursued reforms and liberalisation and defected to his Constitutional Democratic Rally (RCD), weakening the MDS. Ahmed Mestiri led the party until 1990. In the early 1990s, the party was torn between cooperation with the government and opposition. Those who strove for a strictly oppositional course left the party or were edged out. In 1994, a group of MDS dissidents around Mustapha Ben Jaafar founded the Democratic Forum for Labour and Liberties (FDTL), which was only legalised in 2002. In 1994, the electoral law was changed, ensuring the parliamentary representation of oppositional parties. The MDS received 10 of 163 seats (19 being reserved for the opposition). In 1999, it became the largest opposition party, with 13 seats in the Tunisian parliament. In 2001, the then-party leader Mohamed al- Mouadda was charged with having formed a pact with the banned Islamist group Ennahda. At the 2004 parliamentary election, the party won 4.6% of the popular vote and 14 seats. Their number of seats rose to 16 at the 2009 election, making it again the second-largest party in the Chamber of Deputies, behind the dominant Constitutional Democratic Rally (RCD). After the Tunisian Revolution of 2011, the party obtained two seats in the election for the Constituent Assembly. The MDS has published the Arabic weekly newspapers Al- Moustaqbal (\\"The Future\\") and Al-Ra'i (\\"Opinion\\"), as well as the French- language L'Avenir.

Within the Hornbostel Sachs system they therefore do not have a number (hence the label NaN = Not a Number). =Hydraulophones= The first three Hornbostel Sachs numbers describe instruments that make sound from matter in its solid state. The fourth HS number describes instruments that make sound from matter in its gaseous state (air). The fifth HS number describes instruments that make sound from electricity and/or electrical energy. Recently a number of instruments have been invented, designed, and made, that make sound from matter in its liquid state. This new class of instruments is called hydraulophones. Hydraulophones use an incompressible fluid, such as water, as the initial sound-producing medium, and they may also use the hydraulic fluid as a user- interface. =Plasmaphones= Another category of instruments has recently been invented that use matter in higher energy states, such as plasma, to produce the initial sound. These instruments are called plasmaphones. As flame is matter in a high energy state the class comprises the much older pyrophones. =Non-electrophonic quintephones= A number of computational musical instruments that are not electrophones have been invented, designed, built, and used in performances. These instruments are sound synthesizers that use mechanical, optical, or other forms of non-electric computation, sampling, processing, or the like. It has been proposed that music synthesizers that perform computation, and/or that work by recording and playback of sound samples, or the like, be referred to as quintephones.

On June 23, 2006, Anadarko Petroleum acquired Kerr-McGee in an all-cash transaction totaling $16.5 billion plus $2.6 billion in debt and all operations moved from their base in Oklahoma, United States. History The company later known as Kerr-McGee was founded in 1929 as Anderson & Kerr Drilling Company by Oklahoma businessman-politician Robert S. Kerr (1896-1963) and oil driller James L. Anderson. When Dean A. McGee (1904-1989), a former chief geologist for Phillips Petroleum, joined the firm in 1946, it changed its name to Kerr-McGee Oil Industries, Incorporated. The company initially focused mostly on off-shore oil exploration and production, being one of the first companies to use drillships in the Gulf of Mexico, and later one of the first companies to use a Spar type platform in the area. With the acquisition of the Oryx Energy Company of Dallas, Texas in 1999, Kerr-McGee gained more onshore assets, as well as significant assets in several foreign areas, most notably Algeria and western Kazakhstan. Later acquisitions of HS Resources and Westport Resources Corp. established the base of operations in Denver, Colorado and added large resource areas throughout the Rocky Mountains. Until 2005, Kerr-McGee had two major divisions: chemical and oil-related. On November 21, 2005, the chemical division of the company, based in Oklahoma City, was sold off by IPO as Tronox, thereby making Oklahoma City home to the administrative side of Kerr-McGee, while all exploration and production management was located in Denver and Houston. On June 23, 2006, Anadarko Petroleum, based in The Woodlands, Texas, purchased Kerr-McGee in an all-cash transaction totaling $16.5 billion plus the assumption of $2.6 billion in debt. Kerr-McGee shareholders approved the offer on August 10, 2006 and Kerr-McGee ceased to exist as an independent entity. All operations with the exception of Tronox which was spun off as a separate company in 2005 moved out of Oklahoma. Within a few years, the top positions at Anadarko had been filled by Kerr-McGee employees and many long-time Anadarko employees had left or been removed from the company, effecting a de facto name change for Kerr- McGee.

Navajo Tribe, 471 U.S. 195 (1985), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that an Indian tribe is not required to obtain the approval of the Secretary of the Interior in order to impose taxes on non- tribal persons or entities doing business on a reservation. In 1978, the Navajo Tribal Council passed two taxing ordinances.Wilkinson, Charles F. (1996), Home Dance, the Hopi, and Black Mesa Coal: Conquest and Endurance in the American Southwest, 1996 BYU L. R. 449, Brigham Young Univ. The first was a tax of 3% on leaseholds (such as mineral rights) and the second was a 5% tax on business activity. Kerr-McGee held substantial mineral rights on the Navajo Nation and filed a lawsuit in the federal district court seeking an injunction to prohibit the tribe from collecting the tax. Kerr-McGee argued that any tax of non-Indians by a tribe required approval by the Secretary of the Interior and the district court agreed, granting the injunction. The tribe appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The Ninth Circuit overruled the district court, finding no federal statute or regulation required such approval. Kerr- McGee then appealed to the Supreme Court, which granted certiorari and agreed to hear the case.Kerr-McGee v. Navajo Tribe, . The court decided unanimously that the Navajo Nation had the right to tax Kerr-McGee because tribal authority to tax had already been recognized, and because no federal law prohibited exercising tribal sovereignty in enacting a tax. Locations =United States= Main oil and gas operations in the US were the Mid- Continent, Rocky Mountains, onshore Louisiana, and offshore in the Gulf of Mexico. Main offices were located in downtown Denver and the Greenspoint area of Houston. Corporate headquarters were located in Downtown Oklahoma City. In the 1970s the company had a forest products division, and mineral mining in New Mexico, Arizona, and Idaho, and coal mining in Wyoming and Illinois. Most of the U.S operations were on land owned by the U.S. government (i.e. Bureau of Land Management, National Forest) and the Navajo Indian tribe. Kerr-McGee Tower, a prominent skyscraper in downtown Oklahoma City, served as Corporate Headquarters. =Mainland China= Kerr-McGee had exploration, development, and production projects in Bohai Bay, China, near Beijing. Additional exploration was planned for the South China Sea. These operations were run primarily from an office in Beijing. =Other locations= Kerr-McGee and its subsidiaries formerly operated in western Kazakhstan, western Australia, Brazil, Trinidad, Benin, the United Kingdom and several other more minor locations around the world at various times. Controversies =Exploration in disputed regions of Western Sahara= Kerr-McGee received international criticism for undertaking exploration for hydrocarbon resources offshore the Moroccan controlled area of the disputed territory of Western Sahara in 2001. In 2003, one of Norway's main private investment funds, Skagen Vekst, sold their ‚Ç¨3.6 million stake in the oil company, referring to ethic problems surrounding Kerr-McGee's engagement in Western Sahara. In May 2005, despite the number of growing protests, the company renewed the contract signed with Moroccan authorities until October. In June 2005, the Norwegian government sold the $52.7 million it had invested in the company through the Government Petroleum Fund (one of the biggest investment funds of the world), characterizing Kerr-McGee's contract in Western Sahara as having \\"particularly serious violations of fundamental ethical norms\\". That same month, another two Norwegian private investment funds (Storebrand and KLP) sold their participations on Kerr-McGee, ‚Ç¨1 million and ‚Ç¨1.45 million respectively. On May 2, 2006, the company declared its intention to no longer drill off the coast of the Western Sahara, by not renewing the contract signed with Morocco. =Under-payment of royalties to the U.S. government= On June 14, 2004, Bobby Maxwell, a senior government auditor for the U.S. Department of the Interior's Minerals Management Service (\\"MMS\\"), filed suit in federal court on behalf of the U.S. Government against Kerr-McGee, under the whistle-blowing provisions of the False Claims Act (\\"FCA\\").31 U.S.C. ¬ß 3729. (See also The Royalty Treatment. NOW  PBS, May 11, 2007, retrieved April 22, 2015.) In the suit, Mr. Maxwell alleged that, based on the information uncovered during his audit, \\"Kerr-McGee knowingly made false and/or fraudulent statements on the monthly royalty reports submitted to the MMS and 'understated and underpaid' its federal royalties.\\" Maxwell v. Kerr-McGee Oil & Gas Corp., 486 F.Supp.2d 1217, 1221 (D.Colo.2007) In January 2007, after a full trial on the issues, Kerr-McGee was found by a jury to have failed to report earnings, and thus, under-paying royalties due to the U.S. government. The jury award damages in the amount of US$7.6 million. Despite the jury's verdict, however, before entering judgment, the court reconsidered an earlier Motion for Summary Judgement filed by Kerr-McGee and reversed its prior holding, this time determining that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear the case at all.Maxwell, 486 F.Supp.2d at 1222 The case was appealed by Mr. Maxwell, and on September 10, 2008, the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the ruling of the lower court, remanding it back for further proceedings.U.S. ex rel. Maxwell v. Kerr-McGee Oil & Gas Corp., 540 F.3d 1180 (10th Cir.2008) On September 16, 2010, U.S. District Court Judge Marcia S. Krieger of Colorado ordered Kerr-McGee to pay treble damages, or almost $23 million. As a whistle- blower under the FCA, Mr. Maxwell would be entitled to twenty-five percent of the amount recovered for the government, or approximately $5.7 million. Per Mr. Maxwell, however, most of the money awarded would go to pay the legal fees associated with his almost-10-year fight to force Kerr-McGee to change its deceptive practices and pay what it owed to the public.https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/21/business/energy- environment/21whistle.html?_r=0, September 20, 2010, retrieved April 22, 2015 =Karen Silkwood= It is alleged that Karen Silkwood was negligently or purposefully contaminated with plutonium while working at Kerr-McGee's Cimarron Fuel Fabrication Site and investigating safety violations at the plant. Her activism and November 1974 death were the subject of the 1983 film Silkwood. In a civil suit against Kerr-McGee by the Estate of Karen Silkwood, Judge Frank Theis told the jury, \\"If you find that the damage to the person or property of Karen Silkwood resulted from the operation of this plant, Kerr- McGee is liable.\\"Rashke, Richard L. The Killing of Karen Silkwood: The Story Behind the Kerr-McGee Plutonium Case. 2d ed. Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 2000. The jury rendered its verdict of $505,000 in damages and $10,000,000 in punitive damages. On appeal, the judgment was reduced to $5,000.\\"Silkwood Award Is Reversed.\\" Associated Press. December 12, 1981. In 1984, the U.S. Supreme Court restored the original verdict (Silkwood v. Kerr- McGee Corp., 464 U.S. 283 (1984)).\\"High Court Clears Award in Karen Silkwood Case.\\" New York Times. January 12, 1984. The suit was headed for retrial when Kerr-McGee settled out of court in 1986 for $1.38 million, admitting no liability.\\"Business Digest.\\" New York Times. August 23, 1986. Gerry Spence, the noted trial lawyer from Jackson Hole, Wyoming, represented the Karen Silkwood estate in this litigation. Environmental record Kerr-McGee is at least partially responsible for large scale perchlorate water contamination first discovered in the Lower Colorado River in 1997; It stemmed from land used by a facility in Henderson, Nevada which was owned and operated by Kerr- McGee Chemical LLC (as of 2011 Tronox LLC), where perchlorate was produced from 1945 until 1998. In May 2007, Kerr-McGee Corp spent $18 million on pollution controls in the first comprehensive settlement under the Clean Air Act that reduced harmful emission and conserved natural gas at production facilities across Utah and Colorado. The settlement addressed violations discovered at several of Kerr-McGee's natural gas compressor stations located on the Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation near Vernal, Utah, and in the Denver Julesburg Basin near Weld County, Colorado. In addition to implementing pollution controls, the agreement required Kerr-McGee to pay a $200,000 penalty, and spend $250,000 on environmental projects to benefit the areas in which violations occurred.Kerr-McGee Reaches Major Settlement on Natural Gas Production in Colorado and Utah  Newsroom  United States Environmental Protection AgencyU.S. Environmental Protection Agency In July 2005, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) settled with Kerr McGee Chemical in Henderson, Nevada that required the company to pay $55,392 penalty to resolve air permitting violations at its facility that began in 1993. The EPA cited Kerr-McGee for failing to install carbon monoxide emissions controls required under the Clean Air Act when it installed a new open hearth furnace in 1993. The company spent $4.8 million to install proper pollution controls at the facility reducing total carbon monoxide emission by 115 tons per year, an 80% reduction from previous levels.U.S. EPA settles air pollution case with Kerr-McGee in Henderson, Nev.  Newsroom  United States Environmental Protection AgencyU.S. Environmental Protection Agency Nuclear production Kerr-McGee was involved in several nuclear endeavors.Sources:    In 1952 Kerr-McGee bought the Navajo Uranium Mining Company, including an interest in a number of mines. It also bought an ore buying station at Shiprock, New Mexico. In 1953 it built a processing plant (called the Shiprock Mill) near the buying station. In 1963 the mines and mill were sold to the Vanadium Corporation of America. Later a partnership with other companies was formed called the Kermac Nuclear Fuels Corporation. In 1957-58 this partnership built a uranium mill near Grants, New Mexico and Ambrosia Lake. In 1983 the mill was taken over by a new Kerr-McGee subsidiary called the Quivira Mining Corporation. Quivira was sold to Rio Algom in 1989. Kerr-McGee purchased the Lakeview Mining Company of Lake County, Oregon in 1961. The plant was shut down in late 1960 or 1961 and sold to Atlantic Richfield in 1968. From about 1962-1966 Kerr-McGee processed uranium at its oil refinery site in Cushing, Oklahoma. It received licenses in 1962 for processing uranium and thorium, and in 1963 for enriched uranium. In 1966 it stopped production. An attempt was made to move all regulated nuclear material to the company's new Cimarron facility at Crescent, OK. Cleanups were attempted in 1966, 1972, 1979‚Äì82, and the 1990s In about 1965 Kerr-McGee started producing uranium fuel at its Cimarron Fuel Fabrication Site. This was located near the Cimarron River and Crescent, Oklahoma. From 1973-1975 it would also produce mixed Plutonium-Uranium Oxide (MOX) 'driver fuel pins' for use in the Fast Flux Test Facility at the Hanford Site in Washington State. The plant shut down in 1976.Sources:  In 1967 Kerr-McGee bought the American Potash and Chemical Company, which owned the Rare Earths Facility in West Chicago, Illinois. This facility produced thorium, radium, and uranium by acid leaching of monazite sands and other ores. It stopped work in 1973. In 1968 the company started construction on what would become the Sequoyah Fuels Corporation plant in Gore, Oklahoma. In 1970 the plant started turning yellowcake uranium into uranium hexafluoride. In 1987 it began producing depleted uranium tetrafluoride using depleted uranium hexafluoride as input. In 1988 SFC was sold to General Atomics. In late November 1993 production ceased after a stuck valve in the processing plant stuck open and caused an uncontrolled reaction. The uncontrolled reaction resulted in a large visible cloud leaving the plant. Production ceased immediately and the plant operations were suspended to never resume.Sources:   =Nuclear corporations, subsidiaries, and spinoffs= In 1956 Kerr-McGee formed the Kermac Nuclear Fuels Corporation in partnership with Anderson Development Corp, and Pacific Uranium Mines Co. It was active in New Mexico. Some time in the 1970s, the Kerr-McGee Nuclear Corporation was formed. In 1983 it split into the Quivira Mining Corporation and Sequoyah Fuels Corporation. Quivira got the Ambrosia Lake, NM mine, while Sequoyah Fuels took over the Sequoyah plant in Gore, OK, as well as the Cimarron plant in Crescent, OK. Sequoyah was sold to General Atomics in 1988.General Atomics vs NRC, 1995 and Quivira was sold to Rio Algom in 1989.(technically, GA owned Sequoyah Holding Corporation, which owned Sequoyah Fuels International, which owned Sequoyah Fuels). See General Atomics vs NRC, 1995, footnote 1 The Cimarron Corporation was a subdivision that took control of the Cimarron plant in 1988. When Tronox was spun off in 2006, it would get ownership of Cimarron Corporation and responsibility for the plant as well. Kerr-McGee bought the American Potash and Chemical Company in 1967, including its Rare Earths Facility that processed uranium and thorium. AMPOT became Kerr-McGee Chemical Company around 1970 or 1974. In 2005 this became Tronox. Tronox became independent in 2006, a few months before Kerr-McGee was sold to Anadarko Petroleum. Tronox later went bankrupt, blaming in part the environmental liabilities inherited from KMC. In 2009 purchasers of Tronox filed a class action lawsuit against Anadarko for having allegedly misled investors.Sources:  =Licenses= In the US, nuclear companies must get licenses from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

It was fought between the German Ninth Army and the Russian First, Second, and Fifth Armies, in harsh winter conditions. Eastern Front, September 28 ‚Äì November 1, 1914 Background By September 1914 the Russians had defeated the Austro-Hungarians in the Battle of Galicia. The Austro-Hungarian retreat isolated their fortress of Przemy≈õl, which was besieged by the Russian Eighth Army. The armies on the Russian Northeast Front, commanded by Nikolai Ruzsky, had driven the outnumbered Germans back out of Poland in the Battle of the Vistula River, although the German incursion had postponed the projected Russian invasion into German Silesia. The Russian high command considered how to capitalize on their recent successes. Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolayevich favored an offensive into East Prussia, while his Chief of Staff, Mikhail Alekseev, favored an invasion of Silesia, as soon as they had repaired the extensive damage the Germans had done to the roads and railways on the Polish side of the border. On 1 November, Paul von Hindenburg was appointed commander of the two German armies on the Eastern Front. His Eighth Army was defending East Prussia. It was withdrawn from the frontier to occupy a defensive line. The Russians followed, attacking the line and re-occupying the eastern parts of the province, so its inhabitants fled once again. Hindenburg's Ninth Army, under General August von Mackensen, was on the border between Poland and Silesia. Intercepted, decoded Russian wireless messages revealed that Silesia would be invaded on 14 November. Hindenburg and Ludendorff decided not to meet the attack head-on, but to seize the initiative by shifting their Ninth Army north by railway to the border south of the German fortress at Thorn, where they would be reinforced with two corps transferred from Eighth Army. The enlarged Ninth Army would then attack the Russian right flank. In ten days Ninth Army was moved north by running 80 trains every day. Conrad von Hotzendorf, the Austrian commander, transferred the Austrian Second Army from the Carpathians to take over the German Ninth Army's former position. General Nikolai Ruzsky had recently assumed command of the Russian Northwest Army Group defending Warsaw. Ruzsky had under his command General Paul von Rennenkampf's Russian First Army, most of which was on the right bank of the Vistula River; only one corps was on the left bank. Ruzsky also directed the Russian Second Army, under General Scheidemann, which was positioned in front of the city of ≈Å√≥d≈∫. Both armies were still in summer clothing, and the Russians were short of artillery ammunition. = Central Powers Forces6 Weltkrieg 459 ff. = [North to South] *9th Army [as of Nov. 11, 1914] ‚Äì Gen.

The Russians had no inkling that the Germans had moved north, so they were stunned on November 11 when Mackensen's German Ninth Army struck V Siberia Corps of Rennenkampf's First Army, his only unit on the left bank of the Vistula. The Siberians were routed; 12,000 were taken prisoner. The Siberians were unable to dig effective defensive positions because they had few shovels and the ground froze at night.Buttar 2014, pp. 356-378 The Germans were forcing open a corridor between ≈Å√≥d≈∫ and Warsaw, creating a gap between the Russian First and Second Armies. Scheidemann's Russian Second Army retreated eastward towards ≈Å√≥d≈∫, they were threatened with encirclement. Rennenkampf wanted to support V Siberia Corps by moving more men across the Vistula, but Ruzsky suspected that the target was Warsaw, so First Army remained in place. Grand Duke Nicholas's primary objective was saving Second Army and avoiding a repeat of the disaster at Tannenberg. On 16 November he ordered Wenzel von Plehve's Russian Fifth Army to abandon the proposed offensive into Silesia and to move northward towards ≈Å√≥d≈∫; they marched in only two days. As soon as Hindenburg saw the transcript of this order, he knew that his maneuver had succeeded. Now seven Russian corps were defending the city. Plehve smashed into Mackensen's right flank on November 18 in bitter winter conditions (at times the temperature dropped as low as . The German Ninth Army's right wing was XXV Reserve Corps, commanded by Lieutenant General Reinhard von Scheffer-Boyadel, a 63-year-old who had been recalled from retirement. With Lieutenant General Manfred von Richthofen's, great uncle of the flying ace, cavalry in the van, they were pushing southeast between ≈Å√≥d≈∫ and the Vistula. Part of Rennenkampf's First Army was finally moving east to attack the Germans. Their re-positioning was hindered when a makeshift bridge across the river collapsed, so they had to cross by ferry or on the nearest usable crossing upstream. Once over they attacked the weakly defended side of the corridor extending south from the German frontier to their advancing spearhead. The Russians reoccupied Brzeziny, cutting the roads used by German XXV reserve corps, whose progress south was now blocked by the Russian Fifth Army. Scheffer was ordered to stop advancing, but the order did not reach him. Suddenly it was the Germans who were ensnared in a pocket. Mackensen stopped attacking toward ≈Å√≥d≈∫, turning to help to extricate them. The ecstatic Russians ordered trains for up to 20,000 prisoners, actually the German fighting strength in the pocket was about 11,000, but there were also 3,000 wounded. Other sources state that 50,000 prisoners were anticipated.Strachan 2001, p. 370. Hindenburg was alarmed by the intercepted wireless messages ordering the trains, but Mackensen assured him that they would prevail. In the pocket, Richthofen's cavalry, which had been leading the advance, reversed direction to screen the rear of three infantry columns Scheffer formed along the roads for the retreat back northwest. The frozen, hungry Germans pushed on through the icy night. They reached the outskirts of Breziny unobserved, because most of the 6th Siberian Division were huddling in their sleeping quarters, trying to keep from freezing. The Germans attacked at dawn with bayonets on unloaded rifles and occupied much of the town before a shot was fired. The commander of 6th Siberian Division broke down. Swamped with conflicting accounts of German movements, and with the weather too foggy and the days too short for aerial observation, Ruzsky issued a series of orders, each contradicting the one before. He focused on preventing further German moves south instead of their thrust to the north. On 26 November, XXV Reserve Corps broke out of the pocket, bringing with them 12,000 prisoners, some taken during the breakout, who pulled 64 captured guns. Inconclusive fighting continued until 29 November when at a conference with his front commanders Grand Duke Nicholas ordered his forces in Poland to withdraw to defensible lines nearer to Warsaw. Hindenburg learned from an intercepted wireless that ≈Å√≥d≈∫ was to be evacuated. The Germans moved in on 6 December, occupying a major industrial city with a population of more than 500,000 (about 70% of the population of Warsaw). German casualties were 35,000, while Russian losses were 70,000 plus 25,000 prisoners and 79 guns. Hindenburg summed it up: \\"In its rapid changes from attack to defense, enveloping to being enveloped, breaking through to being broken through, this struggle reveals a most confusing picture on both sides. A picture which in its mounting ferocity exceeded all the battles that had previously been fought on the Eastern front!\\"Hindenburg 1921, vol 1 p. 157. The Polish winter bought a lull to the major fighting. A Russian invasion of Silesia must wait for spring. By this time, the Russians feared the German army, which seemed to appear from nowhere and to win despite substantial odds against them, while the Germans regarded the Russian army with \\"increasing disdain.\\"Buttar 2014 p. 387. Hindenburg and Ludendorff were convinced that if sufficient troops were transferred from the Western Front, they could force the Russians out of the war.Hindenburg 1921, vol. 1 pp.164-166.

History and profile The party was founded in 1981 as a breakaway from the left-wing Popular Unity Movement (MUP) by members who disagreed with MUP leader Ahmed Ben Salah's policy to boycott elections. In 1983, the government of Mohammed Mzali legalised two moderate oppositional parties, including the PUP. The party won two seats in the general election held on 20 March 1994. Following the elections of 1999, the PUP had 7 members in the Tunisian parliament. At the 2004 legislative elections, the party won 3.6% of the popular vote and 11 out of 189 seats. The same day, its candidate Mohamed Bouchiha, won 3.8% at the presidential elections. In 2006, the PUP tried to form an alliance with three other minor oppositional parties, the Social Liberal Party (PSL), the Unionist Democratic Union (UDU) and the Green Party for Progress (PVP). However, the alliance quickly collapsed when some of the participants were accused of pursuing particular interests rather than unity of the opposition. At the 2009 legislative elections, the PUP won 3.4% of the popular vote and 12 out of 214 seats. After the Tunisian revolution of 2011, the PUP participated in elections for the Constituent Assembly, but failed to win any seats. The party has published a weekly newspaper under the title of Al Wahada.

A former member of the Communist Party, he joined the Social Democrats (SPD) after World War II. He served as Federal Minister of Intra- German Relations from 1966 to 1969 and thereafter as chairman of the SPD parliamentary group in the Bundestag until 1983. During his tenure in the Bundestag from 1949 to 1983, Wehner became (in-)famous for his caustic rhetoric and heckling style, often hurling personal insults at MPs with whom he disagreed. He holds the record for official censures (77 by one count, 78 or 79 by others) handed down by the presiding officer. Life Herbert Wehner was born in Dresden, the son of a shoemaker. His father was active in his trade union and a member of the Social Democratic Party. More radical than his father, Wehner engaged in anarcho-syndicalist circles around Erich M√ºhsam, driven by the 1923 invasion of Reichswehr troops into the Free State of Saxony at the behest of the DVP-SPD Reich government of Chancellor Gustav Stresemann. He also fell out with M√ºhsam, whose pacifist manners he rejected, and finally joined the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) in 1927, becoming an official of the party's Rote Hilfe organisation the same year. Wehner rose quickly and was elected to the Landtag state legislature of Saxony in 1930. Nevertheless, he resigned one year later to work at the KPD politburo in Berlin with Walter Ulbricht. After Hitler's seizure of power in January 1933, he participated in the communist resistance against the Nazi regime from the Saar Protectorate. When the Saar was re-incorporated in 1935, Wehner went into exile, first to Paris, then in 1937 to Moscow, where he lived at Hotel Lux, wrote for the Deutsche Zentral Zeitung and had to face Joseph Stalin's Great Purge of 1937‚Äì38.‚ÄûEmigranten: Hotel Lux‚Äú Geo Epoche, No. 38 (August 2009).

Retrieved 15 November 2011 After being sent to neutral Sweden in 1941 in order to re-enter Germany, he was arrested at Stockholm and interned for espionage in 1942. If he deliberately went into custody has not been conclusively established, at least he was excluded from the Communist Party by politburo chief Wilhelm Pieck. Upon his return to Germany in 1946, Wehner joined the Social Democratic Party in Hamburg and soon became an aide of Chairman Kurt Schumacher. After the 1949 federal election he entered the Bundestag parliament and remained an MP until his retirement from politics in 1983, from 1952 to 1958 also as a member of the European Parliament. In 1957/58 and again from 1964 to 1966 he served as deputy chairman of the SPD parliamentary group. Wehner was instrumental in the party's adoption of the Godesberg Program in which the Social Democrats repudiated a fixation on Marxist ideology and broadened its appeal. In 1966 he was named Federal Minister for All-German Affairs in the CDU-SPD grand coalition government of Chancellor Kurt Georg Kiesinger. The cooperation between the ex-communist and the former member of the Nazi Party went well; Wehner even promised the CDU partners to stabilize the coalition by backing the implementation of a plurality voting system, which he later denoted as \\"nonsense\\". Wehner (left), Brandt and Schmidt (right) at a SPD convention in Hanover, 1973 When the SPD assumed the reins of government under Chancellor Willy Brandt upon the 1969 federal election, Wehner became chairman of the SPD parliamentary faction. He was known as a hard disciplinarian who kept his members in line. When the CDU on 27 April 1972 waged a constructive vote of no confidence against Brandt, he ordered the SPD deputies not to participate in the ballot in order to exclude possible bribed dissidents. The opposing candidate Rainer Barzel failed to reach the absolute majority by two votes. After Brandt was re-elected in 1972, the relations between the two men cooled down during the 1973 oil crisis, when Wehner increasingly viewed the chancellor's policies as indecisive. In the course of the Guillaume Affair, he did not make great efforts to persuade Brandt to stay in office and promoted the chancellorship of Helmut Schmidt. Already Father of the House from 1980, Herbert Wehner did not seek re-election in 1983, after the social-liberal coalition had finally broken up. He retired to Bonn, where he died in 1990 at the age of 83 after a long illness, suffering from Diabetes mellitus and Binswanger's disease.

In geometry, a point at infinity or ideal point is an idealized limiting point at the \\"end\\" of each line. In the case of an affine plane (including the Euclidean plane), there is one ideal point for each pencil of parallel lines of the plane. Adjoining these points produces a projective plane, in which no point can be distinguished, if we \\"forget\\" which points were added. This holds for a geometry over any field, and more generally over any division ring. In the real case, a point at infinity completes a line into a topologically closed curve. In higher dimensions, all the points at infinity form a projective subspace of one dimension less than that of the whole projective space to which they belong. A point at infinity can also be added to the complex line (which may be thought of as the complex plane), thereby turning it into a closed surface known as the complex projective line, CP1, also called the Riemann sphere (when complex numbers are mapped to each point). In the case of a hyperbolic space, each line has two distinct ideal points. Here, the set of ideal points takes the form of a quadric.  Affine geometry  In an affine or Euclidean space of higher dimension, the points at infinity are the points which are added to the space to get the projective completion. The set of the points at infinity is called, depending on the dimension of the space, the line at infinity, the plane at infinity or the hyperplane at infinity, in all cases a projective space of one less dimension. As a projective space over a field is a smooth algebraic variety, the same is true for the set of points at infinity. Similarly, if the ground field is the real or the complex field, the set of points at infinity is a manifold. = Perspective = In artistic drawing and technical perspective, the projection on the picture plane of the point at infinity of a class of parallel lines is called their vanishing point.  Hyperbolic geometry  In hyperbolic geometry, points at infinity are typically named ideal points. Unlike Euclidean and elliptic geometries, each line has two points at infinity: given a line l and a point P not on l, the right- and left-limiting parallels converge asymptotically to different points at infinity. All points at infinity together form the Cayley absolute or boundary of a hyperbolic plane. Projective geometry A symmetry of points and lines arises in a projective plane: just as a pair of points determine a line, so a pair of lines determine a point. The existence of parallel lines leads to establishing a point at infinity which represents the intersection of these parallels. This axiomatic symmetry grew out of a study of graphical perspective where a parallel projection arises as a central projection where the center C is a point at infinity, or figurative point.G. B. Halsted (1906) Synthetic Projective Geometry, page 7 The axiomatic symmetry of points and lines is called duality. Though a point at infinity is considered on a par with any other point of a projective range, in the representation of points with projective coordinates, distinction is noted: finite points are represented with a 1 in the final coordinate while a point at infinity has a 0 there. The need to represent points at infinity requires that one extra coordinate beyond the space of finite points is needed.  Other generalisations  This construction can be generalized to topological spaces. Different compactifications may exist for a given space, but arbitrary topological space admits Alexandroff extension, also called the one-point compactification when the original space is not itself compact. Projective line (over arbitrary field) is the Alexandroff extension of the corresponding field. Thus the circle is the one-point compactification of the real line, and the sphere is the one-point compactification of the plane. Projective spaces P for > 1 are not one-point compactifications of corresponding affine spaces for the reason mentioned above under , and completions of hyperbolic spaces with ideal points are also not one-point compactifications.

The line at infinity is also called the ideal line. Geometric formulation In projective geometry, any pair of lines always intersects at some point, but parallel lines do not intersect in the real plane. The line at infinity is added to the real plane. This completes the plane, because now parallel lines intersect at a point which lies on the line at infinity. Also, if any pair of lines intersect at a point on the line at infinity, then the pair of lines are parallel. Every line intersects the line at infinity at some point. The point at which the parallel lines intersect depends only on the slope of the lines, not at all on their y-intercept. In the affine plane, a line extends in two opposite directions. In the projective plane, the two opposite directions of a line meet each other at a point on the line at infinity. Therefore, lines in the projective plane are closed curves, i.e., they are cyclical rather than linear. This is true of the line at infinity itself; it meets itself at its two endpoints (which are therefore not actually endpoints at all) and so it is actually cyclical. Topological perspective The line at infinity can be visualized as a circle which surrounds the affine plane. However, diametrically opposite points of the circle are equivalent‚Äîthey are the same point. The combination of the affine plane and the line at infinity makes the real projective plane, \\\\mathbb{R}P^2. A hyperbola can be seen as a closed curve which intersects the line at infinity in two different points. These two points are specified by the slopes of the two asymptotes of the hyperbola. Likewise, a parabola can be seen as a closed curve which intersects the line at infinity in a single point. This point is specified by the slope of the axis of the parabola. If the parabola is cut by its vertex into a symmetrical pair of \\"horns\\", then these two horns become more parallel to each other further away from the vertex, and are actually parallel to the axis and to each other at infinity, so that they intersect at the line at infinity. The analogue for the complex projective plane is a 'line' at infinity that is (naturally) a complex projective line. Topologically this is quite different, in that it is a Riemann sphere, which is therefore a 2-sphere, being added to a complex affine space of two dimensions over C (so four real dimensions), resulting in a four-dimensional compact manifold. The result is orientable, while the real projective plane is not. History The complex line at infinity was much used in nineteenth century geometry. In fact one of the most applied tricks was to regard a circle as a conic constrained to pass through two points at infinity, the solutions of :X2 \\\\+ Y2 = 0. This equation is the form taken by that of any circle when we drop terms of lower order in X and Y. More formally, we should use homogeneous coordinates :[X:Y:Z] and note that the line at infinity is specified by setting : Z = 0. Making equations homogeneous by introducing powers of Z, and then setting Z = 0, does precisely eliminate terms of lower order. Solving the equation, therefore, we find that all circles 'pass through' the circular points at infinity :I = [1:i:0] and J = [1:‚àíi:0]. These of course are complex points, for any representing set of homogeneous coordinates. Since the projective plane has a large enough symmetry group, they are in no way special, though. The conclusion is that the three-parameter family of circles can be treated as a special case of the linear system of conics passing through two given distinct points P and Q.

This article will be concerned solely with the three-dimensional case. Definition There are two approaches to defining the plane at infinity which depend on whether one starts with a projective 3-space or an affine 3-space. If a projective 3-space is given, the plane at infinity is any distinguished projective plane of the space. This point of view emphasizes the fact that this plane is not geometrically different than any other plane. On the other hand, given an affine 3-space, the plane at infinity is a projective plane which is added to the affine 3-space in order to give it closure of incidence properties. Meaning that the points of the plane at infinity are the points where parallel lines of the affine 3-space will meet, and the lines are the lines where parallel planes of the affine 3-space will meet. The result of the addition is the projective 3-space, P^3. This point of view emphasizes the internal structure of the plane at infinity, but does make it look \\"special\\" in comparison to the other planes of the space. If the affine 3-space is real, \\\\mathbb{R}^3, then the addition of a real projective plane \\\\mathbb{R}P^2 at infinity produces the real projective 3-space \\\\mathbb{R}P^3. Analytic representation Since any two projective planes in a projective 3-space are equivalent, we can choose a homogeneous coordinate system so that any point on the plane at infinity is represented as (X:Y:Z:0). Any point in the affine 3-space will then be represented as (X:Y:Z:1). The points on the plane at infinity seem to have three degrees of freedom, but homogeneous coordinates are equivalent up to any rescaling: : (X : Y : Z : 0) \\\\equiv (a X : a Y : a Z : 0) , so that the coordinates (X:Y:Z:0) can be normalized, thus reducing the degrees of freedom to two (thus, a surface, namely a projective plane). Proposition: Any line which passes through the origin (0:0:0:1) and through a point (X:Y:Z:1) will intersect the plane at infinity at the point (X:Y:Z:0). Proof: A line which passes through points (0:0:0:1) and (X:Y:Z:1) will consist of points which are linear combinations of the two given points: : a (0:0:0:1) + b (X:Y:Z:1) = (bX :bY: bZ: a + b). For such a point to lie on the plane at infinity we must have, a + b = 0. So, by choosing a = - b, we obtain the point (bX:bY:bZ:0) = (X : Y : Z : 0) , as required. Q.E.D. Any pair of parallel lines in 3-space will intersect each other at a point on the plane at infinity. Also, every line in 3-space intersects the plane at infinity at a unique point. This point is determined by the direction‚Äîand only by the direction‚Äîof the line. To determine this point, consider a line parallel to the given line, but passing through the origin, if the line does not already pass through the origin. Then choose any point, other than the origin, on this second line. If the homogeneous coordinates of this point are (X:Y:Z:1), then the homogeneous coordinates of the point at infinity through which the first and second line both pass is (X:Y:Z:0). Example: Consider a line passing through the points (0:0:1:1) and (3:0:1:1). A parallel line passes through points (0:0:0:1) and (3:0:0:1). This second line intersects the plane at infinity at the point (3:0:0:0). But the first line also passes through this point: : \\\\lambda (3:0:1:1) + \\\\mu (0:0:1:1) :: = (3 \\\\lambda : 0 : \\\\lambda + \\\\mu : \\\\lambda + \\\\mu) :: = ( 3 : 0 : 0 : 0) when \\\\lambda + \\\\mu = 0. ‚ñ† Any pair of parallel planes in affine 3-space will intersect each other in a projective line (a line at infinity) in the plane at infinity. Also, every plane in the affine 3-space intersects the plane at infinity in a unique line. This line is determined by the direction‚Äîand only by the direction‚Äîof the plane. Properties Since the plane at infinity is a projective plane, it is homeomorphic to the surface of a \\"sphere modulo antipodes\\", i.e. a sphere in which antipodal points are equivalent: S2/{1,-1} where the quotient is understood as a quotient by a group action (see quotient space).

A wood cut made by Emma Edwall after nature in the mid-1800s. In traditional S√°mi music songs (e.g. KvadThe 12th song from Kalevala V, 395 ‚Äì 402; Friis, J. A. (1871) \\"Lappisk mythologi, eventyr og folkesagn: eventyr og folkesagn\\"; Friis, J.A. and Leudd songs) and joiks are important musical expressions of the S√°mi people and S√°mi languages. The S√°mi also use a variety of musical instruments, some unique to the S√°mi, some traditional Scandinavian, and some modern introductions. Highly spiritual songs called joiks (Northern S√°mi: luohti; Southern S√°mi: vuolle) are the most characteristic song type. (The same word sometimes refers to lavlu or vuelie songs, though this is technically incorrect.) Joiks may have few or no lyrics, do not rhyme, and have no definite structure. They are typically about any subject of importance to the singer, and vary widely in content. In Northern areas each person often has their own joik, sometimes given to them at birth, which is seen as personal to and representative of them, like a name. Purely folk joiks have declined in popularity over the 20th century, due to the influence of pop radio and religious fundamentalism, especially Laestadianism. Joiking first came to prominence within Sweden and Scandinavia as a whole with the 1959 release of Sven-Gosta Jonsson's \\"I'm a Lapp\\", which featured the singer singing about joiking towards heathen stones over a modern, skiffle- like beat. The first commercial recordings of joiking were performed by Nils- Aslak Valkeap√§√§ in 1968, in Finland. Valkeap√§√§'s recordings, however, differed from traditional hoiking by including both instrumentation and ambient sounds, such as barking dogs and the wind. Nevertheless, joik performers of some fame include Angelit (former Angelin tyt√∂t, Girls of Angeli), Wimme Saari and Nils- Aslak Valkeap√§√§ from Finnish S√°pmi. Many modern singers are signed to DAT, the premier record label in S√°mi music. The most famous S√°mi singer is Mari Boine of Norway, who sings a type of minimalist folk-rock with joik roots. Some non- S√°mi artists, including RinneRadio, Xymox, and Jan Garbarek, have used joik and other S√°mi styles in their music. The Finnish folk metal band Sh√°man (now known as Korpiklaani) introduced what some call \\"yoik metal\\" in the late 1990s, drawing attention to S√°mi music in the heavy metal scene. Their music incorporated S√°mi elements such as yoik singing, S√°mi lyrics, and shamanic drum. The vocalist has also yoiked for fellow Finnish folk metal band Finntroll. Also Finnish black metal band Barathrum (On Eerie album's first track) and Swedish black metal band Arckanum have used joik parts in couple of their songs. In January 2008, the S√°mi artist Ann Marie Anderson, singing \\"√Åndagassii\\" qualified to the finals of Melodi Grand Prix 2008, (the Norwegian national selection for the Eurovision Song Contest 2008), but she did not win. In Mars 2015 the Swedish S√°mi artist Jon Henrik Fjallgren came second with his song \\"Jag ar fri\\" in the finals in the national selection for the Eurovision Song Contest 2015. In the October 2018 final episode of the Norwegian televised music contest Stjernekamp, 20-year-old S√°mi artist Ella Marie H√¶tta Isaksen was voted the winner; her final performance on the show was a yoik. Musical instruments Some sources have commented on a supposed lack of musical instruments among the S√°mi, with one 1885 work noting: \\"They cannot claim to possess a single instrument of their own, not even the most primitive.\\" Despite these beliefs, the S√°mi employ a variety of musical instruments, several unique to them. Among these instruments are the fadno, a reedpipe made from Angelica archangelica stalks, and the S√°mi drum. Late 18th century researchers also noted two bagpipes in Lapland: the sak-pipe and the wal-pipe. Other S√°mi instruments of wider Scandinavian usage include the lur (a long horn trumpet),\\"Luren: tolv lappiske og norske viser og sange\\" Abraham Wilhelm Brun, 1900. and the harpu, a zither similar to the Finnish kantele. Willow flutes are often made from the bark of the quicken tree or mountain ash.Carl von Linn√© and Sir James Edward Smith: Lachesis lapponica. A tour in Lapland, Linnaeus (1811), Volume: 2 (p. 51). Modern bands use a wide variety of instruments, especially the fiddle, concertina, and accordion.

Construction and tone Angled barrel of a modern basset horn (German System) Like the clarinet, the instrument is a wind instrument with a single reed and a cylindrical bore. However, the basset horn is larger and has a bend or a kink between the mouthpiece and the upper joint (older instruments are typically curved or bent in the middle), and while the clarinet is typically a transposing instrument in B or A (meaning a written C sounds as a B or A), the basset horn is typically in F (less often in G). Finally, the basset horn has additional keys for an extended range down to written C, which sounds F at the bottom of the bass staff. Its timbre is similar to the clarinet's, but darker. Basset horns in A, G, E, E, and D were also made; the first of these is closely related to the basset clarinet. The basset horn is not related to the horn, or other members of the brasswind family (Sachs-Hornbostel classification 423.121.2 or 423.23); it does, however, bear a distant relationship to the hornpipe and cor anglais. Its name probably derives from the resemblance of early, curved versions to the horn of some animal.Jeremy Montagu, \\"Basset Horn\\", The Oxford Companion to Music, edited by Alison Latham (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 2002). Some of the earliest basset horns, which are believed to date from the 1760s, bear an inscription \\"ANT et MICH MAYRHOFER INVEN. & ELABOR. PASSAVII\\", which has been interpreted to mean they were made by Anton and Michael Mayrhofer of Passau.Nicholas Shackleton. \\"Basset-horn\\", Grove Music Online, ed. Deane Root (accessed 25 March 2011), grovemusic.com (subscription access). Modern basset horns can be divided into three basic types, distinguished primarily by bore size and, consequently, the mouthpieces with which they are played: *The small-bore basset horn has a bore diameter in the range of (still somewhat larger than a soprano clarinet bore, though it is often erroneously thought to be the same; even a large bore English clarinet, such as the old B&H; 1010 design has a smaller bore of ). It is played with a B/A clarinet mouthpiece. Only the Selmer Company (Paris) and Stephen Fox (Canada) currently make this model. *The medium-bore basset horn has a bore diameter in the region of or slightly less. This is the most common type made by German-system manufacturers (e.g., Otmar Hammerschmidt (Austria)). Since no French-style mouthpiece with an appropriate bore is mass-produced, this model requires a matching German basset-horn mouthpiece. (This model is not usually recognized in North America, where it is confused with the large-bore type described below.) Stephen Fox currently makes this model also. *The large-bore basset horn, with a bore diameter of about and played with an alto-clarinet mouthpiece, is in constructional terms an alto clarinet pitched in F and with the extra basset notes. The Leblanc basset horns (bores about ) are of this type. The current Buffet basset horn could be called a hybrid \\"medium-large bore\\" model, since it uses an alto-clarinet mouthpiece but has a bore diameter around . Repertoire A number of composers of the classical period wrote for the basset horn, and the famous 18th-century clarinettist Anton Stadler, as well as his younger brother Johann, played it. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was by far the most notable composer for the basset horn, including three basset horns in the Maurerische Trauermusik (Masonic Funeral Music), K. 477, and two in both the Gran Partita, K. 361, and the Requiem, K. 626, and several of his operas, such as Die Entf√ºhrung aus dem Serail, La Clemenza di Tito which features Vitellia's great aria \\"Non pi√π di fiori\\" with basset-horn obbligato, and Die Zauberfl√∂te, where they prominently accompany the March of the Priests, as well as chamber works. He wrote dozens of pieces for basset horn ensembles. (His Clarinet Concerto in A Major, KV 622, however, appears originally to have been written for a clarinet with an extended lower range, a basset clarinet in A, though there is an earlier version of part of the first movement, KV 621b in the K√∂chel catalogue of Mozart's works, scored for G basset horn and pitched a major second lower, in the key of G major.) The Clarinet Quintet in A major (K. 581) has also been performed on basset horn by Teddy Ezra with other members of the Else Ensemble.Israel Broadcasting Authority, Kol Ha-Musika Etnachta broadcast, 30 May 2016. See http://www.else- ensemble.com/ Other early works for basset horn include a concerto for basset horn in G and small orchestra by Carl Stamitz, which has been arranged for conventional basset horn in F (it has been recorded on this instrument by Sabine Meyer), and a concerto in F by Heinrich Backofen. In the 19th century Felix Mendelssohn wrote two pieces for basset horn, clarinet, and piano (opus 113 and 114). These were later scored for string orchestra. Franz Danzi wrote a Sonata in F, for basset horn and piano, Op. 62 (1824) Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k attempted a half-hearted revival, using the instrument in his Czech Suite (1879), in which he specifies that an English horn (cor anglais) may be used instead, but the instrument was largely abandoned until Richard Strauss took it up once more in his operas Elektra (1909), Der Rosenkavalier, Die Frau ohne Schatten, Daphne, Die Liebe der Danae, and Capriccio, and several later works, including two wind sonatinas (Happy Workshop and Invalid's Workshop). Franz Schreker also employed the instrument in a few works including the operas Die Gezeichneten and Irrelohe. Roger Sessions included a basset horn in the orchestra of his Violin Concerto (1935), where it opens the slow movement in a lengthy duet with the solo violin. In the last quarter of the 20th century and first decade of the 21st, Karlheinz Stockhausen wrote extensively for basset horn, giving it a prominent place in his cycle of operas Licht and other pieces. =Other works= *\\"Dreams and Prayers of Isaac the Blind\\" for solo clarinetist (soprano clarinets, basset horn, and bass clarinet) and string quartet by Osvaldo Golijov; later arranged for solo clarinetist and string orchestra. *Serenade on Carl Maria von Weber's Oberon for basset horn and two guitars, op. 28, written by Heinrich Neumann. *Etudes for Piano and Orchestra, Op. 39 (1992) by Peter Schat calls for 3 basset horns in the orchestra. *Serenade for 12 Instruments, Op. 61b (1915) by Josef Holbrooke calls for both corni di bassetto and oboe d'amore. *Alessandro Rolla ‚Äì Concerto in F Major BI. 528 for basset horn and orchestra *George Benjamin's first opera Into the Little Hill * In his enormous Gothic Symphony Havergal Brian enlists two basset horns. Basset horn soloists and ensembles Suzanne Stephens with a modern basset horn (made by Leblanc, 1974) The Lotz Trio performs on replicas of basset horns made originally by 18th-century instrument maker Theodor Lotz from Pressburg (Bratislava) and Vienna. The ensemble endeavours to follow up with popular wind harmonias from the 18th century. The repertory of the Lotz Trio ensemble is formed by original music called by the German name Harmoniemusik. It is presented predominantly by Mozart‚Äôs music, but the ensemble also performs music by other central-European composers ‚Äì Georg Druschetzky, Mart√≠n I Soler, Anton Stadler, Vojtech Nudera, Johann Josef R√∂sler and Anton Wolanek. The Prague Trio of Basset-horns, based in the Czech Republic, has a repertoire of music originally written for, or transcribed for, three basset horns by composers including Mozart, Scott Joplin, and Paul Desmond. Suzanne Stephens is a leading basset-horn specialist in contemporary music. Starting in 1974, the German Karlheinz Stockhausen composed many new works for her, including a large number for basset horn. Trivia The Italian name for the instrument, corno di bassetto, was used by Bernard Shaw as a pseudonym when writing music criticism.

Death row In 2014, Governor Jay Inslee announced a moratorium on carrying out the death penalty in Washington State.\\"Gov. Jay Inslee announces capital punishment moratorium\\" Retrieved on September 25, 2016. According to Inslee, \\"Equal justice under the law is the state's primary responsibility. And in death penalty cases, I'm not convinced equal justice is being served. The use of the death penalty in this state is unequally applied, sometimes dependent on the budget of the county where the crime occurred.\\" The moratorium means that if a death penalty case comes to the governor's desk for action, he will issue a reprieve. However, this action does not commute the sentences of those on death row or issue any pardons. The majority of Washington's death penalty sentences are overturned and those convicted of capital offenses are rarely executed, indicating questionable sentencing in many cases. Since 1981, the year Washington State's current capital laws were put in place, 32 defendants have been sentenced to die. Of those, 18 have had their sentences converted to life in prison and one was set free. Prior to Inslee's moratorium, Washington's capital punishment law required that capital punishment imposed by the state's courts be carried out at the Washington State Penitentiary in Walla Walla. Procedures for conducting executions are supervised by the Penitentiary Superintendent.\\"Capital Punishment in Washington State.\\" Washington State Department of Corrections. Retrieved on December 19, 2016. Washington utilizes two methods of execution: lethal injection and hanging. Lethal injection is used unless the inmate under sentence of death chooses hanging as the preferred execution method. Within 10 days of a trial court entering a judgment and sentence imposing the death penalty, male defendants under sentence of death are transferred to the Penitentiary, where they remain in a segregation unit [Intensive Management Unit North (IMU-N) at the prison] pending appeals and until a death warrant is issued setting the date for the execution. Female defendants under sentence of death are housed at the Washington Corrections Center for Women in Gig Harbor before being transferred to the Penitentiary no later than 72 hours prior to a scheduled execution, also housed in IMU North, although the execution chamber is located in Unit 6. 78 persons have been executed in Washington since 1904, the most recent being Cal Coburn Brown, in 2010.

History and profile The Progressive Democratic Party was founded under the name of Progressive Socialist Rally in 1983, gained legal recognition on 12 September 1988 and was renamed Progressive Democratic Party in 2001. Under the rule of Ben Ali it was a legal opposition party, but subjected to political repression. After the Tunisian revolution it was one of the major left-leaning secular political forces. It was led by Ahmed Najib Chebbi and Maya Jribi. On 9 April 2012, it merged into the Republican Party. The Progressive Democratic Party had a newspaper, Al-Mawqif. Under the Ben Ali rule In its beginnings, the Progressive Socialist Rally (now PDP) gathered a broad range of currents from Marxists and pro-democracy activists to progressive Muslims. During the Ben Ali rule, Najib Chebbi and the PDP were harassed by the police for years, and verbally attacked by state-run media. After unsuccessfully participating in elections from 1989 to 1999, the party decided to boycott the elections of 2004 and 2009. Therefore, it was unrepresented in the Tunisian parliament. After the Ben Ali administration announced to force the party to move their headquarters from Tunis, its leaders Najib Chebbi and Maya Jribi engaged in a 20-days hunger strike, which earned the party attention and prompted the administration to revoke their decision. After the Tunisian revolution Following the 2010‚Äì2011 Tunisian protests, shootings outside PDP's headquarters were reported on 16 January 2011. The next day, on 17 January, party leader Najib Chebbi, was named Regional Development Minister in the interim government. Ahead of the Constituent Assembly election, the PDP evolved into a main exponent of the centre-left secular camp and rival of the Islamist Ennahda Movement. In the run-up to the elections, the Progressive Democrats have received quite an amount of financial support which enabled the party for a lavish campaign. Critics claim that an important part of the funding came from businesspeople close to the old Ben Ali power elite. In the election for a constituent assembly, the PDP won 3.9% of the popular vote and 16 of 217 seats in the National Constituent Assembly, putting it at the fifth place. As the party had categorically ruled out any collaboration with the victorious Islamist Ennahda Movement, the Progressive Democrats went into opposition and belong to the outspoken critics of the governing coalition of the Islamists with the secular CPR and Ettakatol parties. After the electoral defeat, the PDP launched talks with other secularist and liberal parties to form a \\"big party of the centre\\". title=Premier meeting du ¬´ Grand Parti du Centre ¬ª √† Tunis newspaper=Business News date=7 February 2012}} The merger was realised on the PDP's fifth congress on 9 April 2012.

In 2006, the venue was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. History In 1958, the first Whisky a Go-Go in the United States opened in Chicago, Illinois, on the corner of Rush and Chestnut streets. It has been called the first real American discoth√®que. A franchise was opened in 1966 on M Street in the Georgetown section of Washington, D.C., by restaurateur Jacques Vivien. It owes its name to the first discoth√®que, the Whisky √† Go-Go, established in Paris in 1947 by Paul Pacine. The Sunset Strip Whisky was founded by Elmer Valentine, Phil Tanzini, Shelly Davis, and attorney Theodore Flier and opened on January 16, 1964. In 1972, Valentine, Lou Adler, Mario Maglieri and others started the Rainbow Bar & Grill on the Sunset Strip. In 1966, Valentine, Adler and others founded The Roxy Theatre. Lou Adler bought into the Whisky in the late 1970s. Valentine sold his interest in the Whisky a Go Go in the 1990s but retained an ownership in the Rainbow Bar & Grill and the Roxy Theatre until his death in December 2008. Although the club was billed as a discoth√®que, suggesting that it offered only recorded music, the Whisky a Go Go opened with a live band led by Johnny Rivers and DJ Rhonda Lane, spinning records between sets from a suspended cage at the right of the stage. Early Whisky matchbox. Note the alpha-numeric phone number and French style The Whisky a Go Go was one of the places that popularized go-go dancing. Elmer Valentine, in a 2006 Vanity Fair article, recalled arranging to have a female DJ play records between Rivers' sets so patrons could continue dancing. But because there was not enough room on the floor for a DJ booth, he had a glass-walled booth mounted high above the floor. A contest was held for the female DJ job but when the young winner called Valentine on the night of the opening and tearfully said her mother forbade her from doing it, Valentine recruited the club's cigarette girl, Patty Brockhurst. Valentine quickly hired two more female dancers, one of whom, Joanna Labean, designed the official go-go-girl costume of fringed dress and white boots. Rivers rode the Whisky-born go-go craze to national fame with records recorded partly Live at the Whisky. In addition, The Miracles recorded the song \\"Going to a Go-Go\\" in 1966 (which was covered in 1982 by The Rolling Stones), and Whisky a Go Go franchises sprang up all over the country. Arguably, the rock and roll scene in Los Angeles was born when the Whisky started operation; because of its status as a historic music landmark, the venue was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006. The Whisky played an important role in many musical careers, especially for bands based in Southern California. The Byrds, Buffalo Springfield, Smokestack Lightnin', and Love were regulars, and The Doors were the house band for a while ‚Äì until the debut of the \\"Oedipal section\\" of \\"The End\\" got them fired. Van Morrison's band Them had a two-week residency in June 1966, with The Doors as the opening act. On the last night they all jammed together on \\"Gloria\\". Frank Zappa's The Mothers of Invention got their record contract based on a performance at the Whisky. The Turtles performed there when their newest (and biggest-selling) single \\"Happy Together\\" was becoming a hit, only to lose their new bassist, Chip Douglas (who had arranged the song), to The Monkees; guitarist Michael Nesmith invited him to become their producer (he returned to the Turtles a year later, to produce them). Neil Diamond also played at the Whisky on occasion. Metallica bassist Cliff Burton was recruited by the band after they watched him play a show there with his band Trauma. At one point singer and actress E.G. Daily had a residency at the Whisky. The 15 of February 1977, the Ramones played for the first time on this stage.

The Whisky was located on the strip between the streets Clark and Hilldale. British rockers Status Quo also referenced the venue in their 1978 song \\"Long Legged Linda\\" with the lines, \\"Well, if you're ever in Los Angeles and you've got time to spare / Take a stroll up Sunset Boulevard, you'll find the Whisky there.\\" In 1966, the Whisky was one of the centers of what fans call the Sunset Strip police riots. In the mid-1970s, the Whisky hosted stage presentations, including the long-running show The Cycle Sluts. During the early 1990s, the Whisky hosted a number of Seattle-based musicians who would be a part of the grunge movement, including Soundgarden, Mudhoney, Melvins, Fitz of Depression and 7 Year Bitch. Tracks recorded from a February 12, 1992 concert of Hole appear on their EP, Ask For It (1995). In 1994 Oasis played a controversial set at the Whisky, with frontman Liam Gallagher visibly intoxicated. Immediately following the gig, lead songwriter Noel Gallagher temporarily left the group out of frustration, fleeing to San Francisco, where he penned the song Talk Tonight. In 1997, System of a Down played at the Whisky. The band were unsigned at the time, and played songs from their early demo tapes, in particular containing the band's only live performance of the song \\"Blue\\".

In particular he is widely considered one of the world's leading academic scholars on the works of J. R. R. Tolkien about whom he has written several books and many scholarly papers. Life =Youth= Shippey was born in 1943 in Calcutta, British India, where he also spent the first years of his life. He was sent to a boarding school in England, and studied at King Edward's School in Birmingham from 1954 to 1960. When he was 14 years old, he was lent The Hobbit. Like Tolkien, Shippey became fond of Old English, Old Norse, German and Latin, and of playing rugby. =Academic career= After Shippey's graduation in the early 1960s he did not immediately start an academic career since the British economy of the time did not offer many jobs in academia. Only in the mid-1960s did he enroll at the University of Cambridge from where he graduated with an M.A. in 1968. He was awarded a PhD from Cambridge University in 1970. Shippey became a junior lecturer at the University of Birmingham, and then a Fellow of St John's College, Oxford, where he taught Old and Middle English. In 1979, he was elected to the Chair of English Language and Medieval English Literature at the University of Leeds, a post once held by Tolkien. In 1996, after 14 years at Leeds, Shippey was appointed to the Walter J. Ong Chair of Humanities at Saint Louis University's College of Arts and Sciences, where he did teaching, research and publishing. He retired from there in 2008, and now lives in Dorset. =Fiction= Under the pseudonym of \\"Tom Allen\\" he has written two stories that were published in anthologies edited by Peter Weston. The first published was the fantasy story \\"King, Dragon\\" in Andromeda 2 in 1977; the second was the science fiction novelette \\"Not Absolute\\" in Andromeda 3 in 1978.William G. Contento, Index to Science Fiction Anthologies and Collections Under the pseudonym of John Holm, he is also the co-author, with Harry Harrison, of The Hammer and the Cross trilogy of alternate history novels. In addition to writing books of his own, he has edited both The Oxford Book of Science Fiction Stories, and The Oxford Book of Fantasy Stories and reviews science fiction for the Wall Street Journal.Shippey's WSJ reviews In 2009, he wrote a scholarly 21-page introduction to Flights of Eagles, a collection of James Blish works. Tolkien scholarship In late 1969 or early 1970, Shippey wrote his first academic work on Tolkien. He then delivered a speech at a Tolkien day organised by a student association. This lecture, \\"Tolkien as philologist\\" became also influential for Shippey's view of Tolkien. Joy Hill, Tolkien's private secretary, was in the audience and afterwards she asked him for the script, for Tolkien to read. On 13 April 1970, Shippey received a seemingly formal letter from Tolkien. The two, Shippey and Tolkien, first met in 1972. Shippey was invited for dinner by Norman Davis who had succeeded Tolkien at the Merton Chair of English Language. When he became a Fellow of St. John's College, Shippey taught Old and Middle English using Tolkien's syllabus. Shippey's first printed essay, \\"Creation from Philology in The Lord of the Rings\\", expanded on his 1970 lecture. In 1979, he was elected into a former position of Tolkien's, the Chair of English Language and Medieval English Literature at Leeds University. His first book, The Road to Middle- earth, was published in 1982. At this time, Shippey shifted from regarding Tolkien as a philologist to a \\"traumatised author\\" as he called it. This would include writers affected by war like Vonnegut and Golding. An enlarged third edition was published in 2005; in its preface he states that he assumed that the 1982 book would be his last word on the subject.Preface to the Third Edition. HarperCollins, 2005. Shippey appeared in several documentaries about Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, for which he assisted the dialect coaches. He summarized his experiences with the film project as follows: As an acknowledged expert on Tolkien, Shippey serves on the editorial board of Tolkien Studies: An Annual Scholarly Review. Shippey's education and academic career have crossed paths in many ways with those of Tolkien: like Tolkien, he attended King Edward's School in Birmingham and both taught Old English at Oxford University.

Workers are paid very small sums allowing KCI to undercut conventional businesses. Staffing The department has suffered staff shortages for many years. In 2017, press reports indicated a turnover among the guards of 46% per year. A 10% pay raise increased the hourly wage for uniformed employees to $14.66 but did not include non- uniformed staff. The El Dorado facility was authorized a staff of 682, but about a quarter of the positions were vacant. By 2019, the department was forced to contract with CoreCivic to move six hundred prisoners to Arizona due to staff shortages. At that time, the department reported an overall inmate population of 10,002 indicating about ten percent of the population was to be moved out of state.

At the Nicaraguan general election of 5 November 2006, the party won 25 of 92 seats in the National Assembly. However, the party suffered a devastating loss in the 2011 general election, losing 23 seats in the National Assembly. History PLC mural in Ocotal The Constitutionalist Liberal Party is the political successor of the Democratic Party, a faction which has existed since Nicaragua became independent during the 1830s. After being defeated by the Legitimists (future members of the Conservative Party) in a civil war in the 1850s, the Democratic Party returned to power in 1893 under President Jos√© Santos Zelaya, who lost power in 1909. Under pressure from American troops who had occupied Nicaragua, the Democrats lost power the following year, and remained out of power until 1926 when, following another revolt, they forced the Conservatives into a coalition government. Some factions of the Democratic Party, along with some factions of the Conservative Party, supported Anastasio Somoza Garcia, who gained power in the 1930s, defeating another Democratic faction led by Augusto Sandino, who continued fighting after the 1926 coalition agreement. The Democrats and Conservatives were both marginalized by the Somoza family, who formed the Nationalist Liberal Party, and continued to be out of power when the Somozas were overthrown by the Sandinista National Liberation Front in 1979. The Democratic Party had by this time split into many Liberal groups, many of whom supported the United Nicaraguan Opposition which successfully opposed the Sandinistas in the 1990 elections. By the late 1990s, led by Arnoldo Alem√°n, most of the Democratic/Liberal groups consolidated to form the Constitutionalist Liberal Party, which was at first known as the Liberal Alliance. In 1996 Alem√°n won the presidential election and served as president until 2002, while the party won 42 of the 93 seats in the 1996 congressional elections, more than any other party. At the November 2001 elections, the party gained a majority in Congress, winning 47 of 92 seats. The same day, its candidate Enrique Bola√±os won the presidential elections. Though still a strong force in Nicaragua, there have been many disputes within it since 2001 which, by 2006, had caused it to lose its majority in Congress and the presidency. Bola√±os broke with the PLC to form the Alliance for the Republic. Jos√© Rizo was nominated as the presidential candidate and Jos√© Antonio Alvarado was nominated as the vice- presidential candidate for the November 2006 elections. Eduardo Montealegre, another presidential candidate for the elections, was a former member of the Constitutionalist Liberal Party and formed the Nicaraguan Liberal Alliance which includes other former PLC members. Montealegre and Rizo were both defeated, as Sandinista Daniel Ortega finished far enough ahead of both of them to avoid a runoff. Rizo came in third place with 26% of the vote. The party came in second place in the congressional elections. The party was a member of the Liberal International, but left that organization in 2005.

It is bounded by (from the north and clockwise) the districts of N√ºrnberger Land, Amberg- Sulzbach, Schwandorf, Regensburg, Kelheim, Eichst√§tt and Roth. History '' In early medieval times the region was ruled by the counts of Wolfstein, while the city of Neumarkt was directly subordinate to the emperor and hence independent from the Wolfstein family. In the 14th century the counts of Wolfstein, as well as the city of Neumarkt, became subordinate to the Electorate of the Palatinate, and in 1628 to Bavaria.'' Below an outline of the history of Neumarkt from its founding in the 12th century to its destruction in World War II is provided. The town's development can be divided into 5 periods: The beginnings of Neumarkt The \\"new market\\" is founded on an important long-distance trade route. Neumarkt falls under the rule of the Wittelsbach dynasty and is allotted to the Palatinate on the Rhine with the partitioning of the territory in 1329. Neumarkt as seat of the Palatinate Counts In the 15th century, Neumarkt become the seat of collateral lines of the Palatinate Counts. Count Palatine Frederick II transferred his residence from Amberg to Neumarkt and had constructed a palace. The Reformation in Neumarkt Neumarkt converts to the Lutheran faith. The introduction of Calvinism causes disturbance. ''' The rise of industry in Neumarkt''' Reflecting the general development in Bavaria, the transition of Neumarkt from a country town to an industrial center during the 19th century proceeds rather slowly and in small steps. The destruction of Neumarkt in World War II On 23 February and 11 April 1945, Neumarkt is heavily bombed. The resistance of the SS results in the destruction of the town. The district in its present shape was established in 1972, when the city of Neumarkt lost its status as an urban district and was incorporated into the district.

It tells the story of Jack Skellington, the King of \\"Halloween Town\\" who stumbles through a portal to \\"Christmas Town\\" and becomes obsessed with celebrating the holiday. Danny Elfman wrote the songs and score, and provided the singing voice of Jack. The principal voice cast also includes Chris Sarandon, Catherine O'Hara, William Hickey, Ken Page, Paul Reubens, Glenn Shadix, and Ed Ivory. The Nightmare Before Christmas originated in a poem written by Burton in 1982 while he was working as an animator at Walt Disney Productions. With the success of Vincent in the same year, Burton began to consider developing The Nightmare Before Christmas as either a short film or 30-minute television special to no avail. Over the years, Burton's thoughts regularly returned to the project and in 1990, he made a development deal with Walt Disney Studios. Production started in July 1991 in San Francisco; Disney initially released the film through Touchstone Pictures because the studio believed the film would be \\"too dark and scary for kids\\". The film met with both critical and financial success, grossing $90 million since its initial release and garnering a cult following. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, a first for an animated film. The film has since been reissued by Walt Disney Pictures, and was re-released annually in Disney Digital 3-D from 2006 until 2009, making it the first stop-motion animated feature to be entirely converted to 3D.  Plot  Halloween Town is a fantasy world filled with various monsters and supernatural beings associated with the holiday. Jack Skellington, the \\"Pumpkin King\\" and leader of the town, leads them in organizing the annual Halloween celebrations. However, privately Jack has grown weary of the same routine year after year and wants something new. Wandering in the woods the morning after Halloween, he stumbles across seven trees containing doors leading to towns representing various holidays, and opens a portal to Christmas Town. Awed by the unfamiliar holiday, Jack returns to Halloween Town to show the residents his findings, but they fail to grasp the idea of Christmas and compare everything to their ideas of Halloween, although they do relate to one Christmas Town character; a red lobster-like king who flies at night named \\"Sandy Claws\\". Jack sequesters himself in his tower to study Christmas and find a way to rationally explain it, but cannot. He ultimately decides that it's unfair for Christmas Town alone to enjoy the holiday and announces that he and the citizens of Halloween Town will take over Christmas this year. Jack assigns the citizens of Halloween Town Christmas-themed jobs, including singing carols, making presents, and building a sleigh to be pulled by skeletal reindeer. Sally, a beautiful rag doll woman that is secretly in love with Jack, experiences a vision that their efforts will end in disaster, but Jack dismisses this and assigns her the task of sewing him a red coat to wear. He also tasks Lock, Shock and Barrel, a trio of mischievous trick-or-treating children, to abduct Santa Claus and bring him back to Halloween Town. Jack tells Santa he will be bringing Christmas to the world in his place this year. Jack orders the trio to keep Santa safe, but the children instead deliver Santa to Oogie Boogie, a gambling-addicted bogeyman, who plots to play a game with Santa's life at stake. Sally attempts to rescue Santa so he can stop Jack, but Oogie captures her as well. Jack departs to deliver presents to the world, but the Halloween-styled gifts terrify and attack the populace. While the media sends word via radio about the Santa- impostor, the military takes action and shoots down Jack, causing him to crash in a cemetery. While the devastated residents of Halloween Town think he's been blown up and killed, Jack has survived, and while he bemoans the disaster he has made of Christmas, he finds he enjoyed the experience of scaring the children nonetheless, reigniting his love of Halloween. But first, he realizes he must take action to fix his mess. Jack returns to Halloween Town and finds Oogie's lair. Oogie tries to kill Jack, but Jack rips apart the thread holding his cloth form together, revealing a massive pile of bugs that fall into Oogie's cauldron, apparently killing him. Jack apologizes to Santa for his actions and Santa, while still angry at Jack for ruining Christmas and not listening to Sally's warnings, assures him that he can fix things and returns to Christmas Town. As Santa replaces the Halloween-style presents with genuine ones, the townspeople of Halloween Town celebrate Jack's survival and return. Santa then visits Halloween Town and brings them a snowfall for the residents to play with, which in a way, fulfills Jack's original dream. As he flies away, Santa shouts out, \\"Happy Halloween!\\" and Jack replies by shouting, \\"Merry Christmas!\\". In the graveyard, Jack and Sally declare their love for each other.

He has a ghost dog named Zero, who has a small, glowing jack-o'-lantern nose. Elfman was initially cast as Jack's singing voice and, after the songs were recorded, Sarandon was cast to match Elfman's voice style. ** Elfman also voices: *** Barrel, one of the trick-or- treaters working for Oogie Boogie. *** The Clown with the Tear-Away Face, the self-described clown who rides a unicycle. * Catherine O'Hara as Sally, a rag doll/scarecrow-like creation of Finklestein, and the growing love interest of Jack. She is a toxicologist who uses various types of poison to liberate herself from the captivity of Finklestein. She is also psychic and has premonitions when anything bad is about to happen.

Ivory also voices the brief narration at the start of the film. * Paul Reubens as Lock, one of the trick-or-treaters working for Oogie Boogie. Reubens and Burton had previously worked on Pee-wee's Big Adventure (1985) and Batman Returns (1992). The cast also features Kerry Katz, Carmen Twillie, Randy Crenshaw, Debi Durst, Glenn Walters, Sherwood Ball, John Morris and Greg Proops voicing various characters. Patrick Stewart recorded narration for a prologue and epilogue. While not used in the final scene of the film, the narration is included on the soundtrack album.  Production  = Development = As writer Tim Burton's upbringing in Burbank, California was associated with the feeling of solitude, the filmmaker was largely fascinated by holidays during his childhood. \\"Anytime there was Christmas or Halloween, [‚Ä¶] it was great. It gave you some sort of texture all of a sudden that wasn't there before\\", Burton would later recall. After completing his short film Vincent in 1982, Burton, who was then employed at Walt Disney Feature Animation, wrote a three-page poem titled The Nightmare Before Christmas, drawing inspiration from television specials of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, How the Grinch Stole Christmas! and the poem A Visit from St. Nicholas.Tim Burton, Henry Selick, The Making of Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas , 2000, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment Burton intended to adapt the poem into a television special with the narration spoken by his favorite actor, Vincent Price, but also considered other options such as a children's book. He created concept art and storyboards for the project in collaboration with Rick Heinrichs, who also sculpted character models;Avins, Mimi (November 1993). \\"Ghoul World\\". Premiere: pp. 24‚Äì30. Retrieved on September 26, 2008. Burton later showed his and Heinrichs' works- in-progress to Henry Selick, also a Disney animator at the time. After the success of Vincent in 1982, Disney started to consider developing The Nightmare Before Christmas as either a short film or 30-minute holiday television special. However, the project's development eventually stalled, as its tone seemed \\"too weird\\" to the company. As Disney was unable to \\"offer his nocturnal loners enough scope\\", Burton was fired from the studio in 1984, and went on to direct the commercially successful films Beetlejuice and Batman. Director Henry Selick (left) and producer Tim Burton (right) on the Nightmare Before Christmas set. Over the years, Burton regularly thought about the project. In 1990, Burton found out that Disney still owned the film rights. He and Selick committed to produce a full-length film with the latter as director. Burton's own success with live-action films piqued the interest of Walt Disney Studios chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg, who saw the film as an opportunity to continue the studio's streak of recent successes in feature animation. Disney was looking forward to Nightmare \\"to show capabilities of technical and storytelling achievements that were present in Who Framed Roger Rabbit.\\" Walt Disney Pictures president David Hoberman believed the film would prove to be a creative achievement for Disney's image, elaborating \\"we can think outside the envelope. We can do different and unusual things.\\" Nightmare marked Burton's third consecutive film with a Christmas setting. Burton could not direct because of his commitment to Batman Returns, and he did not want to be involved with \\"the painstakingly slow process of stop motion\\". To adapt his poem into a screenplay, Burton approached Michael McDowell, his collaborator on Beetlejuice. McDowell and Burton experienced creative differences, which convinced Burton to make the film as a musical with lyrics and compositions by frequent collaborator Danny Elfman. Elfman and Burton created a rough storyline and two-thirds of the film's songs. Elfman found writing Nightmares eleven songs as \\"one of the easiest jobs I've ever had. I had a lot in common with Jack Skellington.\\" Caroline Thompson had yet to be hired to write the screenplay. With Thompson's screenplay, Selick stated, \\"there are very few lines of dialogue that are Caroline's. She became busy on other films and we were constantly rewriting, re-configuring and developing the film visually.\\" = Filming = Selick and his team of animators began production in July 1991 in San Francisco, California with a crew of over 120 workers, utilizing 20 sound stages for filming. Joe Ranft was hired from Disney as a storyboard supervisor, while Eric Leighton was hired to supervise animation. At the peak of production, 20 individual stages were simultaneously being used for filming. In total, there were 109,440 frames taken for the film. The work of Ray Harryhausen, Ladislas Starevich, Edward Gorey, √âtienne Delessert, Gahan Wilson, Charles Addams, Jan Lenica, Francis Bacon, and Wassily Kandinsky influenced the filmmakers. Selick described the production design as akin to a pop-up book. In addition, Selick stated, \\"When we reach Halloween Town, it's entirely German Expressionism. When Jack enters Christmas Town, it's an outrageous Dr. Seuss-esque setpiece. Finally, when Jack is delivering presents in the 'Real World', everything is plain, simple and perfectly aligned.\\"Henry Selick, Pete Kozachik , DVD audio commentary, 2000, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment Vincent Price, Don Ameche, and James Earl Jones were considered to provide the narration for the film's prologue; however, all proved difficult to cast, and the producers instead hired local voice artist Ed Ivory. Patrick Stewart provided the prologue narration for the film's soundtrack. On the direction of the film, Selick reflected, \\"It's as though he [Burton] laid the egg, and I sat on it and hatched it. He wasn't involved in a hands-on way, but his hand is in it. It was my job to make it look like 'a Tim Burton film', which is not so different from my own films.\\"David Helpern (December 1994). \\"Animated Dreams\\", Sight & Sound, pp. 33‚Äî37. Retrieved on September 26, 2008. When asked about Burton's involvement, Selick claimed, \\"I don't want to take away from Tim, but he was not in San Francisco when we made it. He came up five times over two years, and spent no more than eight or ten days in total.\\" Walt Disney Feature Animation contributed with some second- layering traditional animation.Salisbury, Burton, p.115‚Äî120 Burton found production somewhat difficult because he was simultaneously filming Batman Returns and pre-production of Ed Wood. The filmmakers constructed 227 puppets to represent the characters in the movie, with Jack Skellington having \\"around four hundred heads\\", allowing the expression of every possible emotion.Richard Rickitt, Special Effects: The History and Technique (Watson-Guptill, 2000), 159-160 . Sally's mouth movements \\"were animated through the replacement method. During the animation process, [‚Ä¶] only Sally's face 'mask' was removed in order to preserve the order of her long, red hair. Sally had ten types of faces, each made with a series of eleven expressions (e.g. eyes open and closed, and various facial poses) and synchronized mouth movements.\\"Maureen Furniss, Art in motion: animation aesthetics (1998), 168 . The stop-motion figurine of Jack was reused in James and the Giant Peach (also directed by Selick) as Captain Jack.  Soundtracks  The film's soundtrack album was released in 1993 on Walt Disney Records. The film's soundtrack contains bonus tracks, including a longer prologue and an extra epilogue, both narrated by Sir Patrick Stewart. For the film's 2006 re-release in Disney Digital 3-D, a special edition of the soundtrack was released, featuring a bonus disc that contained covers of five of the film's songs by Fall Out Boy, Panic! at the Disco, Marilyn Manson, Fiona Apple, and She Wants Revenge. Four original demo tracks by Elfman were also included. On September 30, 2008, Disney released the cover album Nightmare Revisited, featuring artists such as Amy Lee, Flyleaf, Korn, Rise Against, Plain White T's, The All-American Rejects, and many more. American gothic rock band London After Midnight featured a cover of \\"Sally's Song\\" on their 1998 album Oddities. LiLi Roquelin performed a French cover of \\"Sally's Song\\" on her album Will you hate the rest of the world or will you renew your life? in 2010. Pentatonix released a cover of \\"Making Christmas\\" for their 2018 Christmas album Christmas Is Here!. In 2003, the Disneyland Haunted Mansion Holiday soundtrack CD was released. Although most of the album's songs are not original ones from the film, one song is a medley of \\"Making Christmas\\", \\"What's This?\\", and \\"Kidnap the Sandy Claws\\". Other songs included are original holiday songs changed to incorporate the theme of the film. However, the last song is the soundtrack for the Disneyland Haunted Mansion Holiday ride.  Release  The Nightmare Before Christmas was originally going to be released by Walt Disney Pictures and be part of the animation lineup, but Disney decided to release the film under its adult film label Touchstone Pictures, because the studio thought the film would be \\"too dark and scary for kids,\\" Selick remembered. \\"Their biggest fear, and why it was kind of a stepchild project, [was] they were afraid of their core audience hating the film and not coming.\\" To convey Burton's involvement and attract a wider audience, Disney marketed the film as Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas. Burton explained that,\\"‚Ä¶it turned more into more of a brand-name thing, it turned into something else, which I'm not quite sure about.\\" The film premiered at the New York Film Festival on October 9, 1993, and was given a limited release on October 13, 1993, before its wide theatrical release on October 29, 1993. The Nightmare Before Christmas was reissued under the Walt Disney Pictures label and re-released on October 20, 2006, with conversion to Disney Digital 3-D. Industrial Light & Magic assisted in the process. The film subsequently received three re-releases in October 2007, 2008, and 2009.\\"Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas\\", Releases, Box Office Mojo, Retrieved September 18, 2009 The El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood, California has been showing the film in 4-D screenings annually in October, ending on Halloween, since 2010. The reissues have led to a reemergence of 3-D films and advances in RealD Cinema. = Home media = With years of successful home video sales, Nightmare later achieved the ranks of a cult film. Touchstone Home Video first released the film on VHS on September 30, 1994, and on DVD on December 2, 1997. The DVD release contained no special features. Nightmare was released a second time on October 3, 2000 as a special edition. The release included an audio commentary by Selick and cinematographer Pete Kozachik, a 28-minute making-of documentary, a gallery of concept art, storyboards, test footage and deleted scenes. Burton's Vincent and Frankenweenie were also included. Both DVDs were non-anamorphic widescreen releases. Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released the film on DVD again (this time with an anamorphic transfer) and on Blu-ray Disc (for the first time) on August 26, 2008 as a two-disc digitally remastered \\"collector's edition\\", but still containing the same special features. Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released The Nightmare Before Christmas on Blu-ray 3D on August 30, 2011. The release included a Blu-ray 3D disc, Blu-ray disc and a DVD that includes both a DVD and digital copy of the film. In 2018, Disney issued a singalong version of the film, accompanied by the theatrical cut and a Movies Anywhere copy, as a single-disc version for the film's 25th anniversary. = Marketing = Disney has extensively marketed the film and its characters across many forms of media. Since 2001, Disneyland has given its Haunted Mansion Holiday attraction a Nightmare Before Christmas theme for the holiday season. It features characters, decorations and music from the film. In addition to Mickey's Not- So-Scary Halloween Party and Mickey's Halloween Party featuring the film's characters,Ramin Setoodeh, \\"Haunted Parks\\", Newsweek 144.16 (October 18, 2004): 73. Jack Skellington, Sally, Pajama Jack, and the Mayor have been made into bendable figures,Frederick J. Augustyn, Dictionary of Toys and Games in American Popular Culture (Haworth Press, 2004), 18. while Jack and Sally even appear in fine art.\\"New Disney Fine Art: Tim Burton‚Äôs Nightmare Before Christmas Limited Edition by Artist Jim Salvati,\\" TechWhack (November 3, 2008). Sally has been made into an action figure and a Halloween costume.For an image of a Sally costume, see Bobwilson, \\"Halloween gives teens a chance to scare, be silly ,\\" Lubbock Avalanche-Journal (October 31, 2008). A Jack Skellington figurine is available for the Disney Infinity video game, allowing the character to be playable in the game's \\"Toy Box Mode\\". Jack is the titular character in the short story \\"Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas: Jack's Story\\",tk, \\"Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas: Jack's story\\", Disney Scary Storybook Collection (New York: Disney Press, 2003.), 5. and also appeared in HalloWishes and Halloween Screams fireworks at Magic Kingdom (where the host is Ghost Host) and Disneyland (where the host is Jack himself). Nightmare has inspired video game spin-offs, including Oogie's Revenge and The Pumpkin King, and is among the many Disney-owned franchises that contribute to the mythology of the Kingdom Hearts series. A trading card game is also available.  Reception  = Box office = Around the release of the film, Hoberman was quoted, \\"I hope Nightmare goes out and makes a fortune. If it does, great. If it doesn't, that doesn't negate the validity of the process. The budget was less than any Disney blockbuster so it doesn't have to earn Aladdin-sized grosses to satisfy us.\\" The film earned $50 million in the United States in its initial theatrical run and was regarded as a moderate \\"sleeper hit\\". The Nightmare Before Christmas made an additional $11.1 million in box office gross in its 2006 reissue. The 2007, 2008 and 2009 reissues earned $15.8 million and $2.5 million, respectively, increasing the film's total box office gross to $89.1 million. = Critical response = The film initially received positive reviews from critics and it has since gone on to receive widespread critical acclaim, with critics and audiences praising the originality and creativity on the visual and storytelling elements, soundtrack, characters and innovating use of stop-motion animation (particularly most of the effects). On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of 95%, based on 95 reviews, with an average rating of 8.27/10. The site's consensus reads, \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas is a stunningly original and visually delightful work of stop-motion animation.\\" On Metacritic the film has a score of 82 out of 100, based on 30 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B+ on scale of A+ to F. Roger Ebert gave a highly positive review for Nightmare. Ebert believed the film's visual effects were as revolutionary as Star Wars, taking into account that Nightmare was \\"filled with imagination that carries us into a new world\\". Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called it a restoration of \\"originality and daring to the Halloween genre. This dazzling mix of fun and fright also explodes the notion that animation is kid stuff. ‚Ä¶ It's 74 minutes of timeless movie magic.\\" James Berardinelli stated \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas has something to offer just about everyone. For the kids, it's a fantasy celebrating two holidays. For the adults, it's an opportunity to experience some light entertainment while marveling at how adept Hollywood has become at these techniques. There are songs, laughs, and a little romance. In short, The Nightmare Before Christmas does what it intends to: entertain.\\" Desson Thomson of The Washington Post enjoyed the film's similarities to the writings of Oscar Wilde and the Brothers Grimm, as well as The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and other German Expressionist films. Michael A. Morrison discusses the influence of Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas! on the film, writing that Jack parallels the Grinch and Zero parallels Max, the Grinch's dog.Michael A. Morrison, Trajectories of the Fantastic: Selected Essays from the Fourteenth International Conference on the Fantastic in the Arts (Greenwood Publishing Group, 1997), 154. Philip Nel writes that the film \\"challenges the wisdom of adults through its trickster characters\\", contrasting Jack as a \\"good trickster\\" with Oogie Boogie, whom he also compares with Seuss' Dr. Terwilliker as a bad trickster.Philip Nel, Dr. Seuss: American Icon (Continuum International Publishing Group, 2004), 95 . Entertainment Weekly reports that fan reception of these characters borders on obsession, profiling Laurie and Myk Rudnick, a couple whose \\"degree of obsession with [the] film is so great that ‚Ä¶ they named their son after the real-life person that a character in the film is based on.\\"\\"Obsessive Fans of the Week!\\" in Entertainment Weekly 909 (12/1/2006): 6. This enthusiasm for the characters has also been profiled as having spread beyond North America to Japan.Stephen Jones, The Mammoth Book of Best New Horror (Carroll & Graf Publishers, 2002), 75. Yvonne Tasker notes \\"the complex characterization seen in The Nightmare Before Christmas\\".Yvonne Tasker, Fifty Contemporary Filmmakers (Routledge, 2002), 76 . Danny Elfman was worried the characterization of Oogie Boogie would be considered racist by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Elfman's predictions came true; however, director Henry Selick stated the character was inspired by the Betty Boop cartoon The Old Man of the Mountain. \\"Cab Calloway would dance his inimitable jazz dance and sing 'Minnie the Moocher' or 'Old Man of the Mountain', and they would rotoscope him, trace him, turn him into a cartoon character, often transforming him into an animal, like a walrus,\\" Selick continued. \\"I think those are some of the most inventive moments in cartoon history, in no way racist, even though he was sometimes a villain. We went with Ken Page, who is a black singer, and he had no problem with it\\". = Accolades = The film was nominated for both the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects and the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation. Nightmare won the Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Film, while Elfman won Best Music. Selick and the animators were also nominated for their work. Elfman was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score. Most recently, the film ranked #1 on Rotten Tomatoes' \\"Top 25 Best Christmas Movies\\" list.  Possible sequel  In 2001, Disney began to consider producing a sequel, but rather than using stop motion, Disney wanted to use computer animation. Burton convinced Disney to drop the idea. \\"I was always very protective of Nightmare not to do sequels or things of that kind,\\" Burton explained. \\"You know, Jack visits Thanksgiving world or other kinds of things just because I felt the movie had a purity to it and the people that like it, because it's a mass- market kind of thing, it was important to kind of keep that purity of it.\\" The 2004 video game The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge did serve as a sequel of the film, with Capcom's crew of developers going after Burton for advice and having the collaboration of the film's art director, Deane Taylor. In 2009, Selick said he would do a film sequel if he and Burton could create a good story for it. In February 2019, it was reported that a new Nightmare Before Christmas film was in the works, with Disney considering either a stop- motion sequel or live-action remake. In October 2019, Chris Sarandon expressed interest on reprising his role as Jack Skellington if a sequel film ever materializes.  Related media  A collectible card game based on the film called The Nightmare Before Christmas TCG was released in 2005 by NECA. The game was designed by Quixotic Games founder Andrew Parks and Zev Shlasinger. It consists of a Premiere set and 4 Starter Decks based on four characters, Jack Skellington, the Mayor, Oogie Boogie, and Doctor Finklestein. Each Starter Deck contains a rule book, a Pumpkin King card, a Pumpkin Points card, and a 48-card deck. The game has four card types: Characters, Locales, Creations, and Surprises. The Cards' rarities are separated into four categories: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Ultra Rare. Quixotic Games also developed The Nightmare Before Christmas Party Game that was released in 2007 by NECA. A collector's edition The Nightmare Before Christmas-themed Jenga game was issued with orange, purple and black blocks with Jack Skellington heads on them. The set comes in a coffin-shaped box instead of the normal rectangular box. A 168-card Munchkin Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas-themed Munchkin was developed by USAopoly featuring the citizens of Halloween Town such as Jack Skellington, Oogie Boogie, Doctor Finklestein, and Lock, Shock and Barrel. The game comes with a custom die similar to the ones used by Oogie Boogie in the film. A live concert, produced by Disney Concerts, was held at the Hollywood Bowl in October 2015, and was followed by subsequent performances in 2016 and 2018. The shows featured Elfman, O'Hara, and Page reprising their roles from the film. In December 2019 this show came to Europe with dates in Edinburgh, Glasgow, London and Dublin. A one-night-only virtual benefit concert presentation of the film, presented by The Actors Fund and produced by James Monroe Iglehart with the cooperation of Burton, Elfman, Disney and Actors' Equity Association, will stream on October 31, 2020. 100% of the proceeds will benefit the Lymphoma Research Foundation, as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the performing arts. The cast will include Iglehart as Oogie Boogie, along with Rafael Casal as Jack Skellington, Adrienne Warren as Sally, Danny Burstein as Santa Claus, Nik Walker as Lock, Lesli Margherita as Shock and Rob McClure as Barrel. Rounding out the cast are Kathryn Allison, Jenni Barber, Erin Elizabeth Clemons, Fergie L. Phillipe, Jawan M. Jackson and Brian Gonzalez.https://deadline.com/2020/10/nightmare- before-christmas-benefit-concert-broadway-james-monroe-iglehart-adrienne- warren-danny-elfman-tim-burton-1234593007/https://ew.com/theater/the- nightmare-before-christmas-virtual-benefit-concert/  See also  * List of ghost films  Notes  # The Nightmare Before Christmas was reissued as a Walt Disney Pictures release in 2006.

History In 1875, the firm of N. Corah and Sons of Leicester had registered the St Margaret brand for their hosiery products. The name originated because their factory, which became one of the largest hosiery factories in Europe, was in the parish of St Margaret's in Leicester. In 1926 Corahs entered into an agreement to supply Marks and Spencer directly rather than through a wholesaler. This had the potential to bring them into conflict with the Wholesale Textile Association. In order to protect their other distribution channels Corahs sought to develop an alternative brand name for their goods sold through Marks and Spencer. The name agreed by Simon Marks was St Michael, possibly after his father and co-founder of Marks & Spencer, Michael Marks but also because it was clearly linked in the public mind with the St Margaret brand which had a reputation for quality. The name was introduced in 1927 and originally applied only to products produced by Corahs but by 1950 and for the next fifty years, virtually all goods in Marks and Spencers were sold under the St Michael brand. The St Michael name was adopted as a 'quality guarantee' and appeared as the St Michael Quality Promise on the back of food products, on the side of delivery vehicles and on in-store ordering receipts.

After a short period as a Member of Parliament, he served as British Ambassador to the Kingdom of Naples from 1764 to 1800. He studied the volcanoes Vesuvius and Etna, becoming a Fellow of the Royal Society and recipient of the Copley Medal. His second wife was Emma Hamilton, famed as Horatio Nelson's mistress. Early life and career Hamilton was born on 13 December 1730Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (or 12 January 1731)Other sources give his birth as 12 January 1731, according to the baptismal register cited by the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. in either London or at Park Place, Berkshire, the fourth son of Lord Archibald Hamilton, governor of Jamaica, seventh son of William Douglas-Hamilton, Earl of Selkirk, by the 3rd Duchess of Hamilton, and Lady Jane Hamilton, daughter of James Hamilton, 6th Earl of Abercorn.Constantine 2001: 1‚Äì2. His mother was a favourite, and possibly a mistress, of the Prince of Wales and William grew up with his son George III, who would call him his \\"foster brother\\". At age nine, he went to Westminster School, where he made lifelong friends of Frederick Hervey and David Murray. Hamilton used to say that he was born with an ancient name and a thousand pounds; as a younger son he would have to make his own way in life.Fothergill 1969: 21. So, six weeks after his sixteenth birthday, he was commissioned into the 3rd Foot Guards as an ensign.Constantine 2001: 4. He spent some time with the regiment in the Netherlands, and advanced to lieutenant in 1753. In September 1757 he was present as aide-de-camp to General Henry Seymour Conway at the abortive attack on Rochefort.Constantine 2001: 7‚Äì9. The following year he left the Army, after having married Catherine Barlow, the daughter of Hugh Barlow, Member of Parliament for Pembroke Boroughs. The couple shared a love of music, and the marriage, which lasted until Catherine's death on 25 August 1782, was a happy one. There were no children. When Catherine's father died in 1763 she inherited his estates in Wales and these provided the Hamiltons with a steady income.Constantine 2001: 10‚Äì11. In 1761 Hamilton entered Parliament as Member for Midhurst. When he heard that the ambassador to the court of Naples, Sir James Gray, was likely to be promoted to Madrid, Hamilton expressed an interest in the position, and was duly appointed in 1764.Constantine 2001: 12. Naples David Allan Hamilton arrived in Naples on 17 November 1764Acton 1957: 119. with the official title of Envoy Extraordinary to the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies and would remain as ambassador to the court of Ferdinand and Maria Carolina until 1800, although from November 1798 he was based in Palermo, the court having moved there when Naples was threatened by the French Army. As ambassador, Hamilton was expected to send reports back to the Secretary of State every ten days or so, to promote Britain's commercial interests in Naples, and to keep open house for English travellers to Naples.Constantine 2001: 22‚Äì26. These official duties left him plenty of time to pursue his interests in art, antiquities, and music, as well as developing new interests in volcanoes and earthquakes. Catherine, who had never enjoyed good health, began to recover in the mild climate of Naples. Their main residence was the Palazzo Sessa, where they hosted official functions and where Hamilton housed his growing collection of paintings and antiquities; they also had a small villa on the seashore at Posillipo (later it would be called Villa Emma), a house at Portici, Villa Angelica, from where he could study Mount Vesuvius, and a house at Caserta near the Royal Palace. =Vases= A replica of the Portland Vase by Josiah Wedgwood in the V&A; Hamilton began collecting Greek vases and other antiquities as soon as he arrived in Naples, obtaining them from dealers or other collectors, or even opening tombs himself.Constantine 2001: 32.When Goethe visited Hamilton and saw his collection of antiquities in June 1787, he commented on a pair of candelabra and suggested that they had been smuggled from Pompei (E. Lazer, 2009, Resurrecting Pompeii. Routledge: p. 7). In 1766‚Äì67 he published a volume of engravings of his collection entitled Collection of Etruscan, Greek, and Roman antiquities from the cabinet of the Honble. Wm. Hamilton, His Britannick Maiesty's envoy extraordinary at the Court of Naples. The text was written by d'Hancarville with contributions by Johann Winckelmann. A further three volumes were produced in 1769‚Äì76.Constantine 2001: 39‚Äì44. During his first leave in 1771 Hamilton arranged the sale of his collection to the British Museum for ¬£8,410.Hoock 2010: 207. Josiah Wedgwood the potter drew inspiration from the reproductions in Hamilton's volumes. During this first leave, in January 1772, Hamilton became a Knight of the Order of the Bath and the following month was elected Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries.Constantine 2001: 63‚Äì66. In 1777, during his second leave to England, he became a member of the Society of Dilettanti. When Hamilton returned to England for a third period of leave, in 1783‚Äì84, he brought with him a Roman glass vase, which had once belonged to the Barberini family and which later became known as the Portland Vase. Hamilton had bought it from a dealer and sold it to the Duchess of Portland. The cameo work on the vase again served as inspiration to Josiah Wedgwood, this time for his jasperware. The vase was eventually bought by the British Museum.Constantine 2001: 126. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1792. In 1798, as Hamilton was about to leave Naples, he packed up his art collection and a second vase collection and sent them back to England. A small part of the second vase collection went down with off the Scilly Isles.In 1974, the site of the wreck was located, and some fragments of Sir William's vases were retrieved; they were reassembled by Nigel Williams, conservator at the British Museum. The surviving part of the second collection was catalogued for sale at auction at Christie's when at the eleventh hour Thomas Hope stepped in and purchased the collection of mostly South Italian vases. =Volcanoes= An illustration by Pietro Fabris in Hamilton's Campi Phlegraei Soon after Hamilton arrived in Naples, Mount Vesuvius began to show signs of activity and in the summer of 1766 he sent an account of an eruption, together with drawings and samples of salts and sulphurs, to the Royal Society in London. On the strength of this paper he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. In the autumn of 1767 there was an even greater eruption and again Hamilton sent a report to the Royal Society. The two papers were published as an article in the Society's journal Philosophical Transactions.Constantine 2001: 35‚Äì39.W. Hamilton, 1768. An account of the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, in 1767. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London 58: 1‚Äì14. The Royal Society awarded him the Copley Medal in 1770 for his paper, \\"An Account of a Journey to Mount Etna\\". In 1772 he published his writings on both volcanoes in a volume called Observations on Mount Vesuvius, Mount Etna, and other volcanos. This was followed in 1776 by a collection of his letters on volcanoes, entitled Campi Phlegraei (Flaming fields, the name given by the Ancients to the area around Naples). The volume was illustrated by Pietro Fabris. Hamilton was also interested in earthquakes. He visited Calabria and Messina after the earthquake of 1783 and wrote a paper for the Royal Society.Constantine 2001: 118‚Äì19. =Music= The Hamiltons gave musical entertainments in which they played (William the violin, and Catherine the harpsichord or pianoforte) with some of their servants or professional musicians.Constantine 2001: 56‚Äì57. During their tour of Italy in 1770, the young Mozart and his father were introduced to the Hamiltons. Catherine played the harpsichord for Mozart, and he said he found her performance \\"uncommonly moving\\".Constantine 2001: 57. Another musical visitor was the music historian Charles Burney, who stayed at Villa Angelica at Portici and was helped by Hamilton with his research. Burney thought that Catherine Hamilton was the best harpsichord player in Naples.Fothergill 1969: 62‚Äì63. When the young Irish singer Michael Kelly arrived in Naples, he was introduced to the Court by Hamilton.Fothergill 1969: 154‚Äì155. The young Irish composer Thomas Carter also stayed with him around 1788.Roger Fiske: \\"Carter, Thomas\\", in The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, ed. Stanley Sadie (London: Macmillan, 1980), vol. 3, p. 837. Catherine Hamilton died in August 1782; her body was returned to Britain for burial in the Barlow vault at the old Slebech parish church. Hamilton wrote to his niece Mary: \\"I must for ever feel the loss of the most amiable the most gentle and virtuous companion that ever man was blessed with\\".Constantine 2001: 114‚Äì15. =Second marriage= Miniature of Sir William Hamilton, 1784, Scottish National Portrait Gallery A year after his wife's death Hamilton had a third period of leave in Britain. This time he visited his estates in Wales and went on a trip to Scotland with his nephew Charles Greville, who was a younger son of the Earl of Warwick and Hamilton's sister Elizabeth. When Hamilton made a will during that visit to Britain he made Greville his heir.Fothergill 1969: 210. In London, Hamilton met Emma Hart who at that time was Greville's mistress. On his return to Naples, Hamilton was lonely. \\"After having lived 22 years en famille it is most terrible to live chiefly alone\\", he wrote to his niece.Constantine 2001: 146. Meanwhile, Greville, who wanted to search for a wealthy wife, was hatching a plan to persuade his uncle to take Emma off his hands.Constantine 2001: 137. Greville never did marry. Somewhat reluctantly Hamilton agreed to the plan and Emma arrived in Naples on her 21st birthday, 26 April 1786. With her was her mother, who went by the name of Mrs Cadogan, and who would live with Emma and Hamilton until she died in 1810. The women were installed in an apartment in the Palazzo Sessa, and provided with a carriage and wardrobes. Tutors were hired to give Emma lessons in Italian and singing. It was some months though before Emma accepted the fact that Greville was not going to join her in Naples or send for her to go back to England. At that point she decided to become Hamilton's mistress.Constantine 2001: 148‚Äì53. Hamilton and Emma married five years later, when Hamilton obtained leave of three months in Britain. As he held a public position he had to ask the King's permission. The ceremony was a quiet one in St Marylebone parish church, taking place on 6 September 1791, two days before the couple's return to Naples. Emma signed the register as Amy Lyons; the witnesses were Hamilton's cousin the Marquess of Abercorn and Louis Dutens, who had been chaplain at Turin.Constantine 2001: 181‚Äì2. The following day Hamilton was sworn of the Privy Council in 1791. For most of Hamilton's time as ambassador, Naples had been a political backwater. But when France declared war on Britain in 1793 events in Naples became more turbulent, and Hamilton's role became more important, just as his health was declining. Nelson's fleet arrived in the Bay of Naples after defeating the French Fleet at the Battle of the Nile in August 1798 and Nelson was a guest of the Hamiltons. At the end of the year the King and Queen abandoned Naples as the French Army advanced and fled to Palermo in Sicily. The Hamiltons went with them.Constantine 2001: 218‚Äì21. Later life In A Cognocenti contemplating ye Beauties of ye Antique (1801), by James Gillray In the summer of 1799 Naples was recaptured from the French and savage reprisals were enacted against those who had supported the Parthenopean Republic. Hamilton, together with the king and queen, and Nelson, remained in Palermo, except for a visit to the Bay of Naples in when he briefly went ashore. Hamilton was anxious to return to Britain. At the beginning of 1800 Sir Arthur Paget was sent out to replace him and the Hamiltons and Nelson returned overland to England. By this time Emma and Nelson were lovers.Constantine 2001: 242‚Äì45. They landed at Great Yarmouth on 31 October 1800. The relationship between Hamilton, Emma and Nelson was already causing a scandal and Hamilton was caricatured in cartoons by James Gillray. Hamilton would live in retirement for another two and a half years, at Merton with Emma, Nelson, and Mrs Cadogan, and in a house he leased in Piccadilly. He spent his time fishing on the River Thames, visiting his estates in Wales, selling paintings and vases, trying to get money owed to him by the government for his expenses in Naples, and attending his clubs, especially the Royal Society and the Dilettanti. He died on 6 April 1803 at his house in Piccadilly. He left Emma ¬£800 a year, which included ¬£100 a year for her mother, and small annuities for four servants in Naples. His estates in Wales, which were heavily mortgaged, were left to Greville. Nelson was left an enamel copy of a portrait of Emma by √âlisabeth Vig√©e le Brun.Constantine 2001: 283. Hamilton was buried beside his first wife at Slebech. Homage Rock Island with models of Vesuvius and Hamilton's villa Hamilton's life was fictionalised by Susan Sontag in her novel The Volcano Lover: A Romance. In the 1941 movie That Hamilton Woman, the role of Sir William Hamilton was portrayed by Alan Mowbray. In the Dessau-W√∂rlitz Garden Realm in Germany there is an island in a lake atop which is a model of Mount Vesuvius. Duke Leopold III of Anhalt-Dessau would stage fireworks that seemed to issue from an erupting volcano to entertain his guests. At the foot of the mountain on the island is a building intended to suggest Hamilton's villa at Posillipo.

It was created in 1789 by Sir Benjamin Thompson (1753‚Äì1814), later Count Rumford (Reichsgraf von Rumford), for Prince Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria. Thompson's successors, Reinhard von Werneck (1757‚Äì1842) and Friedrich Ludwig von Sckell (1750‚Äì1823), advisers on the project from its beginning, both extended and improved the park. With an area of (370 ha or 910 acres), the Englischer Garten is one of the world's largest urban public parks. The name refers to its English garden form of informal landscape, a style popular in England from the mid-18th century to the early 19th century and particularly associated with Capability Brown. History =Creation= Autumn foliage in English Garden When the Elector of Bavaria Maximilian III Joseph, the last ruler from the Bavarian branch of the Wittelsbach dynasty, died childless in 1777, his throne passed to Charles Theodore, count and elector of the Palatinate. The new ruler preferred his existing home in Mannheim on the Rhine to living in Bavaria and tried unsuccessfully to trade his unloved inheritance for the Austrian Netherlands. Understandably, the people of Munich returned his disdain.G. Greindl in Freyberg (2000), 14-6. To offset this unhappy atmosphere, Charles Theodore devoted much attention to improvements in the city. Among others, he created an art gallery in the northern arcades of the Residence's Hofgarten (\\"Court Garden\\") and made both the garden and the new gallery open to the public (the former in 1780, the latter in 1781).E. D. Schmid in Freyberg (2000), 46. The Rumford Monument in the park honours Sir Benjamin Thompson's contribution While the Hofgarten was then the only public park in Munich, that was not the primary motivation for the creation of the English Garden. Rather, it was part of a series of military reforms being pursued under the guidance of Sir Benjamin Thompson, the new Elector's chief military aide, later created Count Rumford and appointed as Bavarian war minister. Born in Massachusetts, Thompson had served on the Loyalist side in the American Revolutionary War, and after the British defeat had returned to England before moving to continental Europe and entering Charles Theodore's service in 1784.Dombart (1972), 25-6; S. Miedaner in Freyberg (2000), 19. In 1788 Thompson proposed that in peacetime the majority of the soldiers of the Elector's army should be given leave to do civilian work, such as farming and gardening.S. Miedaner in Freyberg (2000), 19-20. In February 1789, Charles Theodore decreed that military gardens should be laid out in each garrison city, to provide soldiers with good agricultural knowledge and also to serve as recreation areas, accessible also to the public.Dombart (1972), 27-8. The planned location of the Munich gardens was the area north of the Schwabinger city gate, a hunting ground of the Wittelsbach rulers since the Middle Ages. Known as the Hirschanger (or \\"deer park\\"), the higher part of the hunting ground closer to the city was included in the scheme, while the Hirschau (also meaning \\"deer park\\"), lower and further north, and a more densely wooded part to the south known as the Hirschangerwald (\\"Deer Park Wood\\") were originally not included.Dombart (1972), 15. The whole area had been subject to flooding from the Isar, the river on which Munich stands, a little to the east. This problem was soon removed by the construction of a river wall in 1790, which became known as the \\"Riedl-Damm\\" after the engineer Anton von Riedl, who had supervised its construction.Dombart (1972), 41-2. The laying out of the military garden was begun in July 1789, and an area of 800 by slightly less than 200 metres was quickly made ready for cultivation,Dombart (1972), 30-2. but soon the idea was extended to the creation of a public park, of which the military garden should be only a small part. On August 13, 1789, Charles Theodore published a decree, devoting the Hirschanger to the amusement of the people of Munich. To advise on the project, the Royal Gardener Friedrich Ludwig Sckell (ennobled in 1808) who had studied landscape gardening in England and had previously worked for Charles Theodore at Schwetzingen, had been summoned to Munich earlier in August.Dombart (1972), 33-4. Various associated projects were made part of the park development, among them the Elevengarten (\\"Pupils' Garden\\", a garden for the students at the recently formed military academy), a \\"Schweizerey\\" (cattle farm), \\"Sch√§fery\\" (sheep farm) and \\"Ackerbauschule\\" (arable farming school) to improve farming techniques, and a \\"Vihearzneyschule\\" (veterinary school) for the treatment of cattle diseases.Dombart (1972), 40-1. Most of these projects did not long survive the creation of the park, but the veterinary school went on to become what is now the Tier√§rztliche Fakult√§t (Veterinary Faculty) of the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. The gateway from 1790 can be seen at the Veterin√§rstra√üe entrance to the garden.C. Karnehm in Freyberg (2000), 130; Geschichte der Tier√§rztlichen Fakult√§t M√ºnchen, faculty history page. (German) The park was initially named \\"Theodors Park\\", but it very quickly became known by the descriptive name of \\"the English Garden\\".A guidebook of 1793 is titled Skizze des neu angelegten englischen Gartens oder Theodors Park zu M√ºnchen (\\"Sketch of the newly created English Garden or Theodor's Park in Munich\\"): see Dombart (1972), 92-4. By May, 1790 sufficient progress had been made to allow Charles Theodore to make an inspection tour; but it was first in the spring of 1792 that the park was officially opened to the approximately 40,000 citizens of Munich.E. Schmid in Freyberg (2000), 51; Freyberg, ibid., 80-8 =Further development= The waterfall created in 1815 Thompson left Munich in 1798. His successor, Baron von Werneck, attempted to make the garden itself through its agricultural use. To that end he expanded the park in December 1799 to encompass the Hirschau, which was improved to provide pasture. The fields of the military gardens were added to the Englischer Garten in January 1800. Werneck's improvements had been costly, and in 1804 he was replaced by Sckell, who was given the post of Bayerischer Hofg√§rtenintendant (\\"Bavarian Court Garden Supervisor\\").S. Heym in Freyberg (2000), 26-8; D. Lehner in Freyberg (2000), 40. Although Sckell had had a guiding role from the beginning, many aspects of the execution differed from his ideas, which he set out in a memorandum of 1807.Reprinted in Freyberg (2000), 90-109. His long supervision of the garden (1804‚Äì1823) was marked by a movement away from agricultural uses and by concentration on the landscape garden. For instance, two mills at the point where the Schwabingerbach (Schwabing stream) leaves the Eisbach (Ice stream) were removed and an artificial waterfall was created in 1814-1815.E.D. Schmid in Freyberg (2000), 56; C. Karnehm in Freyberg (2000), 131. Under Sckell, the park took on its present form. The only significant addition since his time is the creation of the hill for the Monopteros by his nephew Carl August Sckell, who succeeded him as director of the park.Biller and Rasp (2006), 119; S. Rhotert in Freyberg (2000), 60. In the 20th century, there were some minor additions to the park, most notably the addition in 1952 of some thirty hectares of land where the locomotive factory of Joseph Anton von Maffei had stood, and in 1958-62 of a further 67 hectares from the Hirschauer Forst (Hirschau Wood).S. Rhotert in Freyberg (2000), 66; W. Palten in Freyberg (2000), 287. The century almost brought less welcome changes to the park. In the Second World War, Allied bombing damaged the Monopteros and destroyed the Chinese Tower, and 93,000 cubic metres of rubble were dumped in the Hirschanger. The area was only cleared in 1953, when a sports ground for schools was created there.W. Palten in Freyberg (2000), 287. (The park briefly had another sports ground, with the archery range that hosted the archery competitions for the 1972 Summer Olympics on the Werneckwiese by the Kleinhesseloher See.)1972 Summer Olympics official report. Volume 2. Part 2. pp. 142-5; W. Palten in Freyberg (2000), 289. Transport too has harmed the character of the garden, most notably with the construction in 1963 of the Isarring, part of Munich's central ring road, which divides the park just north of the Kleinhesseloher See.S. Rhotert in Freyberg (2000), 65. Towards the end of the 20th century the city of Munich wished to construct a tram route through the garden north of the Chinese Tower, currently a road used only by buses;E. M√ºller-Jentsch, \\"Stadt will Trambahn durch den Englischen Garten \\", SZ 14.04.1994. but it was opposed by the Bavarian government, which owns the land, and the Bayerische Verwaltungsgerichtshof rejected the plan.F. M√ºller, \\"Keine Trambahn im Englischen Garten \\", SZ 21.05.2001; A. D√ºrr, Tram durch den Englischen Garten gestoppt \\", SZ 30.03.2006. There were also natural disasters: many trees were destroyed by severe storms in 1964, 1988, and 1990 (the \\"Wiebke\\" storm); and Dutch elm disease has almost destroyed the elm trees of the park. Both kinds of loss were compensated by a \\"tree donation\\" campaign organised by Munich's Abendzeitung (\\"Evening Paper\\") in 1989 to 1990 on the occasion of the park's 200th anniversary; among the 1500 new trees that were planted were a thousand elms, using only varieties resistant to Dutch elm disease.W. Palten in Freyberg (2000), 231-2; 291. Sights and attractions =Japanese teahouse= The Japanese teahouse in winter In April 1972, to celebrate the Summer Olympics of that year, held in Munich, a Japanese teahouse and a Japanese garden were created on a small island at the south end of the Englischer Garten, behind the Haus der Kunst. The island lies in a lake which had been created only a few years earlier, in 1969. The teahouse was a gift to Bavaria from Soshitsu Sen, head of the Urasenke tea school in Kyoto, and it was designed by Soshitsu Sen and Mitsuo Nomura. A traditional Japanese tea ceremony takes place here regularly.Schmid (1989), 33; G. Staufenbiel in Freyberg (2000), 134; Teehaus KanShoAn , webpage of Urasenke M√ºnchen - Gesellschaft der Freunde des Teewegs e.V.; W. Palten in Freyberg (2000), 289. =Sch√∂nfeldwiese and surroundings= Ludwigskirche Between the Monopteros and the Japanisches Teehaus lies the Sch√∂nfeldwiese (\\"Beautiful field meadow\\"). In this part of the Gardens nude sunbathing has been permitted since the 1960s, something which many Germans practice. It caused quite a sensation at the time and also made the English Gardens well-known, even outside Munich. The Sch√∂nfeldwiese proper lies to the south of the Schwabingerbach, which crosses the English Garden at this point before flowing northwards along its west side; but the name is sometimes used of the whole larger open space. The expanse to the north of the Schwabingerbach, the Carl Theodorswiese (\\"Carl Theodors meadow\\") has the oldest construction in the park: the \\"Burgfrieds√§ule\\", a boundary marker from 1724, topped with the M√ºnchner Kindl stands in a grove of trees below the Monopteros.C. Karnehm in v. Freyberg (2000), 112-3. =Surfing= A surfer riding a wave in a stream in the Garden In one of the artificial streams flowing through the Englischer Garten, there is a standing wave produced by change from laminar to turbulent flow. Surfers line up along the bank taking turns entering the water with their boards. After a minute or so, successful surfers will voluntarily drop out returning to the end of the line allowing the next person in line an opportunity. The signage states that surfing should only be done by expert or skilled surfers. A short video of the swimming and surfing can be found here. =Monopteros= The Monopteros When the nearby wooden Apollo temple had fallen into disrepair, an early idea of Sckell's for a hilltop temple was taken upBiller and Rasp (2006), 120. and a new stone building of similar design was commissioned (an early plan even calls the Monopteros \\"Apollo Tempel\\", a name it never actually bore). This small (16 m high), round, Greek style temple was designed by Leo von Klenze. It was built on a 15 m high foundation, around which a small hill was created in 1832, using leftover building material from recent work on the Munich Residenz (Royal Residence). Hill and temple were completed in 1836. Ten Ionic columns support a shallow copper covered dome; palmettes adorn the sima. A particular feature of the Monopteros is the use of polychrome stone painting, an interest of Klenze at the time, who intended the building to serve as a model for its use.Dombart (1972), 167-70; Schmid (1989), 62-3; C. Karnehm in v. Freyberg (2000), 119-20; Biller and Rasp (2006), 120. =Steinerne Bank= Klenze's Steinerne Bank Before the Monopteros was built, a small circular temple had stood by the Eisbach a little to the south of the Chinesischer Turm. Designed by Johann Baptist Lechner (1758‚Äì1809) and erected in 1789, it became known as the Apollo temple after an Apollo statue by Josef Nepomuk Muxel was added to it in 1791. While the basis of the temple was tuff, the temple itself was wooden; and by the early nineteenth century, this had fallen into disrepair. In 1838, Leo von Klenze built an exedra or stone bench (Steinerne Bank) in place of the temple, with the inscription \\"Hier wo Ihr wallet, da war sonst Wald nur und Sumpf\\" (\\"Here where you meander was once only wood and marsh\\"). The temple's circular basis served as the basis for the curved bench.Schmid (1989), 42; C. Karnehm in von Freyberg (2000), 129. =Chinese Tower= Tower The Chinese Tower in winter The Chinesischer Turm (\\"Chinese Tower\\") is a 25-metre-high wooden structure, first constructed in 1789 to 1790, from a design by the Mannheimer military architect Joseph Frey (1758‚Äì1819).The designer was unknown in the early nineteenth century and occasionally Lechner is named. An 1887 attribution to Frey seems to be based on knowledge of the original plans (now lost). As Frey was still in Mannheim, Lechner may have been involved in the actual construction. See Dombart (1972), 247-8. The dates for Frey are those in Dombart and in Schmid (1989), 43; C. Karnehm in v. Freyberg (2000), 114 gives 1757-1812. It was modelled on the \\"Great Pagoda\\" in the Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew. The Pagoda, twice as high as the tower, was supposed to resemble a porcelain pagoda in the gardens of a Chinese emperor. The Munich tower has five storeys: the ground storey roof has a diameter of 19 m, the topmost storey of 6 m.Schmid (1989), 43-4. On July 13, 1944, the original tower burned down after heavy bombing; but a society aiming to rebuild it was formed in 1951 and the new tower, copied accurately from the original by consulting photographs and old drawings, was completed in September, 1952.Dombart (1972), 207-8; W. Palten in von Freyberg (2000), 287. Surroundings A wooden Chinesische Wirtschaft (restaurant in Chinese style), designed by Lechner, was added in 1790. In 1912, this was replaced by the present-day stone building, which reflected the original design.Biller and Rasp (2006), 120. With 7,000 seats, the beer garden at the Chinesischer Turm is the second largest in Munich. \\"Kocherlball\\" (cooks' ball) at the Chinese Tower, 2001 In the late nineteenth century up to 5000 servants, manual workers, soldiers, and students would come to the tower early on a Sunday morning to dance to the music of a brass band. The dance began around five in the morning and ended around eight o'clock, so that servants could return to serve their employers' breakfast or go to church. As a dance for servants it was known as the \\"Kocherlball\\" (cooks' ball). In 1904 the custom was forbidden by the police on moral grounds. But in 1989, to celebrate the two hundredth anniversary of the park, a revival was made, with around 4000 attending; and the dance has since been celebrated each year in July.W. Palten and K.-F. Beuckelmann in Freyberg (2000), 274; \\"Kocherlball: Tanz im Morgengrauen\\" article in Bayerischer Rundfunk, accessed August 10, 2008. A children's carousel was put up near the tower in 1823, similar in design to the current one. By 1912 a replacement was needed, which is still in use. It was designed by the Schwabinger sculptor Joseph Erlacher and the decoration painter August Julier. Alongside the usual horses, the carousel has less expected creatures to ride, such as ibex, stork and flamingo.C. Karnehm in Freyberg (2000), 118. Its wooden roof and pillars were restored from 1979 to 1980.W. Palten in Freyberg (2000), 290. South of the tower are the √ñkonomiegeb√§ude (\\"Economy buildings\\"), which were designed by Lechner towards the end of the 18th century as a model farm. Today, the √ñkonomiegeb√§ude are occupied by the management of the Englischer Garten.C. Karnehm in Freyberg (2000), 120. =Rumford-Saal= Rumford-Saal A little to the north of the Chinesischer Turm, the Rumford-Saal (Rumford Hall) or Rumfordhaus (Rumford House) is a small building in Palladian style. During its construction it was known as the \\"gro√üer Saal\\" (great hall) or \\"Militairsaal\\" (military hall); but it was later renamed to honour the garden's founder, Benjamin Thompson, Count Rumford.Dombart (1972), 109. It was built in 1791 by Lechner as an officers' mess (Offiziers-kasino) and was used first by the army, later by the court. The building, 30 m long and 10 m wide, has one and a half storeys; front and back have a portico with six wooden Ionic pillars. Its dining hall, adorned with many mirrors which give it its name, the \\"Spiegelsaal\\" (mirror room), has room for 150 people. The building is currently used by the city of Munich as a children's centre (\\"Kinderfreizeitst√§tte\\").Bauer (1964), 28; Dombart (1972), 110; C. Karnehm in v. Freyberg (2000), 123. =Kleinhesseloher See= The Kleinhesseloher See (\\"Kleinhesseloher Lake\\") was created under Werneck's direction around 1800 between the districts of Schwabing, at that time a village north of Munich, and Kleinhesselohe. Kleinhesselohe had been the original northern limit of the park, with a watchhouse and a gate to the northern Hirschau. The park warden there had set up an improvised beer shop for workers in the park. This soon expanded to offer milk and cold meals and came to be a favoured stop for walkers in the park, especially after a wooden dance place had been added.Dombart (1972), 103-6. Werneck's successor Sckell increased the size of the lake by one and a half times in 1807 to 1812, giving it its present form. It is constantly fed by water from the Eisbach. Three islands can be found within the lake's 86,410 square meters: K√∂nigsinsel (\\"King's Island\\", 2,720 m2), Kurf√ºrsteninsel (\\"Elector's Island\\", 1,260 m2) and Regenteninsel (\\"Regent's Island\\", 640 m2).Schmid (1989), 52, where the name of the large island is given as K√∂niginsel; but Schmid's map labels the island K√∂nigsinsel. Sckell monument on the banks of the Kleinhesseloher See Sckell's enlargement of the lake brought it close to Kleinhesselohe; and the little beer garden there was to be a forerunner of the modern Seehaus (\\"lake house\\"), with 2,500 seats. In 1882 to 1883 Gabriel von Seidel built a boathouse with food service. This was replaced with a new building by Rudolf Esterer in 1935; with a terrace overlooking the lake, this was very popular until 1970, when it was demolished. A competition for a new design was won by Alexander von Branca, with a design modelled on a Japanese village; but the work was found too costly and never executed. For fifteen years service was from temporary buildings, until in 1985 the current Seehaus was built to a design by Ernst H√ºrlimann and Ludwig Wiedemann.C. Karnehm in v. Freyberg (2000), 126; W. Palten in v. Freyberg (2000), 289. Today, the lake and the Seehaus are well-loved leisure destinations; pedal boats are also leased here to those who want to splash around. Two monuments near the lake honour its creators. The Werneck-Denkmal, a monument to Werneck, stands on a rise near the east side. It was erected in 1838 on Ludwig I's suggestion to a design by von Klenze.C. Karnehm in v. Freyberg (2000), 133. A little south of it, on the bank of the lake, the Sckell-S√§ule (\\"Sckell pillar\\") honours Ludwig von Sckell. This, also designed by von Klenze, was erected in 1824, a year after Sckell's death; the design was executed by Ernst von Bandel, who would later be known as the creator of the Hermannsdenkmal.C. Karnehm in v. Freyberg (2000), 124-5. =Hirschau= A flock of sheep in the Hirschau The English Garden is divided into two portions by the busy Isarring road. The southern part is around 2 km long, while the northern part, called the Hirschau, is around 3 km long. In contrast to the southern part, which on sunny days contains as many people as one would find in a medium-sized town, the Hirschau has a peaceful character. In the southern part the grass in the open expanses (heavily used for sport and sunbathing) must be kept short; but in the Hirschau some meadows are allowed to grow and mown for hay in June and August, while others are used as pasture for sheep.D. Holder in v. Freyberg (2000), 211-3. Two beer gardens, the \\"Aumeister\\", built in 1810-11 by the court mason (Hofmaurermeister) Joseph Deiglmayr (1760‚Äì1814)C. Karnehm in von Freyberg (2000), 110. and the \\"Hirschau\\", built in 1840,C. Karnehm in von Freyberg (2000), 116. The Hirschau was first opened under the name \\"Zum Hasenstall\\" by Joseph Anton von Maffei to provide meals for the workers in his factory, the \\"Maffei'sche Maschinenbauanstalt\\". are located at the north and south end of the Hirschau respectively. Open air theatre The northern part of the garden also contains a small amphitheatre, built in 1985 and called the new amphitheatre. (An amphitheatre built in 1793 to a similar plan, but in a different position, a little north of the Rumford-Saal, has not survived; this had been used primarily for fireworks exhibitions). The new amphitheatre is used for open air performances in summer.Dombart (1972), 119-21 (on the original amphitheatre); C. Karnehm in v. Freyberg (2000), 110 (on the new amphitheatre). To the east the Hirschau's border is formed by the Isar, which can be crossed at the Oberf√∂hring dam (Stauwehr Oberf√∂hring), built between 1920 and 1924, and at the Emmeram Bridge, a wooden pedestrian bridge first built in 1978. The bridge was destroyed by arson in 2002, and replaced by a new design in 2004.C. Karnehm in von Freyberg (2000), 117-8; 128; Biller and Rasp (2006), 170.

Constantine III (also Constantine V; ; , Western Armenian transliteration: Gosdantin or Kostantine; April 17, 1313 - December 21, 1362) was the King of Armenian Cilicia from 1344 to 1362.

Originally an independent town, it was included in the Milton Keynes \\"designated area\\" in 1967. From 1895 it formed an urban district with Bletchley, until 1974 when it became part of the borough of Milton Keynes. It is located at the south east edge of the city and is its gateway to northbound travellers on the A5.  Today  Aylesbury Street Bull & Butcher A mixture of old buildings and new developments, Fenny Stratford is a small town at the edge of Milton Keynes. Its market may be long gone but it hosts various shops, restaurants, pubs, newsagents, and hotels centered mainly around Aylesbury Street. There is an LGBT friendly night club on Watling Street. Fenny Stratford railway station, one of the six railway stations that serve the Milton Keynes urban area, is served by the (Bletchley - Bedford) Marston Vale Line. History The town name is an Old English language word that means 'marshy ford on a Roman road'. The Roman road in this case is the Watling Street. There are traces of the Romano-British settlement MAGIOVINIUM (or Magiovintum) at Dropshot Farm, on the edge of the present day occupation.Roman Britain: Magiovinium (Possibly the oldest known gold coin in Britain was found here in 1849, a gold stater of the mid-second century BCE. Although known as the \\"Bletchley\\" hoards, two coin hoards were also found at or near the site of MAGIOVINIUM, consisting of silver denarii, in 1967 and 1987.British Museum research collection: BletchleyBritish Museum) The town was recorded in manorial rolls in 1252 as Fenni Stratford.'Parishes : Bletchley with Fenny Stratford and Water Eaton' ‚Äì Victoria History of the Counties of England, A History of the County of Buckingham: Volume 4 (1927), pp. 274‚Äì283. King James I awarded a market charter in 1608, making it formally a town. Being an ancient market town, Fenny Stratford was the location of a weekly market for many years until 1665 when the town was badly hit by the bubonic plague. As a result, the main London-Chester route that ran through the town on Watling Street was diverted away from it, and the market ceased to exist. The market was never reinstated: the town was very much in ruins by the early eighteenth century, and had by this time been joined with both Bletchley and Simpson, being commonly considered a hamlet of the former. Parish church St Martin's Church On St Martin's Day 1724, the first stone was laid of the new parish church of Fenny Stratford, marking a fresh start in the town's history. Browne Willis, a historian of the day, had raised the funds for its construction. The Church was built on the site of the old chantry chapel of St. Margaret and St. Catherine at Fenny Stratford. He erected the church as a memorial to his grandfather Dr. Thomas Willis, a famous physician, who lived in St. Martin's Lane in the parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields in London, and who died on St. Martin's day, 11 November 1675. To perpetuate his own memory, Browne Willis arranged for a sermon to be preached at St. Martin's Church on each St. Martin's Day, for which a fee was payable. During his lifetime, he also celebrated the occasion with a dinner attended by local clergy and gentry, an event which has continued to the present day. = The Fenny Poppers = The Fenny Poppers are six small ceremonial cannon which date from this time and are still fired ceremonially (with blank charges) today. There is no record of their first use. In 1740, Browne Willis bought a house in Aylesbury Street, Fenny Stratford and the rent from this was used to pay for the sermon and gunpowder. Following his death in 1760, the traditions were carried on and later documented. All six Poppers were re-cast by the Eagle Foundry, Northampton in 1859, after one of them burst. They are still in use today, and were recently examined and x-rayed to ensure there are no cracks. During their long history, many sites have been used for this battery. These include the Canal Wharf, land behind the Church, St, Martin's Hall, the Churchyard and now the Leon Recreation Ground, which was once part of the lands belonging to the Chantry. The Poppers each weigh about 19 pounds (8.5 kg). The bore, 6\\" by 1¬æ\\" (152 mm x 44 mm) will take one ounce (28g) of gunpowder, which is plugged with well-rammed newspaper. They are fired three times on St. Martin's Day (11 November): noon, 2pm and 4pm. There is of course no connection with Remembrance Day (also 11 November). In 1901 they were fired to mark the death of Queen Victoria; the 81 salvoes were heard as far away as Olney. On 1 January 2000, at 11am the Poppers were fired to mark the beginning of the second millennium. At 2pm on 4 August 2000, a salute of six Poppers was fired to celebrate the 100th birthday of the Queen Mother. At 2pm on 5 June 2012 a salute was fired to mark the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II.  Invention of the Diesel Engine in Fenny Stratford  The world's first successful heavy oil engines were invented and built by Herbert Akroyd Stuart in Fenny Stratford. There is a plaque commemorating this at the westerly end of Denmark Street in Fenny Stratford opposite The Foundry public house ‚Äì though the location of Akroyd Stuart's workshop is usually given as \\"Bletchley\\", which is a larger town adjoining Fenny Stratford. These engines were precursors to what is now known as the Diesel engine: Rudolf Diesel based his designs (1892) on Akroyd Stuart's proven inventions (1890) of direct (airless) fuel injection and compression ignition. An experimental model was tried out at the offices of the Fenny Stratford Times Newspaper, and the first production models were installed at the nearby Great Brickhill Waterworks where they were in operation from 1892 to 1923. (It has been argued that engines of this type might have become known as \\"Akroyds\\", had Diesel not been a rather paranoid person not prone to giving other inventors credit.) Waterways Fenny lock alongside the Red Lion pub The Grand Union Canal runs through the southern outskirts of the town and Fenny Lock is located in Simpson Road area to the east of Watling Street. It is notable both for the manually operated swing bridge which crosses the lock and for the very small rise in the lock (around , the shallowest on the Grand Union Canal network). This was deemed necessary by the canal engineers because the next section northwards of the canal could not be made adequately watertight at reasonable cost without it.Canal Settlement in Fenny Stratford, Edward Legg, Buckinghamshire Archeological Society, p. 69 [PDF] The level persists from this lock for eleven miles, through what is now Milton Keynes, through to the next lock at Cosgrove. A little further south of the canal bridge, Watling Street crosses the river Ouzel (a tributary of the river Great Ouse: it was the marshy ford across this river that gave the town its name. Fenny Stratford is bordered by North Street, Bletchley Leisure Centre, Knowles School/Leon Recreational Ground and the Fenny Allotments from the west, the Rail line, Watling street and Denbigh East from the north, Water Eaton Brook by the south and the River Ouzel and Grand Union Canal from the east. Manor Fields Manor Fields sports ground to the south of the town (and just across the Grand Union Canal from Bletchley's 'Trees' estate) is home to Bletchley Town, Bletchley RUFC, the Irish Centre and other activities. The Roman town lay either side of Watling Street and thus Manor Fields lies on part of it.

Belloc was also an orator, poet, sailor, satirist, writer of letters, soldier, and political activist. His Catholic faith had a strong impact on his works. He was President of the Oxford Union and later MP for Salford South from 1906 to 1910. He was a noted disputant, with a number of long-running feuds. Belloc became a naturalised British subject in 1902 while retaining his French citizenship. His writings encompassed religious poetry and comic verse for children. His widely sold Cautionary Tales for Children included \\"Jim, who ran away from his nurse, and was eaten by a lion\\" and \\"Matilda, who told lies and was burned to death\\".\\"Matilda,\\" 1907, in the Poetry Archive. He also collaborated with G. K. Chesterton on a number of works.Shaw, George Bernard. \\"Belloc and Chesterton,\\" The New Age, Vol. II, No. 16, 15 February 1918.Lynd, Robert. \\"Mr. G. K. Chesterton and Mr. Hilaire Belloc.\\" In Old and New Masters, T. Fisher Unwin Ltd., 1919.McInerny, Ralph. \\"The Chesterbelloc Thing,\\" The Catholic Thing, 30 September 2008.  Family and career  Hilaire Belloc portrait, 1903 Belloc was born in La Celle-Saint-Cloud, France to a French father, Louis Belloc (1830-1872) and an English mother. His sister Marie Adelaide Belloc Lowndes also grew up to be a writer. His mother Bessie Rayner Parkes (1829‚Äì1925) was a writer, activist, and a major force in efforts to gain greater equality for women, being a co-founder of the English Woman's Journal and the Langham Place Group. Belloc himself campaigned against women's suffrage; he was a member of the Women's National Anti-Suffrage League. Belloc's maternal grandfather was Joseph Parkes (1796‚Äì1865), a prosperous solicitor and a liberal with Radical sympathies. Belloc's grandmother, Elizabeth Rayner Priestley (1797‚Äì1877), was born in the United States, a granddaughter of the polymath Joseph Priestley. In 1867, Bessie married attorney Louis Belloc, son of the French painter Jean- Hilaire Belloc. In 1872, five years after they wed, Louis died, but not before being wiped out financially in a stock market crash. The young widow then brought her children back to England. Hilaire Belloc grew up in England, and would spend most of his life there. His boyhood was spent in Slindon, West Sussex, for which he often felt homesick in later life, as evidenced in poems such as \\"West Sussex Drinking Song\\", \\"The South Country\\", and even the more melancholy, \\"Ha'nacker Mill\\". After being educated at John Henry Newman'sBrickel, Alfred G. \\"Hilaire Belloc and Cardinal Newman,\\" The American Catholic Quarterly Review, Vol. XLVII, N¬∞.185, 1922. Oratory School in Edgbaston, Birmingham, Belloc served his term of military service, as a French citizen, with an artillery regiment near Toul in 1891. Belloc proceeded to Balliol College, Oxford, as a history scholar. He secured a first-class honours degree and never lost his love for Balliol, as is illustrated by his verse \\"Balliol made me, Balliol fed me/ Whatever I had she gave me again\\". He was powerfully built, with great stamina and walked extensively in Britain and Europe. While courting his future wife Elodie Hogan (1868‚Äì1914), an American whom he first met in 1890, the impecunious Belloc walked a good part of the way from the midwest of the United States to her home in northern California, \\"paying\\" for lodging at remote farm houses and ranches by sketching the owners and reciting poetry. The couple married in 1896. In 1906, he purchased land and a house called King's Land at Shipley, West Sussex, where he raised his offspring and lived until shortly before his death. Elodie and Belloc had five offspring before her death in 1914 from influenza. After her death, Belloc wore mourning garb for the rest of his life and kept her room exactly as she had left it.The Point (August 1958). His son Louis was killed in 1918 while serving in the Royal Flying Corps in northern France. Belloc placed a memorial tablet at the nearby Cambrai Cathedral. It is in the same side chapel as the noted icon Our Lady of Cambrai. During the Second World War his son Peter Gilbert Marie Sebastian Belloc died at age 36 of pneumonia on 2 April 1941. He fell ill while on active service with the 5th Battalion of the Royal Marines in Scotland. He is buried in West Grinstead at Our Lady of Consolation and St. Francis churchyard. In 1937, Belloc was invited to be a visiting professor at Fordham University by university president Robert Gannon. Belloc delivered a series of lectures at Fordham which he completed in May of that year. While pleased to accept the invitation, the experience left him physically exhausted and he considered stopping the lectures early. Belloc suffered a stroke in 1941 and never recovered from its effects. He died on 16 July 1953 at Mount Alvernia Nursing Home in Guildford, Surrey, from burns and shock following a fall he had while placing a log into a fireplace at King's Land.Article by Bernard Berganzi. His body was buried at the Shrine of Our Lady of Consolation at West Grinstead in the county of West Sussex, where he had regularly attended Mass as a parishioner.Belloc's entry in Findagrave website (2019). https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/6884181/hilaire-belloc His estate was probated at ¬£7,451. At his funeral Mass, homilist Monsignor Ronald Knox observed, \\"No man of his time fought so hard for the good things.\\" Boys from the Choir and Sacristy of Worth Preparatory School sang and served at the Mass. Recent biographies of Belloc have been written by A. N. Wilson and Joseph Pearce, and Jesuit political philosopher James Schall's Remembering Belloc was published by St. Augustine Press in September 2013. =Political career= An 1895 graduate of Balliol College, Oxford, Belloc was a noted figure within the University, being President of the Oxford Union, the undergraduate debating society. He went into politics after he became a naturalised British subject. A great disappointment in his life was his failure to gain a fellowship of All Souls College, Oxford in 1895. This failure may have been caused in part by his producing a small statue of the Virgin and placing it before him on the table during the interview for the fellowship. From 1906 to 1910 he was a Liberal Party Member of Parliament for Salford South. During one campaign speech he was asked by a heckler if he was a \\"papist.\\" Retrieving his rosary from his pocket he responded, \\"Sir, so far as possible I hear Mass each day and I go to my knees and tell these beads each night. If that offends you, then I pray God may spare me the indignity of representing you in Parliament.\\" The crowd cheered and Belloc won the election. His only period of steady employment after that was from 1914 to 1920 as editor of Land and Water, a journal devoted to the progress of the war. Otherwise he lived by his writing and was often impecunious. =In controversy and debate= Belloc first came to public attention shortly after arriving at Balliol College, Oxford as a recent French army veteran. Attending his first debate of the Oxford Union Debating Society, he saw that the affirmative position was wretchedly and half-heartedly defended. As the debate drew to its conclusion and the division of the house was called, he rose from his seat in the audience, and delivered a vigorous, impromptu defence of the proposition. Belloc won that debate from the audience, as the division of the house then showed, and his reputation as a debater was established. He was later elected president of the Union. He held his own in debates there with F. E. Smith and John Buchan, the latter a friend.Sir John Simon, who was a contemporary at Oxford, described his \\"...resonant, deep pitched voice...\\" as making an \\"...unforgettable impression\\".Francis West, Gilbert Murray, p. 107, describes Murray's impression on an occasion in 1899: In July [...] [Murray] attended a meeting on the principles of Liberalism, at which Hilaire Belloc spoke brilliantly although Murray could not afterwards remember a word that he had said. He was at his most effective in the 1920s, on the attack against H. G. Wells's The Outline of History, in which he criticised Wells' secular bias and his belief in evolution by means of natural selection, a theory that Belloc asserted had been completely discredited. Wells remarked that \\"Debating Mr. Belloc is like arguing with a hailstorm\\". Belloc's review of Outline of History famously observed that Wells' book was a powerful and well-written volume, \\"up until the appearance of Man, that is, somewhere around page seven.\\" Wells responded with a small book, Mr. Belloc Objects.Wells, H. G., Mr. Belloc Objects, to the Outline of History, Watts & Company, London, 1926. Not to be outdone, Belloc followed with, \\"Mr. Belloc Still Objects.\\" G. G. Coulton, a keen and persistent opponent, wrote Mr. Belloc on Medieval History in a 1920 article. After a long simmering feud, Belloc replied with a booklet, The Case of Dr. Coulton, in 1938. His style during later life fulfilled the nickname he received in childhood, Old Thunder. Belloc's friend, Lord Sheffield, described his provocative personality in a preface to The Cruise of the Nona.Time and again I have seen him throw out a sufficiently outrageous theory in order to stimulate his company, and, be it said, for the pleasure of seeing how slowly he might be dislodged from a position he had purposely taken up knowing it to be untenable.... Of course Belloc was prejudiced, but there were few who knew him who did not love his prejudices, who did not love to hear him fight for them, and who did not honor him for the sincerity and passion with which he held to them. Once the battle was joined all his armoury was marshalled and flung into the fray. Dialectic, Scorn, Quip, Epigram, Sarcasm, Historical Evidence, Massive Argument, and Moral Teaching --of all these weapons he was a past master and each was mobilised and made to play its proper part in the attack. Yet he was a courteous and a chivalrous man. A deeply sensitive man, his was the kindest and most understanding nature I have ever known. In spite of a rollicking and bombastic side he was as incapable of the least cruelty as he was capable of the most delicate sympathy with other people's feelings. As he himself used to say of others in a curiously quiet and simple way, \\"He is a good man. He will go to Heaven.\\" =Hobbies= During his later years, he would sail when he could afford to do so and became a well-known yachtsman. He won many races and was on the French sailing team. In the early 1930s, he was given an old Jersey pilot cutter, called Jersey. He sailed this for some years around the coasts of England, with the help of younger men. One of them, Dermod MacCarthy, wrote a book about his time on the water with Belloc, called Sailing with Mr Belloc.Sailing with Mr Belloc by Dermod MacCarthy : Vintage/Ebury (A Division of Random House Group), 20 October 1986 (reprint) : / 0002727757  Writing  The prolific author of more than 150 books,Michael H. Markel, Hilaire Belloc, Twayne Publishers (1975), p. 34David Perkins, A History of Modern Poetry: From the 1890s to the High Modernist Mode, Harvard University Press (1976), p. 192 Belloc wrote on myriad subjects, from warfare to poetry to the many current topics of his day. He has been called one of the Big Four of Edwardian Letters, along with H.G.Wells, George Bernard Shaw, and G. K. Chesterton, all of whom debated with each other into the 1930s. Belloc was closely associated with Chesterton, and Shaw coined the term Chesterbelloc for their partnership. He was co-editor with Cecil Chesterton of the literary periodical the Eye Witness, published until 1912 by Charles Granville's Stephen Swift Ltd. The paper was later called the New Witness, and still later, G. K.'s Weekly. Asked once why he wrote so much,See Hilaire Belloc's books for a chronological list of work by Belloc he responded, \\"Because my children are howling for pearls and caviar.\\" Belloc observed that \\"The first job of letters is to get a canon,\\" that is, to identify those works a writer sees as exemplary of the best of prose and verse. For his own prose style, he claimed to aspire to be as clear and concise as \\"Mary had a little lamb.\\" =Essays and travel writing= His best travel writing has secured a permanent following. The Path to Rome (1902), an account of a walking pilgrimage he made from central France across the Alps and down to Rome, has remained continuously in print. More than a mere travelogue, The Path to Rome contains descriptions of the people and places he encountered, his drawings in pencil and in ink of the route, humour, poesy, and the reflections of a large mind turned to the events of his time as he marches along his solitary way. His book The Pyrenees, published in 1909, shows a depth of detailed knowledge of that region such as would only be gained from personal experience. At every turn, Belloc shows himself to be profoundly in love with Europe and with the Faith that he claims has produced it. As an essayist he was one of a small, admired and dominant group (with Chesterton, E. V. Lucas and Robert Lynd) of popular writers. =Poetry= Original cover for Cautionary Tales for Children, illustrated by Basil T. Blackwood His Cautionary Tales for Children; humorous poems with an implausible moral, illustrated by Basil Temple Blackwood (signing as \\"B.T.B.\\") and later by Edward Gorey, are the most widely known of his writings.Vogel, James. \\"Hilaire Belloc, Cautionary Tales and Bad Child‚Äôs Book of Beasts,\\" Crisis Magazine, 29 March 2012. Supposedly for children, they, like Lewis Carroll's works, are more to adult and satirical tastes: \\"Henry King, Who chewed bits of string and was early cut off in dreadful agonies\\".The Chief Defect of Henry King :Was chewing little bits of String. :At last he swallowed some which tied :Itself in ugly Knots inside. :Physicians of the Utmost Fame :Were called at once; but when they came :They answered, as they took their Fees, :\\"There is no Cure for this Disease. :Henry will very soon be dead.\\" :His Parents stood about his Bed :Lamenting his Untimely Death, :When Henry, with his Latest Breath, :Cried ‚Äì \\"Oh, my Friends, be warned by me, :That Breakfast, Dinner, Lunch and Tea :Are all the Human Frame Requires...\\" :With that the Wretched Child expires. A similar poem tells the story of \\"Rebecca, who slammed doors for fun and perished miserably\\". The tale of \\"Matilda who told lies and was burned to death\\" was adapted into the play Matilda Liar! by Debbie Isitt. Quentin Blake, the illustrator, described Belloc as at one and the same time the overbearing adult and mischievous child. Roald Dahl was a follower. But Belloc has broader if sourer scope. For example, with Lord Lundy (who was \\"far too freely moved to Tears\\"): :It happened to Lord Lundy then :as happens to so many men :about the age of 26 :they shoved him into politics ... leading up to :\\"we had intended you to be :the next Prime Minister but three... instead, Lundy is condemned to the ultimate political wilderness: :...The stocks were sold; the Press was squared: :The Middle Class was quite prepared. :But as it is! . . . My language fails! :Go out and govern New South Wales!\\" :The Aged Patriot groaned and died: :And gracious! how Lord Lundy cried! Of more weight is Belloc's Sonnets and Verse, a volume that deploys the same singing and rhyming techniques of his children's verses. Belloc's poetry is often religious, often romantic; throughout The Path to Rome he writes in spontaneous song. =History, politics, economics= Hilaire Belloc portrait by Emil Otto Hopp√©, 1915 Three of his best-known non-fiction works are The Servile State (1912), Europe and Faith (1920) and The Jews (1922). From an early age Belloc knew Cardinal Henry Edward Manning, who was responsible for the conversion of his mother to Roman Catholicism. In The Cruise of the \\"Nona\\" (1925), he mentions a \\"profound thing\\" that Manning said to him when he was just twenty years old: \\"All human conflict is ultimately theological.\\" What Manning meant, Belloc explains, is \\"that all wars and revolutions, and all decisive struggles between parties of men arise from a difference in moral and transcendental doctrine.\\"The Cruise of the \\"Nona\\". Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1958, p. 48. Belloc adds that he never met any man, \\"arguing for what should be among men, but took for granted as he argued that the doctrine he consciously or unconsciously accepted was or should be a similar foundation for all mankind. Hence battle.\\"The Cruise of the \\"Nona\\". Harmondsworth: Penguin, p. 49. Manning's involvement in the 1889 London Dock Strike made a major impression on Belloc and his view of politics, according to biographer Robert Speaight. He became a trenchant critic both of capitalismRaymond Williams, Culture and Society, p. 186: Belloc's argument is that capitalism as a system is breaking down, and that this is to be welcomed. A society in which a minority owns and controls the means of production, while the majority are reduced to proletarian status, is not only wrong but unstable. Belloc sees it breaking down in two ways ‚Äì on the one hand into State action for welfare (which pure capitalism cannot embody); on the other hand into monopoly and the restraint of trade. There are only two alternatives to this system: socialism, which Belloc calls collectivism; and the redistribution of property on a significant scale, which Belloc calls distributivism. and of many aspects of socialism.Socialism and the Servile State: A Debate between Hilaire Belloc and J. Ramsay MacDonald, South West London Federation of the Independent Labour, 1911. With others (G. K. Chesterton, Cecil Chesterton, Arthur Penty) Belloc had envisioned the socioeconomic system of distributism. In The Servile State, written after his party-political career had come to an end, and other works, he criticised the modern economic order and parliamentary system, advocating distributism in opposition to both capitalism and socialism. Belloc made the historical argument that distributism was not a fresh perspective or program of economics but rather a proposed return to the economics that prevailed in Europe for the thousand years when it was Catholic. He called for the dissolution of Parliament and its replacement with committees of representatives for the various sectors of society, an idea that was also popular among Fascists, under the name of corporatism. He contributed an article on \\"Land-Tenure in the Christian Era\\" to the Catholic Encyclopedia.Belloc, Hilaire Joseph Peter\\", The Catholic Encyclopedia and Its Makers, New York, the Encyclopedia Press, 1917, p. 12 With these linked themes in the background, he wrote a long series of contentious biographies of historical figures, including Oliver Cromwell, James II, and Napoleon. They show him as an ardent proponent of orthodox Catholicism and a critic of many elements of the modern world. Outside academe, Belloc was impatient with what he considered axe-grinding histories, especially what he called \\"official history.\\"There is an enormous book called volume 1 of A Cambridge History of the Middle Ages. It is 759 pages in length of close print.... It does not mention the Mass once. That is as though you were to write a history of the Jewish dispersion without mentioning the synagogue or of the British empire without mentioning the city of London or the Navy (Letters from Hilaire Belloc, Hollis and Carter, 75). Joseph Pearce notes also Belloc's attack on the secularism of H. G. Wells's popular Outline of History: > Belloc objected to his adversary's tacitly anti-Christian stance, epitomized > by the fact that Wells had devoted more space in his \\"history\\" to the > Persian campaign against the Greeks than he had given to the figure of > Christ. He wrote also substantial amounts of military history. In alternative history, he contributed to the 1931 collection If It Had Happened Otherwise edited by Sir John Squire. =Reprints= Ignatius Press of California and IHS Press of Virginia have reissued Belloc. TAN Books of Charlotte, North Carolina, publishes a number of Belloc's works, particularly his historical writings. Religion Hilaire Belloc portrait, 1910 One of Belloc's most famous statements was \\"the faith is Europe and Europe is the faith\\"; this sums up his strongly held, orthodox Catholic views, and the cultural conclusions he drew from them. Those views were expressed at length in many of his works from the period 1920‚Äì40. These are still cited as exemplary of Catholic apologetics. They have also been criticised, for instance by comparison with the work of Christopher Dawson during the same period. As a young man, Belloc lost his faith. Then came a spiritual event, which he never discussed publicly, that returned him to Catholicism for the remainder of his life. Belloc alludes to this return to the faith in a passage in The Cruise of the Nona. According to his biographer A. N. Wilson (Hilaire Belloc, Hamish Hamilton), Belloc never wholly apostatised from the Faith (ibid p. 105). The momentous event is fully described by Belloc in The Path to Rome (pp. 158‚Äì61). It took place in the French village of Undervelier at the time of Vespers. Belloc said of it, \\"not without tears\\", \\"I considered the nature of Belief\\" and \\"it is a good thing not to have to return to the faith\\". (See Hilaire Belloc by Wilson at pp. 105‚Äì06.) Belloc's Catholicism was uncompromising. He believed that the Catholic Church provided hearth and home for the human spirit.A.N. Wilson's Introduction to Belloc's Complete Verse, Pimlico, 1991. More humorously, his tribute to Catholic culture can be understood from his well-known saying, \\"Wherever the Catholic sun does shine, there's always laughter and good red wine.\\" He had a disparaging view of the Church of England, and used sharp words to describe heretics, such as, \\"Heretics all, whoever you may be/ In Tarbes or Nimes or over the sea/ You never shall have good words from me/ Caritas non-conturbat me\\". Indeed, in his \\"Song of the Pelagian Heresy\\" he becomes quite strident, describing how the Bishop of Auxerre, \\"with his stout Episcopal staff/ So thoroughly thwacked and banged/ The heretics all, both short and tall/ They rather had been hanged\\". Belloc sent his son Louis to Downside School 1911‚Äì1915. Louis's biography and death in August 1918 is recorded in \\"Downside and the War\\". =On Islam= Belloc's 1937 book The Crusades: the World's Debate, he wrote, In The Great Heresies (1938), Belloc argued that although \\"Muslim culture happens to have fallen back in material applications; there is no reason whatever why it should not learn its new lesson and become our equal in all those temporal things which now alone give us our superiority over it‚Äîwhereas in Faith we have fallen inferior to it.\\" The Great Heresies, Ch. 4, \\"The Great and Enduring Heresy of Mohammed.\\" Belloc continued: \\"There is no reason why its recent inferiority in mechanical construction, whether military or civilian, should continue indefinitely. Even a slight accession of material power would make the further control of Islam by an alien culture difficult. A little more and there will cease that which our time has taken for granted, the physical domination of Islam by the disintegrated Christendom we know.\\" At the time of his writing, the Islamic world was still largely under the rule of the European colonial powers and the threat to Britain was from Fascism and Nazism. Belloc, however, considered that Islam was permanently intent on destroying the Christian faith, as well as the West, which Christendom had built. In The Great Heresies, Belloc grouped the Protestant Reformation together with Islam as one of the major heresies threatening the \\"Universal Church\\". =Accusations of antisemitism= :For fuller discussion, see section in G. K.'s Weekly Belloc's attitude towards Judaism is complex and has been a subject of controversy.Ian Boyd, \\"Hilaire Belloc: the myth and the man\\", The Tablet, 12 July 2003 Belloc took a leading role in denouncing the Marconi scandal of 1912, in which government ministers were caught insider trading. Belloc emphasized that key players in both the government and the Marconi corporation had been Jewish. Jewish historian Todd Edelman identifies Catholic writers as central critics. In his opinion: > The most virulent attacks in the Marconi affair were launched by Hilaire > Belloc and the brothers Cecil and G.K. Chesterton, whose hostility to Jews > was linked to their opposition to liberalism, their backward-looking > Catholicism, and the nostalgia for a medieval Catholic Europe that they > imagined was ordered, harmonious, and homogeneous. The Jew baiting at the > time of the Boer War and the Marconi scandal was linked to a broader > protest, mounted in the main by the Radical wing of the Liberal Party, > against the growing visibility of successful businessmen in national life > and their challenges to what were seen as traditional English values. A. N. Wilson's biography expresses the belief that Belloc tended to allude to Jews negatively in conversation, sometimes obsessively. Anthony Powell mentions in his review of that biography that in his view Belloc was thoroughly antisemitic, at all but a personal level. From his days in politics onwards, Belloc repeatedly demonstrated a belief that Jewish people had significant control over society and the world of finance. In The Cruise of the Nona, Belloc reflected equivocally on the Dreyfus Affair after thirty years.I, for my part, pretend to no certain conclusion in the matter‚Ä¶ Of my own intimate acquaintance who were on the spot [at Dreyfus' trial] and competent to judge, most were for the innocence of Dreyfus: but the rest, fully competent also, were and are, convinced of his guilt‚Ä¶ There are in England to-day two Englishmen whose wide knowledge of Europe and especially of Paris, and the French tongue and society, enable them to judge. They are both close friends of mine. One is for, the other against‚Ä¶ I believe that, when the passions have died down, the Dreyfus case will remain for history very much what the Diamond Necklace has remained, or the Tichborne case; that is, there will be a popular legend, intellectually worth nothing; and, for the historian, the task of criticising that legend, but hardly of solving the problem. Norman Rose's book The Cliveden Set (2000) asserts that Belloc 'was moved by a deep vein of hysterical anti-semitism'. In his 1922 book, The Jews, Belloc argued that \\"the continued presence of the Jewish nation intermixed with other nations alien to it presents a permanent problem of the gravest character,\\" and that the \\"Catholic Church is the conservator of an age-long European tradition, and that tradition will never compromise with the fiction that a Jew can be other than a Jew. Wherever the Catholic Church has power, and in proportion to its power, the Jewish problem will be recognized to the full.\\"Belloc, Hilaire, The Jews, London: Constable, 1922, 3‚Äì5, 209‚Äì210. Robert Speaight cited a letter by Belloc in which he pilloried Nesta Webster because of her accusations against \\"the Jews\\". In February 1924, Belloc wrote to an American Jewish friend regarding an antisemitic book by Webster. Webster had rejected Christianity, studied Eastern religions, accepted the Hindu concept of the equality of all religions and was fascinated by theories of reincarnation and ancestral memory.Nesta Webster, Spacious Days, London and Bombay, 1950, pp. 103 and 172‚Äì5. Speaight also points out that when faced with antisemitism in practice‚Äîas at elitist country clubs in the United States before World War II‚Äîhe voiced his disapproval. Belloc also condemned Nazi antisemitism in The Catholic and the War (1940). Sussex Belloc grew up in Slindon and spent most of his life in West Sussex. He always wrote of Sussex as if it were the crown of England and the western Sussex Downs the jewel in that crown. He loved Sussex to the point of idolatry as the place where he was brought up and as his spiritual home. Belloc wrote several works about Sussex including Ha'nacker Mill, The South Country, the travel guide Sussex (1906) and The County of Sussex (1936). One of his best-known works relating to Sussex is The Four Men: a Farrago (1911), in which the four characters, each aspects of Belloc's personality, travel on a pilgrimage across the county from Robertsbridge in the far east to Harting in the far west. The work has influenced others including Sussex folk musician Bob Copper, who retraced Belloc's steps in the 1980s. Belloc was also a lover of Sussex songs and wrote lyrics for some songs which have since been put to music. Belloc is remembered in an annual celebration in Sussex, known as Belloc Night, that takes place on the writer's birthday, 27 July, in the manner of Burns Night in Scotland. The celebration includes reading from Belloc's work and partaking of a bread and cheese supper with pickles. In the media * Stephen Fry has recorded an audio collection of Belloc's children's poetry. * A notable admirer of Belloc was the composer Peter Warlock, who set many of his poems to music. * Peter Ustinov recorded Belloc's The Cautionary Tales in 1968 for the Musical Heritage Society (MHC 9249M). * A well-known parody of Belloc by Sir John Squire, intended as a tribute, is Mr. Belloc's Fancy. * Syd Barrett, a founder of Pink Floyd, was a fan. His song \\"Matilda Mother\\" was drawn directly from verses in Cautionary Tales, and was rewritten when Belloc's estate refused permission to record them. The Belloc version has been released on a 40th anniversary reissue of The Piper at the Gates of Dawn. * King's Mill, Shipley, once owned by Belloc, was used in Jonathan Creek. * On the second episode of Monty Python's Flying Circus, in the sketch \\"The Mouse Problem\\", a list of famous people who secretly were mice is concluded with \\"and, of course, Hilaire Belloc\\".

It was decided to move the annual parade to downtown and festival to the Seattle Center to better accommodate the growing attendance. Future plans There is a long history of consecutive plans for physical revision of Seattle Center. Ever since Seattle City Council approved the Seattle Center Century 21 Master Plan in August 2008, it has effectively directed physical change on the 74-acre campus. This future-looking, 20-year plan sets forth 10 planning and design principles to effectively guide redevelopment. Completed first phase projects were realized through an innovative mix of public and private funding. They include: Seattle Center Skatepark, Broad Street Green, Seattle Center Armory (partially complete), Theater Commons, Chihuly Garden and Glass and Artists at Play (playground). Halfway through its 20-year duration, the Master Plan is primed to respond to some significant external changes, alongside exciting new opportunities on the grounds, to continue physical transformation at Seattle Center so that this unique urban campus can continue to accommodate the needs and desires of the broader community for many generations to come.

In spite of emigration and a well-developed connection to music imported from the rest of Europe and the United States, the music of Scotland has kept many of its traditional aspects; indeed, it has itself influenced many forms of music. Many outsiders associate Scottish folk music almost entirely with the Great Highland Bagpipe, which has long played an important part in Scottish music. Although this particular form of bagpipe developed exclusively in Scotland, it is not the only Scottish bagpipe. The earliest mention of bagpipes in Scotland dates to the 15th century although they are believed to have been introduced to Britain by the Roman armies. The p√¨ob mh√≥r, or Great Highland Bagpipe, was originally associated with both hereditary piping families and professional pipers to various clan chiefs; later, pipes were adopted for use in other venues, including military marching. Piping clans included the Clan Henderson, MacArthurs, MacDonalds, MacKays and, especially, the MacCrimmon, who were hereditary pipers to the Clan MacLeod. Early music The harper on the Monifeith Pictish Stone, 700 ‚Äì 900 AD Stringed instruments have been known in Scotland from at least the Iron Age. The first evidence of lyres were found in the Greco-Roman period on the Isle of Skye (dating from 2300 BCE), making it Europe's oldest surviving stringed instrument. Bards, who acted as musicians, but also as poets, story tellers, historians, genealogists and lawyers, relying on an oral tradition that stretched back generations, were found in Scotland as well as Wales and Ireland.M. J. Green, The Celtic World (London: Routledge, 1996), , p. 428. Often accompanying themselves on the harp, they can also be seen in records of the Scottish courts throughout the medieval period.W. McLeod, Divided Gaels: Gaelic Cultural Identities in Scotland and Ireland, C.1200-c.1650 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004), , p. 102. Scottish church music from the later Middle Ages was increasingly influenced by continental developments, with figures like 13th-century musical theorist Simon Tailler studying in Paris, before returned to Scotland where he introduced several reforms of church music.K. Elliott and F. Rimmer, A History of Scottish Music (London: British Broadcasting Corporation, 1973), , pp. 8‚Äì12. Scottish collections of music like the 13th-century 'Wolfenb√ºttel 677', which is associated with St Andrews, contain mostly French compositions, but with some distinctive local styles. The captivity of James I in England from 1406 to 1423, where he earned a reputation as a poet and composer, may have led him to take English and continental styles and musicians back to the Scottish court on his release. In the late 15th century a series of Scottish musicians trained in the Netherlands before returning home, including John Broune, Thomas Inglis and John Fety, the last of whom became master of the song school in Aberdeen and then Edinburgh, introducing the new five-fingered organ playing technique.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , pp. 58 and 118. In 1501 James IV refounded the Chapel Royal within Stirling Castle, with a new and enlarged choir and it became the focus of Scottish liturgical music. Burgundian and English influences were probably reinforced when Henry VII's daughter Margaret Tudor married James IV in 1503.M. Gosman, A. A. MacDonald, A. J. Vanderjagt and A. Vanderjagt, Princes and Princely Culture, 1450‚Äì1650 (Brill, 2003), , p. 163. James V (1512‚Äì42) was a major patron of music. A talented lute player, he introduced French chansons and consorts of viols to his court and was patron to composers such as David Peebles (c. 1510‚Äì1579?).J. Patrick, Renaissance and Reformation (London: Marshall Cavendish, 2007), , p. 1264. The Scottish Reformation, directly influenced by Calvinism, was generally opposed to church music, leading to the removal of organs and a growing emphasis on metrical psalms, including a setting by David Peebles commissioned by James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray. The most important work in Scottish reformed music was probably A forme of Prayers published in Edinburgh in 1564.R. M. Wilson, Anglican Chant and Chanting in England, Scotland, and America, 1660 to 1820 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996), , pp. 146‚Äì7 and 196‚Äì7. The return from France of James V's daughter, Mary, Queen of Scots in 1561, renewed the Scottish court as a centre of musical patronage and performance. The Queen played the lute, virginals and (unlike her father) was a fine singer.A. Frazer, Mary Queen of Scots (London: Book Club Associates, 1969), pp. 206‚Äì7. She brought many influences from the French court where she had been educated, employing lutenists and viol players in her household.M. Spring, The Lute in Britain: A History of the Instrument and Its Music (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006), , p. 452. Mary's position as a Catholic gave a new lease of life to the choir of the Scottish Chapel Royal in her reign, but the destruction of Scottish church organs meant that instrumentation to accompany the mass had to employ bands of musicians with trumpets, drums, fifes, bagpipes and tabors. The outstanding Scottish composer of the era was Robert Carver (c.1485‚Äìc.1570) whose works included the nineteen-part motet 'O Bone Jesu'. James VI, king of Scotland from 1567, was a major patron of the arts in general. He rebuilt the Chapel Royal at Stirling in 1594 and the choir was used for state occasions like the baptism of his son Henry.P. Le Huray, Music and the Reformation in England, 1549‚Äì1660 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1978), , pp. 83‚Äì5. He followed the tradition of employing lutenists for his private entertainment, as did other members of his family.T. Carter and J. Butt, The Cambridge History of Seventeenth-Century Music (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), , pp. 280, 300, 433 and 541. When he came south to take the throne of England in 1603 as James I, he removed one of the major sources of patronage in Scotland. The Scottish Chapel Royal was now used only for occasional state visits, as when Charles I returned in 1633 to be crowned, bringing many musicians from the English Chapel Royal for the service, and it began to fall into disrepair. From now on the court in Westminster would be the only major source of royal musical patronage. Folk music David Allan, 1780 There is evidence that there was a flourishing culture of popular music in Scotland during the late Middle Ages, but the only song with a melody to survive from this period is the \\"Pleugh Song\\".J. R. Baxter, \\"Music, ecclesiastical\\", in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 130‚Äì33. After the Reformation, the secular popular tradition of music continued, despite attempts by the kirk, particularly in the Lowlands, to suppress dancing and events like penny weddings.J. Porter, \\"Introduction\\" in J. Porter, ed., Defining Strains: The Musical Life of Scots in the Seventeenth Century (Peter Lang, 2007), , p. 22. This period saw the creation of the ce√≤l m√≥r (the great music) of the bagpipe, which reflected its martial origins, with battle-tunes, marches, gatherings, salutes and laments.J. E. A. Dawson, Scotland Re-Formed, 1488‚Äì1587 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), , p. 169. The Highlands the early seventeenth century saw the development of piping families including the MacCrimmonds, MacArthurs, MacGregors and the Mackays of Gairloch. There is also evidence of adoption of the fiddle in the Highlands with Martin Martin noting in his A Description of the Western Isles of Scotland (1703) that he knew of 18 players in Lewis alone.J. Porter, \\"Introduction\\" in J. Porter, ed., Defining Strains: The Musical Life of Scots in the Seventeenth Century (Peter Lang, 2007), , p. 35. Well-known musicians included the fiddler Pattie Birnie and the piper Habbie Simpson. This tradition continued into the nineteenth century, with major figures such as the fiddlers Neil and his son Nathaniel Gow.J. R. Baxter, \\"Culture, Enlightenment (1660‚Äì1843): music\\", in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 140‚Äì1. There is evidence of ballads from this period. Some may date back to the late Medieval era and deal with events and people that can be traced back as far as the thirteenth century.E. Lyle, Scottish Ballads (Edinburgh: Canongate Books, 2001), , pp. 9‚Äì10. They remained an oral tradition until they were collected as folk songs in the eighteenth century.\\"Popular Ballads\\" The Broadview Anthology of British Literature: The Restoration and the Eighteenth Century (Broadview Press, 2006), pp. 610‚Äì17. The earliest printed collection of secular music comes from the seventeenth century.M. Patrick, Four Centuries of Scottish Psalmody (Read books, 2008), pp. 119‚Äì20. Collection began to gain momentum in the early eighteenth century and, as the kirk's opposition to music waned, there were a flood of publications including Allan Ramsay's verse compendium The Tea Table Miscellany (1723) and The Scots Musical Museum (1787 to 1803) by James Johnson and Robert Burns.M. Gardiner, Modern Scottish Culture (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2005), pp. 193‚Äì4. From the late nineteenth century there was renewed interest in traditional music, which was more academic and political in intent.B. Sweers, Electric Folk: The Changing Face of English Traditional Music (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), , pp. 31‚Äì8. In Scotland collectors included the Reverend James Duncan and Gavin Greig. Major performers included James Scott Skinner.J. R. Baxter, \\"Music, Highland\\", in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 434‚Äì5. This revival began to have a major impact on classical music, with the development of what was in effect a national school of orchestral and operatic music in Scotland, with composers such as included Alexander Mackenzie, William Wallace, Learmont Drysdale, Hamish MacCunn and John McEwen.M. Gardiner, Modern Scottish Culture (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2005), , pp. 195‚Äì6. After World War II traditional music in Scotland was marginalised, but remained a living tradition. This marginal status was changed by individuals including Alan Lomax, Hamish Henderson and Peter Kennedy, through collecting, publications, recordings and radio programmes.B. Sweers, Electric Folk: The Changing Face of English Traditional Music (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), , pp. 256‚Äì7. Acts that were popularised included John Strachan, Jimmy MacBeath, Jeannie Robertson and Flora MacNeil.C. MacDougall, Scots: The Language of the People (Black & White, 2006), p. 246. In the 1960s there was a flourishing folk club culture and Ewan MacColl emerged as a leading figure in the revival in Britain.S. Broughton, M. Ellingham and R. Trillo, eds, World Music: Africa, Europe and the Middle East (London: Rough Guides, 1999), , pp. 261‚Äì3. They hosted traditional performers, including Donald Higgins and the Stewarts of Blairgowrie, beside English performers and new Scottish revivalists such as Robin Hall, Jimmie Macgregor, The Corries and the Ian Campbell Folk Group. There was also a strand of popular Scottish music that benefited from the arrival of radio and television, which relied on images of Scottishness derived from tartanry and stereotypes employed in music hall and variety. This was exemplified by the TV programme The White Heather Club which ran from 1958 to 1967, hosted by Andy Stewart and starring Moira Anderson and Kenneth McKellar.P. Simpson, The Rough Guide to Cult Pop (London: Rough Guides, 2003), , p. 140. The fusing of various styles of American music with British folk created a distinctive form of fingerstyle guitar playing known as folk baroque, pioneered by figures including Davey Graham and Bert Jansch. Others totally abandoned the traditional element including Donovan and The Incredible String Band, who have been seen as developing psychedelic folk. Acoustic groups who continued to interpret traditional material through into the 1970s included The Tannahill Weavers, Ossian, Silly Wizard, The Boys of the Lough, Battlefield Band, The Clutha and the Whistlebinkies.S. Broughton, M. Ellingham and R. Trillo, eds, World Music: Africa, Europe and the Middle East (London: Rough Guides, 1999), , pp. 267. Celtic rock developed as a variant of British folk rock by Scottish groups including the JSD Band and Spencer's Feat. Five Hand Reel, who combined Irish and Scottish personnel, emerged as the most successful exponents of the style.C. Larkin, The Guinness Encyclopedia of Popular Music (Guinness, 1992), p. 869. From the late 1970s the attendance at, and numbers of, folk clubs began to decrease, as new musical and social trends began to dominate. However, in Scotland the circuit of ceilidhs and festivals helped prop up traditional music. Two of the most successful groups of the 1980s that emerged from this dance band circuit were Runrig and Capercaillie.B. Sweers, Electric Folk: The Changing Face of English Traditional Music (Oxford University Press, 2005), , p. 259. A by-product of the Celtic Diaspora was the existence of large communities across the world that looked for their cultural roots and identity to their origins in the Celtic nations. From the US this includes Scottish bands Seven Nations, Prydein and Flatfoot 56. From Canada are bands such as Enter the Haggis, Great Big Sea, The Real McKenzies and Spirit of the West.J. Herman, \\"British Folk- Rock; Celtic Rock\\", The Journal of American Folklore, 107, (425), (1994) pp. 54‚Äì8. Classical music Thomas Erskine, 6th Earl of Kellie, the first Scot known to have produced a symphony The development of a distinct tradition of art music in Scotland was limited by the impact of the Scottish Reformation on ecclesiastical music from the sixteenth century. Concerts, largely composed of \\"Scottish airs\\", developed in the seventeenth century and classical instruments were introduced to the country. Music in Edinburgh prospered through the patronage of figures including the merchant Sir John Clerk of Penicuik. The Italian style of classical music was probably first brought to Scotland by the cellist and composer Lorenzo Bocchi, who travelled to Scotland in the 1720s.R. Cowgill and P. Holman, \\"Introduction: centres and peripheries\\", in R. Cowgill and P. Holman, eds, Music in the British Provinces, 1690‚Äì1914 (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2007), , p. 4. The Musical Society of Edinburgh was incorporated in 1728.E. G. Breslaw, Doctor Alexander Hamilton and Provincial America (Louisiana State University Press, 2008), , p. 41. Several Italian musicians were active in the capital in this period and there are several known Scottish composers in the classical style, including Thomas Erskine, 6th Earl of Kellie, the first Scot known to have produced a symphony.N. Wilson, Edinburgh (Lonely Planet, 3rd edn., 2004), , p. 33. In the mid-eighteenth century a group of Scottish composers including James Oswald and William McGibbon created the \\"Scots drawing room style\\", taking primarily Lowland Scottish tunes and making them acceptable to a middle class audience.M. Gelbart, The Invention of \\"Folk Music\\" and \\"Art Music\\" (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press), , p. 30. In the 1790s Robert Burns embarked on an attempt to produce a corpus of Scottish national song contributing about a third of the songs of The Scots Musical Museum.Donald A. Low, ed., The Songs of Robert Burns (London: Routledge, 1993), , p. 1054. Burns also collaborated with George Thomson in A Select Collection of Original Scottish Airs, which adapted Scottish folk songs with \\"classical\\" arrangements. However, Burns' championing of Scottish music may have prevented the establishment of a tradition of European concert music in Scotland, which faltered towards the end of the eighteenth century. From the mid-nineteenth century classical music began a revival in Scotland, aided by the visits of Chopin and Mendelssohn in the 1840s.A. C. Cheyne, \\"Culture: age of industry, (1843‚Äì1914), general\\", in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 143‚Äì6. By the late nineteenth century, there was in effect a national school of orchestral and operatic music in Scotland, with major composers including Alexander Mackenzie, William Wallace, Learmont Drysdale and Hamish MacCunn. Major performers included the pianist Frederic Lamond, and singers Mary Garden and Joseph Hislop.C. Harvie, No Gods and Precious Few Heroes: Twentieth-century Scotland (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1998), , pp. 136‚Äì8. After World War I, Robin Orr and Cedric Thorpe Davie were influenced by modernism and Scottish musical cadences. Erik Chisholm founded the Scottish Ballet Society and helped create several ballets.M. Gardiner, Modern Scottish Culture (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2005), , pp. 193‚Äì8. The Edinburgh Festival was founded in 1947 and led to an expansion of classical music in Scotland, leading to the foundation of Scottish Opera in 1960. Important post-war composers included Ronald Stevenson, Francis George Scott, Edward McGuire, William Sweeney, Iain Hamilton, Thomas Wilson, Thea Musgrave, Judith Weir, James MacMillan and Helen Grime. Craig Armstrong has produced music for numerous films. Major performers include the percussionist Evelyn Glennie. Major Scottish orchestras include: Royal Scottish National Orchestra (RSNO), the Scottish Chamber Orchestra (SCO) and the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra (BBC SSO). Major venues include Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, Usher Hall, Edinburgh and Queen's Hall, Edinburgh.J. Clough, K. Davidson, S. Randall, A. Scott, DK Eyewitness Travel Guide: Scotland: Scotland (London: Dorling Kindersley, 2012), , p. 108.N. Wilson, Edinburgh (London: Lonely Planet, 2004), , p. 137.J. S. Sawyers, Maverick Guide to Scotland (London: Pelican, 1999), , pp. 176‚Äì7. Pop, rock and fusion Annie Lennox, performing here as part of Eurythmics in the 1980s Pop and rock were slow to get started in Scotland and produced few bands of note in the 1950s or 1960s, though thanks to accolades by David Bowie and others, the Edinburgh-based band 1-2-3 (later Clouds), active 1966‚Äì71, have belatedly been acknowledged as a definitive precursor of the progressive rock movement.The Encyclopaedia of Popular Music (Muze publications) However, by the 1970s bands such as the Average White Band, Nazareth, and The Sensational Alex Harvey Band began to have international success. The biggest Scottish pop act of the 1970s however (at least in terms of sales) were undoubtedly the Bay City Rollers; a spinoff band formed by former Rollers members, Pilot, also enjoyed some success. Several of the members of the internationally successful rock band AC/DC were born in Scotland, including original lead singer Bon Scott and guitarists Malcolm and Angus Young, though by the time they began playing, all three had moved to Australia. George Young, Angus and Malcolm's older brother, found success as a member of the Australian band The Easybeats, later produced some of AC/DC's records and formed a songwriting partnership with Dutch expat Harry Vanda. Similarly Mark Knopfler and John Martyn were partly raised in Scotland. During the 1960s, Scotland contributed two innovative rock musicians who were central to the international scene; folk/psychedelia guitarist/singer/songwriter Donovan (Donovan Phillips Leitch), and blues-rock/jazz-rock bassist/composer Jack Bruce (John Symon Asher Bruce). Traces of Scottish literary and musical influences can be found in both Donovan's and Bruce's work.The Autobiography of Donovan; The Hurdy Gurdy ManJack Bruce; Composing Himself by Harry Shapiro Donovan's music on 1965's Fairytale anticipated the British folk rock revival. Donovan pioneered psychedelic rock with Sunshine Superman in 1966. Donovan's decidedly Celtic rock directions can be found on his later albums like Open Road and HMS Donovan. Donovan is said to be an early influence and encouragement for Marc Bolan founder of T. Rex. Jack Bruce co-founded Cream along with Eric Clapton and Ginger Baker in 1966, debuting with the album Fresh Cream. Fresh Cream and the launch of Cream are considered a pivotal moment in blues-rock history, introducing virtuosity and improvisation to the form. Bruce, as a member of The Tony Williams Lifetime (along with John McLaughlin and Larry Young) on Emergency!, similarly contributed to a seminal jazz-rock work that predated Bitches Brew by Miles Davis. Scotland produced a few punk bands of note, such as The Exploited, The Rezillos, The Skids, The Fire Engines, and the Scars. However, it was not until the post-punk era of the early 1980s, that Scotland really came into its own, with bands like Cocteau Twins, Orange Juice, The Associates, Simple Minds, Maggie Reilly, Annie Lennox (Eurythmics), Hue and Cry, Goodbye Mr Mackenzie, The Jesus and Mary Chain, Wet Wet Wet, Big Country, The Proclaimers and Josef K. Since the 1980s Scotland has produced several popular rock and alternative rock acts. Most recently, Scottish piping has included a renaissance for cauldwind pipes such as smallpipes and border pipes, which use cold, dry air as opposed to the moist air of mouth-blown pipes. Other pipers such as Gordon Duncan and Fred Morrison began to explore new musical genres on many kinds of pipes. The accordion also gained in popularity during the 1970s due to the renown of Phil Cunningham, whose distinctive piano accordion style was an integral part of the band Silly Wizard. Numerous musicians continued to follow more traditional styles including Alex Beaton. A more recent trend has been to fuse traditional Celtic with world music, rock and jazz (see Celtic fusion). This has been championed by musicians such as Shooglenifty, innovators of the house fusion acid croft, Peatbog Faeries, The Easy Club, jazz fusion bands, puirt √† beul mouth musicians Talitha MacKenzie and Martin Swan, pioneering singers Savourna Stevenson and Christine Primrose. Other modern musicians include the late techno-piper Martyn Bennett (who used hip hop beats and sampling), Hamish Moore, Roger Ball, Hamish Stuart, Jim Diamond and Sheena Easton. Scotland produced many indie bands in the 1980s, including Primal Scream, The Soup Dragons, The Jesus and Mary Chain, The Blue Nile, Teenage Fanclub, 18 Wheeler, The Pastels and BMX Bandits being some of the best examples. The following decade also saw a burgeoning scene in Glasgow, with the likes of The Almighty, Arab Strap, Belle and Sebastian, Camera Obscura, The Delgados, Bis and Mogwai. The late 1990s and 2000s saw Scottish guitar bands continue to achieve critical or commercial success, examples include Franz Ferdinand, Frightened Rabbit, Biffy Clyro, Texas, Travis, KT Tunstall, Amy Macdonald, Paolo Nutini, The View, Idlewild, Shirley Manson of Garbage, Glasvegas, We Were Promised Jetpacks, The Fratellis, and Twin Atlantic. Scottish extreme metal bands include Man Must Die and Cerebral Bore. One of the most famous and successful electronic music producers, Calvin Harris, is also Scottish. The Edinburgh- based group Young Fathers won the 2014 Mercury Prize for their album Dead. Jazz Scotland has a strong jazz tradition and has produced many world class musicians since the 1950s, notably Jimmy Deuchar, Bobby Wellins and Joe Temperley. A long-standing problem was the lack of opportunities within Scotland to play with international musicians. Since the 1970s this has been addressed by Edinburgh clubowner Bill Kyle (the JazzBar) and enthusiast-run organisations such as Platform and then Assembly Direct, which have provided improved performance opportunities. Perhaps the best known contemporary Scottish jazz musician is Tommy Smith. Again, the Edinburgh Jazz and Blues Festival brings some of the best jazz musicians in the world to Scotland every year, although, increasingly, other cities (such as Glasgow and Dundee) also run international jazz festivals. Instruments =Accordion= Though often derided as Scottish kitsch, the accordion has long been a part of Scottish music. Country dance bands, such as that led by the renowned Jimmy Shand, have helped to dispel this image. In the early 20th century, the melodeon (a variety of diatonic button accordion) was popular among rural folk, and was part of the bothy band tradition. More recently, performers like Phil Cunningham (of Silly Wizard) and Sandy Brechin have helped popularise the accordion in Scottish music. =Bagpipes= The Tannahill Weavers Though bagpipes are closely associated with Scotland by many outsiders, the instrument (or, more precisely, family of instruments) is found throughout large swathes of Europe, North Africa and South Asia. The most common bagpipe heard in modern Scottish music is the Great Highland Bagpipe, which was spread by the Highland regiments of the British Army. Historically, numerous other bagpipes existed, and many of them have been recreated in the last half- century. Also during the 19th century bagpipes were played on ships sailing off to war to keep the men's hopes up and to bring good luck in the coming war. Bagpipe band performing in a parade in the U.S. The classical music of the Great Highland Bagpipe is called P√¨obaireachd, which consists of a first movement called the urlar (in English, the 'ground' movement,) which establishes a theme. The theme is then developed in a series of movements, growing increasingly complex each time. After the urlar there is usually a number of variations and doublings of the variations. Then comes the taorluath movement and variation and the crunluath movement, continuing with the underlying theme. This is usually followed by a variation of the crunluath, usually the crunluath a mach (other variations: crunluath breabach and crunluath fosgailte) ; the piece closes with a return to the urlar. Bagpipe competitions are common in Scotland, for both solo pipers and pipe bands. Competitive solo piping is currently popular among many aspiring pipers, some of whom travel from as far as Australia to attend Scottish competitions. Other pipers have chosen to explore more creative usages of the instrument. Different types of bagpipes have also seen a resurgence since the 70s, as the historical border pipes and Scottish smallpipes have been resuscitated and now attract a thriving alternative piping community.Hamish Moore of Dunkeld ‚Äì maker of Scottish smallpipes and Highland bagpipes Two of Scotland's most highly regarded pipers are Gordon Duncan and Fred Morrison. The pipe band is another common format for highland piping, with top competitive bands including the Victoria Police Pipe Band from Australia (formerly), Northern Ireland's Field Marshal Montgomery, the Republic of Ireland's Laurence O'Toole pipe band, Canada's 78th Fraser Highlanders Pipe Band and Simon Fraser University Pipe Band, and Scottish bands like Shotts and Dykehead Pipe Band and Strathclyde Police Pipe Band. These bands, as well as many others, compete in numerous pipe band competitions, often the World Pipe Band Championships, and sometimes perform in public concerts. Skye Boat Song performed by Pipe Band. =Fiddle= Scottish traditional fiddling encompasses a number of regional styles, including the bagpipe-inflected west Highlands, the upbeat and lively style of Norse-influenced Shetland Islands and the Strathspey and slow airs of the North-East. The instrument arrived late in the 17th century, and is first mentioned in 1680 in a document from Newbattle Abbey in Midlothian, Lessones For Ye Violin. In the 18th century, Scottish fiddling is said to have reached new heights. Fiddlers like William Marshall and Niel Gow were legends across Scotland, and the first collections of fiddle tunes were published in mid-century. The most famous and useful of these collections was a series published by Nathaniel Gow, one of Niel's sons, and a fine fiddler and composer in his own right. Classical composers such as Charles McLean, James Oswald and William McGibbon used Scottish fiddling traditions in their Baroque compositions. Scottish fiddling is most directly represented in North America in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, an island on the east coast of Canada, which received some 25,000 emigrants from the Scottish Highlands during the Highland Clearances of 1780‚Äì1850. Cape Breton musicians such as Natalie MacMaster, Ashley MacIsaac, and Jerry Holland have brought their music to a worldwide audience, building on the traditions of master fiddlers such as Buddy MacMaster and Winston Scotty Fitzgerald. Among native Scots, Aly Bain and Alasdair Fraser are two of the most accomplished, following in the footsteps of influential 20th-century players such as James Scott Skinner, Hector MacAndrew, Angus Grant and Tom Anderson. The growing number of young professional Scottish fiddlers makes a complete list impossible. The Annual Scots Fiddle Festival which runs each November showcases the great fiddling tradition and talent in Scotland. =Guitar= The history of the guitar in traditional music is recent, as is that of the cittern and bouzouki introduced into Scottish music from Irish music by Irish folksinger Johnny Moynihan in the late 1960s.O'Toole, Leagues (2006). The Humours of Planxty. Ireland: Hodder Headline. . The guitar featured prominently in the folk revival of the early 1960s with the likes of Archie Fisher, the Corries, Hamish Imlach, Robin Hall and Jimmie Macgregor. The virtuoso playing of Bert Jansch was widely influential, and the range of instruments was widened by The Incredible String Band. Notable artists include Tony McManus, Dave MacIsaac, Peerie Willie Johnson and Dick Gaughan. Other notable guitarists in Scottish music scene include Kris Drever of Fine Friday and Lau, and Ross Martin of Cliar, D√†imh and Harem Scarem. Scotland has also produced several notable electric guitarists, including Stuart Adamson of Big Country (once referred to as \\"Britain's Jimi Hendrix\\"), Angus Young of AC/DC, Jimmy McCulloch of Wings, Manny Charlton of Nazareth, Zal Cleminson of The Sensational Alex Harvey band, and Brian Robertson of Thin Lizzy. =Harp= This Scottish cl√†rsach, known as the Cl√†rsach Lumanach or Lamont Harp made in the western Highlands (c.1400)Caldwell, D.H. (ed). Angels Nobles and Unicorns: Art and Patronage in Medieval Scotland. Edinburgh: NMS, 1982 now in the Museum of Scotland, is one of only three surviving medieval Gaelic harps. Material evidence suggests that lyres and/or harp, or clarsach, has a long and ancient history in Britain, with Iron Age lyres dating from 2300BC. The harp was regarded as the national instrument until it was replaced with the Highland bagpipes in the 15th century.Henry George Farmer (1947): A History of Music in Scotland London, 1947 p. 202. Stone carvings in the East of Scotland support the theory that the harp was present in Pictish Scotland well before the 9th century and may have been the original ancestor of the modern European harp and even formed the basis for Scottish pibroch, the folk bagpipe tradition. Barring illustrations of harps in the 9th century Utrecht psalter, only thirteen depictions exist in Europe of any triangular chordophone harp pre-11th century, and all thirteen of them come from Scotland. Pictish harps were strung from horsehair. The instruments apparently spread south to the Anglo- Saxons, who commonly used gut strings, and then west to the Gaels of the Highlands and Ireland. The earliest Irish word for a harp is in fact Cruit, a word which strongly suggests a Pictish provenance for the instrument. The surname MacWhirter, Mac a' Chruiteir, means son of the harpist, and is common throughout Scotland, but particularly in Carrick and Galloway. The Cl√†rsach (Gd.) or Cl√°irseach (Ga.) is the name given to the wire-strung harp of either Scotland or Ireland. The word begins to appear by the end of the 14th century. Until the end of the Middle Ages it was the most popular musical instrument in Scotland, and harpers were among the most prestigious cultural figures in the courts of Irish/Scottish chieftains and Scottish kings and earls. In both countries, harpers enjoyed special rights and played a crucial part in ceremonial occasions such as coronations and poetic bardic recitals. The Kings of Scotland employed harpers until the end of the Middle Ages, and they feature prominently in royal iconography. Several Clarsach players were noted at the Battle of the Standard (1138), and when Alexander III (died 1286) visited London in 1278, his court minstrels with him, records show payments were made to one Elyas, \\"King of Scotland's harper.\\" One of the nicknames for the Scottish harp is \\"taigh nan teud\\", the house of strings. Three medieval Gaelic harps survived into the modern period, two from Scotland (the Queen Mary Harp and the Lamont Harp) and one in Ireland (the Brian Boru harp), although artistic evidence suggests that all three were probably made in the western Highlands. The playing of this Gaelic harp with wire strings died out in Scotland in the 18th century and in Ireland in the early 19th century. As part of the late 19th century Gaelic revival, the instruments used differed greatly from the old wire-strung harps. The new instruments had gut strings, and their construction and playing style was based on the larger orchestral pedal harp. Nonetheless the name \\"cl√†rsach\\" was and is still used in Scotland today to describe these new instruments. The modern gut-strung cl√†rsach has thousands of players, both in Scotland and Ireland, as well as North America and elsewhere. The 1931 formation of the Clarsach Society kickstarted the modern harp renaissance. Recent harp players include Savourna Stevenson, Maggie MacInnes, and the band Sileas. Notable events include the Edinburgh International Harp Festival, which recently staged the world record for the largest number of harpists to play at the same time. =Tin whistle= Tin whistles in a variety of makes and keys. One of the oldest tin whistles still in existence is the Tusculum whistle, found with pottery dating to the 14th and 15th centuries; it is currently in the collection of the Museum of Scotland. Today the whistle is a very common instrument in recorded Scottish music. Although few well-known performers choose the tin whistle as their principal instrument, it is quite common for pipers, flute players, and other musicians to play the whistle as well. =Bodhran= The Irish word bodhr√°n (pronounced [ÀàbÀ†…ôu…æÀ†aÀênÃ™À†], plural bodhr√°in), indicating a drum, is first mentioned in a translated English document from Irish in the 17th century. The bodhran originated in south-west Ireland probably in the 18th century, known as the \\"poor man's tambourine\\" ‚Äì made from farm implements and without the cymbals, it was popular among mummers, or wren boys. A large oil painting by Irish artist Daniel Maclise (1806‚Äì1870) depicts a large Halloween house party in which a bodhr√°n features clearly.http://comhaltas.ie/music/treoir/detail/bodhran_its_origin_meaning_and_history/ The bodhran in Scotland and also Cape Breton, North mainland Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, and Prince Edward Island is an import from Ireland due to its popularity in 1960s because of the music of Se√°n √ì RiadaHast, Dorothea E. and Stanley Scott.

In 1974, she was named a \\"Companion of Literature\\", the highest honour given by the Royal Society of Literature. Career Pitter was born in Ilford. Her birth certificate reports her given name simply as \\"Ruth.\\"Don W. King, The Letters of Ruth Pitter: Silent Music, 2014, p. xxv. She was employed at the War Office from 1915 to 1917, later working as a painter at a furniture company in Suffolk, Walberswick Peasant Pottery Co., where she remained until 1930.Poems of Today, third series (1938), p. xxvii. In Suffolk, she befriended Richard and Ida Blair at Southwold, the parents of George Orwell, and later helped Orwell find lodgings in London in 1927, taking a vague interest in his writing, of which she was generally critical.Ruth Pitter, BBC Overseas Service broadcast, 3 January 1956. Later, Pitter and her lifelong good friend, Kathleen O'Hara, operated Deane and Forester, a small firm that specialised in decorative, painted furniture. The business closed when World War II began. Pitter took work in a factory. After the war, she and O'Hara opened a small business painting trays. Pitter was skilful at the flower-painting used in both furniture and tray decorating. From 1946 to 1972, she was often a guest on BBC radio programmes, and from 1956 to 1960 she appeared regularly on the BBC's The Brains Trust, one of the first television talk programmes. Poet Pitter began writing poetry early in life under the influence of her parents, George and Louisa (Murrell) Pitter, both primary schoolteachers. In 1920, she published her first book of poetry with the help of Hilaire Belloc. Despite her business and factory work, Pitter managed to spend a few hours a day writing poetry. She went on to publish 18 volumes of new and collected verse over a 70-year career as a published poet. Many of her volumes met with some critical and financial success. She received the Hawthornden Prize in 1937 for A Trophy of Arms, published the previous year. In 1954 she won the William E. Heinemann Award for her book The Ermine (Cresset Press, 1953). Style and influences Pitter was a traditionalist poet‚Äîshe avoided most of the experimentations of modern verse and preferred the meter and rhyme schemes of the 19th century. One critic has described her and her poetry thus: Because of this, Pitter was frequently overlooked by critics of her day, and has only in recent years been seen as important: her reputation was helped by Larkin's respect for her poetry (he included four of her poems in The Oxford Book of Twentieth Century English Verse). She was a good friend of C. S. Lewis, who admired her poetry and once said, according to his friend and biographer George Sayer, that if he was the kind of man who got married, he would have wanted to marry Ruth Pitter. In correspondence between the two, Lewis often critiqued her work and made suggestions.Don W. King, The anatomy of a friendship: the correspondence of Ruth Pitter and C. S. Lewis, 1946‚Äì1962. Mythlore, Summer, 2003. More often he invited her critique of his poems. Pitter is considered by many Lewis scholars to have had an effect on his writing in the 1940s and 1950s. W. B. Yeats, Robin Skelton and Thom Gunn also appreciated Pitter's work and praised her poetry. Lord David Cecil once remarked that Pitter was one of the most original and moving poets then living. Pitter's work continues to be published in anthologies, including: * The Faber Book of 20th Century Women's Poetry, ed.

Pipe bands are among the most recognizable forms of traditional Scottish music. Scottish folk music (also Scottish traditional music) is music that uses forms that are identified as part of the Scottish musical tradition. There is evidence that there was a flourishing culture of popular music in Scotland during the late Middle Ages, but the only song with a melody to survive from this period is the \\"Pleugh Song\\". After the Reformation, the secular popular tradition of music continued, despite attempts by the Kirk, particularly in the Lowlands, to suppress dancing and events like penny weddings. The first clear reference to the use of the Highland bagpipes mentions their use at the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547. The Highlands in the early seventeenth century saw the development of piping families including the MacCrimmons, MacArthurs, MacGregors and the Mackays of Gairloch. There is also evidence of adoption of the fiddle in the Highlands. Well-known musicians included the fiddler Pattie Birnie and the piper Habbie Simpson. This tradition continued into the nineteenth century, with major figures such as the fiddlers Neil and his son Nathaniel Gow. There is evidence of ballads from this period. Some may date back to the late Medieval era and deal with events and people that can be traced back as far as the thirteenth century. They remained an oral tradition until they were collected as folk songs in the eighteenth century. The earliest printed collection of secular music comes from the seventeenth century. Collection began to gain momentum in the early eighteenth century and, as the kirk's opposition to music waned, there were a flood of publications including Allan Ramsay's verse compendium The Tea Table Miscellany (1723) and The Scots Musical Museum (1787 to 1803) by James Johnson and Robert Burns. From the late nineteenth century there was renewed interest in traditional music, which was more academic and political in intent. In Scotland collectors included the Reverend James Duncan and Gavin Greig. Major performers included James Scott Skinner. This revival began to have a major impact on classical music, with the development of what was in effect a national school of orchestral and operatic music in Scotland, with composers such as included Alexander Mackenzie, William Wallace, Learmont Drysdale, Hamish MacCunn and John McEwen. After World War II traditional music in Scotland was marginalised, but remained a living tradition. This was changed by individuals including Alan Lomax, Hamish Henderson and Peter Kennedy, through collecting, publications, recordings and radio programmes. Acts that were popularised included John Strachan, Jimmy MacBeath, Jeannie Robertson and Flora MacNeil. In the 1960s there was a flourishing folk club culture and Ewan MacColl emerged as a leading figure in the revival in Britain. They hosted traditional performers, including Donald Higgins and the Stewarts of Blairgowrie, beside English performers and new Scottish revivalists such as Robin Hall, Jimmie Macgregor, The Corries and the Ian Campbell Folk Group. There was also a strand of popular Scottish music that benefited from the arrival of radio and television, which relied on images of Scottishness derived from tartanry and stereotypes employed in music hall and variety, exemplified by the TV programme The White Heather Club which ran from 1958 to 1967, hosted by Andy Stewart and starring Moira Anderson and Kenneth McKeller. The fusing of various styles of American music with British folk created a distinctive form of fingerstyle guitar playing known as folk baroque, pioneered by figures including Davy Graham and Bert Jansch. Others totally abandoned the traditional element including Donovan and the Incredible String Band, who have been seen as developing psychedelic folk. Acoustic groups who continued to interpret traditional material through into the 1970s included Ossian, Silly Wizard, The Boys of the Lough,The Natural Acoustic Band Battlefield Band, The Clutha and the Whistlebinkies. Celtic rock developed as a variant of British folk rock by Scottish groups including the JSD Band and Spencer's Feat. Five Hand Reel, who combined Irish and Scottish personnel, emerged as the most successful exponents of the style. From the late 1970s the attendance at, and numbers of, folk clubs began to decrease, as new musical and social trends began to dominate. However, in Scotland the circuit of ceilidhs and festivals helped prop up traditional music. Two of the most successful groups of the 1980s that emerged from this dance band circuit were Runrig and Capercaillie. A by-product of the Celtic Diaspora was the existence of large communities across the world that looked for their cultural roots and identity to their origins in the Celtic nations. From the United States this includes Scottish bands Seven Nations, Prydein and Flatfoot 56. From Canada are bands such as Enter the Haggis, Great Big Sea, The Real Mckenzies and Spirit of the West. Development David Allan, 1780 There is evidence that there was a flourishing culture of popular music in Scotland in the Late Middle Ages. This includes the long list of songs given in The Complaynt of Scotland (1549). Many of the poems of this period were also originally songs, but for none has a notation of their music survived. Melodies have survived separately in the post-Reformation publication of The Gude and Godlie Ballatis (1567),J. R. Baxter, \\"Music, ecclesiastical\\", in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 130‚Äì33. which were spiritual satires on popular songs, adapted and published by the brothers James, John and Robert Wedderburn.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , pp. 187‚Äì90. The only song with a melody to survive from this period is the \\"Pleugh Song\\". After the Reformation, the secular popular tradition of music continued, despite attempts by the Kirk, particularly in the Lowlands, to suppress dancing and events like penny weddings at which tunes were played.J. Porter, \\"Introduction\\" in J. Porter, ed., Defining Strains: The Musical Life of Scots in the Seventeenth Century (Peter Lang, 2007), , p. 22. The first clear reference to the use of the Highland bagpipes is from a French history, which mentions their use at the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547. George Buchanan claimed that they had replaced the trumpet on the battlefield. This period saw the creation of the ce√≤l m√≥r (the great music) of the bagpipe, which reflected its martial origins, with battle-tunes, marches, gatherings, salutes and laments.J. E. A. Dawson, Scotland Re-Formed, 1488‚Äì1587 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), , p. 169. The Highlands in the early seventeenth century saw the development of piping families including the MacCrimmonds, MacArthurs, MacGregors and the Mackays of Gairloch. There is also evidence of adoption of the fiddle in the Highlands with Martin Martin noting in his A Description of the Western Isles of Scotland (1703) that he knew of eighteen players in Lewis alone.J. Porter, \\"Introduction\\" in J. Porter, ed., Defining Strains: The Musical Life of Scots in the Seventeenth Century (Peter Lang, 2007), , p. 35. Well-known musicians included the fiddler Pattie Birnie (c. 1635‚Äì1721) and the piper Habbie Simpson (1550‚Äì1620). This tradition continued into the nineteenth century, with major figures such as the fiddlers Neil (1727‚Äì1807) and his son Nathaniel Gow (1763‚Äì1831), who, along with a large number of anonymous musicians, composed hundreds of fiddle tunes and variations.J. R. Baxter, \\"Culture, Enlightenment (1660‚Äì1843): music\\", in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 140‚Äì1. There is evidence of ballads from this period. Some may date back to the late Medieval era and deal with events and people that can be traced back as far as the thirteenth century, including \\"Sir Patrick Spens\\" and \\"Thomas the Rhymer\\", but for which there is no evidence until the eighteenth century.E. Lyle, Scottish Ballads (Edinburgh: Canongate Books, 2001), , pp. 9‚Äì10. Scottish ballads are distinct, showing some pre-Christian influences in the inclusion of supernatural elements such as the fairies in the Scottish ballad \\"Tam Lin\\".\\"Popular Ballads\\" The Broadview Anthology of British Literature: The Restoration and the Eighteenth Century (Broadview Press, 2006), , pp. 610‚Äì17. They remained an oral tradition until the increased interest in folk songs in the eighteenth century led collectors such as Bishop Thomas Percy to publish volumes of popular ballads. Early song collection Cover of John Playford's Collection of original Scotch-tunes, (full of the highland humours) for the violin (1700) In Scotland the earliest printed collection of secular music was by publisher John Forbes, produced in Aberdeen in 1662 as Songs and Fancies: to Thre, Foure, or Five Partes, both Apt for Voices and Viols. It was printed three times in the next twenty years, and contained seventy-seven songs, of which twenty-five were of Scottish origin.P. Millar, Four Centuries Of Scottish Psalmody (1949, Read Books, 2008), , pp. 119‚Äì120. In the eighteenth century publications included John Playford's Collection of original Scotch-tunes, (full of the highland humours) for the violin (1700), Margaret Sinkler's Music Book (1710), James Watson's Choice Collection of Comic and Serious Scots Poems both Ancient and Modern 1711. The oppression of secular music and dancing by the kirk began to ease between about 1715 and 1725 and the level of musical activity was reflected in a flood musical publications in broadsheets and compendiums of music such as the makar Allan Ramsay's verse compendium The Tea Table Miscellany (1723), William Thomson's Orpheus Caledonius: or, A collection of Scots songs (1733), James Oswald's The Caledonian Pocket Companion (1751), and David Herd's Ancient and modern Scottish songs, heroic ballads, etc.: collected from memory, tradition and ancient authors (1776). These were drawn on for the most influential collection, The Scots Musical Museum published in six volumes from 1787 to 1803 by James Johnson and Robert Burns, which also included new words by Burns. The Select Scottish Airs collected by George Thomson and published between 1799 and 1818 included contributions from Burns and Walter Scott.M. Gardiner, Modern Scottish Culture (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2005), , pp. 193‚Äì4. Among Scott's early works was the influential collection of ballads Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border (1802‚Äì03).K. S. Whetter, Understanding Genre and Medieval Romance (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2008) , p. 28 Revivals =First revival= Francis James Child, one of the key figures in beginning the first folk revival From the late nineteenth century there was renewed interest in traditional music, which was more academic and political in intent. Harvard professor Francis James Child's (1825‚Äì96) eight-volume collection The English and Scottish Popular Ballads (1882‚Äì92) has been the most influential on defining the repertoire of subsequent performers and the English music teacher Cecil Sharp was probably the most important in understanding of the nature of folk song.B. Sweers, Electric Folk: The Changing Face of English Traditional Music (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), , pp. 31‚Äì8. In Scotland collectors included the Reverend James Duncan (1848‚Äì1917) and Gavin Greig (1856‚Äì1914), who collected over 1,000 songs, mainly from Aberdeenshire.K. Mathieson, Celtic Music (Backbeat Books, 2001), , p. 55. The tradition continued with figures including James Scott Skinner (1843‚Äì1927), known as the \\"Strathspey King\\", who played the fiddle in venues ranging from the local functions in his native Banchory, to urban centres of the south and at Balmoral. In 1923 the Royal Scottish Country Dance Society was founded in an attempt to preserve traditional Scottish dance that were threatened by the introduction of the continental ballroom dances such as the waltz or quadrilles. The accordion also began to be a central instrument at Highland balls and dances.J. R. Baxter, \\"Music, Highland\\", in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 434‚Äì5. This revival began to have a major impact on classical music, with the development of what was in effect a national school of orchestral and operatic music in Scotland. Major composers included Alexander Mackenzie (1847‚Äì1935), William Wallace (1860‚Äì1940), Learmont Drysdale (1866‚Äì1909), Hamish MacCunn (1868‚Äì1916) and John McEwen (1868‚Äì1948).Gardiner, Modern Scottish Culture, pp. 195‚Äì6. Mackenzie, who studied in Germany and Italy and mixed Scottish themes with German Romanticism,\\"Alexander Mackenzie\\" Scottish Composers: the Land With Music, retrieved 11 May 2012. is best known for his three Scottish Rhapsodies (1879‚Äì80, 1911), Pibroch for violin and orchestra (1889) and the Scottish Concerto for piano (1897), all involving Scottish themes and folk melodies. Wallace's work included an overture, In Praise of Scottish Poesie (1894).J. Stevenson, \\"William Wallace\\", Allmusic, retrieved 11 May 2011. Drysdale's work often dealt with Scottish themes, including the overture Tam O‚Äô Shanter (1890), the cantata The Kelpie (1891).\\"Learmont-Drysdale\\" Scottish Composers: the Land With Music, retrieved 11 May 2012. MacCunn's overture The Land of the Mountain and the Flood (1887), his Six Scotch Dances (1896), his operas Jeanie Deans (1894) and Dairmid (1897) and choral works on Scottish subjects have been described by I. G. C. Hutchison as the musical equivalent of the Scots Baronial castles of Abbotsford and Balmoral.I. G. C. Hutchison, \\"Workshop of Empire: The Nineteenth Century\\" in J. Wormald, ed., Scotland: A History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), , p. 197. Similarly, McEwen's Pibroch (1889), Border Ballads (1908) and Solway Symphony (1911) incorporated traditional Scottish folk melodies.Gardiner, Modern Scottish Culture, p. 196. =Second revival= The bust of Hamish Henderson in South Gyle After World War II traditional music in Scotland was marginalised, but, unlike in England, it remained a much stronger force, with the C√©ilidh house still present in rural communities until the early 1950s and traditional material still performed by the older generation, even if the younger generation tended to prefer modern styles of music. This decline was changed by the actions of individuals such as American musicologist Alan Lomax, who collected numerous songs in Scotland that were issued by Columbia Records around 1955. Radio broadcasts by Lomax, Hamish Henderson and Peter Kennedy (1922‚Äì2006) were also important in raising awareness of the tradition, particularly Kennedy's As I Roved Out, which was largely based around Scottish and Irish music. The School of Scottish Studies was founded at University of Edinburgh in 1951, with Henderson as a research fellow and a collection of songs begun by Calum Maclean (1915‚Äì60).Sweers, Electric Folk, pp. 256‚Äì7. Acts that were popularised included John Strachan (1875‚Äì1958), Jimmy MacBeath (1894‚Äì1972), Jeannie Robertson (1908‚Äì75) and Flora MacNeil (1928-2015).C. MacDougall, Scots: The Language of the People (Black & White, 2006), , p. 246. A number festivals also popularised the music, such as Edinburgh People's Festival (1951‚Äì53) and Aberdeen Folk Festival (1963‚Äì). In the 1960s there was a flourishing folk club culture. The first folk club was founded in London by Ewan MacColl (1915‚Äì89), who emerged as a leading figure in the revival in Britain, recording influential records such as Scottish Popular Ballads (1956). Scottish folk clubs were less dogmatic than their English counterparts, which rapidly moved to an all English folk song policy, and continued to encourage a mixture of Scottish, Irish, English and American material. Early on they hosted traditional performers, including Donald Higgins and the Stewarts of Blairgowrie, beside English performers and new Scottish revivalists such as Robin Hall (1936‚Äì98), Jimmie Macgregor (born 1930) and The Corries. A number of these new performers, including the Ian Campbell Folk Group, emerged from the skiffle movement. There was also a strand of popular Scottish music that benefited from the arrival of radio and television, which relied on images of Scottishness derived from tartanry and stereotypes employed in music hall and variety. Proponents included Andy Stewart (1933‚Äì93), whose weekly programme The White Heather Club ran in Scotland from 1958 to 1967. Frequent guests included Moira Anderson (born 1938) and Kenneth McKeller (1927‚Äì2010), who enjoyed their own programmes.P. Simpson, The Rough Guide to Cult Pop (London: Rough Guides, 2003), , p. 140. The programmes and their music were immensely popular, although their version of Scottish music and identity was despised by many modernists.C. Craig, \\"Culture: modern times (1914‚Äì): the novel\\", in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 157‚Äì9. The fusing of various styles of American music with British folk created a distinctive form of fingerstyle guitar playing known as folk baroque, pioneered by figures including Davy Graham and Bert Jansch. This led in part to British progressive folk music, which attempted to elevate folk music through greater musicianship, or compositional and arrangement skills. Many progressive folk performers continued to retain a traditional element in their music, including Jansch who became a member of the band Pentangle in 1967. Others largely abandoned the traditional element of their music. Particularly important were Donovan (who was most influenced by emerging progressive folk musicians in America such as Bob Dylan) and the Incredible String Band, who from 1967 incorporated a range of influences including medieval and Eastern music into their compositions, leading to the development of psychedelic folk, which had a considerable impact on progressive and psychedelic rock.J. DeRogatis, Turn on Your Mind: Four Decades of Great Psychedelic Rock (Milwaukie MI, Hal Leonard, 2003), , p. 120. Acoustic groups who continued to interpret traditional material through into the 1970s included Ossian and Silly Wizard.S. Broughton, M. Ellingham and R. Trillo, eds, World Music: Africa, Europe and the Middle East (London: Rough Guides, 1999), , pp. 267. The Boys of the Lough and Battlefield Band, emerged from the flourishing Glasgow folk scene. Also from this scene were the highly influential The Clutha, whose line up, with two fiddlers, was later augmented by the piper Jimmy Anderson, and the Whistlebinkies, who pursued a strongly instrumental format, relying on traditional instruments, including a Cl√†rsach (Celtic harp).Broughton, Ellingham and Trillo, World Music: Africa, Europe and the Middle East, pp. 261‚Äì3. Many of these groups played largely music originating from the Lowlands, while later, more successful bands tended to favor the Gaelic sounds of the Highlands. While fairly popular within folk circles, none of these groups achieved the success of Irish groups such as The Chieftains and The Dubliners. Some of these bands produced noted solo artists, including Andy M. Stewart of Silly Wizard, Brian McNeill of Battlefield Band, and Dougie MacLean of the Tannahill Weavers. MacLean is perhaps the best known of these, having written \\"Caledonia,\\" one of Scotland's most beloved songs. Though perhaps not as popular as some of their Celtic fusion counterparts, traditional Scottish artists are still making music. These include Hebridean singer Julie Fowlis, 'Gaelic supergroup' D√†imh, and Lau. Old Blind Dogs have also found success singing in the Doric Scots dialect of their native Aberdeenshire. Albannach has gained recognition for their distinctive combination of pipes and drums. =Celtic rock= Dick Gaughan live at the \\"R√§tsche\\" in Geislingen/Steige (Germany) in 2006 Celtic rock developed as a variant of British folk rock, playing traditional Scottish folk music with rock instrumentation, developed by Fairport Convention and its members from 1969. Donovan used the term \\"Celtic rock\\" to describe the folk rock he created for his Open Road album in 1970, featured a song with \\"Celtic rock\\" as its title.D. Leitch, The Autobiography of Donovan: The Hurdy Gurdy Man (Macmillan, 2007), , p. 259. The adoption of British folk rock heavily influenced by Scottish traditional music produced groups including the JSD Band The Natural Acoustic Band (1970)and Spencer's Feat. Out of the wreckage of the latter in 1974, guitarist Dick Gaughan (born 1948) formed probably the most successful band in this genre Five Hand Reel, who combed Irish and Scottish personnel, before he embarked on an influential solo career.C. Larkin, The Guinness Encyclopedia of Popular Music (Guinness, 1992), , p. 869. From the late 1970s the attendance at, and numbers of, folk clubs began to decrease, as new musical and social trends, including punk rock, new wave and electronic music began to dominate. However, in Scotland the circuit of ceilidhs and festivals helped prop up traditional music. Two of the most successful groups of the 1980s emerged from this dance band circuit. From 1978, when they began to release original albums, Runrig produced highly polished Scottish folk rock, including the first commercially successful album with the all Gaelic Play Gaelic in 1978.J. S. Sawyers, Celtic Music: A Complete Guide (Da Capo Press, 2001), , p. 366. From the 1980s Capercaillie combined Scottish folk music, electric instruments and haunting vocals to considerable success.Sweers, Electric Folk, p. 259. While bagpipes had become an essential element in Scottish folk bands they were much rarer in folk rock outfits, but were successfully integrated into their sound by Wolfstone from 1989, who focused on a combination of highland music and rock.‚ÄôWolfstone ‚Äì Honest endeavour‚Äô Living Tradition, 43 (May/June 2001), retrieved 22/01/09. More recently, bands such as M√†nran and Tide Lines have also focused on a combination of Celtic music and pop-rock. Additionally, groups such as Shooglenifty and Peatbog Faeries mixed traditional highland music with more modern sounds, such as dubstep rhythms, creating a genre sometimes referred to as \\"Acid Croft\\". Niteworks inspired the two aforementioned bands and the electronic sampling of Martyn Bennett have further developed Celtic electronic music which has been described as both Gaelictronica and Celtictronica. Successful Scottish stadium rock acts such as Simple Minds from Glasgow and Big Country from Dunfermline incorporated traditional Celtic sounds onto many of their songs. The former based their hit \\"Belfast Child\\" around the traditional Irish song \\"She Moved Through the Fair\\" and incorporated accordion into their line-up, while the latter's guitar and drum sounds on their early albums were heavily influenced by Scottish pipe bands, particularly on songs such as \\"In a Big Country\\" and \\"Fields of Fire.\\" Big Country also covered Robert Burns' \\"Killiecrankie.\\" One by-product of the Celtic Diaspora was the existence of large communities across the world that looked for their cultural roots and identity to their origins in the Celtic nations. While it seems young musicians from these communities usually chose between their folk culture and mainstream forms of music such as rock or pop, after the advent of Celtic punk relatively large numbers of bands began to emerge styling themselves as Celtic rock. This is particularly noticeable in the United States and Canada, where there are large communities descended from Irish and Scottish immigrants. From the U.S. this includes Seven Nations, Prydein and Flatfoot 56. From Canada are bands such as Enter the Haggis, Great Big Sea, The Real Mckenzies and Spirit of the West. These groups were influenced by American forms of music, some containing members with no Celtic ancestry and commonly singing in English.J.

It is located on Clement's Lane, off King William Street and close to London Bridge and the River Thames.See an aerial view at Wikimapia < http://www.wikimapia.org/#lat=51.511337&lon;=-0.086877&z;=20&l;=0&m;=h&v;=2 >, accessed 1 August 2008 Clement was a disciple of St Peter the Apostle and was ordained as Bishop of Rome in the year 93 AD. By legend, Clement was martyred by being tied to an anchor and thrown into the Black Sea, which led to his adoption as a patron saint of sailors. The dedication to St Clement is unusual in London, with only one other ancient church there dedicated to this saint, namely St Clement Danes, Westminster. It is also located a little north of the Thames, but further west from Eastcheap and outside the old City boundary, just beyond the Temple Bar on the Strand.  History  =Medieval period= Eastcheap was one of the main streets of medieval London. The name 'Eastcheap' derives from the Saxon word 'cheap', meaning a market, and Eastcheap was so called to distinguish it from Westcheap, later to become Cheapside. The southern end of Clement's Lane opened onto Eastcheap until the 1880s when the construction of King William Street separated Clement's Lane from Eastcheap, which still remains nearby as a street. The parish of St. Clement Eastcheap, London, and its surrounding area as shown in Johann Homann's 'Ad Norman prototypi Londinensis edita curis Homannianorum Heredum C.P.S.C.M', Homann Heirs: London (1736) The church's dedication to a Roman patron saint of sailors, the martyr Bishop Clement, coupled with its location near to what were historically the bustling wharves of Roman London, hints at a much earlier Roman origin. Indeed, Roman remains were once found in Clement's Lane, comprising walls 3 feet thick and made of flints at a depth of 12‚Äì15 feet together with tessellated pavements.Harben, H. A. (1918) A Dictionary of London London: Jenkins A charter of 1067 given by William I (1028‚Äì87) to Westminster Abbey mentions a church of St. Clement, which is possibly St. Clement Eastcheap, but the earliest definite reference to the church is found in a deed written in the reign of Henry III (1207‚Äì72), which mentions 'St Clement Candlewickstrate'. Other early documents refer to the church as \\"St Clement in Candlewystrate\\", 'St Clement the Little by Estchepe' and 'St Clement in Lumbard Street'. Until the dissolution of the monasteries ‚Äì during the reign of Henry VIII ‚Äì the parish was in the 'gift' of the Abbot of Westminster, then patronage of the parish passed to the Bishop of London. Now the patronage alternates with the appointment of each successive new parish priest (Rector), between the Bishop of London and the Dean and Chapter of St Paul's. According to the London historian John Strype (1643‚Äì1737) St. Clement's church was repaired and beautified in 1630 and 1633.*Strype, John (1720) A survey of the Cities of London and Westminster ... brought down from the year 1633 ... to the present time London: Churchill et al. =Destruction and rebuilding= Clement's Lane, 1831, looking south, engraved by Thomas Hosmer Shepherd (1793‚Äì1864). Clement's Lane, the small thoroughfare on which the church is located, is named after the church.In 1666 the church was destroyed by the Great Fire of London, and then rebuilt in the 1680s. According to Strype the rebuilt church was designed by Sir Christopher Wren and this would seem to be confirmed by the fact that in the parish account for 1685 there is the following item: To one third of a hogshead of wine, given to Sir Christopher Wren, ¬£4 2s.Thornbury, Walter (1878) 'Bartholomew Lane and Lombard Street' in Old and New London: Volume 1 pp. 522‚Äì530. British History Online (University of London) < http://www.british- history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=45063 > accessed 3 November 2007 In 1670, during the rebuilding of London that followed the fire, the parish was combined with that of St Martin Orgar, which lay on the south side of Eastcheap. At the same time the City planners sought to appropriate a strip of land from the west of St Clement's property to widen Clement's Lane. This led to a dispute with the parish authorities, who claimed that the proposed plan left too little room to accommodate the families of the newly combined parishes. The matter was resolved by permitting the addition of a 14 ft. building plot, formerly occupied by the churchyard, to the east of the church. It was not until 1683, however, that building of the church began,\\"The City Churches\\" Tabor, M. p71:London; The Swarthmore Press Ltd; 1917 and was completed in 1687 at a total cost of ¬£4,365.Bradley, Simon & Pevsner, Nikolaus (1997) London (vol. 1, The City of London). Series: The Buildings of England. London: Penguin Although nearby St Martin Orgar had been left in ruins by the Great Fire, the tower survived and, following the unification of the parish with St Clement's, the St Martin's site was used by French Huguenots who restored the tower and worshiped there until 1820. Later in the decade the ruins of the body of St Martin's church were removed to make way for the widening of Cannon Street, but the tower remained until 1851 when it was taken down, and ‚Äì curiously ‚Äì replaced with a new tower. The new tower served as a rectory for St. Clement Eastcheap until it was sold and converted into offices in the 1970s; it still survives on the present-day Martin Lane. =19th century= Martin's Lane, looking north past St Martin Orgar church, 1831, engraved by Thomas Hosmer Shepherd (1793‚Äì1864) In May 1840 Edward John Carlos wrote in The Gentleman's Magazine, protesting about the proposed demolition of St Bartholomew-by-the-Exchange and St. Benet Fink, following a fire in 1838 that had razed the Royal Exchange and damaged those two churches. In his article, Carlos referred to earlier plans to reduce the number of City churches, from which we learn that in the 1830s St Clement's had been under threat of demolition. > The sweeping design of destroying a number of City churches was mediated in > ‚Ä¶ 1834, and for the time arrested by the resolute opposition to the measure > in the instance of the first church marked out for sacrifice, St. Clement > Eastcheap, it may be feared is at length coming into full operation, not, > indeed in the open manner in which it was displayed at that period, but in > an insidious and more secure mode of procedure. While St Clement's was spared, the 19th century saw many other City churches being destroyed, particularly following the Union of Benefices Act (1860), which sought to speed-up the reduction in the number of City parishes as a response to rapidly declining congregations; the result of the resident population moving in ever larger numbers from cramped City conditions to the more spacious suburbs. In 1872 William Butterfield, a prominent architect of the gothic-revival, substantially renovated St. Clement's to conform with the contemporary Anglican 'High Church' taste.\\"The Visitors Guide to the City of London Churches\\" Tucker,T: London, Friends of the City Churches, 2006 The renovation involved removing the galleries; replacing the 17th-century plain windows with stained glass; dividing the reredos into three pieces and placing the two wings on the side walls; dismantling the woodwork to build new pews; laying down polychrome tiles on the floor, and moving the organ into the aisle. =20th century= St Clement, Eastcheap: the reredos in May 2008In 1933 the architect Sir Ninian Comper revised Butterfield's layout, moving the organ to its original position on the west wall and reassembling the reredos behind the altar, although before he did so, he had the reredos painted with figures in blue and gold. St. Clement's suffered minor damage from bombing by German aircraft during the London Blitz in 1940 during the Second World War. The damage was repaired in 1949‚Äì50, and in 1968 the church was again redecorated. =Present= Today St Clement's holds weekly services and, from 1998 to 2011, it was the base of The Players of St Peter, an amateur theatre company devoted to performing medieval mystery plays in the church, around early December each year.The Players of St Peter, official web sitesite < http://www.theplayersofstpeter.org.uk/>, accessed 1 August 2008; The Players of St Peter: the alternative menu to the official site and the official menu to the alternative site < >, accessed 1 August 2008. The Players are now based at the church of St George in the East. N-Town plays, performed by the Players of St Peter in St Clement's, 2004 A number of charities have their administrative offices at St Clement's. The Cure Parkinson's Trust was based here for several years but is now at 120 Baker Street, London.  \\"Oranges and Lemons\\"  St Clement Eastcheap considers itself to be the church referred to in the nursery rhyme that begins \\"Oranges and lemons / Say the bells of St Clement's\\". So too does St Clement Danes Church, Westminster, whose bells ring out the traditional tune of the nursery rhyme three times a day. There is a canard that the earliest mention of the rhyme occurs in Wynkyn de Worde's \\"The demaundes joyous\\" printed in 1511.de Worde, Wynkyn (1511) The Demaundes Joyous (1971 facsimile edition with notes by John Wardroper) London: Gordon Fraser This small volume consists entirely of riddles and makes no allusion to bells, St. Clement or any other church. According to Iona and Peter Opie,*Opie, Iona and Opie, Peter (eds.) (1997) The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes Oxford: Oxford University Press the earliest record of the rhyme only dates to c.1744, although there is a square dance (without words) called 'Oranges and Limons' in the 3rd edition of John Playford's The English Dancing Master, published in 1665. St Clement Eastcheap's claim is based on the assertion that it was close to the wharf where citrus fruit was unloaded. Yet, a perusal of a map of London shows that there were many churches, even after the Fire, that were closer to the Thames than St. Clement's (St. George Botolph Lane, St Magnus the Martyr, St. Michael, Crooked Lane, St Martin Orgar, St Mary-at-Hill, All Hallows the Great. All these would have been passed by a load of oranges and lemons making its way to Leadenhall Market, the nearest market where citrus fruit was sold, passing several more churches on the way. Thus, it would appear that the name of St. Clements was selected by the rhymer simply for its consonance with the word ‚Äòlemons‚Äô, and it now seems more likely that the melody called ‚ÄòOranges and Limons‚Äô predates the rhyme itself. Oranges and Lemons was most recently featured in the 2017 adaptation of the Stephen King novel It. In the film It, composer Benjamin Wallfisch used the haunting rhyme to open the recorded score, which was released by Watertower Music after the film's release and is available on digital, vinyl and compact disc formats  Building  The facade of St Clement's church, c.1760, from Walter Harrison's History of London (1777) St. Clement Eastcheap has an irregular plan. The nave is approximately rectangular, but the south aisle is severely tapered. The ceiling is divided into panels, the centre one being a large oval band of fruit and flowers. The main fa√ßade is on the west, on Clement's Lane, and comprises four bays. The main bay has a blocked pedimented round-headed window over the door. This is flanked by matching bays with two levels of windows. The tower to the south west forms the fourth bay. This is a simple square tower, with a parapet, but no spire. Each bay has stone quoins and is stuccoed, except for the upper levels of the tower where the brick is exposed. A small churchyard remains to the east of St. Clement's hemmed-in by the backs of office buildings and contains tombstones whose inscriptions have, over time, become illegible. The churchyard is approached by a narrow alley along the church's north wall, at the entrance of which is a memorial plaque to Dositej Obradoviƒá, a Serbian scholar who lived next to the church.\\\\----- 'Candelwick Ward' in London Burial Grounds < http://www.doubleo.fsnet.co.uk/bgcandlewick.htm >, accessed 31 December 2007 In July 1645, so it is said, the poet John Milton was reconciled with his estranged wife Mary Powell, in the house of a Mrs Weber, a widow, in St Clement's churchyard where Mary was then lodging. Milton's description in Paradise Lost of the reconciliation of Adam and Eve draws, apparently, on the real life reconciliation between Milton and his wife.Thornbury, Walter (1878)'Aldersgate Street and St Martin-le-Grand'in Old and New London: Volume 2 pp. 208‚Äì228.

G. W. (2008) 'St Clement Eastcheap' in The Organ Club Journal 2008/1 47 While the case has remained largely intact, the organ itself has been variously rebuilt and restored; in 1704 by Christian Smith, and in 1711 by Abraham Jordan (c.1666‚Äì1716)‚Äîwho it is thought added the swell organ to the two manual instrument. From 1838 the organ was in the care of Messrs Gray and Davison, who in 1872‚Äîas part of the renovation of the building‚Äîmoved the organ from the west gallery to the south aisle. Care of the organ was transferred to Henry Wedlake that same year. In 1889 he rebuilt the instrument. Further work was undertaken in 1926 by Messrs J. W. Walker, and in 1936 by Messrs Hill, Norman and Beard, whew the instrument was moved back to an approximation of its original west-end location. The same company overhauled the organ in 1946, and in 1971 made 'neo-baroque' tonal revisions, which remain to this day. The instrument was last cleaned and repaired in 2004 by Colin Jilks of Sittingbourne, Kent.

Furnishings  The altar, with cherubs for legs, dates from the 17th century, as does the reredos, which was decorated during the 1930s restoration of the building in a style reminiscent of Simone Martini. The outer panels depict the Annunciation while the central panel shows St. Clement and St. Martin of Tours, (the dedicatee of St. Martin Orgar). The pulpit also dates from the 17th-century, and is made from Norwegian oak, topped with an hexagonal sounding board, with a dancing cherub on each corner. Surviving from the 1872 Butterfield renovation are the polychrome floor and three stained- glass clerestory windows on the north wall. The windows were made by W. G.

The diarist John Evelyn heard John Pearson (1613‚Äì86), later to be Bishop of Chester, preaching at St Clement's where he was the weekly preacher from 1654. His sermons there later became his An Exposition of the Creed (1659), which he dedicated \\"to the right worshipful and well-beloved, the parishioners of St. Clement's, Eastcheap.\\" One of the rectors of St. Clement's, Benjamin Stone, who had been presented to the living by Bishop Juxon, being deemed \\"too Popish\\" by Oliver Cromwell, was imprisoned for some time at Crosby Hall. From there he was sent to Plymouth where, after paying a fine of ¬£60, he obtained his liberty. Stone recovered his benefice on the restoration of Charles II but died five years after. (Thornbury, volume 1) In this church Josias Alsopp, who had succeeded Stone as rector in the early Restoration years of the 17th century, was heard preaching by Samuel Pepys who noted the following in his diary for 24 November 1661: > Up early, and by appointment to St. Clement lanes to church, and there to > meet Captain Cocke, who had often commended Mr. Alsopp, their minister, to > me, who is indeed an able man, but as all things else did not come up to my > expectations. His text was that all good and perfect gifts are from above. Among the mural tablets in the church are three which have been erected at the cost of the parishioners, commemorative of the Rev. Thomas Green, curate twenty-seven years, who died in 1734; the Rev. John Farrer, Rector, who died in 1820; and the Rev. W. Valentine Ireson, who was lecturer of the united parishes for thirty years and died in 1822. Memorial Memorial to Dositej Obradoviƒá near the church. Immediately next to the church in Clement's Lane is a memorial stone to Dositej Obradoviƒá (1742‚Äì1811), a Serbian statesman and man of letters who became Serbia's first Education Minister. He stayed in a house here in 1784. His name here is anglicised to Dositey Obradovich.

He was son of his predecessor Joscelin I of Edessa and Beatrice, daughter of Constantine I of Armenia. Biography In 1122, Joscelin I was captured by Belek Ghazi. The next year, he was joined in captivity by Baldwin II of Jerusalem. Joscelin I was rescued in 1123 by Armenian soldiers, and he worked with Baldwin's wife Morphia to secure the king's release. The young Joscelin II and Baldwin's daughter Joveta were ransomed for Baldwin's release in 1124. Joscelin II and Joveta were released in 1125 in exchange for 80,000 dinars, spoils from Baldwin's victory over al- Bursuqi at the battle of Azaz. In 1131, his father Joscelin I was wounded in battle with the Danishmends, and Edessa passed to Joscelin II. Joscelin II refused to march the small Edessan army out to meet the Danishmends, so Joscelin I, in his last act, forced the Danishmends to retreat, dying soon after. Joscelin II ruled the weakest and most isolated of the Crusader states. In 1138 he allied with Antioch and Byzantine emperor John II Komnenos to attack Zengi, atabeg of Aleppo, the campaign ended with the unsuccessful Siege of Shaizar of 1138. Upon returning to Antioch, Joscelin II exploited local sentiment against the Byzantine Empire to instigate a riot that forced John to return home. In 1143 both John II and Fulk of Jerusalem died, leaving Joscelin II with no powerful allies to help defend Edessa. In autumn 1144, Joscelin II formed an alliance with the Artuqid Kara Aslan and marched a sizable army north to assist in their struggle with Zengi. With the capital only lightly defended, Zengi redirected his army, invading and capturing the city after the Siege of Edessa in 1144. Joscelin II fled to Turbessel, where he held the remnants of the county west of the Euphrates. After Yarankash, a Frankish slave, assassinated Zengi in September 1146, Joscelin II recaptured Edessa in October 1146. Receiving no help from the other Crusader states, the city was again lost in November, as Joscelin's expedition was driven out by Zengi's son Nur ad-Din. The Second Crusade, called in response to the fall of Edessa, shifted its focus to Damascus. In 1150 while en route to Antioch to enlist help, Joscelin II was taken prisoner by Nur-ed-Din's Turkomans. Joscelin II was taken to the city of Aleppo where he was led before a hostile crowd and publicly blinded. He spent the remaining nine years of his life in captivity in a Muslim prison. He died in the dungeons of the Citadel of Aleppo in 1159. Family He married Beatrice of Saone, the widow of the wealthy Antiochene baron, William of Zardana. She gave birth to at least two daughters and a son surviving to adulthood: * Agnes of Courtenay married Amalric I of Jerusalem, later king of Jerusalem. After her divorce from Amalric, she held the lands and incomes of the County of Jaffa. Joscelin II's grandchildren Baldwin IV of Jerusalem and Sibylla of Jerusalem were in turn monarchs of Jerusalem, as was his great-grandson Baldwin V of Jerusalem. * Joscelin III of Edessa held the nominal title Count of Edessa, being in reality the lord of a small seigneurie near Acre. * Isabella of Courtenay, possibly married Thoros II, Prince of Armenia had two daughters.

It is in the Chiltern Hills near the border with Oxfordshire. It is about six miles WSW of High Wycombe. It lies in the civil parish of Hambleden. The village name of Fingest comes from the Anglo Saxon name Thinghurst, meaning 'wooded hill where assemblies are made'. In the 16th century the name is recorded as Thingest and then Fingest. Although the early name is the etymological root of both 'Tinghurst' and 'Fingest', the latter doesn't follow the former by any normal linguistic line. The ancient parish of Fingest included Cadmore End to the north of the village, which became a separate ecclesiastical parish in 1852. The manor of Fingest anciently belonged to St Albans Abbey. In 1163 it was given to the bishop of Lincoln. The ghost of Henry Burghersh, 14th-century Bishop of Lincoln, is reputed to haunt the area. After this time it was used as the country residence for the Lincoln diocese until 1547 when it was seized by the Crown. It was then given two years later to the Duke of Somerset who exchanged it with a property belonging to Wells Cathedral. The manor is now privately owned. The civil parish of Fingest, originally based on the ecclesiastical parish, was enlarged in 1934 by adding land from the parishes of West Wycombe, Great Marlow and Hambleden. As a result, Lane End became the largest settlement in the parish, and the parish was renamed Fingest and Lane End in 1937.Vision of Britain website In the 1980s the civil parish was abolished. The larger part became the parish of Lane End, and the village of Fingest was added to Hambleden parish. Scenes of the period drama The Monuments Men were shot in Fingest in May 2013. Church The parish church of St Bartholomew's dates from the early Norman period. It has an unusual tower, with a double vaulted roof. The church is a Grade I listed building.

The parish measures about north ‚Äì south, but east ‚Äì west it is nowhere more than about wide. It is bounded to the southeast by the River Thame, to the east by a stream that joins the Thame, and to the west by field boundaries. It has an area of . The A41 main road between Aylesbury and Waddesdon runs through the middle of the parish. Aylesbury Vale Parkway railway station is on the A41 road, just outside the parish's eastern boundary. In 2010 the Office for National Statistics estimated the parish population to be 47. The 2011 Census included its population in that of the civil parish of Waddesdon. Archaeology The course of the former Akeman Street Roman road passes northwest ‚Äì southeast through the parish. A \\"heavy scatter of Roman pottery\\" has been found in the parish on the course of the former road, indicating the site of a former Romano-British settlement. Excavations carried out between 2007 and 2016 uncovered evidence for a late prehistoric territorial boundary, a middle Iron Age settlement and the agricultural hinterland of the putative nucleated Roman settlement of Fleet Marston. The latter included a \\"remarkable collection\\" of organic finds, included four hen's eggs (one of which survived excavation intact), leather shoes, wooden tools and a basketry tray made of woven oak bands and willow rods, in addition to evidence of malting and brewing, other roadside trades and crafts, burials and a possible pyre site. Toponym The toponym \\"Marston\\" is derived from the Old English for \\"marsh farm\\". The prefix \\"Fleet\\" refers to the stream along eastern side of the parish, and was added to distinguish the village from nearby North Marston. The Domesday Book of 1086 records the village as Mersetone. In the 13th century the village name was recorded as Flettemerstone. Parish church Churches Conservation Trust plaque on St Mary's church porch The oldest parts of St Mary's parish church are 12th-century. There are records of parish rectors from 1223 onwards. The baptismal font may be 13th-century and the present chancel arch and north porch were added in the 14th century. One of the windows is 15th-century. Parish registers from 1630 onwards survive. John Wesley is known to have preached his first sermon at Fleet Marston shortly after his ordination as deacon in 1725. The building was restored in 1868‚Äì69 under the direction of George Gilbert Scott. It is now a Grade II* listed building. It is also a redundant church in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. Economic and social history Some buildings in the village, including Fleet Marston Farm, are 17th-century. The manor house referred to below stood near the church, and was demolished in 1772. In 1806 Daniel and Samuel Lysons described Fleet Marston in their Magna Britannia: > FLEET-MARSTON, in the hundred of Ashendon and deanery of Waddesdon, lies > about three miles from Aylesbury, on the road to Bicester. The manor, which > was for many years in the Lees, has been lately purchased of their > representative, Lord Dillon, by James Dupr√© esq. of Wilton Park. The > advowson of the rectory being then the property of John Tirrel-Morin esq. > was advertised for sale in the month of May 1805. By 1851 the parish was in decline. The religious census of 1851 recorded its population as 30, with just eight attending church on Sunday 30 March. By 1871 the population had fallen to 23, living in five houses. Little remains of the village today. In the south of the parish is the farm at Putlowes and Putlowes Cottages just to the southwest of the A41 road. In the centre of the parish, just northeast of the A41 are some smaller farms and St Mary's church. In the north of the parish are Fleet Marston Farm, Fleet Marston Cottages and Lower Fleetmarston Farm. The latter can be reached only via Berryfields Road in adjoining Quarrendon parish (another deserted village). =Railway= The Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway was built through the parish in the 1860s and opened in 1868. The Metropolitan Railway took it over in 1891 and opened Waddesdon railway station about northwest of Fleet Marston in 1897. The line became part of the Metropolitan and Great Central Joint Railway in 1906. Waddesdon station was closed in 1936. British Railways withdrew passenger services in 1963 and later reduced the line to single track. However, in 2011 Chiltern Railways opened Aylesbury Vale Parkway railway station where the line crosses the A41 road, just outside the eastern boundary of the parish.

The company went public in 1973. Ownership of Ranbaxy changed twice over the course of its history. In 2008, Japanese pharmaceutical company Daiichi Sankyo acquired a controlling share in Ranbaxy and in 2014, Sun Pharma acquired 100% of Ranbaxy in an all-stock deal. The Sun Pharma acquisition brought all new management to Ranbaxy, which had been laden with controversy (see Controversies below). Sun is the world's fifth largest specialty generic pharmaceutical company. History =Formation= Ranbaxy was started by Ranbir Singh and Gurbax Singh in 1937 as a distributor for Japanese company Shionogi. The name Ranbaxy is a portmanteau of the names of its founders: Ranbir and Gurbax. Bhai Mohan Singh bought the company in 1952 from his cousins Ranbir and Gurbax. After Bhai Mohan Singh's son Parvinder Singh joined the company in 1967, the company saw an increase in scale. In the late 1990s, Ranbaxy formed a US company, Ranbaxy Pharmaceuticals Inc., in order to support its entry into the pharmaceutical market in United States. =Trading= For the twelve months ending on 31 December 2005, the company's global sales were US$1,178 million, with overseas markets accounting for 75% of global sales (USA: 28%, Europe: 17%, Brazil, Russia, and China: 29%). In December 2005, Ranbaxy's share price was hit by a patent ruling disallowing production of its own version of Pfizer's cholesterol-cutting drug Lipitor, which has annual sales of more than $10 billion.Patent ruling hits Ranbaxy shares ‚Äì 19 December 2005. BBC News (19 December 2005). In June 2008, Ranbaxy settled the patent dispute with Pfizer, allowing them to sell Atorvastatin Calcium, the generic version of Lipitor and Atorvastatin Calcium-Amylodipine Besylate, the generic version of Pfizer's Caduet, in the US, starting on 30 November 2011. On 23 June 2006, the US Food & Drug Administration granted Ranbaxy a 180-day exclusivity period to sell simvastatin (Zocor) in the US as a generic drug at 80 mg strength. Ranbaxy competed with the maker of brand-name Zocor, Merck & Co.; IVAX Corporation (which was acquired by and merged into Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.), which has 180-day exclusivity at strengths other than 80 mg; and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, also from India, whose authorized generic version (licensed by Merck) is exempt from exclusivity. On 1 December 2011, Ranbaxy got approval from the FDA to launch the generic version of Lipitor in the United States after the drug's patent expired. = Acquisition by Daiichi Sankyo = In June 2008, Daiichi Sankyo acquired a 34.8% stake in Ranbaxy from the family of CEO and Managing Director Malvinder Mohan Singh for Rs. 10,000 crore (US$2.4 billion) at Rs. 737 per share.

The addition of Ranbaxy Laboratories extended Daiichi-Sankyo's operations, with the combined company worth about US$30 billion. In 2009, it was reported that former Novartis Senior Vice-President Yugal Sikri would lead the Indian operations of Ranbaxy Laboratories. In 2011, Ranbaxy Global Consumer Health Care received the OTC Company of the year award. In the 2012, 2013, and 2014 Brand Trust Reports, Ranbaxy was ranked 161st, 225th, and 184th respectively among India's most trusted brands. = Acquisition by Sun Pharmaceutical = On 7 April 2014, India-based Sun Pharmaceutical and Japan-based Daiichi Sankyo jointly announced the sale of the entire 63.4% share of Ranbaxy from Daiichi Sankyo to Sun Pharmaceutical in a $4 billion all-share deal. Under these agreements, shareholders of Ranbaxy were to receive a 0.8 share of Sun Pharmaceutical for each share of Ranbaxy. After this acquisition, the partner Daiichi-Sankyo was to hold a stake of 9% in Sun Pharmaceutical.  Controversies  During 2004‚Äì2005, Dinesh Thakur and Rajinder Kumar, two Indian employees of Ranbaxy, blew the whistle on Ranbaxy's fabrication of drug test reports. Thakur's office computer was soon found to have been compromised. Ranbaxy then accused Thakur of visiting pornographic sites using his office computer, forcing him to resign in 2005. Thakur left India for the United States and contacted the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which started investigating his claims. ‚Äî an in-depth investigation of Ranbaxy Laboratories As a result, on 16 September 2008, the Food and Drug Administration issued two warning letters to Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. and an Import Alert for generic drugs produced by two manufacturing plants in India. By 25 February 2009, the FDA said it had halted reviews of all drug applications, including data developed at Ranbaxy's Paonta Sahib plant in India, because of a practice of falsified data and test results in approved and pending drug applications. On 8 February 2012, three batches of the proton-pump inhibitor Pantoprazole were recalled in the Netherlands due to the presence of impurities. On 9 November 2012, Ranbaxy halted production and recalled 41 lots of atorvastatin due to glass particles being found in some bottles.Following Earlier Recall, Ranbaxy Halts Manufacturing Atorvastatin. Forbes. Also in 2012, an apparent dosage mistake was reported in which 20 mg tablets were found in a bottle of atorvastatin labeled as containing 10 mg tablets; this led in 2014 to the voluntary recall in the United States of some 64,000 bottles. In May 2013, Ranbaxy pleaded guilty to felony charges relating to the manufacture and distribution of certain adulterated drugs made at two of Ranbaxy's manufacturing facilities in India, and misrepresenting clinical generic drug data. Ranbaxy pleaded guilty to three felony FDCA counts, and four felony counts of knowingly making materially false statements to the FDA. Included in the adulterated products were antiretroviral (ARV) drugs destined for treatment of HIV/AIDS in Africa. In September 2013, further problems were reported, including apparent human hair in a tablet, oil spots on other tablets, toilet facilities without running water, and a failure to instruct employees to wash their hands after using the toilet.Ranbaxy import ban: US FDA found suspected hair, oil in tablets Ranbaxy was prohibited from manufacturing FDA-regulated drugs at the Mohali facility until it complied with United States drug manufacturing requirements. In 2014, The FDA notified Ranbaxy Laboratories, Ltd., that it was prohibited from manufacturing and distributing active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) from its facility in Toansa, India, for FDA-regulated drug products. The FDA's inspection of the Toansa facility, which concluded on January 11, 2014, identified significant CGMP violations. These included Toansa staff retesting raw materials, intermediate drug products, and finished API after those items failed analytical testing and specifications, in order to produce acceptable findings, and subsequently not reporting or investigating these failures. In 2019 author Katherine Eban published Bottle of Lies, an in-depth investigation of Ranbaxy. In addition to the incidents described above, Eban describes internal struggles within the FDA as investigators who might have shut down Ranbaxy were overruled due to pressure to increase the supply of cheap generic drugs.

Its current leader is Bouguerra Soltani. It is aligned with the international Muslim Brotherhood.  Roots in the Muslim Brotherhood  The Muslim Brotherhood reached Algeria during the later years of the French colonial presence in the country (1830‚Äì1962). Sheikh Ahmad Sahnoun led the organization in Algeria between 1953 and 1954 during the French colonialism. Brotherhood members and sympathizers took part in the uprising against France in 1954-1962, but the movement was marginalized during the FLN one-party rule which was installed at independence in 1962. Islamist forces however remained active in religious education, mosques and religious associations, including sympathizers of the Muslim Brotherhood. Brotherhood activists generally refrained from confronting the regime, which did not tolerate independent opposition, but sometimes protested the government and generally argued for a greater role for Islam in the country's politics. Islamists also called for increased Arabization of education and the state bureaucracy, and gained a foothold through heavy state backing for the early Arabization programs under Presidents Ahmed Ben Bella and Houari Boum√©di√®ne. The reformist-Islamist ideology of the Muslim Brotherhood, in particular, was strengthened through the recruitment of Arabic language teachers from other Arab countries, particularly Egypt, which is the Brotherhood's main stronghold.  History of the party  When a multi-party system was introduced in Algeria in the early 1990s, the Muslim Brotherhood formed the Movement for the Society of Peace (MSP), led by Mahfoud Nahnah until his death in 2003 (he was succeeded by present party leader Boudjerra Soltani). The party was initially known as the Movement for the Islamic Society, and abbreviated in Arabic as Hamas, but following legal bans on religiously founded parties, the name was changed. (The abbreviation Hamas still remains in use.) A dissident wing of Brotherhood-inspired Islamists led by Abdallah Djaballah formed their own party, El Nahda, which later split to create El Islah, advocating a more hardline stand towards the government. (Neither is supported by the Muslim Brotherhood's international organization, which recognizes MSP/Hamas as its Algerian wing.) The Muslim Brotherhood in Algeria did not join the Front islamique du salut (FIS), which emerged as the leading Islamist group in the 1990 local and 1991 parliamentary elections, although the rapidly growing FIS did attract some of its supporters. In 1992, a military coup d'√©tat cancelled elections which the FIS was on the verge of winning, and banned the organization. The Brotherhood condemned the coup, but refused to join the resulting violent uprising by FIS sympathizers and the Armed Islamic Groups (GIA) against the Algerian state and military. Instead, the group urged a peaceful resolution to the conflict and cooperation with the state, which for a time caused some strains with the international Muslim Brotherhood, where many sympathized with the Islamist insurgency. The MSP/Hamas thus remained a legal political organization, and ran in all elections organized by the state while the ex-FIS and other rebel forces urged a boycott. In retaliation for the party's pro-government stance, several members were assassinated by extremist militants during the war. Since 1997, the party has been supportive of the presidencies of Liamine Zeroual and Abdelaziz Bouteflika, and has participated in government. In parliament and government, the party has tried to strengthen conservative and Islamic trends in state and society, e.g. in opposing secularizing changes in the Algerian Family Code. It has argued in favor of amnesty and reconciliation efforts towards former Islamist guerrillas, while simultaneously condemning violence and supporting the state in its confrontation with radical groups still fighting, such as al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (formerly GSPC).  Electoral participation  In the first round of the 1991 parliamentary elections (Algeria's first multi-party elections) the MSP/Hamas gained 5,3% of the popular vote, becoming the fourth- largest party in parliament. The movement was significantly weaker than the non-Brotherhood FIS, which became the largest party with 47%. The second round of elections were cancelled by a military coup in January 1992, and the FIS was banned. =During the civil war = The MSP/Hamas protested the coup, but also clearly condemned the Islamist insurgency that ensued. The party remained committed to the political process, arguing in favor of peaceful reconciliation, an amnesty for Islamist fighters and a return to democracy, while criticizing both sides of the conflict. In 1995, Sheikh Nahnah participated in the presidential elections as main contender against the military-backed winning candidate, Liamine Zeroual. He finished second with 25.38% of the popular vote. In the 1997 parliamentary elections, the party gained 14.8% of the vote, finishing as the second-largest party in parliament., and subsequently joining the pro-Zeroual governing coalition under leadership of the RND. = Presidential alliance under Bouteflika = The party would later support Zeroual's successor as president from 1999, Abdelaziz Bouteflika. In the first parliamentary elections under Bouteflika, the MSP received 7% of the vote in the 2002 elections, gaining 38 members in the parliament. In the 2004 presidential elections, the party endorsed and were part of a coalition supporting the reelection of Bouteflika, and it has remained committed to the three-party \\"presidential coalition\\" (together with the secular FLN and the RND parties). As part of the presidential coalition, the party has argued for conservative values and the Islamization of society, as well as supported Bouteflika's projects to grant amnesty to former Islamist militants. In the 2007 parliamentary elections, the MSP again ran as a member of the presidential bloc, earning 9.64% of the popular vote and becoming the third-largest party of the parliament, with 52 members. The party further supported constitutional changes in 2008, designed to allow President Bouteflika to run for a third term. Rather than launching its own candidate, it campaigned in favor of Bouteflika's candidacy in the 2009 presidential election. = Green Algeria Alliance = In 2012 it however turned to founding the Islamist coalition Green Algeria Alliance, together with Islah and Nahda. Jointly participating in the 2012 legislative election, the three Islamist parties had to suffer losses achieving only 6.22% of the popular vote and 49 seats. On 25 January 2014, the MSP announced to boycott the 2014 presidential election. The party did not participate in the 2019 presidential election. A former member of the party, former Tourism Minister Abdelkader Bengrini, started his own party el-Bina, and received 1.5 million votes, or 17.4%, on a turnout of 40%.

It is located north of Arbroath, in Angus, Scotland, and remains occupied. History Colliston was part of the lands of Arbroath Abbey from its foundation in the 12th century. On 25 July 1544, David Beaton, Abbot of Arbroath and Archbishop of St Andrews, granted the lands of Colliston, Knives, Park of Conon, and Guthrie Hill, to John Guthrie and his wife Isobel Ogilvie. Colliston was retained by the Guthries until the late 17th century, when it passed to the Gordon family. By 1820 George Chaplin was in possession of Colliston, and was succeeded by his nephew George Robertson Chaplin of Auchengray, and then George Chaplin Child Chaplin, M.D. He died in 1883, and was succeeded by Mr Peebles of Somerset House, London. It was purchased in 1920 by Major R.F.D. Bruce, whose wife continued to live there after his death. It was sold several times during the 20th century, and most recently in 2011. The house is currently available for holiday rentals. It is a category B listed building. Description The original Z-plan part of the castle of Colliston bears the date 1583 (sometimes misread as 1553). It consists of a main block with two round towers projecting at opposite corners, and a stair turret rising in one of the re-entrant angles between the main block and tower. This tower, which also houses the entrance to the castle, is corbelled out at the top to form a gabled watch-chamber. The plan is similar to Claypotts Castle and is amply provided with wide splayed gun-loops and circular shot-holes for defence. The wall heads and the entire upper storey were remodelled several times and are not original. A later doorway is dated 1621, and the north and east wings were added in the 18th and 19th centuries.

The original game was written by Shane Lacy Hensley and published by Pinnacle Entertainment Group in 1996. The eight-times Origins Award-winning setting has been converted to many other systems over the years and is available in the original Classic Rules, the revised Classic Rules, d20 System, GURPS, as well as a Savage Worlds version called Deadlands: Reloaded. Development Shane Lacy Hensley had the idea for a new game centering on cowboys and zombies as he was setting up Pinnacle Entertainment Group, when he saw the Brom painting of a Confederate vampire on the cover of White Wolf's then-unreleased Necropolis: Atlanta; he thus began writing what would eventually become Deadlands. After completing a first draft, Hensley flew in two friends and game designers, Greg Gorden and Matt Forbeck; they both liked what they saw and asked to buy into Pinnacle. Setting The game is set in the United States in the last quarter of the 19th century. The canonical year for the first edition of Deadlands is 1876. A later supplement, Tales o' Terror, advances the game's backstory and metaplot ahead one year, to 1877. The second edition of Deadlands uses the updated backstory of 1877 as the canonical starting point. Deadlands: Reloaded further updates the backstory and advances the canonical starting point to 1879. The basic rules provide for characters and settings that could be expected to appear in the \\"Wild West\\" genre of movies and pulp fiction, and most of the in-game action is presumed to occur in the wild frontiers of the American West, or in barely tamed frontier towns like Tombstone, Arizona or Dodge City, Kansas. However, later supplements expanded the in-game adventuring area to include places such as the Deep South, the Mississippi River, Mexico, and the Northeastern United States. These supplements often provide for adventures set in urban areas such as New Orleans, New York City, or Boston. The canonical, basic setting is referred to as the \\"Weird West\\" due to the juxtaposition of the Western setting with the horrific and fantastical elements of the game. The history of the Weird West is identical to real-world history, up until July 3, 1863. On this date in the game, a group of American Indians from various tribes, led by a Sioux shaman known as \\"Raven,\\" performed a ritual in an effort to drive out the European settlers. This ritual created a conduit to a spiritual realm populated by powerful malicious entities known as the \\"Reckoners.\\" The events surrounding and immediately subsequent to Raven's ritual is known as \\"The Reckoning.\\" The Reckoners feed on negative emotions, particularly fear. Sufficient levels of fear in the population of a given location allow the Reckoners to begin subtly altering the environment of that location: the sun shines a little less brightly, trees become stunted and \\"evil\\" looking, rock formations take on the appearance of corpses or monsters, and so on. The more powerful the fear, the greater the environmental changes. The ultimate goal of the Reckoners is to turn the entire Earth into an evil, haunted wasteland ‚Äî literally a Hell on Earth. However, the Reckoners cannot directly enter Earth's realm unless the overall fear level of the entire planet becomes sufficiently high. To this end, they use their powers to create monsters, madmen, zombies, and other creatures and villains that will sow fear and terror throughout the land. The first instance of this occurred on July 4, 1863, at the site of the Battle of Gettysburg that had just ended; dead soldiers from both sides of the conflict rose from the battlefield and began indiscriminately attacking the surviving soldiers and civilians. Since then, undead gunslingers, hostile Indian spirits, strange cults, and deadly creatures have begun terrorizing the world. The American Civil War drags on thanks to the machinations of the Reckoners, and the country remains divided into U.S. and Confederate sections along with \\"disputed territories.\\" Federal agents and Texas Rangers struggle to deal with the eldritch menaces while hiding the awful truth from the general public. Seismic upheavals have pushed much of California into the ocean, creating a badlands area known as \\"the Great Maze.\\" In the Great Maze, miners discover \\"ghost rock,\\" a mineral that burns hotter and longer than coal and is used as the basis for most Deadlands technology as well as alchemical potions and semi-magical materials. The unleashing of the Reckoners has had a number of important side effects. Magic was revealed to be real, although it involves challenging otherworldly spirits, \\"manitous\\", in contests that are either viewed as a negotiation or a test of will. These same manitous can possess a recently deceased body and reanimate it, creating a \\"Harrowed\\". Harrowed beings are sometimes under the control of the spirit (which uses the opportunity to spread fear) and sometimes under the control of the deceased being. Scientific progress rapidly advances as the Reckoners support experimental designs that normally would not work. This progress drives the technological level of Deadlands from historical levels to a \\"steampunk\\" setting. Players take on the role of various mundane or arcane character types, including Gunfighters, Lawmen (such as U.S. Marshals or local sheriffs), Hucksters (magic users), Shamans, Blessed (those of faith), and Mad Scientists in an attempt to learn about the Reckoning and the mysterious beings behind it.  System  Deadlands features a unique way of creating playing characters for the game. Instead of spending character points, or randomly rolling dice, a character's abilities are determined by drawing cards from a standard 54-card poker deck (jokers included), which determine the character's Traits (their basic attributes). The game also uses polyhedral dice (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20) which are referred to as the \\"Bones\\", and a set of white, red, and blue poker chips called \\"Fate Chips\\".The Classic Deadlands mini-chips set used a 4:2:1 ratio of 40 white, 20 red and 10 blue chips. The Deadlands Reloaded (Savage Worlds) chips set use a ratio of 4:2:1:1 of 20 white, 10 red, 5 blue, and 5 gold (Legendary) chips. In a Deadlands game, the Game Master is called The Marshal, and the players are called The Posse. To perform an action a player rolls for successes with a handful of dice and hopes that at least one of the dice rolls the Target Number or higher. Rolling the highest possible number on any of the dice is known as \\"rolling an ace\\", and that die may be re-rolled, with the total being added to the initial roll value. In most cases only the highest single die's value (with \\"aces\\" added) is compared to a target number. For each five points over the target number the character is considered to have a \\"raise\\" which typically makes the character's action more effective. When attacking someone, raises give the attacker more control over where on the victim's body the blow or bullet strikes. When attempting to quickly reload a gun, each raise allows another round of ammunition to be loaded in a single action.Deadlands: The Weird West Roleplaying Game, Pinnacle Entertainment Group, August 1996, 224 p. soft cov., =Spell Casting= Players with huckster characters use a deck of playing cards in addition to dice to cast their spells (hexes). A successful skill check allows the player to draw five or more cards and makes the best possible poker hand with those cards. The strength of the hand determines not only whether the hex was successfully cast, but also the strength of its effects. In the game world, this mechanic is explained as the huckster literally gambling with a magical spirit in order to get it to do his or her bidding ‚Äî a high ranking poker hand means the huckster has won, and the spirit casts the hex as desired; a low ranking poker hand results in failure. Both jokers are present and wild, increasing the chance of a good hand, but the black joker means that the spirit does something harmful to the huckster. Blessed characters can use their faith to invoke miracles‚Äîthey pray for their patron to grant their request. The miracles are usually protective or restorative in nature, although there are some for attack. The difficulty of a given miracle (the amount of faith required by the patron for their assistance) can vary. For example, a priest seeking to heal a gunshot to the stomach would require more faith than if he were trying to mend a broken arm. Although the basic miracle set is predominantly Christian in nature, one of the extension sourcebooks includes miracles from other religions, and some of those are not permitted to Christian player characters. Native American shamans cast spells by making deals with spirits. This happens in three stages: the shaman asks for a favor, performs the ritual that tradition demands for that favor, and then his skill is tested by the spirit. If he succeeds all three, he earns \\"appeasement points\\" according to how well he succeeded. If he earned enough points for the favor, it is granted. If not, his work was in vain. =Action Decks= Instead of rolling for Initiative as in most other RPGs, the players make a \\"speed\\" roll on the bones ‚Äî the exact number and type being rolled determined by each character's stats ‚Äî and then draw a number of cards from a community playing card deck based on the results of that roll. The Marshal then calls out card values, starting from Aces and going all the way down to Deuces. The card's suit (Spades, Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, which is reverse alphabetical order and also the valuation in bridge) indicates who goes first if the same value of card is drawn. =Fate Chips= Along with Bones and Cards, characters get Fate Chips which are typically poker chips, although colored stones or coins can also be used. These are drawn from a hat or some other container that the player blindly chooses at the beginning of play. Each player draws a certain number of Fate Chips at the beginning of the game from the Fate Pot, modified according to player actions and Marshal preference. Fate chips can be spent for in-game bonuses such as bonus dice to use during certain rolls, or the prevention of physical damage. The Marshal can draw chips as well for enemies to use. =Bounties= At the end of a gaming session, players can cash in unused Fate Chips for Bounty Points. These are like Experience Points in other systems and are used to improve Traits and Aptitudes. The Marshal may also award additional Bounty Points at the end of the session for completing the mission objectives and any exceptional role-playing by players. = Instant rewards for roleplaying = Marshals are also encouraged to reward players with instantaneous rewards for good role-playing. During character creation players can choose \\"Hindrances\\" (disadvantages) such as Big Britches, Bloodthirsty, or Big Mouth. When a player role-plays this Hindrance well, the Marshal can reward them instantly with a Fate Chip. This has the effect of promoting and encouraging role- playing. Spinoff games The \\"Weird West\\" mark is used to distinguish the primary game setting from the various other settings: *Deadlands: The Great Rail Wars ‚Äî a tabletop wargame with miniature figures. *Doomtown ‚Äî a collectible card game. A sourcebook for the town described in the game was released under the title Doomtown or Bust!. A secondary sourcebook, detailing the town after the events of the CCG, was released under the title The Black Circle. A third sourcebook titled The Collegium, detailing the Mad Scientist faction of the same name, was also released. *Range Wars ‚Äî a tabletop wargame that used collectible cardboard disks instead of miniatures. As much a spin- off from Doomtown as Deadlands, it used many of the same factions. It is based on the Disk Wars game. The base set: Doomtown: Range Wars was released, and a single expansion, Ghost Creek. Material from this game was incorporated into the Black Circle sourcebook. *Deadlands: Hell on Earth ‚Äî a role-playing game set in one possible future of the Weird West, where the Reckoners succeeded in turning the entire Earth into a haunted wasteland. This game features elements from the Western genre as well as elements from Mad Max-esque post-apocalyptic fiction and, of course, horror. *Deadlands: Lost Colony ‚Äî a role-playing game set in the same future as Deadlands: Hell on Earth, except on another planet. This game features sci-fi, Western, and horror elements. *Deadlands: Lost Colony CCG - A collectible card game with the same setting as the Lost Colony RPG. *Savage Worlds ‚Äî a miniatures and generic role-playing game system derived from The Great Rail Wars. *Deadlands: The Battle For Slaughter Gulch - A board game from Twilight creations. *FRAG Deadlands ‚Äî A first-person shooter themed board game in the Frag series from Steve Jackson Games. *Deadlands ‚Äî a cancelled video game developed by Headfirst Productions for the PC. *Deadlands Noir ‚Äî Set in the same world, but in a Dieselpunk 1930s New Orleans. Doomtown:Reloaded ‚Äî The classic CCG is back in a non-collectible boxed set. Released at GenCon in August 2014 by Alderac Entertainment Group, the game (in September 2014) was already in its THIRD printing. Doomtown: Reloaded is basically the same game as the older version, (now referred to as Classic) with a number of rule revisions that have streamlined and simplified the game. The basics are the same, with minor differences. The four factions released initially were the Law Dogs, The Sloan Gang (similar to the Blackjacks), The Fourth Ring (a circus that is similar to The Whatleys) and the Morgan Cattle Company (which appears to be similar to a Sweetrock\\\\Collegium blend).. Deadlands: Reloaded In May 2006, Great White Games published a new edition of Deadlands under the company's Pinnacle Entertainment Group label. This new edition, written by Shane Lacy Hensley and B.D. Flory and entitled Deadlands: Reloaded, used Great White Games' Savage Worlds generic role-playing system. The 256-page setting book updates the canonical setting to 1879 and includes information on the events of the past year, as well as new rules. Among the most drastic changes to the basic Savage Worlds rules was \\"The Way of the Brave\\" rule, which revamped the way combat works in the system, making it more dangerous and deadly for characters and increasing the effectiveness of melee combat. This book also updated Fate Chips to work with the Savage Worlds system. This book marked a first for Great White Games in that it is the first setting book published without a scripted or plot point campaign. The publisher has hinted that four complete plot point campaign books will be released for Deadlands: Reloaded, each focusing on certain regions and events in the metaplot of the game. In 2009 the first of these campaigns, The Flood, was released. In 2012, the second of these campaigns, The Last Sons, was released. Matthew Cutter of Pinnacle has also stated that updated Hell on Earth and Lost Colony books will be published for the Savage Worlds system. The Hell on Earth update was released in 2012. Additionally, an equipment guide \\"The Smith & Robards Catalog\\", was published in 2011. A successfully funded Kickstarter for a new spin-off setting, Deadlands Noir, was conducted from May to June 2012, with the product's release expected in 2013. Reaper miniatures has, as of August 2012, solicited two white-metal miniatures for the Deadlands Noire setting to distributors: \\"Stone\\" and \\"Femme Fatal\\" Release history * 1996 - Original Deadlands custom rules.HENSLEY Shane Lacy, Deadlands: The Weird West Roleplaying Game, Pinnacle Entertainment Group, August 1996, 224 p. soft cov., Exists also in hardcover and leatherbound collector editions.

Reception In the December 1996 edition of Dragon (Issue 236), Rick Swan liked the energy of the Western/horror mash-up, calling it \\"a revolutionary mix of fantasy and cyberpunk.\\" However, Swan criticized the lack of setting details: \\"What we‚Äôre given is little more than an overview... there are no interesting personalities to speak of. There‚Äôs next to nothing about geography, politics, or culture. Cities, villages, places to explore ‚Äî practically none. And there‚Äôs not a single ready-to-play adventure.\\" He concluded by giving the game an average rating of 4 out of 6, saying, \\"Deadlands is by no means bad. It‚Äôs beautifully written and bursting with nifty ideas. It strikes a masterful balance between high camp and high adventure. It has a great cover. But it‚Äôs incomplete; with a setting this skeletal and the absence of adventures, how‚Äôs a newcomer supposed to cobble together a campaign?\\" Awards Deadlands, its supplements and spin-offs have won nine Origins Awards: * Best Role-playing Rules of 1996 for Deadlands * Best Graphic Presentation of a Role-playing Game, Adventure, or Supplement of 1996 for Deadlands * Best Science Fiction or Fantasy Miniatures Rules of 1997 for Deadlands: the Great Rail Wars * Best Roleplaying Adventure of 1997 for Independence Day * Best Trading Card Game of 1998 * Best Graphic Presentation of a Card Game of 1998 * Best Science Fiction or Fantasy Figure Miniature of 1998 for Hangin' Judge * Best Vehicle Miniature of 1998 for Velocipede * Roleplaying Game Supplement of 2007 for Deadlands: Reloaded Reviews *Valkyrie #14 (1997) *Shadis #30 (1996) *Pyramid #23 (Jan./Feb., 1997) *Arcane #13 (December 1996) Television series In 2014, Microsoft announced that it was developing an original television series for the Xbox based on Deadlands.

She also was the first holder of the title Princess Royal. The eldest daughter of King Charles I of England and Queen Henrietta Maria, Mary was married to the future stadtholder of the Netherlands, William II of Orange, as a 9-years-old girl in 1641. Initially, she remained in England with her parents because of the heated political situation in England until early 1642, when she and her mother left for the Netherlands. Five years later in 1647, Mary's husband inherited the titles of Prince of Orange and Stadtholder of Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht, Guelders, Overijssel and Groningen in the United Provinces of the Netherlands. Two days before her husband's death in 1650, Mary gave birth to a son, William, who later became King William III of England, Scotland and Ireland alongside his first cousin and wife, Queen Mary II. Mary, who became the only guardian of her son, was not popular in the Netherlands because of her support of her brothers and her difficult relationship with her mother-in-law Amalia of Solms-Braunfels, who considered the princess young and inexperienced. After the restoration of the monarchy in England in 1660, Mary departed for celebrations in London, where she fell ill with smallpox and died. Early years Mary as 6-years-old, by Anthony van Dyck, 1637 Princess Mary Henrietta was born on 4 November 1631 at St. James's Palace, London as the third (but second surviving) child and eldest daughter of Charles I, King of England, Scotland and Ireland and Henrietta Maria of France. She was baptized on the same day of her birth, as there were fears that the newborn princess was not in good health and might die; the ceremony was presided over by William Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury. The girl received her first name in honor of her maternal grandmother, Marie de' Medici, Queen of France. Mary's first public appearance took place in 1640 at the baptism of her brother Henry, Duke of Gloucester; she became the only godmother of the little prince. Mary spent the first years of her life with her brothers and sisters at St James's Palace, as well as at Richmond Palace and Hampton Court. The education of the princesseswas entrusted to the Countess of Roxburghe. Mary was known for her grace, beauty, and manners; in addition, she excelled in dancing, but her knowledge of the sciences left much to be desired. The girl's mother, Queen Henrietta Maria, wanted to convert her daughter to Catholicism, for which she introduced a young lady who secretly professed Catholicism to Mary's circle of friends, but King Charles I quickly stopped his wife's actions. In January 1640, 8-years-old Mary received her first marriage proposal: the 13-years-old William, the eldest son and heir of Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange, asked the hand of the princess. The mother of the potential groom, Amalia of Solms- Braunfels, was once a lady-in-waiting and close friend of Mary's aunt Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia, which later played an important role in Mary's life. The offer of the House of Orange was at first rejected by King Charles I, who wanted to give his daughter in marriage to Balthasar Charles, Prince of Asturias, only son and heir of King Philip IV of Spain and also Mary's maternal first-cousin. A pre-requisite for such a union was Mary's conversion to Catholicism, but the princess, who at the request of her mother studied the basics of the Catholic religion, didn't want to change her faith. Charles I Louis, Elector Palatine, Mary's paternal first-cousin, was also a suitor for her hand, but at the end this proposal also fell through. =Marriage and Princess consort of Orange= By the end of the 1630s, relations between the various factions in English society had become very tense; controversies over religion, social relations, morality, and political power became more and more heated. At the same time, Mary's mother, who openly professed Catholicism, became more and more unpopular in the country. In late 1640‚Äìearly 1641, King Charles I decided on renew negotiations with Prince Frederick Henry of Orange. Betrothed William and Mary by Anthony van Dyck, 1641 The negotiations progressed quickly and already on 10 February 1641 King Charles I announced to the Parliament that the agreement on the marriage of his daughter was actually concluded and that it only remained to consider this union from a political point of view. The English sovereign himself hoped that in case of emergency, the Prince of Orange would help him to maintain royal power in England. A modest wedding ceremony took place on 2 May 1641 at the Chapel Royal in Whitehall Palace, London. Queen Henrietta Maria was unable to attend the religious ceremony as it was a Protestant one; instead, she watched her daughter's wedding from a small gallery. The marriage of the King's eldest daughter was practically not celebrated in England, as the country was on the verge of a war that broke out in less than a year. Mary and William received congratulations from the courtiers, as well as several gifts; in addition, in honor of the newlyweds, a volley of 120 guns was fired, after which William returned to the Netherlands. According to the marriage contract, Mary could remain in England until she was 12-years-old; her husband had to provide her with 1,500 livres per year for personal expenses, in addition, in the event of the untimely death of William, Mary received a maintenance of 10,000 livres per year and two residences for her personal use. The marriage contract also contained a clause according to which Mary and her courtiers were allowed to freely practice their religion, which was somewhat different from the religion in the country of her husband. In early 1642, the situation in the country heated up. Mary and her parents were forced to take refuge in Hampton Court, but the situation steadily turned into open war, and in February Queen Henrietta Maria departed with her daughter to The Hague; in order to ferry the princess and her mother to the Netherlands in England, a Dutch escort of fifteen ships arrived. With Mary in the Netherlands went to her governess, Lady Stanhope, which later became a confidant and companion of the princess. From a political point of view, the marriage of Mary partially paid off in 1643, when Queen Henrietta Maria was able to convince the Dutch government to provide her husband a ship arms and cross over with them in Yorkshire. Mary, Princess Royal, and William II, Prince of Orange by Gerard van Honthorst, 1647 Shortly before leaving for the Netherlands, Mary was designated by her father Princess Royal, thus establishing the tradition that the eldest daughter of the British sovereign might bear this title. The title came into being when Queen Henrietta Maria, the daughter of King Henry IV of France wished to imitate the way the eldest daughter of the French king was styled (Madame Royale). Until that time, the eldest daughters of English and Scottish kings were variously titled lady or princess (The younger daughters of British sovereigns were not consistently titled princesses of Great Britain and styled Royal Highness until the accession of George I in 1714). In November 1643, the second marriage ceremony between Mary and William took place in The Hague. Despite the fact that Mary was already 12-years-old, her marriage wasn't consummated until 1644. In February 1644, Mary completely merged into the life of the Dutch court. She gave audiences, met with foreign ambassadors and performed all the functions assigned to her with an importance and dignity astonishing for her age. In March, she participated in a number of court celebrations on the occasion of the recent alliance between France and the Netherlands and led by entertainment that her husband arranged for the French ambassador. Mary, who constantly receiving news from England, sympathized with her father's cause and in December 1646 with a Dutch merchant ship she sent King Charles I a letter in which she urged him to take the opportunity and flee to the Netherlands, but the English sovereign didn't listen to his daughter. In the Netherlands, Mary developed a very warm relationship with her aunt, Elizabeth, the former Queen of Bohemia, who was in exile in The Hague. However, Maria didn't develop a good relationship with her mother-in-law Amalia, so she tried to minimize contact with her. Prince Frederick Henry of Orange died on 14 March 1647. On the day of his death, Parliament was convened, which proclaimed William II to be his father's heir as stadtholder and head of the army; one by one, the remaining titles of her late father-in- law were recognized for Mary's husband, and he became in the new Prince of Orange. In 1648, Mary was visited by the brothers Charles, Prince of Wales and James, Duke of York. In 1649, Mary's father was executed; after the death of Charles I, the princess helped many noble Englishmen and supporters of her father who were forced to flee the country. Among those who were under her patronage of the princess was the family of Anne Hyde ‚Äì the future wife of the Duke of York and mother of two English Queens, Mary II and Anne. =Widowhood and co-regency= In the Autumn of 1647 Mary suffered a miscarriage, after which she couldn't conceive for several years. In early 1650, she was pregnant again. In late October-early November, when the princess's pregnancy was coming to an end, her husband fell ill with smallpox and died on 6 November, just after his attempt to capture Amsterdam from his political opponents; two days before his death, on the day of her nineteenth birthday, Mary gave birth to a son, William. The newborn prince's cradle was draped with black cloth as a sign of sorrow for his father. Since the titles of the stadtholder of the Netherlands and the Prince of Orange were not inheritable, little William didn't receive them immediately after birth. Soon after the birth of her son, Mary had several conflicts with her mother-in-law. She planned to name her son Charles in honor of her executed father, but Amalia insisted that the boy be named William, which was a better choice: the first ruler of the United Provinces of the Netherlands was William I of Orange and in addition, the boy's late father also wanted to name his son William. Having won the battle for the name of her grandson, Amalia now wanted to become her legal guardian, referring to the fact that Mary is too young. On 13 August 1651, the Hoge Raad van Holland en Zeeland (Supreme Court) ruled that guardianship would be shared between Mary, her mother-in-law and Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg (whose wife, Louise Henriette was William II's eldest sister); the Elector was chosen because he could act as a neutral party mediating between the two women, but also because as a possible heir he was interested in protecting the Orange family fortune, which Amalia feared Mary would squander. William III, Prince of Orange aged 4, by Adriaen Hanneman, 1654. In general, Mary was not popular in the Netherlands, which were more sympathetic to Oliver Cromwell; the princess herself, because of such preferences of the Dutch, refused to hire them to serve her son. In January 1650, Mary, along with her brother James and aunt Elizabeth, planned to modestly celebrate the first anniversary of her father's death, but the Dutch government considered even modest events offensive to the English government. A little later, when envoys from the English parliament were received by the States General, Mary retired to her widow's seat in Breda, but the influence of her party didn't allow the British to conclude an alliance with the Netherlands. After Mary secretly received her brother Charles II in 1651 (who considered himself the legitimate King of England), the Dutch government forbade her to accept any of her relatives. The household of Mary and her aunt was called a \\"nest of vipers\\", weaving conspiracies against the Netherlands, England and Cromwell in particular. In 1652, the mood in the Netherlands changed due to the outbreak of war with England. Mary's son was officially elected as the stadtholder of Zealand and several northern provinces, but Witte de With, the leader of the republic, prevented from William III being elected in Holland; in addition, when concluding a peace treaty, Cromwell insisted on the adoption of the Act of Seclusion, which prohibited Holland from appointing members of the Orange dynasty to the post of stadtholder. Another requirement of Cromwell was the expulsion of all enemies of the Commonwealth from Holland. Mary made an official protest, but it was not taken into account, despite the fact that the country was threatened by civil war; the peace treaty was signed on 27 May 1654. Mary's worries about the position of her son affected her health. To cut her own expenses in the interests of her brothers, she announced her intention to abandon two of the four palaces at her disposal. In July 1654, she went to a water resort, where she spent a few weeks, and then came to visit her brother Charles in Cologne, where his court was located. She returned to the Netherlands in October, but in July 1655 she again went to Charles in Cologne, visited the fair in Frankfurt incognito and returned home on 15 November. In January 1656, Mary went to Paris, where her mother and younger sister Henrietta lived, and was received with all honors at the French court. =Later years and death= In the Netherlands, the early widowed Mary was visited by numerous admirers and suitors, among whom was George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham. According to contemporaries, Duke Charles Emmanuel II of Savoy, Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick-L√ºneburg and his brother George William also offered their hands and hearts to Mary in Paris; in addition, Cardinal Mazarin showed particular favor to the princess, and also circulated rumours that she was having an affair with (or had been secretly married to) Henry Jermyn, a member of her brother James of York' household. The rumours were probably untrue, but Charles II took them seriously, and tried to prevent any further contact between Jermyn and the princess. Mary left Paris on 21 November and after a two-month stay at her brother's court in Bruges returned to The Hague. Soon after her return, Mary learned that her mother-in-law had offered Charles II to marry her daughter Henriette Catherine, which deeply angered the princess. In 1658, Amalia of Solms-Braunfels tried to obtain the post of sole regent for her grandson, to whom Mary was also appointed by the Supreme Court, but the princess, with the support of her French relatives, managed to repel the intrigues of her mother-in-law. In November 1659, Mary sent her son to study at Leiden University. On 14 May 1660, the Dutch parliament informed Mary, who was in Breda, about the restoration of the monarchy in England and the accession to the throne of her brother Charles (henceforth King Charles II). A few days later she took part in the celebrations at The Hague on this occasion. Mary's henceforth occupied now the fifth place in the line of succession to the English throne, and therefore the attitude towards the princess herself in the Netherlands became much more tolerant: in all the cities where Mary and William III were passing through or attended solemn events, they were greeted with royal honors. After the Stuart Restoration it was proclaimed that the Act of Seclusion was void, since no longer exists the English Republic, and in 1660, Mary, united with her mother in law, tried to convince the states of several provinces acknowledge William III as future Stadtholder, but many refused at first. On 30 September 1660, Mary sailed to England, where ‚Äîknowing about her concern for her exiled compatriots and brothers‚Äî was warmly received. Upon arrival in London, Mary discovered to her surprise and dismay that her brother the King not only recognized the marriage of James, Duke of York, with Anne Hyde, Mary's former lady-in-waiting, but also declared that their offspring would be princes and princesses of England with full succession rights. This fact upset Mary so much that she decided to significantly shorten her visit to her homeland. She attended the official service at Whitehall Chapel, where everyone who wanted to see her flocked, and also gave a private reception at Whitehall for Elias Ashmole to see some anatomical curiosities. She accepted a monetary gift from Parliament, received in a letter dated 7 November, and asked for a long- promised dowry; to resolve this issue, the King appointed a commission. In November 1660 Maria met with the Embassy of the United Provinces, who came to renew an alliance with England. On 20 December the English court was stirred up by the news that Mary was seriously ill with smallpox. Having received this news, Queen Henrietta Maria arrived at the bedside of her dying daughter and made a last attempt to convert her to Catholicism, but Mary refused. The Queen managed to insist that her French doctor take over the treatment of the princess, which, as many contemporaries believed, was fatal for Mary, since the doctor was an ardent supporter of bloodletting. On 24 December, Mary signed her will and died on the same day. At her own request, she was buried in Westminster Abbey next to her brother Henry, Duke of Gloucester, who also died of smallpox in September 1660. In her will, Mary asked the King to take care of the interests of her 10-year-old son, whose sole guardian was now his grandmother Amalia. On 4 July 1672, 21-year-old William III, after several years of confrontation with the government of the Netherlands, was nevertheless proclaimed stadtholder and commander-in-chief. Five years later, he married his cousin Mary, the daughter of James II and Anna Hyde. In 1688, with the support of English Protestants William III deposed Mary's father and with her was proclaimed co-ruler of England, Scotland and Ireland.

In the work of early 19th century political theorists such as Alexis de Tocqueville, the term was used in discussions of helpful concerns about a shift in the body politic of the Western world pronounced since the French Revolution. Such elite concerns centered in large part on the \\"tyranny of the majority\\", or mob rule. In the late 19th century, in the work of √âmile Durkheim, the term was associated with society as a mass of undifferentiated, atomistic individuals. In 20th century neo-Marxist accounts, such as those of the Frankfurt School, mass society was linked to a society of alienated individuals held together by a culture industry that served the interests of capitalism. Conservative accounts in the 20th century critiqued mass society from a different perspective. Jos√© Ortega y Gasset, for instance, lamented the decline of high culture in mass society.  Concept  Mass society as an ideology can be seen as dominated by a small number of interconnected elites who control the conditions of life of the many, often by means of persuasion and manipulation.McQuail, 2005, p. 449. This indicates the politics of mass society theorists- they are advocates of various kinds of cultural elite who should be privileged and promoted over the masses, claiming for themselves both exemption from and leadership of the misguided masses.Hartley, 1982 \\"As technological innovation allowed government to expand, the centralized state grew in size and importance.\\" \\"Since then, government has assumed responsibility for more and more areas of social life: schooling, regulating wages and working conditions, establishing standards for products of all sorts, and providing financial assistance to the elderly, the ill, and the unemployed.\\" \\"In a mass society, power resides in large bureaucracies, leaving people in local communities with little control over their lives. For example, state officials mandate that local schools must meet educational standards, local products must be government-certified, and every citizen must maintain extensive tax records. Although such regulations may protect and enhance social equality, they also force us to deal more and more with nameless officials in distant and often unresponsive bureaucracies, and they undermine the autonomy of families and local communities.\\"(Macionis, J. p. 498) Mass society theory has been active in a wide range of media studies, where it tends to produce ideal visions of what the mass media such as television and cinema are doing to the masses. Therefore, the mass media are necessary instruments for achieving and maintaining mass societies. \\"The mass media give rise to national culture that washes over the traditional differences that used to set off one region from another.\\" \\"Mass-society theorists fear that the transformation of people of various backgrounds into a generic mass may end up dehumanizing everyone.\\"(Macionis, J. p. 498) Sociologist C. Wright Mills made a distinction between a society of \\"masses\\" and \\"public\\". As he tells: \\"In a public, as we may understand the term, # virtually as many people express opinions as receive them, # Public communications are so organized that there is a chance immediately and effectively to answer back any opinion expressed in public. # Opinion formed by such discussion readily finds an outlet in effective action, even against ‚Äì if necessary ‚Äì the prevailing system of authority. # And authoritative institutions do not penetrate the public, which is thus more or less autonomous in its operations. In a mass, # far fewer people express opinions than receive them; for the community of public becomes an abstract collection of individuals who receive impressions from the mass media. # The communications that prevail are so organized that it is difficult or impossible for the individual to answer back immediately or with any effect. # The realization of opinion in action is controlled by authorities who organize and control the channels of such action. # The mass has no autonomy from institutions; on the contrary, agents of authorized institutions penetrate this mass, reducing any autonomy it may have in the formation of opinion by discussion\\".C.

It holds that the six days referred to in the Genesis account of creation are not ordinary 24-hour days, but are much longer periods (from thousands to billions of years). The Genesis account is then reconciled with the age of the Earth. Proponents of the day-age theory can be found among both theistic evolutionists, who accept the scientific consensus on evolution, and progressive creationists, who reject it. The theories are said to be built on the understanding that the Hebrew word yom is also used to refer to a time period, with a beginning and an end and not necessarily that of a 24-hour day. The differences between the young Earth interpretation of Genesis and modern scientific theories such as Big Bang, abiogenesis, and common descent are significant. The young Earth interpretation says that everything in the universe and on Earth was created in six 24-hour days, estimated to have occurred some 6,000 years ago. Modern scientific observations, however, put the age of the universe at 13.8 billion years and the Earth at 4.5 billion years, with various forms of life, including humans, being formed gradually over time. The day-age theory attempts to reconcile these views by asserting that the creation \\"days\\" were not ordinary 24-hour days, but actually lasted for long periods of time (as day-age implies, the \\"days\\" each lasted an age). According to this view, the sequence and duration of the creation \\"days\\" may be paralleled to the scientific consensus for the age of the earth and the universe. History A kind of figurative view can be traced back at least to Saint Augustine in the 5th Century who pointed out, in De Genesi ad Litteram (On the Literal [Interpretation of] Genesis) that the \\"days\\" in Genesis could not be literal days, if only because Genesis itself tells us that the sun was not made until the fourth \\"day\\".Pennock(2000), p 19 Scottish lawyer and geologist Charles Lyell published his famous and influential work Principles of Geology in 1830‚Äì1833 which interpreted geologic change as the steady accumulation of minute changes over enormously long spans of time and that natural processes, uniformly applied over the length of that existence (uniformitarianism), could account for what men saw and studied in creation. In the mid 19th century, American geologist Arnold Guyot sought to harmonize science and scripture by interpreting the \\"days\\" of Genesis 1 as epochs in cosmic history. Similar views were held by a prot√©g√© of Lyell, John William Dawson, who was a prominent Canadian geologist and commentator, from an orthodox perspective, on science and religion in the latter part of the 19th century. Dawson was a special creationist, but not a biblical literalist, admitting that the days of creation represented long periods of time, that the Genesis flood was only 'universal' from the narrator's limited perspective, and that it was only humanity, not the Earth itself, that was of recent creation.Numbers(2006), p21-23 American geologist and seminarian George Frederick Wright was originally a leading Christian Darwinist. However reaction against higher criticism in biblical scholarship and the influence of James Dwight Dana led him to become increasingly theologically conservative. By the first decade of the 20th century he joined forces with the emerging fundamentalist movement in advocating against evolution, penning an essay for The Fundamentals entitled \\"The Passing of Evolution\\". In these later years Wright believed that the \\"days\\" of Genesis represented geological ages and argued for the special creation of several plant and animal species \\"and at the same time endowed them with the marvellous capacity for variation which we know they possess.\\" His statements on whether there had been a separate special creation of humanity were contradictory.Numbers(2006), p33-50, 82 Probably the most famous day-age creationist was American politician, anti-evolution campaigner and Scopes Trial prosecutor William Jennings Bryan. Unlike many of his conservative followers, Bryan was not a strict biblical literalist, and had no objection to \\"evolution before man but for the fact that a concession as to the truth of evolution up to man furnishes our opponents with an argument which they are quick to use, namely, if evolution accounts for all the species up to man, does it not raise a presumption in behalf of evolution to include man?\\" He considered defining the days in Genesis 1 to be twenty-four hours to be a pro-evolution straw man argument to make attacking creationists easier, and admitted at Scopes that the world was far older than six thousand years, and that the days of creation were probably longer than twenty-four hours each.Numbers(2006) p58 American Baptist preacher and anti-evolution campaigner William Bell Riley, \\"The Grand Old Man of Fundamentalism\\", founder of the World Christian Fundamentals Association and of the Anti-Evolution League of America was another prominent day-age creationist in the first half of the 20th century, who defended this position in a famous debate with friend and prominent young Earth creationist Harry Rimmer.Numbers(2006) p82 One modern defender is astronomer Hugh Ross, who in 1994 wrote Creation and Time defending the day-age view in great detail,Pennock(2000), p20 and who founded the day-age creationist ministry Reasons to Believe.About Our Founder, Reasons to Believe Another person who has defended the view is Rodney Whitefield.http://godandscience.org/youngearth/genesis_one_age_earth.htmlhttp://www.creationingenesis.com/index.html Interpretation of Genesis Day-Age creationists differ from young Earth creationists in how they interpret a number of crucial Hebrew words in Genesis, and thus how they interpret the geneologies and creation account contained in it. They point out that the Hebrew words for father ('ab) and son (ben) can also mean forefather and descendent, respectively, and that the Biblical scripture occasionally \\"telescopes\\" geneologies to emphasise the more important ancestors. This, they argue, renders genealogically-based dating of the Creation, such as the Ussher chronology, to be inaccurate. They admit that yom can mean a twenty-four hour solar day, but argue that it can refer to an indefinitely long period of time. It is in this sense that the word is employed in Genesis 2:4, with a \\"day\\" of God's total creation taking place in the course of \\"days\\" of creation. Day-age creationists often point to phenomena such as the Cambrian explosion as evidence of one of the Creation \\"days\\" appearing in the fossil record as a long period of time.

The availability heuristic operates on the notion that if something can be recalled, it must be important, or at least more important than alternative solutions which are not as readily recalled. Subsequently, under the availability heuristic, people tend to heavily weigh their judgments toward more recent information, making new opinions biased toward that latest news.Phung, Albert. \\"Behavioral Finance: Key Concept- Overreaction and Availability Bias\\". Investopedia. February 25, 2009. p.10. December 1, 2013. The availability of consequences associated with an action is positively related to perceptions of the magnitude of the consequences of that action. In other words, the easier it is to recall the consequences of something, the greater those consequences are often perceived to be. Most notably, people often rely on the content of their recall if its implications are not called into question by the difficulty that they experience in bringing the relevant material to mind. Overview and history In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman began work on a series of papers examining \\"heuristic and biases\\" used in the judgment under uncertainty. Prior to that, the predominant view in the field of human judgment was that humans are rational actors. Kahneman and Tversky explained that judgment under uncertainty often relies on a limited number of simplifying heuristics rather than extensive algorithmic processing. Soon, this idea spread beyond academic psychology, into law, medicine, and political science. This research questioned the descriptive adequacy of idealized models of judgment, and offered insights into the cognitive processes that explained human error without invoking motivated irrationality. One simplifying strategy people may rely on is the tendency to make a judgment about the frequency of an event based on how many similar instances are brought to mind. In 1973, Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman first studied this phenomenon and labeled it the \\"availability heuristic\\". An availability heuristic is a mental shortcut that relies on immediate examples that come to a given person's mind when evaluating a specific topic, concept, method or decision. As follows, people tend to use a readily available fact to base their beliefs about a comparably distant concept. There has been much research done with this heuristic, but studies on the issue are still questionable with regard to the underlying process. Studies illustrate that manipulations intended to increase the subjective experience of ease of recall are also likely to affect the amount of recall. Furthermore, this makes it difficult to determine if the obtained estimates of frequency, likelihood, or typicality are based on participants' phenomenal experiences or on a biased sample of recalled information. However, some textbooks have chosen the latter interpretation introducing the availability heuristic as \\"one's judgments are always based on what comes to mind\\". For example, if a person is asked whether there are more words in the English language that begin with a t or k, the person will probably be able to think of more words that begin with the letter t, concluding that t is more frequent than k. Research Chapman (1967) described a bias in the judgment of the frequency with which two events co-occur. This demonstration showed that the co-occurrence of paired stimuli resulted in participants overestimating the frequency of the pairings. To test this idea, participants were given information about several hypothetical mental patients. The data for each patient consisted of a clinical diagnosis and a drawing made by the patient. Later, participants estimated the frequency with which each diagnosis had been accompanied by various features of the drawing. The subjects vastly overestimated the frequency of this co-occurrence (such as suspiciousness and peculiar eyes). This effect was labeled the illusory correlation. Tversky and Kahneman suggested that availability provides a natural account for the illusory-correlation effect. The strength of the association between two events could provide the basis for the judgment of how frequently the two events co-occur. When the association is strong, it becomes more likely to conclude that the events have been paired frequently. Strong associations will be thought of as having occurred together frequently. In Tversky & Kahneman's first examination of availability heuristics, subjects were asked, \\"If a random word is taken from an English text, is it more likely that the word starts with a K, or that K is the third letter?\\" They argue that English- speaking people would immediately think of many words that begin with the letter \\"K\\" (kangaroo, kitchen, kale), but that it would take a more concentrated effort to think of any words in which \\"K\\" is the third letter (acknowledge, ask). Results indicated that participants overestimated the number of words that began with the letter \\"K\\" and underestimated the number of words that had \\"K\\" as the third letter. Tversky and Kahneman concluded that people answer questions like these by comparing the availability of the two categories and assessing how easily they can recall these instances. In other words, it is easier to think of words that begin with \\"K\\", more than words with \\"K\\" as the third letter. Thus, people judge words beginning with a \\"K\\" to be a more common occurrence. In reality, however, a typical text contains twice as many words that have \\"K\\" as the third letter than \\"K\\" as the first letter. There are three times more words with \\"K\\" in the third position than words that begin with \\"K\\". In Tversky and Kahneman's seminal paper, they include findings from several other studies, which also show support for the availability heuristic. Apart from their findings in the \\"K\\" study, they also found: :When participants were shown two visual structures and asked to pick the structure that had more paths, participants saw more paths in the structure that had more obvious available paths. In the structure that participants chose, there were more columns and shorter obvious paths, making it more available to them. When participants were asked to complete tasks involving estimation, they would often underestimate the end result. Participants were basing their final estimation off of a quick first impression of the problem. Participants particularly struggled when the problems consisted of multiple steps. This occurred because participants were basing their estimation on an initial impression. Participants failed to account for the high rate of growth in the later steps due to the impression they formed in the initial steps. This was shown again in a task that asked participants to estimate the answer to a multiplication task, in which the numbers were presented as either 1x2x3x4x5x6x7x8 or 8x7x6x5x4x3x2x1. Participants who were presented the equation with the larger numbers first (8x7x6...), estimated a significantly higher result than participants with the lower numbers first (1x2x3...). Participants were given a short amount of time to make the estimation, thus participants based their estimates off of what was easily available, which in this case was the first few numbers in the sequence.  Explanations  Many researchers have attempted to identify the psychological process which create the availability heuristic. Tversky and Kahneman argue that the number of examples recalled from memory is used to infer the frequency with which such instances occur. In an experiment to test this explanation, participants listened to lists of names containing either 19 famous women and 20 less famous men or 19 famous men and 20 less famous women. Subsequently, some participants were asked to recall as many names as possible whereas others were asked to estimate whether male or female names were more frequent on the list. The names of the famous celebrities were recalled more frequently compared to those of the less famous celebrities. The majority of the participants incorrectly judged that the gender associated with more famous names had been presented more often than the gender associated with less famous names. Tversky and Kahneman argue that although the availability heuristic is an effective strategy in many situations, when judging probability use of this heuristic can lead to predictable patterns of errors. Schwarz and his colleagues, on the other hand, proposed the ease of retrieval explanation, in which is the ease with which examples come to mind, not the number of examples, is used to infer the frequency of a given class. In a study by Schwarz and colleagues to test their explanation, participants were asked to recall either six or twelve examples of their assertive or very unassertive behavior. Participants were later asked to rate their own assertiveness. Pretesting had indicated that although most participants were capable of generating twelve examples, this was a difficult task. The results indicated that participants rated themselves as more assertive after describing six examples of assertive compared with unassertive behavior condition, but rated themselves as less assertive after describing twelve examples of assertive compared with unassertive behavior condition. The study reflected that the extent to which recalled content impacted judgment was determined by the ease with which the content could be brought to mind (it was easier to recall 6 examples than 12), rather than the amount of content brought to mind. Research by Vaugh (1999) looked at the effects of uncertainty on the use of the availability heuristic. College students were asked to list either three or eight different study methods they could use in order to get an A on their final exams. The researchers also manipulated the time during the semester they would ask the students to complete the questionnaire. Approximately half of the participants were asked for their study methods during the third week of classes, and the other half were asked on last day of classes. Next, participants were asked to rate how likely they would be to get an A in their easiest and hardest classes. Participants were then asked to rank the difficulty they experienced in recalling the examples they had previously listed. The researchers hypothesized that students would use the availability heuristic, based on the number of study methods they listed, to predict their grade only when asked at the beginning of the semester and about their hardest final. Students were not expected to use the availability heuristic to predict their grade at the end of the semester or about their easiest final. The researchers predicted this use of availability heuristic because participants would be uncertain about their performance throughout the semester. The results indicated that students used the availability heuristic, based on the ease of recall of the study methods they listed, to predict their performance when asked at the beginning of the semester and about their hardest final. If the student listed only three study methods, they predicted a higher grade at the end of the semester only on their hardest final. If students listed eight study methods, they had a harder time recalling the methods and thus predicted a lower final grade on their hardest final. The results were not seen in the easy final condition because the students were certain they would get an A, regardless of study method. The results supported this hypothesis and gave evidence to the fact that levels of uncertainty affect the use of the availability heuristic. Applications =Media= After seeing news stories about child abductions, people may judge that the likelihood of this event is greater. Media coverage can help fuel a person's example bias with widespread and extensive coverage of unusual events, such as homicide or airline accidents, and less coverage of more routine, less sensational events, such as common diseases or car accidents. For example, when asked to rate the probability of a variety of causes of death, people tend to rate \\"newsworthy\\" events as more likely because they can more readily recall an example from memory. Moreover, unusual and vivid events like homicides, shark attacks, or lightning are more often reported in mass media than common and un-sensational causes of death like common diseases. For example, many people think that the likelihood of dying from shark attacks is greater than that of dying from being hit by falling airplane parts, when more people actually die from falling airplane parts. When a shark attack occurs, the deaths are widely reported in the media whereas deaths as a result of being hit by falling airplane parts are rarely reported in the media. In a 2010 study exploring how vivid television portrayals are used when forming social reality judgments, people watching vivid violent media gave higher estimates of the prevalence of crime and police immorality in the real world than those not exposed to vivid television. These results suggest that television violence does in fact have a direct causal impact on participants' social reality beliefs. Repeated exposure to vivid violence leads to an increase in people's risk estimates about the prevalence of crime and violence in the real world. Counter to these findings, researchers from a similar study argued that these effects may be due to effects of new information. Researchers tested the new information effect by showing movies depicting dramatic risk events and measuring their risk assessment after the film. Contrary to previous research, there were no long-term effects on risk perception due to exposure to dramatic movies. However, the study did find evidence of idiosyncratic effects of the movies - that is, people reacted immediately after the movies with enhanced or diminished risk beliefs, which faded after a period of 10 days. =Health= Researchers examined the role of cognitive heuristics in the AIDS risk-assessment process. 331 physicians reported worry about on-the-job HIV exposure, and experience with patients who have HIV. By analyzing answers to questionnaires handed out, researchers concluded that availability of AIDS information did not relate strongly to perceived risk. Participants in a 1992 study read case descriptions of hypothetical patients who varied on their sex and sexual preference. These hypothetical patients showed symptoms of two different diseases. Participants were instructed to indicate which disease they thought the patient had and then they rated patient responsibility and interaction desirability. Consistent with the availability heuristic, either the more common (influenza) or the more publicized (AIDS) disease was chosen. =Business and economy= One study sought to analyze the role of the availability heuristic in financial markets. Researchers defined and tested two aspects of the availability heuristic: * Outcome Availability ‚Äì availability of positive and negative investment outcomes, and * Risk Availability ‚Äì availability of financial risk. On days of substantial stock market moves, abnormal stock price reactions to upgrades are weaker, than those to downgrades. These availability effects are still significant even after controlling for event- specific and company-specific factors. Similarly, research has pointed out that under the availability heuristic, humans are not reliable because they assess probabilities by giving more weight to current or easily recalled information instead of processing all relevant information. Since information regarding the current state of the economy is readily available, researchers attempted to expose the properties of business cycles to predict the availability bias in analysts' growth forecasts. They showed the availability heuristic to play a role in analysis of forecasts and influence investments because of this. In effect, investors are using availability heuristic to make decisions and subsequently, may be obstructing their own investment success. An investor's lingering perceptions of a dire market environment may be causing them to view investment opportunities through an overly negative lens, making it less appealing to consider taking on investment risk, no matter how small the returns on perceived \\"safe\\" investments. To illustrate, Franklin Templeton's annual Global Investor Sentiment Survey 1 asked individuals how they believed the S&P; 500 Index performed in 2009, 2010 and 2011. 66 percent of respondents stated that they believed the market was either flat or down in 2009, 48 percent said the same about 2010 and 53 percent also said the same about 2011. In reality, the S&P; 500 saw 26.5 percent annual returns in 2009, 15.1 percent annual returns in 2010 and 2.1 percent annual returns in 2011, meaning lingering perceptions based on dramatic, painful events are impacting decision-making even when those events are over.http://www.businessinsider.com/the-availability-bias-is-driving-investor- decisions-2012-10. Franklin Templeton Investments. \\"Investors Should Beware The Role of 'Availability Bias'\\". Business Insider. Oct. 6, 2012. Dec. 1, 2013. Additionally, a study by Hayibor and Wasieleski found that the availability of others who believe that a particular act is morally acceptable is positively related to others' perceptions of the morality of that act. This suggests that availability heuristic also has an effect on ethical decision making and ethical behavior in organizations. =Education= A study done by Craig R. Fox provides an example of how availability heuristics can work in the classroom. In this study, Fox tests whether difficulty of recall influences judgment, specifically with course evaluations among college students. In his study he had two groups complete a course evaluation form. He asked the first group to write two recommended improvements for the course (a relatively easy task) and then write two positives about the class. The second group was asked to write ten suggestions where the professor could improve (a relatively difficult task) and then write two positive comments about the course. At the end of the evaluation both groups were asked to rate the course on a scale from one to seven. The results showed that students asked to write ten suggestions (difficult task) rated the course less harshly because it was more difficult for them to recall the information. Most of the students in the group that were asked to fill in 10 suggestions didn't fill in more than two being unable to recall more instances where they were unsatisfied with the class. Students asked to do the easier evaluation with only two complaints had less difficulty in terms of availability of information, so they rated the course more harshly. A study done was testing the memory of children and the ease of recall. They were asked to learn a list of names and then to recall different amounts. Researchers found that when asked to recall lower amounts compared to larger amounts and then asked what was easier to remember. They responded the shorter list going along with the theory of availability heuristic. =Criminal justice= The media usually focuses on violent or extreme cases, which are more readily available in the public's mind. This may come into play when it is time for the judicial system to evaluate and determine the proper punishment for a crime. In one study, respondents rated how much they agreed with hypothetical laws and policies such as \\"Would you support a law that required all offenders convicted of unarmed muggings to serve a minimum prison term of two years?\\" Participants then read cases and rated each case on several questions about punishment. As hypothesized, respondents recalled more easily from long-term memory stories that contain severe harm, which seemed to influence their sentencing choices to make them push for harsher punishments. This can be eliminated by adding high concrete or high contextually distinct details into the crime stories about less severe injuries. A similar study asked jurors and college students to choose sentences on four severe criminal cases in which prison was a possible but not an inevitable sentencing outcome. Respondents answering questions about court performance on a public opinion formulated a picture of what the courts do and then evaluated the appropriateness of that behavior. Respondents recalled from public information about crime and sentencing. This type of information is incomplete because the news media present a highly selective and non- representative selection of crime, focusing on the violent and extreme, rather than the ordinary. This makes most people think that judges are too lenient. But, when asked to choose the punishments, the sentences given by students were equal to or less severe than those given by judges. In other words, the availability heuristic made people believe that judges and jurors were too lenient in the courtroom, but the participants gave similar sentences when placed in the position of the judge, suggesting that the information they recalled was not correct. Researchers in 1989 predicted that mock jurors would rate a witness to be more deceptive if the witness testified truthfully before lying than when the witness was caught lying first before telling the truth. If the availability heuristic played a role in this, lying second would remain in jurors' minds (since it was more recent) and they would most likely remember the witness lying over the truthfulness. To test the hypothesis, 312 university students played the roles of mock jurors and watched a videotape of a witness presenting testimony during a trial. Results confirmed the hypothesis, as mock jurors were most influenced by the most recent act. =Perceived risk= Previous studies have indicated that explaining a hypothetical event makes the event seem more likely through the creation of causal connections. However, such effects could arise through the use of the availability heuristic; that is, subjective likelihood is increased by an event becoming easier to imagine. A study done asked those participating to pick between two illnesses. Those doing the study wanted to know which disease they thought was more likely to cause death. In the study they asked participants to choose between a stroke and asthma as to which one someone was more likely to die from. The researchers concluded that it depended on what experiences were available to them. If they knew someone or heard of someone that died from one of the diseases that is the one they perceived to be a higher risk to pass away from. =Vividness effects= Two studies with 108 undergraduates investigated vivid information and its impact on social judgment and the availability heuristic and its role in mediating vividness effects. In study 1, Subjects listened to a tape recording that described a woman who lived with her 7-year-old son. Subjects then heard arguments about the woman's fitness as a parent and were asked to draw their own conclusions regarding her fitness or unfitness. Concrete and colorful language was found to influence judgments about the woman's fitness as a mother. In study 2, a series of male and female names was presented to subjects; for each name, subjects were told the university affiliation of the individual (Yale or Stanford). When some names were presented, subjects were simultaneously shown a photograph that purportedly portrayed the named individual. Subsequently, to assess what subjects could remember (as a measure of availability), each name was re-presented, as well as the appropriate photograph if one had been originally presented. The study considered whether the display or non-display of photographs biased subjects' estimates as to the percentage of Yale (vs Stanford) students in the sample of men and women whose names appeared on the original list, and whether these estimated percentages were causally related to the respondents' memory for the college affiliations of the individual students on the list. The presence of photographs affected judgments about the proportion of male and female students at the two universities. Such effects have typically been attributed to the ready accessibility of vividly presented information in memory‚Äîthat is, to the availability heuristic. In both studies, vividness affected both availability (ability to recall) and judgments. However, causal modeling results indicated that the availability heuristic did not play a role in the judgment process. =Judging frequency and probability= In general, availability is correlated with ecological frequency, but it is also affected by other factors. Consequently, the reliance on the availability heuristic leads to systematic biases. Such biases are demonstrated in the judged frequency of classes of words, of combinatoric outcomes, and of repeated events. The phenomenon of illusory correlation is explained as an availability bias. In the original Tversky and Kahneman (1973) research, three major factors that are discussed are the frequency of repetition, frequency of co-occurrence, and illusory correlation. The use of frequency of repetition aids in the retrieval of relevant instances. The idea behind this phenomenon, is that the more an instance is repeated within a category or list, the stronger the link between the two instances becomes. Individuals then use the strong association between the instances to determine the frequency of an instance. Consequently, the association between the category or list and the specific instance, often influences frequency judgement. Frequency of co-occurrence strongly relates to Frequency of repetition, such that the more an item-pair is repeated, the stronger the association between the two items becomes, leading to a bias when estimating frequency of co-occurrence. Due to the phenomena of frequency of co- occurrence, illusory correlations also often play a big role. Another factor that affects the availability heuristic in frequency and probability is exemplars. Exemplars are the typical examples that stand out during the process of recall. If asked what participants thought different set sizes were (how many men and how many women are in the class), participants would use exemplars to determine the size of each set. Participants would derive their answer on ease of recall of the names that stood out. Participants read a list of names of members of a class for 30 seconds, and then participants were asked the male to female ratio of the class. The participant's answer would depend on the recall of exemplars. If the participant reading the list recalled seeing more common male names, such as Jack, but the only female names in the class were uncommon names, such as Deepika, then the participant will recall that there were more men than women. The opposite would be true if there were more common female names on the list and uncommon male names. Due to the availability heuristic, names that are more easily available are more likely to be recalled, and can thus alter judgments of probability. Another example of the availability heuristic and exemplars would be seeing a shark in the ocean. Seeing a shark has a greater impact on an individual's memory than seeing a dolphin. If someone sees both sharks and dolphins in the ocean, they will be less aware of seeing the dolphins, because the dolphins had less of an impact on their memory. Due to the greater impact of seeing a shark, the availability heuristic can influence the probability judgement of the ratio of sharks and dolphins in the water. Thus, an individual who saw both a shark and a dolphin would assume a higher ratio of sharks in the water, even if there are more dolphins in reality. Critiques = Ease of recall as a critique = One of the earliest and most powerful critiques of the original Tversky and Kahneman study on the availability heuristic was the Schwarz et al. study which found that the ease of recall was a key component in determining whether a concept became available. Many studies since this criticism of the original availability heuristic model have repeated this initial criticism, that the ease of recall factor became an integral facet of the availability heuristic itself (see Research section). = Alternative explanations = Much of the criticism against the availability heuristic has claimed that making use of the content that becomes available in our mind is not based on the ease of recall as suggested by Schwarz et al. For example, it could be argued that recalling more words that begin with K than words with the third letter being K could arise from how we categorize and process words into our memory. If we categorize words by first letter, and recall them through the same process, this would show more support for the representatives heuristic than the availability heuristic. Based on the possibility of explanations such as these, some researchers have claimed that the classic studies on the availability heuristic are too vague in that they fail to account for people's underlying mental processes. Indeed, a study conducted by Wanke et al. demonstrated this scenario can occur in situations used to test the availability heuristic. Future studies should be conducted to determine if and when this alternative explanation will occur. A second line of study has shown that frequency estimation may not be the only strategy we use when making frequency judgments. A recent line of research has shown that our situational working memory can access long term memories, and this memory retrieval process includes the ability to determine more accurate probabilities. This finding suggests that more research should be conducted to determine how much memory activation affects the availability heuristic.

The party had two major leaders representing its two bases of its support. Abbassi Madani appealed to pious small businessmen, and Ali Belhadj appealed to the angry, often unemployed youth of Algeria. Officially made legal as a political party in September 1989, less than a year later the FIS received more than half of valid votes cast by Algerians in the 1990 local government elections. When it appeared to be winning a general election in January 1992, a military coup dismantled the party, interning thousands of its officials in the Sahara. It was officially banned two months later.  Goals  The founders and leaders of the FIS did not agree on all issues, but agreed on the core objective of establishing an Islamic State ruled by sharia law. FIS hurriedly assembled a platform in 1989, the Projet de Programme du Front Islamique du Salut, which was widely criticized as vague. Its 1990 electoral victory, giving it control of many local governments, led to the imposing of the veil on female municipal employees, pressuring of liquor stores, video shops and other establishments perceived as un-Islamic to close, and segregation of bathing areas by gender.Kepel, Jihad, 2002: p.170-1 Elimination of the French language and culture was an important issue for many in the FIS such as co-leader Ali Benhadj, who in 1990 declared his intention \\"to ban France from Algeria intellectually and ideologically, and be done, once and for all, with those whom France has nursed with her poisoned milk.\\"Interview with Slimane Zeghidour, Politique internationale, Autumn 1990, p.156 Devout activists removed satellite dishes of households receiving European satellite broadcast in favor of Arab satellite dishes receiving Saudi broadcasts. Educationally, the party was committed to continue the Arabization of the educational system by shifting the language of instruction in more institutions, such as medical and technological schools, from French to Arabic. Large numbers of recent graduates, the first post-independence generation educated mainly in Arabic, liked this measure, as they had found the continued use of French in higher education and public life jarring and disadvantageous.Kepel, Jihad, 2002: p.173 Following the first National Assembly ballot, the FIS issued a second pamphlet. Economically, it strongly criticized Algeria's planned economy, urging the need to protect the private sector and encourage competition ‚Äì earning it support from traders and small businessmen ‚Äì and urged the establishment of Islamic banking. However, leaders Abbasi Hadani and Abdelkader Hachani both made statements opposed opening the country to competition from foreign business. Socially, it suggested that women should be given a financial incentive to stay at home rather than working outside, thus introducing sexual segregation (Ali Belhadj called it immoral for men and women to work in the same office) with the supposed goal of increasing the number of jobs available to men in a time of chronic unemployment. Politically, the contradiction between Madani and Belhadj's words was noteworthy: Madani condemned violence \\"from wherever it came\\",El Moudjahid, 26 December 1989 and expressed his commitment to democracy and resolve to \\"respect the minority, even if it is composed of one vote\\".Jeune Afrique, 12 February 1990 Belhadj said, \\"There is no democracy in Islam\\"El-Bayane, Dec. 1989 and \\"If people vote against the Law of God... this is nothing other than blasphemy. The ulama will order the death of the offenders who have substituted their authority for that of God\\".Horizons 23 February 1989 In an interview with Daniel Pipes and Patrick Clawson, Anwar Haddam rejected this view of Belhadj, saying, \\"He has been misquoted. He has been accused of things out of bitterness. He wrote a book in which he expressed himself clearly in favor of democracy. In it, he writes on page 91 that \\"the West progressed by defeating tyranny and preserving freedoms; this is the secret of the Western world's remarkable progress.\\" Belhadj refers many times to the Western world and to those very values that people are trying to deny us within our own borders.\\"\\"Anwar N. Haddam: An Islamist Vision for Algeria\\", Middle East Quarterlysee also: Shaykh Abdul-Malik ar-Ramadani al-Jaza'iri, Madarik un- Nadhr fi's-Siyasah: Bayna't-Tatbiqat ash-Shar'iyyah wa'l-Infia'lat al- Hamasiyyah [Perceptions of Viewing Politics: Between the Divinely Legislated Application and Enthusiastic Disturbances],(KSA: Dar Sabeel il-Mumineen, 1418 AH/1997 CE, 2nd Edn).  History  = Background = Social conditions that led to formation and popularity of the FIS included a population explosion in the 1960s and 70s that outstripped the stagnant economy's ability to supply jobs, housing, food and urban infrastructure to massive numbers of young in the urban areas; a collapse in price of oil, whose sale supplied 95% of Algeria's exports and 60% of the government's budget; a single-party state ostensibly based on socialism, anti-imperialism, and popular democracy but ruled by high level military and party nomenklatura from the east side of the country; \\"corruption on a grand scale\\"; and in response to these issues, \\"the most serious riots since independence\\" occurred in October 1988 when thousands of urban youth took control of the streets. Earlier Salafist movements in Algeria included the Association of Muslim Ulemas founded in 1931 by Abdel Hamid Ben Badis, which like the Muslim Brotherhood believed that religion should be the \\"absolute focus of private life and society\\", preached against the \\"superstitions\\" of popular Islam and French culture or secularism in Algeria, but did not venture into politics or promotion of an Islamic state.Kepel, Jihad, 2002: p.161-2 After independence the government of Houari Boumediene began a campaign of Arabization and Islamization against the French language which was still dominant in higher education and the professions. It recruited Egyptians to Arabize and de-Frenchify the school system, including a substantial number of Muslim Brotherhood members. Many of the generation of \\"strictly Arabphone teachers\\" trained by the Brothers adopted the beliefs of their teachers and went on to form the basis of an \\"Islamist intelligentsia\\" that made up the FIS (Ali Belhadj being a prime example).Kepel, Jihad, 2002: p.162-3 In the 1980s the government imported two renowned Islamic scholars, Mohammed al-Ghazali and Yusuf al-Qaradawi, to \\"strengthen the religious dimension\\" of the ruling National Liberation Front (FLN) party's \\"nationalist ideology\\". However, both clerics were \\"fellow travelers\\" of the Muslim Brotherhood, supporters of Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf monarchies, and supported \\"Islamic awakening\\" in Algeria, giving only \\"lip service\\" to the government.Kepel, Jihad, 2002: p.165 Another Islamist, Mustafa Bouyali, a \\"gifted inflammatory preacher\\" and veteran of the Algerian independence struggle, called for the application of the sharia and creating of an Islamic state by jihad. After persecution by the security services he founded the Mouvement Islamique Arme (MIA), \\"a loose association of tiny groups\\", with himself as amir in 1982. His group carried out a series of \\"bold attacks\\" against the regime and was able to carry it fight on underground for five years before Bouyali was killed in February 1987. Also in the 1980s, several hundred youth left Algeria for camps of Peshawar to fight jihad in Afghanistan. As Algeria was a close ally of the jihadists' enemy the Soviet Union, these jihadists tended to consider the Afghan jihad a \\"prelude\\" to jihad against the Algerian FLN.Kepel, Jihad, 2002: p.164 After the Marxist government in Afghanistan fell, many of the Salafist jihadis returned to Algeria and supported the FIS and later the GIA. Also adding to the strength of salafist \\"Islamic revivalism\\" and political Islam in Algeria was the weakness (or nonexistence) of any alternative in the form of popular Muslim brotherhoods which had been dismantled by the FLN government in retaliation for lack of support and whose land had been confiscated and redistributed by the FLN government after independence.Kepel, Jihad, 2002: p.166 During and after the 1988 October Riots, Islamists \\"set about building bridges to the young urban poor\\". The riots \\"petered out\\" after meetings between the President Chadli and Islamists Ali Belhadj and members of the Muslim Brotherhood.Kepel, Jihad, 2002: p.166-7 = Founding = On 3 November 1988, the Algerian Constitution was amended to allow parties other than the ruling FLN to operate legally. The FIS was born shortly afterwards in Algiers on 18 February 1989, led by an elderly sheikh, Abbassi Madani, and a charismatic young mosque preacher, Ali Belhadj. Its views ranged across a wide (but not complete) spectrum of Islamist opinion, exemplified by its two leaders. Abbassi Madani, a professor at University of Algiers and ex-independence fighter, represented a relatively moderate religious conservatism and symbolically connected the party to the Algerian War of Independence, the traditionally emphasized source of the ruling FLN's legitimacy. His aim was to \\"Islamise the regime without altering society's basic fabric.\\" The party came into legal existence in September 1989.Kepel, Jihad, 2002: p.169 Ali Belhadj, a high school teacher, appealed to a younger and less educated class. An impassioned orator, he was known for his ability to both enrage and calm at will the tens of thousands of young hittiestes who came to hear him speak. However, his radical speeches alarmed non-Islamists and feminists. He purportedly represented a Salafi mindset. Madani sometimes expressed support for multiparty democracy, whereas Belhadj denounced it as a potential threat to sharia. Their support of free market trading and opposition to the ruling elite also attracted middle class traders, who felt left out of the economy. As in other Muslim countries where the political system allowed opposition and free elections for the first time, the FIS benefited from being a religious party. Unlike the secular parties it had \\"a coherent network of preachers already in place.\\" Its support base increased rapidly with the help of activists preaching in friendly mosques. = 1990 local elections victory = The FIS made \\"spectactular\\" progress in the first year of its existence. The first edition of its weekly publication, Al Munqidh, was distributed to 200,000. The FIS-inspired doctors, nurses and rescue teams showed \\"devotion and effectiveness\\" helping victims of an earthquake in Tipaza Province. It organized marches and rallies and \\"applied steady pressure on the state\\" to force a promise of early elections. In the first free elections since independence on 12 June 1990, they swept the local elections with 54% of votes cast, almost double that of the FLN and far more than any of the other parties. The FIS took 46% of town assemblies and 55% of wilaya assemblies. Its supporters were especially concentrated in urban areas: it secured 93% of towns/cities of over 50,000. This was the \\"high point\\"Kepel, Jihad, 2002: p.171 of FIS influence. Its rapid rise alarmed the government, which moved to curtail the powers of local government. Once in power in local governments, its administration and its Islamic charity was praised by many as just, equitable, orderly and virtuous, in contrast to its corrupt, wasteful, arbitrary and inefficient FLN predecessors.Kepel, Jihad, 2002: p.170Luis Martinez, La guerre civile en Algerie, (Paris: Karthala, 1998), 53-81 The victory in local elections was the \\"high point\\" of FIS influence, which benefited from widespread disillusionment with the Algerian ruling party. As time went on non-core supporters began to become disenchanted. The secular, educated, salaried urban middle class began to be concerned over the anti- French language policy. The Gulf War energized the party, but brought fissures. The FIS had condemned Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait, but once it was apparent that Western intervention was inevitable, public opinion shifted and there were massive demonstrations, blood donation drives. When Binhadj delivered a speech in front of the Ministry of Defense building demanding a corp be sent to fight in Iraq's favor, the military took it as a \\"direct affront\\" and challenge to the discipline in the armed forces. (Binhadj later appealed unsuccessfully to the armed forces rank and file for a general mutiny.Kepel, Jihad, 2002: p.175) Furthermore, his co-leader Madani had received much aid from Iraq's direct enemies, Saudi Arabia and other oil monarchies, supported them and was unhappy about having to defer to Binhadj and the pro-Sadam position.Kepel, Jihad, 2002: p.172-3 = General strike and arrests of leadership = In May 1991, the FIS called for a general strike to protest the government's redrawing of electoral districts, which it saw as gerrymandering directed against it. The strike itself was a failure, but the demonstrations FIS organized in Algiers were huge. Mass sit-ins were held in one of Algiers largest squares for a week, and the FIS succeeded in pressuring the government. It was persuaded in June to call the strike off by the promise of fair parliamentary elections. However, disagreements on the strike provoked open dissension among the FIS leadership (the Madjliss ech-Choura), and the prolonged demonstrations alarmed the military. Shortly afterwards the government arrested Madani and Belhadj on 30 June 1991, having already arrested a number of lower-ranking members. The party, however, remained legal in the meantime, and passed to the effective leadership of \\"djazarists\\"Kepel, Jihad, 2002: p.174 led by Abdelkader Hachani after four days of contested leadership by Mohamed Said (who was then arrested). Despite activists anger that its demands for the leaders' release went unheeded, after some deliberation (and expulsion of dissenters such as Said Mekhloufi and Kamareddine Kherbane who advocated direct action against the government), the FIS agreed to participate in the next elections. On 26 December 1991, the FIS won the first round of parliamentary elections, although with one million fewer votes than in the earlier local elections. It won 48% of the overall popular vote, and 188 of the 231 seats contested in that round, putting them far ahead of rivals. The army saw the seeming certainty of resulting FIS rule as unacceptable. On 11 January 1992, it cancelled the electoral process, forcing President Chadli Bendjedid to resign and bringing in the exiled independence fighter Mohammed Boudiaf to serve as a new president. Many FIS members were arrested, including FIS number three leader Abdelkader Hachani on 22 January. A state of emergency was declared, and the government officially dissolved FIS on 4 March. On 12 July, Abbassi Madani and Ali Belhadj were sentenced to 12 years in prison. 40,000 FIS militants and elected FIS officials were interned in tents deep in the Sahara.Kepel, Jihad, 2002: p.258 Mosques were placed under \\"tight surveillance\\". Such activists as remained at large took this as a declaration of war, though FIS would not officially call for armed resistance until 1993, attempting to steer a nuanced course of expressing sympathy for the guerrillas without endorsing their actions. = Civil war = Many took to the hills and joined guerrilla groups. The country inexorably slid into a civil war which would claim more than 250,000 lives, from which it only began to emerge at the end of the 1990s. Initially, the guerrillas were led by members of non-FIS groups, such as Mustafa Bouyali's supporters and people who had fought in Afghanistan, although FIS itself established an underground network, led by Mohamed Said and Abderrezak Redjam, setting up clandestine newspapers and even a radio station with close links to the MIA. From late 1992, they also began issuing official statements from abroad, led by Rabah Kebir and Anwar Haddam. Soon after taking office in 1994, Liamine Zeroual began negotiations with the imprisoned FIS leadership, releasing some prisoners (including such figures as Ali Djeddi and Abdelkader Boukhamkham) by way of encouragement. These first negotiations collapsed in March, as each accused the other of reneging on agreements; but further, initially secret, negotiations would take place over the following months.  Founding of the Islamic Salvation Army  As the radical Armed Islamic Group (Groupe Islamique Arm√© or GIA), hostile to FIS as well as to the government, rose to the forefront, FIS-loyalist guerrillas, threatened with marginalization, attempted to unite their forces. In July 1994, the MIA, together with the remainder of the MEI and a variety of smaller groups, united as the Islamic Salvation Army (or AIS, a term that had previously sometimes been used as a general label for pro-FIS guerrillas), declaring their allegiance to FIS and thus strengthening FIS' hand for the negotiations. It was initially headed by MIA's Abdelkader Chebouti, who was superseded in November 1994 by MEI's Madani Mezrag. The GIA jihad strategy was designed to create an atmosphere of general insecurity, and included attacks on civilians. It rejected all truces and compromises with the government. The AIS favored a long-term jihad directed against the state and its representatives, not civilians.Kepel, Jihad, 2002: p.260 The GIA appealed to the hittistes urban youth, while the AIS support came from the pious middle class.Kepel, Jihad, 2002: p.254 By the end of 1994, the Islamic Salvation Army (AIS) controlled over half the guerrillas of the east and west, but barely 20% in the center, near the capital, where the GIA were mainly based. Their main leadership was based in the Beni Khettab mountains near Jijel. It issued communiqu√©s condemning the GIA's indiscriminate targeting of women, journalists, and other civilians \\"not involved in the repression\\", and attacking its school arson campaign. Meanwhile, following letters from Madani and Belhadj expressing a commitment to pluralistic democracy and proposing possible solutions to the crisis, the government released both from jail to house arrest on 13 September. However, no let up was observed in the fighting, and the government was unwilling to allow them to consult with FIS figures that remained in prison; the negotiations soon foundered, and at the end of October the government announced the failure of the second round of negotiations, and published incriminating letters from Belhadj that were allegedly found on the body of GIA leader Cherif Gousmi, who had been killed on 26 September. = Work in exile = A few FIS leaders, notably Rabah Kebir, had escaped into exile abroad. During 1994, they carried out negotiations in Italy with other political parties, notably the FLN and FFS, and came out with a mutual agreement on 14 January 1995: the Sant'Egidio platform. This set forth a set of principles: respect for human rights and multiparty democracy, rejection of army rule and dictatorship, recognition of Islam, Arabness, and Berberness as essential aspects of Algerianness, demand for the release of FIS leaders, and an end to extrajudicial killing and torture on all sides. To the surprise of many, even Ali Belhadj endorsed the agreement. However, a crucial signatory was missing: the government itself. As a result, the platform had little if any effect. Despite the government's extremely hostile reaction to the Rome Platform, though, a third attempt at negotiations took place, starting in April with a letter from Madani condemning acts of violence, and hopes were raised. However, the FIS did not offer enough concessions to satisfy the government, demanding, as usual, that FIS leaders should be released before FIS could call for a ceasefire. In July Zeroual announced that the talks had failed, for the last time. In 1995, the GIA turned on the AIS in earnest. Reports of battles between the AIS and GIA increased (resulting in an estimated 60 deaths in March 1995 alone), and the GIA reiterated its death threats against FIS and AIS leaders, claiming to be the \\"sole prosecutor of jihad\\" and angered by their negotiation attempts. On July 11 Abdelbaki Sahraoui, a co-founder of FIS, was assassinated in Paris; the GIA said that they were responsible, although there was no evidence supporting this. = Declaration of ceasefire = The AIS, faced with attacks from both sides and wanting to dissociate itself from the GIA's civilian massacres, declared a unilateral ceasefire on 21 September 1997 (in order to \\"unveil the enemy who hides behind these abominable massacres\\"), and disbanded in 1999. Thousands of AIS fighters surrendered and handed over their weapons to the authorities. In January 2000 those fighters obtained amnesty under the terms of the \\"Civil Concord\\" decreed by President Abdelaziz Bouteflika after his election in April 1999. Both Mezrag and Bena√Øcha offered their services to the authorities to fight the GIA and the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC), which has links to Al-Qaeda. On 2 July 2003, Belhadj and Madani were released. (The former had been in jail, the latter had been moved to house arrest in 1997) Foreign media were banned from covering the event locally, and FIS itself remains banned. However, their release has had little apparent impact. After a decade of vicious civil conflict, there was little enthusiasm in Algeria for reopening old wounds. As the civil war jihad impoverished the pious middle class, the AIS lost support to the \\"moderate\\" Islamic parties - especially the Hamas party of Mahfoud Nahnah.

This soft grey material crystallizes in an orthorhombic space group. It is the most important source for the metalloid antimony.Sabina C. Grund, K. Hanusch, H. J. Breunig, H. U. Wolf, \\"Antimony and Antimony Compounds\\" in Ullmann‚Äôs Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2006, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. The name is from the Greek œÉœÑŒØŒ≤Œπ stibi through the Latin stibium as the old name for the mineral and the element antimony.Stibnite. Handbook of MineralogyStibnite. Mindat.org Structure Structure of stibnite. Stibnite has a structure similar to that of arsenic trisulfide, As2S3. The Sb(III) centers, which are pyramidal and three-coordinate, are linked via bent two- coordinate sulfide ions. However, recent studies confirm that the actual coordination polyhedra of antimony are in fact SbS7, with (3+4) coordination at the M1 site and (5+2) at the M2 site. Some of the secondary bonds impart cohesion and are connected with packing. Stibnite is grey when fresh, but can turn superficially black due to oxidation in air.  Properties  The melting point of Sb2S3 is 823 K. The band gap is 1.88 eV at room temperature and it is a photoconductor. Uses A microscopic section of Stibnite Pastes of Sb2S3 powder in fat or in other materials have been used since ca. 3000 BC as eye cosmetics in the Mediterranean and farther afield; in this use, Sb2S3 is called kohl. It was used to darken the brows and lashes, or to draw a line around the perimeter of the eye. Antimony trisulfide finds use in pyrotechnic compositions, namely in the glitter and fountain mixtures. Needle-like crystals, \\"Chinese Needle\\", are used in glitter compositions and white pyrotechnic stars. The \\"Dark Pyro\\" version is used in flash powders to increase their sensitivity and sharpen their report. It is also a component of modern safety matches. It was formerly used in flash compositions, but its use was abandoned due to toxicity and sensitivity to static electricity.Pyrotechnic Chemical Guide. PyroUniverse.com. Retrieved on 2011-10-14. Stibnite was used ever since protodynastic Ancient Egypt as a medication and a cosmetic. The Sunan Abi Dawood reports, ‚Äúprophet Muhammad said: 'Among the best types of collyrium is antimony (ithmid) for it clears the vision and makes the hair sprout.'‚Äù The 17th century alchemist Eirenaeus Philalethes, also known as George Starkey, describes stibnite in his alchemical commentary An Exposition upon Sir George Ripley's Epistle. Starkey used stibnite as a precursor to philosophical mercury, which was itself a hypothetical precursor to the Philosopher's stone.Eirenaeus Philalethes and Carl Jung http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/rhs_0151-4105_1996_num_49_2_1254 Occurrence Stibnite occurs in hydrothermal deposits and is associated with realgar, orpiment, cinnabar, galena, pyrite, marcasite, arsenopyrite, cervantite, stibiconite, calcite, ankerite, barite and chalcedony. Small deposits of stibnite are common, but large deposits are rare. It occurs in Canada, Mexico, Peru, Japan, China, Germany, Romania, Italy, France, England, Algeria, and Kalimantan, Borneo. In the United States it is found in Arkansas, Idaho, Nevada, California, and Alaska. As of May 2007, the largest specimen on public display (1000 pounds) is at the American Museum of Natural History.

Biography =Early years= He was born at Auchtermuchty, Fife, where his father was parish minister. He was educated at Kinclaven and Perth Grammar School, graduated from the University of St Andrews in 1713, and completed his education for the ministry at Edinburgh. He was licensed as a preacher by the presbytery of Dunkeld, and soon afterwards ordained by that of Dundee as minister of the parish of Tealing (1719), where his preaching soon drew a large congregation. Early in his ministry he was brought to a halt while lecturing on the Shorter Catechism by the question \\"How doth Christ execute the office of a king?\\" This led to an examination of the New Testament foundation of the Christian Church, and in 1725, in a letter to Francis Archibald, minister of Guthrie, Forfarshire, he repudiated the obligation of national covenants. =Separate society= In the same year he formed a society separate from the multitude, numbering nearly a hundred, and drawn from his own and neighbouring parishes. The members of this ecclesiola in ecclesia pledged themselves to join together in the Christian profession, to follow Christ the Lord as the righteousness of his people, to walk together in brotherly love, and in the duties of it, in subjection to Glas as their overseer in the Lord, to observe the Lord's Supper once a month and to submit themselves to the Lord's law for removing offences. From the scriptural doctrine of the essentially spiritual nature of the kingdom of Christ, Glas in his public teaching drew the conclusions that: * there is no warrant in the New Testament for a national church * the magistrate as such has no function in the church * National Covenants are without scriptural grounds * the true Reformation cannot be carried out by political and secular weapons but by the word and spirit of Christ only. =Treatise= Glasite Meeting House, Edinburgh (1835) Glasite pulpit by David Bryce This argument is most fully exhibited in a treatise entitled The Testimony of the King of Martyrs (1729). For the promulgation of these views, which were at variance with the doctrines of the national church of Scotland, he was summoned (1726) before his presbytery, where in the course of being investigated, he affirmed his belief that every national church established by the laws of earthly kingdoms is anti-Christian in its constitution and persecuting in its spirit, and further declared opinions upon the subject of church government which amounted to a repudiation of Presbyterianism and an acceptance of the puritan type of Independence. =Suspension from ministry= For these opinions he was in 1728 suspended from his ministerial functions, and finally deposed in 1730. The members of the society already referred to, however, for the most part continued to adhere to him, thus constituting the first Glassite or Glasite church. The seat of this congregation was shortly afterwards transferred to Dundee (whence Glas subsequently removed to Edinburgh), where he officiated for some time as an elder. He next laboured in Perth for a few years, where he was joined by Robert Sandeman,Perth Entrepreneurs: the Sandemans of Springfield by Charles D Waterston, 2008, pages 22‚Äì26: these pages reference other information sources. who married his daughter Catherine ‚Äî eventually Sandeman was recognized as the leader and principal exponent of Glas's views; these he developed in a direction which laid them open to the charge of antinomianism. =Restoration to ministry= Ultimately in 1730 Glas returned to Dundee for the remainder of his life. He introduced in his church the primitive custom of the osculum pacis and the agape celebrated as a common meal with broth. From this custom his congregation was known as 'the kail kirk'. In 1739 the General Assembly, without any appeal from him, removed the sentence of deposition against him, and restored him to the status of a minister of the gospel of Christ, but not that of a minister of the Established Church of Scotland, declaring that he was not eligible for a charge until he should have renounced principles inconsistent with the constitution of the church. =Personal life= Glas married Catharine Black, the eldest daughter of a Perth minister in 1721. The couple had a happy marriage and brought forth 15 children ‚Äì all of whom predeceased him, as did his wife, who died of tuberculosis in 1749, 24 years before him. His son, captain George Glas R.N. was murdered along with his wife and daughter on board a treasure ship traveling from Tenerife to London in 1765. The case was notorious at the time and is believed to be the inspiration behind R.S. Stevenson‚Äôs ‚ÄòTreasure Island‚Äô. Stevenson grew up beside the Glasite church in Edinburgh and the family may have worshiped there. According to the accounts of the time, Glas was a most kind-hearted man, very fond of children, a most humane man, with not a trace of fanaticism or bigotry. One daughter Agnes Glas married Hector Turnbull who developed bleachfields in Luncarty near Perth. John Glas died on 2 November 1773 and was buried at The Howff in Dundee on 5 November 1773.https://www.fdca.org.uk/pdf%20files/HowffG04.pdf The grave lies in the south west near a north-south path. The original sandstone monument eroded and was replaced by a long-lasting red granite monument around 1880. =Non-Denominational Christianity= As Glas found inconsistencies with the Church of Scotland and what he found in the New Testament, he led a church movement during the first half of the 18th century which promoted the ideal that the church should be governed by the simple order in the New Testament rather than by human councils and synods. About thirty Churches of Christ were established in Great Britain through the efforts of Glas and others, including his son in law, Robert Sandeman. These churches emphasized the wearing of only New Testament names - usually \\"Church of Christ,\\" taught baptism is for the remission of sins, and practiced a cappella singing in worship. Publications Glas's published works bear witness to his vigorous mind and scholarly attainments. His reconstruction of the True Discourse ef Celsus (1753), from Origen's reply to it, is a competent and learned piece of work. The Testimony of the King of Martyrs concerning His Kingdom (1729) is a classic repudiation of erastianism and defence of the spiritual autonomy of the church under Jesus Christ. His common sense appears in his rejection of John Hutchinson's attempt to prove that the Bible supplies a complete system of physical science, and his shrewdness in his Notes on Scripture Texts (1747). He published a volume of Christian Songs (Perth, 1784; 13th ed., 1847). A collected edition of his works was published at Edinburgh in 1761 (4 vols., 8vo), and again at Perth in 1782 (5 vols., 8vo). Legacy Though the Glasite Church is now 'extinct', certain former Glasite chapels, which tended to be of unusual form, survive, e.g. in Edinburgh, Dundee and Perth. The former Dundee Glasite church is still used for religious purposes, having been acquired by the adjacent St Andrews Parish Church in 1973 and transformed into part of a complex of halls. The archives of the Glasite Church are held by Archive Services, University of Dundee.

Glas continued to preach his vision over the next five years. The General Assembly's response to Glas's publication of Testimony of the king of martyrs concerning his kingdom (1727) was to depose him in October 1728. The Church's deposition was enacted on 12 March 1730. See pages 19-21 of Geoffrey Cantor (1991).See page 75 of Hiram Van Kirk's doctoral dissertation (1907). Glas's faith, as part of the First Great Awakening, was spread by his son-in-law Robert Sandeman into England and America, where the members were called Sandemanians.Smith (2008), p. 37. Glas dissented from the Westminster Confession only in his views as to the spiritual nature of the church and the functions of the civil magistrate. But Sandeman added a distinctive doctrine as to the nature of faith which is thus stated on his tombstone: :That the bare death of Jesus Christ without a thought or deed on the part of man, is sufficient to present the chief of sinners spotless before God.For the entire quote, see page 112 of The Society's (1904) Transactions, Volume 6. In a series of letters to James Hervey, the author of Theron and Aspasio, Sandeman maintained that justifying faith is a simple assent to the divine testimony concerning Jesus, differing in no way in its character from belief in any ordinary testimony.Hervey's doctrine of \\"imputed righteousness\\" called for select individuals as being predestined and having a special relationship with God. Glas viewed this position as being self-serving and devoid of Biblical support. See page 24 of Cantor (1991). This exchange of ideas between Hervey and Sandeman in 1757 (as a continuation of the rift initiated by Glas in the late 1720s) was discussed, argued, and anguished over leaving many Christians throughout England and beyond looking for an alternative. This debate set the stage for Sandeman's correspondence and journeys south from Scotland to establish apostolic gatherings and his subsequent 1764 move to Boston.  Beliefs and practice  Sandemanian graveyard, Gayle, Yorkshire In their practice the Glasite churches aimed at a strict conformity with the primitive type of Christianity, as understood by them. Each congregation had a plurality of elders, pastors, or bishops, who were chosen according to what were believed to be the instructions of Paul, without regard to previous education or present occupation, and who enjoy a perfect equality in office.See pages 27 and 31 of Cantor (1991). The role of the elder (or bishop) was to teach and lead the congregation, while the role of the deacon (or deaconess), as defined in Timothy, was to provide for the poor and infirm. Two elders, as referenced in Acts, were required for a church to function, and a plurality was required to celebrate the Lord's Supper. The Edinburgh meeting house closed in 1989 when its membership fell to only one elder. To have been married a second time disqualified one for ordination, or for continued tenure of the office of bishop. In all the action of the church unanimity was considered to be necessary; if any member differed in opinion from the rest, he must either surrender his judgement to that of the church, or be shut out from its communion.See pages 31-2 of Cantor (1991). Exclusion, following I Corinthians, was the first of two steps to excommunication from which there was no return. Eating with immediate family was allowed during exclusion. Estimates indicate that roughly half the membership was excluded at one time or another, while only a tenth left permanently. To join in prayer with anyone not a member of the denomination was regarded as unlawful, and even to eat or drink with one who had been excommunicated was held to be wrong. The Lord's Supper was observed weekly; and between forenoon and afternoon service every Sunday a love feast was held at which every member was required to be present. This took the form not of symbolic morsels of wine and bread, as in other communions, but a (relatively) substantial meal, a custom leading to the Glasites' nickname of 'Kail Kirk' for the Scotch broth that was served at this setting.See page 58 of Cantor (1991). This custom may have arisen, in part, as a charitable response to the poverty of most members of this Church and also as a pragmatic response to the length of meetings (particularly the sermons) and the distances some members of the congregation had to travel in order to attend. At Glasite services, any member who \\"possesses the gift of edifying the brethren\\", was allowed to speak. The practice of washing one another's feet was at one time observed; and it was for a long time customary for each brother and sister to receive new members, on admission, with a holy kiss. \\"Things strangled and blood\\" were rigorously abstained from. They disapproved of all lotteries and games of chance. The accumulation of wealth they held to be unscriptural and improper.  Churches  2009 photo of Glasite Church building in Dundee A church was set up by Glas in Dundee following his suspension by the Church of Scotland, with its congregation becoming known as Glasites. The first meeting house in Perth followed in 1733. Glasite churches were also founded in Paisley, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Leith, Arbroath, Montrose, Aberdeen, Dunkeld, Cupar, Galashiels. Buildings built as Glasite chapels survive in Dundee, Edinburgh and Perth (two), Galashiels and possibly elsewhere.Figure 2.1 is a map of Britain showing the location of some 40 churches (meeting houses). His research breaks out the dates of closure of these various churches. The key window is from 1821 to 1867, or the middle period of closure. In addition to these British locations, Robert Sandeman added a handful of churches to America prior to his 1771 death in Danbury, Connecticut. See page 26 of Cantor (1991). = Sandemanian Churches in England = Glas's views were again advanced beyond Scotland with Sandeman's publication of Letters on Theron and Aspasio in 1757. The resulting correspondence between the leading church elders, Glas and Sandeman, and English pastors, Samuel Pike, John Barnard, and William Cudworth among others, led to the adoption of this primitive form of Christianity for their London congregations beginning in the early 1760s.See pages 71, 78-81 of Smith (2008). John Barnard's petition to Robert Sandeman brought the latter south to London from Scotland in April 1761 with his brother William and John Handasyde, an Elder from the Northumberland meeting house. This visit led to the establishment of the first legitimately constituted Sandemanian congregation on 23 March 1762 at Glover's Hall.See page 213 of Elmes (1831). To accommodate larger gatherings, this congregation moved initially to the Bull and Mouth-Street, St. Martin's Le Grand, and then to Paul's Alley in the Barbican in the autumn of 1778.For the history of the Sandemanian Meeting Houses in London see pages 220-1, and 261-276 of Wilson (1810), iii. This text cites 1778 as the year the London congregation relocated to Paul‚Äôs Alley in the Barbican.This note references the Supplementary letters. See note 30 on page 83 of Smith (2008). This third London meeting house was that of Michael Faraday's youth.John Barnard, uncle of Michael Faraday's father-in-law, Edward, brought followers to his London meeting house, named Glover's Hall around 1760. The 4th London meeting house found in Barnsbury Grove, and Michael Faraday's seat located within were commemorated by Lord Kelvin in 1906. See pages 38-43 of Cantor (1991). The London church record books show 106 members in 1795 (48 men, 58 women) and 110 members in 1842 (31 men, 79 women). These numbers only include those that confessed their faith. They do not include non-members who attended or children. These numbers held steady throughout this period of time. The Sandemanians relocated to Barnsbury Grove, in north London, in 1862 where they met until nearly the turn of the century. Michael Faraday was a Deacon at Paul's Alley in the Barbican during the 1830s, an Elder there from 1840 to 1844 and again from 1860 to 1864, the final two years of which were at the Barnsbury Grove meeting house (see 2008 photographSee page 42 of Cantor (1991). Comparison of 2008 photo to that of figure 3.2 indicates substantial renovation work was done to include new roof, the addition of a second story, and facades removed to bare brick. The first story window shapes and placement of the front door provide the only linkages between the structures.).See pages 60-4, and 277-80 of Cantor (1991). Faraday's ordination service as Deacon took place on 1 July 1832, indicating his high moral standing within the community. As might be expected, controversy surrounds Faraday's (and others) 1844 exclusion and subsequent removal from his position as Elder. His resignation on 5 June 1864, after being reinstated as Elder four years earlier, is connected with an offer to assume the Presidency of the Royal Institution, an offer he declined. A plaque was installed in the building indicating his seat of prayer. The building was converted into a telephone exchange, and that end of Barnsbury Grove renamed Faraday Close. Barnsbury Grove, Islington. 2008 photo of a 19th-century Sandemanian meeting house  Beyond London  Pulpit in the Glasite Meeting House, Edinburgh As the congregation at the Bull and Mouth-Street, St. Martins-le-Grand, London solidified through the inclusion of noted pastors like Samuel Pike in 1765, other English parishes followed their Sandemanian lead.See page 96 of Wilson (1810), Volume 2. The first response outside London occurred in Yorkshire with followers of Benjamin Ingham. Ingham discreetly sent two of his preachers, James Allen and William Batty, to Scotland to observe Glasite practices in 1761. Of these three Methodist preachers, only Allen fully converted and began to establish Sandemanian meeting houses in Northern England, to include his hometown of Gayle, Kirkby Stephen, Newby, and Kirkby Lonsdale. By 1768 Allen, together with John Barnard and William Cudworth from London, helped establish congregations in York, Norfolk, Colne, Wethersfield, Liverpool, Whitehaven, Trowbridge and Nottingham.See pages 82-6 of Smith (2008). Sandeman personally established fewer than a dozen churches in England including Liverpool before he went to America in 1764.See pages 24, 26, and 27 of Cantor (1991). He was accompanied by James Cargill to Boston where he met Ezra Stiles, President of Yale. The Trowbridge meeting house, in Wiltshire, was the location to which Samuel Pike moved and at which he preached for the final two years until his death in 1773.See pages 96 and 97 of Wilson, volume 2. =Sandemanian Churches in America= Robert Sandeman sailed into Boston from Glasgow aboard the George and James, captained by Montgomery, on 18 October 1764.See page 51 of Sandemanian Society (1870). At the invitation of Ezra Stiles, Sandeman preached his first sermon in Newport on 28 November. He spent Christmas and most of January 1765 in Danbury, Connecticut, discussing theology and church governance with Ebenezer White and his followers. Over the next four months Sandeman and his party travelled to New York, Philadelphia, New London, Connecticut, Providence, Rhode Island, and finally Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Sandeman established his first church in Portsmouth on 4 May 1765 accompanied by James Cargill, Andrew Oliphant, and his nephews. Within the month Sandeman returned to Boston and established his second meetinghouse in the home of Edward Foster. From Boston, he returned to Danbury and created his third church among White's followers with Joseph Moss White and himself serving as elders.See pages 113-4 of Smith (2008) Sandeman referred to his church as formal to distinguish it from Ebenezer White's church that retained traditional church authority. Colonial resistance to Sandemanianism initially stemmed from the absence of ministerial authority within their congregations. This lack of a central authority challenged the existing social fabric throughout New England which relied upon the state to enforce church orthodoxy. As many colonials rose up in protest of punitive Crown policies in the decade following Robert Sandeman's arrival, his followers remained passively loyal, in Paul's footsteps, setting the stage for bitter estrangement between the factions.See pages 94 and 115-20 of Smith (2008). Chapter 5 documents several examples of Sandemanian persecution at the hands of colonials due to their passive stance. It was not until Sandeman's passing in 1771 that the remnants of the Danbury church moved to New Haven and formed the fourth church in America. Sandemanians as a whole were labeled ‚ÄúLoyalists‚Äù for their pacifist stance, to conform with Paul's teachings, since they did not oppose the crown like so many of their colonial brethren.See pages 133-4 of Smith (2008).For a picture of the Danbury Meeting House, see page 373 of Barber (1836). This text places the location of the fourth church on Gregson Street. In addition to passivism, many of the Boston congregation evacuated with the British and went into exile in Halifax, Nova Scotia, further escalating the fears of their colonial brethren. This relocation to Halifax lead to the formation of the fifth church. A Boston printer, Mr. John Howe, followed the British lead to Canada with his family only to return alone with the British army to document the unfolding war story upon its return to New York.See pages 137, 143 and 148 of Smith (2008). It is unclear if Mr. Howe established any churches either in New York or on Long Island while there with the British army.The article The Places of Worship of the Sandemanians in Boston written by Henry Herbert Edes found on pages 109-133 in Publications of the Colonial Society of Massachusetts, Volume 6, published in Boston 1904 By Colonial Society of Massachusetts provides a listing of colonial Sandemanians living in and around Boston. Horace Marshall, in his article History of Danbury, mentions two additional Sandemanian congregations located south of Boston in Newtown and Taunton, Massachusetts. It is not clear what role, if any, Robert Sandeman played in the establishment of these congregations, though the Boston records indicate he performed several marriages in that city during the winter and spring of 1767 to 1768.See Sandeman in The twentieth century biographical dictionary of notable Americans published by the Boston Biographical Society in 1904.Records Relating to the Early History of Boston containing Boston Marriages from 1752-1809 (1884), Volume 30 By Boston (Mass. ) Registry Dept. A great many Loyalist Sandemanians were uprooted during the revolution and lost most of their property.Their subsequent stories can be found in Biographical sketches of Loyalists of the American Revolution, with an Historical Essay, Volume 1, by Lorenzo Sabine. Published by Little, Brown & Co. in Boston 1864. John Howe's story exemplifies this situation. In his case, he sailed to Nova Scotia and became an elder in the congregation that formed.See page 25 of Blakeley and Grant (1864). =Decline= The last of the Sandemanian churches in America ceased to exist in 1890. The London meeting house finally closed in 1984.See page 41 of Cantor (1991). The last Elder of the Church died in Edinburgh in 1999. Their exclusiveness in practice, neglect of education for the ministry, and the antinomian tendency of their doctrine contributed to their dissolution.See pages 30 and 31 of Ross (1900). Many Glasites joined the general body of Scottish Congregationalists, and the denomination may now be considered extinct.  Critics of Sandemanianism  A prominent critic of Sandemanian beliefs was Baptist Andrew Fuller (1754‚Äì1815), who published Strictures on Sandemanianism (1812), in which he argued that if faith concerns the mind only, then there could be no way to distinguish genuine Christians from nominal Christians. He also argued that knowing Christ is more than mental knowledge of facts about Him; it involves a desire for fellowship with Him and a delight in His presence.See pages 61, and 111-114 of Fuller (1812). John \\"Rabbi\\" Duncan said once that Sandemanianism was \\"the doctrine of justifying righteousness along with the Popish doctrine of faith.\\"See page 158 of Brentnall (1997). Sandemanian families and notable members Prominent Sandemanian families include the surnames Barnard, Baynes, Baxter, Boosey, Bell, Deacon, Faraday, Leighton, Mann, Vincent, Whitelaw and Young. There was a strong link between the Sandemanians and scientists.

Almost all of it is located outside Anatolia, on the eastern coast of the Levantine Sea. The administrative capital is Antakya (Antioch), and the port city of ƒ∞skenderun (Alexandretta). It is bordered by Syria to the south and east and the Turkish provinces of Adana and Osmaniye to the north. The province is part of √áukurova (Cilicia), a geographical, economical and cultural region that covers the provinces of Mersin, Adana, Osmaniye, and Hatay. There are border crossing points with Syria in the district of Yayladaƒüƒ± and at Cilveg√∂z√º in the district of Reyhanlƒ±. Sovereignty over the province remains disputed with neighbouring Syria, which claims that the province was separated from itself against the stipulations of the French Mandate of Syria in the years following Syria's independence from the Ottoman Empire after World War I. Although the two countries have remained generally peaceful in their dispute over the territory, Syria has never formally renounced its claims to it.  History  = Antiquity = Settled since the early Bronze Age, Hatay was once part of the Akkadian Empire, then of the Amorite Kingdom of Yamhad. Later, it became part of the Kingdom of Mitanni, then the area was ruled by a succession of Hittites and Neo-Hittite peoples that later gave the modern province of Hatay its name. The Neo-Hittite kingdom of Palistin was also located here. The area came under the control of Assyrians (except for a brief occupation by Urartu), and later the Neo-Babylonians and the Persians. The region was the center of the Hellenistic Seleucid empire, home to the four Greek cities of the Syrian tetrapolis (Antioch, Seleucia Pieria, Apamea, and Laodicea). From 64 BC onwards the city of Antioch became an important regional centre of the Roman Empire. Among the famous archaeological sites in the province are Alalakh, Tell Tayinat, Tell Judaidah, and Antioch. = Medieval era = The area was conquered by the Rashidun Caliphate in 638 and later it came under the control of the Ummayad and Abbasid Arab dynasties. From the 11th century onwards, the region was controlled by the Aleppo-based Hamdanids after a brief rule of Ikhshidids. In 969 the city of Antioch was recaptured by the Byzantine Empire. It was conquered by Philaretos Brachamios, a Byzantine general in 1078. He founded a principality from Antioch to Edessa. It was captured by Suleiman I, who was Sultan of Rum (ruler of Anatolian Seljuks), in 1084. It passed to Tutush I, Sultan of Aleppo (ruler of Syria Seljuks), in 1086. Seljuk rule lasted 14 years until Hatay's capture by the Crusaders in 1098, when parts of it became the centre of the Principality of Antioch. At the same time, much of Hatay was part of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia, who subsequently allied with the Mongols and took control of the Principality of Antioch in 1254. Hatay was captured from the Mongol-Armenian alliance by the Mameluks in 1268, who subsequently lost it to Timur (Tamerlane) at the start of the 15th century. = Sanjak of Alexandretta = By the time it was taken from the Mameluks by the Ottoman Sultan Selim I in 1516, Antakya was a medium-sized town on 2 km¬≤ of land between the Orontes River and Mount Habib Neccar. Under the Ottomans the area was known as the sanjak (or governorate) of Alexandretta. Gertrude Bell in her book Syria The Desert & the Sown published in 1907 wrote extensively about her travels across Syria including Antioch & Alexandretta and she noted the heavy mix between Turks and Arabs in the region at that time. A map published circa 1911 highlighted that the ethnic make up (Alexandretta) was majority Arab with smaller communities of Armenians and Turks. Ethnic groups in the Balkans and Asia Minor, early 20th Century, Historical Atlas, 1911 Many consider that Alexandretta had been traditionally part of Syria. Maps as far back as 1764 confirm this. During the First World War in which the Ottoman Empire was defeated most of Syria was occupied by the British forces. But when the Armistice of Mudros was signed at the end of the war, Hatay was still part of the Ottoman Empire. Nevertheless, after the armistice it was occupied by the British forces an operation which was never accepted by the Ottoman side. Later like the rest of Syria it was handed to France by the British Empire. After World War I and the Turkish War of Independence, the Ottoman Empire was disbanded and the modern Republic of Turkey was created, and Alexandretta was not part of the new republic, it was put within the French mandate of Syria after a signed agreement between the Allies and Turkey, the Treaty of S√®vres, which was neither ratified by the Ottoman parliament nor by the Turkish National Movement in Ankara.William M. Hale Turkish Foreign Policy, 1774‚Äì2000 p.45 Routledge, 2000 , 9780714650715 The subsequent Treaty of Lausanne also put Alexandretta within Syria. The document detailing the boundary between Turkey and Syria around 1920 and subsequent years is presented in a report by the Official Geographer of The Bureau of Intelligence and Research of the US Department of State. A French- Turkish treaty of 20 October 1921 rendered the Sanjak of Alexandretta autonomous, and remained so from 1921 to 1923. Out of 220,000 inhabitants in 1921, 87,000 were Turks. Along with Turks the population of the Sanjak included: Arabs of various religious denominations (Sunni Muslims, Alawites, Greek Orthodox); Greek Catholics, Syriac-Maronites; Jews; Syriacs; Kurds; and Armenians. In 1923 Hatay was attached to the State of Aleppo, and in 1925 it was directly attached to the French mandate of Syria, still with special administrative status. Turkish borders according to the Treaty of Lausanne, 1923 Despite this, a Turkish community remained in Alexandretta, and Mustafa Kemal said that Hatay had been a Turkish homeland for 4,000 years. This was due to the contested nationalist pseudoscientific Sun Language Theory prevalent in the 1930s in Turkey, which presumed that some ancient peoples of Anatolia and the Middle East such as the Sumerians and Hittites, hence the name Hatay, were related to the Turks. In truth, the Turks first appeared in Anatolia during the 11th century when the Seljuk Turks occupied the eastern province of the Abbasid Empire and captured Baghdad.. Resident Arabs organised under the banner of Arabism, and in 1930, Zaki al-Arsuzi, a teacher and lawyer from Arsuz on the coast of Alexandretta published a newspaper called 'Arabism' in Antioch that was shut down by Turkish and French authorities. The 1936 elections returned two MPs favouring the independence of Syria from France, and this prompted communal riots as well as passionate articles in the Turkish and Syrian press. This then became the subject of a complaint to the League of Nations by the Turkish government concerning alleged mistreatment of the Turkish populations. Atat√ºrk demanded that Hatay become part of Turkey claiming that the majority of its inhabitants were Turks. However, the French High Commission estimated that the population of 220,000 inhabitants was made up of 46% Arabs (28% Alawites, 10% Sunni, 8% Christians), 39% Turks, 11% Armenians, while the remaining 4% was made up of Circassians, Jews, and Kurds. The sanjak was given autonomy in November 1937 in an arrangement brokered by the League. Under its new statute, the sanjak became 'distinct but not separated' from the French mandate of Syria on the diplomatic level, linked to both France and Turkey for defence matters. =Hatay State= Turkish forces under Colonel entered Alexandretta (ƒ∞skenderun) on July 5, 1938. =Hatay Province of Turkey= On 29 June 1939, following a referendum, Hatay became a Turkish province. This referendum has been labelled both \\"phoney\\" and \\"rigged\\", and a way for the French to let Turks take over the area, hoping that they would turn on Hitler. For the referendum, Turkey moved tens of thousands of Turks into Alexandretta to vote. These were Turks born in Hatay who were now living elsewhere in Turkey. In two government communiqu√©s in 1937 and 1938, the Turkish government asked all local government authorities to make lists of their employees originally from Hatay. Those listed were then sent to Hatay to register as citizens and vote.√áaƒüatay, Soner. Islam, secularism, and nationalism in modern Turkey: who is a Turk? Volume 4 of Routledge studies in Middle Eastern history. p. 119-120. Taylor & Francis, 2006. , Syrian President Hashim al-Atassi resigned in protest at continued French intervention in Syrian affairs, maintaining that the French were obliged to refuse the annexation under the Franco-Syrian Treaty of Independence of 1936. The Hassa district of Gaziantep, D√∂rtyol district (Erzin was nahiya of it) of Adana were then incorporated into Hatay. As a result of the annexation, a number of demographic changes occurred in Hatay. During the six months following the annexation, inhabitants over the age of 18 were given the right to choose between staying and becoming Turkish citizens, or emigrate to and acquire citizenship in the French Mandate of Syria or Greater Lebanon. If choosing emigration, they were given 18 months to bring in their movable assets and establish themselves in their new states. Almost half of the Sunni Arabs left. Many Armenians also left and 1,068 Armenian families were relocated from the six Armenian villages of Musa Dagh to Beqaa Valley in Lebanon. Many of the Armenians had been prior victims of the Armenian Genocide committed by Ottoman Empire that had fled for their lives to the French Mandate of Syria. The total number of people who left for Syria is estimated at 50,000 including 22,000 Armenians, 10,000 Alawites, 10,000 Sunni Arabs and 5,000 Arab Christians. =Turkish‚ÄìSyrian dispute= In Ottoman times, Hatay was part of the Vilayet of Aleppo in Ottoman Syria. After World War I, Hatay (then known as Alexandretta) became part of the French Mandate of Syria. Unlike other regions historically belonging to Syrian provinces (such as Aintab, Kilis and Urfa), Alexandretta was confirmed as Syrian territory in the Treaty of Lausanne agreed upon by Kemal Atat√ºrk; although it was granted a special autonomous status because it contained a large Turkish minority. However, culminating a series of border disputes with France-mandated Syria, Atat√ºrk obtained in 1937 an agreement with France recognizing Alexandretta as an independent state, and in 1939 this state, called the Republic of Hatay, was annexed to Turkey as the 63rd Turkish province following a controversial referendum. Syria bitterly disputed both the separation of Alexandretta and its subsequent annexation to Turkey. Syria maintains that the separation of Alexandretta violated France's mandatory responsibility to maintain the unity of Syrian lands (article 4 of the mandate charter). It also disputes the results of the referendum held in the province because, according to a League of Nations commission that registered voters in Alexandretta in 1938, Turkish voters in the province represented no more than 46% of the population.Arnold Twinby, 1938 Survey of International Affairs p. 484 Syria continues to consider Hatay part of its territory as of the 2010s, and shows it as such on its maps. At the same time, Turkey and Syria have strengthened their ties and opened the border between the two countries. Protests in Damascus in 1939 by women demonstrators against the secession of the Sanjak of Alexandretta, and its subsequent joining into Turkey as the Hatay Province. One of the signs reads: \\"Our blood is sacrificed for the Syrian Arab Sanjak.\\" Syrians hold the view that this land was illegally ceded to Turkey by France, the mandatory occupying power of Syria in the late 1930s. Syria still considers it an integral part of its own territory. Syrians call this land Liwa' aliskenderun () rather than the Turkish name of Hatay. Official Syrian maps still show Hatay as part of Syria.parliament.gov.sy ‚Äì ŸÖÿπŸÑŸàŸÖÿßÿ™ ÿπŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿ¨ŸÖŸáŸàÿ±Ÿäÿ© ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿ®Ÿäÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ≥Ÿàÿ±Ÿäÿ© \\"The Alexandretta Dispute\\", American Journal of International Law Under the leadership of Syrian President Bashar al Assad from 2000 onwards, there was a lessening of tensions over the Hatay issue. Indeed, in early 2005, when visits from Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer and Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan opened a way to discussions between two states. These discussions resulted with the Syrian government agreeing to end its demand that the province should be returned under Syrian sovereignty as a condition to end hostilities; however, there was no official announcement by the Syrians relinquishing their rights of sovereignty. Following changes to Turkish land registry legislation in 2003 a large number of properties in Hatay were purchased by Syrian nationals, mostly people who had been residents of Hatay since the 1930s but had retained their Syrian citizenship and were buying the properties that they already occupied. By 2006 the amount of land owned by Syrian nationals in Hatay exceeded the legal limit for foreign ownership of 0.5%, and sale of lands to foreigners was prohibited. There has been a policy of cross border co-operation, on the social and economic level, between Turkey and Syria starting in the 2000s. This allowed families divided by the border to freely visit each other during the festive periods of Christmas and Eid. In December 2007 up to 27,000 people crossed the border to visit their brethren on the other side. In the wake of an agreement in the autumn of 2009 to lift visa requirements, nationals of both countries can travel freely. However, out of 50 agreements signed between Turkey and Syria in December 2009, the Hatay dispute stalled a water agreement over the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers. Turkey asked Syria to publicly recognize Hatay as a Turkish territory before signing on to the agreement.PM vows to build model partnership with Syria Today's Zaman 23 December 2010 Apart from maps showing Hatay as Syrian territory, the Syrian policy has been to avoid discussing Hatay and giving evasive answers when asked to specify Syrian future goals and ambitions with regard to the area. This has included a complete media silence on the issue.Lundgren J√∂rum, Emma: \\"The Importance of the Unimportant\\" in Hinnebusch, Raymond & T√ºr, √ñzlem: Turkey-Syria Relations: Between Enmity and Amity (Farnham: Ashgate), p 114-122. In February 2011 the dispute over Hatay was almost solved. The border separating Syria from Hatay was going to be blurred by a shared Friendship Dam on the Orontes river and as part of this project the two states had agreed on the national jurisdiction on each side of the border. Only weeks before the outbreak of the Syrian uprising and later war, groundbreaking ceremonies were held in Hatay and Idlib. As a result of the Syrian war and the extremely tense Turkish-Syrian relations it brought, construction was halted. As part of the ongoing war, the question of the sovereignty of Hatay has resurfaced in Syria and the Syrian media silence has been broken. Syrian media began broadcasting documentaries on the history of the area, the Turkish annexation and \\"Turkification\\" policies. Syrian newspapers have also reported on demonstrations in Hatay and on organizations and parties in Syria demanding an \\"end to the Turkish occupation\\". However, although the Syrian government has repeatedly criticized the Turkish policies towards Syria and the armed rebel groups operating on Syrian territory, it has not officially brought up the question of Hatay.Lundgren J√∂rum, Emma: Beyond Syria's Borders: A history of territorial disputes in the Middle East (London & New York: I.B. Tauris), p 108 Geography Baƒüras in Hatay Hatay is traversed by the north-easterly line of equal latitude and longitude. 46% of the land is mountain, 33% plain and 20% plateau and hillside. The most prominent feature is the north-south leading Nur Mountains and the highest peak is Mƒ±ƒüƒ±rtepe (2240m), other peaks include Ziyaret daƒüƒ± and Keldaƒü (Jebel Akra or Casius) at 1739 m. The folds of land that make up the landscape of the province were formed as the land masses of Arabian-Nubian Shield and Anatolia have pushed into each other, meeting here in Hatay, a classic example of the Horst‚Äìgraben formation. The Orontes River rises in the Bekaa Valley in Lebanon and runs through Syria and Hatay, where it reserves the Karasu and the Afrin River. It flows into the Mediterranean at its delta in Samandaƒü. There was a lake in the plain of Amik but this was drained in the 1970s, and today Amik is now the largest of the plains and an important agricultural center. The climate is typical of the Mediterranean, with warm wet winters and hot, dry summers. The mountain areas inland are drier than the coast. There are some mineral deposits, ƒ∞skenderun is home to Turkey's largest iron and steel plant, and the district of Yayladaƒüƒ± produces a colourful marble called Rose of Hatay. =Climate= Hatay has a Mediterranean climate which has very hot, long and dry summers with cool rainy winters. =Districts= Hatay province is divided into 12 districts: Altƒ±n√∂z√º, Antakya, Belen, D√∂rtyol, Erzin, Hassa, ƒ∞skenderun, Kƒ±rƒ±khan, Kumlu, Reyhanlƒ±, Samandaƒü and Yayladaƒüƒ±. In 2014, three more districts were created: Defne, Arsuz and Payas. Demography Late 20th - early 21st century language distribution. ‚Ä¢ Turkish ‚Ä¢ Arabic speakers are shown by religious affiliation: Alawite (circle), Christian (triangle), Sunni (square), Bedouin Sunni (rectangle), Jewish (rhombus). The majority of the population adheres to Islam, belonging to either the Alawi branch of Shia Islam or Sunni Islam, but other minorities are also present, including Syriac Orthodox, Syriac Catholic, Maronite, Antiochian Greek and Armenian communities. The village of Vakƒ±flƒ± in the district of Samandaƒü is Turkey's last remaining rural Armenian community.. Arabs form the majority in three districts out of the twelve: Samandaƒü (Suwaidiyyah) (Alawi), Altƒ±n√∂z√º (Qusair) and Reyhanlƒ± (Rihaniyyah) (Sunni). Unlike most Mediterranean provinces, Hatay has not experienced mass migration from other parts of Turkey in recent decades and has therefore preserved much of its traditional culture; for example, Arabic is still widely spoken in the province.Radikal-√ßevrimi√ßi / T√ºrkiye / Samandaƒü'da 'Allu≈ü'la dans To celebrate this cultural mix, in 2005 \\"Hatay Meeting of Civilisations\\" congress was organised by Dr Aydƒ±n Bozkurt of Mustafa Kemal University and his \\"Hatay Association for the Protection of Universal Values\\".Spiritual leaders speak up in Hatay for global peace ‚Äì Turkish Daily News Sep 27, 2005 During the Syrian Civil War, the province has experienced an influx of refugees. According to official figures, as of 21 April 2016, 408,000 Syrian refugees lived in the province. =Languages= Until annexation, Turkish and Arabic were both spoken, after Atat√ºrk's Reforms, however, the use of Arabic began to decline. Less than a generation ago, a child of an Arabic-speaking family would start school unable to speak Turkish; these days, most children of Arabic families start school unable to speak much, if any, Arabic. Some Arabic speakers will deny being \\"Arab,\\" a term that can be derogatory in Turkey. Turkey's policies on language have focused on imposing homogeneity. The degree of imposition peaked in 1983, when the military government introduced a law prohibiting (to varying degrees) languages other than Turkish. For speakers of some languages (those not using a first official language of a country recognized by Turkey), the law forbade the use of those languages, even during private conversation. (Rumpf, 1989) Although the law was repealed in 1991, the Constitution still prohibits any institution from teaching a language other than Turkish as a mother tongue (Article 42.9). This does not amount to a clear breach of any treaties which Turkey has signed, however some argue it impinges education rights in the European Convention of Human Rights (and its standard interpretation as its cornerstone rights from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights) to which Turkey is a party. As at 2016, 85% of Arabic-heritage-speaking people in relevant parts of Hatay, specifically those who hear and may use the language on a daily basis, believe it is decreasing; the rest disagree. The Arab Christian (Antiochian Greek Christians) minority has the right to teach Arabic under the Treaty of Lausanne, however they tend to refrain from doing so to avoid sectarian tensions as the treaty does not apply to the Muslim majority. Education Mustafa Kemal University is one of Turkey's newer tertiary institutions, founded in ƒ∞skenderun and Antakya in 1992. Transport The province is served by Hatay Airport, as well as inter-city buses. Culture =Cuisine= Hatay is warm enough to grow tropical crops such as sweet potato and sugar cane, and these are used in the local cuisine, along with other local specialities including a type of cucumber/squash called kitte. Well- known dishes of Hatay are its local variety of a widespread syrup-rich shredded pastry k√ºnefe (kanafeh), squash cooked in onions and tomato paste (sƒ±hƒ±lmahsi), aubergine and tahini paste (Baba ghanoush), chickpea and tahini paste hummus and dishes such as kebab found throughout Turkey. Particular spice mixes and herb mixes are popular. Pastes include: *walnut and spice paste, muhammara *thyme and parsley paste, Za'atar Animal products include spicy k√∂fte (across western Asia and beyond, kofta): \\"oruk\\"; and spicy sun- dried cheese, surke. Syrup of pomegranate (nar ek≈üisi) is Hatay's hallmark salad dressing. =Landmarks= * World's second-largest collection of Roman mosaics in the Hatay Archaeology Museum at Antakya. * Habib-i Najjar Mosque where two saints are buried and visited by Muslims. * Rock-carved Church of St Peter in Antakya, a site of Christian pilgrimage. * G√ºnd√ºz cinema, once parliament building of the Republic of Hatay. * Titus Tunnel of Vespasian, in Samandaƒüƒ±, built as a water channel in the 2nd century. * Castles: Koz Castle, Bakras Castle, Payas Castle, Mancƒ±nƒ±k Castle, Cin Castle, Darbƒ±sak Castle =Films= * Hatay is featured in the movie Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, where it was portrayed as the final resting place of the Holy Grail in the fictitious \\"Canyon of the Crescent Moon\\" outside of Alexandretta.

A supernormal stimulus or superstimulus is an exaggerated version of a stimulus to which there is an existing response tendency, or any stimulus that elicits a response more strongly than the stimulus for which it evolved. For example, when it comes to bird eggs, they can evolve to prefer the artificial versions to their own, particularly evident in brood parasitism, and humans can be similarly exploited by junk food and pornography. Organisms tend to show a preference for the stimulus properties (i.e. size, colour, etc.) that have evolved in nature; but when offered an artificial exaggerated stimulus, animals will show behaviour in favour of the artificial stimulus, over the naturally occurring stimulus. A variety of organisms that display or are susceptible to supernormal stimuli include insects, birds, and humans. Supernormal stimuli are present in areas of biology and psychology, but are also studied within other fields like sociology and art. British academic Nigel Spivey demonstrates the effect in the first episode of the 2005 BBC documentary series How Art Made the World to illustrate neuroscientist Vilayanur S. Ramachandran's speculation that this might be the reason for the grossly exaggerated body image demonstrated in works of art from the Venus of Willendorf right up to the present day.  Causation  Animals exhibiting, or responding to, characteristics that represent a supernormal stimulus usually display them as a result of selective pressures. Co-evolution between animals displaying supernormal stimuli, and the organisms responding to the supernormal stimuli, rely on evolution and propagation of genetics, behavioral patterns, and other biological factors. Supernormal stimuli such as emphasized color, size, patterns, or shapes, are often successful because an organism that exhibits them will often be selected by an organism that favors it. This will ensure survival and increased reproductive fitness of current and latter generations.  In biology  In the 1950s, Konrad Lorenz observed that birds would select brooding eggs that resembled those of their own species but which were larger. Niko Tinbergen, coined this term through his research, which discovered that experimenters could display an alternate target that attract an organism's attention more so than the naturally occurring target. Tinbergen studied herring gulls, and found the chicks peck at the red spot located on their parent's bill. The offspring targets the red spot due to the contrast of color (stimulus). They do this in order to receive food through regurgitation from the parent. Tinbergen and colleagues developed an experiment that presented different models to chicks and determined their pecking rates. They used different models including an adult herring gull's natural head, a standard wooden model of its head, the bill only, and a red stick with smaller white markings on it. The pecking rate of the chicks were consistent with the natural head, standard head model, and the bill only model. The pecking rate of the chicks increased when presented with the stick model. This suggests that the chicks preferred the dramatic contrast of the red stick with the yellow markings, therefore the artificial stimulus of the stick model was favored over the basic herring gull head and bill models, proving that the artificial stimuli was favored over the naturally occurring stimuli. Following his extensive analysis of the stimulus features that elicited food-begging in the chick of the herring gull, constructed an artificial stimulus consisting of a red knitting needle with three white bands painted around it; this elicited a stronger response than an accurate three-dimensional model of the parent's head (white) and bill (yellow with a red spot). Tinbergen and his students studied other variations of this effect. He experimented with dummy plaster eggs of various sizes and markings finding that most birds preferred ones with more exaggerated markings than their own, more saturated versions of their color, and a larger size than their own. Small songbirds which laid light blue grey-dappled eggs preferred to sit on a bright blue black polka- dotted dummy so large they slid off repeatedly. Territorial male stickleback fish would attack wooden floats with red undersides‚Äîattacking them more vigorously than invading male sticklebacks if the underside were redder. Lorenz and Tinbergen accounted for the supernormal stimulus effect in terms of the concept of the innate releasing mechanism; however this concept is no longer widely used. The core observation that simple features of stimuli may be sufficient to trigger a complex response remains valid, however. In 1979, the term supernormal stimulus was used by Richard Dawkins and John Krebs to refer to the exaggeration of pre-existing signs induced by social parasites, noting the manipulation of baby birds (hosts) from these, to illustrate the effectiveness of those signals.Dawkins R, Krebs JR (1979). Arms between and within species. Proc R Soc Lond B Biol Sci 205:489-511 In 1983, entomologists Darryl Gwynne and David Rentz reported on the beetle Julodimorpha bakewelli attempting to copulate with discarded brown stubbies (a type of beer bottles) studded with tubercules (flattened glass beads). This work won them the 2011 Ig Nobel Prize in biology. Another example of this is the study made by Mauck and colleagues, where they evaluated the effects of a plant pathogen named cucumber mosaic virus or CMV. This study showed that the aphids preferred the healthy plants but are still attracted by the infected plants, because of the manipulation of volatile compounds used by plants to attract them.Mauck E, De Moraes C and Mescher M. 2010. Deceptive chemical signals induced by a plant virus attract insects vectors to inferior hosts. PNAS Vol. 107. No 8. 3603. = Insects = Pollinators, like butterflies, show behavioral response(s) to supernormal stimuli through intersexual communication. Butterflies use olfactory cues, but primarily rely on visual forms of communication, due to wind and temperature affecting their sense of smell. Sexually active butterflies will perch and wait for a mate. Once an object is detected, the butterfly can determine if the color and movement patterns are of a sexually receptive butterfly. In certain species, like the silver-washed fritillary butterfly (Argynnis paphia), the male butterfly will exhibit high contrast sensitivity and well-developed visual acuity. A more dramatic contrast of color (or movement pattern) resembling, but further emphasizing the traits of the female butterfly, could alter this usual behavior in males. Studies show that the male silver-washed fritillary butterfly select a monochromatic orange paper model, over receptive female butterflies who portrayed their usual coloration/markings. = Manipulation by parasites = In 2001, Holen et al., analyzed the evolutionary stability of hosts manipulation through exaggerated signals. Their model indicated that intensity of parasitic signals must be below a threshold to ensure acceptance from host. This threshold depends directly on the range of parasitism.√íistein HH, Glenn-Peter S, Tore S and Nils C. Parasites and supernormal manipulation. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B 268, 2551-2558 Supernormal stimuli can be exhibited by brood parasites, for example, the parasitic cuckoo chick and parental care by reed warblers. Brood parasites have evolved more dramatic colors, sizes, patterns, and/or shapes that lead to the parasite being interpreted as healthier or more preferable, in contrast to neighboring offspring. Cuckoo chicks are often successful because their begging calls, the supernormal stimulus, are representative of an entire reed warbler brood. Due to the host parent's evolutionary instinct, elicited by selective pressures, they will select this exaggerated form of the stimulus. These calls will cause the host parent to primarily invest energy into the parasitic chick and provide it with additional food resources. Studies show that the supernormal stimuli in cuckoo chicks alter the foraging behavior in parental reed warblers. For them, the only evolutionary stable strategy is when the host accepts all signs of the parasite with optimal intensity, which must be below the threshold; if this is not the case, the host can use these signals to identify the parasite.  Maladaptive behavior  Maladaptive behaviors are shown by organisms that display a preference for supernormal stimuli over naturally occurring stimuli. This is often based on instinct to gather as many resources as possible in a resource-sparse environment. It can also be instinctual for certain species to select the supernormal stimuli that will suggest the best energy investment of the individual, often parental investment. The selection of the supernormal stimuli must also simultaneously outweigh the cost of the behavior in order for it to evolve. This is shown in the cuckoo chick and the effects on host reed warblers. These parasitic chicks exhibit irresistible begging calls toward the parental host. This occurs as a result of selective pressures. The reed warbler increases foraging efforts to feed the parasitic chick and its own offspring. As a result, this shows a maladaptive behaviour of the host reed warbler as it is investing into a chick that is not biologically related, which does not provide reproductive fitness gain.  Biodiversity concerns  The significance of supernormal stimuli and brood parasitism or in various other species susceptible to environmental manipulation, is that this can drastically reduce the population numbers of the respective species. Brood parasitism can cause host parents to ignore their own offspring or display a higher parental investment into the parasite. Animals that are at risk of extinction, extirpation, or vulnerability will be impacted by supernormal stimuli present in brood parasites.  In psychology  Harvard psychologist Deirdre Barrett argues that supernormal stimulation governs the behavior of humans as powerfully as that of other animals. In her 2010 book, Supernormal Stimuli: How Primal Urges Overran Their Evolutionary Purpose, she examines the impact of supernormal stimuli on the diversion of impulses for nurturing, sexuality, romance, territoriality, defense, and the entertainment industry's hijacking of our social instincts. In her earlier book Waistland, she explains junk food as an exaggerated stimulus to cravings for salt, sugar, and fats and television as an exaggeration of social cues of laughter, smiling faces and attention-grabbing action. Modern artifacts may activate instinctive responses which evolved prior to the modern world, where breast development was a sign of health and fertility in a prospective mate, and fat was a rare and vital nutrient. In a cross-cultural study, Doyle and Pazhoohi showed that surgically augmented breasts are supernormal stimuli, and they are more attractive than natural breasts, regardless of their size. Also in a theoretical paper, Doyle proposed that how women walk creates supernormal stimuli through continuously alternating motion of the waist and hips causing peak shifts in perceptions of physical attractiveness involving women's waist-to-hip ratio (WHR). Furthermore, Pazhoohi et al. (2019) using eye tracking confirmed that lower than optimal WHRs are supernormal stimuli and they may generate peak shifts in responding.  In art  Costa and Corazza (2006), examining 776 artistic portraits covering the whole history of art, showed that eye roundness, lip roundness, eye height, eye width, and lip height were significantly enhanced in artistic portraits compared to photographic ones matched for sex and age. In a second study, forty-two art academy students were requested to draw two self-portraits, one with a mirror and one without (from memory). Eye and lip size and roundness were greater in artistic self-portraits. These results show that the exaggeration and \\"supernormalization\\" of key features linked to attractiveness, such as eye and lip size, are frequently found in art. Pazhoohi et al. (2019) showed that classic contrapposto pose is considered more attractive and provided evidence and insight as to why, in artistic presentation, goddesses of beauty and love are often depicted in contrapposto pose.

He was the recipient of many fashion awards, including seven Coty Awards and the Fashion Institute of Technology's Lifetime Achievement Award (1999). Early life Blass was born in Fort Wayne, Indiana, the son of Ralph Aldrich Blass, a traveling hardware salesman, and his wife, Ethyl Keyser Blass. In his autobiography, Blass wrote that the margins in his school books were filled with sketches of Hollywood-inspired fashions instead of notes. At fifteen, he began sewing and selling evening gowns for $25 each to a New York manufacturer. At seventeen he had saved enough money to move to Manhattan and study fashion. At eighteen, he was the first male to win Mademoiselle's Design for Living award. He spent his salary of $30 a week on clothing, shoes and elegant meals. In 1943, Blass enlisted in the Army. Due to his intelligence and talent, he was assigned to the 603rd Camouflage Battalion. Its mission was to decieve the German Army into believing the Allies were positioned in fake locations, for example by using dummy tanks. He served in this unit at several major operations including the Battle of the Bulge, and the Rhine River crossing. Fashion career Blass began his New York fashion career in 1945. He was a prot√©g√© of Baron de Gunzburg. In 1970, after two decades of success in menswear and womenswear, he bought Maurice Rentner Ltd., which he had joined in 1959, and renamed it Bill Blass Limited. Over the next 30 years he expanded his line to include swimwear, furs, luggage, perfume, and chocolate. In 1967, he was the first American couture fashion designer to start a men‚Äôs wear line. That part of his business grew to offer everything from ties, socks and belts to suits and evening clothes. It was made by 18 licensees. Like many designers, his women‚Äôs couture collections lost money but served to promote other parts of his business. By the mid-1990s, his ready to wear business grossed about $9 million annually and his 97 licensing agreements had retail sales of more than $700 million a year. His clients, many of whom were also his friends, included Happy Rockefeller, Brooke Astor, Nancy Kissinger, Jessye Norman, Gloria Vanderbilt and Patricia Buckley. =The Bill Blass Edition Continental Mark series= Beginning in 1976, and continuing until 1992, Blass lent his talents to the Ford Motor Company for an edition of their Continental Mark series of automobiles. In 1976, he shared model configurations with Emilio Pucci, Hubert de Givenchy, and Cartier. Each year, as goes true fashion, the interior and exterior color combinations would be updated. One of the most popular was the 1979 edition honoring a nautical theme, as did the Blass logo of the time. Small anchors were incorporated into the exterior accent striping and interior accents within the Blass \\"back-to-back B\\" design theme. The 1979 through 1983 Mark series Blass models were available with a \\"carriage roof\\" giving a convertible top look to the cars. After 1983, the Bill Blass edition became a color option with rear quarter window model designations and a few features that were options on the standard model.  Awards and Recognition  Over the years, Blass won three Coty American Fashion Critics Awards. He won the 1968 Coty for men‚Äôs wear. The Council of Fashion Designers of American awarded Blass their Lifetime Achievement Award in 1987 and was the group‚Äôs first winner of their Humanitarian Leadership Award in 1996. He was also named to the International Best Dressed List Hall of Fame List. New York Public Library In 1994, Blass gave $10 million to the New York Public Library. In recognition of the gift, the Public Catalog Room of the New York Public Library Main Branch at Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street was named the Bill Blass Public Catalogue Room. Retirement and death In 1999, Blass sold Bill Blass Limited for $50 million to Michael Groveman and retired to his home in New Preston, Connecticut. Blass was diagnosed with oral/tongue cancer in 2000, not long after he began writing his memoir.Bare Blass book review from Look Online. His cancer later developed into throat cancer, resulting in his death on June 12, 2002, ten days away from his 80th birthday. Blass collected art and was a connoisseur of antiquities and in his will bequeathed half of his $52 million estate, as well as several important ancient sculptures, to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

They had a diving depth of .Friedman, p. 306 For surface running, the boats were powered by two NELSECO diesel engines, each driving one propeller shaft. When submerged each propeller was driven by a electric motor. They could reach on the surface and underwater. On the surface, the boats had a range of at and at submerged.Gardiner & Gray, p. 127 The F-class submarines were armed with four 18 inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes in the bow, no reloads were carried. Construction and career The boat was named Barracuda when she was laid down by Union Iron Works of San Francisco, California, but was renamed on 17 November 1911. She was launched on 19 March 1912 sponsored by Miss A. R. Rolph, daughter of James Rolph, the mayor of San Francisco, and commissioned on 25 June 1912 with Lieutenant (junior grade) Francis T. Chew in command. F-2 joined the 1st Submarine Group, Pacific Torpedo Flotilla, in operations between San Diego, California, and San Pedro, California, the Flotilla's base. She continued to play an important part in developing tactics and coordinating the use of undersea craft with the fleet during an extended training period in the Hawaiian Islands from August 1914-November 1915. After lying in ordinary at Mare Island Naval Shipyard from 16 March 1916 ‚Äì 13 June 1917, F-2 became flagship of Division 1, Submarine Force, Pacific Fleet. Returning to operations out of San Pedro, she participated in surface and submerged exercises, torpedo-proving practice, experiments in balancing at various depths, and trained prospective crews of new submarines. On 18 September 1919, she was placed in reserve commission at San Pedro to be used in elemental school work until decommissioned at Mare Island on 16 March 1922. She was sold on 17 August.

Her keel was laid down at Portsmouth Navy Yard. She was launched as V-1 (SF-4) on 17 July 1924, sponsored by Mrs. Cornelia Wolcott Snyder, wife of Captain Snyder, and commissioned on 1 October 1924 with Lieutenant Commander Sherwood Picking in command. V-1 and her sisters V-2 (Bass) and V-3 (Bonita) were the only class of the nine \\"V-boats\\" designed to meet the fleet submarine requirement of surface speed for operating with contemporary battleships.  Engineering  V-1 was completed with two Busch- Sulzer direct-drive 6-cylinder 2-cycle main diesel engines of each, along with two Busch-Sulzer auxiliary diesel engines of each, driving electrical generators. The latter were primarily for charging batteries, but to reach maximum surfaced speed, they could augment the mechanically coupled main- propulsion engines by driving the 1,200 hp (890 kW) electric motors in parallel via an electric transmission. Although it wasn't until about 1939 that its problems were solved, electric transmission in a pure diesel-electric arrangement became the propulsion system for the successful fleet submarines of World War II, the Tambor-class through the Tench-class. Prior to recommissioning in 1940, the auxiliary diesels were replaced with two BuEng Maschinenfabrik Augsburg N√ºrnberg AG (MAN-designed) 6-cylinder 4-cycle diesel engines of each. In 1942-43 Barracuda was converted to a cargo submarine, with the main engines removed to provide cargo space, significantly reducing her speed on the remaining auxiliary diesels.  Construction  V-1 had been commissioned in 1924 for surface running only, to permit an early trial of her engines. She was assigned to Submarine Division 20 and, after cruising along the New England coast, sailed on 14 January 1925 on a surface cruise of the Caribbean Sea, returning in May 1925 for completion. V-1 cruised along the Atlantic coast and in the Caribbean until November 1927.  Operational life  On 8 November 1927 Squadron 20 left Portsmouth, New Hampshire, for San Diego, California, arriving 3 December. Between December 1927 and May 1932 V-1 served with the Squadron on routine operations with the fleet along the west coast, in the Hawaiian Islands, and in the Caribbean. During this period her 5 inch (127 mm)/51 caliber deck gun was replaced by a 3 inch (76 mm)/50 caliber weapon.Gardiner and Chesneau, pp. 141-142 Her name was changed to Barracuda 9 March 1931 (for the scrapped F-2) and her hull classification symbol to SS-163, 1 July 1931. In May 1932 she went into Rotating Reserve with Submarine Division 15 at Mare Island Naval Shipyard. In January 1933 Barracuda was assigned to Submarine Division 12 and, until late in 1936, operated along the west coast and cruised to Pearl Harbor and the Panama Canal Zone with the fleet. On 28 October 1936 she left San Diego for the Caribbean where she took part in the Gravimetric Survey Expedition. On 8 January 1937 Barracuda sailed from St. Thomas, Virgin Islands, and arrived at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 14 January, where she remained until placed out of commission 14 May 1937.  Recommissioning  Barracuda was recommissioned at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on 5 September 1940 and assigned to Submarine Division 9. She sailed from Portsmouth 2 March 1941 to Bermuda, returning in June to join Submarine Division 71. She remained in the New England area until sailing from New London, Connecticut, on 17 November 1941 to join the Pacific Fleet. She attended to duty in the Pacific Patrol Area until 15 December 1941 when she rejoined the Atlantic Fleet. Between 15 December 1941 and 7 September 1942 Barracuda was attached to Submarine Division 31 and completed six war patrols in the Pacific Ocean, southwest of Panama, without enemy contacts. Barracuda returned to Coco Solo, Canal Zone, on 7 September 1942 and, following voyage repairs, she proceeded to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for overhaul. At this time she was converted to a cargo submarine with the removal of her main engines, severely restricting her speed on the auxiliary engines.U.S. Submarines Through 1945 p. 114 Following overhaul she was based at New London until February 1945 with Submarine Divisions 13 and 31. She operated on training problems with destroyers, other submarines, and planes in Block Island Sound. Barracuda arrived at Philadelphia Navy Yard on 16 February 1945; was decommissioned 3 March 1945; and sold 16 November 1945.

Retrieved 5 February 2008 The three SSK boats, Barracuda (SSK-1), Bass (SSK-2), and Bonita (SSK-3), were equipped with the large BQR-4 bow-mounted sonar array as part of Project Kayo, which experimented with the use of passive acoustics via low-frequency bow-mounted sonar arrays. When the boat was rigged for silent running, these arrays gave greatly improved convergence zone detection ranges against snorkeling submarines. The SSKs themselves were limited in their anti-submarine warfare capabilities by their low speed and their need to snorkel periodically, but the advances in sonar technology they pioneered were invaluable to later nuclear-powered submarines. The class was developed as mobilization prototypes should large numbers of Soviet submarines based on the Type XXI U-boat appear. Barracuda joined Submarine Development Group 2, which was stationed at her home port of New London, Connecticut. She cruised along the Atlantic coast of the United States and Canada, in the Caribbean Sea, and made a voyage to Greenock and Rothesay, Scotland, in June 1955. On 15 December 1955 her name was changed from K-1 to Barracuda (SSK-1). During intervals between and after these cruises, Barracuda operated along the eastern seaboard carrying out training and experimental exercises. Redesignation and service as training submarine In 1958, the Soviet threat changed from conventional to nuclear-powered submarines, and the SSK force was withdrawn from the SSK role and redesignated. Barracuda was redesignated SST-3 on 15 July 1959 and operated for the next several years out of Charleston, South Carolina and Key West, Florida. Barracuda was overhauled from 1963 to 1964 at Norfolk, Virginia. Her distinctive forward sonar array was removed and replaced with a streamlined bow at the submarine base in Key West Florida alongside USS Bushnell - similar to submarines converted to GUPPY configurations. In 1965 she conducted training operations out of Key West, Florida. In 1968 she was transferred to Charleston, South Carolina and served as a training platform for junior officers and enlisted personnel. On 1 August 1972 she was redesignated as SS-T3.DANFS entry for Barracuda Although, based on redesignation of her sisters as SS-551 and SS-552, the hull number SS-550 was probably reserved for her, she never officially held this designation.

He ruled from 1374 to 1375. Leo was described as \\"Leo V, King of Armenia\\" on his own personal seal (),Mutafian, p.90 and as \\"Leo of Lusignan the Fifth\\" in the Middle French inscription on his cenotaph: .Full text of the cenotaph with translation hereunder. Family and early life Leo was the son of John constable of Armenia, Constable and Regent of Armenia. According to the contemporary chronicler Jean Dardel, Leo's mother, Soldane, was the daughter of a Georgian king. Soldane is otherwise unknown from the medieval sources, and scholars such as R√ºdt-Collenberg have cast doubt on the credibility of Dardel's genealogy. Surviving documentary evidence suggests that Jean de Lusignan never married Leo's mother and she was, rather, his concubine. Constantine V, in order to wipe out all claimants to the throne, had given orders to kill Leo and his brother Bohemond, but they escaped to Cyprus before the murder could be carried out. He was made a Knight of the Chivalric Order of the Sword in 1360 and Titular Seneschal of Jerusalem on October 17, 1372. King of Armenia Leo was elected to the throne on the death of his distant cousin Constantine VI of Armenia in 1373. After a short regency by Mary of Korykos, widow of Constantine, Leo left Famagusta in spite of the ongoing conflict between Cyprus and Genoa. Landing at Korykos, he managed with difficulty to reach Sis, which was already being besieged by the Muslim emir of Aleppo.Mutafian, p.89 Leo and his wife, whom he married at Cyprus in May 1369, Marguerite of Soissons, daughter of Jean de Soissons and wife, were crowned at Sis on July 26 or September 14, 1374, according to both the Latin and Armenia rites. His right to the throne was challenged by Ashot and Leo's short reign was marked by numerous disputes between the various factions. After several battles against superior Mamluk forces, he locked himself in the fortress at Geben (Armeina: Gaban) and eventually surrendered in 1375, thus putting an end to the last Armenian state until the establishment of the short lived Democratic Republic of Armenia (1918‚Äì1920) and the Republic of Armenia in 1991. The Mameluks took Leo to Cairo with his family, where he was placed under surveillance for several years.Mutafian, Leon V In August 1377, he met with Jean Dardel, a Franciscan who was on his way for a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. Leon befriended him and employed him as his secretary. Dardel returned to Europe to plead the case of Leon V, and managed to convince King John I of Castile to pay a ransom of precious stones, silks, and birds of prey in 1382. His wife had died in Cairo, between 1379 and July 4, 1381. Life in Europe Leon de Lusignan arrived ill and poor to Medina del Campo. In 1382 or 1383, the King of Castile named Leon Lord of Madrid.Un Madrid ins√≥lito: Gu√≠a para dejarse sorprender, pg. 39‚Äì40. Jes√∫s Callejo. Editorial Complutense, 2001. . The book, however, talks about Leon V of Armenia since Leo I of Armenia isn't counted as a King by some authors. John I granted him for life the town of Madrid, And√∫jar, Guadalajara and Villareal (today Ciudad Real) and a yearly gift of 150,000 maravedis.http://www.dupalu.com/2015/03/sabias-que-madrid-fue-durante-8-anos- un.html?m=1 Leon rebuilt the towers of the Royal Alc√°zar. According to father Juan de Mariana, Leon left Castile for France after the death of his protector in 1390. Federico Bravo, however, states that he left after two years of ruling, and five years later, the Madrilenians were conceded the revocation of the lordship by John. Leon V apparently went to Paris in June 1384, and received the Saint-Ouen castle and a sizable pension from King Charles VI of France. He attempted to reconcile the French and the English (at the time fighting the Hundred Years' War) in order to set up a new Crusade and obtain help to recover his lands, but the meeting he organized in 1386 between Boulogne and Calais were unsuccessful. Leon continued his diplomatic mission to England in 1389 and in 1392. Death Original tomb of Leon V, in the Couvent des C√©lestins, Paris. Leon V never recovered his throne, and died in Paris on November 29, 1393. His remains were laid to rest in the Couvent des C√©lestins, near Place de la Bastille in Paris, the second most important burial site for royalty after Saint-Denis. The prestigious convent was located nearby Leon's residence of H√¥tel des Tournelles, itself near H√¥tel Saint-Pol, the favourite residence of Charles V and Charles VI in the area of Le Marais. Leon received lavish funerals and had a lavish tomb, located in the choir of the church. However, the convent was profanated during the French Revolution. After the revolution, his tombstone was recovered by Alexandre Lenoir who placed it in his Mus√©e des monuments Fran√ßais in the Saint-Denis Basilica. In 1815, during the Restoration, a new cenotaph was established for Leon V at the royal Saint Denis Basilica where most representatives of the French monarchy lie. The effigy on the tombstone, by an anonymous artist, is of a high realism and quality, and it is thought that it was made while Leon was still alive. Leon V is depicted holding a scepter (now broken) and gloves, symbol of great princes.

One of Turkey's most prominent novelists, his work has sold over thirteen million books in sixty-three languages, making him the country's best-selling writer. Pamuk is the author of novels including Silent House, The White Castle, The Black Book, The New Life, My Name Is Red, Snow, The Museum of Innocence, A Strangeness in My Mind, and The Red-Haired Woman. He is the Robert Yik-Fong Tam Professor in the Humanities at Columbia University, where he teaches writing and comparative literature.

He is also the recipient of numerous other literary awards. My Name Is Red won the 2002 Prix du Meilleur Livre √âtranger, 2002 Premio Grinzane Cavour and 2003 International Dublin Literary Award. The European Writers' Parliament came about as a result of a joint proposal by Pamuk and Jos√© Saramago. In 2005, the ultra-nationalist lawyer Kemal Kerin√ßsiz sued Pamuk over his statement regarding the Armenian Genocide in the Ottoman Empire. His intention, according to Pamuk himself, had been to highlight issues relating to freedom of speech in the country of his birth. The court initially declined to hear the case, but in 2011 Pamuk was ordered to pay 6,000 liras in total compensation for having insulted the plaintiffs' honor. Early life Pamuk was born in Istanbul, in 1952, and he grew up in a wealthy yet declining upper-class family; an experience he describes in passing in his novels The Black Book and Cevdet Bey and His Sons, as well as more thoroughly in his personal memoir Istanbul: Memories and the City. Pamuk's paternal grandmother was Circassian.Pamuk, Orhan (2005). Istanbul: Memories and the City, translated by Maureen Freely. Faber & Faber. p. 15. \\"My paternal grandmother was Circassian (Circassian girls, famous for being tall and beautiful, were very popular in Ottoman harems).\\" He was educated at Robert College secondary school in Istanbul and went on to study architecture at the Istanbul Technical University since it was related to his real dream career, painting. He left the architecture school after three years, however, to become a full-time writer, and graduated from the Institute of Journalism at the University of Istanbul in 1976. From ages 22 to 30, Pamuk lived with his mother, writing his first novel and attempting to find a publisher. He describes himself as a Cultural Muslim who associates the historical and cultural identification with the religion while not believing in a personal connection to God. Work Turkish Angora cat at his personal writing space He started writing regularly in 1974. His first novel, Karanlƒ±k ve I≈üƒ±k (Darkness and Light) was a co-winner of the 1979 Milliyet Press Novel Contest (Mehmet Eroƒülu was the other winner). This novel was published with the title Cevdet Bey ve Oƒüullarƒ± (Mr. Cevdet and His Sons) in 1982, and won the Orhan Kemal Novel Prize in 1983. It tells the story of three generations of a wealthy Istanbul family living in Ni≈üanta≈üƒ±, the district of Istanbul where Pamuk grew up. Pamuk won a number of critical prizes for his early work, including the 1984 Madarali Novel Prize for his second novel Sessiz Ev (Silent House) and the 1991 Prix de la D√©couverte Europ√©enne for the French translation of this novel. His historical novel Beyaz Kale (The White Castle), published in Turkish in 1985, won the 1990 Independent Award for Foreign Fiction and extended his reputation abroad. On 19 May 1991, The New York Times Book Review stated, \\"A new star has risen in the east‚ÄîOrhan Pamuk.\\" He started experimenting with postmodern techniques in his novels, a change from the strict naturalism of his early works. Popular success took a bit longer to come to Pamuk, but his 1990 novel Kara Kitap (The Black Book) became one of the most controversial and popular books in Turkish literature, due to its complexity and richness. In 1992, he wrote the screenplay for the movie Gizli Y√ºz (Secret Face), based on Kara Kitap and directed by a prominent Turkish director, √ñmer Kavur. Pamuk's fifth novel Yeni Hayat (New Life) caused a sensation in Turkey upon its 1994 publication and became the fastest-selling book in Turkish history. By this time, Pamuk had also become a high-profile figure in Turkey, due to his support for Kurdish political rights. In 1995, Pamuk was among a group of authors tried for writing essays that criticized Turkey's treatment of the Kurds. In 1999, Pamuk published his book of essays √ñteki Renkler (Other Colors). In 2019, the 66-year-old Nobel Laureate held an exhibit spotlighting an array of photos of Istanbul taken from his own balcony, named \\"Balkon: Photos by Orhan Pamuk\\". The exhibition consists of pictures of \\"subtle and ever-changing view of Istanbul\\" taken by Pamuk from his balcony in late 2012 and early 2013, said Yapƒ± Kredi Culture and Arts Publishing. Curated by Gerhard Steidl, the German publisher of his photo book Balkon, the exhibit runs through 27 April at the Yapƒ± Kredi Culture and Arts building on Istanbul's teeming Istiklal Street. The exhibit features more than 600 photos selected from over 8,500 taken by Pamuk using a telephoto lens over a five- month period, \\"a period of intense creativity,\\" according to the statement. =My Name Is Red= Pamuk's international reputation continued to increase when he published Benim Adƒ±m Kƒ±rmƒ±zƒ± (My Name is Red) in 1998. The novel blends mystery, romance, and philosophical puzzles in a setting of 16th century Istanbul. It opens a window into the reign of Ottoman Sultan Murat III in nine snowy winter days of 1591, inviting the reader to experience the tension between East and West from a breathlessly urgent perspective. My Name Is Red has been translated into 24 languages and in 2003 won the International Dublin Literary Award, the world's most lucrative literary prize. Asked what impact winning this last award (currently $127,000) had on his life and work, Pamuk replied: > Nothing changed in my life since I work all the time. I've spent 30 years > writing fiction. For the first 10 years, I worried about money and no one > asked how much money I made. The second decade I spent money and no one was > asking about that. And I've spent the last 10 years with everyone expecting > to hear how I spend the money, which I will not do. =Snow= Pamuk followed this with the novel Kar, published in 2002 (English translation: Snow, 2004). Set in the border city of Kars, it explores the conflict between Islamism and Westernism in modern Turkey. Snow follows Ka, an expatriate Turkish poet, as he wanders around the snowy Kars and gets caught up in the muddle of aimless Islamists, MPs, headscarf advocates, secularists, and a number of factions who die and kill in the name of highly contradictory ideals. The New York Times listed Snow as one of its Ten Best Books of 2004. In conversation with Carol Becker in the Brooklyn Rail about creating sympathetic characters in the political novel, Pamuk said: > I strongly feel that the art of the novel is based on the human capacity, > though it‚Äôs a limited capacity, to be able to identify with \\"the other\\". > Only human beings can do this. It requires imagination, a sort of morality, > a self-imposed goal of understanding this person who is different from us, > which is a rarity. =The Museum of Innocence= In May 2007, Pamuk was among the jury members at the Cannes Film Festival headed by British director Stephen Frears. He completed his next novel, Masumiyet M√ºzesi (The Museum of Innocence) in the summer of 2008 - the first novel he published after receiving the 2006 Nobel Prize in Literature. Pamuk created an actual Museum of Innocence, consisting of everyday objects tied to the narrative, and housed them at an Istanbul house he purchased. Pamuk collaborated on a documentary \\"The Innocence of Memories\\" that expanded on his Museum of Innocence. Pamuk stated that \\"(Museum of Dreams will) tell a different version of the love story set in Istanbul through objects and Grant Gee‚Äôs wonderful new film\\". In both Snow and the Museum of Innocence Pamuk describes tragic love-stories, where men fall in love with beautiful women at first sight. It has been noted that Pamuk's portrayals of women and the reasons men fall in love with them are powerful in their intensity, yet superficial in the way these love stories originate. Pamuk's heroes tend to be educated men who fall tragically in love with beauties, but who seem doomed to a decrepit loneliness. In 2013, Pamuk invited Grazia Toderi, whose work he admired, to design a work for the Museum of Innocence in Istanbul. Their collaboration culminated in the exhibition Words and Stars. Words and Stars opened on 2 April 2017, at the MART (Museo di Arte Moderna e Contemporanea di Trento e Rovereto), and which explores \\"the inclination of man to explore space and innate vocation to question the stars.\\" The show was curated by Gianfranco Maraniello.\\"Grazia Toderi & Orhan Pamuk: Words and Stars,\\" by My Art Guides, accessed 6 April 2017, http://myartguides.com/exhibitions/grazia-toderi-orhan-pamuk-words-and-stars/ It also showed from 4 November 2016 to 29 March 2017 from 5‚Äì6 November 2016 at the Palazzo Madama, Piazza Castello, Turin, and at Infini-to, the Planetarium of Turin (Infini.to - Planetario di Torino, Museo dell'Astronomia e dello Spazio) by invitation.\\"WORDS AND STARS. Grazia Toderi e Orhan Pamuk,\\" Palazzo Madama, accessed 6 April 2017, http://www.palazzomadamatorino.it/en/eventi-e- mostre/words-and-stars-grazia-toderi-e-orhan-pamuk =The Red-Haired Woman= Pamuk's tenth novel, The Red-Haired Woman (2016) is the story of a well-digger and his apprentice looking for water on barren land. It is also a novel of ideas in the tradition of the French conte philosophique. In mid-1980s Istanbul, Master Mahmut and his apprentice use ancient methods to dig new wells; this is the tale of their back-breaking struggle, but it is also an exploration‚Äîthrough stories and images‚Äîof ideas about fathers and sons, authoritarianism and individuality, state and freedom, reading and seeing. This short, compelling novel is at once a realist text investigating a murder which took place thirty years ago near Istanbul, and a fictional inquiry into the literary foundations of civilizations, comparing two fundamental myths of the West and the East respectively: Sophocles's Oedipus Rex (a story of patricide) and Ferdowsi's tale of Rostam and Sohrab (a story of filicide). Throughout runs the demonic voice of the eponymous red-haired woman. =Non- fiction= Pamuk published a memoir/travelogue Istanbul‚ÄîHatƒ±ralar ve ≈ûehir in 2003 (English version, Istanbul‚ÄîMemories and the City, 2005). Pamuk's Other Colours ‚Äì a collection of non-fiction and a story ‚Äî was published in the UK in September 2007. Asked how personal his book Istanbul: Memories and the City was, Pamuk replied: > I thought I would write Memories and the City in six months, but it took me > one year to complete. And I was working twelve hours a day, just reading and > working. My life, because of so many things, was in a crisis; I don‚Äôt want > to go into those details: divorce, father dying, professional problems, > problems with this, problems with that, everything was bad. I thought if I > were to be weak I would have a depression. But every day I would wake up and > have a cold shower and sit down and remember and write, always paying > attention to the beauty of the book. Honestly, I may have hurt my mother, my > family. My father was dead, but my mother is still alive. But I can‚Äôt care > about that; I must care about the beauty of the book. Style Pamuk's books are characterized by a confusion or loss of identity brought on in part by the conflict between Western and Eastern values. They are often disturbing or unsettling, and include complex plots and characters. His works are also redolent with discussion of and fascination with the creative arts, such as literature and painting. Pamuk's work often touches on the deep-rooted tensions between East and West and tradition and modernism/secularism. Pamuk speaks about \\"the angel of inspiration\\" when he discusses his creativity: > \\"I am just listening to an inner music, the mystery of which I don't > completely know. And I don't want to know.\\" \\"I am most surprised by those > moments when I have felt as if the sentences, dreams, and pages that have > made me so ecstatically happy have not come from my own imagination ‚Äì that > another power has found them and generously presented them to me.\\" A group of writers assert that some parts of Pamuk's works are heavily influenced by works of other writers, and some chapters are almost totally quoted from other books. Pamuk himself said that his works have been inspired by the writings of rebel poet Kazi Nazrul Islam. One of the writers, nationalist popular-historian Murat Bardak√ßƒ±, accused him of counterfeiting and plagiarism in the Hurriyet, a Turkish newspaper. Another accusation is that Pamuk's novel The White Castle contains exact paragraphs from Fuad Carim's Kanuni Devrinde ƒ∞stanbul (\\"Istanbul in the Time of the Kanuni\\") novel. After a question raised at the 2009 Boston Book Festival as to whether he wanted to respond to these accusations, Pamuk responded, \\"No I do not. Next question?\\". However, many attributed such accusations to their ignorance about postmodern literature, and the literary technique of intertextuality which Pamuk almost always uses in his novels in full disclosure. Personal life Pamuk's elder brother ≈ûevket Pamuk, who sometimes appears as a fictional character in Orhan Pamuk's works, is a professor of economics, internationally recognised for his work in history of economics of the Ottoman Empire, working at Boƒüazi√ßi University in Istanbul. Pamuk also has a younger half-sister H√ºmeyra Pamuk, who is a journalist. On 1 March 1982, Pamuk married historian Aylin T√ºreg√ºn. From 1985 to 1988, while his wife was a graduate student at Columbia University, Pamuk assumed the position of visiting scholar there, using the time to conduct research and write his novel The Black Book at the university's Butler Library. This period also included a visiting fellowship at the University of Iowa. Pamuk returned to Istanbul, a city to which he is strongly attached. He and his wife had a daughter named R√ºya (born 1991), whose name means \\"dream\\" in Turkish. In 2001, they were divorced. In 2006, Pamuk returned to the U.S. to take a position as a visiting professor at Columbia, where he was a Fellow with Columbia's Committee on Global Thought and held an appointment in Columbia's Middle East and Asian Languages and Cultures department and at its School of the Arts. In the 2007‚Äì2008 academic year Pamuk returned to Columbia to jointly teach comparative literature classes with Andreas Huyssen and David Damrosch. Pamuk was also a writer-in- residence at Bard College. In autumn 2009, Pamuk was Harvard's Charles Eliot Norton Lecturer, delivering a series of lectures entitled \\"The Naive and Sentimental Novelist\\". Orhan publicly acknowledged his relationship with Kiran Desai, Booker prize winner of Indian origin.http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Pamuk-Its-no-secret-Kiran-is- my-girlfriend/articleshow/5522050.cms In January 2011, Turkish-Armenian artist Karolin Fi≈üek√ßi told H√ºrriyet Daily News that Pamuk had a two-and-a-half-year relationship with her during the same time (2010‚Äì12), a statement expressly denied by Pamuk. Since 2011 he's in a relationship with Aslƒ± Akyava≈ü. Trial In 2005, after Pamuk made a statement regarding the Armenian Genocide and mass killings of Kurds, a criminal case was opened against the author based on a complaint filed by ultra-nationalist lawyer Kemal Kerin√ßsiz. The charges were dropped on 22 January 2006. In Bilecik, his books were burnt in a nationalist rally. Pamuk has subsequently stated his intent was to draw attention to freedom of speech issues. However, Kemal Kerin√ßsiz, the lawyer who had originally pressed charges against Pamuk, appealed to the Supreme Court of Appeal which ordered the court in ≈ûi≈üli to re-open the case. On 27 March 2011, Pamuk was found guilty and ordered to pay 6,000 liras in total compensation to five people for, among others, having insulted their honor. =Pamuk's statements= The criminal charges against Pamuk resulted from remarks he made during an interview in February 2005 with the Swiss publication Das Magazin, a weekly supplement to a number of Swiss daily newspapers: the Tages-Anzeiger, the Basler Zeitung, the Berner Zeitung and the Solothurner Tagblatt. In the interview, Pamuk stated, \\"Thirty thousand Kurds have been killed here, and a million Armenians. And almost nobody dares to mention that. So I do.\\" Turkish historians were divided over the remarks. Pamuk stated that he was consequently subjected to a hate campaign that forced him to flee the country. He returned later in 2005, however, to face the charges against him. In an interview with BBC News, he said that he wanted to defend freedom of speech, which was Turkey's only hope for coming to terms with its history: \\"What happened to the Ottoman Armenians in 1915 was a major thing that was hidden from the Turkish nation; it was a taboo. But we have to be able to talk about the past.\\" However, when Turkish television, CNN TURK asked Pamuk about his speech, he admitted that he said that \\"Armenians were killed\\" but he rejected that he said \\"Turks killed Armenians\\" and he estimated the number of deaths (as 1 million) in that speech. =Prosecution= At the time, Article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code stated: \\"A person who publicly insults the Republic or Turkish Grand National Assembly, shall be punishable by imprisonment of between six months to three years.\\" Pamuk was charged with violating this law in the interview. In October, after the prosecution had begun, Pamuk reiterated his views in a speech given during an award ceremony in Germany: \\"I repeat, I said loud and clear that one million Armenians and 30,000 Kurds were killed in Turkey.\\" Article 301's old form before 2005 (and also the new form after the amendments in 2008) required that prosecution under the article needs to be approved by the Ministry of Justice. A few minutes after Pamuk's trial started on 16 December, the judge found that this approval had not yet been received and suspended the proceedings. In an interview published in the Ak≈üam newspaper the same day, the then Justice Minister Cemil √ái√ßek said he had not yet received Pamuk's file but would study it thoroughly once it came. On 29 December 2005, Turkish state prosecutors dropped the charge that Pamuk insulted Turkey's armed forces, although the charge of \\"insulting Turkishness\\" remained. =International reaction= The charges against Pamuk caused an international outcry and led to questions in some circles about Turkey's proposed entry into the European Union. On 30 November, the European Parliament announced that it would send a delegation of five MEPs led by Camiel Eurlings, to observe the trial. EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn subsequently stated that the Pamuk case would be a \\"litmus test\\" of Turkey's commitment to the EU's membership criteria. On 1 December, Amnesty International released a statement calling for Article 301 to be repealed and for Pamuk and six other people awaiting trial under the act to be freed. PEN American Center also denounced the charges against Pamuk, stating: \\"PEN finds it extraordinary that a state that has ratified both the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the European Convention on Human Rights, both of which see freedom of expression as central, should have a Penal Code that includes a clause that is so clearly contrary to these very same principles.\\" On 13 December, eight world-renowned authors‚ÄîJos√© Saramago, Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez, G√ºnter Grass, Umberto Eco, Carlos Fuentes, Juan Goytisolo, John Updike and Mario Vargas Llosa‚Äîissued a joint statement supporting Pamuk and decrying the charges against him as a violation of human rights. In 2008, in an open online poll, Pamuk was voted as the fourth most intellectual person in the world on the list of Top 100 Public Intellectuals by Prospect Magazine (United Kingdom) and Foreign Policy (United States). =Charges dropped= On 22 January 2006, Turkey's Justice Ministry refused to issue an approval of the prosecution, saying that they had no authority to open a case against Pamuk under the new penal code. With the trial in the local court, it was ruled the next day that the case could not continue without Justice Ministry approval. Pamuk's lawyer, Haluk ƒ∞nanƒ±cƒ±, subsequently confirmed that charges had been dropped. The announcement occurred in a week when the EU was scheduled to begin a review of the Turkish justice system. =Interplay= EU enlargement commissioner Olli Rehn welcomed the dropping of charges, saying \\"This is obviously good news for Mr. Pamuk, but it's also good news for freedom of expression in Turkey\\". However, some EU representatives expressed disappointment that the justice ministry had rejected the prosecution on a technicality rather than on principle. An Ankara-based EU diplomat reportedly said, \\"It is good the case has apparently been dropped, but the justice ministry never took a clear position or gave any sign of trying to defend Pamuk\\". Meanwhile, the lawyer who had led the effort to try Pamuk, Kemal Kerin√ßsiz, said he would appeal the decision, saying, \\"Orhan Pamuk must be punished for insulting Turkey and Turkishness, it is a grave crime and it should not be left unpunished.\\" In 2006, the magazine Time listed Pamuk in the cover article \\"TIME 100: The People Who Shape Our World\\", in the category \\"Heroes & Pioneers\\", for speaking up. In April 2006, on the BBC's HARDtalk program, Pamuk stated that his remarks regarding the Armenian Genocide were meant to draw attention to freedom of expression issues in Turkey rather than to the massacres themselves. On 19‚Äì20 December 2006, a symposium on Orhan Pamuk and His Work was held at Sabancƒ± University, Istanbul. Pamuk himself gave the closing address. In January 2008, 13 ultranationalists, including Kemal Kerin√ßsiz, were arrested by Turkish authorities for participating in a Turkish nationalist underground organisation, named Ergenekon, allegedly conspiring to assassinate political figures, including several Christian missionaries and Armenian intellectual Hrant Dink. Several reports suggest that Pamuk was among the figures this group plotted to kill. The police informed Pamuk about the assassination plans eight months before the Ergenekon investigation. Awards and honours =Nobel Prize= On 12 October 2006, the Swedish Academy announced that he had been awarded the 2006 Nobel Prize in Literature, confounding pundits and oddsmakers who had concluded that Syrian poet Ali Ahmad Said, known as Adunis, was most likely to receive that year's award. There were concerns within Turkey that the decision to award the Nobel Prize to Pamuk was politically motivated. In its citation, the Academy said: \\"In the quest for the melancholic soul of his native city, [Pamuk] has discovered new symbols for the clash and interlacing of cultures.\\" Pamuk held his Nobel Lecture on 7 December 2006 at the Swedish Academy, Stockholm. The lecture was entitled \\"Babamƒ±n Bavulu\\" (\\"My Father's Suitcase\\") and was given in Turkish. In the lecture he allegorically spoke of relations between Eastern and Western civilizations using the theme of his relationship with his father. Pamuk's books broke a record and sold over 200,000 copies after the announcement of his success, leading to him becoming Turkey's best-selling recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature. =Other awards and honours= * 1979 Milliyet Press Novel Contest Award (Turkey) for his novel Karanlƒ±k ve I≈üƒ±k (co-winner) * 1983 Orhan Kemal Novel Prize (Turkey) for his novel Cevdet Bey ve Oƒüullarƒ± * 1984 Madarali Novel Prize (Turkey) for his novel Sessiz Ev * 1990 Independent Foreign Fiction Prize (United Kingdom) for his novel Beyaz Kale * 1991 Prix de la D√©couverte Europ√©enne (France) for the French edition of Sessiz Ev : La Maison de Silence * 1991 Antalya Golden Orange Film Festival (Turkey) Best Original Screenplay Gizli Y√ºz * 1995 Prix France Culture (France) for his novel Kara Kitap: Le Livre Noir * 2002 Prix du Meilleur Livre Etranger (France) for his novel My Name Is Red: Mon Nom est Rouge * 2002 Premio Grinzane Cavour (Italy) for his novel My Name Is Red * 2003 International Dublin Literary Award (Ireland) for his novel My Name Is Red (awarded jointly with translator Erdaƒü M.

A participant in the program is called a Cub. A group of Cubs is called a 'Pack'. The Wolf Cub program was originated by The Boy Scouts Association in the United Kingdom in 1916 to provide a program for boys who were too young to be Boy Scouts. It was adopted by many other Scouting organizations. Many Scouting organizations, including The Scout Association, no longer use the Wolf Cub program and have replaced it with other programs but have retained the name Cubs. Others, including Traditional Scouting organizations, maintain the original Wolf Cubs program. Originally Cubs programs were open only to boys, while young girls could join the Brownies. Some Cub organizations are open to both girls and boys, although not necessarily in the same unit. A few organizations also operate a Sea Cub version of Cubs. Foundation A British Wolf Cub in the late 1960s The Wolf Cub scheme was started by The Boy Scouts Association in 1916, nine years after the idea of the Boy Scouts was conceived, in order to cater to the many younger boys who were too young to be Boy Scouts. During these first years many troops had either allowed younger boys to join or had set up unofficial junior or cadet Scout troops. In 1916, articles in the Headquarters Gazette (a then regular journal for leaders) outlined official \\"Junior Scout\\" then \\"Wolf Cub\\" schemes. However, Robert Baden-Powell wanted something quite different from a watered down Boy Scout program and recognized that too close an association between the junior program and the Boy Scouts would detract from both. Baden-Powell wanted a junior scheme with distinct name, uniform and other identity and program. In 1916, Baden-Powell published his own outlines for such a scheme, it was to be called Wolf Cubs. Baden-Powell asked his friend Rudyard Kipling for the use of his Jungle Book history and universe as a motivational frame for the Wolf Cub scheme. The scheme was given a publicity launch at The Boy Scouts Association's Imperial Headquarters in Buckingham Palace Road, Westminster, on Saturday 24 June 1916. Baden-Powell wrote a new book, The Wolf Cub's Handbook, the first edition of which was published in December 1916. He collaborated with Vera Barclay in devising the Wolf Cub training programme and badges, which were published in the second edition.Moynihan, Paul (editor) 2006, An Official History of Scouting, Hamlyn, (p. 56) On 16 December 1916, a public display of the new section was held at Caxton Hall, Westminster, to which Kipling was invited; he was unable to attend but sent Baden-Powell a letter of apology, praising his work with the Scout Movement.Moynihan 2006 p. 59 Vera Barclay co founded Wolf Cubs with Baden -Powell in 1916 . From the 1960s, many organizations varied or abandoned the Wolf Cub Jungle Book theme. Some organizations changed the name to Cubs, Cub Scouts or something similar but retained the Jungle Stories and Cub ceremony as tradition‚Äîsuch as the use of Jungle Book names (as described below); and the Grand Howl which signals the start and end of Cub Meetings. Other organizations kept the name but dropped the Jungle Book theme totally. Originally, Cub membership was open only to boys while the Brownies were set up as a parallel section for young girls. This remains the situation in some places. Most member organizations of the World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM) admitted girls to Cubs while others have separate co-ed sections with a different theme. Most member organizations of the Union Internationale des Guides et Scouts d'Europe (UIGSE) have two single sex sections both named Wolf Cubs and both in the jungle theme. Cub Scouting has ideals of spiritual and character growth, citizenship training, and personal fitness. Cub Scouting provides a positive, encouraging peer group, carefully selected leaders who provide good role models and a group setting where values are taught to reinforce positive qualities of character. Organization Cubs are organized in packs, which are sometimes linked to a Scout group, providing a community with all age sections known as a \\"Scouting family \\". Adult leaders of Cub packs take the names of The Jungle Book 's main characters. In many countries the leader of the Pack is called Akela. Cubs have a distinctive two-finger salute according to the Jungle theme, in contrast to the three-finger salute of Boy Scouts. However, in the Scout Association of United Kingdom (UK) and some of its overseas branches the two-finger salute was later replaced by the three-finger salute. Historically, Cubs wear a distinctive headdress, which is a tight- fitting green felt cap with green felt visor, yellow pipings, and an emblem at the front ‚Äî although in some countries this has been replaced by more contemporary headgear or dispensed with entirely. Just as Scout troops are subdivided into patrols, Cub packs are divided into small teams. Baden-Powell named the team a Six, which refers to the six members in each team. In most countries Sixes are mixed-age groups with the oldest as sixer (\\"leader\\"). In the Boy Scouts of America (BSA), the teams are called dens, with each den serving either boys or girls in the same school grade. Youth leaders from more senior sections of Scouting are actively encouraged to assist as Cub leaders. In the UK and in Australia these were originally called Cub Instructors. Within Scouts Australia the term Youth Helper is now formally applied to such persons, whilst in the United Kingdom they are called Young Leaders. In Canada, a Scout who assists in the Cub program is designated as a Kim. In the United States, the term Den Chief is used. In many European countries (especially where the Jungle theme still has a strong part in the programme), Saint Francis of Assisi is the patron saint of Cubs, because of his relationship with wolves. Cub Camp, Crivitz, Wisconsin, 2007 Cubs in national organizations =Australia= Baden-Powell Scouts' Association The Baden-Powell Scouts' Association in Australia operate a 'Wolf Cub' section between its Koalas program and Boy Scout. Wolf Cub packs are themed on \\"The Jungle Book\\" by Rudyard Kipling, a friend of Baden-Powell. Wolf Cub packs are divided into Sixes, with each six being identified by a coloured triangular patch on the member's arm. Each Six is led by a 'Sixer' and a 'Seconder', who have their rank indicated by horizontal yellow stripes sewn onto their left arm. Scouts Australia In Scouts Australia, the Cub Scout program is open to all children (girls and boys) ages 7.5-11. The uniform is a navy-blue, button-up or polo-style, short sleeved shirt with a yellow collar, sleeves and shoulders. Accessed 1 November 2016 Sixes are identified by a coloured round badge (black, white, tawny, brown, red, grey) in the shirt shoulder. Sixers wear an oblong strip on the front of their uniform which says \\"Sixer\\", they are supported by their Second, who will step into the leadership role if the Sixer is away, and who also helps at the Closing Parade. One of the duties of the Sixer is to perform flag duty (lowering the flag) at the end of Parade. Sixer and Second walk to the front of the Pack, who are standing in a circle (denotes Council Rock from the Jungle Book), they face the flag and salute, then the Sixer lowers the flag onto the shoulder (or waiting arms) of the Second. =Austria= In Pfadfinder und Pfadfinderinnen √ñsterreichs Cub Scouting is the section for children in the age of 7 to 10. The jungle theme is the symbolic framework. The first pack was started in autumn of 1920 in Vienna. At the beginning there were different symbolic frameworks: red Indians (taken from \\"Kibbo Kift\\" written by John Hargrave) and Robinson Crusoe. In the 1930s the Jungle theme was introduced. =Canada= In 1916, the Cub Scout program was introduced as part of Scouts Canada with a programme similar to that of the UK. Cub Scouting is open to youth of both sexes, ages 8 to 10 inclusive. Sixes wear a coloured triangular patch, rather than a distinctive woggle. (If brown, for example, the six is known as Brown Six.) The Cub motto is \\"Do Your Best\\" and the promise, the vow recited in opening ceremonies is: \\"I promise to do my best, to do my duty to God and the Queen, to keep the law of the Wolfcub pack, and do a good turn every day.\\" =Hong Kong= The tradition of Cub Scouting in Hong Kong was inherited from the British. It is the largest section of the Scout Movement in Hong Kong. A Pack is headed by a Cub Scout Leader (ÂúòÈï∑), with several Assistant Cub Scout Leaders (ÂâØÂúòÈï∑) and Instructors (ÊïôÁ∑¥Âì°). The division within a Pack is called a Six (Â∞èÈöä). Each Six has a Sixer (ÈöäÈï∑) and a Seconder (ÈöäÂâØ or ÂâØÈöäÈï∑). Each Six is distinguished by a colour and is named after it. Each member of the Six wears a woggle with the colour of his Six. The Promise and Law for the Cub Scouts are simplified from those for Scouts. Traditionally, the logo of the Wolf Cub denotes the Cub Scouts, but it is rarely used. =Ireland= In Ireland, the section is known as both Cub Scouts and Macaoimh, depending on the tradition from which the particular Scout troop comes. =Netherlands= The jungle theme is the symbolic framework of the Welpen (Cubs). Welpen wear green uniforms. Among a horde (\\"pack\\") of Cub Scouts, the cubs are divided into nesten (\\"nests\\"). Each nest has a Gids (Guide) and a Helper. Like all sections Welpen is open to both boys and girls, but Scout Groups can have single-sex sections. Starting 2010 the symbolic framework of the Welpen will be based on a modified version of the Jungle Book with two main characters: the boy Mowgli and the girl Shanti. The new Welpen section will gradually replace the four sections in the age group Scouting Nederland had before: Welpen, Kabouters (Brownies), Dolfijnen (\\"Dolphins\\") and Esta's. Dolfijnen has a water based symbolic framework, Esta's has a special developed co-ed symbolic framework. The new Welpen contains elements from all four previous sections. =New Zealand= In New Zealand, the Cubs section is known as Cub Scouts, and largely follows the format of the United Kingdom, though it is administered under the main Scouts New Zealand association. The Cub section is for children aged 8 to 11 years. They meet weekly at their Scout Hall and take part in all sorts of activities. There are approximately 410NZ scout groups in New Zealand scout groups in New Zealand, all of which have a cub section, typically along with other sections for younger kids (Keas) and older members (Scouts, Venturers and Rovers) .Scouts New Zealand Sections. =Poland= Cub from Poland, 2009 In the Polish Scouting and Guiding Association, Cub Scouts and Brownies's section is called \\"zuchy\\" and is open to children ages 6-10. Members are organized into cub packs where they learn to integrate into a collective of friends. Any kind of learning is accomplished by playing games. They can earn three Cub Scout Stars \\"Gwiazdki zuchowe\\" and a lot of individual and group merit badges. =Singapore= In Singapore, the junior section of the Scouting movement was known as the Cadet Scouts, until 2005 when it was renamed to Cub Scouts in line with international practice. Cub Scout 's age group is from 7‚Äì12, following the Jungle Book Theme . Each Cub Scout Pack is led by Cub Scout Leader assisted by Asst. Cub Scout Leaders. Pack are sub divided to small group in six cubs called Six. Within the Six, is led by Sixer and Asst. Sixer. Cub Scout Pack in Singapore, majority are in School and the teachers are the Cub Scout Leader and Asst. Cub Scout Leaders, some parent are also involved and actively served as Volunteer Adult Leaders (VAL). Highest Award for the Cub Scout is Akela Award. It is awarded to the cub scouts who completed the badge scheme and assessments criteria. =United Kingdom= Baden-Powell Scouts' Association The Baden-Powell Scouts' Association operate a 'Wolf Cub' section between Beavers and Scouts. Wolf Cub packs are themed on \\"The Jungle Book\\" by Rudyard Kipling, a friend of Baden-Powell. Wolf Cub packs are divided into Sixes, with each six being identified by a coloured triangular patch on the member's arm. Each Six is led by a 'Sixer' and a 'Seconder', who have their rank indicated by horizontal yellow stripes sewn onto their left arm.Baden-Powell Scouts' Wolf Cubs British Boy Scouts The British Boy Scouts and British Girl Scouts Association allow use of the Wolf Cubs program as an alternative to its Junior Scout section.The Constitution of the British Boy Scouts and British Girl Scouts Association. Version 18/06/2002. page 10, 20. British Boy Scouts and British Girl Scouts Association. The Scout Association In the Scout Association, Sixes are led by a 'Sixer' and have a 'Seconder' (or 'Second') as a backup. The Sixer wears two stripes on his/her uniform and the Seconder one stripe. When a Cub Scout is made a Sixer, the Second's badge (with one stripe) should be removed and replaced with the Sixer's badge. The members of a six are distinguished by the colour of the woggle they wear on their Group neckerchief (known elsewhere as a Group scarf). The three points of the fleur-de-lys, Scout salute and Scout sign remind the cub scout of the three points of the Cub Scout's Promise: \\"Duty to God and Queen, Helpfulness to other people, and Obedience to the Cub Scout Law.\\" An American Cub in uniform, 1968 =United States= Detroit, U.S. Cubs around 1942 Boy Scouts of America Cub Scouting is a division of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA). Starting in 1918, a number of experiments operated until 1930, when the first official Cub Scout packs were registered. Today, it is a family program for children in kindergarten through fifth grade, with each den admitting boys or girls only. Parents, leaders, and organizations work together to achieve the purposes of Cub Scouting. Families are a core part of Cub Scouts and are included in many activities. Currently, Cub Scouting is the largest of the BSA's three membership divisions. Baden-Powell Service Association In the Baden-Powell Service Association, the corresponding section for this age group is called Timberwolves. As with the Scout Association, each pack is divided into Sixes led by a 'Sixer' with a 'Seconder' assisting. The Pack retains Baden-Powell's original Jungle Book theme, with its leader called Akela and assistant leaders using names like Raksha, Bagheera, or Baloo.

It was originally broadcast on April 16, 2003. In the episode, Jennifer Lopez is enraged to learn that a new Latina singer also named Jennifer Lopez (but in actuality is just Cartman's hand) has stolen her record deal and her boyfriend Ben Affleck.  Plot  South Park Elementary holds a cultural diversity event in which Kyle Broflovski gives a report on the role of Latinos in American technology. A board of Latino community leaders (who are the judges) seem pleased with Kyle's report. Cartman goes on stage to report on the effect of Latino culture on the arts in America. He says he has a special guest, Jennifer Lopez. However, it turns out to merely be a ventriloquist act with Cartman's hand acting as the head of \\"Ms. Lopez\\" (reminiscent of Se√±or Wences) who is a Hispanic stereotype in every way. Despite this offensive display, the judges inexplicably give him first place for having the best report, and he wins a $20 gift certificate at the mall. This angers Kyle, as he thinks Cartman's speech is racist and immature, and because while Kyle had spent weeks laboring over his speech, it is implied that Cartman spent very little time in preparation. Cartman further enrages Kyle by insisting that \\"Ms. Lopez\\" has a mind of her own. When the children go to the mall, Cartman‚Äîat the apparent behest of \\"Ms. Lopez\\"‚Äîpays ten dollars to record a music video at a recording store. The video gets sent to the record company, proving a success and propelling \\"Ms. Lopez\\" to stardom. However, the executives agree that \\"Ms. Lopez\\" has too many similarities to the actual Jennifer Lopez and decide to replace the more difficult human performer with the puppet because they cannot have two Jennifer Lopezes. When the actual Jennifer Lopez learns she is being fired, she is infuriated, especially when she learns that her job has been replaced by a puppet. Jennifer Lopez and her husband-to-be, Ben Affleck, show up at South Park Elementary in a limousine. Lopez starts to beat up Cartman's hand until he pleads that he will stop his ventriloquist act. As the two celebrities leave, Affleck catches sight of \\"Ms. Lopez\\" and falls in love with her. Tension between Cartman and the hand-puppet escalates as \\"Ms. Lopez\\" forces him to do things her way. As the episode progresses, the relationship between Cartman and \\"Miss Lopez\\" begins to grow more surreal, with Cartman and \\"Miss Lopez\\" arguing (with both their voices being heard simultaneously) and \\"Miss Lopez\\" acting independently while Cartman is asleep. Affleck invites \\"Ms. Lopez\\" for a ride in his car. Cartman reluctantly agrees. Later \\"Ms. Lopez\\" lets Ben make out with her, then she performs oral sex on him. Cartman looks down, sees what \\"Ms. Lopez\\" (his hand) is doing, and, infuriated, departs the car quickly. The next morning Cartman awakes to find in his bed a naked Affleck, with \\"Ms. Lopez\\" announcing that they had made love all night. The news of the wedding again angers the actual Jennifer Lopez as she attempts to kill \\"Ms. Lopez\\". Cartman runs. On a bridge, Jennifer Lopez, the police, Ben Affleck, the people from the recording company, Kyle, Kenny and Stan catch up with Cartman and \\"Ms. Lopez\\". Everyone (except the boys) starts to argue about \\"Ms. Lopez\\". \\"Ms. Lopez\\" screams for everyone to be quiet. Cartman removes her hair and \\"Ms. Lopez\\", in a male voice, makes the confession that her real name is Mitch Conner, a con man who has been moving around from town to town. Conner apologizes to Ben for playing with his heart and states that he will die because he has recently consumed a cyanide pill. Conner then \\"dies\\" (Cartman makes it look like he \\"flutters away\\" into the wind), and everyone goes away except for the boys. Kyle then asks Cartman to explain Mitch Conner. Cartman says, \\"Look, I don't care what you guys believe. But with all the crazy stuff that goes on in this town, isn't it possible, just possible, that something I don't understand happened here?\\" When Kyle admits that it's possible, Cartman starts singing, \\"Ha ha ha ha haa haa! I got you, kinda! I got you, kinda!\\", much to Kyle's dismay. The episode ends with Jennifer Lopez working at a La Taco restaurant while on probation. She complains she had six platinum records and starred in five Hollywood movies. The Mexican worker next to her responds, \\"Yeah, me too.\\" Legacy * Cartman's ventriloquist act of Mitch Conner / Jennifer Lopez returned in the season 14 episodes \\"200\\" and \\"201\\". It also returned in the video game South Park: The Fractured But Whole, with both Cartman and later Kyle in control of Mitch Connor. It is revealed here that Cartman is, in fact, in total control of Mitch. * In the commentary, Trey Parker has stated that this episode has his favorite ending because it is so surreal and \\"you don't even know if Cartman is lying or not\\".

Musicians in Aleppo, Syria, the Musician on the far left using the daf. Iranian Kurds from Sanandaj The daf (; ;), is a large Kurdish and Persian frame drum used in popular and classical music. It is also used in religious ceremonies among Kurds. The Daf is considered the national musical instrument of Pakistan. History The instrument is depicted in mesolithic cave painting at Lakha Juar, Bhimbhetka and in Assyrian Empire relief. The Pahlavi (an ancient Iranian language) name of the daf is dap. Some pictures of dap have been found in paintings that date before the Common Era. The presence of Iranian dap in the reliefs of Behistun suggests the daf existed before the rise of Islam. Shunga art and Mathura art carved panels around 2nd BCE - 2nd CE, also show ancient Indians playing this instrument by beating it with metal or wooden sticks like dholak or simply using their hands. Dafs were part of religious music in Iran much before Sufism. Iranian music has always been a spiritual tool. It shows that dafs played an important role in Mazdean Iran emerging as an important element during the Sassanian times during the K√¢vusak√¢n dynasty. Also, there is a kind of square frame drum in the stonecutting of Taq-e Bostan (another famous monument located northeast of Kermanshah city). These frame drums were played in the ancient Middle East (chiefly by women in Kurdish societies), Greece, and Rome and reached medieval Europe through Islamic culture. Nowruz (the first day of the Iranian New Year and the national festival of the Iranian peoples) and other festive occasions have been accompanied by dap in Sassanid periods (224 A.D. - 651 A.D.). In this period the dap was played in order to accompany Iranian classical music. Daps were likely used in the court to be played in the modes and melodies of traditional music. This traditional or classical music was created by Barbod the Great and was named the khosravani after the mythical king Khosrow. Recent research reveals that these modes were used in the recitation of Mazdean (Zoroastrian) prayers. The modes were passed down from master to student and are today known as the radif and dastgah system. Many of the melodies were lost, but most of those that remain date to the Sassanid period. Dafs can be played to produce highly complex and intense rhythms, causing one to go under a trance and reach an ecstatic and spiritually-high state. For this reason, they have always been connected with religion in Iran. The Arabs introduced the daf and other Middle Eastern musical instruments to Spain, and the Spanish adapted and promoted the daf and other musical instruments (such as the guitar) in medieval Europe. In the 15th century, the daf was only used in Sufi ceremonies; the Ottomans reintroduced it to Europe in the 17th century. The art of daf playing in Iranian Kurdistan and other parts of Iran has reached us by the effort of Iranian Sufis; especially in the 20th century. The daf still functions as an important part of Persian art music (traditional or classical music) as it did in ancient times. It successfully encourages many young Iranians to take up learning this ancient instrument. Cultural references In the history of Iran, daf had important usage specially in celebrations. According to some Muslims, it was the only musical instrument permitted by the Islamic prophet Muhammad to play during celebrations.

The fire killed 85 people, most through smoke inhalation. The tragedy remains the deadliest disaster in Nevada history, and the third-deadliest hotel fire in modern U.S. history, after the 1946 Winecoff Hotel fire in Atlanta that killed 119 people and the 1986 Dupont Plaza Hotel fire in Puerto Rico that killed 97. Fire At the time of the fire, about 5,000 people were in the MGM Grand, a casino and 26-story hotel with more than 2,000 hotel rooms, opened in 1973. At approximately 7:07 a.m. on Friday, November 21, 1980, a fire began in a restaurant known as The Deli. The fire was discovered during an inspection of the restaurant by a tile crew. A crew supervisor noticed a flickering light, which turned out to be a wall of flames. An employee of the hotel's bakery recounted how just after 7 a.m. he saw smoke coming from the ceiling vents and the lights went out. MGM security was immediately advised of the situation, and alerted the Clark County Fire Department (CCFD) which was the first agency to respond. CCFD received a call reporting the fire at 7:17 am, with the first engine arriving on site from across the street at 7:19 am. A third alarm was called at 7:22 am, and a Metro Police helicopter pilot requested all available helicopters at 7:30 am. Other agencies included the North Las Vegas Fire Department, Las Vegas Fire & Rescue, and the Henderson Fire Department. A massive helicopter rescue effort from Nellis Air Force Base pulled 1,000 people from the roof of the MGM Grand, involving both U.S. Air Force UH-1N (Hueys) from the 57th Wing based in Indian Springs and CH-3E (Jolly Green Giants) from the 1st Special Operations Wing based in Hurlburt Field, Florida (which were in Nevada to participate in Red Flag '80). Looking east as smoke rises from the property The fire spread to the lobby, fed by wallpaper, PVC piping, glue, and plastic mirrors, racing west through the casino floor at a speed of until a massive fireball blew out the main entrance along the Las Vegas Strip. From the time the fire was noticed, it took six minutes for the entire building to be fully engulfed. It spread across the areas of the casino in which no fire sprinklers were installed. Eighteen people died in the casino level of the hotel. The burning material created toxic fumes and smoke, which ascended throughout the hotel tower via vertical shafts (elevators and stairwells) and seismic joints and caused the majority of the deaths. Firefighters reported having to crawl through the dark and over \\"mounds of stuff\\" trying to extinguish the fire, it was later determined that the \\"mounds\\" were deceased guests and staff near an elevator bank. Proper evacuation of the hotel guests was hindered as there was no automatic means of returning elevators to the main floor during a fire, causing 10 deceased victims to be found in an elevator. Some hotel guests tied bedsheets together and hung them on balconies to alert first responders. Some tried using the bedsheets to descend the hotel's exterior. Fire ladders were only able to reach the ninth-floor exterior. One man escaped the hotel tower by lowering himself down a rope. A second hotel tower was under construction at the time of the fire, and a construction worker used a scaffolding platform to lower guests to the ground, after they had escaped through their hotel room windows. People below had to dodge shards of glass falling from the broken hotel windows. The Barbary Coast casino across the street was set up as an evacuation center for MGM guests. = Victims = A total of 85 people were killed (including seven employees) and 650 injured, including guests, employees, and 14 firefighters. While the fire primarily damaged the second- floor casino and adjacent restaurants, 61 deaths were on the upper floors of the hotel (19th - 24th floors), mostly in the stairwells, where all doors except on the roof and ground floor were locked and the smoke concentration was the highest. One young couple died in their sleep. Seventy-five people died from smoke inhalation and carbon monoxide poisoning; four from smoke inhalation alone; three from burns and smoke inhalation; one from burns alone; one from massive skull trauma, caused by jumping from a high window; and one of myocarditis. The disaster led to the general publicizing of the fact that during a building fire, smoke inhalation is a more serious threat than flames. Two refrigerated semi-trailers were set up as temporary morgues to hold the bodies of victims until they could be identified. Cause The fire was confined to the casino and restaurant areas. The hotel was equipped with a fire sprinkler system that performed properly by keeping the fire out of other sections of the building. The area with the most fire prevention was in the money counting area, not in individual rooms or on the casino floor. The county's fire chief had been concerned that such a fire could occur, as older hotels built prior to 1979 were not required to have certain fire safety features. Nevada governor Robert List said, \\"You can't force people to bring hotels up to codes that didn't exist when they were built.\\" = Electric fire = The fire was caused by an electrical ground fault inside a wall-mounted electrical receptacle. A refrigerated pastry display case was added, after original construction of the hotel, to one of its restaurants (known as The Deli). Unlike a modern display case, which would be totally self-contained (compressor installed in bottom of display case), this unit functioned like a walk-in cooler or central air conditioning system, with a pair of copper refrigerant lines connecting its evaporator to a condensing unit located outside the building. When this set-up was installed, the copper lineset was run through the same wall soffit as a pre-existing electrical conduit and in physical contact with the conduit. The fan-forced evaporator unit in the display case was not properly secured, and thus was able to vibrate constantly while in operation; these vibrations were carried along the copper refrigerant lines, causing the pipes to rub against the electrical conduit in the wall soffit and make them vibrate as well. Galvanic corrosion occurred, in which the copper refrigerant pipes were in physical contact with the aluminum electrical conduit, causing the conduit to erode over time. Galvanic corrosion and vibration ‚Äì as well as jagged edges and stretched wires resulting from poor workmanship during the installation ‚Äì eventually resulted in the electrical wires inside the conduit missing chunks of their plastic insulation. The conduit was rendered un-grounded (there was no separate ground wire; the metal conduit itself was designed to function as the ground, so the disintegration of the conduit rendered the system un-grounded). These now-bare electrical conductors inside the un-grounded metal conduit glowed red-hot and began arcing, which ignited the fire. The fire reportedly smoldered for hours until it found fresh oxygen and burst into a fireball that spread into the casino, and was fed by other combustibles. = Spread of smoke = Due to faulty smoke dampers within the ventilation duct network, the toxic fumes circulated throughout the hotel's air conditioning system, accelerating the spread of the poisonous gases. The continued operation of the resort's ventilation system contributed to the fire's harmful effect. On the casino floor, there was no outlet for the smoke, which was spread into the hotel tower by the ventilation system. Smoke rapidly filled the resort's telephone switchboard room, and operators there only had enough time to warn people on the casino floor. Hotel guests were not notified of the fire, as the switchboard operators had to evacuate. The elevator shafts were located above the restaurant and casino, which also helped the smoke to spread. Guests, who earlier had found that the fire doors in some stairwells locked automatically, had propped them open for convenience. However, this allowed more smoke to spread. Sprinkler rule exceptions Sprinklers were located on the first two floors and the top floor of the resort. The casino and restaurants were not protected by a fire sprinkler system because they were exempt from rules requiring sprinklers in areas occupied 24 hours a day. A Clark County building inspector granted the exemption‚Äîdespite the opposition of fire marshals‚Äîreasoning that a fire would be quickly noticed by occupants and contained with portable fire extinguishers. When the fire started in The Deli restaurant, it was no longer open 24 hours per day; it was closed at the time of the fire. Although some sprinklers were in the resort, they were not located anywhere near the fire. A full sprinkler system would have cost $192,000. Because of the cost, MGM only installed the minimum number of sprinklers as required, during the resort's construction. Aftermath The resort was temporarily closed because of the fire. Much of the damage occurred in the casino, which was charred by the fire. The hotel hallways and stairwells were stained by soot and smoke. State gaming revenues were hurt by the MGM's closure, as the resort was one of the largest tax contributors to the local gaming industry. The county lost an estimated $1.7 million because of the closure, and it was estimated that MGM Grand Hotels could face a $1 billion loss because of the fire. After the fire, the MGM Grand was rebuilt over the next eight months, at a cost of $50 million. It reopened in July 1981, with numerous fire safety features now in place, including the addition of fire sprinklers and an automatic fire alarm system throughout the property. A two-unit computer ‚Äì one of them a backup ‚Äì was provided by Johnson Controls to monitor hundreds of locations throughout the MGM, helping to prevent another fire. A similar computer had also been installed at another MGM Grand hotel in Reno, Nevada. The Las Vegas MGM now had more than 30,000 sprinklers, including four in most hotel rooms. The hotel also had 8,000 speakers, including one in each room, allowing for fire safety instructions to be provided to guests in the event of a fire. The original MGM tower, seen in 2008 as part of Bally's The air-conditioning system was heavily modified to prevent smoke from entering hotel rooms, and large exhaust fans were installed, with the capability to rid the hotel of fumes in 10 minutes. Plastic pipes and wires, which contributed to the fire, were removed. A five- minute fire safety program, hosted by Gene Kelly in both English and Spanish, was played on televisions in hotel rooms. Resort officials believed that the MGM was now the safest hotel in the world. A minor incident occurred less than two weeks after the reopening, and the new safety features worked as planned. Insulation material had begun to smolder because of a welder's torch, and this set off automatic alarms. Hundreds of lawsuits had been filed against MGM, seeking more than $2 billion in damages. One attorney, representing three local couples against MGM, expressed upset feelings about the reopening, saying that the resort still had defects which could prove harmful in the event of another fire. MGM made numerous settlement deals with the victims in 1983. In 1998, there was $440,000 left over in the MGM settlement. The remaining money was donated to people in Clark County who were victims of fires and burns. The original hotel tower, where most of the deaths occurred, continues to operate. The second tower opened in 1981. The MGM Grand was sold in 1986 to Bally Manufacturing, which changed the name to Bally's Las Vegas. A new MGM Grand was opened in Las Vegas in 1993, at the northeast corner of Las Vegas Boulevard and Tropicana Avenue, south of the original MGM. = Code changes = Within a week of the fire, Governor List formed a commission to determine whether older hotels in the state should be required to adopt newer fire safety rules. On February 10, 1981, just 81 days after the MGM fire, another fire broke out at the Las Vegas Hilton, killing at least five people. Due to the two incidents, there was a major reformation of fire safety guidelines and codes. All buildings open to the public in Nevada were required to have fire sprinklers, smoke detectors in rooms and elevators, and exit maps in all hotel rooms. This law went into effect in 1981 and made Nevada a leader in fire safety regulation. See also *List of hotel fires in the United States *Skyscraper fire References * *Bryan, John (1992).

He was the son of Oshin of Armenia and Isabel of Korikos, and came to the throne on the death of his father. His name is sometimes spelled as Leo or Leon. He spent his minority under the regency of Oshin of Korikos. During this period, the kingdom was much harassed by Mamluks and Mongols. In 1320, the Egyptian sultan Naser Mohammed ibn Kelaoun invaded and ravaged Christian Armenian Cilicia. In a letter dated July 1, 1322, and sent from Avignon, Pope John XXII reminded Mongol ruler Abu Sa'id Bahadur Khan of the alliance of his ancestors with Christians, asking him to intervene in Cilicia. At the same time he advocated that he abandon Islam in favor of Christianity. Mongol troops were sent to Cilicia, but only arrived after a ceasefire had been negotiated for 15 years between Constantin, patriarch of the Armenians, and the sultan of Egypt. The regent Oshin had married his stepmother, Joan of Taranto, and Leo was forced to marry Alice Oshin's daughter by his first wife, Margaret d'Ibelin, on August 10, 1321. Oshin murdered a number of members of the royal family to consolidate his own power, and Leo's reaction upon reaching his majority in 1329 was violent. Oshin, his brother Constantine, Constable of Armenia and Lord of Lampron, and Leo's wife Alice were all murdered on the king's orders, Oshin's head being sent to the Il-Khan and Constantine's head to Al-Nasr Muhammad. Leo had his aunt Isabella, wife of the late Amalric, Lord of Tyre, and two of her sons imprisoned and then executed. Leo was strongly pro-Western and favored a union of the Armenian and Roman Churches, which deeply displeased the native barons. His second marriage on December 29, 1331 to Constance, daughter of Frederick III of Sicily and Eleanor of Anjou, widow of Henry II of Cyprus, further aroused anti-Western sentiment. In 1337, Al-Nasr Muhammad invaded again, taking the city of Ayas, and Leo was forced to conclude a humiliating truce, surrendering territory and a large indemnity and promising to have no dealings with the West. He spent the last years of his reign holed up in the citadel at Sis, hoping for Western aid. On August 28, 1341 he was murdered by his own barons. His only son by Alice, Hethum, had died before 1331; the barons elected his cousin Constantine II to succeed him.

Geography  The Kƒ±zƒ±lƒ±rmak flows for a total of , rising in Eastern Anatolia around , flowing first to the west and southwest until , then forming a wide arch, the \\"Halys bend\\", flowing first to the west, then to the northwest, passing to the northeast of Lake Tuz, then to the north and northeast, where it is joined by its major tributary, the Delice River (also known by its Greek name Cappadox) at , and after zigzagging to the northwest to the confluence with the Devrez River at , and back to the northeast, joining the G√∂kƒ±rmak before finally flowing through its delta into the Black Sea at . Dams on the river include the Boyabat, Altƒ±nkaya and Derbent. History The Hittites called it the Mara≈°≈°antiya. It formed the western boundary of Hatti, the core land of the Hittite empire. Until the Roman conquest of Anatolia the Halys River, later called by Turkish conquerors the Kƒ±zƒ±lƒ±rmak, served as a natural political boundary in central Asia Minor, first between the kingdom of Lydia and the Persian Empire, and later between the Pontic Kingdom and the Kingdom of Cappadocia. In the 1st century AD Vespasian combined several provinces, including Cappadocia, to create one large province; its eastern boundary was marked by the Euphrates River. This province once again splintered during Trajans reign‚Äîthe newly created province of Cappadocia, bounded by the Euphrates to the East, included Pontus and Lesser Armenia. The Halys River remained an interior river and never regained its significance as a political border. In the 130s a governor of Cappadocia wrote: \\"long ago the Halys River was the boundary between the kingdom of Croesus and the Persian Empire; now it flows under Roman dominion.\\" As the site of the Battle of Halys or Battle of the Eclipse on May 28, 585 BC,Historically it was known as the Battle of Halys; it has since been renamed by some as the Battle of the Eclipse, as the first premodern battle which can be dated with certainty due to the eclipse which brought about its sudden end. it was the border between Lydia to the west and Media to the east until Croesus of Lydia crossed it to attack Cyrus the Great in 547 BC. He was defeated and Persia expanded to the Aegean Sea. Agriculture The river water is used to grow rice and in some areas water buffalo are kept.

For protection against the frequent floods of the Mississippi River, Waterloo was surrounded by levees, the large state-maintained levee in the rear and a small levee maintained by the community itself at the river's edge. Both of these levees broke during the flood of 1884, seriously damaging Waterloo and the smaller communities of Anchor and Cook's Landing immediately downriver. What the river did not destroy, arsonists did during the mid-1890s and there is nothing left to indicate that the town once existed. Most of the families who lived at Waterloo moved to the parish seat of New Roads, just a few miles to the west on False River. The names Waterloo, Anchor, and Cook's Landing are perpetuated, however, in the street names of nearby subdivisions of new homes developed between 1968 and 2007. It is also not uncommon for residents of these subdivisions to uncover remnants of the communities while performing any sort of excavation upon their properties.

The cheval de frise (plural: chevaux de frise , \\"Frisian horses\\") was an anti- cavalry measure consisting of a portable frame (sometimes just a simple log) covered with many projecting long iron or wooden spikes or spears. They were principally intended as an anti-cavalry obstacle but could also be moved quickly to help block a breach in another barrier. They remained in occasional use until they were replaced by wire obstacles just after the American Civil War. During the Civil War, the Confederates used this type of barrier more often than the Union forces.. During World War I, armies used chevaux de frise to temporarily plug gaps in barbed wire.https://web.archive.org/web/20080517184133/http://www.1914-1918.net/Diaries/wardiary-2msex.htm Barbed wire chevaux de frise were used in jungle fighting on the South Pacific islands during World War II. The term is also applied to defensive works on buildings. This includes a series of closely set upright stones found outside the ramparts of Iron Age hillforts in northern Europe, or iron spikes outside homes in Charleston, South Carolina. Etymology Chevaux de frise, according to the later use of the term, could include broken glass studding the top of a wall in a nineteenth-century fort In French, cheval de frise means \\"Frisian horse\\"..Friesian horse. The Frisians fought predominantly using cavalry;http://www.thefriesianempire.com/friesianhistory.html they were known for being formidable horsemen, and Frisian horses were renowned for their strength and agility. Therefore, for defense they relied heavily on anti- cavalry obstacles. The Dutch also adopted the use of these defensive devices when at war with Spain. The term cheval de frise came to be used for any spiked obstacle, such as broken glass embedded in mortar at the top of a wall. The cheval de frise was adopted in New York and Pennsylvania during the American Revolutionary War as a defensive measure installed on rivers to prevent upriver movement by enemy ships. Use Hessian map showing the placement of chevaux de frise in the Delaware River in 1777. During the American Revolutionary War, Robert Erskine designed an anti-ship version of the cheval-de-frise to prevent British warships from proceeding up the Hudson River. A cheval de frise was placed between Fort Washington at northern Manhattan and Fort Lee in New Jersey in 1776. The following year construction began on another one to the north of West Point at Pollepel Island, but it was overshadowed by the completion of the Hudson River Chain across the Hudson in 1778, which was used through 1782. Similar devices planned by Ben Franklin and designed by Robert Smith were used in the Delaware River near Philadelphia, between Fort Mifflin and Fort Mercer.. Two other lines of chevaux-de-frise were also placed across the Delaware River at Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania and Fort Billingsport, New Jersey as a first line of defense for Philadelphia against the British naval forces. A cheval de frise was retrieved from the Delaware River in Philadelphia on November 13, 2007, in excellent condition, after more than two centuries in the river. In November 2012, a spike from a cheval-de-frise was recovered from Delaware off Bristol Township; it was also believed to be from the Revolutionary era installation at Philadelphia and freed up by Hurricane Sandy earlier that fall.Elizabeth Fisher, \\"SANDY STIRS UP HISTORY: Revolutionary War spike pulled from the river depths in Bristol\\", Bristol Pilot, 21 November 2012, accessed 15 May 2014 Legacy A small promontory on the north-east Essex coast in the United Kingdom (UK), between Holland Haven and Frinton-on-Sea, was named Chevaux de Frise Point.

Service ceiling Service ceiling is where the rate of climb drops below a prescribed value. The service ceiling is the maximum usable altitude of an aircraft. Specifically, it is the density altitude at which flying in a clean configuration, at the best rate of climb airspeed for that altitude and with all engines operating and producing maximum continuous power, will produce a given rate of climb. A typical value might be climb, or on the order of climb for jet aircraft. The one-engine inoperative (OEI) service ceiling of a twin-engine, fixed-wing aircraft is the density altitude at which flying in a clean configuration, at the best rate of climb airspeed for that altitude with one engine producing maximum continuous power and the other engine shut down and feathered, will produce a given rate of climb, usually . However, some performance charts will define the service ceiling as the pressure altitude at which the aircraft will have the capability of climbing at with one propeller feathered. Most commercial jetliners have a service (or certificated) ceiling of about and some business jets about .See e.g. Bombardier Global Express XRS Specifications. Before its retirement, the Concorde supersonic transport (SST) routinely flew at . Absolute ceiling The absolute ceiling is the highest altitude at which an aircraft can sustain level flight. Due to the thin air at higher altitudes, a much higher true airspeed is required to generate sufficient lift on the wings. The absolute ceiling is therefore the altitude at which the engines are operating at maximum thrust, yet only generate enough lift to match the weight of the aircraft. Hence, the aircraft will not have any excess capacity to climb further. At absolute ceiling, the aircraft can no longer accelerate, since any acceleration will lead to higher airspeed and therefore excess lift. Stated technically, it is the altitude where the maximum sustained (with no decreasing airspeed) rate of climb is zero. Compared to service ceiling, the absolute ceiling of commercial aircraft is much higher than for standard operational purposes. In the Concorde's case, it was tested to be . It is impossible to reach for most (because of the vertical speed asymptotically approaching zero) without afterburners or other devices temporarily increasing thrust. Another factor that makes it impossible for some aircraft to reach their absolute ceiling, even with temporary increases in thrust, is the aircraft reaching the \\"coffin corner\\". Flight at the absolute ceiling is also not economically advantageous due to the low indicated airspeed which can be sustained: although the true airspeed (TAS) at an altitude is typically greater than indicated airspeed (IAS), the difference is not enough to compensate for the fact that IAS at which minimum drag is achieved is usually low, so a flight at an absolute ceiling altitude results in a low TAS as well, and therefore in a high fuel burn rate per distance traveled. The absolute ceiling varies with the air temperature and, overall, the aircraft weight (usually calculated at MTOW).

But his tireless work on behalf of the New Deal often was overshadowed by his many personal escapades, which included dancing in fountains and driving on the White House lawn. Beset by the press and by critics of Roosevelt's policies, Zioncheck became depressed and hinted that he might not seek reelection to a third term in 1936. In his diary entry for April 30, 1936, Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes recounted how Zioncheck had asked him to officiate at a wedding with his fianc√©e, Rubye Louise Nix. Ickes demurred, saying that he had no authority to do so; he was aware of Zioncheck's reputation and simply did not want to get involved. Ultimately, Zioncheck went to Annapolis, Maryland for the wedding and San Juan, Puerto Rico for his honeymoon. On August 1, Zioncheck's friend and ally, King County Prosecutor Warren G. Magnuson, took him at his word regarding his retirement plans and filed to run for Zioncheck's House seat. Marital and mental problems On May 30, 1936, his wife left him after an argument during a party at their apartment. On June 1, he became frantic and searched Washington, D.C. for her. He was arrested later that day on a lunacy warrant. He was confined in Gallinger Municipal Hospital Psychopathic Ward, during which his wife returned to him. Doctors blamed overwork and his hectic lifestyle. He was later transferred to a private facility in Towson, Maryland, but escaped and fled to Washington, where he received congressional immunity.  Death  Zioncheck died after plummeting to the sidewalk from a window of his office on the fifth floor of the Arctic Building, at 3rd Avenue and Cherry Street in downtown Seattle, on August 7, 1936. He struck the pavement directly in front of a car occupied by his wife. A note was found; it read, \\"My only hope in life was to improve the condition of an unfair economic system that held no promise to those that all the wealth of even a decent chance to survive let alone live.\\" Zioncheck was mourned at his early death; both the University of Washington and Boeing closed down for half a day in his honor. He is buried in Evergreen-Washelli Cemetery in Seattle.  Zioncheck for President  Zioncheck is the subject of an unpublished book-length poem by Grant Cogswell, entitled Ode to Congressman Marion Zioncheck. The story of Zioncheck, and Cogswell's obsession with him, is detailed in Phil Campbell's 2005 book Zioncheck for President: A True Story of Idealism and Madness in American Politics (Nation Books; ). The option to make Campbell's book into a feature film was purchased in 2007 by producer/director Stephen Gyllenhaal.

They demanded the departure of all Americans from Lebanon and took responsibility for a number of kidnappings, assassinations, and bombings of embassies and peacekeeping troops which killed several hundred people. Their deadliest attacks were in 1983, when they carried out the bombing of the barracks of French and U.S. MNF peacekeeping troops, and that of the United States embassy in Beirut. Origins Possibly formed in early 1983 and reportedly led by Imad Mughniyah, a former Lebanese Shi'ite member of Palestinian Fatah's Force 17, the IJO was not a militia but rather a typical underground urban guerrilla organization. Based at Baalbek in the Beqaa valley, the group aligned 200 Lebanese Shi'ite militants financed by Iran and trained by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards' contingent previously sent by Ayatollah Khomeini to fight the June 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon. However, senior Iranian officials denied the alleged connections. For instance, Mehdi Karroubi claimed that Iran had not been related to the group.

Islamic Jihad released a photograph that claimed to show the (dead) body of French citizen Michel Seurat, who had been kidnapped earlier. Decline and demise 1986‚Äì1992 The IJO suffered a setback in 1986 when their temporary abduction of four Soviet diplomats carried out previously on September 1985 ended up in the assassination of one hostage. The KGB promptly retaliated with intimidation and by pressuring Syria to stop its operations in northern Lebanon in exchange for release of the remaining three hostages. This fiasco, coupled by the pressure resulting from tighter security measures and joint anti-militia sweeps implemented by the Syrian Army, the Lebanese Internal Security Forces (ISF) and the Shi'ite Amal militia at the Shia quarters of West Beirut in 1987‚Äì88, brought a steady decline in the organization's activities in Lebanon for the rest of the civil war. The last recorded attack claimed by the IJO as an independent group took place outside the Middle East in March 1992, when the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires, Argentina, was blown up in retaliation for Israel's assassination of Hezbollah's secretary-general Abbas al-Musawi in February that year. This organization is no longer active. Some reports indicate that they merged with Hezbollah afterwards, with their leader Imad Mughniyah appointed head of that party's overseas security apparatus.

It is distinguished from genetic variability, which describes the tendency of genetic characteristics to vary. Genetic diversity serves as a way for populations to adapt to changing environments. With more variation, it is more likely that some individuals in a population will possess variations of alleles that are suited for the environment. Those individuals are more likely to survive to produce offspring bearing that allele. The population will continue for more generations because of the success of these individuals. The academic field of population genetics includes several hypotheses and theories regarding genetic diversity. The neutral theory of evolution proposes that diversity is the result of the accumulation of neutral substitutions. Diversifying selection is the hypothesis that two subpopulations of a species live in different environments that select for different alleles at a particular locus. This may occur, for instance, if a species has a large range relative to the mobility of individuals within it. Frequency-dependent selection is the hypothesis that as alleles become more common, they become more vulnerable. This occurs in host‚Äìpathogen interactions, where a high frequency of a defensive allele among the host means that it is more likely that a pathogen will spread if it is able to overcome that allele. A graphical representation of the typical human karyotype. Within species diversity Varieties of maize in the office of the Russian plant geneticist Nikolai Vavilov A study conducted by the National Science Foundation in 2007 found that genetic diversity (within species diversity) and biodiversity are dependent upon each other ‚Äî i.e. that diversity within a species is necessary to maintain diversity among species, and vice versa. According to the lead researcher in the study, Dr. Richard Lankau, \\"If any one type is removed from the system, the cycle can break down, and the community becomes dominated by a single species.\\" Genotypic and phenotypic diversity have been found in all species at the protein, DNA, and organismal levels; in nature, this diversity is nonrandom, heavily structured, and correlated with environmental variation and stress. The interdependence between genetic and species diversity is delicate. Changes in species diversity lead to changes in the environment, leading to adaptation of the remaining species. Changes in genetic diversity, such as in loss of species, leads to a loss of biological diversity. Loss of genetic diversity in domestic animal populations has also been studied and attributed to the extension of markets and economic globalization. Website with additional information: http://www.sinauer.com/groom/ Evolutionary importance of genetic diversity = Adaptation = Variation in the populations gene pool allows natural selection to act upon traits that allow the population to adapt to changing environments. Selection for or against a trait can occur with changing environment ‚Äì resulting in an increase in genetic diversity (if a new mutation is selected for and maintained) or a decrease in genetic diversity (if a disadvantageous allele is selected against). Hence, genetic diversity plays an important role in the survival and adaptability of a species. The capability of the population to adapt to the changing environment will depend on the presence of the necessary genetic diversity The more genetic diversity a population has, the more likelihood the population will be able to adapt and survive. Conversely, the vulnerability of a population to changes, such as climate change or novel diseases will increase with reduction in genetic diversity. For example, the inability of koalas to adapt to fight Chlamydia and the koala retrovirus (KoRV) has been linked to the koala's low genetic diversity. This low genetic diversity also has geneticists concerned for the koalas ability to adapt to climate change and human-induced environmental changes in the future. = Small populations = Large populations are more likely to maintain genetic material and thus generally have higher genetic diversity. Small populations are more likely to experience the loss of diversity over time by random chance, which is called genetic drift. When an allele (variant of a gene) drifts to fixation, the other allele at the same locus is lost, resulting in a loss in genetic diversity. In small population sizes, inbreeding, or mating between individuals with similar genetic makeup, is more likely to occur, thus perpetuating more common alleles to the point of fixation, thus decreasing genetic diversity. Concerns about genetic diversity are therefore especially important with large mammals due to their small population size and high levels of human-caused population effects.[16] A genetic bottleneck can occur when a population goes through a period of low number of individuals, resulting in a rapid decrease in genetic diversity. Even with an increase in population size, the genetic diversity often continues to be low if the entire species began with a small population, since beneficial mutations (see below) are rare, and the gene pool is limited by the small starting population. This is an important consideration in the area of conservation genetics, when working toward a rescued population or species that is genetically-healthy. = Mutation = Random mutations consistently generate genetic variation. A mutation will increase genetic diversity in the short term, as a new gene is introduced to the gene pool. However, the persistence of this gene is dependent of drift and selection (see above). Most new mutations either have a neutral or negative effect on fitness, while some have a positive effect. A beneficial mutation is more likely to persist and thus have a long-term positive effect on genetic diversity. Mutation rates differ across the genome, and larger populations have greater mutation rates. In smaller populations a mutation is less likely to persist because it is more likely to be eliminated by drift. = Gene flow = Gene flow, often by migration, is the movement of genetic material (for example by pollen in the wind, or the migration of a bird). Gene flow can introduce novel alleles to a population. These alleles can be integrated into the population, thus increasing genetic diversity. For example, an insecticide-resistant mutation arose in Anopheles gambiae African mosquitoes. Migration of some A. gambiae mosquitoes to a population of Anopheles coluzziin mosquitoes resulted in a transfer of the beneficial resistance gene from one species to the other. The genetic diversity was increased in A. gambiae by mutation and in A. coluzziin by gene flow. In agriculture =In crops= When humans initially started farming, they used selective breeding to pass on desirable traits of the crops while omitting the undesirable ones. Selective breeding leads to monocultures: entire farms of nearly genetically identical plants. Little to no genetic diversity makes crops extremely susceptible to widespread disease; bacteria morph and change constantly and when a disease-causing bacterium changes to attack a specific genetic variation, it can easily wipe out vast quantities of the species. If the genetic variation that the bacterium is best at attacking happens to be that which humans have selectively bred to use for harvest, the entire crop will be wiped out. The nineteenth-century Great Famine in Ireland was caused in part by a lack of biodiversity. Since new potato plants do not come as a result of reproduction, but rather from pieces of the parent plant, no genetic diversity is developed, and the entire crop is essentially a clone of one potato, it is especially susceptible to an epidemic. In the 1840s, much of Ireland's population depended on potatoes for food. They planted namely the \\"lumper\\" variety of potato, which was susceptible to a rot-causing oomycete called Phytophthora infestans. The fungus destroyed the vast majority of the potato crop, and left one million people to starve to death. Genetic diversity in agriculture does not only relate to disease, but also herbivores. Similarly, to the above example, monoculture agriculture selects for traits that are uniform throughout the plot. If this genotype is susceptible to certain herbivores, this could result in the loss of a large portion of the crop. One way farmers get around this is through inter-cropping. By planting rows of unrelated, or genetically distinct crops as barriers between herbivores and their preferred host plant, the farmer effectively reduces the ability of the herbivore to spread throughout the entire plot. =In livestock= The genetic diversity of livestock species permits animal husbandry in a range of environments and with a range of different objectives. It provides the raw material for selective breeding programmes and allows livestock populations to adapt as environmental conditions change. Livestock biodiversity can be lost as a result of breed extinctions and other forms of genetic erosion. As of June 2014, among the 8,774 breeds recorded in the Domestic Animal Diversity Information System (DAD-IS), operated by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), 17 percent were classified as being at risk of extinction and 7 percent already extinct. There is now a Global Plan of Action for Animal Genetic Resources that was developed under the auspices of the Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture in 2007, that provides a framework and guidelines for the management of animal genetic resources. Awareness of the importance of maintaining animal genetic resources has increased over time. FAO has published two reports on the state of the world's animal genetic resources for food and agriculture, which cover detailed analyses of our global livestock diversity and ability to manage and conserve them.  Viral implications  High genetic diversity in viruses must be considered when designing vaccinations. High genetic diversity results in difficulty in designing targeted vaccines, and allows for viruses to quickly evolve to resist vaccination lethality. For example, malaria vaccinations are impacted by high levels of genetic diversity in the protein antigens. In addition, HIV-1 genetic diversity limits the use of currently available viral load and resistance tests.  Coping with low genetic diversity  Photomontage of planktonic organisms.A Tanzanian cheetah. = Natural = The natural world has several ways of preserving or increasing genetic diversity. Among oceanic plankton, viruses aid in the genetic shifting process. Ocean viruses, which infect the plankton, carry genes of other organisms in addition to their own. When a virus containing the genes of one cell infects another, the genetic makeup of the latter changes. This constant shift of genetic makeup helps to maintain a healthy population of plankton despite complex and unpredictable environmental changes. Cheetahs are a threatened species. Low genetic diversity and resulting poor sperm quality has made breeding and survivorship difficult for cheetahs. Moreover, only about 5% of cheetahs survive to adulthood However, it has been recently discovered that female cheetahs can mate with more than one male per litter of cubs. They undergo induced ovulation, which means that a new egg is produced every time a female mates. By mating with multiple males, the mother increases the genetic diversity within a single litter of cubs. = Human intervention = Attempts to increase the viability of a species by increasing genetic diversity is called genetic rescue. For example, eight panthers from Texas were introduced to the Florida panther population, which was declining and suffering from inbreeding depression. Genetic variation was thus increased and resulted in a significant increase in population growth of the Florida Panther. Creating or maintaining high genetic diversity is an important consideration in species rescue efforts, in order to ensure the longevity of a population. Measures Genetic diversity of a population can be assessed by some simple measures. *Gene diversity is the proportion of polymorphic loci across the genome. *Heterozygosity is the fraction of individuals in a population that are heterozygous for a particular locus. *Alleles per locus is also used to demonstrate variability. *Nucleotide diversity is the extent of nucleotide polymorphisms within a population, and is commonly measured through molecular markers such as micro- and minisatellite sequences, mitochondrial DNA, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Furthermore, stochastic simulation software is commonly used to predict the future of a population given measures such as allele frequency and population size. Genetic diversity can also be measured.The various recorded ways of measuring genetic diversity include: * Species richness is a measure of the number of species * Species abundance a relative measure of the abundance of species * Species density an evaluation of the total number of species per unit area See also *Biodiversity *Center of diversity *Genetic variation *Human genetic variation *Human Variome Project *International HapMap Project References External links *Implementing the Global Plan of Action on Animal Genetic Resources * Domestic Animal Diversity Information System * Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture Category:Biodiversity Category:Genetics concepts Category:Population genetics ","title":"Genetic diversity"},{"id":"403630","text":"The Return of the Prodigal Son (1773) by Pompeo Batoni The Parable of the Prodigal Son (also known as the parable of the Two Brothers, Lost Son, Loving Father, or of the Forgiving Father)\\"The Parable of the Lost Son.\\" Holy Bible (New International Version). ‚Äì via BibleGateway, Biblica, Inc. 2011 [1973].\\"Parable of the Forgiving Father (15:11-32).\\" Holy Bible (IVP New Testament Commentaries). ‚Äì via BibleGateway. 2016. is one of the parables of Jesus in the Bible, appearing in Luke 15:11‚Äì32.

The father tells the older son: \\"you are ever with me, and all that I have is yours, but thy younger brother was lost and now he is found.\\" The Prodigal Son is the third and final parable of a cycle on redemption, following the parable of the Lost Sheep and the parable of the Lost Coin. In Revised Common Lectionary and Roman Rite Catholic Lectionary, this parable is read on the fourth Sunday of Lent (in Year C); in the latter it is also included in the long form of the Gospel on the 24th Sunday of Ordinary Time in Year C, along with the preceding two parables of the cycle. In the Eastern Orthodox Church it is read on the Sunday of the Prodigal Son. Narrative James Tissot ‚Äì The Return of the Prodigal Son (Le retour de l'enfant prodigue) ‚Äì Brooklyn Museum The parable begins with a man who had two sons, and the younger of them asks his father to give him his share of the estate. The implication is the son could not wait for his father's death for his inheritance, he wanted it immediately. The father agrees and divides his estate between both sons. Upon receiving his portion of the inheritance, the younger son travels to a distant country and wastes all his money in extravagant living. Immediately thereafter, a famine strikes the land; he becomes desperately poor and is forced to take work as a swineherd. (This, too, would have been abhorrent to Jesus' Jewish audience, who considered swine unclean animals.) When he reaches the point of envying the food of the pigs he is watching, he finally comes to his senses:. This implies the father was hopefully watching for the son's return. In most versions of Luke, the son does not even have time to finish his rehearsed speech, before his father accepts him back wholeheartedly without hesitationNicoll, William R., ed. 1897.

Some ancient authorities complete verse 21 in line with the son's prepared statement. as the father calls for his servants to dress him in a fine robe, a ring, and sandals, and slaughter the \\"fatted calf\\" for a celebratory meal. The older son, who was at work in the fields, hears the sound of celebration, and is told about the return of his younger brother. He is not impressed, and becomes angry. He also has a speech for his father: The parable concludes with the father explaining that because the younger son had returned, in a sense, from the dead, celebration was necessary: Context and interpretation The Prodigal Son, a 1618 painting by Rubens of the son as a swineherd Engraving of the Prodigal Son as a swineherd by Hans Sebald Beham, 1538 The opening, \\"A man had two sons\\" is a storyteller's trope and would immediately bring to mind Cain & Abel, Ishmael & Isaac, and Esau & Jacob.

The Polish Rider; possibly the prodigal son. The subject is of much discussion. =Art= Of the thirty-or-so parables in the canonical Gospels, this parable was one of four that were shown in medieval art‚Äîalong with that of the Wise and Foolish Virgins, the Dives and Lazarus, and the Good Samaritan‚Äîalmost to the exclusion of the others, though not mixed in with the narrative scenes of the Life of Christ.M√¢le, Emile. 1973 [1913]. The Gothic Image: Religious Art in France of the Thirteenth Century (1st ed.), translated by D. Nussey. London: Collins. . p. 195. (The Labourers in the Vineyard also appears in Early Medieval works.) From the Renaissance, the numbers shown widened slightly, and the various scenes of the Prodigal Son‚Äîthe high living, herding the pigs, and the return‚Äîbecame the clear favourite. Albrecht D√ºrer made a famous engraving, the \\"Prodigal Son amongst the Pigs\\" (1496), a popular subject in the Northern Renaissance. Rembrandt depicted several scenes from the parable, especially the final episode, which he etched, drew, or painted on several occasions during his career.Fleischer, Roland E., and Susan C. Scott. 1997. Rembrandt, Rubens, and the art of their time: recent perspectives. US: Penn State University Press. . pp. 64-65. At least one of his works‚Äîi.e., \\"The Prodigal Son in the Tavern\\", a portrait of himself as the Son revelling with his wife‚Äîis, like many artists' depictions, a way of dignifying a genre tavern scene (if the title was indeed the original intention of the artist). His late \\"Return of the Prodigal Son\\" (1662‚Äì1669) is one of his most popular works. \\"The Prodigal Son\\" is a sculpture in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, by George Grey Barnard that depicts the loving reunion of the father and son from the \\"Parable of the Prodigal Son.\\"Diana Strazdes, et al., American Painting and Sculpture to 1945 in the Carnegie Museum of Art, (New York: Hudson Hills Press, 1992), pp. 55-58. =Stage= In the 15th and 16th centuries, the theme was a sufficiently popular subject that the 'Prodigal Son play' can be seen as a subgenre of the English morality play. Examples include The Rare Triumphs of Love and Fortune, The Disobedient Child, and Acolastus. Notable adaptations for performance include: * an 1869 oratorio by Arthur Sullivan; * an 1880 opera by Amilcare Ponchielli; * a 1884 cantata by Claude Debussy; * a 1929 ballet choreographed by George Balanchine to music by Sergei Prokofiev; * a 1957 ballet by Hugo Alfv√©n;Don Michael Randel, The Harvard Biographical Dictionary of Music, Harvard University Press, 1996, , pp. 13-14, and * an 1968 opera by Benjamin Britten. Many of these adaptations added to the original Biblical material to lengthen the story. For example, The Prodigal (1955) film took considerable liberties, such as adding a temptress priestess of Astarte to the tale.Hammond, Paul. 2000.

The book deals with three personages: the younger, prodigal son; the self-righteous, resentful older son; and the compassionate father‚Äîall of whom the author identifies with personally.LaNoue, Deirdre. 2000. The Spiritual Legacy of Henri Nouwen, Continuum. . p. 45. An earlier work with similarities to the parable is \\"Le retour de l'enfant prodigue\\" ('The Return of the Prodigal Son'), a short story by Andr√© Gide. Rudyard Kipling wrote a poem giving an interpretation of the younger brother's perspective. The poem appears as the heading to the fifth chapter, titled \\"The Prodigal Son\\", of his 1901 novel Kim.Kipling, Rudyard. 2017 [1901]. \\"The Prodigal Son,\\" edited with notes by P. Holberton.

The Parable is a recurring theme in the works of Rainer Maria Rilke, who interpreted it in a different way to the conventional reading. Rilke's version is not so concerned with redemption and the forgiveness of family: the love of the family, and human love in general, was seen as less worthy than unreciprocated love, which is the purest form of love. In loving the family less, the Son can love God more, even if this love is not returned.Rilke, Rainer Maria. 2000 [1907]. \\"The Departure of the Prodigal Son.\\" Pp. 41 in New Poems (bilingual ed.), translated by S. Cohn. Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press.Rilke, Rainer Maria. 2008 [1910]. The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge, translated by B. Pike. Champaign, IL: Dalkey Archive Press. p. 196. The theme of the Prodigal Son plays a major role in Anne Tyler's novel A Spool of Blue Thread. The parable is also referred to in two comedies by William Shakespeare, specifically The Merchant Of Venice and As You Like It, as well as in Shakespeare's romance, The Winter's Tale.Shakespeare, The Winter's Tale 4.4.89. Similar parable in Mahayana Buddhism A parable of a lost son can also be found in the Mahayana Buddhist Lotus Sutra.Kern, Johan H. C., trans. 2011 [1884]. \\"Disposition.\\" Ch. 4 in Saddharma Pundar√Æka or the Lotus of the True Law, (Sacred Books of the East 21), edited by M. M√ºller.

The two parables are so similar in their outline and many details that several scholars have assumed that one version has influenced the other or that both texts share a common origin.Lai, Whalen W. 1981. \\"The Buddhist 'Prodigal Son': A Story of Misperceptions.\\" Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies 4(2):91‚Äì98. However, an influence of the biblical story on the Lotus sutra is regarded as unlikely given the early dating of the stratum of the sutra containing the Buddhist parable. Despite their similarities, both parables continue differently after the two meet for the first time at the son's return. In the biblical story, there is an immediate reunion of the two. In contrast, in the Lotus sutra, the poor son does not recognize the rich man as his father. When the father sends out some attendants to welcome the son, the son panics, fearing some kind of retribution. The father then lets the son leave without telling him of their kinship. However, he gradually draws the son closer to him by employing him in successively higher positions, only to tell him of their kinship in the end. In the Buddhist parable, the father symbolises the Buddha, and the son symbolises any human being. Their kinship symbolises that any being has Buddha nature. The concealment of the kinship of the father to his son is regarded as a skillful means (Sanskrit: upƒÅya).

Historically centered in the Southeastern United States, particularly the Carolinas and Georgia, the Pentecostal Holiness Church now has an international presence. In 2000, the church reported a worldwide membership of over one million--over three million including affiliates. Heavily influenced by two major American revival movements‚Äîthe holiness movement of the late 19th century and the Pentecostal revival of the early 20th century‚Äîthe church's theological roots derive from John Wesley's teachings on sanctification. p. 30 Several ministers who were raised in the Pentecostal Holiness Church have come to have greater name recognition than the church itself, such as Oral Roberts, an internationally known charismatic evangelist; Charles Stanley, a former president of the Southern Baptist Convention; and C.M. Ward, a former Assemblies of God radio preacher. History =Origins= In 1894, the Methodist Episcopal Church, South adopted a statement which opposed the growing holiness movement in the church. Within a decade about 25 new holiness groups, including the Pentecostal Holiness Church, came into existence. Fire-Baptized Holiness The oldest group that is part of the foundation of the Pentecostal Holiness Church originated in 1895 as the Fire-Baptized Holiness Association in Olmitz, Iowa. The leader, Benjamin H. Irwin of Lincoln, Nebraska, a former Baptist preacher, organized the body into the national Fire-Baptized Holiness Church at Anderson, South Carolina, in August 1898. p. 466 By this time, Irwin's group had organized churches in eight U. S. states and two Canadian provinces. Pentecostal Holiness of North Carolina The first congregation to carry the name Pentecostal Holiness Church was formed in Goldsboro, North Carolina in 1898. This church was founded as a result of the evangelistic ministry of Abner Blackmon Crumpler, a Methodist evangelist.\\"Organizational Heritage\\", IPHC Manual 1993-1997, electronic edition. A year earlier, Crumpler had founded the inter-denominational North Carolina Holiness Association. p. 62 After his trial and acquittal by a Methodist ecclesiastical court for preaching holiness doctrines, Crumpler and several of his followers left the Methodist Church and formed a new denomination known as the Pentecostal Holiness Church (\\"Pentecostal\\" being a common name for holiness believers at the time). The first convention was held at Fayetteville, North Carolina in 1900. The convention adopted a denominational discipline, and Crumpler was elected president. In 1901 at a meeting in Magnolia, North Carolina, the word \\"Pentecostal\\" was dropped from the name to more fully associate the church with the holiness movement. p. 110 For the next eight years, the church would be known as \\"The Holiness Church of North Carolina\\". The church had congregations outside of North Carolina as well, principally in South Carolina and Virginia. Gaston B. Cashwell, a minister of the Methodist Church, joined Crumpler's group in 1903. He became a leading figure in the church and the Pentecostal movement on the east coast. p. 111 In 1906, he traveled to Los Angeles to visit the Pentecostal revival at the Azusa Street mission. While there he professed having received the baptism in the Holy Spirit and the evidence of speaking in tongues. Upon returning to Dunn, North Carolina, in December 1906, Cashwell preached the Pentecost experience in the local holiness church. The influence of the Pentecostal renewal grew while, at the same time, the leader and founder of the church, Abner Crumpler, though willing to accept speaking in tongues, did not accept the idea that it was the initial evidence of the baptism of the Holy Spirit. At the annual conference of 1908, Crumpler was re-elected president of the body; however, with a majority of the delegates having experienced tongues, he permanently disaffiliated himself from the church. p. 119 After Crumpler's departure, the conference added an article to the statement of faith, recognizing tongues as the initial evidence: The PHC Foreign Mission Board was formed in 1904, and its members were all women. In 1907, Tom J. McIntosh, a PHC member, traveled to China and may have been the first Pentecostal missionary to reach that nation. =Mergers and schisms= The octagonal Falcon Tabernacle was the site of the 1911 merger. The Fire-Baptized Holiness Association also embraced Pentecostalism around the same time, taking the line that the baptism in the Holy Spirit was the \\"baptism of fire\\" that it had been seeking. Given the similarities in doctrine and geographic reach with the Pentecostal Holiness Church, the two groups began talks on a merger. The two groups merged on January 30, 1911, at the Falcon Tabernacle in Falcon, North Carolina. The new denomination took the name of the smaller of the two, Pentecostal Holiness Church. S.D. Page was elected the first General Superintendent. Following the 1911 merger, the Tabernacle Pentecostal Church, originally the Brewerton Presbyterian Church, merged with the Pentecostal Holiness Church in 1915. Having Presbyterian roots and located mostly in South Carolina, this group of around 15 congregations was affiliated with Nickles Holmes Bible College in Greenville.\\"Pentecostal Holiness Church\\", Encyclopedia of Religion in the South, Samuel S. Hill, editor. After the mergers, the new denomination, which continued to go by the name Pentecostal Holiness Church, had about 200 churches with approximately 5,000 members. Property for the denomination's first headquarters was purchased in 1918 for $9,000 in Franklin Springs, Georgia. In 1918, several PHC members who wanted stricter standards concerning dress, amusements, tobacco, and association between the sexes withdrew to form the Pentecostal Fire-Baptized Holiness Church. In 1920, another schism came into the Pentecostal Holiness Church over divine healing and the use of medicine. Some pastors believed that while divine healing was provided in the atonement, Christians still had the right to turn to medicine and doctors. The majority of the church‚Äîas did many Pentecostals of the time‚Äîbelieved in trusting God for healing without turning to earthly means. The minority withdrew and formed the Congregational Holiness Church in 1921. =Further development= The Pentecostal Holiness Church was a charter member of the National Association of Evangelicals in 1943 and joined the Pentecostal Fellowship of North America in 1948. At the general conference a year later an attempt at merging with the mostly black United Holy Church failed when the United Holy Church asked if their members could attend the church's schools and colleges. In the 1960s, the Pentecostal Holiness Church began to branch out beyond the United States by affiliating with sister Pentecostal bodies in other parts of the world. In 1967, an affiliation was formed with the Pentecostal Methodist Church of Chile, one of the largest national Pentecostal churches in the world and the largest non-Catholic church in Chile. At the time, the Jotabeche Pentecostal Methodist congregation was the largest church in the world with over 60,000 members. With over 150,000 members, it ranks second to the Yoido Full Gospel Church in Seoul, South Korea. This denomination claims 1.7 million adherents. A similar affiliation was forged in 1985 with the Wesleyan Methodist Church of Brazil. A Neo-Pentecostal body with roots in the Brazilian Methodist Church, the Wesleyan Church numbered some 50,000 members and adherents in 1995. The word International was added to the church's name in 1975. =Recent history= The largest Pentecostal Holiness churches in the United States include The Gate Church in Oklahoma City, pastored by Tony Miller; Northwood Temple in Fayetteville, North Carolina, pastored by John Hedgepeth; SpiritLife Church (formerly known as Evangelistic Temple) in Tulsa, Oklahoma, pastored by Tommy McLaurin; Eastpointe Community Church in Oklahoma City, pastored by Shon and Rachel Burchett; Christian Heritage Church in Tallassee, Florida, pastored by Steve Dow; and Tree of Life Ministries in Lynchburg,VA, pastored by Mike Dodson. In 2000, the IPHC reported 10,463 churches and over a million members worldwide (over 3.4 million including affiliates). In 2006, membership in the United States was 308,510 in 1,965 churches. There were 28 regional conferences and missionaries in more than 90 nations. International offices were once located in Franklin Springs, Georgia, but are now located in Bethany, Oklahoma, a suburb of Oklahoma City.

The IPHC believes in common evangelical beliefs, including the Trinity, the dual nature of Christ, his crucifixion for the forgiving of sins, his resurrection and ascension to heaven, the inerrancy of the Bible, a literal belief in heaven and hell, and the responsibility of every believer to carry out the Great Commission. The church holds water baptism and communion (open communion observed quarterly) to be divine ordinances. Though not considered an ordinance, some of the churches also engage in the practice of feet washing. =Cardinal doctrines= Since the adoption of the article of faith on the baptism of the Holy Spirit in 1908, the Pentecostal Holiness Church has taught the following beliefs as their five cardinal doctrines: justification by faith, entire sanctification, the baptism in the Holy Spirit evidenced by speaking in tongues, Christ's atonement (including divine healing), and the premillennial second coming of Christ. Justification by faith The Pentecostal Holiness Church believes that no amount of good works can achieve justification or salvation. This is achieved only \\"on the basis of our faith in the shed blood, the resurrection, and the justifying righteousness\\" of Christ. Good works, however, are a product of salvation. \\"When we believe on Jesus Christ as our Savior, our sins are pardoned, we are justified, and we enter a state of righteousness, not our own, but His, both imputed and imparted\\".\\"8. Justification by Faith\\", Our Beliefs . Accessed January 14, 2011. Sanctification As a holiness church, the PHC believes that for the Christian there is not only justification and forgiveness for actual transgressions but also \\"complete cleansing of the justified believer from all indwelling sin and from its pollution.\\"\\"9. Cleansing\\", Our Beliefs . Accessed January 14, 2011. This cleansing is not \\"maturity\\" but a \\"crisis experience\\" and a \\"definite, instantaneous work of grace, obtainable by faith.\\" The church recognizes that there is maturity and growth in the life of the believer, but states that \\"we must get into this grace before we can grow in it.\\" The sanctified life is described as \\"one of separation from the world, a selfless life, a life of devotion to all the will of God, a life of holiness ... a life controlled by 'perfect love' which 'casteth out fear.'\\" The Pentecostal Holiness Church specifically rejects absolute perfection, angelic perfection, and sinless perfection‚Äîterms that imply that it is impossible for a sanctified believer to commit sin.\\"10. Sanctification\\", Our Beliefs . Accessed January 14, 2011. Baptism with the Holy Spirit As a Pentecostal church, the PHC believes the \\"baptism with the Holy Ghost and fire is obtainable by a definite act of appropriating faith on the part of the fully cleansed believer.\\" Spirit baptism is available to all believers and provides empowerment to witness for Christ. To receive the baptism, a person must have a \\"clean heart and life\\" and to \\"live in the fullness of the Holy Spirit's power and possession, one must continue to live a clean and consecrated life, free from sin, strife, worldliness, and pride, and must avoid attitudes and actions that tend to 'grieve' or 'quench' the Holy Spirit.\\" The Pentecostal Holiness Church distinguishes the initial evidence of Spirit baptism - which all believers experience when Spirit baptized - from the gift of tongues, which is not given to every Spirit-filled believer. Speaking in tongues is only the first sign of Spirit baptism. Other evidence that will follow Spirit baptism include: the fruit of the Spirit, power to witness for Christ, and power to endure the testings of faith and the oppositions of the world. Besides speaking in tongues, other spiritual gifts recorded in the Bible (specifically in 1 Corinthians 12, 13, and 14) are encouraged to operate in Pentecostal Holiness congregations for the edification of the Body of Christ.\\"11. The Baptism With the Holy Ghost and Speaking With Other Tongues\\", Our Beliefs . Accessed January 14, 2011. Divine healing The PHC believes that \\"provision was made in the atonement for the healing of our bodies\\".\\"12. Divine Healing\\", Our Beliefs . Accessed January 14, 2011. Congregations will pray for the healing of sick people and church elders will lay hands on and anoint the person being prayed over. While in its early years the Pentecostal Holiness were against receiving medical care, emphasizing divine healing, that is not the case today. The church teaches that Christians should believe in divine healing but also teaches that medical knowledge comes to humanity through God's grace. Second Coming The PHC believes in the imminent, personal, premillennial second coming of Jesus Christ. It will occur in two stages: the first stage will be the rapture of the saints before the Tribulation, and the second stage will be at the end of the Tribulation when Christ will return to defeat the Antichrist, judge the nations of the world, and begin his millennial reign.\\"13. The Second Coming of Jesus\\", Our Beliefs . Accessed January 14, 2011. Structure Reflecting its Methodist heritage, the IPHC is governed under the principles of connectionalism, a mixed system of episcopal and congregational polity.Section IV. A. 1. \\"Organization in General\\", IPHC Manual 1993-1997, electronic edition. Authority in the church is shared between local churches, quadrennial conferences, and the General Conference. Pentecostal Holiness congregations are self-governing in local affairs and are led by pastors. The pastor preaches, administers the ordinances, and promotes the \\"spiritual welfare\\" of congregants.Section IV. B. \\"Duties of the Pastor\\", IPHC Manual 1993-1997, electronic edition. Furthermore, the pastor is the chairman of the church board. Other than the pastor, the church board consists of deacons and a secretary/treasurer elected by the church members.Section IV. E. \\"Officials of the Local Church\\", IPHC Manual 1993-1997, electronic edition. The board is accountable to the pastor and church members, and pastors are accountable to the quadrennial conferences. Geographically, churches are organized into conferences led by conference superintendents. In their spiritual roles, superintendents function as bishops, and in their administrative roles they act as chief executive officers of their conference. All conference leaders are elected by their local conference but are accountable to the General Superintendent. The General Conference is the highest administrative body in the church. Under it are regional, annual, district, and missionary conferences. When the General Conference is out of session, the General Board of Administration acts as the church's governing body. In the IPHC, the terms \\"bishop\\" and \\"superintendent\\" are used interchangeably. The church recognizes the biblical office of bishop but does not believe in an historical episcopate or adhere to the doctrine of apostolic succession. The General Superintendent and Presiding Bishop, Dr. A. Doug Beacham, Jr., was elected in 2012. Educational and charitable institutions The IPHC has five affiliated institutions of higher education and operates several charitable organizations. The IPHC colleges are Emmanuel College in Franklin Springs, Georgia; Holmes Bible College in Greenville, South Carolina; Southwestern Christian University in Bethany, Oklahoma; and Advantage College in San Jose, California. Charitable organizations include the Falcon Children's Home, Alternative to Abortion Ministries, New Life Adoption Agency, and The Children's Center.

A gesture is a form of non-verbal communication or non- vocal communication in which visible bodily actions communicate particular messages, either in place of, or in conjunction with, speech. Gestures include movement of the hands, face, or other parts of the body. Gestures differ from physical non-verbal communication that does not communicate specific messages, such as purely expressive displays, proxemics, or displays of joint attention.Kendon, Adam. (2004) Gesture: Visible Action as Utterance. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. Gestures allow individuals to communicate a variety of feelings and thoughts, from contempt and hostility to approval and affection, often together with body language in addition to words when they speak. Gesticulation and speech work independently of each other, but join to provide emphasis and meaning. Gesture processing takes place in areas of the brain such as Broca's and Wernicke's areas, which are used by speech and sign language. In fact, language is thought by some scholars to have evolved in Homo sapiens from an earlier system consisting of manual gestures. The theory that language evolved from manual gestures, termed Gestural Theory, dates back to the work of 18th-century philosopher and priest Abb√© de Condillac, and has been revived by contemporary anthropologist Gordon W. Hewes, in 1973, as part of a discussion on the origin of language.  Research throughout the ages  Gestures have been studied throughout time from different philosophers. Marcus Fabius Quintilianus was a Roman Rhetorician who studied in his Institution Oratoria on how gesture can be used on rhetorical discourses. One of his greatest works and foundation for communication was the \\"Institutio Oratoria\\" where he explains his observations and nature of different oratories. A study done in 1644, by John Bulwer an English physician and early Baconian natural philosopher wrote five works exploring human communications pertaining to gestures. Bulwer analyzed dozens of gestures and provided a guide under his book named Chirologia which focused on hand gestures. In the 19th century, Andrea De Jorio an Italian antiquarian who considered a lot of research about body language published an extensive account of gesture expressions. Andrew N. Meltzoff an American psychologist internationally renown for infant and child development conducted a study in 1977 on the imitation of facial and manual gestures by newborns. The study concluded that \\"infants between 12 and 21 days of age can imitate the facial and manual gestures of parents\\". In 1992, David Mcneill, a professor of linguistics and psychology at the University of Chicago, wrote a book based on his ten years of research and concluded that \\"gestures do not simply form a part of what is said, but have an impact on thought itself.\\" Meltzoff argues that gestures directly transfer thoughts into visible forms, showing that ideas and language cannot always be express. A peer-reviewed journal Gesture has been published since 2001, and was founded by Adam Kendon and Cornelia M√ºller. The International Society for Gesture Studies (ISGS) was founded in 2002. Gesture has frequently been taken up by researchers in the field of dance studies and performance studies in ways that emphasize the ways they are culturally and contextually inflected. Performance scholar Carrie Noland describes gestures as \\"learned techniques of the body\\" and stresses the way gestures are embodied corporeal forms of cultural communication.Noland, Carrie. Agency and Embodiment : Performing Gestures/producing Culture. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 2009. p. 2. But rather than just residing within one cultural context, she describes how gestures migrate across bodies and locations to create new cultural meanings and associations. She also posits how they might function as a form of \\"resistance to homogenization\\" because they are so dependent on the specification of the bodies that perform them.Noland, Carrie. \\"Introduction.\\" Migration of Gesture. Ed. Carrie Noland and Sally Ann Ness. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2008. p. x. Gesture has also been taken up within queer theory, ethnic studies and their intersections in performance studies, as a way to think about how the moving body gains social meaning. Jos√© Esteban Mu√±oz uses the idea of gesture to mark a kind of refusal of finitude and certainty and links gesture to his ideas of ephemera. Mu√±oz specifically draws on the African- American dancer and drag queen performer Kevin Aviance to articulate his interest not in what queer gestures might mean, but what they might perform.Mu√±oz, Jos√© Esteban. Cruising Utopia: The Then and There of Queer Futurity. New York: New York University Press, 2009. Juana Mar√≠a Rodr√≠guez borrows ideas of phenomenology and draws on Noland and Mu√±oz to investigate how gesture functions in queer sexual practices as a way to rewrite gender and negotiate power relations. She also connects gesture to Giorgio Agamben's idea of \\"means without ends\\" to think about political projects of social justice that are incomplete, partial, and legibile within culturally and socially defined spheres of meaning.Rodr√≠guez, Juana Mar√≠a. Sexual Futures, Queer Gestures, and Other Latina Longings. New York: NYU Press, 2014. Within the field of linguistics, the most hotly contested aspect of gesture revolves around the subcategory of Lexical or Iconic Co-Speech Gestures. Adam Kendon was the first to hypothesize on their purpose when he argued that Lexical gestures do work to amplify or modulate the lexico-semantic content of the verbal speech with which they co-occur. However, since the late 1990s, most research has revolved around the contrasting hypothesis that Lexical gestures serve a primarily cognitive purpose in aiding the process of speech production. As of 2012, there is research to suggest that Lexical Gesture does indeed serve a primarily communicative purpose and cognitive only secondary, but in the realm of socio-pragmatic communication, rather than lexico-semantic modification. Typology (categories) Pointing at another person with an extended finger is considered rude in many cultures. Humans have the ability to communicate through language, but they can also express through gestures. In particular, gestures can be transmitted through movements of body parts, face, and body expressions. Researchers Goldin Meadow and Brentari D. conducted research in 2015 and concluded that communicating through sign language is no different from spoken language.Gesture, sign and language: The coming of age of sign language and gesture studies. Available from: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282760416_Gesture_sign_and_language_The_coming_of_age_of_sign_language_and_gesture_studies [accessed Nov 04 2018]. = Communicative vs. informative = The first way to distinguish between categories of gesture is to differentiate between communicative gesture and informative gesture. While most gestures can be defined as possibly happening during the course of spoken utterances, the informative-communicative dichotomy focuses on intentionality of meaning and communication in co-speech gesture.  Informative (Passive Gestures)  Informative gestures are passive gestures that provide information about the speaker as a person and not about what the speaker is trying to communicate. Some movements are not purely considered gestures, however a person could perform these adapters in such way like scratching, adjusting clothing, and tapping. These gestures can occur during speech, but they may also occur independently of communication, as they are not a part of active communication. While informative gestures may communicate information about the person speaking (e.g. itchy, uncomfortable, etc.), this communication is not engaged with any language being produced by the person gesturing.  Communicative (Active Gestures)  Communicative gestures are gestures that are produced intentionally and meaningfully by a person as a way of intensifying or modifying speech produced in the vocal tract (or with the hands in the case of sign languages), even though a speaker may not be actively aware that they are producing communicative gestures. For instance, on the picture above of Uncle Sam, he is pointing and sending a non-verbal form of gesture by implying he wants you to join the U.S. Army. This is a form of symbolic gesture, usually used in the absence of speech.  Body language relating to gestures  Body language is a form of non-verbal communication that allows visual cues that transmit messages without speaking. Gestures are movement that are made with the body: arms, hands, facial, etc. Authors Barbara Pease and Allan Pease, of \\"The Definitive Book of Body Language\\" concluded that everyone does a shoulder shrug, a gesture signifying that the person is not comprehending what they are supposed to be understanding. Also, that showing the palms of both hands to show a person is not hiding anything, and raising the eyebrows to indicate a greeting.Pease, Allan, and Barbara Pease. The Definitive Book of Body Language, 2006. Print. Finger gestures are commonly used in a variety of ways, from point at something to indicate that you want to show a person something to indicating a thumbs up to show everything is good. Also, in most cultures nodding your head signifies \\"Yes\\", which the book \\"The Definitive Book of Body Language\\" describes as submissive gesture to representing the conversation is going the direction of the person speaking. Interesting, the book explains that people who are born deaf can show a form of submissive gesture to signify \\"Yes\\".  Manual vs. non-manual communicative gestures  Within the realm of communicative gestures, the first distinction to be made is between gestures made with the hands and arms, and gestures made with other parts of the body. Examples of Non-manual gestures may include head nodding and shaking, shoulder shrugging, and facial expression, among others. Non-manual gestures are attested in languages all around the world, but have not been the primary focus of most research regarding co-speech gesture. = Manual gestures = A gesture that is a form of communication in which bodily actions communicate particular messages. Manual gestures are most commonly broken down into four distinct categories: Symbolic (Emblematic), Deictic (Indexical), Motor (Beat), and Lexical (Iconic) It is important to note that manual gesture in the sense of communicative co- speech gesture does not include the gesture-signs of Sign Languages, even though sign language is communicative and primarily produced using the hands, because the gestures in Sign Language are not used to intensify or modify the speech produced by the vocal tract, rather they communicate fully productive language through a method alternative to the vocal tract.  Symbolic (emblematic)  The most familiar are the so-called emblems or quotable gestures. These are conventional, culture-specific gestures that can be used as replacement for words, such as the handwave used in the US for \\"hello\\" and \\"goodbye\\". A single emblematic gesture can have a very different significance in different cultural contexts, ranging from complimentary to highly offensive.Morris, Desmond, Collett, Peter, Marsh, Peter, O'Shaughnessy, Marie. 1979. Gestures, their origins and distribution. London. Cape The page List of gestures discusses emblematic gestures made with one hand, two hands, hand and other body parts, and body and facial gestures. Symbolic gestures can occur either concurrently or independently of vocal speech. Symbolic gestures are iconic gestures that are widely recognized, fixed, and have conventionalized meanings.  Deictic (indexical)  Deictic gestures can occur simultaneously with vocal speech or in place of it. Deictic gestures are gestures that consist of indicative or pointing motions. These gestures often work in the same way as demonstrative words and pronouns like \\"this\\" or \\"that\\". Deictic gestures can refer to concrete or intangible objects or people. Motor (beat) Motor or beat gestures usually consist of short, repetitive, rhythmic movements that are closely tied with prosody in verbal speech. Unlike symbolic and deictic gestures, beat gestures cannot occur independently of verbal speech and convey no semantic information. For example, some people wave their hands as they speak to emphasize a certain word or phrase. These gestures are closely coordinated with speech. The so- called beat gestures are used in conjunction with speech and keep time with the rhythm of speech to emphasize certain words or phrases. These types of gestures are integrally connected to speech and thought processes. Lexical (iconic) Other spontaneous gestures used during speech production known as iconic gestures are more full of content, and may echo, or elaborate, the meaning of the co-occurring speech. They depict aspects of spatial images, actions, people, or objects. For example, a gesture that depicts the act of throwing may be synchronous with the utterance, \\"He threw the ball right into the window.\\"McNeill (1992). Hand and Mind. Chicago: University of Chicago Press Such gestures that are used along with speech tend to be universal. For example, one describing that he/she is feeling cold due to a lack of proper clothing and/or a cold weather can accompany his/her verbal description with a visual one. This can be achieved through various gestures such as by demonstrating a shiver and/or by rubbing the hands together. In such cases, the language or verbal description of the person does not necessarily need to be understood as someone could at least take a hint at what's being communicated through the observation and interpretation of body language which serves as a gesture equivalent in meaning to what's being said through communicative speech. The elaboration of lexical gestures falls on a spectrum of iconic-metaphorical in how closely tied they are to the lexico-semantic content of the verbal speech they coordinate with. More iconic gesture very obviously mirrors the words being spoken (such as drawing a jagged horizontal line in the air to describe mountains) whereas more metaphorical gestures clearly contain some spatial relation to the semantic content of the co- occurring verbal speech, but the relationship between the gesture and the speech might be more ambiguous. Lexical gestures, like motor gestures, cannot occur independently of verbal speech. The purpose of lexical gestures is still widely contested in the literature with some linguists arguing that lexical gestures serve to amplify or modulate the semantic content of lexical speech, or that it serves a cognitive purpose in aiding in lexical access and retrieval or verbal working memory. Most recent research suggests that lexical gestures serve a primarily socio-pragmatic role. Language development Studies affirm a strong link between gesture typology and language development. Young children under the age of two seem to rely on pointing gestures to refer to objects that they do not know the names of. Once the words are learned, they eschewed those referential (pointing) gestures. One would think that the use of gesture would decrease as the child develops spoken language, but results reveal that gesture frequency increased as speaking frequency increased with age. There is, however, a change in gesture typology at different ages, suggesting a connection between gestures and language development. Children most often use pointing and adults rely more on iconic and beat gestures. As children begin producing sentence-like utterances, they also begin producing new kinds of gestures that adults use when speaking (iconics and beats). Evidence of this systematic organization of gesture is indicative of its association to language development. Gestural languages such as American Sign Language and its regional siblings operate as complete natural languages that are gestural in modality. They should not be confused with finger spelling, in which a set of emblematic gestures are used to represent a written alphabet. American sign language is different from gesturing in that concepts are modeled by certain hand motions or expressions and has a specific established structure while gesturing is more malleable and has no specific structure rather it supplements speech. Before an established sign language was created in Nicaragua after the 1970s, deaf communities would use \\"home signs\\" in order to communicate with each other. These home signs were not part of a unified language but were still used as familiar motions and expressions used within their family‚Äîstill closely related to language rather than gestures with no specific structure. This is similar to what has been observed in the gestural actions of chimpanzees. Gestures are used by these animals in place of verbal language, which is restricted in animals due to their lacking certain physiological and articulation abilities that humans have for speech. Corballis (2009) asserts that \\"our hominid ancestors were better pre-adapted to acquire language-like competence using manual gestures than using vocal sounds.\\" This leads to a debate about whether humans, too, looked to gestures first as their modality of language in the early existence of the species. The function of gestures may have been a significant player in the evolution of language. Social significance Gesturing is probably universal; there has been no report of a community that does not gesture. Gestures are a crucial part of everyday conversation such as chatting, describing a route, negotiating prices on a market; they are ubiquitous.Axtell, R. (1993). Do's and taboos around the world. (3rd ed., p. 116). Wiley. Retrieved from http://www.sheltonstate.edu/Uploads/files/faculty/Angela%20Gibson/Sph%20106/taboos0001.pdf Gestures are learned embodied cultural practices that can function as a way to interpret ethnic, gender, and sexual identity. Gestures, commonly referred to as \\"body language,\\" play an important role in industry. Proper body language etiquette in business dealings can be crucial for success. However, gestures can have different meanings according to the country in which they are expressed. In an age of global business, diplomatic cultural sensitivity has become a necessity. Gestures that we take as innocent may be seen by someone else as deeply insulting. The following gestures are examples of proper etiquette with respect to different countries‚Äô customs on salutations: * In the United States, \\"a firm handshake, accompanied by direct eye contact, is the standard greeting. Direct eye contact in both social and business situations is very important.\\"Morris, Desmond. Bodytalk: a World Guide to Gestures. Jonathan Cape, 1995. * In the People's Republic of China, \\"the Western custom of shaking a person's hand upon introduction has become widespread throughout the country. However, oftentimes a nod of the head or a slight bow will suffice.\\" * In Japan, \\"the act of presenting business cards is very important. When presenting, one holds the business card with both hands, grasping it between the thumbs and forefingers. The presentation is to be accompanied by a slight bow. The print on the card should point towards the person to which one is giving the card.\\" * In Germany, \\"it is impolite to shake someone's hand with your other hand in your pocket. This is seen as a sign of disrespect\\". * In France, \\"a light, quick handshake is common. To offer a strong, pumping handshake would be considered uncultured. When one enters a room, be sure to greet each person present. A woman in France will offer her hand first.\\"Axtell, R. (1993). Worldsmart: Gestures around the world. World Smart Resource Center, Retrieved from http://www.globalbusinessleadership.com/gestures_overview.asp Vitarka Vicara, Tarim Basin, 9th century. In Hinduism and Buddhism, a mudra (Sanskrit, literally \\"seal\\") is a symbolic gesture made with the hand or fingers. Each mudra has a specific meaning, playing a central role in Hindu and Buddhist iconography. A common religious gesture include crossing oneself in a number of Christian religions as a sign of respect, typically by kneeling before a sacred object in many.VASC, Dermina, and Thea IONESCU. \\"Embodying Cognition: Gestures And Their Role In The Development Of Thinking.\\" Cognitie, Creier, Comportament/Cognition, Brain, Behavior 17.2 (2013): 149-150. Academic Search Complete. Web. Gestures play a central role in religious or spiritual rituals such as the Christian sign of the cross. Gestures are also a means to initiate a mating ritual. This may include elaborate dances and other movements. Gestures play a major role in many aspects of human life. Gesturing is probably universal; there has been no report of a community that does not gesture. Gestures are a crucial part of everyday conversation such as chatting, describing a route, negotiating prices on a market; they are ubiquitous. Additionally, when people use gestures, there is a certain shared background knowledge. Different cultures use similar gestures when talking about a specific action such as how we gesture the idea of drinking out of a cup. When an individual makes a gesture, another person can understand because of recognition of the actions/shapes. Gestures have been documented in the arts such as in Greek vase paintings, Indian Miniatures or European paintings. An example, Vitarka Vicara, the gesture of discussion and transmission of Buddhist teaching. It is done by joining the tips of the thumb and the index together, while keeping the other fingers straight. Neurology Gestures are processed in the same areas of the brain as speech and sign language such as the left inferior frontal gyrus (Broca's area) and the posterior middle temporal gyrus, posterior superior temporal sulcus and superior temporal gyrus (Wernicke's area). It has been suggested that these parts of the brain originally supported the pairing of gesture and meaning and then were adapted in human evolution \\"for the comparable pairing of sound and meaning as voluntary control over the vocal apparatus was established and spoken language evolved\\". As a result, it underlies both symbolic gesture and spoken language in the present human brain. Their common neurological basis also supports the idea that symbolic gesture and spoken language are two parts of a single fundamental semiotic system that underlies human discourse. The linkage of hand and body gestures in conjunction with speech is further revealed by the nature of gesture use in blind individuals during conversation. This phenomenon uncovers a function of gesture that goes beyond portraying communicative content of language and extends David McNeill's view of the gesture-speech system. This suggests that gesture and speech work tightly together, and a disruption of one (speech or gesture) will cause a problem in the other. Studies have found strong evidence that speech and gesture are innately linked in the brain and work in an efficiently wired and choreographed system. McNeill's view of this linkage in the brain is just one of three currently up for debate; the others declaring gesture to be a \\"support system\\" of spoken language or a physical mechanism for lexical retrieval. Because of this connection of co-speech gestures‚Äîa form of manual action‚Äîin language in the brain, Roel Willems and Peter Hagoort conclude that both gestures and language contribute to the understanding and decoding of a speaker's encoded message. Willems and Hagoort's research suggest that \\"processing evoked by gestures is qualitatively similar to that of words at the level of semantic processing.\\" This conclusion is supported through findings from experiments by Skipper where the use of gestures led to \\"a division of labor between areas related to language or action (Broca's area and premotor/primary motor cortex respectively)\\", The use of gestures in combination with speech allowed the brain to decrease the need for \\"semantic control\\", Because gestures aided in understanding the relayed message, there was not as great a need for semantic selection or control that would otherwise be required of the listener through Broca's area. Gestures are a way to represent the thoughts of an individual, which are prompted in working memory. The results of an experiment revealed that adults have increased accuracy when they used pointing gestures as opposed to simply counting in their heads (without the use of pointing gestures) Furthermore, the results of a study conducted by Marstaller and Burianov√° suggest that the use of gestures affect working memory. The researchers found that those with low capacity of working memory who were able to use gestures actually recalled more terms than those with low capacity who were not able to use gestures. Although there is an obvious connection in the aid of gestures in understanding a message, \\"the understanding of gestures is not the same as understanding spoken language.\\" These two functions work together and gestures help facilitate understanding, but they only \\"partly drive the neural language system\\". Electronic interface The movement of gestures can be used to interact with technology like computers, using touch or multi-touch popularised by the iPhone, physical movement detection and visual motion capture, used in video game consoles. It can be recorded using kinematic methodology.  Kendon's continuum  In order to better understand the linguistic values that gestures hold, Adam Kendon, a pioneer in gesture research has proposed to look at it as a continuum from less linguistic to fully linguistic. Using the continuum, speech declines as \\"the language-like properties of gestural behaviors increase and idiosyncratic gestures are replaced by socially regulated signs\\". Gestures of different kinds fall within this continuum and include spontaneous gesticulations, language-like gestures, pantomime, emblems, and sign language. Spontaneous gesticulations are not evident without the presence of speech, assisting in the process of vocalization, whereas language-like gestures are \\"iconic and metaphoric, but lack consistency and are context-dependent\\". \\"Language-like gesture\\" implies that the gesture is assuming something linguistic (Loncke, 2013). Pantomime falls in the middle of the continuum and requires shared conventions. This kind of gesture helps convey information or describe an event. Following pantomime are emblems, which have specific meanings to denote \\"feelings, obscenities, and insults\\" and are not required to be used in conjunction with speech. The most linguistic gesture on Kendon's continuum is sign language, where \\"single manual signs have specific meanings and are combined with other manual signs according to specific rules\\".

It advocates an unconditional basic income and emphasizes its anti-militarism. History A group of Dutch environmentalists led by Marten Bierman founded The Greens on 17 December 1983. They entered the European elections under the name \\"European Greens\\" since the name \\"The Greens\\" was controlled by Bas de Gaay Fortman. The party's foundation was supported by the Francophone Belgian green party Ecolo, while the German Greens supported the Green Progressive Accord. The party became involved in the formation of the Coordination of European Green Parties. It won 1.3% of vote in the 1984 European parliament election below the threshold of 4% for a seat. For the 1986 national elections the party used now the name \\"The Greens\\" which was abandoned. With Marten Bierman as top- candidate it won 0.2% of the votes, below the threshold of 0.7% for a seat. The party had a federal structure consisting of provincial parties. In 1987 The Greens participated in the North Holland, South Holland and Gelderland provincial elections. They won one seat on the States of North Holland, partially because of the support of Green Amsterdam led by Roel van Duijn. On March 10, 1989 Green Amsterdam merged with The Greens. In 1989 GroenLinks was formed by a merger of PPR, PSP, CPN and the Christian left Evangelical People's Party. The Greens rejected to join the merger because it emphasised social-economic issues too much and environmental issues too little. Independently, they participated in the 1989 elections with Roel van Duijn as their top candidate. The party won 0.35% of votes, below the threshold. The party abandoned its federal structure in 1992. For the Dutch general election of 1994, GroenLinks proposed a candidate chosen by The Greens on place 10 on their list, but this was rejected by The Green's Congress. The party entered the election with Hein Westerouen van Meeteren as top-candidate and won 0.2% of vote. In the 1994 municipal elections the party expanded its number of seats and won seats in Leiden, Nijmegen, Zwolle and Amsterdam. In 1991 GroenLinks MEP Herman Verbeek left his party and continued as an independent. He became a member of The Greens in 1994 and led their European list in the European Parliament election. The party won 2.36% of vote, below the threshold. In 1995 the party contested several provincial elections. It won seats in North Holland and South Holland (on a combined GroenLinks/The Greens list). The party cooperated with several provincial parties to form a common list for the indirect elections for the Senate by the States-Provincial. The first seat was taken by the \\"Federation of Frisian Municipal-interest Parties\\" and the second by Marten Bierman. Bierman was elected by preference votes. He formed a separate Independent Senate Fraction, a novelty in Dutch politics. Before no group had previously had representation in the Senate without also being present in the House of Representatives. In the 1998 elections the party participated with Jaap Dirkmaat as top-candidate and won 0.2% of the votes. The party did keep its seats in municipal councils and expanded to Haarlem, Zeist, Arnhem, Groningen and Haren. The Greens have not participated in the Dutch general elections since 1998. The party received 0.19% of the vote in the European elections of 2009 and 0.23% of the vote in the European elections of 2014. By 2017 the party was split into two conflicting groups both claiming legitimacy with the total party membership being 33. One faction held a congress with 10 attendees which elected Otto ter Haar party leader.https://europeangreens.eu/sites/europeangreens.eu/files/Annex%201%20Report%20scouting%20mission%20to%20Netherlands%20De%20Groenen%2017%20March%202017_0.pdf,  House of Representatives  The Greens participated between 1986 and 1998 four times in the general elections. The head of lists were Marten Bierman (1986), Roel van Duijn (1989), Hein Westerouen van Meeteren (1994) and Jaap Dirkmaat (1998). The party failed to pass the threshold of 0,67 percent: * 1986 Dutch general election: 18.641 votes (0,20 percent) * 1989 Dutch general election: 31.312 votes (0,35 percent) * 1994 Dutch general election: 13.902 votes (0,15 percent) * 1998 Dutch general election: 16.585 votes (0,19 percent) Since 1998 the party refrained from participating in the general elections.

Each trou de loup consisted of a conical pit about deep and wide at the top. At the bottom of the pit, a sharpened punji stick (wooden stake) would be hammered in. In some cases, the pit was concealed by light cover of wicker and a layer of soil. Trous de loup might be found singly as a trap (in which case they were always concealed), or in a dense pattern with no gaps between pits, used as an obstacle in front of a defended position. A field of trous de loup could be made most effective if subsequently flooded to a shallow depth, which would conceal the pits, make their sides slippery, and add the risk of drowning. Sometimes rotting meat or feces would be smeared onto the points to cause serious infection and quite often death. History Even though the term has a medieval origin, this kind of device was first described by Julius Caesar, in the seventh book of his Commentarii de Bello Gallico (Commentaries on the Gallic Wars), who employed the device during the siege of Alesia. Caesar writes they were called lilies for their resemblance to the flower of the same name.C. Julius Caesar. Commentarii de Bello Gallico book VII, chapter 73.

History  The pinnacle of this division's service was during World War II, during the German invasion of Norway. It was commanded by General Carl Gustav Fleischer,Lunde, (2010), p. 132. who was one of the King of Norway's favourite military officers. His division was one of the few Norwegian military commands that was battle ready on 9 April 1940 when the Germans invaded. With help from British, French, and Polish forces, 6th Division were able to recapture the city of Narvik, during what became known as the Battle of Narvik.Mann & J√∂rgensen, 2003, p. 59. The Germans took the city at the beginning of the battle, but it was retaken 28 May, in what became known as the first major victory for the Allies in World War II. However, the successful German attack on France forced the Allied task force to evacuate, which they did in June. As a result of the withdrawal of allied air and naval support the Norwegians were forced to lay down their arms and demobilize. In one of the most controversial episodes in history of Norway's role in World War II General Fleischer ended his life in 1942, after being sent to Canada as the Norwegian military attach√©, a role that was basically a demotion. After the demobilisation, 6th Division was disbanded. However, when Norway was liberated in 1945, the division was immediately re-established. One long-term consequence of the action at Narvik was the close cooperation between the British military and Norwegian Army, along with close cooperation with France's alpine forces. During the Cold War the division fought in no conflicts. After the end of the Cold War the 6th was re-organized in 2002, as part of an overall reform of the Norwegian military.  Final organisation  In its peacetime organisation, 6th Division consisted of approximately 1,200 commissioned and non-commissioned officers (COs and NCOs), with approximately 3,000 enlisted soldiers and 200 civilian support staff. In wartime, its numbers could exceed 12,000 in total. Being the only division in the Norwegian Army, the 6th utilised a wide range of modern combat equipment. Its heaviest weapons included Leopard 2A4NO MBTs, CV9030 IFVs and modernized M109A3GN howitzers. The infantry use Bv206 tracked all-terrain vehicles, snowmobiles and light off-road vehicles. Their airlifting capabilities were provided by the Tactical Helicopter Group of the Royal Norwegian Air Force, which is stationed at Bardufoss. The division's motto is \\"Styrke for fred, evne til strid\\", or \\"Strength for peace, capability for war\\".

Smith, Dick Scobee, Ronald McNair; (back row) Ellison Onizuka, Christa McAuliffe, Gregory Jarvis, Judith Resnik The Space Shuttle Challenger disaster was a fatal incident in the United States space program that occurred on January 28, 1986, when the (OV-099) broke apart 73 seconds into its flight, killing all seven crew members aboard. The crew consisted of five NASA astronauts, and two payload specialists. The mission carried the designation STS-51-L and was the tenth flight for the Challenger orbiter. The spacecraft disintegrated over the Atlantic Ocean, off the coast of Cape Canaveral, Florida, at 11:39a.m. EST (16:39 UTC). The disintegration of the vehicle began after a joint in its right solid rocket booster (SRB) failed at liftoff. The failure was caused by the failure of O-ring seals used in the joint that were not designed to handle the unusually cold conditions that existed at this launch. The seals' failure caused a breach in the SRB joint, allowing pressurized burning gas from within the solid rocket motor to reach the outside and impinge upon the adjacent SRB aft field joint attachment hardware and external fuel tank. This led to the separation of the right-hand SRB's aft field joint attachment and the structural failure of the external tank. Aerodynamic forces broke up the orbiter. The crew compartment and many other vehicle fragments were eventually recovered from the ocean floor after a lengthy search and recovery operation. The exact timing of the death of the crew is unknown; several crew members are known to have survived the initial breakup of the spacecraft. The shuttle had no escape system, and the impact of the crew compartment at terminal velocity with the ocean surface was too violent to be survivable. The disaster resulted in a 32-month hiatus in the Space Shuttle program and the formation of the Rogers Commission, a special commission appointed by United States President Ronald Reagan to investigate the accident. The Rogers Commission found that NASA's organizational culture and decision-making processes had been key contributing factors to the accident, with the agency violating its own safety rules. NASA managers had known since 1977 that contractor Morton-Thiokol's design of the SRBs contained a potentially catastrophic flaw in the O-rings, but they had failed to address this problem properly. NASA managers also disregarded warnings from engineers about the dangers of launching posed by the low temperatures of that morning, and failed to adequately report these technical concerns to their superiors. Approximately 17 percent of the American population witnessed the launch on live television broadcast because of the presence of high school teacher Christa McAuliffe, who would have been the first teacher in space. Media coverage of the accident was extensive; one study reported that 85 percent of Americans surveyed had heard the news within an hour of the accident. The Challenger disaster has been used as a case study in many discussions of engineering safety and workplace ethics. O-ring concerns Challenger being carried atop a Crawler-transporter on the way to the launch pad Each of the two solid rocket boosters (SRBs) was constructed of seven sections, six of which were permanently joined in pairs at the factory. For each flight, the four resulting segments were then assembled in the Vehicle Assembly Building at Kennedy Space Center (KSC), with three field joints. The factory joints were sealed with asbestos-silica insulation applied over the joint, while each field joint was sealed with two rubber O-rings. After the destruction of Challenger, the number of O-rings per field joint was increased to three. The seals of all of the SRB joints were required to contain the hot, high-pressure gases produced by the burning solid propellant inside, thus forcing them out of the nozzle at the aft end of each rocket. During the Space Shuttle design process, a McDonnell Douglas report in September 1971 discussed the safety record of solid rockets. While a safe abort was possible after most types of failures, one was especially dangerous: a burnthrough by hot gases of the rocket's casing. The report stated that \\"if burnthrough occurs adjacent to [liquid hydrogen/oxygen] tank or orbiter, timely sensing may not be feasible and abort not possible\\", accurately foreshadowing the Challenger accident. Morton-Thiokol was the contractor responsible for the construction and maintenance of the shuttle's SRBs. As originally designed by Thiokol, the O-ring joints in the SRBs were supposed to close more tightly due to forces generated at ignition, but a 1977 test showed that when pressurized water was used to simulate the effects of booster combustion, the metal parts bent away from each other, opening a gap through which gases could leak. This phenomenon, known as \\"joint rotation\\", caused a momentary drop in air pressure. This made it possible for combustion gases to erode the O-rings. In the event of widespread erosion, a flame path could develop, causing the joint to burst‚Äîwhich would have destroyed the booster and the shuttle. Engineers at the Marshall Space Flight Center wrote to the manager of the Solid Rocket Booster project, George Hardy, on several occasions suggesting that Thiokol's field joint design was unacceptable. For example, one engineer suggested that joint rotation would render the secondary O-ring useless, but Hardy did not forward these memos to Thiokol, and the field joints were accepted for flight in 1980. Evidence of serious O-ring erosion was present as early as the second space shuttle mission, STS-2, which was flown by Columbia. Contrary to NASA regulations, the Marshall Center did not report this problem to senior management at NASA, but opted to keep the problem within their reporting channels with Thiokol. Even after the O-rings were redesignated as \\"Criticality 1\\"‚Äîmeaning that their failure would result in the destruction of the Orbiter, no one at Marshall suggested that the shuttles be grounded until the flaw could be fixed. After the 1984 launch of STS-41-D, flown by Discovery, the first occurrence of hot gas \\"blow-by\\" was discovered beyond the primary O-ring. In the post-flight analysis, Thiokol engineers found that the amount of blow-by was relatively small and had not impinged upon the secondary O-ring, and concluded that for future flights, the damage was an acceptable risk. However, after the Challenger disaster, Thiokol engineer Brian Russell identified this event as the first \\"big red flag\\" regarding O-ring safety. By 1985, with seven of nine shuttle launches that year using boosters displaying O-ring erosion or hot gas blow-by, Marshall and Thiokol realized that they had a potentially catastrophic problem on their hands. Perhaps most concerning was the launch of STS-51-B in April 1985, flown by Challenger, in which the worst O-ring damage to date was discovered in post-flight analysis. The primary O-ring of the left nozzle had been eroded so extensively that it had failed to seal, and for the first time hot gases had eroded the secondary O-ring. They began the process of redesigning the joint with three inches (76 mm) of additional steel around the tang. This tang would grip the inner face of the joint and prevent it from rotating. They did not call for a halt to shuttle flights until the joints could be redesigned, but rather treated the problem as an acceptable flight risk. For example, Lawrence Mulloy, Marshall's manager for the SRB project since 1982, issued and waived launch constraints for six consecutive flights. Thiokol even went as far as to persuade NASA to declare the O-ring problem \\"closed\\". Donald Kutyna, a member of the Rogers Commission, later likened this situation to an airline permitting one of its planes to continue to fly despite evidence that one of its wings was about to fall off. Pre-launch conditions =Delays= Challenger was originally set to launch from Kennedy Space Center in Florida at 14:42 Eastern Standard Time (EST) on Wednesday, January 22, 1986. Delays in the previous mission, STS-61-C, caused the launch date to be moved to January 23 and then to January 24. The launch was rescheduled again, to Saturday, January 25, due to bad weather at the transoceanic abort landing (TAL) site in Dakar, Senegal. NASA decided to use the TAL site at Casablanca, Morocco, but because it was not equipped for night landings, the launch had to be moved to the morning. Predictions of unacceptable weather at Kennedy Space Center on January 26 caused the launch to be rescheduled for 09:37 EST on Monday, January 27. The planned January 27 launch was initially delayed due to problems with the exterior access hatch. First, a micro-switch indicator malfunctioned. Its purpose was to verify that the orbiter's hatch was safely locked. Then, a stripped bolt prevented the closeout crew from removing a closing fixture from the hatch. By the time repair personnel had sawed off the fixture, crosswinds at the Shuttle Landing Facility exceeded the limits for a return-to-launch-site abort. While the crew waited for the winds to die down, the launch window expired, forcing yet another scrub. =Thiokol‚ÄìNASA conference call= Forecasts for January 28 predicted an unusually cold morning, with temperatures close to , the minimum temperature permitted for launch. The Shuttle was never certified to operate in temperatures that low. The O-rings, as well as many other critical components, had no test data to support any expectation of a successful launch in such conditions. By mid-1985 Thiokol engineers worried that others did not share their concerns about the low temperature effects on the boosters. Engineer Bob Ebeling in October 1985 wrote a memo‚Äîtitled \\"Help!\\" so others would read it‚Äîof concerns regarding low temperatures and O-rings. After the weather forecast, NASA personnel remembered Thiokol's warnings and contacted the company. When a Thiokol manager asked Ebeling about the possibility of a launch at , he answered \\"[W]e're only qualified to 40¬∞ []... 'what business does anyone even have thinking about 18¬∞, we're in no-man's land.'\\" After his team agreed that a launch risked disaster, Thiokol immediately called NASA recommending a postponement until temperatures rose in the afternoon. NASA manager Jud Lovingood responded that Thiokol could not make the recommendation without providing a safe temperature. The company prepared for a teleconference two hours later during which it would have to justify a no- launch recommendation. At the teleconference on the evening of January 27, Thiokol engineers and managers discussed the weather conditions with NASA managers from Kennedy Space Center and Marshall Space Flight Center. Several engineers (most notably Allan McDonald, Ebeling and Roger Boisjoly) reiterated their concerns about the effect of low temperatures on the resilience of the rubber O-rings that sealed the joints of the SRBs, and recommended a launch postponement. They argued that they did not have enough data to determine whether the joints would properly seal if the O-rings were colder than . This was an important consideration, since the SRB O-rings had been designated as a \\"Criticality 1\\" component, meaning that there was no backup if both the primary and secondary O-rings failed, and their failure could destroy the Orbiter and kill its crew. Thiokol management initially supported its engineers' recommendation to postpone the launch, but NASA staff opposed a delay. During the conference call, Hardy told Thiokol, \\"I am appalled. I am appalled by your recommendation.\\" Mulloy said, \\"My God, Thiokol, when do you want me to launch‚Äînext April?\\" NASA believed that Thiokol's hastily prepared presentation's quality was too poor to support such a statement on flight safety. One argument by NASA personnel contesting Thiokol's concerns was that if the primary O-ring failed, the secondary O-ring would still seal. This was unproven, and was in any case an argument that did not apply to a \\"Criticality 1\\" component. As astronaut Sally Ride stated when questioning NASA managers before the Rogers Commission, it is forbidden to rely on a backup for a \\"Criticality 1\\" component. NASA claimed that it did not know of Thiokol's earlier concerns about the effects of the cold on the O-rings, and did not understand that Rockwell International, the shuttle's prime contractor, additionally viewed the large amount of ice present on the pad as a constraint to launch. According to Ebeling, a second conference call was scheduled with only NASA and Thiokol management, excluding the engineers. For reasons that are unclear, Thiokol management disregarded its own engineers' warnings and now recommended that the launch proceed as scheduled; NASA did not ask why. Ebeling told his wife that night that Challenger would blow up. Ken Iliff, a former NASA Chief Scientist who had worked on the Space Shuttle program since its first mission (and the X-15 program before that), stated this in 2004: =Ice= Ice on the launch tower hours before Challenger launch The Thiokol engineers had also argued that the low overnight temperatures of projected on the day prior to launch would almost certainly result in SRB temperatures below their redline of . Ice had accumulated all over the launch pad, raising concerns that ice could damage the shuttle upon lift-off. The Kennedy Ice Team inadvertently pointed an infrared camera at the aft field joint of the right SRB and found the temperature to be only . This was believed to be the result of supercooled air blowing on the joint from the liquid oxygen (LOX) tank vent. It was much lower than the air temperature and far below the design specifications for the O-rings. The low reading was later determined to be erroneous, the error caused by not following the temperature probe manufacturer's instructions. Tests and adjusted calculations later confirmed that the temperature of the joint was not substantially different from the ambient temperature. The temperature on the day of the launch was far lower than had been the case with previous launches: below freezing at ; previously, the coldest launch had been at . Although the Ice Team had worked through the night removing ice, engineers at Rockwell still expressed concern. Rockwell engineers watching the pad from their headquarters in Downey, California, were horrified when they saw the amount of ice. They feared that during launch, ice might be shaken loose and strike the shuttle's thermal protection tiles, possibly due to the aspiration induced by the jet of exhaust gas from the SRBs. Rocco Petrone, the head of Rockwell's space transportation division, and his colleagues viewed this situation as a launch constraint, and told Rockwell's managers at the Cape that Rockwell could not support a launch. Rockwell's managers at the Cape voiced their concerns in a manner that led Houston-based mission manager Arnold Aldrich to go ahead with the launch. Aldrich decided to postpone the shuttle launch by an hour to give the Ice Team time to perform another inspection. After that last inspection, during which the ice appeared to be melting, Challenger was cleared to launch at 11:38 am EST. January 28 launch and failure =Liftoff and initial ascent= Gray smoke escaping from the right-side solid rocket booster The following account of the accident is derived from real time telemetry data and photographic analysis, as well as from transcripts of air-to-ground and mission control voice communications.A major source for information about the Challenger accident is the STS 51-L Incident Integrated Events Timeline developed by the NASA Photo and TV Support Team as part of the Rogers Report. Numerous other timelines have been written based on this information. A detailed transcript of air-to-ground and mission control voice communications was put together by journalists Rob Navias and William Harwood, integrating a timeline of events: All times are given in seconds after launch and correspond to the telemetry time-codes from the closest instrumented event to each described event. The Space Shuttle main engines (SSMEs) were ignited at T -6.6 seconds. The SSMEs were liquid-fueled and could be safely shut down (and the launch aborted if necessary) until the solid rocket boosters (SRBs) ignited at T=0 (which was at 11:38:00.010 EST) and the hold-down bolts were released with explosives, freeing the vehicle from the pad. At lift off, the three SSMEs were at 100% of their original rated performance, and began throttling up to 104% under computer control. With the first vertical motion of the vehicle, the gaseous hydrogen vent arm retracted from the external tank (ET) but failed to latch back. Review of film shot by pad cameras showed that the arm did not re- contact the vehicle, and thus it was ruled out as a contributing factor in the accident. The post-launch inspection of the pad also revealed that kick springs on four of the hold-down bolts were missing, but they were similarly ruled out as a possible cause. Challenger launch and breakup Later review of launch film showed that at T+0.678, strong puffs of dark gray smoke were emitted from the right-hand SRB near the aft strut that attached the booster to the ET. The last smoke puff occurred at about T+2.733. The last view of smoke around the strut was at T+3.375. It was later determined that these smoke puffs were caused by the opening and closing of the aft field joint of the right-hand SRB. The booster's casing had ballooned under the stress of ignition. As a result of this ballooning, the metal parts of the casing bent away from each other, opening a gap through which hot gases‚Äîabove ‚Äîleaked. This had occurred in previous launches, but each time the primary O-ring had shifted out of its groove and formed a seal. Although the SRB was not designed to function this way, it appeared to work well enough, and Morton-Thiokol changed the design specs to accommodate this process, known as extrusion. While extrusion was taking place, hot gases leaked past (a process called \\"blow-by\\"), damaging the O-rings until a seal was made. Investigations by Morton-Thiokol engineers determined that the amount of damage to the O-rings was directly related to the time it took for extrusion to occur, and that cold weather, by causing the O-rings to harden, lengthened the time of extrusion. The redesigned SRB field joint used subsequent to the Challenger accident used an additional interlocking mortise and tang with a third O-ring, mitigating blow-by. On the morning of the disaster, the primary O-ring had become so hard due to the cold that it could not seal in time. The temperature had dropped below the glass transition temperature of the O-rings. Above the glass transition temperature, the O-rings display properties of elasticity and flexibility, while below the glass transition temperature, they become rigid and brittle. The secondary O-ring was not in its seated position due to the metal bending. There was now no barrier to the gases, and both O-rings were vaporized across 70 degrees of arc. Aluminum oxides from the burned solid propellant sealed the damaged joint, temporarily replacing the O-ring seal before flame passed through the joint. As the vehicle cleared the tower, the SSMEs were operating at 104% of their rated maximum thrust, and control switched from the Launch Control Center (LCC) at Kennedy to the Mission Control Center (MCC) at Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. To prevent aerodynamic forces from structurally overloading the orbiter, at T+28 the SSMEs began throttling down to limit the velocity of the shuttle in the dense lower atmosphere, per normal operating procedure. At T+35.379, the SSMEs throttled back further to the planned 65%. Five seconds later, at about , Challenger passed through Mach 1. At T+51.860, the SSMEs began throttling back up to 104% as the vehicle passed beyond max q, the period of maximum aerodynamic pressure on the vehicle. =Plume= Plume on right SRB at T+ 58.788 seconds Beginning at about T+37 and for 27 seconds, the shuttle experienced a series of wind shear events that were stronger than on any previous flight. At T+58.788, a tracking film camera captured the beginnings of a plume near the aft attach strut on the right SRB. Unknown to those on Challenger or in Houston, hot gas had begun to leak through a growing hole in one of the right-hand SRB joints. The force of the wind shear shattered the temporary oxide seal that had taken the place of the damaged O-rings, removing the last barrier to flame passing through the joint. Had it not been for the wind shear, the fortuitous oxide seal might have held through booster burnout. Within a second, the plume became well defined and intense. Internal pressure in the right SRB began to drop because of the rapidly enlarging hole in the failed joint, and at T+60.238 there was visual evidence of flame burning through the joint and impinging on the external tank. At T+64.660, the plume suddenly changed shape, indicating that a leak had begun in the liquid hydrogen (LH2) tank, located in the aft portion of the external tank. The nozzles of the main engines pivoted under computer control to compensate for the unbalanced thrust produced by the booster burn-through. The pressure in the shuttle's external LH2 tank began to drop at T+66.764, indicating the effect of the leak. At this stage the situation still seemed normal both to the crew and to flight controllers. At T+68, the CAPCOM Richard O. Covey informed the crew that they were \\"go at throttle up\\", and Commander Dick Scobee confirmed, \\"Roger, go at throttle up\\"; this was the last communication from Challenger on the air-to-ground loop. =Vehicle breakup= A tracking camera located north of the pad captured the SRB plume as it burned through the external tank. The damaged SRB was seen exiting the vapor cloud with clear signs of O-ring failure on one of its segments. Challenger begins to disintegrate At T+72.284, the right SRB pulled away from the aft strut attaching it to the external tank. Later analysis of telemetry data showed a sudden lateral acceleration to the right at T+72.525, which may have been felt by the crew. The last statement captured by the crew cabin recorder came just half a second after this acceleration, when Pilot Michael J. Smith said, \\"Uh- oh.\\" Smith may also have been responding to onboard indications of main engine performance, or to falling pressures in the external fuel tank. At T+73.124, the aft dome of the liquid hydrogen tank failed, producing a propulsive force that rammed the hydrogen tank into the LOX tank in the forward part of the ET. At the same time, the right SRB rotated about the forward attach strut, and struck the intertank structure. The external tank at this point suffered a complete structural failure, the LH2 and LOX tanks rupturing, mixing, and igniting, creating a fireball that enveloped the whole stack. The breakup of the vehicle began at T+73.162 seconds and at an altitude of . With the external tank disintegrating (and with the semi-detached right SRB contributing its thrust on an anomalous vector), Challenger veered from its correct attitude with respect to the local airflow, resulting in a load factor of up to 20 g, well over its design limit of 5g and was quickly ripped apart by abnormal aerodynamic forces (the orbiter did not explode as is often suggested, as the force of the external tank breakup was well within its structural limits). The two SRBs, which could withstand greater aerodynamic loads, separated from the ET and continued in uncontrolled powered flight. The SRB casings were made of half-inch-thick (12.7 mm) steel and were much stronger than the orbiter and ET; thus, both SRBs survived the breakup of the space shuttle stack, even though the right SRB was still suffering the effects of the joint burn-through that had set the destruction of Challenger in motion. The more robustly constructed crew cabin also survived the breakup of the launch vehicle, as it was designed to survive while the estimated pressure it had been subjected to during orbiter breakup was only about . While the SRBs were subsequently destroyed remotely by the Range Safety Officer, the detached cabin continued along a ballistic trajectory and was observed exiting the cloud of gases at T+75.237. Twenty-five seconds after the breakup of the vehicle, the altitude of the crew compartment peaked at a height of . The cabin was stabilized during descent by the large mass of electrical wires trailing behind it. At T+76.437 the nose caps and drogue parachutes of the SRBs separated, as designed, and the drogue of the right-hand SRB was seen by a tracking camera, bearing the frustum and its location aids.Challenger Timeline ‚Äì Spaceflight Now, undated The Thiokol engineers who had opposed the decision to launch were watching the events on television. They had believed that any O-ring failure would have occurred at liftoff, and thus were happy to see the shuttle successfully leave the launch pad. At about one minute after liftoff, a friend of Boisjoly said to him \\"Oh God. We made it. We made it!\\" Boisjoly recalled that when the shuttle was destroyed a few seconds later, \\"we all knew exactly what happened\\". Veteran astronaut Robert Crippen was preparing to command STS-62-A, scheduled for mid-year, when his crew stopped training to watch the launch. Pete Aldridge recalled, \\"I was waiting for the orbiter, as we all were, to come out of the smoke. But as soon as that explosion occurred, Crippen obviously knew what it was. His head dropped. I remember this so distinctly\\". =Post-breakup flight controller dialogue= Jay Greene at his console after the breakup of Challenger In Mission Control, there was a burst of static on the air-to-ground loop as Challenger disintegrated. Television screens showed a cloud of smoke and water vapor (the product of hydrogen+oxygen combustion) where Challenger had been, with pieces of debris falling toward the ocean. At about T+89, flight director Jay Greene prompted his Flight Dynamics Officer (FIDO) for information. FIDO responded that \\"the filter has discreting sources\\", a further indication that Challenger had broken into multiple pieces. Moments later, the Ground Control Officer reported \\"negative contact (and) loss of downlink\\" of radio and telemetry data from Challenger. Greene ordered his team to \\"watch your data carefully\\" and look for any sign that the Orbiter had escaped. Mission Control during the liftoff of Challenger (STS-51-L) At T+110.250, the range safety officer (RSO) at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station sent radio signals that activated the range safety system's \\"destruct\\" packages on board both solid rocket boosters. This was a normal contingency procedure, undertaken because the RSO judged the free-flying SRBs a possible threat to land or sea. The same destruct signal would have destroyed the external tank had it not already disintegrated. The SRBs were close to the end of their scheduled burn (110 seconds after launch) and had nearly exhausted their propellants when the destruct command was sent, so very little, if any, explosive force was generated by this event. Public affairs officer Steve Nesbitt reported: \\"Flight controllers here are looking very carefully at the situation. Obviously a major malfunction. We have no downlink.\\" On the Mission Control loop, Greene ordered that contingency procedures be put into effect; these procedures included locking the doors of the control center, shutting down telephone communications with the outside world, and following checklists that ensured that the relevant data were correctly recorded and preserved. Nesbitt relayed this information to the public: \\"We have a report from the Flight Dynamics Officer that the vehicle has exploded. The flight director confirms that. We are looking at checking with the recovery forces to see what can be done at this point.\\" =Cause and time of death= The crew cabin, made of reinforced aluminum, was a particularly robust section of the orbiter. During vehicle breakup, it detached in one piece and slowly tumbled into a ballistic arc. NASA estimated the load factor at separation to be between 12 and 20 g; within two seconds it had already dropped to below 4g and within 10 seconds the cabin was in free fall. The forces involved at this stage were probably insufficient to cause major injury. At least some of the crew were alive and at least briefly conscious after the breakup, as three of the four recovered Personal Egress Air Packs (PEAPs) on the flight deck were found to have been activated.Joseph P. Kerwin's letter to Admiral Truly nasa.gov These were those of Judith Resnik, mission specialist Ellison Onizuka, and pilot Michael J. Smith.Riding Rockets, Mike Mullane, (New York 2006), Chapter 33 The location of Smith's activation switch, on the back side of his seat, likely indicated that either Resnik or Onizuka activated it for him. Astronaut Mike Mullane wrote that \\"There had been nothing in our training concerning the activation of a PEAP in the event of an in-flight emergency. The fact that Judy or El had done so for Mike Smith made them heroic in my mind.\\" Investigators found their remaining unused air supply consistent with the expected consumption during the 2-minute-and-45-second post-breakup trajectory. While analyzing the wreckage, investigators discovered that several electrical system switches on pilot Mike Smith's right-hand panel had been moved from their usual launch positions. Mike Mullane wrote, \\"These switches were protected with lever locks that required them to be pulled outward against a spring force before they could be moved to a new position.\\" Later tests established that neither the force of the explosion nor the impact with the ocean could have moved them, indicating that Smith made the switch changes, presumably in a futile attempt to restore electrical power to the cockpit after the crew cabin detached from the rest of the orbiter. Whether the crew members remained conscious long after the breakup is unknown, and largely depends on whether the detached crew cabin maintained pressure integrity. If it did not, the time of useful consciousness at that altitude is just a few seconds; the PEAPs supplied only unpressurized air, and hence would not have helped the crew to retain consciousness. If, on the other hand, the cabin was not depressurized or only slowly depressurizing, they may have been conscious for the entire fall until impact. Recovery of the cabin found that the middeck floor had not suffered buckling or tearing, as would result from a rapid decompression, thus providing some evidence that the depressurization may not have happened suddenly. NASA routinely trained shuttle crews for splashdown events, but the cabin hit the ocean surface at roughly , with an estimated deceleration at impact of well over 200 g, far beyond the structural limits of the crew compartment or crew survivability levels, and far greater than almost any automobile, aircraft, or train accident. The crew would have been torn from their seats and killed instantly by the extreme impact force. On July 28, 1986, NASA's Associate Administrator for Space Flight, former astronaut Richard H. Truly, released a report on the deaths of the crew from the director of Space and Life Sciences at the Johnson Space Center, Joseph P. Kerwin. A medical doctor and former astronaut, Kerwin was a veteran of the 1973 Skylab 2 mission. According to the Kerwin Report: Some experts believe most if not all of the crew were alive and possibly conscious during the entire descent until impact with the ocean. Astronaut and NASA lead accident investigator Robert Overmyer said, \\"I not only flew with Dick Scobee, we owned a plane together, and I know Scob did everything he could to save his crew. Scob fought for any and every edge to survive. He flew that ship without wings all the way down... they were alive.\\" =Prospect of crew escape= During powered flight of the space shuttle, crew escape was not possible. Launch escape systems were considered several times during shuttle development, but NASA's conclusion was that the shuttle's expected high reliability would preclude the need for one. Modified SR-71 Blackbird ejection seats and full pressure suits were used for the two-man crews on the first four shuttle orbital missions, which were considered test flights, but they were removed for the \\"operational\\" missions that followed. The Columbia Accident Investigation Board later declared, after the 2003 Columbia re-entry disaster, that the space shuttle system should never have been declared operational because it is experimental by nature due to the limited number of flights as compared to certified commercial aircraft. The multideck design of the crew cabin precluded use of such ejection seats for larger crews. Providing some sort of launch escape system had been considered, but deemed impractical due to \\"limited utility, technical complexity and excessive cost in dollars, weight or schedule delays\\". After the loss of Challenger, the question was reopened, and NASA considered several different options, including ejector seats, tractor rockets, and emergency egress through the bottom of the orbiter. NASA once again concluded that all of the launch escape systems considered would be impractical due to the sweeping vehicle modifications that would have been necessary and the resultant limitations on crew size. A system was designed to give the crew the option to leave the shuttle during gliding flight, but this system would not have been usable in the Challenger situation. Aftermath =White House response= U.S. President Ronald Reagan addresses the nation after the shuttle disaster. President Ronald Reagan had been scheduled to give the 1986 State of the Union Address on the evening of the Challenger disaster. After a discussion with his aides, Reagan postponed the State of the Union, and instead addressed the nation about the disaster from the Oval Office of the White House. Reagan's national address was written by Peggy Noonan, and was listed as one of the most significant speeches of the 20th century in a survey of 137 communication scholars. It finished with the following statement, which quoted from the poem \\"High Flight\\" by John Gillespie Magee Jr.: Memorial service on January 31, 1986, at Houston, Texas, attended by President Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan (left) Three days later, Ronald and Nancy Reagan traveled to the Johnson Space Center to speak at a memorial service honoring the crew members, where he stated: It was attended by 6,000 NASA employees and 4,000 guests, as well as by the families of the crew. During the ceremony, an Air Force band led the singing of \\"God Bless America\\" as NASA T-38 Talon jets flew directly over the scene, in the traditional missing-man formation. All activities were broadcast live by the national television networks. Rumors surfaced in the weeks after the disaster that the White House itself had pressed for Challenger to launch before the scheduled January 28 State of the Union address, because Reagan had intended to mention the launch in his remarks. Three weeks before the State of the Union address was to have been given, NASA did suggest that Reagan make callouts to the assumed successful Challenger launch, and to mention Christa McAuliffe's shuttle voyage as \\"'the ultimate field trip' of an American schoolteacher\\". In March 1986, The White House released a copy of the original State of the Union speech as it would have been given before the disaster. In that speech, Reagan intended to mention an X-ray experiment launched on Challenger and designed by a guest he'd invited to the address, but he did not plan any other specific discussion about the launch or NASA in the address. Inclusion of extensive discussion of NASA, the launch, or McAuliffe in the State of the Union address effectively stopped at the desk of Cabinet Secretary Alfred H. Kingon. In the rescheduled State of the Union address on February 4, President Reagan did mention the deceased Challenger crew members, and modified his remarks about the X-ray experiment as \\"launched and lost\\". =Recovery of debris and crew= In the first minutes after the accident, recovery efforts were begun by NASA's Launch Recovery Director, who ordered the ships normally used by NASA for recovery of the solid rocket boosters to be sent to the location of the water impact. Search and rescue aircraft were also dispatched. At this stage, since debris was still falling, the Range Safety Officer (RSO) held both aircraft and ships out of the impact area until it was considered safe for them to enter. It was about an hour until the RSO allowed the recovery forces to begin their work. The search and rescue operations that took place in the first week after the Challenger accident were managed by the Department of Defense on behalf of NASA, with assistance from the United States Coast Guard, and mostly involved surface searches. According to the Coast Guard, \\"the operation was the largest surface search in which they had participated.\\" This phase of operations lasted until February 7. In order to discourage scavengers, NASA did not disclose the exact location of the debris field and insisted on secrecy, utilizing code names such as \\"Target 67\\" to refer to the crew cabin and \\"Tom O'Malley\\" to refer to any crew remains. Radio Shack stores in the Cape Canaveral area were soon completely sold out of radios that could tune into the frequency used by Coast Guard vessels. Thereafter, recovery efforts were managed by a Search, Recovery, and Reconstruction team; its aim was to salvage debris that would help in determining the cause of the accident. Sonar, divers, remotely operated submersibles and crewed submersibles were all used during the search, which covered an area of , and took place at water depths between and . On March 7, divers from the USS Preserver identified what might be the crew compartment on the ocean floor. The finding, along with discovery of the remains of all seven crew members, was confirmed the next day and on March 9, NASA announced the finding to the press. The crew cabin was severely crushed and fragmented from the extreme impact forces; one member of the search team described it as \\"largely a pile of rubble with wires protruding from it\\". The largest intact section was the rear wall containing the two payload bay windows and the airlock. All windows in the cabin had been destroyed, with only small bits of glass still attached to the frames. Impact forces appeared to be greatest on the left side, indicating that it had struck the water in a nose-down, left-end-first position. Recovered right solid rocket booster showing the hole caused by the plume Inside the twisted debris of the crew cabin were the bodies of the astronauts which, after weeks of immersion in salt water and exposure to scavenging marine life, were in a \\"semi-liquefied state that bore little resemblance to anything living\\". However, according to John Devlin, the skipper of the USS Preserver, they \\"were not as badly mangled as you'd see in some aircraft accidents\\". Lt. Cmdr James Simpson of the Coast Guard reported finding a helmet with ears and a scalp in it. Judith Resnik was the first to be removed, followed by Christa McAuliffe, with more remains retrieved over several hours. Due to the hazardous nature of the recovery operation (the cabin was filled with large pieces of protruding jagged metal), the Navy divers protested that they would not go on with the work unless the cabin was hauled onto the ship's deck. During the recovery of the remains of the crew, Gregory Jarvis's body floated out of the shattered crew compartment and was lost to the diving team. A day later, it was seen floating on the ocean's surface. It sank as a team prepared to pull it from the water. Determined not to end the recovery operations without retrieving Jarvis, Crippen rented a fishing boat at his own expense and went searching for the body. On April 15, near the end of the salvage operations, the Navy divers found Jarvis. His body had settled to the sea floor, below the surface, some from the final resting place of the crew compartment. The body was recovered and brought to the surface before being processed with the other crew members and then prepared for release to Jarvis's family. Navy pathologists performed autopsies on the crew members, but due to the poor condition of the bodies, the exact cause of death could not be determined for any of them. The crew transfer took place on April 29, 1986, three months and one day after the accident. Seven hearses carried the crew's remains from the Life Sciences Facility on Cape Canaveral to a waiting MAC C-141 aircraft. Their caskets were each draped with an American flag and carried past an honor guard and followed by an astronaut escort. The astronaut escorts for the Challenger crew were Dan Brandenstein, James Buchli, Norm Thagard, Charles Bolden, Tammy Jernigan, Dick Richards, and Loren Shriver. Once the crew's remains were aboard the jet, they were flown to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to be processed and then released to their relatives. It had been suggested early in the investigation that the accident was caused by inadvertent detonation of the Range Safety destruct charges on the external tank, but the charges were recovered mostly intact and a quick overview of telemetry data immediately ruled out that theory. The three shuttle main engines were found largely intact and still attached to the thrust assembly despite extensive damage from impact with the ocean, marine life, and immersion in salt water. They had considerable heat damage due to a LOX-rich shutdown caused by the drop in hydrogen fuel pressure as the external tank began to fail. The memory units from Engines1 and2 were recovered, cleaned, and their contents analyzed, which confirmed normal engine operation until LH2 starvation began at T+72 seconds. Loss of fuel pressure and rising combustion chamber temperatures caused the computers to shut off the engines. Since there was no evidence of abnormal SSME behavior until 72 seconds (only about one second before the breakup of Challenger), the engines were ruled out as a contributing factor in the accident. Other recovered orbiter components showed no indication of pre-breakup malfunction. Recovered parts of the TDRSS satellite also did not disclose any abnormalities other than damage caused by vehicle breakup, impact, and immersion in salt water. The solid rocket motor boost stage for the payload had not ignited either and was quickly ruled out as a cause of the accident. The solid rocket booster debris had no signs of explosion (other than the Range Safety charges splitting the casings open), or propellant debonding and cracking. There was no question about the RSO manually destroying the SRBs following vehicle breakup, so the idea of the destruct charges accidentally detonating was ruled out. Premature separation of the SRBs from the stack or inadvertent activation of the recovery system was also considered, but telemetry data quickly disproved that idea. Nor was there any evidence of in-flight structural failure since visual and telemetry evidence showed that the SRBs remained structurally intact up to and beyond vehicle breakup. The aft field joint on the right SRB did show extensive burn damage. Telemetry proved that the right SRB, after the failure of the lower struts, had come loose and struck the external tank. The exact point where the struts broke could not be determined from film of the launch, nor were the struts or the adjacent section of the external tank recovered during salvage operations. Based on the location of the rupture in the right SRB, the P12 strut most likely failed first. The SRB's nose cone also exhibited some impact damage from this behavior (for comparison, the left SRB nose cone had no damage at all) and the intertank region had signs of impact damage as well. In addition, the orbiter's right wing had impact and burn damage from the right SRB colliding with it following vehicle breakup. Most of the initially considered failure modes were soon ruled out and by May 1, enough of the right solid rocket booster had been recovered to determine the original cause of the accident, and the major salvage operations were concluded. While some shallow- water recovery efforts continued, this was unconnected with the accident investigation; it aimed to recover debris for use in NASA's studies of the properties of materials used in spacecraft and launch vehicles. The recovery operation was able to pull of debris from the ocean; this means that 55% of Challenger, 5% of the crew cabin and 65% of the satellite cargo are still missing. Some of the missing debris continued to wash up on Florida shores for some years, such as on December 17, 1996, nearly 11 years after the incident, when two large pieces of the shuttle were found at Cocoa Beach. Under it is against the law to be in possession of Challenger debris, and any newly discovered pieces must be turned over to NASA. On board Challenger was an American flag, dubbed the Challenger flag, that was sponsored by Boy Scout Troop 514 of Monument, Colorado. It was recovered intact, still sealed in its plastic container. A soccer ball from the personal effects locker of Mission Specialist Ellison Onizuka was also recovered intact from the wreckage, and was later flown to the International Space Station aboard Soyuz Expedition 49 by American astronaut Robert S. Kimbrough. It is currently on display at Clear Lake High School in Houston, which was attended by Onizuka's children. All recovered non-organic debris from Challenger was ultimately buried in a former missile silo at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 31. =Funeral ceremonies= C-141 at the NASA KSC Shuttle Landing Facility, bound for Dover Air Force Base, Delaware. The remains of the crew that were identifiable were returned to their families on April 29, 1986. Three of the crew members, Judith Resnik, Dick Scobee, and Capt. Michael J. Smith, were buried by their families at Arlington National Cemetery at individual grave sites. Mission Specialist Lt Col Ellison Onizuka was buried at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu, Hawaii. Ronald McNair was buried in Rest Lawn Memorial Park in Lake City, South Carolina. Christa McAuliffe was buried at Calvary Cemetery in her hometown of Concord, New Hampshire. Gregory Jarvis was cremated, and his ashes scattered in the Pacific Ocean. Unidentified crew remains were buried communally at the Space Shuttle Challenger Memorial in Arlington on May 20, 1986. =Concurrent NASA crises= As a result of the disaster, several National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) satellites that only the shuttle could launch were grounded because of the accident. This was a dilemma the NRO had feared since the 1970s when the shuttle was designated as the United States' primary launch system for all government and commercial payloads.Day, Dwayne A. \\"The spooks and the turkey\\" The Space Review, 20 November 2006.Day, Dwayne A. \\"Big Black and the new bird: the NRO and the early Space Shuttle\\" The Space Review, 11 January 2010. Compounding NASA's problems were difficulties with its Titan and Delta rocket programs which suffered other unexpected rocket failures around the time of the Challenger disaster. On August 28, 1985, a Titan 34D carrying a KH-11 Kennen satellite exploded after liftoff over Vandenberg Air Force Base, when the first stage propellant feed system failed. It was the first failure of a Titan missile since 1978. On April 18, 1986, another Titan 34D-9 carrying a classified payload, said to be a Big Bird spy satellite, exploded at about above the pad after liftoff over Vandenberg AFB, when a burnthrough occurred on one of the rocket boosters. On May 3, 1986, a Delta 3914 carrying the GOES-G weather satellite exploded 71 seconds after liftoff over Cape Canaveral Air Force Station due to an electrical malfunction on the Delta's first stage, which prompted the range safety officer on the ground to decide to destroy the rocket, just as a few of the rocket's boosters were jettisoned. As a result of these three failures, NASA decided to cancel all Titan and Delta launches from Cape Canaveral and Vandenberg for four months until the problems in the rockets' designs were solved. A separate related accident occurred at the Pacific Engineering and Production Company of Nevada (PEPCON) plant in Henderson, Nevada. Due to the shuttle fleet being grounded, excess ammonium perchlorate that was manufactured as rocket fuel was being kept on site. This excess ammonium perchlorate later caught fire and the magnitude of the resulting explosion destroyed the PEPCON facility and the neighboring Kidd & Co marshmallow factory.American Pacific Corporation, Las Vegas, NV, parent company of the former PEPCON subsidiary and current parent to the WECCO division which manufactures perchlorate chemicals, including Human Resources, employees on site 5-4-88. Investigation In the aftermath of the accident, NASA was criticized for its lack of openness with the press. The New York Times noted on the day after the accident that \\"neither Jay Greene, flight director for the ascent, nor any other person in the control room, was made available to the press by the space agency.\\" In the absence of reliable sources, the press turned to speculation; both The New York Times and United Press International ran stories suggesting that a fault with the space shuttle external tank had caused the accident, despite the fact that NASA's internal investigation had quickly focused in on the solid rocket boosters. Archived by the Internet Archive on May 4, 2006.See, for example, New Orleans Times- Picayune, January 29, 1986, p. 1. \\"The space agency,\\" wrote space reporter William Harwood, \\"stuck to its policy of strict secrecy about the details of the investigation, an uncharacteristic stance for an agency that long prided itself on openness.\\" =Rogers Commission= SRB; outside to left.

The commission members were Chairman William P. Rogers, Vice Chairman Neil Armstrong, David Acheson, Eugene Covert, Richard Feynman, Robert Hotz, Donald Kutyna, Sally Ride, Robert Rummel, Joseph Sutter, Arthur Walker, Albert Wheelon, and Chuck Yeager. The commission worked for several months and published a report of its findings. It found that the Challenger accident was caused by a failure in the O-rings sealing a joint on the right solid rocket booster, which allowed pressurized hot gases and eventually flame to \\"blow by\\" the O-ring and make contact with the adjacent external tank, causing structural failure. The failure of the O-rings was attributed to a faulty design, whose performance could be too easily compromised by factors including the low ambient temperature on the day of launch. The O-rings would not work properly at ambient temperatures below ‚Äîand it was on the morning of the launch.https://er.jsc.nasa.gov/seh/explode.html According to the report in July 1985, a memorandum was sent to Michael Weeks, the agency's No. 2 shuttle official, and Jesse W. Moore, the associate administrator in charge of the shuttle program, raising attention to the \\"failure history\\" of the O rings and recommending a review of the matter. Members of the Rogers Commission arrive at Kennedy Space Center. More broadly, the report also considered the contributing causes of the accident. Most salient was the failure of both NASA and Morton-Thiokol to respond adequately to the danger posed by the deficient joint design. Rather than redesigning the joint, they came to define the problem as an acceptable flight risk. The report found that managers at Marshall had known about the flawed design since 1977, but never discussed the problem outside their reporting channels with Thiokol‚Äîa flagrant violation of NASA regulations. Even when it became more apparent how serious the flaw was, no one at Marshall considered grounding the shuttles until a fix could be implemented. On the contrary, Marshall managers went as far as to issue and waive six launch constraints related to the O-rings. The report also strongly criticized the decision-making process that led to the launch of Challenger, saying that it was seriously flawed: Richard Feynman One of the commission's members was theoretical physicist Richard Feynman. Feynman, who was then seriously ill with cancer, was reluctant to undertake the job. He did so at the encouragement of his wife, Gweneth Howarth. She convinced him to go, saying he might discover something others overlooked. He also wanted to find the root cause of the disaster and to speak plainly to the public about his findings.Freeman Dyson, 2011, \\"The Dramatic Picture of Richard Feynman\\" New York Review of Books, July 14, 2011. Reprinted in Before going to Washington, D.C., Feynman did his own investigation. He became suspicious about the O-rings. ‚ÄúO-rings show scorching in Clovis check,‚Äù he scribbled in his notes. \\"Once a small hole burns through generates a large hole very fast! Few seconds catastrophic failure.\\" At the start of investigation, fellow members Dr. Sally Ride and General Donald J. Kutyna told Feynman that the O-rings had not been tested at temperatures below . During a televised hearing, Feynman demonstrated how the O-rings became less resilient and subject to seal failures at ice-cold temperatures by immersing a sample of the material in a glass of ice water. While other members of the Commission met with NASA and supplier top management, Feynman sought out the engineers and technicians for the answers. He was critical of flaws in NASA's \\"safety culture\\", so much so that he threatened to remove his name from the report unless it included his personal observations on the reliability of the shuttle, which appeared as Appendix F. In the appendix, he argued that the estimates of reliability offered by NASA management were wildly unrealistic, differing as much as a thousandfold from the estimates of working engineers. \\"For a successful technology,\\" he concluded, \\"reality must take precedence over public relations, for nature cannot be fooled.\\"Feynman, Richard P. (1986) Appendix F ‚Äì Personal Observations on the reliability of the Shuttle. =U.S. House Committee hearings= The U.S. House Committee on Science and Technology also conducted hearings and, on October 29, 1986, released its own report on the Challenger accident. The committee reviewed the findings of the Rogers Commission as part of its investigation and agreed with the Rogers Commission as to the technical causes of the accident. It differed from the committee in its assessment of the accident's contributing causes: NASA and Air Force response Astronaut Charles F. Bolden reads a passage from the Bible during memorial services for the seven Challenger crew members. After the Challenger accident, further shuttle flights were suspended, pending the results of the Rogers Commission investigation. Whereas NASA had held an internal inquiry into the Apollo 1 fire in 1967, its actions after Challenger were more constrained by the judgment of outside bodies. The Rogers Commission offered nine recommendations on improving safety in the space shuttle program, and NASA was directed by President Reagan to report back within thirty days as to how it planned to implement those recommendations. When the disaster happened, the Air Force had performed extensive modifications of its Space Launch Complex 6 (SLC-6, pronounced as \\"Slick Six\\") at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, for launch and landing operations of classified Shuttle launches of satellites in polar orbit, and was planning its first polar flight for October 15, 1986. Originally built for the Manned Orbital Laboratory project cancelled in 1969, the modifications were proving problematic and expensive, costing over $4 billion (equivalent to $billion today). The Challenger loss motivated the Air Force to set in motion a chain of events that finally led to the May 13, 1988, decision to cancel its Vandenberg Shuttle launch plans in favor of the Titan IV uncrewed launch vehicle. In response to the commission's recommendation, NASA initiated a total redesign of the space shuttle's solid rocket boosters, which was watched over by an independent oversight group as stipulated by the commission. NASA's contract with Morton-Thiokol, the contractor responsible for the solid rocket boosters, included a clause stating that in the event of a failure leading to \\"loss of life or mission\\", Thiokol would forfeit $10 million (equivalent to $million today) of its incentive fee and formally accept legal liability for the failure. After the Challenger accident, Thiokol agreed to \\"voluntarily accept\\" the monetary penalty in exchange for not being forced to accept liability. NASA also created a new Office of Safety, Reliability and Quality Assurance, headed as the commission had specified by a NASA associate administrator who reported directly to the NASA administrator. George Martin, formerly of Martin Marietta, was appointed to this position. Former Challenger flight director Jay Greene became chief of the Safety Division of the directorate. The unrealistically optimistic launch schedule pursued by NASA had been criticized by the Rogers Commission as a possible contributing cause to the accident. After the accident, NASA attempted to aim at a more realistic shuttle flight rate: it added another orbiter, Endeavour, to the space shuttle fleet to replace Challenger, and it worked with the Department of Defense to put more satellites in orbit using expendable launch vehicles rather than the shuttle. In August 1986, President Reagan also announced that the shuttle would no longer carry commercial satellite payloads. After a 32-month hiatus, the next shuttle mission, STS-26, was launched on September 29, 1988. Although changes were made by NASA after the Challenger accident, many commentators have argued that the changes in its management structure and organizational culture were neither deep nor long-lasting. After the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster in 2003, attention once again focused on the attitude of NASA management towards safety issues. The Columbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB) concluded that NASA had failed to learn many of the lessons of Challenger. In particular, the agency had not set up a truly independent office for safety oversight; the CAIB decided that in this area, \\"NASA's response to the Rogers Commission did not meet the Commission's intent\\". The CAIB believed that \\"the causes of the institutional failure responsible for Challenger have not been fixed\\", saying that the same \\"flawed decision making process\\" that had resulted in the Challenger accident was responsible for Columbia's destruction seventeen years later. =Media coverage= While the presence of New Hampshire's Christa McAuliffe, a member of the Teacher in Space program, on the Challenger crew had provoked some media interest, there was little live broadcast coverage of the launch. The only live national TV coverage available publicly was provided by CNN. Los Angeles station KNBC also carried the launch with anchor Kent Shocknek describing the tragedy as it happened. Live radio coverage of the launch and explosion was heard on ABC Radio anchored by Vic Ratner and Bob Walker. CBS Radio broadcast the launch live then returned to their regularly scheduled programming just a few seconds before the explosion, necessitating anchor Christopher Glenn to hastily scramble back on the air to report what had happened. NBC, CBS, and ABC all broke into regular programming shortly after the accident; NBC's John Palmer announced there had been \\"a major problem\\" with the launch. Both Palmer and CBS anchor Dan Rather reacted to cameras catching live video of something descending by parachute into the area where Challenger debris was falling with confusion and speculation that a crew member may have ejected from the shuttle and survived. The shuttle had no individual ejection seats or a crew escape capsule. Mission control identified the parachute as a paramedic parachuting into the area but this was also incorrect based on internal speculation at mission control. The chute was the parachute and nose cone from one of the solid rocket boosters which had been destroyed by the range safety officer after the explosion. Due to McAuliffe's presence on the mission, NASA arranged for many US public schools to view the launch live on NASA TV. As a result, many who were schoolchildren in the US in 1986 had the opportunity to view the launch live. After the accident, 17 percent of respondents in one study reported that they had seen the shuttle launch, while 85 percent said that they had learned of the accident within an hour. As the authors of the paper reported, \\"only two studies have revealed more rapid dissemination [of news].\\" One of those studies is of the spread of news in Dallas after President John F. Kennedy's assassination, while the other is the spread of news among students at Kent State regarding President Franklin D. Roosevelt's death. Another study noted that \\"even those who were not watching television at the time of the disaster were almost certain to see the graphic pictures of the accident replayed as the television networks reported the story almost continuously for the rest of the day.\\" Children were even more likely than adults to have seen the accident live, since many children‚Äî48 percent of nine- to thirteen-year-olds, according to a New York Times poll‚Äîwatched the launch at school. Following the day of the accident, press interest remained high. While only 535 reporters were accredited to cover the launch, three days later there were 1,467 reporters at Kennedy Space Center and another 1,040 at the Johnson Space Center. The event made headlines in newspapers worldwide. =Use as case study= The Challenger accident has frequently been used as a case study in the study of subjects such as engineering safety, the ethics of whistle-blowing, communications, group decision-making, and the dangers of groupthink. It is part of the required readings for engineers seeking a professional license in Canada and other countries. Roger Boisjoly, the engineer who had warned about the effect of cold weather on the O-rings, left his job at Morton-Thiokol and became a speaker on workplace ethics. He argues that the caucus called by Morton- Thiokol managers, which resulted in a recommendation to launch, \\"constituted the unethical decision-making forum resulting from intense customer intimidation.\\" For his honesty and integrity leading up to and directly following the shuttle disaster, Roger Boisjoly was awarded the Prize for Scientific Freedom and Responsibility from the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Many colleges and universities have also used the accident in classes on the ethics of engineering. Information designer Edward Tufte has claimed that the Challenger accident is an example of the problems that can occur from the lack of clarity in the presentation of information. He argues that if Morton-Thiokol engineers had more clearly presented the data that they had on the relationship between low temperatures and burn-through in the solid rocket booster joints, they might have succeeded in persuading NASA managers to cancel the launch. To demonstrate this, he took all of the data he claimed the engineers had presented during the briefing, and reformatted it onto a single graph of O-ring damage versus external launch temperature, showing the effects of cold on the degree of O-ring damage. Tufte then placed the proposed launch of Challenger on the graph according to its predicted temperature at launch. According to Tufte, the launch temperature of Challenger was so far below the coldest launch, with the worst damage seen to date, that even a casual observer could have determined that the risk of disaster was severe.Edward Tufte. (1997) Visual Explanations, , Chapter 2. Tufte has also argued that poor presentation of information may have also affected NASA decisions during the last flight of the space shuttle Columbia. Boisjoly, Wade Robison, a Rochester Institute of Technology professor, and their colleagues have vigorously repudiated Tufte's conclusions about the Morton-Thiokol engineers' role in the loss of Challenger. First, they argue that the engineers didn't have the information available as Tufte claimed: \\"But they did not know the temperatures even though they did try to obtain that information. Tufte has not gotten the facts right even though the information was available to him had he looked for it.\\" This reference is used by the Online Ethics Center for Engineering and Research of the National Academy of Engineering of the National Academies. They further argue that Tufte \\"misunderstands thoroughly the argument and evidence the engineers gave.\\" They also criticized Tufte's diagram as \\"fatally flawed by Tufte's own criteria. The vertical axis tracks the wrong effect, and the horizontal axis cites temperatures not available to the engineers and, in addition, mixes O-ring temperatures and ambient air temperature as though the two were the same.\\" The Challenger disaster also provided a chance to see how traumatic events affected children's psyches. The large number of children who saw the accident live or in replays the same day was well known that day, and influenced the speech President Reagan gave that evening. At least one psychological study has found that memories of the Challenger explosion were similar to memories of experiencing single, unrepeated traumas. The majority of children's memories of Challenger were often clear and consistent, and even things like personal placement such as who they were with or what they were doing when they heard the news were remembered well. In one U.S. study, children's memories were recorded and tested again. Children on the East Coast recalled the event more easily than children on the West Coast, due to the time difference. Children on the East Coast either saw the explosion on TV while in school, or heard people talking about it. On the other side of the country, most children were either on their way to school, or just beginning their morning classes. Researchers found that those children who saw the explosion on TV had a more emotional connection to the event, and thus had an easier time remembering it. After one year the children's memories were tested, and those on the East Coast recalled the event better than their West Coast counterparts. Regardless of where they were when it happened, the Challenger explosion was still an important event that many children easily remembered. =Continuation of the Shuttle program= After the accident, NASA's Space Shuttle fleet was grounded for almost three years while the investigation, hearings, engineering redesign of the SRBs, and other behind- the-scenes technical and management reviews, changes, and preparations were taking place. At 11:37 on September 29, 1988, Space Shuttle Discovery lifted off with a crew of five, all veteran astronauts, from Kennedy Space Center pad 39-B. Its crew included Richard O. Covey, who had given the last status callout to Challenger before its breakup, \\"Challenger, go at throttle up\\". The shuttle carried a Tracking and Data Relay Satellite, TDRS-C (named TDRS-3 after deployment), which replaced TDRS-B, the satellite that was launched and lost on Challenger. The \\"Return to Flight\\" launch of Discovery also represented a test of the redesigned boosters, a shift to a more conservative stance on safety (being the first time the crew had launched in pressure suits since STS-4, the last of the four initial Shuttle test flights), and a chance to restore national pride in the American space program, especially crewed space flight. The mission, STS-26, was a success (with only two minor system failures, one of a cabin cooling system and one of a Ku-band antenna), and a regular schedule of STS flights followed, continuing without extended interruption until the 2003 Columbia disaster. Barbara Morgan, the backup for McAuliffe who trained with her in the Teacher in Space program and was at KSC watching her launch on January 28, 1986, flew on STS-118 as a Mission Specialist in August 2007. = Other civilian passenger plans = NASA had intended to send a wide range of civilian passengers into space on subsequent flights. These plans were all scrapped immediately following the Challenger disaster. NBC News's Cape Canaveral correspondent Jay Barbree was among 40 candidates in NASA's Journalist in Space Program. The first journalist was due to fly on the shuttle Challenger in September 1986. In 1984, prior to establishing the Teacher in Space Program (TISP), NASA created the Space Flight Participant Program whose aim was \\"to select teachers, journalists, artists, and other people who could bring their unique perspective to the human spaceflight experience as a passenger on the space shuttle.\\" Notable among early potential passengers was Caroll Spinney who, from 1969‚Äì2018, played the characters Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch on the children's television show Sesame Street. In 2014, after the situation was mentioned in the documentary I Am Big Bird, NASA confirmed the revelation, stating this: Spinney went on to say that the Big Bird costuming was prohibitive in the tight quarters of the NASA Space Shuttles and they had moved on. Legacy The Space Shuttle Challenger Memorial in Arlington National Cemetery, where some remains were buried The families of the Challenger crew organized the Challenger Center for Space Science Education as a permanent memorial to the crew. Forty-three learning centers and one headquarters office have been established by this non-profit organization. The astronauts' names are among those of several astronauts and cosmonauts who have died in the line of duty, listed on the Space Mirror Memorial at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex in Merritt Island, Florida. The final episode of the second season of Punky Brewster is notable for centering on the very recent, real-life Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. Punky and her classmates watched the live coverage of the shuttle launch in Mike Fulton's class. After the accident occurred, Punky is traumatized, and finds her dreams to become an astronaut are crushed. She writes a letter to NASA, and is visited by special guest star Buzz Aldrin. Seven asteroids were named after the crew members: , , , , , , and . The approved naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on March 26, 1986 (). On the evening of April 5, 1986, the Rendez-vous Houston concert commemorated and celebrated the crew of the Challenger. It features a live performance by musician Jean Michel Jarre, a friend of crew member Ron McNair. McNair was supposed to play the saxophone from space during the track \\"Last Rendez-Vous\\". It was to have become the first musical piece professionally recorded in space. His substitute for the concert was Houston native Kirk Whalum. In June 1986, singer-songwriter John Denver, a pilot with a deep interest in going to space himself, released the album One World including the song \\"Flying For Me\\" as a tribute to the Challenger crew. Hard rock band Keel dedicated their 1986 album The Final Frontier to the \\"Astronauts of the Space Shuttle Challenger the 28 of January 1986\\". On the cover of the album is a stylized \\"space shuttle\\" type vehicle with the band's logo, flying over the sea.https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/keel/the_final_frontier/ Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home was dedicated to the crew of the Challenger. Principal photography for The Voyage Home began four weeks after Challenger and her crew were lost. An unpainted decorative oval in the Brumidi Corridors of the United States Capitol was finished with a portrait depicting the crew by Charles Schmidt in 1987. An unpainted decorative oval in the Brumidi Corridors of the United States Capitol was finished with a portrait depicting the crew by Charles Schmidt in 1987. The scene was painted on canvas and then applied to the wall. In 1988, seven craters on the far side of the Moon, within the Apollo Basin, were named after the fallen astronauts by the IAU.   * In Huntsville, Alabama, home of Marshall Space Flight Center, Challenger Elementary School, Challenger Middle School, and the Ronald E. McNair Junior High School are all named in memory of the crew. Huntsville has also named new schools posthumously in memory of each of the Apollo 1 astronauts and the final Space Shuttle Columbia crew. Streets in a neighborhood established in the late-1980s in nearby Decatur are named in memory of each of the Challenger crew members (Onizuka excluded), as well as the three deceased Apollo1 astronauts. Julian Harris Elementary School is located on McAuliffe Drive, and its mascot is the Challengers. Squadron \\"Challenger\\" 17 logo. The Squadron \\"Challenger\\" 17 is an Air Force unit in the Texas A&M; Corps of Cadets that emphasizes athletic and academic success in honor of the Challenger crew. The unit was established in 1992. In San Antonio, Texas, Scobee Elementary School opened in 1987, the year after the disaster. Students at the school are referred to as \\"Challengers\\". An elementary school in Nogales, Arizona, commemorates the accident in name, Challenger Elementary School, and their school motto, \\"Reach for the sky\\". The suburbs of Seattle, Washington are home to Challenger Elementary School in Issaquah, Washington and Christa McAuliffe Elementary School in Sammamish, Washington. and Dick Scobee Elementary in Auburn, Washington. In San Diego, California, the next-opened public middle school in the San Diego Unified School District was named Challenger Middle School. The City of Palmdale, the birthplace of the entire shuttle fleet, and its neighbor City of Lancaster, California, both renamed 10th Street East, from AvenueM to Edwards Air Force Base, to Challenger Way in honor of the lost shuttle and its crew. This is the road that the Challenger, Enterprise, and Columbia all were towed along in their initial move from U.S. Air Force Plant 42 to Edwards AFB after completion since Palmdale airport had not yet installed the shuttle crane for placement of an orbiter on the 747 Shuttle Carrier Aircraft. In addition, the City of Lancaster has built Challenger Middle School, and Challenger Memorial Hall at the former site of the Antelope Valley Fairgrounds, all in tribute to the Challenger shuttle and crew. Another school was opened in Chicago, IL as the Sharon Christa McAuliffe Elementary school. The public Peers Park in Palo Alto, California features a Challenger Memorial Grove that includes redwood trees grown from seeds carried aboard Challenger in 1985. In Boise, ID, Boise High School has a memorial to the Challenger astrounauts. In 1986 in Webster, Texas, the Challenger Seven Memorial Park was also dedicated in remembrance of the event. Their Spirits Circle the Earth was installed in Columbus, Ohio, in 1987. In Port Saint John, Florida within Brevard County the same county that the Kennedy Space Center resides in is the Challenger7 Elementary School which is named in memory of the seven crew members of STS-51-L. There is a middle school in neighboring Rockledge, McNair Magnet School, named after astronaut Ronald McNair. A middle school (formerly high school) in Mohawk, New York is named after Payload Specialist Gregory Jarvis. There are schools named in honor of Christa McAuliffe in Boynton Beach, Florida; Denver, Colorado; Oceanside, California; Riverside, California; Saratoga, California; Stockton, California; Lowell, Massachusetts; Houston, Texas; Germantown, Maryland; Green Bay, Wisconsin; Hastings, Minnesota; Lenexa, Kansas; and Jackson, New Jersey. The McAuliffe- Shepard Discovery Center, a science museum and planetarium in Concord, New Hampshire, is partly named in her honor. The draw bridge over the barge canal on State Rd.3 on Merritt Island, Florida, is named the Christa McAuliffe Memorial Bridge. In Oxnard, CA, McAuliffe Elementary School is named after Christa McAuliffe, and bears tribute to the crew of the Challenger flight in its logo, with an image of the Shuttle and the motto \\"We Meet The Challenge.\\" The crew and mission are also tributed by the schools mascot, The Challengers, and their saying \\"We Reach for the Stars.\\" In 1990, a 1/10th 15 ft. size replica of Space Shuttle Challenger in lift off position, was created by residents and merchants of Little Tokyo district of Los Angeles, California. It stands on a 7ft base. To honor the astronauts and specifically Japanese American Astronaut Ellison S. Onizuka. https://www.roadsideamerica.com/tip/11736 The 1996 science fiction television series Space Cases is set on a spaceship known as the Christa, named in honor of Christa McAuliffe, described in the series as \\"an Earth teacher who died during the early days of space exploration\\". In 1997, playwright Jane Anderson wrote a play inspired by the Challenger incident, titled Defying Gravity. In 2001, Peruvian American rapper Immortal Technique released an album titled Revolutionary Vol. 1 which contained the song Dance With The Devil. A hidden track at the conclusion of the song contains the lyrics \\"I'm bout to blow up like, NASA Challenger computer chips\\". In 2004, President George W. Bush conferred posthumous Congressional Space Medals of Honor to all 14 crew members lost in the Challenger and Columbia accidents. In 2009, Allan J. McDonald, former director of the Space Shuttle Solid Motor Rocket Project for Morton-Thiokol, Inc. published his book Truth, Lies, and O-Rings: Inside the Space Shuttle Challenger Disaster. Up to that point, no one directly involved in the decision to launch Challenger had published a memoir about the experience. On June 14, 2011, Christian singer Adam Young, through his electronica project, released a song about the Challenger incident on his third studio album All Things Bright and Beautiful. In December 2013, Beyonc√© Knowles released a song titled \\"XO\\", which begins with a sample of former NASA public affairs officer Steve Nesbitt, recorded moments after the disaster: \\"Flight controllers here looking very carefully at the situation. Obviously a major malfunction.\\" The song raised controversy, with former NASA astronauts and families labelling Knowles's sample as \\"insensitive\\". Hardeep Phull of the New York Post described the sample's presence as \\"tasteless\\", and Keith Cowing of NASA Watch suggested that the usage of the clip ranged from \\"negligence\\" to \\"repugnant\\". On December 30, 2013, Knowles issued a statement to ABC News, saying: \\"My heart goes out to the families of those lost in the Challenger disaster. The song \\"XO\\" was recorded with the sincerest intention to help heal those who have lost loved ones and to remind us that unexpected things happen, so love and appreciate every minute that you have with those who mean the most to you. The songwriters included the audio in tribute to the unselfish work of the Challenger crew with hope that they will never be forgotten.\\" On December 31, 2013, NASA criticized the use of the sample, stating that \\"The Challenger accident is an important part of our history; a tragic reminder that space exploration is risky and should never be trivialized. NASA works everyday to honor the legacy of our fallen astronauts as we carry out our mission to reach for new heights and explore the universe.\\" On June 16, 2015, post-metal band Vattnet Viskar released a full-length album titled Settler which was largely inspired by the Challenger accident and Christa McAuliffe in particular. The album was released in Europe on June 29. Guitarist Chris Alfieri stated in a June 17, 2015 interview with Decibel Magazine that, \\"Christa was from Concord, New Hampshire, the town that I live in. One of my first memories is the Challenger mission's demise, so it's a personal thing for me. But the album isn't about the explosion, it's about everything else. Pushing to become something else, something better. A transformation, and touching the divine.\\" Fragment of Challengers fuselage on display as part of the \\"Forever Remembered\\" installation at Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex in 2015 On July 23, 2015, Australian post-rock band We Lost The Sea released an album titled Departure Songs about human sacrifice for the greater good, or for the progress of the human race itself, including the song \\"Challenger\\" which is split into two parts: \\"Flight\\" and \\"Swan Song\\". The song samples audio from NASA, a William S. Burroughs lecture, reactions of people witnessing the disaster, and Ronald Reagan's national address. On June 27, 2015, the \\"Forever Remembered\\" exhibit at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex, Florida, opened and includes a display of a section of Challengers recovered fuselage to memorialize and honor the fallen astronauts. The exhibit was opened by NASA Administrator Charles Bolden along with family members of the crew. On August 7, 2015 English singer-songwriter Frank Turner released his sixth album Positive Songs for Negative People which includes the song \\"Silent Key\\". The mountain range Challenger Colles on Pluto was named in honor of the victims of the Challenger disaster. The Challenger Columbia Stadium in League City, Texas is named in honor of the victims of both the Challenger disaster as well as the Columbia disaster in 2003. A tree for each astronaut was planted in NASA's Astronaut Memorial Grove at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, not far from the Saturn V building, along with trees for each astronaut from the Apollo 1 and Columbia disasters. Tours of the space center pause briefly near the grove for a moment of silence, and the trees can be seen from nearby NASA Road 1. Media =Video documentation= Until 2010, the live broadcast of the launch and subsequent disaster by CNN was the only known on-location video footage from within range of the launch site. , eight other motion picture recordings of the event have become publicly available: * a professional black-and-white NASA video recording closely showing the breakup and the subsequent remote detonation of one of the booster rockets. * a video recording by Jack Moss from the front yard of his house in Winter Haven, Florida, from Cape Canaveral * a video recording by Ishbel and Hugh Searle on a plane leaving from Orlando International Airport, from Cape Canaveral, was posted by their daughter Victoria on January 30, 2011 along with an interview taken on the couple two days earlier. * a Super 8 film recorded by then-19-year-old Jeffrey Ault of Orange City, Florida, at the Kennedy Space Center, from the launch * a video recording by Lawrence Hebert of Electric Sky Films, filmed at the Kennedy Space Center 10 miles from the launch, released in March 2012 * a video recording by Steven Virostek uncovered in May 2012 * a video recording by Michael and Frances VanKulick of Melbourne, Florida was made public in 2014. =Film= An ABC television movie titled Challenger was broadcast on February 24, 1990. It stars Barry Bostwick as Scobee, Brian Kerwin as Smith, Joe Morton as McNair, Keone Young as Onizuka, Julie Fulton as Resnik, Richard Jenkins as Jarvis, and Karen Allen as McAuliffe. A BBC docudrama titled The Challenger was broadcast on March 18, 2013, based on the last of Richard Feynman's autobiographical works, What Do You Care What Other People Think?

Music of the Middle Ages Serb from Herzegovina sings to gusle Church music was performed throughout medieval Serbia by choirs or individual singers. The songs performed at the time were derived from the Octoechos (Osmoglasnik), a collection of religious songs dedicated to Jesus. Composers from this era include nun Jefimija, monks Kir Stefan the Serb, Isaiah the Serb, and Nikola the Serb, who together belong to the \\"Serbo-Byzantine school\\". Aside from church music, the medieval era in Serbia included traditional music, about which little is known, and court music. During the Nemanjiƒá dynasty era musicians played an important role at the royal court, and were known as sviralnici, glumci and praskavnici. The rulers known for the musical patronage included Emperor Stefan Du≈°an and Despot ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá. Medieval musical instruments included horns, trumpets, lutes, psalteries, drums and cymbals. Traditional folk instruments include the gajde, kaval, dajre, diple, tamburitza, gusle, tapan (davul), sargija, ƒáemane (kemenche), zurla (zurna), and frula among others. Sung Serbian epic poetry has been an integral part of Serbian and Balkan music for centuries. In the highlands of Serbia and Montenegro these long poems are typically accompanied on a one-string fiddle called the gusle, and concern themselves with themes from history and mythology. After the Ottoman conquest of Serbia, music was enriched with oriental influences. From Habsburg rule, Serbia was enriched by Western music. Classical music Stevan Stojanoviƒá Mokranjac Composer and musicologist Stevan Stojanoviƒá Mokranjac is considered one of the most important founders of modern Serbian music. Born in 1856, Mokranjac taught music, collected Serbian traditional songs and did the first scholarly research on Serbian music. He was also the director of the first Serbian music school and one of the founders of the Union of Singing Societies. His most famous works are the Song Wreaths, also known as Garlands. During the 19th and 20th centuries numerous bands, both military and civilian, contributed to the development of music culture in Belgrade and other Serbian cities and towns. Prior to Mokranjac's era, Serbia's representatives of the Romantic period were world- renowned violinist Dragomir Krancevic (1847‚Äì1929), pianist Sidonija Ilic, pianist and composer Jovanka Stojkoviƒá and opera singer Sofija Sedmakov who achieved success performing in opera houses of Germany in the 1890s. For example, the promenade concert tradition was first established by The Serbian Prince Band founded in 1831, and its first conductor was Joseph Shlezinger, who composed music for the band based on traditional Serbian songs. This was a period when the first choral societies, then mostly sung in German and Italian language, were being organized. Later, the first Serbian language works for choirs were written by Kornelije Stankoviƒá. The Serbian composers Petar Konjoviƒá, Stevan Hristiƒá and Miloje Milojeviƒá, all born in the 1880s, were the most eminent composers of their generation. They maintained the national expression and modernized the romanticism into the direction of impressionism. The best-known composers born around 1910 studied in Europe, mostly in Prague. Ljubica Mariƒá, Stanojlo Rajiciƒá, Milan Ristiƒá took influence from Schoenberg, Hindemith and Haba, rejecting the \\"conservative\\" work of prior Serbian composers, seeing it as outdated and the wish for national expression was outside their interest. Other famous classical Serbian composers include Isidor Bajiƒá, Stanislav Biniƒçki and Josif Marinkoviƒá. Several notable composers used motifs from Serbian folk music and composed works inspired by Serbian history or culture, such as: Johannes Brahms, Franz Liszt, Arthur Rubinstein, Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, Franz Schubert, Hans Huber and other. In 1788, just before the start of the Habsburg‚ÄìOttoman War, a classical period composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart composed the La Bataille K. 535 (also known as ‚ÄúDie Belagerung Belgrads‚Äù - ‚ÄúThe Siege of Belgrade‚Äù), which was most likely inspired by previous sieges of Belgrade, while some scholars state that the composition was used to support the war effort. Thanks to Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá's good contacts during his stay in Vienna, Johann Strauss II composed the Serben-Quadrille intended for Serbian balls. During the Serbian‚ÄìTurkish Wars, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky composed the Marche slave, which was based od several Serbian folk songs. Nikolai Rimsky- Korsakov used some Serbian folk tunes to compose the Fantasy on Serbian Themes (1867). Serbian folk music =Ethno music= Serbian gusle Excerpt of an accordion performance at the Pokrajinski festival of Sombor in 2010. Frula can be heard in this performance of a Serb folk song. The ethno genre encompasses both vocal and non-vocal (instrumental) music. Instruments include bagpipes, flutes, horns, trumpets, lutes, psalteries, drums and cymbals such as: Frula (woodwind), Diple (dvojanka, woodwind), Gajde (bagpipe), Zurna (woodwind), Duduk (woodwind), Tambura (lute), Tamburitza (lute), Gusle (lute), Kaval (≈°upeljka, lute), Davul (tapan, goƒç, drum), Bouzouki (≈°argija, lute), Tarambuke (drum). Balkanika, Balkanopolis, Dvig, Slobodan Trkulja, Belo Platno, Teodulija, Kulin Ban are known Serbian musical groups that use traditional Balkan musical instruments and perform traditional songs and songs based on traditional music elements. =Old folk= The Serbian folk music is both rural (izvorna muzika) and urban (starogradska muzika) and includes a two-beat dance called kolo, which is a circle dance with almost no movement above the waist, accompanied by instrumental music made most often with an accordion, but also with other instruments: frula (traditional kind of a recorder), tamburica, or accordion. The Kolos usually last for about 5‚Äì13 minutes. Modern accordionists include Mirko Kodiƒá and Ljubi≈°a Pavkoviƒá. Some kolos are similar to the Hungarian cs√°rd√°s in that they are slow at the onset and gradually increase their speed until reaching a climax towards the end. Famous performers of Serbian folk music are Predrag Gojkoviƒá Cune, Predrag ≈Ωivkoviƒá Tozovac, Miroslav Iliƒá, Lepa Lukiƒá, Vasilija Radojƒçiƒá, ≈†aban Bajramoviƒá, Stani≈°a Sto≈°iƒá, Toma Zdravkoviƒá and others. Yugoslav singer, actress and writer, Olivera Katarina, has performed music of various genres, varying from Serbian traditional to pop music, and in numerous languages. She held 72 consecutive concerts in Paris Olympia. =New folk= During the 70s Serbian folk music started to use elements from oriental music, distancing from the original sound, style that is titled novokomponovana muzika (\\"newly composed music\\"). Soon many neo-folk singers emerged: ≈†aban ≈†auliƒá, Ja≈°ar Ahmedovski, Kemal Malovƒçiƒá, Mitar Miriƒá, Nada Topƒçagiƒá, ≈†eki Turkoviƒá, Ipƒçe Ahmedovski, Ljuba Aliƒçiƒá, Zorica Brunclik, Marinko Rokviƒá and others. Serbian folk scene was not homogeneous nor uniform. On one hand, following Western models, Vesna Zmijanac was creating a star-image, being sex-symbol, fashionista and gay icon as well. On the other hand, singers like Vera Matoviƒá, for example, have created folk subgenre, sort of rural folk, singing about works in field, domestic animals and themes from Serbian village. Louis was combining Serbian folk music with jazz. Their albums were sponsored and songs were broadcast on the Radio Television of Serbia, which led to domination of this genre. =Balkan brass= Goran Bregoviƒá performing live with his orchestra Brass bands, known as trubaƒçi (, \\"the trumpeters\\") are extremely popular, especially in Central and Southern Serbia where Balkan Brass Band originated. The trumpet was initially used as a military instrument to wake and gather soldiers and announce battles during First Serbian Uprising in the 19. century, but later took on the role of entertainment during downtime, as soldiers used it to transpose popular folk songs. When the war ended and the soldiers returned to the rural life, the music entered civilian life and eventually became a music style, accompanying special occasions such as slavas, baptisms, harvests, births and funerals. In 1831 the first official military band was formed by Prince Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá. Roma people have also adopted the tradition and enhanced the music, and today most of the best performers are Roma. The best known Serbian Brass musicians are Fejat Sejdiƒá, and Boban Markoviƒá and are also the biggest names in the world of modern brass band bandleaders. Guƒça trumpet festival is one of the most popular and biggest music festivals in Serbia is a five-day annual festival with 300 000 visitors. Popular music =Popular folk music= Pop-folk, colloquially known as turbo-folk (a term coined by rock musician Rambo Amadeus), music emerged in the 80s and reached its peak as the 90s subculture during the Yugoslav wars, the breakup of Yugoslavia and the regime of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá. It contains Serbian folk music as the basis with added elements from rock, pop and electronic dance music. The songs are also under the influence of Greek, Turkish and Bulgarian folk music. Although very popular both in Serbia and its region, turbo-folk is often criticised and referred to as distasteful and grotesque. Some of the most popular Serbian performers belong to this genre, such as Lepa Brena, Dragana Mirkoviƒá, Ceca, Aca Lukas, Jelena Karleu≈°a, Indira Radiƒá, Sa≈°a Matiƒá, Seka Aleksiƒá, ƒêani and Milica Pavloviƒá. Most of the turbo- folk singers were signed to Grand Production at one point in their careers due to its former dominance over the music scene. =Pop music= Marija ≈†erifoviƒá, the winner of Eurosong in 2007. Pioneers of pop music in Serbia are considered to have performed before and during the Second World War. At the end of the 1950s schlager singers such as Lola Novakoviƒá and ƒêorƒëe Marjanoviƒá appeared on the music scene, achieving great success. Since then, Serbian pop has been under the influence of the western scene. Although quite popular, pop music, like other commercial genres, has always been overshadowed in popularity by folk music. Some of the most prominent pop acts in Serbian through out the years have included Zdravko ƒåoliƒá, Aska, Bebi Dol, Zana, Tap 011, ≈Ωeljko Joksimoviƒá, Vlado Georgiev, Aleksandra Radoviƒá, Aleksandar \\"Sa≈°a\\" Kovaƒçeviƒá, Emina Jahoviƒá, Jelena Toma≈°eviƒá, Nata≈°a Bekvalac and many others. Marija ≈†erifoviƒá is noted as the only Serbian Eurovision winner, as she won it in 2007 with the song Molitva. =Rock music= As a member of the Non-Aligned Movement, Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, of which Serbia was a part, was far more open to western influences compared to the other socialist states. The western-influenced pop and rock music was socially accepted, the Yugoslav rock scene was well developed and covered in the media, which included numerous magazines, radio and TV shows. Following the breakup of Yugoslavia due to civil war, its rock scene also ceased to exist, but saw moderate revival in the 2000s. The most notable Serbian rock acts are Bajaga i Instruktori, ƒêorƒëe Bala≈°eviƒá, Disciplina Kiƒçme, Ekatarina Velika, Elektriƒçni Orgazam, Galija, Idoli, Kerber, Korni Grupa, Laboratorija Zvuka, Partibrejkers, Pekin≈°ka Patka, Piloti, Pop Ma≈°ina, Rambo Amadeus, Riblja ƒåorba, Smak, ≈†arlo Akrobata, YU Grupa, Van Gogh, and others. =Jazz= Jazz in Serbia appears in the 1920s when Markus Blam formed first jazz orchestra Studentski Micky Jazz. Jazz music was played mostly in salons and clubs, but it is also known that jazz orchestras toured in spas over the Serbia. This style of music has been present on the radio as well as in specialized magazines. Radio Belgrade started to work in 1929, every night after 22:30h Radio Jazz Orchestra played popular songs. First jazz society in Serbia was set up in 1953, but to the development of jazz the most contributed hosting famous musicians, among whom was Louis Armstrong in 1959 and 1960. The first Serbian musicians to rise to international fame were Mladen Gute≈°a who worked for famous musicians such as Lee Konitz, Benny Goodman and others and Du≈°ko Gojkoviƒá. These two entered The 1956 Encyclopedia Yearbook of Jazz of Leonard Feather. Other prominent names of Serbian jazz include Bora Rokoviƒá who composed jazz suite The Human Piano, Mihailo ≈Ωivanoviƒá, Branislav Kovaƒçev, Branko Pejakoviƒá, Milan Luliƒá, Boris Jojiƒá, Jovan Mikoviƒá and others. Poƒçeci d≈æeza u Jugoslaviji Among the most popular singers of jazz and blues in Serbia was ≈†aban Bajramoviƒá known as King of Romani music, who was included in the Time magazines list of top 10 blues singers in the world.\\"Ni≈°vil\\": D≈æind≈æer Bejkeru uruƒçena nagrada \\"≈†aban Bajramoviƒá\\" Vladan Mijatovic (Jazz pianist) is the young ambassador of the Serbian Jazz music in North America. =Hip-hop= Serbian hip hop emerged in the early 80s among the b-boy crews. The first Serbian Hip Hop record release was the Degout EP by The Master Scratch Band, which was released by Jugoton in 1984. However, Serbian hip-hop scene wasn't developed until the late 90s when hip-hop groups started to break out from the underground. Best known rappers and hip-hop collectives include Gru, Bad Copy, Beogradski sindikat and Marƒçelo. Artists such as Elitni Odredi, Rasta and Coby reached mainstream success by switching to more commercial sound and appealing to the wider audience. Bassivity and later Bassivity Digital have been the biggest regional hip-hop recording labels. Festivals Exit is an award- winning summer music festival which is held at the Petrovaradin Fortress in the city of Novi Sad, officially proclaimed as the \\"Best Major European Festival\\" at the EU Festival Awards. Other festivals include Belgrade Beer Fest in Belgrade, Gitarijada in Zajeƒçar, Ni≈°ville in Ni≈° and Guƒça Trumpet Festival in Guƒça. In the town of Guƒça, near the city of ƒåaƒçak is an annually held brass band festival called Guƒça trumpet festival in the Dragaƒçevo region of western Serbia with 600,000 visitors per year. Other popular festivals include Rock festivals Belgrade Beer Fest and Gitarijada, and Jazz festival Ni≈°ville.

The main campus is in Chennai. It was originally established on 4 September 1978 and after taking many different forms over the years, as per a September 2020 bill passed in the Tamil Nadu Legislative assembly, the varsity is now reconstituted to be an affiliating university for engineering colleges across Tamil Nadu excluding the engineering colleges that are part of the premier Anna Technological and Research University. The University is now the affiliating authority for close to 550 engineering colleges in Tamil Nadu. History Statue of C N Annadurai in College of Engineering, Guindy campus The first version of Anna University formed in 1978 had a similar constitution as the current structure of Anna Technological and Research University before various governments repeatedly kept changing the varsity's structure and affiliation scope. In 2001, under the Anna University Amendment Act of 2001, the erstwhile Anna University became an affiliating university, taking under its wings all the engineering colleges in Tamil Nadu. This included six government engineering colleges, three government-aided private institutions, and 426 self-financing colleges. On 1 February 2007, as a result of a Government of Tamil Nadu decision, the university was split into six constituent universities: Anna University, Chennai, Anna University of Technology, Chennai, Anna University of Technology, Tiruchirappalli, Anna University of Technology, Coimbatore, Anna University of Technology Tirunelveli and Anna University of Technology, Madurai. The institutes were formally created in 2010. On 14 September 2011, a bill was passed to merge back the universities. The merger became final in August 2012. In 2011 and 2012 the constituents were merged back to a single affiliating university and the four regional universities continue to function as regional campus of the university. And then in September 2020, the Tamil Nadu government passed a bill making the varsity's four campuses in Chennai to be constituted as a 'unitary type' institution and called 'Anna Technological and Research University' while a new affiliating type university called 'Anna University' will be constituted to manage the affairs of the constituent and affiliated colleges. The subsequent new Acts will be called Anna University (Amendment) Act 2020 and Anna Technological and Research University Act 1978. The new Act will come into force after the state government issues a notification. Admissions A common entrance test ‚Äì the Tamil Nadu Professional Courses Entrance Examination (TNPCEE) ‚Äî was used as a basis for admission to professional courses in the state until 2006. Starting in the academic year 2007‚Äì08, students were admitted to engineering colleges on the basis of their higher secondary marks. Post graduate admission process is carried out through TANCET and GATE scores. Academics The university offers courses in engineering and technology through its affiliated colleges and follows a dual semester system. Every year the university conducts examinations for even semester in May‚ÄìJune and for odd semester in November‚ÄìDecember. The first semester students have exams in January. = Rankings = Affiliated colleges The university's campus is in Chennai. The university has satellite campuses in Coimbatore, Tiruchirappalli, Madurai and Tirunelveli.

They occupied the Birrarung (Yarra River) Valley before British colonisation of the area, around the present location of Melbourne. The \\"Wurundjeri\\" are the people who occupy one tribal territory, while \\"Woiwurrung\\" is the language group shared by the other tribal territory groups and clans within the Woiwurrung territory. The term Wurundjeri is often used to describe the Woiwurrung people as a whole, although it was only one of a number of Woiwurrung peoples. The Wurundjeri Tribe Land and Compensation Cultural Heritage Council was established in 1985 by some descendants of the Wurundjeri people. Ethnonym According to the early Australian ethnographer Alfred William Howitt, the name Wurundjeri, in his transcription Urunjeri, refers to a species of eucalypt, Eucalyptus viminalis, otherwise known as the manna or white gum, which is common along Birrarung. Some modern reports of Wurundjeri traditional lore state that their ethnonym combines a word, wurun, meaning Manna Gum and djeri, a species of grub found in the tree, and take the word therefore to mean \\"Witchetty Grub People\\". Language Wurundjeri people speak Woiwurrung, one of the five languages of the Kulin nations. Languages of the five Kulin nations. Country Norman Tindale estimated Wurundjeri lands as extending over approximately (.).These took in the areas of the Yarra and Saltwater rivers around Melbourne, and ran north as far as Mount Disappointment, northwest to Macedon, Woodend, and Lancefield. Their eastern borders went as far as Mount Baw Baw and Healesville. Their southern confines approached Mordialloc, Warragul, and Moe. History The earliest European settlers came across a park-like landscape extending inland from Melbourne, consisting of large areas of grassy plains to the north and southwest, with little forest cover, something thought to be testimony of indigenous sheet burning practices to expose the massive number of yam daisies (murnong) which proliferated in the area. These murnong roots and various tuber lilies formed a major source of starch and carbohydrates. Seasonal changes in the weather, availability of foods and other factors would determine where campsites were located, many near the Birrarung and its tributaries. The Wurundjeri & Gunung Willam Balug Tribes mined diorite at Mount William stone axe quarry which was a source of the highly valued greenstone hatchet heads, which were traded across a wide area as far as New South Wales and Adelaide. The mine provided a complex network of trading for economic and social exchange among the different Aboriginal nations in Victoria. The quarry had been in use for more than 1,500 years and covered 18 hectares including underground pits of several metres. In February 2008 the site was placed on the Australian National Heritage List for its cultural importance and archeological value. Settlement and dispossession of the Wurundjeri lands began soon after a ceremony in which Wurundjeri leaders conducted a tanderrum ceremony, whose function was to allow outsiders temporary access to the resources of clan lands. John Batman and other whites interpreted this symbolic act, recorded in treaty form, as equivalent to medieval enfeoffment of all Woiwurrong territory. Within a few years settlement began around Pound Bend with Major Charles Newman at Mullum Mullum Creek in 1838, and James Anderson on Beal Yallock, now known as Anderson's Creek a year later. Their measures to clear the area of aborigines was met with guerrilla skirmishing, led by Jaga Jaga, with the appropriation of cattle and the burning of fields. They were armed with rifles, and esteemed to be excellent marksmen, firing close to Anderson to drive him off as they helped themselves to his potato crop while en route to Yering in 1840. A trap set there by Captain Henry Gibson led to Jaga Jaga's capture and a battle as the Wurundjeri fought unsuccessfully to secure his release. Resistance was broken, and settlements throve. One elder, Derrimut, later stated: > You see‚Ä¶all this mine. All along here Derrimut's once. No matter now, me > soon tumble down‚Ä¶Why me have no lubra? Why me have no piccaninny? You have > all this place. No good have children, no good have lubra. Me tumble down > and die very soon now. =Coranderrk= In 1863 the surviving members of the Wurundjeri tribe were given \\"permissive occupancy\\" of Coranderrk Station, near Healesville and forcibly resettled. Despite numerous petitions, letters, and delegations to the Colonial and Federal Government, the grant of this land in compensation for the country lost was refused. Coranderrk was closed in 1924 and its occupants bar five refusing to leave Country were again moved to Lake Tyers in Gippsland. =Wurundjeri today= All remaining Wurundjeri people are descendants of Bebejan, through his daughter Annie Borate (Boorat), and in turn, her son Robert Wandin (Wandoon). Bebejan was a Ngurungaeta of the Wurundjeri people and was present at John Batman's \\"treaty\\" signing in 1835. Joy Murphy Wandin, a Wurundjeri Elder, explains the importance of preserving Wurundjeri culture: > In the recent past, Wurundjeri culture was undermined by people being > forbidden to \\"talk culture\\" and language. Another loss was the loss of > children taken from families. Now, some knowledge of the past must be found > and collected from documents. By finding and doing this, Wurundjeri will > bring their past to the present and recreate a place of belonging. A > \\"keeping place\\" should be to keep things for future generations of our > people, not a showcase for all, not a resource to earn dollars.

Hall) is a computer programmer and advocate of free software, best known for his work on FreeDOS. Hall began writing the free replacement for the MS-DOS operating system in 1994 when he was still a physics student at the University of Wisconsin-River Falls. He remains active with FreeDOS, and is currently the coordinator for the project. Hall has said he created FreeDOS in response to Microsoft announcing end of support for MS- DOS in 1994, a year before Windows 95 was released. As a user and fan of MS- DOS, Hall did not want the functionality of DOS to go away. Prompted by a March 31, 1994 post on comp.os.msdos.misc asking if \\"anyone, for example GNU et al. ever considered writing a Public Domain DOS\\", Hall decided to garner support for a free version of DOS, written under a free or public domain model. In a June 29, 1994 post, Hall announced an effort to create a free DOS, called PD-DOS, writing: Within a few weeks, other programmers including Pat Villani and Tim Norman joined the project. A kernel, the COMMAND.COM command line interpreter (shell) and core utilities were created by pooling code they had written or found available. Hall wrote over a dozen of the first DOS utilities for the project, mostly file and batch utilities. In a July 26, 1994 post, Hall announced the PD-DOS project had been renamed to \\"Free-DOS\\", having updated the project's goals to intend to distribute source code under the GNU General Public License. The project would later be renamed \\"FreeDOS\\", without the hyphen, after the publication of FreeDOS Kernel, by Pat Villani. Hall was the project's release coordinator from Beta1 until about Beta7, and also released the first alpha distribution of Free-DOS, as announced in a post on comp.os.msdos.misc. He is again the project coordinator since April 2011 after Pat Villani's departure. Hall is also the original developer of GNU Robots, but he is no longer active on this project and has since handed maintainership over to Tim Northover. It is now being developed by Bradley Smith.

It is the location of the former Tempelhof Airport, one of the earliest commercial airports in the world. It is now deserted and shows as a blank spot on maps of Berlin. Attempts are being made to save the still-existing buildings. The Tempelhof locality is located in the south-central part of the city. Before Berlin's 2001 administrative reform, the area of Tempelhof, together with the localities of Mariendorf, Marienfelde, and Lichtenrade, constituted a borough of its own, also called Tempelhof. These localities grew from historic villages on the Teltow plateau founded in the early 13th century in the course of the German Ostsiedlung. History Tempelhove was first mentioned in a 1247 deed issued at the Walkenried Abbey as a Komturhof (commander's court, the smallest holding entity of a military order) of the Knights Templar, whose leadership and many fellow knights had been expelled from the Kingdom of Jerusalem upon its downfall in 1291. The heart of the old settlement, consisting of the church and the original estate, was fortified and originally completely surrounded by water. The Templars were joined by fifteen families of landless farmers' sons from the Rhine, who could not inherit any estate from their parents because of over-fragmentation of those estates. Legates of the Templars offered them fertile soil and the protection of Tempelhove's stronghold. After Pope Clement V officially abolished the Order of the Temple in 1312, the knights of Saint John (the Johanniter), backed by Margrave Waldemar of Brandenburg, took over the villages of Tempelhof, Mariendorf, and Marienfelde. In 1435, they sold their estates to the city of Berlin. In the early nineteenth century, Tempelhof was still a village outside Berlin proper and was the site of country excursions for the citizens of Berlin.See Theodor Fontane's Schach von Wuthenow. The northern parts of Tempelhof were incorporated as Berlin's Tempelhofer Vorstadt in 1861 and in 1920 became part of the Kreuzberg borough. Today, the former commandry () is a chain of parks, called Bosepark, Kleiner Park, Alter Park, and Franckepark. Some of them still have ponds that were part of the artificial moat surrounding the village's center. One, the Krummer Pfuhl, located in the Franckepark, after being turned into public swimming baths in the nineteenth century, has completely dried out and is now an enclosed deer park. The original church, built from glacial boulders, was destroyed in the Second World War and was replaced with one built of ashlar or dressed stone with a timber-frame tower. The Tempelhof Studios were established in 1912 and functioned as film and later television studios.

In most commercially available blunts, the \\"leaves\\" are not actual tobacco leaves but rather paper made from tobacco pulp. Tobacco leaf with blunt end Blunts originally got their name from their \\"broad or rounded tip\\", and were named as such in the 19th century to differentiate them from other cigars with a tapered, pointed tip. Blunts are a specific size cigar that have been so popular as to have been once sold in specific vending machines. The original blunt cigar was manufactured in Philadelphia out of a single leaf outer tobacco wrapper. At the time this was the only cigar wrapped in one continuous leaf, other cigars used pieces of leaves for their outer wrapper. Tobacco leaves naturally taper at the ends. Since this cigar was rolled in one leaf the end would taper and had a round appearance (thus leading to the Blunt name). Due to the popularity of this style of cigar many other Blunts were launched into the marketplace. Brands of blunts include: Phillies, Dutch Masters, Backwoods, White Owl, Altadis marketing \\"Antonio Y Cleopatra\\", \\"El Producto\\", and \\"Tampa Nugget\\" brands, Swedish Match marketing \\"Game\\" and \\"Garcia Y Vega\\" brands, and Swisher Sweets marketing \\"King Edward\\", \\"Optimo\\", and Pom Pom brands. These types of cigars are commonly sold in convenience stores, gas stations, grocery stores, and drugstores, in contrast to premium cigars, which are sold in cigar shops. Blunts burn quickly like cigarettes, and some can be smoked in about five minutes, whereas a premium cigar takes an hour or so to burn. Unlike premium cigars, blunts are either already cut or have a hole in the mouth end for the smoke to go through, and so they do not need to be cut at the mouth end. Blunts are also significantly cheaper than premium cigars. Over time the term Blunt came to describe any cigar wrapped in a single continuous leaf. However, in the 1970s a new manner of producing cigars was invented. This manner is known as spiral binding.(WO/1996/014761) METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR WRAPPING A ROD OF SMOKING MATERIAL, WIPO No longer did cigars have to be rolled in a continuous single leaf but instead a continuous spiral wrap from base to tip could be employed. The basic shape of a blunt remained unchanged although the burn characteristics of a spiral wrapped cigar is not the same as a single continuous leaf. However spiral wrapping is much less expensive than using a full single tobacco leaf. Spiral wrapping gives a better seal than a single continuous leaf as overlapping can be done (much like wrapping an arm in a bandage, spiral wrapping is easier to seal than a single continuous bandage). Individually packaged blunt leaves have been available for many years. These are tobacco leaves that because of their nature and appearance are used to roll a cigar in one continuous sheet (thus the name blunt is used). The United States Tobacco Taxation Board has classified all individual cigar wrappers as \\"blunts\\" and taxes them as roll- your-own tobacco. Many US states classify blunt wraps as tobacco and a license is required to sell them and collect tax.Michigan Tax on Blunt WrapsMontana Tax and classification of Blunt Wraps Canada defines a blunt wrap as \\"a sheet or tube made of tobacco used to roll cigarette tobacco in‚Äîsimilar to rolling paper\\". Use of these single continuous sheets is closer to the original blunts of the 19th century since it is not a spiral wrap.

B. Cashwell and A. B. Crumpler, chapter 2. or 1860 ‚Äì 1916) was an early Pentecostal leader in the southern United States. He was born in Sampson County, North Carolina.His importance lies in bringing several Holiness movements into the Pentecostal camp. Biography G. B. Cashwell first became a minister in the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, and later joined the Holiness Church of North Carolina in 1903. In November 1906, he traveled to Los Angeles to visit the Pentecostal revival at the Azusa Street mission. In early December, he had an experience that he believed to be the baptism in the Holy Spirit and the evidence of speaking in tongues. Upon returning to Dunn, North Carolina, on December 31, 1906, Cashwell preached the Pentecostal experience in the local Holiness church.The Genesis of the Pentecostal Movement, Part 2 Interest in the Pentecostal experience was so great that he rented a local tobacco warehouse and began a month-long crusade. A revival broke out in North Carolina, especially in the holiness movement. Most of the ministers of the Pentecostal Holiness Church, the Fire-Baptized Holiness Church and the Holiness Free Will Baptist Churches were swept into Pentecostalism by this revival. Over the next six months, he toured the south preaching Pentecost. His zeal and influence in spreading Pentecostalism through the south has earned him the title of the \\"Apostle of Pentecost to the South\\". In the summer of 1907, Cashwell brought the message of Pentecost to evangelists H. G. Rodgers and M. M. Pinson, who carried the message to Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and Mississippi. Later they would lead these churches into the Assemblies of God. Through Rodgers and Pinson, A. J. Tomlinson of the Church of God in Cleveland, Tennessee, heard of Cashwell's message and invited him to Cleveland. On January 12, 1908, following a sermon by Cashwell, Tomlinson fell to the floor. He professed to receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost and speaking in at least ten different languages. In October 1907, Cashwell started a publication in Atlanta, Georgia, called The Bridegroom's Messenger. The periodical was created to spread the Pentecostal message over the country through a combination of sermons, articles, editorials, and testimonies. He edited it for seven months before turning it over to Elizabeth A. Sexton (who had been the Associate Editor since the second issue) and returned fully to his evangelistic efforts. The periodical was later taken over by Sexton's daughter and son-in-law, Hattie and Paul Barth, who organized the International Pentecostal Assemblies (now International Pentecostal Church of Christ). Although the influence of Cashwell was strong, his time of association with the Pentecostal movement was for a brief period of three years‚Äîfrom his conversion in 1906 until his departure from the Pentecostal Holiness Church in 1909. In 1910 and afterward, his name no longer appeared in the roster of ministers belonging to the Pentecostal Holiness Church. Cashwell distanced himself from Pentecostalism, and apparently rejoined the Methodist church. Cashwell's apostleship of Pentecostalism in the south influenced many denominations. About a dozen existing Pentecostal bodies can trace their Pentecostal heritage directly or at least in part to Gaston B. Cashwell, including: *Assemblies of God USA *Church of God (Cleveland) *Church of God of Prophecy *Congregational Holiness Church *International Pentecostal Church of Christ *International Pentecostal Holiness Church *Pentecostal Free Will Baptist Church References Further reading * Category:1860s births Category:1916 deaths Category:American Methodist clergy Category:American Pentecostal pastors Category:Pentecostal writers ","title":"Gaston B.

Decoys have been used for centuries most notably in game hunting, but also in wartime and in the committing or resolving of crimes. Illustration demonstrating the use of a dog in a duck decoy tunnel (1886) The term decoy may refer to two distinct devices, both used for hunting wildfowl. One is a long cone-shaped wickerwork tunnel installed on a small pond to catch wild ducks. After the ducks settled on the pond, a small, trained dog would herd the birds into the tunnel. The catch was formerly sent to market for food, but now these are used only by ornithologists to catch ducks to be ringed and released. The word decoy, also originally found in English as \\"coy\\", derives from the Dutch de Kooi (the cage) and dates back to the early 17th century, when this type of duck trap was introduced to England from the Netherlands. As \\"decoy\\" came more commonly to signify a person or a device than a pond with a cage-trap, the latter acquired the retronym \\"decoy pool\\". The other form of duck decoy, otherwise known as a hunting decoy or wildfowl decoy, is a life-size model of the creature. The hunter places a number about the hunting area as they will encourage wild birds to land nearby, hopefully within the range of the concealed hunter. Originally carved from wood, they are now typically made from plastic. Wildfowl decoys (primarily ducks, geese, shorebirds, and crows, but including some other species) are considered a form of folk art. Collecting decoys has become a significant hobby both for folk art collectors and hunters. The world record was set in September 2007 when a pintail drake and Canada goose, both by A. Elmer Crowell sold for 1.13 million dollars apiece. Military decoy An inflatable dummy tank, modeled after the World War 2, M4 Sherman The decoy in war is a low-cost device intended to represent a real item of military equipment. They may be deployed in amongst their real counterparts, to fool enemy forces into attacking them and so protect the real items of equipment by diverting fire away from them. Alternatively, large numbers of military decoys, or dummys, may be deployed as an aspect of military deception. Their purpose is to fool the enemy into believing forces in a particular area are much stronger than they really are. One notable example are Quaker Guns. For a defense system, decoys and chaff for ICBMs would mainly work in mid-course: during the boost phase they would be inside the rocket, because separate rockets for each of many decoys would not be practical, while at atmospheric reentry light decoys and chaff considerably slow down and/or are destroyed in the atmosphere. =Bomb decoy= In irregular warfare, improvised explosive devices are commonly used as roadside bombs to target military patrols. Some guerillas also use imitation IEDs to intimidate civilians, to waste bomb disposal resources,http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a528332.pdf or to set up an ambush. Some terrorist groups use fake bombs during a hostage siege, in order to limit hostage rescue efforts. = Sonar decoy = A sonar decoy is a device designed to create a misleading reading on sonar, such as the appearance of a false target. In biochemistry In biochemistry, there are decoy receptors, decoy substrates and decoy RNA. In addition, digital decoys are used in protein folding simulations. =Decoy receptor= Decoy receptors, or sink receptors, are receptors that bind a ligand, inhibiting it from binding to its normal receptor. For instance, the receptor VEGFR-1 can prevent vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) from binding to the VEGFR-2 The TNF inhibitor etanercept exerts its anti-inflammatory effect by being a decoy receptor that binds to TNF. =Decoy substrate= A decoy substrate or pseudosubstrate is a protein that has similar structure to the substrate of an enzyme, in order to make the enzyme bind to the pseudosubstrate rather than to the real substrate, thus blocking the activity of the enzyme. These proteins are therefore enzyme inhibitors. Examples include K3L produced by vaccinia virus, which prevents the immune system from phosphorylating the substrate eIF-2 by having a similar structure to eIF-2. Thus, the vaccinia virus avoids the immune system. =Digital decoys = In protein folding simulations, a decoy is a computer-generated protein structure which is designed so to compete with the real structure of the protein. Decoys are used to test the validity of a protein model; the model is considered correct only if it is able to identify the native state configuration of the protein among the decoys. Decoys are generally used to overcome a main problem in protein folding simulations: the size of the conformational space. For very detailed protein models, it can be practically impossible to explore all the possible configurations to find the native state. To deal with this problem, one can make use of decoys. The idea behind this is that it is unnecessary to search blindly through all possible conformations for the native conformation; the search can be limited to a relevant sub-set of structures. To start with, all non-compact configurations can be excluded. A typical decoy set will include globular conformations of various shapes, some having no secondary structures, some having helices and sheets in different proportions. The computer model being tested will be used to calculate the free energy of the protein in the decoy configurations. The minimum requirement for the model to be correct is that it identifies the native state as the minimum free energy state (see Anfinsen's dogma). Decoys as folk art Ever since Joel Barber, the first known decoy collector, started in 1918, decoys have become increasingly viewed as an important form of North American folk art. Barber's book Wild Fowl Decoys, was the first book on decoys as collectible objects. It was followed in 1965 by folk art dealer Adele Earnest's \\"The Art of the Decoy\\" and \\"American Bird Decoys\\" by collector Wm. J. Mackey. William J. Mackey made many trips to Chincoteague Island for the great flounder fishing as well as hunting for Chincoteague decoys. On his trips to the island he called Snug Harbor Marina home. He would send out locals to search for great finds of Chincoteague history. Cigar Daisey was one of the local Chincoteaguers that would help Mackey find all the best decoys that made his collection world- famous. Cigar has told many stories of the many truck loads of decoys he rounded up for his good friend. By that time a milestone in collecting had already occurred with the publication of \\"Decoy Collectors Guide\\", a small magazine created by hobbyists Hal & Barbara Sorenson of Burlington, Iowa. The 'Guide' helped foster a sense of community and provided a forum for collectors to share their research. By the 1970s decoys were becoming big business, at least by previous standards. The death of Wm. F. Mackey brought his decoys to market in a series of auctions in 1973 and 1974, with the star of his collection, a Long-billed Curlew by Wm. 'Bill' Bowman selling for a record US$10,500. Since the 1960s numerous collectors organizations have been created, specialist books and magazines published, with specialist dealers, and special interest shows around the US and Canada. The largest collectors organization is the Midwest Decoy Collectors Association which despite its name is an international group. It is a non-profit, [501(c)(3)] organization which sponsors the biggest show of the year. There are numerous state and regional groups as well. The current world record was set when two decoys (Canada goose and a preening pintail drake) by A. Elmer Crowell of East Harwich, MA were sold for $1.13 million each on September 19, 2007 by Stephen O'Brien Jr. Fine Arts, in what O'Brien describes as \\"the largest private sale of decoys ever.\\" The decoys were part of a private sale of 31 decoys for $7.5 million. Joe Engers, Editor of Decoy Magazine, noted that O'Brien is one of the top dealers of decoys in the country. Among other admired makers were the Ward brothers, Lemuel (1896‚Äì1984) and Steven, of Crisfield, Maryland. Their career output is estimated at between 27,000 and 40,000 birds, working and decorative. One of the most famous decoy makers in recent times is Delbert \\"Cigar\\" Daisey from Chincoteague Va. Cigar decoys are in high demand all over the country. The best decoy he ever made was a pintail that he made for his wife in 1973. This decoy was featured in National Geographic in June 1980 on page 826. This decoy is estimated to be worth between $100,000 - $150,000. Fish decoy collecting is also quite popular. Especially ice fishing decoys. See also fishing lures.

Early life He was the son of Joscelin II and his wife Beatrice of Saone. He inherited the title of Count of Edessa from his father, Joscelin II, although Edessa had been captured in 1144 and its remnants (including the Lordship of Turbessel) conquered or sold years before he took the title. Joscelin lived in the Kingdom of Jerusalem and managed to gather enough land around Acre to set up the Seigneurie of Joscelin. Royal Guardian His sister, Agnes of Courtenay, had been the first wife of King Amalric I before he succeeded to the throne, and was the mother of Baldwin IV and Sibylla. In 1164 Joscelin was taken captive by Nur ad-Din Zengi at the Battle of Harim. He remained a prisoner until 1176 when Agnes paid his ransom of 50,000 dinars, probably with support from the royal treasury. His nephew Baldwin then made him seneschal of Jerusalem. He faced some rivalry from the king's paternal kindred, led by Raymond III, Count of Tripoli. Chastel Neuf, or King's castle, in Mi'ilya, in 2009 In 1180 Joscelin went as an ambassador to the Byzantine Empire. After the betrothal of Baldwin's half-sister Isabella to Humphrey IV of Toron that year, the Toron estates passed to the crown in exchange for a money fief. Baldwin IV granted part of them, Chastel Neuf, to Joscelin, and awarded Agnes an income from the usufruct, or produce, of Toron. Agnes died in late 1184, a few months before her son. In 1185, Joscelin became guardian of his young great-nephew, Baldwin V, while Raymond III was regent. Raymond feared that, if he were the child's personal guardian, he would be blamed if he died in his care, because he had a claim to the throne himself. Joscelin, as the king's maternal grandmother's brother, had no claim, but rather had strong family interests in keeping him alive. Additional support came with the arrival of Baldwin's paternal grandfather, William V of Montferrat, from Italy. However, Baldwin seems to have been sickly, and died at Acre in 1186. Joscelin and William escorted his coffin to Jerusalem. Meanwhile, Raymond went to Nablus to attempt a coup with Balian of Ibelin to install Isabella as queen. This failed, and Sibylla was crowned, also crowning her second husband, Guy of Lusignan. In 1186, Guy and Sibylla granted Chastel Neuf and Toron, with other territory, to Joscelin. He, in turn, gave them as the dowry of his elder daughter, Beatrice, whom he betrothed to Guy‚Äôs younger brother, William of Valence. Her younger sister, Agnes, was to marry one of Guy‚Äôs nephews, but if Beatrice died while still a minor, William was to marry Agnes instead. At the Battle of Hattin in 1187, Joscelin commanded the rearguard with Balian of Ibelin. Both escaped the disastrous defeat and fled to Tyre. All his estates were captured by Saladin. Joscelin joined in the siege of Acre in the Third Crusade. He last witnessed a charter on 25 October 1190, after Sibylla's death. There is a strong likelihood that he died during the siege. A month later, Isabella, who was now claiming the crown from Guy, restored Humphrey of Toron's claim to Chastel Neuf and Toron (should they be reconquered) when she accepted the annulment of their marriage. If Joscelin was still alive, he made no recorded objection. However, this seems to have ended the prospect of his daughters' Lusignan marriages. He was definitely dead by October 1200. Joscelin's seigneurie was acquired by the Teutonic Knights, in 1220.Strehlke, 1869, pp. 43-44, No. 53; pp. 47-49, Nos. 58-59; Cited in R√∂hricht, 1893, RRH, p. 248, No. 934; Cited Frankel, 1988, p. 259 Marriage and children After his release from captivity in 1176, Joscelin married Agnes of Milly, (de) third daughter of Henry \\"the Buffalo\\" of Milly, (de) Lord of Petra, (and a sister of Stephanie of Milly and Helvis de Milly (fr)); by whom he had two daughters: # Beatrix de Courtenay (d. aft. 1245), betrothed to William of Valence, brother of Guy of Lusignan, in 1186, but married Otto von Botenlauben # Agnes de Courtenay, betrothed to a nephew of Guy of Lusignan in 1186, but married, by 1200, William of Amandolea, a Norman from Calabria, who became Lord of Scandeleon References Sources   *Nielen, Marie-Adela√Øde (ed.), Lignages d'Outremer.

Latin- script trigraphs For example, in the word schilling, the trigraph sch represents the voiceless postalveolar fricative , rather than the consonant cluster . In the word beautiful, the sequence eau is pronounced , and in the French word ch√¢teau it is pronounced . It is sometimes difficult to determine whether a sequence of letters in English is a trigraph, because of the complicating role of silent letters. There are however a few productive trigraphs in English such as tch as in watch, and igh as in high. The trigraph sch in German is equivalent to the English sh and pronounced . In the Dutch language, which is closely related to German, this same trigraph is pronounced . In Italian, however, sch represents the sounds before e or i, as in \\"bruschetta\\" . In neither language is this trigraph regarded as an independent letter of the alphabet. In Hungarian, the trigraph dzs is treated as a distinct letter, with its own place in the alphabet. It is pronounced like an English \\"j\\" . The combination gli in Italian can also be a trigraph, representing the palatal lateral approximant before vowels other than i, as in aglio, pronounced . Trigraphs in non-Latin scripts Although trigraphs are not uncommon in Latin-script alphabets, they are rare elsewhere. There are several in Cyrillic alphabets, which for example uses five trigraphs and a tetragraph in the Kabardian alphabet: –≥—ä—É , –∫”è—É , –∫—ä—É , –∫—Ö—ä , and —Ö—ä—É , and also a tetragraph –∫—Ö—ä—É . While most of these can be thought of as consonant + , the letters in –∫—Ö—ä cannot be so separated: the —Ö has the negative meaning that –∫—Ö—ä is not ejective, as –∫—ä is . (See List of Cyrillic digraphs.) Tsakonian has œÑœÉœá . The orthography used for the Yiddish language by YIVO uses the Hebrew script trigraph ◊ì◊ñ◊© (dalet, zayin, shin) to refer to . Hangul has a few vowel trigraphs, „Öô and „Öû (from oai and uei), which are not entirely predictable. However, as „Öê and „Öî are considered as single letters in modern Korean, „Öô and „Öû are considered as digraphs now. There is also a single obsolete consonant trigraph, „Öπ, a theoretical form not actually found in any texts. It is composed of digraph „ÖÉ and a circle-shaped single letter „Öá, which means the letter \\"to lighten\\" sounds, linguistically to change stop consonants to the fricative consonants in cases of bilabial consonants (for ·Ñõ, „Öá changes alveolar tap to alveolar lateral approximant or retroflex lateral approximant). Because these letters are created to transcribe consonants of Mandarin (late imperial lingua franca), these are disappeared soon. In modern days, „ÖÉ is used for different sound, [p ∞]. Japanese kana use trigraphs for (C)y≈ç sequences, as in „Åç„Çá„ÅÜ kyou (\\"today\\"); the „ÅÜ is only pronounced after another . In Inuktitut syllabics, the digraph ·ñï ng cannot be followed by a vowel. For that, it must form a trigraph with g: :·ô∞ ≈ãai, ·ñè ≈ãi, ·ñë ≈ãu, ·ñì ≈ãa. It also forms a trigraph with n for ≈ã≈ã: ·ññ. Discontinuous (split) trigraphs The sequence of letters making up a phoneme are not always adjacent. This is the case with English silent e, which has been claimed to modify preceding digraphs as well as preceding single vowel letters. For example, the sequence ou...e has the sound in English joule. There are twelve such combinations in English, ,John Mountford (1998) An Insight Into English Spelling though it has been argued that a trigraph analysis is unnecessary.Brooks (2015) Dictionary of the British English Spelling System, p. 463 The Indic alphabets are distinctive for their discontinuous vowels, such as Thai ‡πÅ...‡∏∞ , ‡πÄ...‡∏≤‡∏∞ , ‡πÄ...‡∏≠‡∏∞ . Technically, however, these may be considered diacritics, not full letters; whether they are trigraphs is thus a matter of definition, though they can in turn take modifying vowel diacritics, as in ‡πÄ‚óå‡∏µ‡∏¢‡∏∞ and ‡πÄ‚óå‡∏∑‡∏≠‡∏∞ .

Cape Maleas (also Cape Malea; , colloquially ŒöŒ±Œ≤ŒøŒºŒ±ŒªŒπŒ¨œÇ, Cavomali√°s), anciently Malea ()E.g., and Maleae or Maleai (ŒúŒ±ŒªŒ≠Œ±Œπ), is a peninsula and cape in the southeast of the Peloponnese in Greece. To distinguish it from the cape, the peninsula is sometimes referred to as \\"Epidavros Limira\\" peninsula, after the most prominent ancient city located on it. It separates the Laconian Gulf in the west from the Aegean Sea in the east. It is the second most southerly point of mainland Greece (after Cape Matapan) and once featured one of the largest light-houses in the Mediterranean. The seas around the cape are notoriously treacherous and difficult to navigate, featuring variable weather and occasionally very powerful storms. Geography Cape Maleas topography. Cape Maleas is in the regional unit of Laconia. The municipality of Monemvasia covers the entire peninsula and part of the eastern coast. The municipal unit of Voies () is located in the southern extremity of the peninsula, with Neapoli, the largest town on the peninsula. To the west of the peninsula lies the island of Elafonisos, known for its long, light-coloured sandy beaches. History In ancient times it was a busy shipping lane, and one of the major routes for crossing from the northeast Mediterranean to the west. The cape was notorious for its bad weather at the time as well, most famously as recounted in the Odyssey. Homer describes how Odysseus on his return home to Ithaca rounds Cape Maleas only to be blown off course, resulting in his being lost for up to 10 years by some people's reckoning. The Cape's importance declined with the opening of the Corinth Canal, which allowed ships to bypass the Peloponnese rather than circumnavigating it. However, it still has significant amounts of sea traffic as the Corinth Canal can only accommodate ships less than 21m in width. In World War II, the German occupying forces began construction of a military tower for defense and surveillance of the major shipping lane. The construction was halted with the end of occupation in 1944.

A friendly society (sometimes called a mutual society, benevolent society, fraternal organization or ROSCA) is a mutual association for the purposes of insurance, pensions, savings or cooperative banking. It is a mutual organization or benefit society composed of a body of people who join together for a common financial or social purpose. Before modern insurance and the welfare state, friendly societies provided financial and social services to individuals, often according to their religious, political, or trade affiliations. These societies are still widespread in many parts of the developing world, where they are referred to as ROSCAs (rotating savings and credit associations), ASCAs (accumulating savings and credit associations), burial societies, chit funds, etc. Character Before the development of large-scale government and employer health insurance and other financial services, friendly societies played an important part in many people's lives. Many of these societies still exist. In some countries, some of them developed into large mutually-run financial institutions, typically insurance companies, and lost any social and ceremonial aspect they may have had; in others they continue to have a role based on solidarity and democracy without an objective to make profit. The current position of the mutual benefit society in Europe is well described in a report from 2012, commissioned by the European Commission. Healthcare mutuals worldwide are coming together in Association Internationale de la Mutualit√©, a Brussels- based association of healthcare mutuals. =Great Britain= Friendly societies in countries such as Great Britain were subject to prudential regulation to safeguard the financial interests of their members and secure the benefits promised to them, but the legislation (see for example Friendly Societies Act 1875) was separate from that applicable to insurance companies. In other countries friendly societies have no specific legal status, which means that they have to comply to the same rules and regulations as for-profit insurance companies.P.H. Gosden, The friendly societies in England, 1815-1875 (Manchester University Press, 1961). In some cases, especially in America, members typically paid a regular membership fee and went to lodge meetings to take part in ceremonies. If members became sick, they would receive an allowance to help them meet their financial obligations. The society might have a doctor whom the member could consult for free. Members of the lodge would visit to provide emotional and other support (and possibly to verify that the sick member was not malingering). When a member died, the funeral would be paid for and the members of the lodge might attend in ceremonial dress. Often, there was some money left over for the next of kin. Friendly societies might also organize social functions such as dances, and some had sports teams for members. They occasionally became involved in political issues that were of interest to their members. Others were purely financial, with little or no social side, from their foundation‚Äîthis was more typical in Great Britain. The first mutual savings bank, founded in Scotland in 1810, was called the \\"Savings and Friendly Society\\". Credit unions and other types of organization are modern equivalents. Friendly Society Brasses were the emblems of village friendly societies or clubs common in the west of England between the late 18th and early 20th centuries. The use of brasses as emblems was particularly prevalent in Somerset and the surrounding counties. The Museum of English Rural Life has a collection of over 900 Friendly Society Brasses aka poleheads. The design of the brasses was sometimes conventional or sometimes represented an interest of the club such as the inn in which the meetings were held .  Female friendly societies  Female friendly societies were a common form of friendly society in England during the 19th century e.g. the York Female Friendly Society, founded in 1788 by Faith Gray and Catherine Cappe. Grey and Cappe ran schools for girls and this society was intended to assist them. Registration and regulation =Republic of Ireland= In Ireland, friendly societies are registered with the Registrar of Friendly Societies under the Friendly Societies Acts 1896‚Äì2014 (the Registrar for Companies is also the Registrar for Friendly Societies, Industrial and Provident Societies and Trade Unions).Companies Registration Office, 2013. Retrieved 8 April 2015. In 2014 the Friendly Societies and Industrial and Provident Societies (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2014, provided for the cessation of new friendly societies; as a result no new societies may be registered.Cessation of Friendly Society registration in Ireland, IrishStatuteBook.ie It was felt that the form of organisation had outlived its usefulness, largely for reasons mentioned above. When the minister's staff examined the register, it was found that only three new societies had registered in the previous nine years, as the use of the traditional friendly society types of business had become regulated elsewhere and a 'rump', which on examination are largely public- service types, remain (mainly army, customs, garda√≠, and prison officers). Many of the others could expect to cease to trade if additional, or a normal regulatory environment was required (similar to companies, health and other business (loan organisations).Seanad √âireann - 02/Apr/2014 Food Provenance Bill 2013: Leave to Withdraw (Continued) The 2014 Act also provided that existing societies may not establish a 'loan fund' from the commencement of the Act (July 28, 2014).http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/pdf/2014/en.si.2014.0356.pdf =United Kingdom= Friendly societies are registered under either the Friendly Societies Act 1974 or the Friendly Societies Act 1992. There are the following types of society registered under the Friendly Societies Act 1974: * friendly societies * working men‚Äôs clubs * benevolent societies * cattle insurance societies * specially authorised societies The activities of these societies varies, but includes: * running a social club * providing discretionary benefits to members ‚Äì for instance during sickness or unemployment * running sports clubs * managing allotments * insuring cattle Some friendly societies are still governed by the 1974 Act, although no new societies can be registered under that act. Friendly societies registered under the Friendly Societies Act 1992 are incorporated entities and are registered for effecting and carrying out contracts of insurance. Similar organisations were called industrial and provident societies. They are trading businesses or voluntary organisations. Recent legal developments in Great Britain include the Co- operative and Community Benefit Societies Act 2014, which has renamed these societies as co-operative or community benefit societies. Examples include co- operatives for consumers, workers, agriculture and housing, working men's clubs, Women's Institute markets, allotment societies, mutual investment companies, housing associations and some social enterprises. Many sports clubs are registered under these provisions. Friendly societies, alongside other mutual societies, are registered with the Financial Conduct Authority. Until December 2001, the regulator was the Registrar of Friendly Societies, and from then until April 2013 the Financial Services Authority.

Heilbroner (March 24, 1919 ‚Äì January 4, 2005) was an American economist and historian of economic thought. The author of some 20 books, Heilbroner was best known for The Worldly Philosophers: The Lives, Times and Ideas of the Great Economic Thinkers (1953), a survey of the lives and contributions of famous economists, notably Adam Smith, Karl Marx, and John Maynard Keynes. Biography Heilbroner was born in 1919, in New York City, to a wealthy German Jewish family. His father, Louis Heilbroner, was a businessman who founded the men's clothing retailer Weber & Heilbroner.Canterbery, E. Ray, A Brief History of Economics: Artful Approaches to the Dismal Science (2001). Robert graduated from Harvard University in 1940 with a summa cum laude degree in philosophy, government and economics. During World War II, he served in the United States Army and worked at the Office of Price Control under John Kenneth Galbraith, the highly celebrated and controversial Institutionalist economist. After the war, Heilbroner worked briefly as a banker and entered into academia in the 1950s as a research fellow at the New School for Social Research. During this period, he was highly influenced by the German economist Adolph Lowe, who was a foremost representative of the German Historical School. In 1963, Heilbroner earned a Ph.D. in Economics from the New School for Social Research, where he was subsequently appointed Norman Thomas Professor of Economics in 1971, and where he remained for more than twenty years. He mainly taught History of Economic Thought courses at the New School. Although a highly unconventional economist, who regarded himself as more of a social theorist and \\"worldly philosopher\\" (philosopher pre-occupied with \\"worldly\\" affairs, such as economic structures), and who tended to integrate the disciplines of history, economics and philosophy, Heilbroner was nevertheless recognized by his peers as a prominent economist. He was elected Vice President of the American Economic Association in 1972. He also came up with a way of classifying economies, as either Traditional (primarily agriculturally based, perhaps subsistence economy), Command (centrally planned economy, often involving the state), Market (capitalism), or Mixed. Though an outspoken socialist for nearly his entire career, Heilbroner famously wrote in a 1989 New Yorker article prior to the collapse of the Soviet Union: :Less than 75 years after it officially began, the contest between capitalism and socialism is over: capitalism has won... Capitalism organizes the material affairs of humankind more satisfactorily than socialism. He further wrote in Dissent in 1992 that \\"capitalism has been as unmistakable a success as socialism has been a failure\\"\\"404 Not Found\\". and complimented Milton Friedman, Friedrich Hayek, and Ludwig von Mises on their insistence of the free market's superiority. He emphasized that \\"democratic liberties have not yet appeared, except fleetingly, in any nation that has declared itself to be fundamentally anticapitalist.\\" However, Heilbroner's preferred capitalist model was the highly redistributionist welfare states of Scandinavia; he stated that his model society was \\"a slightly idealized Sweden.\\"Lind, Michael (June 15, 2010). \\"Why do conservatives want to European-ize America?\\". Salon. Heilbroner died in 2005 in New York City at the age of 85. Family Robert Heilbroner had two sons, David and Peter Heilbroner, and four grandchildren, Quentin, Katrina, Henry, and Sam.  The Worldly Philosophers  Published in 1953, The Worldly Philosophers: The Lives, Times and Ideas of the Great Economic Thinkers (1953) has sold nearly four million copies, making it the second- best-selling economics text of all time (the first being Paul Samuelson's Economics, a highly popular university textbook). The seventh edition of the book, published in 1999, included a new final chapter entitled \\"The End of Worldly Philosophy?\\", which included both a grim view on the current state of economics as well as a hopeful vision for a \\"reborn worldly philosophy\\" that incorporated social aspects of capitalism.

It can be applied to individuals or groups. Common targets are public officials, politicians, political candidates, activists and ex-spouses. The term also applies in other contexts such as the workplace.Jay C. Thomas, Michel Hersen (2002) Handbook of Mental Health in the Workplace The term smear campaign became popular around 1936. Definition A smear campaign is an intentional, premeditated effort to undermine an individual's or group's reputation, credibility, and character. Like negative campaigning, most often smear campaigns target government officials, politicians, political candidates, and other public figures. However, private persons or groups may also become targets of smear campaigns perpetrated in companies, institutions, the legal system, and other formal groups. Smear tactics differ from normal discourse or debate in that they do not bear upon the issues or arguments in question. A smear is a simple attempt to malign a group or an individual with the aim of undermining their credibility. Smears often consist of ad hominem attacks in the form of unverifiable rumors and distortions, half-truths, or even outright lies; smear campaigns are often propagated by gossip magazines. Even when the facts behind a smear campaign are demonstrated to lack proper foundation, the tactic is often effective because the target's reputation is tarnished before the truth is known. Smear campaigns can also be used as a campaign tactic associated with tabloid journalism, which is a type of journalism that presents little well-researched news and instead uses eye- catching headlines, scandal-mongering and sensationalism. For example, during Gary Hart's 1988 presidential campaign (see below), the New York Post reported on its front page big, black block letters: \\"GARY: I'M NO WOMANIZER.\\"William Safire. (May 3, 1987). \\"On Language; Vamping Till Ready\\". The New York Times.Matt Bai. All The Truth Is Out: The Week That Politics Went Tabloid. Knopf (September 30, 2014) Smears are also effective in diverting attention away from the matter in question and onto a specific individual or group. The target of the smear typically must focus on correcting the false information rather than on the original issue. Deflection has been described as a wrap-up smear: \\"You make up something. Then you have the press write about it. And then you say, everybody is writing about this charge\\". Smear tactics are considered by many to be a low, disingenuous form of discourse; they are nevertheless very common. Cluster B Smear campaigns have been identified as a common weapon of psychopaths,Junie Moon (2012) Surviving the Predators Among Us Borderlines and narcissists.S. Nightshade (2016) A Pre-Book and a Victim's Guide to Surviving the NarcissistBailey-Rug C (2016) It's Not You, It's Them: When People Are More Than SelfishJoseph Burgo (2016). The Narcissist You Know: Defending Yourself Against Extreme Narcissists in an All- About-Me Age Legality In many countries, the law recognizes the value of reputation and credibility. Both libel (a false and damaging publication) and slander (a false and damaging oral statement) are often punishable by law and may result in imprisonment or compensation or fees for damages done. Targets Smear tactics are commonly used to undermine effective arguments or critiques. =John C. Fr√©mont ‚Äì 1856 US presidential election candidate= During the 1856 presidential election, John C. Fr√©mont was the target of a smear campaign alleging that he was a Catholic. The campaign was designed to undermine support for Fremont from those who were suspicious of Catholics. \\"The Great Republican Reform Party Calling on their Candidate\\", an 1856 print which is a political cartoon about John C. Fr√©mont, the first Republican party candidate for president of the United States. There was a political campaign smear rumor current in 1856 that Fremont was a Catholic (the purpose of which was to prevent Fremont from gaining support from those who were suspicious of Catholics). =General Motors against Ralph Nader= Ralph Nader was the victim of a smear campaign during the 1960s, when he was campaigning for car safety. In order to smear Nader and deflect public attention from his campaign, General Motors engaged private investigators to search for damaging or embarrassing incidents from his past. In early March 1966, several media outlets, including The New Republic and The New York Times, reported that GM had tried to discredit Nader, hiring private detectives to tap his phones and investigate his past and hiring prostitutes to trap him in compromising situations.

Her keel was laid down on 27 August 1942 by the Electric Boat Company of Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 23 May 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Ezra G. Allen, wife of Rear Admiral Ezra G. Allen, Budget Officer of the Navy Department, and commissioned on 28 August 1943, Lieutenant Commander Earle Caffrey Schneider in command. Service history Dorados sea trials proved the readiness of the crew, and she sailed from New London, Connecticut, on 6 October 1943 for the Panama Canal Zone. She did not arrive. The standard practice of imposing bombing restrictions within an area ahead, astern, and on each side of the scheduled position of an unescorted submarine making passage in friendly waters had been carried out and all concerned had been notified. However, the crew of a PBM Mariner of Patrol Squadron 210 out of Guant√°namo Bay, Cuba, assigned to provide air coverage on the evening of 12 October had received an incorrect description of the restriction area, out of place. At 2049 local time, under a moon-lit but stormy sky, that plane attacked an unidentified submarine that it believed was outside the restriction area with three Mark-47 depth charges and a Mark-4 Mod-4 demolition bomb. About two hours later, the plane sighted a second submarine with which it attempted to exchange recognition signals. This second submarine fired upon the plane. A convoy scheduled to pass through the restricted area surrounding Dorado on the evening of 12 October reported no contact. Air searches were begun immediately after 14 October, her scheduled date of arrival. Widely scattered oil slicks with occasional debris were found. Subsequently, the Board of Investigation held in Guant√°namo Bay, and the more formal Naval Board of Inquiry held at the Washington Navy Yard, found that the \\"widely scattered oil slicks\\" were actually oleous in nature and not bunker oil or fuel - most probably rotting vegetation like seaweed. All of the \\"occasional debris\\" was determined not to have come from Dorado. At both the Board of Investigation and the Court of Inquiry, the aircrew testified that they were certain that both submarines they had attacked were U-boats. Despite the circumstantial evidence, there are reasons to doubt that Dorado was sunk by the Mariner.www.lostsubs.com - USS Dorado (SS-248) Because the crew knew that Dorado was operating in the area, they carefully observed their two targets before attacking. Prior to the first attack, the four crewmen of the aircraft observed the surfaced submarine for 12 minutes, noting: * it was from where they had been told to expect Dorado to be and from where Dorado really was supposed to be * it was heading almost 90 degrees off from Dorado‚Äôs base course * it had no guns on the fore deck where Dorado carried a five-inch (127 mm) gun * it had an entirely grooved deck where Dorados deck was grooved only near the conning tower * it had a \\"knob-like\\" object on the front of the conning tower, almost certainly the Biscay Cross radar detector installed on Type IX U-boats FuMB-1 Metox-U-boat radar detector antenna, similar to the Biscay Cross. Post-war examination of Kriegsmarine records indicate that the submarine first attacked by the Mariner may have been , though that boat's logs do not record the attack. It is possible that the attack went unnoticed by the boat; of the three depth charges and one 100-pound bomb that were dropped, one depth charge was a confirmed dud, one was dropped too low to arm, and neither the third depth charge nor the bomb were seen to explode. After the attack, the Mariner searched the area for 20 minutes, but saw no explosions, bubbles, or debris. The second submarine, attacked by the Mariner two hours later, was certainly U-214; her log book, captured after World War II, describes firing at the aircraft. On 8 October, five miles off Col√≥n, U-214 laid a minefield of 15 mines. One of these may have sunk the USS Dorado on or about 14 October. Legacy A memorial to Dorado has been constructed in the Veterans Memorial Park in Wichita, Kansas on the Arkansas River. A 614-page book entitled \\"USS DORADO (SS-248): On Eternal Patrol\\" was published by Douglas E. Campbell in November 2011.

She was acknowledged by Pope Stephen III as the wife of Charlemagne, however, is often referred to as a concubine. Life Little is known about Himiltrude's origins. Paulus Diaconus calls her a \\"noble girl\\".Silvia Konecny, Die Frauen des karolingischen K√∂nigshauses. Die politische Bedeutung der Ehe und die Stellung der Frau in der fr√§nkischen Herrscherfamilie vom 7. bis zum 10. Jahrhundert., p. 65 . The appearance of her name in the fraternity books of Alemannian monasteries may suggest an affiliation with the Germanic Alemannian or Alsatian nobility,Dieter H√§germann, Karl der Gro√üe. Herrscher des Abendlands, Ullstein 2003, p. 82f. while other sources make her the daughter of a Burgundian count and a granddaughter of Grimbert I, Count of Paris. It is not possible, however, to extrapolate any political ramifications from Charlemagne's relationship with Himiltrude. Himiltrude probably entered into a relationship with Charlemagne during the lifetime of his father, Pepin the Younger. When Charlemagne acceded to the throne in 768, Himiltrude remained unnamed in official sources - contrary to the example set by Charlemagne's mother, Bertrada of Laon. Himiltrude bore Charles a son called P√©pin. Shortly after Pepin's birth, an alliance was formulated between Charlemagne and the King of the Lombards, Desiderius. To seal the alliance, it was agreed that Charlemagne should marry Desiderius' daughter (called Desiderata by modern scholars). Himiltrude was dismissed at that time and disappears from historical records. A grave excavated in the monastery of Nivelles was found to contain the corpse of a forty-year-old woman, possibly identifiable with Himiltrude. If so, Himiltrude would appear to have died long after 770, although if and when she retired to Nivelles cannot be deduced. Her son P√©pin, who suffered from a spinal deformity and was called \\"the Hunchback\\", was eclipsed by Charlemagne's sons from his later marriage to Hildegard. Following an attempted rebellion against his father, Pepin was confined to a monastery. Marital status The nature of Himiltrude's relationship to Charlemagne is a matter of dispute. Charlemagne's biographer Einhard calls her a \\"concubine\\"Einhard, Vita Karoli Magni, ch. 20 and Paulus Diaconus speaks of Pippin's birth \\"before legal marriage\\", whereas a letter by Pope Stephen III refers to Charlemagne and his brother Carloman as being already married (to Himiltrude and Gerberga), and advises them not to dismiss their wives. Historians have interpreted the information in different ways. Some, such as Pierre Rich√©, follow Einhard in describing Himiltrude as a concubine.Pierre Rich√©, The Carolingians, p.86. Others, Dieter H√§gemann for example, consider Himiltrude a wife in the full sense. Still others subscribe to the idea that the relationship between the two was \\"something more than concubinage, less than marriage\\" and describe it as a Friedelehe, a supposed form of marriage unrecognized by the Church and easily dissolvable. This form of relationship is often seen in a conflict between Christian marriage and more flexible Germanic concepts.

Life Fastrada was born circa 765 at Ingelheim, the daughter of the powerful East Frankish Count Rudolph (also called Eadolf), and his wife, Aeda. Fastrada became the third wife of Charlemagne,As described by historians such as Pierre Rich√© (The Carolingians, p.86.), Lewis Thorpe (Two Lives of Charlemagne, p.216) and others. Other historians list Himiltrude, described by Einhard as a concubine, as Charlemagne's first wife, and reorder his subsequent wives; accordingly Fastrada is sometimes numbered as his fourth wife.

A probable reason behind the marriage was to solidify a Frankish alliance east of the Rhine when Charles was still fighting the Saxons. Due to her influence Pepin the Hunchback, son of Charlemagne and Himiltrude, was publicly tonsured after an attempted rebellion against his father. Fastrada soon won a reputation for cruelty, though contemporary sources suggest that she played an active role alongside her husband. Fastrada died on 10 August 794 in Frankfurt (in present-day Germany), during the synod of Frankfurt and was buried in St. Alban's Abbey, Mainz, long before the abbey was finished. Due to Archbishop Richulf's influence, she was not buried in the Basilique Saint-Denis, the burial site of almost all the Frankish and French monarchs, nor St. Arnulf's Abbey near Metz.

Early life Adonis was born Giuseppe Antonio Doto in the small town of Montemarano, Province of Avellino, Italy, to Michele Doto and Maria De Vito. He had three brothers, Antonio, Ettore and Genesio Doto. In 1909, Adonis and his family immigrated to the United States, in New York City. As a young man, Adonis supported himself by stealing and picking pockets. While working on the streets, Adonis became friends with future mob boss Charles \\"Lucky\\" Luciano and mobster Settimo Accardi, who were involved in illegal gambling. Adonis developed a loyalty to Luciano that lasted for decades. At the beginning of Prohibition, Luciano, Adonis, Meyer Lansky and Bugsy Siegel started a bootlegging operation in Brooklyn. This operation soon began supplying large amounts of alcohol to the show business community along Broadway in Manhattan. Doto soon assumed the role of a gentleman bootlegger, socializing with the theater elite. In the early 1920s, Doto started calling himself \\"Joe Adonis\\" (Adonis was the Greek god of beauty and desire). It is uncertain as to what inspired his nickname. One story states that Adonis received this nickname from a Ziegfeld Follies chorus girl who was dating him. Another story says that Adonis adopted the name after reading a magazine article on Greek mythology. Extremely vain, Adonis spent a great deal of time in personal grooming. On one occasion, Lucky Luciano saw Adonis combing his thick, dark hair in front of a mirror and asked him, \\"Who do you think you are, Rudolph Valentino?\\" Adonis replied, \\"For looks, that guy's a bum!\\". Adonis was a cousin of Luciano crime family capo Alan Bono, who supervised Adonis's operations in Greenwich Village, Manhattan. Adonis married Jean MontemoranoJoe Adonis' marriage certificate, and he had four children; Joseph Michael Doto, Maria Dolores Olmo, Ann Marie Arietta, and Elizabeth Doto. Castellammarese War In the 1920s, Adonis became an enforcer for Frankie Yale, the boss of some rackets in Brooklyn. While working for Yale, Adonis briefly met future Chicago Outfit boss Al Capone, who was also working for Yale. Meanwhile, Luciano became an enforcer for Giuseppe \\"Joe the Boss\\" Masseria. Masseria soon became embroiled in the vicious Castellammarese War with his archrival, Salvatore Maranzano. Maranzano represented the Sicilian clans, most of which came from Castellammare del Golfo, Sicily. As the war progressed, both bosses started recruiting more soldiers. By 1930, Adonis had joined the Masseria faction. As the war turned against Masseria, Luciano secretly contacted Maranzano about switching sides. When Masseria heard about Luciano's betrayal, he approached Adonis about killing Luciano. However, Adonis instead warned Luciano about the murder plot. On April 15, 1931, Adonis allegedly participated in Masseria's murder. Luciano had lured Masseria to a meeting at a Coney Island, Brooklyn, restaurant. During the meal, Luciano excused himself to go to the restroom. As soon as Luciano was gone, Adonis, Vito Genovese, Albert Anastasia, and Bugsy Siegel rushed into the dining room and shot Masseria to death.accessdate=March 19, 2020}} No one was ever indicted in the Masseria murder. With the death of Masseria, the war ended, and Maranzano was the victor. To avoid any future wars, Maranzano reorganized all the Italian American gangs into the Five Families and anointed himself as capo di tutti capi (\\"boss of all bosses\\"). Luciano and his loyalists quickly became dissatisfied with Maranzano's power grab. When Luciano discovered that the suspicious Maranzano had ordered his murder, Luciano struck first. On September 10, 1931, several gunmen attacked and killed Maranzano in his Manhattan office. Criminal empire Adonis and Luciano soon controlled bootlegging in Broadway and Midtown Manhattan. At its height, the operation grossed $12 million in one year and employed 100 workers. Adonis also bought car dealerships in New Jersey. When customers bought cars from his dealerships, the salesmen would intimidate them into buying \\"protection insurance\\" for the vehicle. Adonis soon moved into cigarette distribution, buying up vending machines by the hundreds and stocking them with stolen cigarettes. Adonis ran his criminal empire from Joe's Italian Kitchen, a restaurant that he owned in Brooklyn. By 1932, Adonis was also a major criminal power in Brooklyn. Despite his wealth, Adonis still participated in jewelry robberies, a throwback to his early criminal career on the streets. In 1932, Adonis allegedly participated in the kidnapping and brutal beating in Brooklyn of Isidore Juffe and Issac Wapinsky. In 1931, Adonis had lent the two men money for investment and kidnapped them in 1932 after deciding that he should be receiving a higher profit. Two days after the kidnappings, Adonis released Juffe and Wapinsky after receiving a $5,000 ransom payment. A month later, Wapinsky died of internal injuries from being assaulted. Adonis placed many politicians and high-ranking police officers on his payroll. Adonis used his political influence to assist members of the Luciano crime family, such as Luciano and Genovese, and mob associates such as Meyer Lansky and Louis \\"Lepke\\" Buchalter, the head of Murder, Inc. As a syndicate board member, Adonis, along with Buchalter, may have been responsible for assigning some murder contracts to Murder Inc.. Government scrutiny In 1936, prosecutors convicted Luciano on pandering charges and sent him to state prison for 30 years. Underboss Vito Genovese remained in charge of the family until he fled to Italy in 1937 to avoid a murder prosecution. Luciano now left Frank Costello, an Adonis ally, in charge of the Luciano family and Adonis in charge of the Syndicate. On April 27, 1940, Adonis was indicted in Brooklyn on charges of kidnapping, extortion, and assault in the 1932 Juffe/Wapinsky case. However, on February 24, 1941, the prosecutor requested a dismissal for lack of evidence. In the 1940s, Adonis moved his gambling rackets to New Jersey. New York City Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia's campaign against illegal gambling had made it too difficult to do business in New York. Adonis also moved his family to a luxurious house in Fort Lee, New Jersey. Adonis set up a casino in Lodi, New Jersey, and provided limousine service there from New York City. During the same period, Adonis became partners with Meyer Lansky in an illegal casino in Hallandale Beach, Florida. On February 10, 1946, after being escorted from prison to a ship in Brooklyn harbor, Luciano was deported to Italy. In December 1946, Adonis and Luciano met at the famous Havana Conference of US organized crime bosses in Cuba. It was Luciano's goal at the conference to regain his mob influence, using Cuba as a base. Being a loyal supporter, Adonis willingly agreed to turn over his power in the syndicate to Luciano. However, the US government soon discovered Luciano's presence in Havana and pressured the Cuban government to expel him. On February 24, 1947, Luciano was placed on a ship by Cuban authorities for deportation back to Italy. On December 12, 1950, Adonis was summoned before the US Senate Kefauver Commission on organized crime. Adonis repeatedly refused to testify, citing his right against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Although Adonis escaped contempt charges, he suffered undesirable national exposure as a mobster. In late May 1951, Adonis and several associates pleaded no contest to charges of operating three gambling rooms in Lodi, New Jersey, and Fort Lee, New Jersey. On May 28, 1951, Adonis was sentenced in Hackensack, New Jersey, to two to three years in state prison. Deportation and death On August 6, 1953, at a hearing in Adonis's prison, the US Department of Justice ordered Adonis's deportation to Italy. The government claimed that Adonis was an illegal alien. Adonis fought deportation, claiming that he was a native-born American citizen. On August 9, 1953, Adonis was released from prison in New Jersey. On January 3, 1956, Adonis voluntarily left New York City on an ocean liner for Naples, Italy. His wife and children stayed behind in New Jersey. Once in Italy, Adonis moved into a luxurious apartment in the center of Milan. Adonis may have met with Luciano in Naples, but there is no proof of it. Over time, the financially struggling Luciano grew angry at the wealthy Adonis for not helping him. On January 26, 1962, Luciano died of a heart attack in Naples at age 64. Adonis attended the funeral service in Naples, bringing a huge floral wreath with the words, \\"So Long, Pal\\". In June 1971, the Italian government forced Adonis to leave his Milan residence and move to Serra de' Conti, a small town near the Adriatic Sea. Adonis was one of 115 suspected mobsters relocated to Serra de' Conti after the assassination in May of the public prosecutor of Palermo, Sicily. In late November 1971, Italian police forces transported Adonis to a small hillside shack near Ancona, Italy, for interrogation. During the lengthy questioning and some abusive treatment, Adonis suffered a heart attack. Adonis was rushed to a regional hospital in Ancona, where he died several days later on November 26, 1971. =Aftermath= The U.S. Government allowed Adonis's family to bring his body back to the United States for burial. Adonis' funeral Mass was held at the Roman Catholic Church of the Epiphany in Cliffside Park, New Jersey, attended only by his immediate family. He is buried in Madonna Cemetery in Fort Lee.

History The Congregational Holiness Church shares the early history of the International Pentecostal Holiness Church, from which it withdrew. In 1920 a schism came into the Pentecostal Holiness Church over the relation of divine healing and the use of medicine. Some pastors believed Christians had the right to use medicine and doctors, while the majority of the church believed in trusting God for healing without the use of medicine and doctors. The minority withdrew and formed the Congregational Holiness Church. Led by Reverends Watson Sorrow and Hugh Bowling, a delegation from 12 churches met on January 29, 1921 at the church in High Shoals, Georgia to organize. The church was chartered in 1925 as the Southeastern Association of the Congregational Holiness Church and changed in 1965 to the Congregational Holiness Church, Inc.. The early leaders of the CHC attempted to democratize church government, preferring congregational rule over the Pentecostal Holiness Church's episcopal polity. In its beginning, the church had no officially elected leaders, and a General Conference was held every two years. In 1935, the structure of the denomination was changed. The church was divided into three districts, and in 1938 the office of General Superintendent was added. Foreign mission work began in the early 1950s. =Recent history= Offices are located in Griffin, Georgia. In addition to the United States, the Congregational Holiness Church has congregations in 34 countries including, but not limited to the following continents: Africa, Asia, North America, and South America. The Church now has eight districts: North Alabama, South Alabama, East Carolina, West Carolina, Central Georgia, North Georgia, Florida, Virginia, and a Hispanic Conference . USA Membership in 2013 was an estimated 29,000 in 275 churches. Partnership with the larger Pentecostal and evangelical communities is maintained through membership in the Pentecostal/Charismatic Churches of North America, the National Association of Evangelicals, and the Pentecostal World Fellowship. Beliefs Those who organized the new church believed that, although divine healing was a part of Christ's atonement, God had given the gift of medicine to mankind as well. Otherwise, the faith and practice of the Congregational Holiness Church is quite similar to the parent body. Doctrine includes belief in the Trinity; the inspiration of the Scriptures; the Baptism of the Holy Ghost with the initial evidence of speaking in tongues; the Virgin Birth of Jesus Christ; the death, burial and resurrection of Christ; and His imminent, personal, premillennial second coming. They hold three church ordinances, water baptism, the Lord's supper, and feet washing, as well as the operation of nine gifts of the Spirit. = Articles of faith = *There is but One Living and True God, the Great Creator, and there are three persons in the Godhead.

The General Conference elects the General Superintendent, which along with two Assistant General Superintendents, General Secretary, General Treasurer, and World Missions Superintendent. The following full-time officers, General Superintendent, World Missions Superintendent, and the appointed Mission USA Administrator, manage the day-to-day operations of the church. The nine districts elect five member presbyteries. The presbyters along with the general church officers form the General Committee. This committee handles the major business of the church between General Conferences. References *Handbook of Denominations in the United States, by Frank S. Mead, Samuel S. Hill, and Craig D.

His wife Bartolina Sisa and his sister Gregoria Apaza participated in the rebellion by his side.Kendall W. Brown, \\"T√∫pac Catari (Juli√°n Apaza)\\" in Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture, vol. 5, p. 280. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996. The rebellion was ultimately put down by Spanish loyalists and Katari was executed by quartering.  Biography  Tupac Katari's Wiphala Another of Tupac Katari's wiphalas Katari was born Juli√°n Apasa in the jurisdiction of Sicasica and later moved to the nearby town of Ayoayo. He was born a peasant and worked as a trader of coca and baize. A member of the Aymara, Apasa took the name \\"Tupac Katari\\" to honor two earlier rebel leaders: Tom√°s Katari, and T√∫pac Amaru II, executed by the Spanish in 1572. Katari's uprising was simultaneous with the Rebellion of T√∫pac Amaru II, whose cacique leader claimed to be a descendant of the earlier T√∫pac Amaru. T√∫pac Katari had no traditional claim to leadership similar to that of T√∫pac Amaru II, which may well have prompted Katari to associate himself with earlier leaders. Katari claimed authority from T√∫pac Amaru and proclaimed himself viceroy of the region. (\\"Katari\\" means \\"serpent, large snake\\" in Aymara; \\"Amaru\\" means the same in Quechua, the language of Tupac Amaru. \\"Tupac\\" means \\"brilliant, resplendent\\" in both languages.)Thompson, Sinclair (2002). We Alone Will Rule: Native Andean Politics in the Age of Insurgency, Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, p. 190. He raised an army of some 40,000 and laid siege to the city of La Paz in 1781. Katari and his wife Bartolina Sisa set up court in El Alto and maintained the siege from March to June and from August to October. Sisa was a commander of the siege, and played the crucial role following Katari's capture in April. The siege was broken by the Spanish colonial troops who advanced from Lima and Buenos Aires. During the siege, 20,000 people died. Katari laid siege again later in the year, this time joined by Andr√©s T√∫pac Amaru, nephew of T√∫pac Amaru II, but Katari lacked adequate forces to be successful. Katari had a reputation as a fierce and often violent leader. Other leaders in the rebel camps testified to his \\"homicides and enormous violence\\"; he was known not only for violence toward his enemies but also those who fought on his side, executing people for having \\"spoken against him, stolen his property, acted in an overweening fashion, challenged his authority, or humiliated him\\". On his death on 15 November 1781, Katari's final words were, according to oral tradition, \\".\\" This is translated from Aymara as \\"I die but will return tomorrow as thousand thousands\\".  Legacy  For his effort, his betrayal, defeat, torture and brutal execution (torn by his extremities into four pieces, or Quartering), T√∫pac Katari is remembered as a hero by modern indigenous movements in Bolivia, who call their political philosophy Katarismo. A Bolivian guerrilla group, the Tupac Katari Guerrilla Army, also bears his name. Bolivia's first satellite in orbit was named T√∫pac Katari 1.

She was launched on 16 May 1959 sponsored by Virginia McManes, wife of Rear Admiral Kenmore McManes, and commissioned on 15 October 1959, Lieutenant Commander Robert H. Gautier in command. She was the last non- nuclear submarine to join the United States Navy and was the final conventionally powered combat capable submarine to be decommissioned, leaving the United States Navy with a fully nuclear submarine fleet except for the research submarine .  Origin of the name  Sources differ on the origin of Bluebacks name. The Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships entry for Blueback states that she is named after a Other sources state that she is named after the  Service  = 1960s = After fitting out, Blueback got underway in January 1960 for a series of acceptance trials in the Gulf of Mexico. She completed that mission and departed Pascagoula on 11 June, bound for the Pacific. She transited the Panama Canal on 7 July and continued on to her home port, Naval Station San Diego. There she was assigned to Submarine Squadron 3 (SUBRON 3), Submarine Force, Pacific Fleet. Blueback then carried out torpedo tube acceptance trials at Keyport, Washington, and underwent a post-shakedown availability at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard. On 23 November 1960, the submarine was accepted for service. Type training in the San Diego area kept her busy into February 1961. On 11 February, she commenced a two- week availability at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard. Blueback got underway on 28 March for a deployment to the western Pacific during which she participated in 7th Fleet operations and exercises. The submarine left Yokosuka, Japan, on 3 September and sailed submerged to San Diego, arriving there on 25 September. After leave and upkeep, Blueback began type training exercises out of San Diego on 14 October. Four days later, she participated in a fleet exercise off the southern California coast conducted under the auspices of the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO). During the next eight months, the submarine took part in several fleet exercises and visited San Francisco, California, and Seattle, Washington. In July 1962, Blueback entered the Mare Island Naval Shipyard for her first major overhaul. Upon completion of the overhaul in January 1963, the submarine made port calls at Seattle and at Vancouver, British Columbia. She then left the west coast and proceeded to her new home port, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. There, the submarine was assigned to Submarine Division 13 (SUBDIV 13). Blueback was involved in local operations from February to early April. On 11 April, the submarine got underway for operations in WestPac. Blueback sailed to Australia to participate in the annual celebration of the anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea and visited Brisbane, Melbourne, and Perth. She then continued on to Subic Bay in the Philippines for operations with the 7th Fleet. While on her deployment, Blueback also called at Naha, Okinawa; and at Sasebo, Kobe, and Yokosuka, Japan, before returning to Pearl Harbor on 26 October. Blueback resumed her former routine in Hawaiian waters and continued local operations into 1964. In March, she suffered damage when a crane toppled over onto her while changing her propeller, necessitating a drydocking for repairs. In the fall and early winter, the submarine made two trips to the vicinity of Wake Island to take part in the evaluations of the SUBROC missile system and s. In each test, Blueback served as a target ship. On 17 February 1965, Blueback began her second deployment to the Far East. During the cruise, she made port calls at Naha, Hong Kong, Subic Bay, and Yokosuka, and also was involved in supporting American operations in Vietnam. She returned to Pearl Harbor in June, where she carried out local operations until 7 September. She got underway for Bremerton, Washington, on that day and entered the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard 18 days later for overhaul. The yard work ended on 26 September 1966, and the submarine commenced sound trials and weapons tests in Puget Sound. She also provided services for a research and development project conducted near Nanoose, Canada. After a four-day visit to Vancouver, she set sail for Pearl Harbor, where she arrived early in November and began refresher training. Following three months of preparations and training, Blueback embarked on another tour of duty in the western Pacific on 17 February 1967. During the seven-month assignment, she punctuated periods at sea training and supporting the American efforts in the Vietnam War with port calls at Hong Kong and in Japan at Yokosuka and Sasebo. The submarine returned to Oahu early that fall, arriving in Pearl Harbor on 20 September. After a month of leave and upkeep, she resumed operations in Hawaiian waters. On 19 December, she entered the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard for a restricted availability. In mid-January 1968, the submarine helped prospective commanding officers to prepare for their new assignments at the Pacific Fleet Submarine Force's school. She then acted as a target for several surface ships and aircraft to practice ASW techniques, and engaged in type training and weapons exercises. On 8 July, she began a five-month deployment to the Far East which, in addition to two special operations, also included much time spent in upkeep at Yokosuka. Blueback returned to Pearl Harbor on 3 December. = 1970s = Very early in 1969, she voyaged to Bremerton, and entered the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard on 17 January for an overhaul. During her subsequent sea trials and training, the submarine visited Nanaimo, British Columbia, and Port Angeles, Washington, before returning to Hawaii early in December. After intensive training during the first three months of 1970, Blueback set sail on her fifth deployment to the western Pacific on 10 April. She carried out lengthy special operations; made brief visits to Yokosuka, Hong Kong, and Guam; and spent time in the Vietnam war zone. The warship ended the cruise at Pearl Harbor on 1 October and began a period of local operations and upkeep. On 12 February 1971, she entered the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard for a restricted availability which concluded in late March with trials at sea. Early in April, she took part in SUBASWEX 1-71 in the Pearl Harbor area. After conducting torpedo firing exercises, Blueback entered upkeep at Pearl Harbor. She began another Far eastern assignment on 25 June and arrived at Yokosuka on 12 July for a week of upkeep before beginning a month of operational training at sea. The submarine next visited Sasebo for 10 days and then continued on to Hong Kong for a liberty period. Blueback traveled south to the Vietnam war zone to render training services to destroyer units of the 7th Fleet and then returned to Japan for upkeep at Yokosuka. On 11 October, the submarine got underway for more training at sea. She paused once again at Yokosuka before sailing for Hawaii on 29 November. She arrived back in her home port on 14 December. Local operations occupied her during the first 10 weeks of 1972; then, the submarine began a lengthy overhaul at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard on 29 March. Nearly a year later early in March 1973, she finished the yard work, commenced local operations and trained in preparation for deployment. She sailed for the Orient on 8 August and, while there, participated in several operations with other American warships as well as with naval forces from Korea and Taiwan. Among the ports she visited were Yokosuka and Sasebo, Japan; Chinhae and Pusan, Korea; Buckner Bay, Okinawa; Hong Kong; and Subic Bay in the Philippines. On 5 January 1974, Blueback left Subic Bay and visited Keelung, Taiwan, for two days before heading back to Hawaii. The submarine arrived in Pearl Harbor on 31 January 1974 and commenced a leave and upkeep period. During the remainder of the year, Blueback took part in numerous training operations and exercises. She provided services to surface ships and aircraft, conducted torpedo firing drills, and did another tour preparing prospective commanding officers for the new jobs. During the first two months of 1975, the submarine continued local operations. In March, she participated in Exercise \\"RIMPAC 75\\", which included ships from the navies of the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Upon completion of this operation, Blueback commenced a restricted availability. Early in June, she resumed local operations including a series of torpedo firing tests, type training, and services to surface and air units. The warship closed out the year in upkeep at Pearl Harbor. She held sea trials and weapons exercises in January 1976 and began another long overhaul at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard in February. She did not complete those repairs until 1 December. Blueback commenced refresher training 12 days later. In February 1977, she took part in Exercise \\"RIMPAC 77\\", then conducted torpedo trials. After a brief period of upkeep, the submarine departed Pearl Harbor on 28 March and proceeded to her new home port, San Diego, arriving there on 8 April. After an inspection and services to aircraft, she set out for San Francisco on 27 May, made a brief visit, and returned to San Diego on 1 June to prepare for duty overseas. On 21 June, the submarine got underway for Santa Marta, Colombia. Upon arriving there on 7 August, she joined Task Force 138 to participate in UNITAS XVIII. The task force also included , , and . During the deployment, Blueback visited ports in Colombia, Panama, Ecuador, Peru, and Chile. She departed Talcahuano, Chile, on 27 September and headed back to San Diego. She stopped at Rodman in the Panama Canal Zone, and made a four-day liberty call at Acapulco, Mexico, before reaching San Diego on 11 November. The submarine began 1978 in upkeep. She got underway on 13 February for a short visit to San Francisco, returned to San Diego on the 21st, and provided services to ships and aircraft in the San Diego area. From 23 April to 23 May, she underwent a battery replacement in preparation for an upcoming deployment. The ship sailed on 30 May for Portland, Oregon, where she represented the Submarine Force at that city's Rose Festival. She then continued north along the coast to conduct an exercise with Canadian forces off Esquimalt, British Columbia. Following this operation, Blueback arrived at Seattle on 23 June for a two-day liberty call before returning to San Diego. The submarine began a restricted availability on 17 July and, on 8 August, began final preparations for deployment. On 11 September, she got underway for her eighth western Pacific cruise. She touched at Pearl Harbor on the 22nd, but soon pressed on for Japan, and arrived at Yokosuka on 7 October. She next made a run to Chinhae, Korea, for two weeks of joint special warfare and ASW exercises with units of the South Korean Navy. On 5 November, Blueback arrived in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, to participate in ASW exercises with the Taiwanese Navy. From 14 to 24 November, she took part in a 7th Fleet exercise and then proceeded to Sasebo for a leave and upkeep period. Blueback then spent five days at Hong Kong from 6 to 11 December before heading on to Subic Bay where she arrived on 13 December to close out the year in upkeep. Blueback got underway on 5 January 1979 to provide target services for ships of the 7th Fleet undergoing ASW training. She then took part in special warfare exercises with Army Special Forces troops. On 22 January, the submarine arrived at Subic Bay for upkeep. Nine days later, she set out on a submerged voyage back to the United States and reached San Diego on 1 March. After a few weeks of leave and upkeep, the submarine took up local operations again and continued so engaged until beginning a tender availability on 14 May. She resumed local operations again on 12 June. Blueback sailed north on 18 August to visit Astoria, Oregon, and Seattle, Wash., returning to her home port early in September. Following a minelaying exercise off the southern California coast between 17 and 20 September, the submarine entered drydock on 1 October. She began sea trials on 27 November and then provided ASW services before closing the year in a holiday leave and upkeep status. = 1980s = USS Blueback at her mooring outside of OMSI on the Willamette River in Portland Ore. Blueback spent the first three and a half months of 1980 in local operations and exercises in preparation for overseas movement. Blueback departed San Diego on 15 April and completed her submerged transit of the Pacific at Okinawa on 11 May. The submarine then took part in ASW exercises in the Philippine Sea. She began upkeep at Yokosuka on 18 May and then got underway for special operations. Blueback began the month of June in upkeep at Sasebo but soon returned to sea to participate in joint exercises with South Korean forces. After another period of upkeep and liberty at Sasebo, she got underway on the 22nd for ASW operations in cooperation with the Japanese submarine Isoshio. At the conclusion of the exercise, Blueback visited Beppu, Japan, before heading for Subic Bay, where she arrived on 8 July. After upkeep, the submarine participated in an ASW exercise in the South China Sea with several ships of the 7th Fleet. On 22 July, Blueback began a six-day journey to Chinhae to take part in extensive exercises with the South Korean Navy. Early in August, the submarine visited Sasebo and Subic Bay. She conducted special warfare operations from 18 to 21 August and then entered port at San Fernando on northern Luzon. She got underway on 25 August for ASW operations with ships of the Royal Navy. After a final call at Subic Bay, the submarine began her voyage back to home port on 15 September. She entered San Diego on 15 October and began post-deployment leave and upkeep. Then came several days of type training in nearby waters followed by holiday leave and upkeep to close out the year. :[1980-1990]  Decommissioning and status  USS Blueback at her mooring on the Willamette River in Portland with the Marquam Bridge in the background. Blueback was decommissioned on 1 October 1990 and laid up in the Pacific Reserve Fleet in Bremerton, Washington. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 30 October 1990. With her removal from service, the last warship that was a diesel-electric submarine of the United States Navy had left the fleet, leaving the research submarine as the last diesel submarine of the US fleet. In February 1994 the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry (OMSI) towed Blueback to Portland, Oregon, where she now rests as an interactive part of the museum and a memorial. Her propeller was removed and installed outside the museum as a National Submarine Memorial. OMSI offers guided tours of the submarine several times a day. The vessel was added to the National Register of Historic Places in September 2008. The radio room has been restored by the USS Blueback Radio Club with both historic military radios and operational modern amateur radio gear which use the original military HF and VHF antennas. The submarine's radio call sign is now W7SUB.  Honors and awards  Blueback (SS-581) earned two battle stars for her Vietnam War service.  Popular culture  Blueback appeared in the episode \\"Samurai\\" of the 1970s television series Hawaii Five-O. Blueback appeared in the 1990 movie The Hunt for Red October, although she did not perform the famous stunt of an emergency main ballast tank blow during an emergency surfacing procedure seen in the film. A film crew was allowed on board to film a torpedo room scene and some of her crew were paid $50 (USD) each to have their hair cut and to put on Soviet Navy uniforms for the scene, but the scene was not included in the film. Blueback also is referred to in Season 2, episodes 10 and 11, of the TV show Portlandia. The Mayor of Portland, played by Kyle MacLachlan, is lost while kayaking on the Willamette River, and upon seeing Blueback says \\"Oh look, there's the submarine, I know where I am.\\" Blueback is visible in the far distance in the episode for approximately one-third of one second. Blueback was featured prominently in an episode of The Librarians, \\"And The Rise of Chaos\\", first aired on 20 November 2016.

He was the son of Constantine, Lord of Baberon (d. 1263) and Princess Alix Pahlavouni of Lampron (a third-cousin of Leo I) and was the founder of the dynasty which bears his name: the Hetoumids. Due to diplomatic relations with the Mongol Empire, Hethum himself traveled to the Mongol court in Karakorum, Mongolia, which was recorded in the famous account The Journey of Haithon, King of Little Armenia, To Mongolia and Back by Hetoum's companion, the Armenian historian Kirakos Gandzaketsi. Family Hethum's father Constantine had been regent for the young Queen Isabella of Armenia. Isabella originally married Philip (1222‚Äì1225), son of Bohemond IV of Antioch. However, Constantine had Philip disposed of, and instead forced Isabella to marry his own son, Hethum, on June 14, 1226, to make Isabella and Hethum co-rulers. The couple had six children: # Leo II (died 1289) # Thoros (died at the Battle of Mari in 1266 fighting the Mamluks) - Thoros had one child: Melkum. # Sibylla (died 1290), who married Bohemond VI of Antioch # Euphemie (died 1309), who married to Julian Grenier, Lord of Sidon # Rita of Armenia, married Constantine of Servantikar # Maria, who married Guy of Ibelin, son of Baldwin of Ibelin, Seneschal of Cyprus #Rouben #Vasak.

Miniature from \\"Histoire des Tartars\\", Hayton of Corycus, 1307. Hethum was a major player in the political struggles and shifting alliances around the Crusader states, as the Armenians had ties with all sides. They were primarily aligned with the Europeans, but during Hethum's reign, the rapidly expanding Mongol Empire became a concern. As the Mongols approached the borders of Cappadocia and Cilicia, King Hethum made a strategic decision to submit to Mongol suzerainty,Grousset, Empire, p. 263, \\"Hethum I (1226-69) was clever enough to place himself voluntarily under Mongol suzerainty in 1244.\\"Claude Mutafian in Le Royaume Arm√©nien de Cilicie describes \\"the Mongol alliance\\" entered into by the king of Armenia and the Franks of Antioch (\\"the King of Armenia decided to engage into the Mongol alliance, an intelligence that the Latin barons lacked, except for Antioch\\"), and \\"the Franco-Mongol collaboration\\" (Mutafian, p.55).Claude Lebedel in Les Croisades describes the alliance of the Franks of Antioch and Tripoli with the Mongols: (in 1260) \\"the Frank barons refused an alliance with the Mongols, except for the Armenians and the Prince of Antioch and Tripoli\\".Amin Maalouf in The Crusades through Arab eyes is extensive and specific on the alliance (page numbers refer to the French edition): \\"The Armenians, in the person of their king Hetoum, sided with the Mongols, as well as Prince Bohemond, his son-in-law. The Franks of Acre however adopted a position of neutrality favourable to the muslims\\" (p.261), \\"Bohemond of Antioch and Hethoum of Armenia, principal allies of the Mongols\\" (p.265), \\"Hulagu (‚Ä¶) still had enough strength to prevent the punishment of his allies [Bohemond and Hethoum]\\" (p.267). and sent his brother Sempad to the Mongol court in Karakorum. There, Sempad met Great khan G√ºy√ºk, and made a formal agreement in 1247 in which Cilician Armenia would be considered a vassal state of the Mongol Empire. In 1254, Hethum himself traveled through Central Asia to Mongolia to renew the agreement, passing through the Turkish states of eastern Asia Minor, the Mongol camp at Kars in Greater Armenia, the Iron Gates of Derbent at the western shore of the Caspian Sea, and from there across Asia to Karakorum.Bournotian, p. 101 He brought many sumptuous presents, and met with M√∂ngke Khan (G√ºy√ºk's cousin). The account of his travels was recorded by a member of his suite, Kirakos Gandzaketsi as \\"The Journey of Haithon, King of Little Armenia, To Mongolia and Back\\". The Journey of Hethoum was later translated into Russian, French, English,Emil Bretschneider tr., \\"The Journey of Haithon, King of Little Armenia, To Mongolia and Back\\", Mediaeval Researches Vol 1, Trubner Oriental Series 1888 London, facsimile reprint 2005 Elibron Classics and Chinese. The narrative is important for its observations of Mongol, Buddhist, and Chinese culture, geography, and wildlife. On his way back from Karakorum, Hethum passed through Samarkand and northern Persia, also visiting the Mongol leader Bayju, where he was present in his camp to witness Bayju's victory in Asia Minor against the Seljuq Turks.Claude Cahen, Pre- Ottoman Turkey, pp. 275‚Äì276 Hethum strongly encouraged other Frankish rulers to follow his example and submit to Mongol suzerainty, but the only one who did so was Hethum's son-in-law, Bohemond VI of Antioch, who submitted around 1259. Armenian troops were with the Mongol army that captured Baghdad in 1258, and both Armenians and Antiochenes fought in the Mongol Army under Hulagu at the Siege of Aleppo and Fall of Damascus in 1260.Grousset, p. 581\\"On 1 March Kitbuqa entered Damascus at the head of a Mongol army. With him were the King of Armenia and the Prince of Antioch. The citizens of the ancient capital of the Caliphate saw for the first time for six centuries three Christian potentates ride in triumph through their streets\\", Runciman, p.307 Historical accounts, quoting from the writings of the medieval historian Templar of Tyre, often give a dramatic account of the three Christian rulers (Hethum, Bohemond, and the Mongol general Kitbuqa) entering the city of Damascus together in triumph,Grousset, p.588 though modern historians have questioned this story as apocryphal.David Morgan, The Mongols (2nd ed.)Peter Jackson, \\"Crisis in the Holy Land in 1260\\", English Historical Review 376 (1980) 486\\"While this report cannot be taken literally, it may contain a grain of truth. Armenian troops were part of Ketbuqa's force, while some time during the Mongol occupation Bohemond visited Baalbek and even intended to ask Hulegu for possession of the town. (...) If this prince reached as far as Baalbek, it is most probable that he also passed through Damascus.\\" De Reuven Amitai-Preiss, Mongols and Mamluks, p.31 Despite the Mongol's territorial gains, in September 1260, the Egyptian Mamluks rallied, defeating the Mongols at the historic battle of Ain Jalut and driving them back across the Euphrates River. The Mongols would not again capture Syria until 1299‚Äì1300, when again they would hold it only for a few months. Retirement During the last years of Hethum's reign, largely as a result of Hethum's active support of the Mongols,Amitai-Preiss refers to the Armenians as \\"active allies of the Mongols\\" and speaks of \\"the subsequent retribution that Baybars exacted from them\\" (p. 106). the Kingdom came under increasing attack by the Mamluks, who invaded in 1266, taking 40,000 Armenians captive, (including Hethum's son, Leo) at the Disaster of Mari. Hethum was able to ransom his son by conceding territory to the Egyptians. In May 1268, the allied Principality of Antioch was overrun by the Egyptians. Hethum abdicated in 1270 in favor of his son Leo, and lived out the rest of his life in a monastery, as a monk. See also *Armenians in China Notes References  * Bournoutian, George A. (2002).

Battleships became the main form of capital ship after sailing vessels fell out of use, and remained so up to World War II. Shown is the German . Ships of the line (of battle) were the capital ships of the era of sail. Pictured is the Spanish Santa Ana, a very large example with 112 guns. The capital ships of a navy are its most important warships; they are generally the larger ships when compared to other warships in their respective fleet. A capital ship is generally a leading or a primary ship in a naval fleet. William S. Lind, in the book America Can Win (p. 90), defines a capital ship as follows: \\"These characteristics define a capital ship: if the capital ships are beaten, the navy is beaten. But if the rest of the navy is beaten, the capital ships can still operate. Another characteristic that defines capital ships is that their main opponent is each other.\\" There is usually no formal criterion for the classification, but it is a useful concept in naval strategy; for example, it permits comparisons between relative naval strengths in a theatre of operations without the need for considering specific details of tonnage or gun diameters. A notable example of this is the Mahanian doctrine, which was applied in the planning of the defence of Singapore in World War II, where the Royal Navy had to decide the allocation of its battleships and battlecruisers between the Atlantic and Pacific theatres. The Mahanian doctrine was also applied by the Imperial Japanese Navy, leading to its preventive move to attack Pearl Harbor and the battleships of the U.S. Pacific Fleet. The naval nature of the Pacific Theater of Operations, more commonly referred to as the Pacific War, necessitated the United States Navy mostly deploying its battleships and aircraft carriers in the Pacific. The war in Europe was primarily a land war; consequently, Germany's surface fleet was small, and the escort ships used in the Battle of the Atlantic were mostly destroyers and destroyer escorts to counter the U-boat threat. Age of Sail Before the advent of the all-steel navy in the late 19th century, a capital ship during the Age of Sail was generally understood as a ship that conformed to the Royal Navy's rating system of a ship of the line as being of the first, second, third or fourth rates: * First rate: 100 or more guns, typically carried on three or four decks. Four-deckers suffered in rough seas, and the lowest deck could seldom fire except in calm conditions. * Second rate: 90‚Äì98 guns. * Third rate: 64 to 80 guns (although 64-gun third-raters were small and not very numerous in any era). * Fourth rate: 46 to 60 guns. By 1756, these ships were acknowledged to be too weak to stand in the line of battle and were relegated to ancillary duties, although they also served in the shallow North Sea and American littorals where larger ships of the line could not sail. Frigates were ships of the fifth rate; sixth rates comprised small frigates and corvettes. Towards the end of the Napoleonic Wars and into the late 19th century, some larger and more powerful frigates were classified as fourth rates. Battleship / battlecruiser The term \\"capital ship\\" was first coined in 1909 and formally defined in the limitation treaties of the 1920s and '30s in the Washington Naval Treaty, London Naval Treaty, and Second London Naval Treaty. This applied mainly to ships resulting from the dreadnought revolution; dreadnought battleships (also known first as dreadnoughts and later as battleships) and battlecruisers. In the 20th century, especially in World Wars I and II, typical capital ships would be battleships and battlecruisers. All of the above ships were close to 20,000 tons displacement or heavier, with large caliber guns and heavy armor protection. Cruisers, despite being important ships, were not considered capital ships. An exception to the above in World War II was the . Though this class was technically similar to a heavy cruiser, albeit with considerably heavier guns, they were regarded by some as capital ships (hence the British label \\"Pocket battleship\\") since they were one of the few heavy surface units of the Kriegsmarine. The American , Dutch Design 1047 battlecruiser and the Japanese Design B-65 cruiser, planned specifically to counter the heavy cruisers being built by their naval rivals, have been described as \\"super cruisers\\", \\"large cruisers\\" or even \\"unrestricted cruisers\\", with some advocating that they even be considered as battlecruisers, however they were never classified as capital ships.Chesneau, p. 388; Garzke & Dulin, p. 86; Friedman 1984, p. 288; McLaughlin 2006, p. 104 During the Cold War, a Soviet large missile cruiser had a displacement great enough to rival World War II-era battleships and battlecruisers, perhaps defining a new capital ship for that era. In regard to technical design, however, the Kirov is simply a supersized guided-missile cruiser with nuclear propulsion. Aircraft carrier An F/A-18C Hornet launching from the flight deck of a modern aircraft carrier It took until late 1942 for aircraft carriers to be universally considered capital ships. The U.S. Navy was forcedww2pacific.com Pacific Fleet not at Pearlww2pacific.com Pacific Fleet at PearlSolarnavigator.net Pearl Harbor to rely primarily on its aircraft carriers after the attack on Pearl Harbor sank or damaged eight of its Pacific-fleet battleships. In the 21st century, the aircraft carrier is the last remaining capital ship, with capability defined in decks available and aircraft per deck, rather than in guns and calibers. The United States possesses supremacy, in both categories of aircraft carriers, possessing not only 11 active duty supercarriers each capable of carrying and launching nearly 100 tactical aircraft, but an additional 12 amphibious assault ships as capable (in the \\"Sea Control Ship\\" configuration) as the light VSTOL carriers of other nations.James F. Amos \\"Gen Amos' speech to Surface Navy Association.\\" Despite their significance to modern fleets, the U.S. Navy has never named aircraft carriers after U.S. states as was the practice when battleships (e.g. ) were considered capital ships. Instead, U.S. state names are today applied to nuclear submarines while aircraft carriers are named after famous Navy personnel and presidents, such as Chester W. Nimitz and Gerald R. Ford. Nuclear submarines Ballistic missile submarines (or \\"boomers\\"), while important ships and similar in tonnage to early battleships, are usually counted as part of a nation's nuclear deterrent force and do not share the sea control mission of traditional capital ships. Nevertheless, many navies, including the Royal Navy and the United States Navy, consider these ships to be capital ships and have given some of them names previously used for battleships, e.g. Dreadnought and Vanguard. Naming Some navies reserve specific names for their capital ships. Names reserved for capital ships include chiefs of state (e.g. ), important places, historically important naval officers or admiralty (e.g. ), historical events or objects (e.g. ), and traditional names (e.g. ). However, there are some exceptions to the rule. Beginning with (the first U.S. battleship), U.S. capital ships have traditionally been named after U.S. states. Lesser vessels are named after U.S. territories (e.g. Alaska-class cruisers just before and during World War II), major U.S. cities (e.g. cruisers), or U.S. presidents (e.g. early attack submarines and late aircraft carriers). Prior to and during World War II the Imperial Japanese Navy also followed the practice of naming battleships after provinces (e.g. ). Beginning with the first class of Trident-equipped ballistic missile submarines (i.e. the ), state names have been applied to U.S. nuclear submarines, indicating their status as capital ships. Previous ballistic missile submarines (e.g. Poseidon missile-equipped submarines) had not been named for states. After the completion of the last Ohio-class ballistic missile submarine, state names were applied to attack submarines (e.g. ). Earlier attack submarines had been named for major cities (e.g. ) ‚Äì as was previously the practice for cruisers (e.g. ). In fiction The term has been adopted into science fiction literature and culture to describe large spaceships used in military contexts, particularly where other naval terms have also been adopted in similar fashion; for example, sci-fi capital spaceships are often \\"carriers\\", that carry small fighters analogous to the way the real world naval equivalent carries fighter aircraft, as well as functioning as \\"battleships\\".

Stealth aircraft are designed to avoid detection using a variety of technologies that reduce reflection/emission of radar, infrared, visible light, radio frequency (RF) spectrum, and audio, collectively known as stealth technology. The F-117 Nighthawk was the first operational aircraft specifically designed around stealth technology. Other examples of stealth aircraft include the B-2 Spirit, the F-22 Raptor, the F-35 Lightning II, the Chengdu J-20, and the Sukhoi Su-57. While no aircraft is totally invisible to radar, stealth aircraft make it more difficult for conventional radar to detect or track the aircraft effectively, increasing the odds of an aircraft successfully avoiding detection by enemy radar and/or avoiding being successfully targeted by radar guided weapons. Stealth is the combination of passive low observable (LO) features and active emitters such as low- probability-of-intercept radars, radios and laser designators. These are usually combined with active measures such as carefully planning all mission maneuvers in order to minimize the aircraft's radar cross-section, since common actions such as hard turns or opening bomb bay doors can more than double an otherwise stealthy aircraft's radar return. It is accomplished by using a complex design philosophy to reduce the ability of an opponent's sensors to detect, track, or attack the stealth aircraft. This philosophy also takes into account the heat, sound, and other emissions of the aircraft as these can also be used to locate it. Sensors made to reduce the impact of current low observable technologies exist or have been proposed such as IRST (infrared search and track) systems to detect even reduced heat emissions, long wavelength radars to counter stealth shaping and RAM focused on shorter wavelength radar, or radar setups with multiple emitters to counter stealth shaping. However these do so with disadvantages compared to traditional radar against non-stealthy aircraft. Full-size stealth combat aircraft demonstrators have been flown by the United States (in 1977), Russia (in 2000) and China (in 2011). , the only combat-ready stealth aircraft in service are the Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit (1997), the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor (2005); the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II (2015); and the Chengdu J-20 (2017), with a number of other countries developing their own designs. There are also various aircraft with reduced detectability, either unintentionally or as a secondary feature. Background =World War I and World War II= The Linke-Hofmann R.I prototype. An experimental, German World War 1 bomber, covered with transparent covering material (1917‚Äì1918) During World War I, the Germans experimented with the use of Cellon (Cellulose acetate), a transparent covering material, in an attempt to reduce the visibility of military aircraft. Single examples of the Fokker E.III Eindecker fighter monoplane, the Albatros C.I two-seat observation biplane, and the Linke-Hofmann R.I prototype heavy bomber were covered with cellon. However, it proved ineffective, and even counterproductive, as sunlight glinting from the covering made the aircraft even more visible. The material was also found to be quickly degraded both by sunlight and in-flight temperature changes so the attempt to make transparent aircraft was not proceeded with. In 1916, the British modified a small SS class airship for the purpose of night-time aerial reconnaissance over German Empire lines on the Western Front. Fitted with a silenced engine and a black gas bag, the craft was both invisible and inaudible from the ground, but several night-time flights over German-held territory produced little useful intelligence, and the idea was dropped. Nearly three decades later, a more serious attempt at radar \\"invisibility\\" was tried with the Horten Ho 229 flying wing fighter-bomber, developed in Nazi Germany during the last years of World War II. In addition to the aircraft's shape, the majority of the Ho 229's wooden skin was bonded together using carbon-impregnated plywood resins designed with the purported intention of absorbing radar waves. Testing performed in early 2009 by the Northrop-Grumman Corporation established that this compound, along with the aircraft's shape, would have rendered the Ho 229 virtually invisible to the top-end HF-band, 20‚Äì30 MHz primary signals of Britain's Chain Home early warning radar, provided the aircraft was traveling at high speed (approximately ) at extremely low altitude ‚Äì . > =Modern era= Modern stealth aircraft first became possible when Denys Overholser, a mathematician working for Lockheed Aircraft during the 1970s, adopted a mathematical model developed by Petr Ufimtsev, a Soviet scientist, to develop a computer program called Echo 1. Echo made it possible to predict the radar signature of an aircraft made with flat panels, called facets. In 1975, engineers at Lockheed Skunk Works found that an aircraft made with faceted surfaces could have a very low radar signature because the surfaces would radiate almost all of the radar energy away from the receiver. Lockheed built a model called \\"the Hopeless Diamond\\", a reference to the famous Hope Diamond and the design's predicted instability. Because advanced computers were available to control the flight of even the Hopeless Diamond, for the first time designers realized that it might be possible to make an aircraft that was virtually invisible to radar. Reduced radar cross section is only one of five factors the designers addressed to create a truly stealthy design such as the F-22. The F-22 has also been designed to disguise its infrared emissions to make it harder to detect by infrared homing (\\"heat seeking\\") surface-to-air or air-to-air missiles. Designers also addressed making the aircraft less visible to the naked eye, controlling radio transmissions, and noise abatement. The first combat use of purpose-designed stealth aircraft was in December 1989 during Operation Just Cause in Panama. On 20 December 1989, two United States Air Force F-117s bombed a Panamanian Defense Force barracks in Rio Hato, Panama. In 1991, F-117s were tasked with attacking the most heavily fortified targets in Iraq in the opening phase of Operation Desert Storm and were the only jets allowed to operate inside Baghdad's city limits. General design The general design of a stealth aircraft is always aimed at reducing radar and thermal detection. It is the designer's top priority to satisfy the following conditions, which ultimately decide the success of the aircraft:- *Reducing thermal emission from thrust *Reducing radar detection by altering some general configuration (like introducing the split rudder) *Reducing radar detection when the aircraft opens its weapons bay *Reducing infra-red and radar detection during adverse weather conditions Limitations B-2 Spirit stealth bomber of the U.S. Air Force =Instability of design= Early stealth aircraft were designed with a focus on minimal radar cross section (RCS) rather than aerodynamic performance. Highly stealth aircraft like the F-117 Nighthawk are aerodynamically unstable in all three axes and require constant flight corrections from a fly-by-wire (FBW) flight system to maintain controlled flight. As for the B-2 Spirit, which was based on the development of the flying wing aircraft by Jack Northrop in 1940, this design allowed for a stable aircraft with sufficient yaw control, even without vertical surfaces such as rudders. =Aerodynamic limitations= Earlier stealth aircraft (such as the F-117 and B-2) lack afterburners, because the hot exhaust would increase their infrared footprint, and flying faster than the speed of sound would produce an obvious sonic boom, as well as surface heating of the aircraft skin, which also increases the infrared footprint. As a result, their performance in air combat maneuvering required in a dogfight would never match that of a dedicated fighter aircraft. This was unimportant in the case of these two aircraft since both were designed to be bombers. More recent design techniques allow for stealthy designs such as the F-22 without compromising aerodynamic performance. Newer stealth aircraft, like the F-22, F-35 and the Su-57, have performance characteristics that meet or exceed those of current front-line jet fighters due to advances in other technologies such as flight control systems, engines, airframe construction and materials. =Electromagnetic emissions= The high level of computerization and large amount of electronic equipment found inside stealth aircraft are often claimed to make them vulnerable to passive detection. This is highly unlikely and certainly systems such as Tamara and Kolchuga, which are often described as counter-stealth radars, are not designed to detect stray electromagnetic fields of this type. Such systems are designed to detect intentional, higher power emissions such as radar and communication signals. Stealth aircraft are deliberately operated to avoid or reduce such emissions. Current Radar Warning Receivers look for the regular pings of energy from mechanically swept radars while fifth generation jet fighters use Low Probability of Intercept Radars with no regular repeat pattern. =Vulnerable modes of flight= Stealth aircraft are still vulnerable to detection during, and immediately after using their weaponry. Since stealth payload (reduced RCS bombs and cruise missiles) is not yet generally available, and ordnance mount points create a significant radar return, stealth aircraft carry all armaments internally. As soon as weapons bay doors are opened, the plane's RCS will be multiplied and even older generation radar systems will be able to locate the stealth aircraft. While the aircraft will reacquire its stealth as soon as the bay doors are closed, a fast response defensive weapons system has a short opportunity to engage the aircraft. This vulnerability is addressed by operating in a manner that reduces the risk and consequences of temporary acquisition. The B-2's operational altitude imposes a flight time for defensive weapons that makes it virtually impossible to engage the aircraft during its weapons deployment. New stealth aircraft designs such as the F-22 and F-35 can open their bays, release munitions and return to stealthy flight in less than a second. Some weapons require that the weapon's guidance system acquire the target while the weapon is still attached to the aircraft. This forces relatively extended operations with the bay doors open. Also, such aircraft as the F-22 Raptor and F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter can also carry additional weapons and fuel on hardpoints below their wings. When operating in this mode the planes will not be nearly as stealthy, as the hardpoints and the weapons mounted on those hardpoints will show up on radar systems. This option therefore represents a trade off between stealth or range and payload. External stores allow those aircraft to attack more targets further away, but will not allow for stealth during that mission as compared to a shorter range mission flying on just internal fuel and using only the more limited space of the internal weapon bays for armaments. =Reduced payload= In a 1994 live fire exercise near Point Mugu, California, a U.S. Air Force B-2 Spirit dropped forty-seven class Mark 82 bombs, which represents about half of a B-2's total ordnance payload in Block 30 configuration Fully stealth aircraft carry all fuel and armament internally, which limits the payload. By way of comparison, the F-117 carries only two laser- or GPS-guided bombs, while a non-stealth attack aircraft can carry several times more. This requires the deployment of additional aircraft to engage targets that would normally require a single non-stealth attack aircraft. This apparent disadvantage however is offset by the reduction in fewer supporting aircraft that are required to provide air cover, air-defense suppression and electronic counter measures, making stealth aircraft \\"force multipliers\\". =Sensitive skin= Stealth aircraft often have skins made with Radar-absorbent materials or RAMs. Some of these contain Carbon black particles, some contain tiny iron spheres. There are many materials used in RAMs, and some are classified, particularly the materials that specific aircraft use. =Cost of operations= Stealth aircraft are typically more expensive to develop and manufacture. An example is the B-2 Spirit that is many times more expensive to manufacture and support than conventional bomber aircraft. The B-2 program cost the U.S. Air Force almost $105 billion. Countermeasures =Reflected waves= Passive (multistatic) radar, bistatic radar and especially multistatic radar systems detect some stealth aircraft better than conventional monostatic radars, since first- generation stealth technology (such as the F117) reflects energy away from the transmitter's line of sight, effectively increasing the radar cross section (RCS) in other directions, which the passive radars monitor. Such a system typically uses either low frequency broadcast TV and FM radio signals (at which frequencies controlling the aircraft's signature is more difficult). Researchers at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign with support of DARPA, have shown that it is possible to build a synthetic aperture radar image of an aircraft target using passive multistatic radar, possibly detailed enough to enable automatic target recognition.ATR. DARPA In December 2007, SAAB researchers revealed details for a system called Associative Aperture Synthesis Radar (AASR) that would employ a large array of inexpensive and redundant transmitters and receivers that could detect targets when they directly pass between the receivers/transmitters and create a shadow. The system was originally designed to detect stealthy cruise missiles and should be just as effective against low-flying stealth aircraft. That the array could contain a large amount of inexpensive equipment could potentially offer some \\"protection\\" against attacks by expensive anti-radar (or anti-radiation) missiles. =Infrared (heat)= Some analysts claim Infra-red search and track systems (IRSTs) can be deployed against stealth aircraft, because any aircraft surface heats up due to air friction and with a two channel IRST is a CO2 (4.3 ¬µm absorption maxima) detection possible, through difference comparing between the low and high channel. These analysts point to the resurgence in such systems in Russian designs in the 1980s, such as those fitted to the MiG-29 and Su-27. The latest version of the MiG-29, the MiG-35, is equipped with a new Optical Locator System that includes more advanced IRST capabilities. The French Rafale, the British/German/Italian/Spanish Eurofighter and the Swedish Gripen also make extensive use of IRST. In air combat, the optronic suite allows: * Detection of non-afterburning targets at range and more; * Identification of those targets at range; and * Estimates of aerial target range at up to . For ground targets, the suite allows: * A tank-effective detection range up to , and aircraft carrier detection at ; * Identification of the tank type on the range, and of an aircraft carrier at ; and * Estimates of ground target range of up to . =Longer wavelength radar= VHF radar systems have wavelengths comparable to aircraft feature sizes and should exhibit scattering in the resonance region rather than the optical region, allowing most stealth aircraft to be detected. This has prompted Nizhny Novgorod Research Institute of Radio Engineering (NNIIRT) to develop VHF AESAs such as the NEBO SVU, which is capable of performing target acquisition for Surface-to-air missile batteries. Despite the advantages offered by VHF radar, their longer wavelengths result in poor resolution compared to comparably sized X band radar array. As a result, these systems must be very large before they can have the resolution for an engagement radar. An example of a ground- based VHF radar with counter-stealth capability is the P-18 radar. The Dutch company Thales Nederland, formerly known as Holland Signaal, developed a naval phased-array radar called SMART-L, which is operated at L Band and has counter-stealth. All ships of the Royal Dutch Navy's De Zeven Provinci√´n class carry, among others, the SMART-L radar. =OTH radar (over-the-horizon radar)= Over-the-horizon radar is a concept increasing radar's effective range over conventional radar. The Australian JORN Jindalee Operational Radar Network can overcome certain stealth characteristics. It is claimed that the HF frequency used and the method of bouncing radar from ionosphere overcomes the stealth characteristics of the F-117A. In other words, stealth aircraft are optimized for defeating much higher-frequency radar from front-on rather than low-frequency radars from above. Operational usage of stealth aircraft The U.S. and Israel are the only countries to have used stealth aircraft in combat. These deployments include the United States invasion of Panama, the first Gulf War, the Kosovo Conflict, the War in Afghanistan, the War in Iraq and the 2011 military intervention in Libya. The first use of stealth aircraft was in the U.S. invasion of Panama, where F-117 Nighthawk stealth attack aircraft were used to drop bombs on enemy airfields and positions while evading enemy radar. In 1990 the F-117 Nighthawk was used in the First Gulf War, where F-117s flew 1,300 sorties and scored direct hits on 1,600 high-value targets in Iraq while accumulating 6,905 flight hours. Only 2.5% of the American aircraft in Iraq were F-117s, yet they struck 40% of the strategic targets, dropping 2,000 tons of precision-guided munitions and striking their targets with an 80% success rate. In the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia two stealth aircraft were used by the United States, the veteran F-117 Nighthawk, and the newly introduced B-2 Spirit strategic stealth bomber. The F-117 performed its usual role of striking precision high-value targets and performed well, although one F-117 was shot down by a Serbian Isayev S-125 'Neva-M' missile commanded by Colonel Zolt√°n Dani. The then-new B-2 Spirit was highly successful, destroying 33% of selected Serbian bombing targets in the first eight weeks of U.S. involvement in the War. During this war, B-2s flew non-stop to Kosovo from their home base in Missouri and back. In the 2003 invasion of Iraq, F-117 Nighthawks and B-2 Spirits were used, and this was the last time the F-117 would see combat. F-117s dropped satellite-guided strike munitions on selected targets, with high success. B-2 Spirits conducted 49 sorties in the invasion, releasing 1.5 million pounds of munitions. During the May 2011 operation to kill Osama bin Laden, one of the helicopters used to clandestinely insert U.S. troops into Pakistan crashed in the bin Laden compound. From the wreckage it was revealed this helicopter had stealth characteristics, making this the first publicly known operational use of a stealth helicopter. Stealth aircraft were used in the 2011 military intervention in Libya, where B-2 Spirits dropped 40 bombs on a Libyan airfield with concentrated air defenses in support of the UN no-fly zone. Stealth aircraft will continue to play a valuable role in air combat with the United States using the F-22 Raptor, B-2 Spirit, and the F-35 Lightning II to perform a variety of operations. The F-22 made its combat debut over Syria in September 2014 as part of the US-led coalition to defeat ISIS. From February 2018, Su-57s performed the first international flight as they were spotted landing at the Russian Khmeimim air base in Syria. These Su-57s were deployed along with four Sukhoi Su-35 fighters, four Sukhoi Su-25s, and one Beriev A-50 AEW&C; aircraft.\\"Alleged PHOTO, VIDEO of Russian Su-57 Fifth Gen Jet in Syria Released on Twitter\\". Sputnik (news agency). 22 February 2018. It is believed that at least 4 Su-57 are deployed in Syria.https://thediplomat.com/2020/02/report-russia-has-developed-prototype- of-air-to-ground-hypersonic-missile-for-su-57/ and that they have likely been armed with cruise missiles in combat \\"Alert 5 ¬ª Su-57 launched cruise missile while deployed to Syria\\". Military Aviation News. alert5.com. In 2018, a report surfaced noting that Israeli F-35I stealth fighters conducted a number of missions in Syria and even infiltrated Iranian airspace without detection. In May 2018, Major General Amikam Norkin of IAF reported that Israeli Air Force F-35I stealth fighters carried out the first-ever F-35 strike in combat over Syria. The People's Republic of China started flight testing its Chengdu J-20 stealth multirole fighter around in 2011 and made its first public appearance at Airshow China 2016. The aircraft entered service with the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) in March 2017. Another fifth- generation stealth multirole fighter from China, the Shenyang FC-31 is also under flight testing.

She was the third Navy ship named after the city of Atlanta, Georgia. Designed to provide anti-aircraft protection for US naval task groups, Atlanta served in this capacity in the naval battles Midway and the Eastern Solomons. Atlanta was heavily damaged by Japanese and friendly gunfire in a night surface action on 13 November 1942 during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. The cruiser was sunk on her captain's orders in the afternoon of the same day. Atlanta, in some works, is designated CLAA-51 because of her primary armament as an anti-aircraft cruiser. Hence, all of the Atlanta-class ships are sometimes designated as CLAA. However, her entire battery of guns were dual-purpose (DP) guns, and were capable of being used against both air and surface targets, able to fire anti-aircraft, high-explosive and armor- piercing shells. The Atlanta-class ships were lightly armored, making them poor surface combatants compared to a typical light cruiser. In terms of armament, the Atlanta class was closer to a destroyer, being armed with 5-inch guns, than a light cruiser, which were generally equipped with 6-inch guns; but at well over in length, and combined with their large battery of sixteen guns (reduced to twelve in number for later ships of the class), they were designated as light cruisers. Typical destroyers of the time only carried five or six 5-inch guns. Despite being under-armored for light cruisers, they had thicker armor than destroyers, which were notoriously underprotected. Construction and commissioning The first of the new class of ships was laid down on 22 April 1940 at Kearny, New Jersey, by the Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Co., launched on 6 September 1941, sponsored by Margaret Mitchell (author of Gone with the Wind), and commissioned at the New York Navy Yard on 24 December 1941, Captain Samuel P. Jenkins in command. =Armament= Atlanta was fitted with eight twin 5-inch gun mounts, placed in a unique configuration. She had three forward mounts and three aft mounts, mounted inline and increasing in height toward the midships, giving her a symmetrical appearance, with a \\"gap\\" in the middle superstructure. In addition, the aft battery also had one \\"wing-mounted\\" mount on each side, for a total of 16 five-inch guns. The firing arcs of the forward and aft batteries intersected at a very limited angle, giving her an arc of 60¬∞ in which she could fire all of her guns broadside (excluding the wing mounts). Because Atlanta was able to bring all her guns to bear only within that narrow arc, her ability to engage surface targets was limited. Her firing arcs were ideally suited to bringing her guns to bear on an aircraft, however, with a minimum of six guns available from any angle. Service history After fitting out, Atlanta conducted shakedown training until 13 March 1942, first in Chesapeake Bay and then in Maine's Casco Bay, after which she returned to the New York Navy Yard for post-shakedown repairs and alterations. Adjudged to be \\"ready for distant service\\" on 31 March, the new cruiser departed New York for the Panama Canal Zone on 5 April. She reached Cristobal on 8 April. After transiting the isthmian waterway, Atlanta then cleared Balboa on 12 April with orders to reconnoiter Clipperton Island, a tiny barren, uninhabited atoll about 670 mi (1,080 km) southwest of Acapulco, Mexico, in the course of her voyage to the Hawaiian Islands, for any signs of enemy activity. Finding none, she ultimately reached Pearl Harbor on 23 April. =Battle of Midway= Atlanta with and on 6 June 1942. Punctuating her brief stay in Hawaiian waters with an antiaircraft practice off Oahu on 3 May, Atlanta, in company with , sailed on 10 May as escort for and , bound for Noum√©a, New Caledonia. On 16 May, she joined Vice Admiral William F. Halsey's Task Force 16 (TF 16), formed around the aircraft carriers and , as it steamed back to Pearl Harbor, having been summoned back to Hawaiian waters in response to an imminent Japanese thrust in the direction of Midway Atoll. TF 16 arrived at Pearl on 26 May. Atlanta again sailed with TF 16 on the morning of 28 May. Over the days that followed, she screened the carriers as they operated northeast of Midway in anticipation of the enemy's arrival. At the report of Japanese ships to the southwest, on the morning of 4 June, Atlanta cleared for action as she screened Hornet. Squadrons from the American carriers sought out the Japanese, and during that day, planes from and Enterprise inflicted mortal damage on four irreplaceable enemy aircraft carriers. Japanese planes twice hit TF 17, and it took the brunt of the enemy attacks. Over the days that followed the Battle of Midway, Atlanta remained in the screen of TF 16 until 11 June, when the task force received orders to return to Pearl Harbor. Reaching her destination on 13 June, Atlanta, outside brief periods of antiaircraft practice on 21 and 25‚Äì26 June, remained in port, taking on stores and provisions and standing on 24-hour and then 48-hour alert into July 1942. Drydocked on 1‚Äì2 July so that her bottom could be scraped, cleaned and painted, the cruiser completed her availability on 6 July and then resumed a busy schedule of gunnery practice with drone targets, high-speed sleds, and in shore bombardment in the Hawaiian operating area. On 15 July 1942, Atlanta, again in TF 16, sailed for Tongatapu. Anchoring at Nuku ªalofa, Tonga on 24 July, where she fueled and then took on fuel from Mobilube, the light cruiser pushed on later the same day and overtook TF 16. On 29 July, as all preparations proceeded for the invasion of Guadalcanal, Atlanta was assigned to TF 61. Screening the carriers as they launched air strikes to support the initial landings on 7‚Äì8 August, Atlanta remained there until the withdrawal of the carrier task forces on 9 August. For the next several days, she remained at sea, replenishing when necessary while the task force operated near the Solomons. =Battle of the Eastern Solomons= As the Americans consolidated their gains on Guadalcanal, the critical need for reinforcements prompted Japanese Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto to send the Combined Fleet south to cover a large troop convoy. American scout planes spotted the Japanese forces on the morning of 23 August. With the enemy reported to the northwest, Enterprise and launched search and attack planes, but they failed to make contact because of deteriorating weather and the fact that the Japanese, knowing that they had been spotted, reversed course. Throughout the day on 24 August, Atlanta received enemy contact reports and screened Enterprise as she launched a strike group to attack the Japanese carriers. The sighting of an enemy \\"snooper\\" at 1328 sent Atlantas sailors to general quarters, where they remained for the next 5¬Ω hours. At 1530, the cruiser worked up to as TF 16 stood roughly north- northwestward \\"to close [the] reported enemy carrier group.\\" At 1637, with unidentified planes approaching, Atlanta went to . Enterprise then launched a strike group shortly thereafter, completing the evolution at 1706. In the meantime, the incoming enemy bombers and fighter aircraft from and prompted the task force to increase speed to , shortly after Enterprise completed launching her own aircraft, the Japanese raid, estimated by Captain Jenkins to consist of at least 18 Aichi D3A1 \\"Val\\" dive bombers, came in from the north northwest at 1710. Over the next 11 minutes, Atlantas , and 20 mm batteries contributed to the barrage over Enterprise, as the light cruiser conformed to Enterprises every move as she maneuvered violently to avoid the dive bombers. Despite the heavy antiaircraft fire, Enterprise took one hit and suffered some shrapnel damage from an estimated five near hits. Captain Jenkins later reported that his ship may have shot down five of the attackers. Atlanta was not damaged in the engagement. Reporting to TF 11 for duty the following day, Atlanta operated with that force, redesignated TF 61 on 30 August, over the next few days. When torpedoed Saratoga on 31 August, the light cruiser screened the stricken flagship as rigged a towline and began taking her out of danger. The force ultimately put into Tongatapu on 6 September, where Atlanta provisioned ship, fueled from , and enjoyed a period of upkeep. Underway on 13 September, the light cruiser escorted and on 15 September. After seeing her charges safely to their destination at Dumbea Bay, Noum√©a, on 19 September, Atlanta fueled, took on stores and ammunition, and sailed on 21 September as part of Task Group 66.4 (TG 66.4). Becoming part of TF 17 on 23 September, the light cruiser was detached the following day to proceed in company with , and to Tongatapu, which she reached on 26 September. Underway with those same ships on 7 October, Atlanta briefly escorted Guadalcanal-bound transports from 11 to 14 October, before putting into Espiritu Santo for fuel on the afternoon of the 15th. Assigned then to Rear Admiral Willis A. Lee's TF 64, the ship sailed after dark that same day to resume operations covering the ongoing efforts to secure Guadalcanal. Returning briefly to Espiritu Santo for fuel, stores and provisions, the warship stood out from Segond Channel on the afternoon of 23 October. Two days later, with a Japanese Army offensive having failed to eject the Americans from Guadalcanal, Admiral Yamamoto sent the Combined Fleet south in an attempt to annihilate the American naval forces doggedly supporting the marines. Atlanta operated in TF 64, along with Washington, , and two destroyers, as the opposing forces engaged in the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands on 26 October. That day, Atlanta patrolled astern of the fueling group supporting the two American carrier task forces. On 27 October, when attacked TF 64, the force maneuvered at high speed to clear the area. On the morning of 28 October, Atlanta brought on board Rear Admiral Norman Scott from San Francisco, and became the flagship of the newly designated TG 64.2. After fueling from Washington, Atlanta, screened by four destroyers, headed northwest to shell Japanese positions on Guadalcanal. Reaching the waters off Lunga Point on the morning of 30 October, Atlanta embarked Marine liaison officers at 0550, and then steamed west, commencing her bombardment of Point Cruz at 0629 while the destroyers formed a column astern. Provoking no return fire, TG 64.2 accomplished its mission and returned to Lunga Point, where Atlanta disembarked the liaison officers. She then proceeded, in company with her screen, to Espiritu Santo, where she arrived on the afternoon of 31 October. =Naval Battle of Guadalcanal= Convoy escort Atlanta on 25 October 1942. Atlanta served as Admiral Scott's flagship as the light cruiser, accompanied by four destroyers, escorted , and to Guadalcanal. The cruiser and her consorts continued to screen those ships, designated TG 62.4, as they lay off Lunga Point on 12 November unloading supplies and disembarking troops. At 0905, the task group received a report that nine bombers and 12 fighters were approaching from the northwest, and would reach their vicinity at about 0930. At about 0920, Atlanta led the three auxiliaries to the north in column, with the destroyers spaced in a circle around them. 15 minutes later, nine \\"Vals\\" from emerged from the clouds over Henderson Field, the American airstrip on Guadalcanal. The American ships opened fire soon after, putting up a barrage that downed \\"several\\" planes. Fortunately, none of the primary targets of the attack, Zeilin, Libra and Betelgeuse, suffered more than minor damage from several close calls, though Zeilin sustained some flooding. The three auxiliaries returned to the waters off Lunga Point as soon as the attack ended and resumed working cargo and disembarking troops. A little over an hour later, at 1050, Atlanta received word of another incoming Japanese air raid. 15 minutes later, Atlanta led the three auxiliaries north with the destroyers in a circle around the disposition. The \\"bogeys\\", 27 Mitsubishi G4M \\"Bettys\\" from Rabaul, closed, sighted bearing west by north, approaching from over Cape Esperance in a very loose \\"V\\" formation. Although the destroyers opened fire, the planes proved to be out of range and the ships checked fire. The \\"Bettys\\", for their part, ignored the ships and continued on to bomb Henderson Field. Upon the disappearance of the planes, TG 62.4 resumed unloading off Lunga Point. On 12 November, Atlanta was still off Lunga Point, screening the unloading, as part of TF 67 under Rear Admiral Daniel J. Callaghan in San Francisco. At about 1310, Atlanta received a warning that 25 enemy planes were headed for Guadalcanal, slated to arrive within 50 minutes. The light cruiser went to general quarters at 1318 and received the signal \\"prepare to repel air attack....\\" Within six minutes, Atlanta and the other combatants of the support group formed a screen around the transport group (TG 67.1), and the two groups steamed north together at . At about 1410, the Americans sighted the incoming raid, consisting of what appeared to be 25 twin-engined bombers (\\"Bettys\\") which broke up into two groups after clearing Florida Island, and came in at altitudes that ranged from . opened fire at 1412. Atlanta did so a minute later, training her guns at planes headed for the gap in the screen between San Francisco and . Atlanta claimed to have shot down two \\"Bettys\\", just after they dropped their torpedoes, at about 1415, only three minutes before the attack ended. Once the last Japanese plane had been splashed, the work of unloading the transports and cargo ships resumed. One \\"Betty\\", crippled by antiaircraft fire, crashed into the after superstructure of San Francisco, inflicting the only damage on the force. Night attack The abrupt end of the air attack gave Atlanta and her colleagues only a brief respite, however, for trouble approached from yet another quarter. A Japanese surface force, made up of two battleships, one cruiser and six destroyers, was detected steaming south toward Guadalcanal to shell Henderson Field. Admiral Callaghan's support group was to \\"cover [the retiring transports and cargo vessels] against enemy attack.\\" TG 67.4 departed Lunga Point about 1800 and steamed eastward through Sealark Channel, covering the withdrawal of TG 67.1. An hour before midnight, Callaghan's ships reversed course and headed westward. Helenas radar picked up the first contact at a range of . As the range closed, Atlantas surface search radar, followed by her gunnery radars, picked up a contact on the enemy ships. Admiral Callaghan's order for a course change caused problems almost at once, as Atlanta had to turn to port (left) immediately to avoid a collision with one of the four destroyers in the van, the latter having apparently executed a \\"ships left\\" rather than \\"column left\\" movement. As Atlanta began moving to resume her station ahead of San Francisco, the illuminated the light cruiser. Atlanta shifted her main battery to fire at the enemy destroyer, opening fire at a range of about and, along with other US ships that concentrated on Akatsukis searchlights, overwhelmed the destroyer.The Lost Ships of Guadalcanal by Robert Ballard and The Naval Battle of Guadalcanal: Night Action 13 November 1942 by James Grace As two other Japanese destroyers crossed her line, Atlanta engaged both with her forward mounts, while her after mounts continued to blast away at the illuminated ship. An additional, unidentified assailant also opened up on the light cruiser from the northeast. At about that time, at least one torpedo plowed into Atlantas forward engine room from the port side, fired almost certainly by either or Entry for 12‚Äì13 November: First Naval Battle of Guadalcanal on both http://www.combinedfleet.com/ikazuc_t.htm AND http://www.combinedfleet.com/inazum_t.htm (Akatsukis destroyer consorts). Atlanta lost all but auxiliary diesel power, suffered the interruption of her gunfire, and had to shift steering control to the steering engine room aft. Meanwhile, Akatsuki drifted out of the action and soon sank with heavy loss of life. Michiharu Shinya, Akatsukis Chief Torpedo Officer, one of her few survivors, was rescued the next day by US forces and spent the rest of the war in a New Zealand prisoner of war camp.The Path From Guadalcanal by Michiharu Shinya and The Lost Ships of Guadalcanal by Robert Ballard He later stated unequivocally that Akatsuki had not been able to fire any torpedoes that night before being overwhelmed by gunfire.Editors Note 1 http://www.combinedfleet.com/akatsu_t.htm Soon after being torpedoed, Atlanta was then hit by an estimated nineteen 8-inch (203 mm) shells when San Francisco, \\"in the urgency of battle, darkness, and confused intermingling of friend or foe\\", fired into her. Though almost all of the shells passed through the thin skin of the ship without detonating, scattering green dye, fragments from their impact killed many men, including Admiral Scott and members of his staff. Atlanta prepared to return fire on her new assailant, but San Francisco's own gun flashes disclosed a distinctly \\"non-Japanese hull profile\\" that resulted in a suspension of those efforts. San Francisco's shells, which passed high through Atlanta's superstructure, may have been intended for a Japanese target further beyond her from San Francisco's perspective.Morrison Vol 5 XII.4.b note 22 After the fire ceased, Atlantas Captain Jenkins took stock of the situation, and, having only a minor foot wound, made his way aft to Battle II. His ship was badly battered, largely powerless, down by the head and listing slightly to port, and a third of his crew was dead or missing. As the battle continued, the light cruiser's men began clearing debris, jettisoning topside weight to correct the list, reducing the volume of sea water in the ship, and succoring the many wounded. Sinking Daylight revealed the presence nearby of three burning American destroyers, the disabled Portland, and the abandoned hulk of , which Portland summarily dispatched with three salvoes. Atlanta, drifting toward the enemy-held shore east of Cape Esperance, dropped her starboard anchor, and her captain sent a message to Portland explaining the light cruiser's condition. Boats from Guadalcanal came out to take her most critically wounded. By mid-morning, all of those had been taken off the ship. arrived at 09:30 on 13 November, took Atlanta under tow, made harder by the cruiser's still lowered anchor, and headed toward Lunga Point. During the voyage, a \\"Betty\\" bomber neared the disposition, and one of the two surviving mounts‚Äîwhich was powered by a diesel generator‚Äîfired and drove it off. The other manually-rotated mount could not be trained on the target in time. Atlanta reached Kukum about 14:00, at which point Captain Jenkins conferred with his remaining officers. As Jenkins, who was later awarded a Navy Cross for his heroism during the battle, later wrote, \\"It was by now apparent that efforts to save the ship were useless, and that the water was gaining steadily.\\" Even had sufficient salvage facilities been available, he allowed, the severe damage she had taken would have made it difficult to save the ship. Authorized by Commander, South Pacific Forces, to act at his own discretion regarding the destruction of the ship, Jenkins ordered that Atlanta be abandoned and sunk with a demolition charge. Accordingly, all remaining men except the captain and a demolition party boarded Higgins boats sent out from Guadalcanal for the purpose. After the charge had been set and exploded, the last men left the battered ship. Ultimately, at 20:15 on 13 November 1942, Atlanta sank 3 mi (5 km) west of Lunga Point in about 400 ft (120 m) of water. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 13 January 1943. Exploration of the wreck The wreck of USS Atlanta was discovered in 1992 by an expedition led by Dr. Robert Ballard using a remotely operated underwater vehicle, (ROV). Dr. Ballard was famous for leading the expeditions that discovered and the . Unfortunately, strong ocean currents and poor visibility prevented the expedition from thoroughly exploring Atlanta. In 1994, two Australian technical divers Rob Cason and Kevin Denlay travelled to Solomon Islands with the intention of being the first scuba divers to dive Atlanta but this was unsuccessful because of the lack of a suitable surface support vessel and strong surface currents; this was also the first mixed gas scuba diving expedition to Guadalcanal. However, they did manage to dive one of the two other, deepest diveable wrecks; the Japanese transport Azumasan Maru, which is almost deep at the stern and Sasako Maru, which Denlay dived in 1995 at over in the collapsed debris field of the bridge. Many other World War II wrecks discovered by Dr. Ballard in Iron Bottom Sound are beyond the current technical limit for scuba and are only accessible by ROVs or submersibles. Dr Ballard gives an account of this in his book The Lost Ships of Guadalcanal. In the same year, Denlay returned with American Terrance Tysall and made the first successful scuba dive on USS Atlanta, which was at the time the deepest wreck dive by free swimming divers in the southern hemisphere. In the following years, Denlay and Tysall mounted several larger expeditions to survey Atlanta, exploring and videoing the wreck in detail to a depth of at the bow.http://www.advanceddivermagazine.com/ezinefreearticles/Guadalcanal.pdf The civil unrest in Solomon Islands from late 1998 prevented further diving around Guadalcanal for several years. However, on the final expedition that year, the then deepest wreck dive by a woman was made by Kevin's wife, Mirja, on Atlanta. Denlay's last visit to the wreck was in 2002 using a closed circuit rebreather or CCR, the first CCR dive on Atlanta.http://www.divenewzealand.com/index.asp?s1=dive-articles&id;=106 Since then, very few dives have been conducted on Atlanta, although in May 2011 a very experienced deep diving team from Global Underwater Explorers successfully videoed the wreck for documentary purposes, the first survey of the wreck since Denlay's expeditions up to 1998. Awards Atlanta was awarded five battle stars for her World War II service and a Presidential Unit Citation for her \\"heroic example of invincible fighting spirit\\" in the battle off Guadalcanal on 13 November 1942.

He was the son of King Hetoum I and Queen Isabella and was a member of the Hetoumid family. Early life disaster of Mari, 1266: illumination from Le Livre des Merveilles, 15th century Leo was born in 1236, the son of King Hetoum I and Queen Isabella. Hetoum and Isabella's marriage in 1226 had been a forced one by Hetoum's father Constantine of Baberon, who had arranged for Queen Isabella's first husband to be murdered so as to put Constantine's own son Hetoum in place as a co-ruler with Isabella. They had six children, of which Leo was the eldest. One of his sisters was Sibylla of Armenia, who was married to Bohemond VI of Antioch to bring peace between Armenia and Antioch. In 1262, Leo married Keran (Kir Anna), the daughter of Prince Hetoum of Lampron. In 1266, while their father king Hetoum I was away to visit the Mongol court, Leo and his younger brother Thoros fought to repel Mamluk invaders, at the Battle of Mari. Thoros was killed in combat, and Leo, along with 40,000 other Armenian soldiers was captured and imprisoned. When King Hetoum returned, he paid a large ransom to retrieve his son, including a large quantity of money, handing over several fortresses, and accepting to intercede with the Mongol ruler Abagha in order to have one of Baibars's relatives freed. Reign Ayas when Marco Polo visited it in 1271, in \\"Le Livre des Merveilles\\". Hetoum I abdicated in 1269 in favour of his son, and entered the Franciscan order. He died a year later. The new king Leo II was known as a pious king, devoted to Christianity. He pursued active commercial relations with the West, by renewing trade agreements with the Italians and establishing new ones with the Catalans. He also endeavoured to reinforce the Mongol alliance,Mutafian, p.60 as his father Hetoum I had submitted Armenia to Mongol authority in 1247. In 1271, Marco Polo visited the Armenian harbour of Ayas and commented favourably about Leo's reign and the abundance of the country, although he mentions his military forces were rather demoralized: The Mongols and the Armenians were defeated by the Mamluks at the Second Battle of Homs in 1281. In 1275 the Mamluk sultan Baibars invaded Cilicia for a second time. The following year, Armenia fought off an invasion by the Turkomans, but the Constable Sempad, Leo's uncle, was killed in combat. =Mongol alliance= In 1281, Leo joined the Mongols in their invasion of Syria, but they were vanquished at the Second Battle of Homs. Leo had to sue for peace, and in 1285 obtained a 10-year truce in exchange for important territorial concessions in favour of the Mamluks.Mutafian, p.61 Leo died in 1289 from arsenic, and was succeeded by his son Hetoum II.

Five of his children reached the throne. The eldest, Hetoum II of Armenia, abdicated after four years in favor of his younger brother Thoros III of Armenia, but was placed back on the throne in 1294. In 1296, their brother Sempad of Armenia blinded Hetoum and in 1298 he strangled Thoros, in order to seize power. Sempad was then overthrown in 1298 by their younger brother Constantine III of Armenia, who was replaced by older brother Hetoum, who then abdicated in 1305 in favor of Thoros's son Leo III of Armenia. # Son (b. 15 January 1262/14 January 1263 ‚Äì d. young). # Constantine (b.

In 1907, Gaston B. Cashwell, called the Apostle of Pentecost in the South, founded a periodical called The Bridegroom's Messenger, in Atlanta, Georgia. About the same time, Paul and Hattie Barth started a church. The Barths became editors of The Bridegroom's Messenger. In 1918, they began Beulah Heights Bible School in Atlanta, and in 1921 they organized an association that became the International Pentecostal Assemblies. John Stroup, a member of the Methodist Protestant Church, professed receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost in 1908. Stroup was one of the first individuals to take the Pentecostal message into southern Ohio and parts of Kentucky. He organized the Pentecostal Church of Christ in Flatwoods, Kentucky in 1917. The body originally headquartered in Ashland, Kentucky, and later in London, Ohio. In 1976, the International Pentecostal Assemblies and the Pentecostal Church of Christ merged to become the International Pentecostal Church of Christ. Headquarters are located in London, Ohio. The church operates two youth camps, and six departments - Education, Global Missions, Home Missions and Evangelism, Christian Education, National Youth, and Women's Ministries. Publications of the church are The Bridegroom's Messenger (considered the oldest Pentecostal periodical in the world) and The Pentecostal Leader, a training magazine. Doctrines are detailed in a 19-article Statement of Faith ranging from the inspiration of the Scriptures to tithes and offerings. The IPCC is one of the only Pentecostal and Evangelical denominations to elevate the issue of racism to their statement of faith. The church holds two ordinances - water baptism by immersion, and holy communion. The denomination has two practices that are encouraged within the local church - foot washing, and child dedication. The body is Trinitarian, and, like many related bodies, holds that speaking in tongues is the initial evidence of the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Its affiliations are with the Pentecostal/Charismatic Churches of North America, Pentecostal World Conference, a charter member of the National Association of Evangelicals, and the World Evangelical Fellowship. In 2003, the denomination had 4,961 members in 67 churches. Nearly half of its congregations are located in Ohio. The rest are concentrated primarily in Kentucky, Virginia, West Virginia, and North Carolina.

The village is home to many small attractions, including Sturgis Library, the Olde Colonial Courthouse (now Tales of Cape Cod), the Barnstable Comedy Club, and the Trayser Museum. The Sturgis Library was constructed in 1644 for the Reverend John Lothrop, founder of Barnstable. The building is one of the oldest houses remaining on Cape Cod. The house which forms the original part of the library is the oldest building housing a public library in the United States. Since Reverend Lothrop used the front room of the house for public worship, another distinction of the Sturgis Library is that it is the oldest structure still standing in America where religious services were regularly held.

Typically a Lieutenant Colonel commanded each ambulance. All officers of the ambulance were medical doctors or surgeons. Dental units were often attached to the ambulance as well. An ambulance consisted of two sections, the Mobile and the Immobile. The Mobile Section travel with its brigade into combat, where it would establish a Dressing Station. It use stretchers or carts to retrieve the wounded and transport them to the Dressing Station. The Immobile Section established and operated a Receiving Station, which received the wounded the Dressing Station sent on. The ambulance's surgeons would operate on the wounded at the Receiving Station. From the Receiving Station, the sick and wounded would go first to the Casualty Clearing Station and ultimately to a Base Hospital.  Transport  The light horse field ambulances operated in the Middle East theatre: Egypt, the Sinai peninsula, Palestine and Syria. The methods used to transport the wounded had to operate effectively in the sandy, dusty environment. ; Stretcher : As in infantry field ambulances, stretchers were used for transport over short distances, rough terrain or when enemy fire prevented the safe employment of bearer animals. ; Cycle stretcher : These were unpopular and ineffective; after the Gaza battles the forces abandoned the use of cycle stretchers. ; Sand cart : The mainstay of the transport section was the sand cart. It featured wide steel rims and was designed be able to carry three stretchers over soft sand. Six horses or mules provided the motive power. The sand cart was poorly suited to operating on the hard, rough ground of Palestine and Syria, and breakdowns were frequent. ; Sand sledge : Used to transport one stretcher case over sand; two horses pulled the sledge. ; Light ambulance wagon : Drawn by a four horse team, the light ambulance wagon was designed by Surgeon Colonel W.D.C.

She was named after the Battle of Attu in the Aleutian Islands and was built for service during World War II. Launched in May 1944, and commissioned in June, she served as a transport carrier, ferrying aircraft, and as a replenishment carrier, supporting the Invasion of Iwo Jima and the Battle of Okinawa. Postwar, she participated in Operation Magic Carpet. She was decommissioned in June 1946, and sold for scrapping in January 1947. After a failed acquisition attempt by the Jewish Agency, she was ultimately scrapped in 1949. Design and description A profile of the design of , which was shared with all Casablanca-class escort carriers. Attu was a Casablanca-class escort carrier, the most numerous type of aircraft carriers ever built, and designed specifically to be mass-produced using prefabricated sections, in order to replace heavy early war losses. Standardized with her sister ships, she was long overall, had a beam of , and a draft of . She displaced standard, with a full load. She had a long hangar deck and a long flight deck. She was powered with two Skinner Unaflow reciprocating steam engines, which drove two shafts, providing , thus enabling her to make . The ship had a cruising range of at a speed of . Her compact size necessitated the installment of an aircraft catapult at her bow, and there were two aircraft elevators to facilitate movement of aircraft between the flight and hangar deck: one each fore and aft. One /38 caliber dual-purpose gun was mounted on the stern. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by eight Bofors anti-aircraft guns in single mounts, as well as twelve Oerlikon cannons, which were mounted around the perimeter of the deck. By the end of the war, Casablanca-class carriers had been modified to carry thirty 20-mm cannons, and the amount of 40-mm guns had been doubled to sixteen, by putting them into twin mounts. These modifications were in response to increasing casualties due to kamikaze attacks. Casablanca-class escort carriers were designed to carry 27 aircraft, but the hangar deck could accommodate more. Construction Her construction was awarded to Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, Vancouver, Washington under a Maritime Commission contract, on 18 June 1942. She was ordered under the name Elbour Bay (a misspelling of \\"Elbow Bay\\"), as part of a tradition which named escort carriers after bays or sounds in Alaska. She was renamed Attu, after the Battle of Attu, on 6 November 1943, as part of a new naval policy which named subsequent Casablanca-class carriers after naval or land engagements. The escort carrier was laid down on 16 March 1944, MC hull 1139, the forty-seventh of a series of fifty Casablanca-class escort carriers. She was launched on 27 May 1944; sponsored by Mrs. George W. Steele; transferred to the United States Navy and commissioned on 30 June 1944, with Captain Henry Fahnestock MacComsey in command. Service history =World War II= Gunnery drills aboard Attu, circa 1944. Upon being commissioned, Attu underwent a shakedown cruise down the West Coast to San Diego. On 7 August, she departed San Diego, transporting aircraft and passengers to Pearl Harbor. She then took on another load of aircraft and personnel, and proceeded west, making stops at Guadalcanal and Espiritu Santo. Upon finishing her transport run, she got underway on her return trip on 31 August. She arrived at San Diego on 13 September, where overhaul was conducted. On 28 September, she sailed north to Alameda, California, where she loaded fuel, supplies, and replenishment aircraft. She departed the West Coast on 1 October, bound for Finschhafen, New Guinea, arriving there on 18 October. She then stopped at Seeadler Harbor in Manus Island, before returning via Pearl Harbor back to Alameda. She departed yet again on 23 November, bound for Pearl Harbor. Upon arriving, she began ferrying supplies and troops between Pearl Harbor and Guam. She finished her duties and returned to San Diego on 4 January 1945. After a short period of rest, she sailed again on 20 January, arriving at Pearl Harbor on 27 January. There, she conducted gunnery exercises in the waters off of Oahu. She concluded her exercises and steamed for Enewetak Atoll on 1 February. Pausing briefly, she proceeded onwards to Ulithi. On 16 February, she departed Ulithi, and was assigned to Task Group 50.8.4 (Logistics Support Group), along with the escort carriers , , and . This task group was responsible for ferrying and transferring replenishment aircraft to the frontline Fifth Fleet and its carriers, which were supporting the Invasion of Iwo Jima. Wrecked aircraft strewn about the flight deck of Attu following Typhoon Connie. After transferring all of her aircraft, Attu returned to Guam for replacement of her aircraft and supplies. She then sailed westwards again, and served as a replenishment carrier again, this time in support of the landings on Okinawa. This time, her task group was responsible for resupplying both the escort carriers and the fleet carriers operating over the island. On 4 June, were being refueled by tankers, east of Okinawa. Throughout the day, winds began to pick up, and refueling operations had ceased by the time tropical storm force winds were reported in the late afternoon. In fact, Attus task group was directly in the path of Typhoon Connie, which was proceeding northwards. As Admiral William Halsey Jr., the commander of the Third Fleet, got word of the typhoon, his orders ended up driving a large part of his fleet directly into the path of the incoming storm. Amazingly, Halsey had previously blundered his way into Typhoon Cobra, with much damage and loss of life, in December 1944. As part of the Logistics Support Group, Attu witnessed the worst of the damage, weathering the eyewall of the storm. As night fell, it became evident that the task group could not avoid encountering the typhoon. The storm's eyewall struck on the early morning of 5 June, and by 3:30, hurricane-force winds had already been reported. At around 4:00, some flags tore off Attu, and wrapped around her radarscope, rendering her blind to the location of the other ships around her. Consequently, she only narrowly avoided, with careful manipulation of the engines, a collision with the tankers. Her crew noted that the bow once came as close as to a catastrophic collision with a tanker's stern. The typhoon's winds blew several aircraft on board her flight deck off her side, and rendered inoperational or otherwise damaged many more. As she passed through the eye of the storm, the crew managed to unfurl the flags blocking her radar, enabling her to pass through the second half of the storm without much further damage. On 10 June, Captain Paul Hubert Ramsey took over command of the vessel. In early July, she retired back to San Diego for much belayed repairs of her typhoon damage. On 24 July, with repairs quickly concluded, she steamed westwards. She was sailing through a fueling area in the West Pacific when news of the Japanese surrender broke. =Post-war= Following the end of the war, she sailed back to California, arriving on 11 November. On 25 November, she joined the \\"Magic Carpet\\" fleet, which repatriated U.S. servicemen from throughout the Pacific. She cruised around the Pacific, making stops and returning U.S. servicemen back to the mainland. She completed her \\"Magic Carpet\\" duties, and was discharged in early 1946. By May 1946, Attu was slated for disposal by the Navy. She sailed for Norfolk, Virginia, passing through the Panama Canal and making a stop at Jacksonville, Florida. She was decommissioned on 8 June, and she was struck from the Navy list on 3 July. After Attu was decommissioned, she was acquired by representatives of the Jewish Agency in New York. The representatives, led by Yehuda Arazi, planned to use the ship to transport up to 10,000 Jews to Palestine, where they wanted to establish a Jewish state. In addition, they planned to utilize the carrier to ferry a large quantity of armaments for the Haganah, the paramilitary precursor of what would become the Israeli Defense Forces in 1948. An initial payment of about $10,000 () was arranged, and a refit was scheduled to prepare the ship. However, the United States Department of State discovered the plan and cancelled the deal; this allowed Attu to be scrapped in 1949. Attu received two battle stars for her World War II service.

Inman graduated from Princeton University in 1982 with an A.B. in English literature. Career Postrel was editor-in- chief of Reason from July 1989 to January 2000, and remained on the masthead as editor-at-large through 2001. Prior to that, she was a reporter for Inc. and the Wall Street Journal. She currently serves on the Board of Directors of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE). From 2000 to 2006, she wrote an economics column for the New York Times and from 2006 to 2009 she wrote the \\"Commerce and Culture\\" column for The Atlantic. She also appeared on the last episode of the third season of Penn and Teller's Bullshit!. Postrel wrote the biweekly column \\"Commerce & Culture\\" for the Wall Street Journal until April 2011. Since May 2011, she has written a biweekly column for Bloomberg View. She is best known for her non-fiction books including The Future and Its Enemies and The Substance of Style. In the former she explains her philosophy, \\"dynamism\\", a forward-looking and change-seeking philosophy that generally favors unregulated organization through \\"spontaneous order\\". She contrasts it with \\"stasis\\", a philosophy that favors top-down control and regulation and is marked by desire to maintain the present state of affairs. In November 2013, she published a third book, The Power of Glamour, which defined glamour as \\"nonverbal rhetoric\\" that ‚Äúleads us to feel that the life we dream of exists, and to desire it even more.‚ÄùSilber, Kenneth (2013-11-01). \\"Review: The Power of Glamour.\\" Quicksilber.

Health care, bioethics, and aesthetics Postrel has written several articles on health care and bioethics, including accounts of her own experiences. In March 2006 Postrel donated a kidney to an acquaintance, writer Sally Satel. She has recounted the experience, and referred to it in several subsequent articles and blog posts, many of which are critical of legal prohibitions against compensating organ donors. In some of the pieces, she discusses strategies for working around these restrictions, such as organ donor transplant chains. In her March 2009 article \\"My Drug Problem\\" in The Atlantic, Postrel wrote about her own experience of being treated for breast cancer with the expensive drug Herceptin. She questioned if such a costly treatment would be available to others and if the risky research that makes such innovative treatments possible would be profitable under the proposed health care reforms in the United States. Postrel has also referred to her experience as a cancer patient in her writing about the importance of design aesthetics in hospitals and the competitive forces that drive them to create more attractive environments for patients. This ties into the thesis of her second book, that beauty is more than simply a superficial, frivolous trait and can go more than skin deep. Notions of beauty and desirability, and thoughts on what makes good design good beyond the needs of sound engineering, informed her work at the \\"Deep Glamour\\" blog.

Originally planned to last ten days, the assembly did not endorse the charter until January 4, 2004. As has been generally the case with these assemblies, the endorsement came by way of consensus rather than a vote. Afghanistan's last constitution was drafted for the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan in November 1987.  Drafting the Constitution  The Bonn Agreement of December 2001 required Afghanistan to draft and adopt a new constitution within 2 years. In October 2002, Interim President Hamid Karzai appointed a nine-member Constitutional Drafting Commission, chaired by then Vice-President Nematullah Shahrani. Over the next six months, this body drafted a new constitution, based largely on the 1964 Afghan constitution. The initial draft, written primarily by Abdul Salam Azimi (who would become Chief Justice of Afghanistan's Supreme Court in 2006) was not the subject of in-depth political consultation. In April 2003, Interim President Karzai passed a decree appointing a new 35-member Constitutional Commission and laying out a public consultation process. This commission travelled widely throughout the country and reworked the draft, which was not released to the public until November 2003, only weeks before the Constitutional Convention (Loya Jirga) was scheduled to begin. This process was supported by several international institutions that provided funding, mostly through the UN, and expertise.  Selecting the Loya Jirga delegates  In July 2003, a Presidential Decree outlined the process for delegate selection for the Constitutional Loya Jirga (CLJ), stating that there would be 500 delegates, 344 elected by caucus at the district level, 64 women elected by caucus at the provincial level, 42 delegates from refugee, nomad, and minority communities, and 50 people (25 men, 25 women) appointed by President Karzai. The delegates included activists such as Shukria Barakzai, who campaigns for women's rights.  Issues addressed  Issues involving substantial debate included whether Afghanistan should have a presidential or parliamentary system, whether Dari or Pashto should be the official language, and whether other local languages would be recognized, whether former king Mohammed Zahir Shah should maintain the title \\"father of the nation,\\" how to address women's rights, whether Afghanistan should be a free market economy, and whether higher education should be free. The heaviest debate surrounded the question of the presidential vs. parliamentary system. Interim President Hamid Karzai supported a draft constitution the created a presidential system, which would provide one nationally elected figure who could effectively direct the executive branch. Others argued that for an ethnically diverse country coming out of years of conflict - a power-sharing model with a strong President presented the best hope for national unity and reconciliation. At one point President Karzai threatened that he would not run for the office in 2004 if a parliamentary system or semi-presidential system was created. Members of the Tajik-dominated Northern Alliance accused Karzai of buying off opponents with promises of influential positions in a post-election government. On January 1, the loya jirga broke down when close to half of the assembly, consisting mostly of Uzbek, Tajik, Hazara and Turkmen minorities, boycotted the only ballot, forcing chairman Sibghatullah Mojaddedi to call for a 2-day adjourning.  Election of chairman, committees  The Loya jirga was convened on 14 December, beneath a large tent at the newly refurbished technical university in Kabul. In the opening ceremonies, a dozen children in various traditional costumes waved Afghan flags and sang songs of peace, including \\"We are doves, waiting for peace, we are tired of fighting.\\" Former king Mohammad Zahir Shah addressed the assembly. Then Mojaddedi was elected chairman, winning 252 votes, over Abdul Hafiz Mansoor's 154. Deputies were elected, but excluded women. Many of the 114 female delegates protested at not being represented in the secretariat. To assuage their concerns, Mojaddedi appointed Safia Sediqi to the fourth deputy position and two other women as deputies' assistants. Members of constitutional commissions, supreme court and other government officials, and members of legal and human rights commissions were allowed to attend, but not vote. Provincial governors and top-ranking police, administration, and military officials were barred from the proceedings. Delegates were divided among ten committees to consider amendments to the draft constitution, which were submitted to a reconciliation council. Powerful militia leaders had been among the groups, often dominating the process. On the third day, Malalai Joya , a female delegate from Farah Province, was temporarily evicted, having complained that the warlords would still be in charge of the new government. Her microphone was turned off when she suggested that some of the leaders should be tried in an international court. She remained under U.N. protection for several days because of death threats. Ms. Joya aroused controversy when she condemned the allocation of positions of influence at the council to certain faction leaders, including former president Burhanuddin Rabbani and Abdul Rasul Sayyaf, a deeply conservative Islamist.  Malalai Joya's Historical Speech  On December 17, 2003, Malalai Joya, 25, from Farah Province delivered the following speech which received wide coverage in the media internationally: \\"My name is Malalai Joya from Farah Province. By the permission of the esteemed attendees, and by the name of God and the colored-shroud martyrs of the path of freedom, I would like to speak for couple of minutes. My criticism on all my compatriots is that why are they allowing the legitimacy and legality of this Loya Jerga come under question with the presence of those felons who brought our country to this state. I feel pity and I feel very sorry that those who call Loya Jerga an infidel basis equivalent to blasphemy after coming here their words are accepted, or please see the committees and what people are whispering about. The chairman of every committee is already selected. Why do you not take all these criminals to one committee so that we see what they want for this nation. These were those who turned our country into the nucleus of national and international wars. They were the most anti-women people in the society who wanted to [makes pause] who brought our country to this state and they intend to do the same again. I believe that it is a mistake to test those already being tested. They should be taken to national and international court. If they are forgiven by our people, the bare- footed Afghan people, our history will never forgive them. They are all recorded in the history of our country.\\" Name controversy Delegates collected more than the necessary 151 signatures calling for the word \\"Islamic\\" to be removed from the draft constitution, suggesting \\"Republic of Afghanistan\\" instead. Despite enough signatures, the jirga's chairman Sibghatullah Mojaddedi refused to hold a vote and publicly called the deleagates \\"infidels\\", causing concern on freedom of speech.https://www.dawn.com/news/346577/mujaddedi-callsdelegates-infidel  Ratification  After weeks of contentious debate, a walkout by the chair and hundreds of delegates, and dozens of amendments, the loya jirga ratified the constitution without taking a vote, but by consensus, on January 4, 2004. Many delegates complained that the process had no specific criteria, that the rules of procedure were not followed, and that delegates were not properly prepared or educated about the issues. There were also complaints that many of the most important decisions were made by militia and party leaders, Karzai's favorites, and international representatives, such as US envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, behind the scenes. A documentary film, \\"Hell of a Nation\\", produced and directed by Tamara Gould, Bonnie Cohen, and John Schenk, and aired on PBS's \\"Wide Angle\\" series covered the Afghan constitutional process in detail.

The current scientific name is from Ancient Greek. The genus name, Calandrella, is a diminutive of kalandros, the calandra lark, and brachydactila is from brakhus, \\"short\\", and daktulos, \\"toe\\". It breeds in southern Europe, north-west Africa, and across the Palearctic from Turkey and southern Russia to Mongolia. During migration they form large, tight flocks that move in unison; at other times they form loose flocks. Taxonomy and systematics The greater short-toed lark was described by the German naturalist Johann Leisler in 1814 and given the binomial name Alauda brachydactila. This lark is now placed in the genus Calandrella that was established by another German naturalist, Johann Jakob Kaup, in 1829. The specific name brachydactyla is from the Ancient Greek Œ≤œÅŒ±œáœÖŒ¥Œ±Œ∫œÑœÖŒªŒøœÇ brakhudaktulos \\"short-toed\\" from brakhus \\"short\\" and daktulos \\"toe\\". The alternate name short-toed lark may also be used for three other species in the genus Calandrella. The Mongolian short-toed lark was formerly considered as a subspecies of the greater short-toed lark (as C. b. dukhunensis) until split in 2016 by the IOC. Formerly, some authorities also considered the red-capped lark to be either conspecific (as C. cinerea) with or a subspecies (as C. b. cinerea) of the greater short-toed lark. = Subspecies = Eight subspecies are recognized: * European greater short-toed lark (C. b. brachydactyla) or Palestine short-toed lark - (Leisler, 1814): Found in southern Europe, on Mediterranean islands and in north-western Africa. * Hungarian greater short- toed lark (C. b. hungarica) - Horv√°th, 1956: Found in Hungary and northern Serbia * North African greater short-toed lark (C. b. rubiginosa) - Fromholz, 1913: Found in northern Africa * Levant greater short-toed lark (C. b. hermonensis) - Tristram, 1865: Originally described as a separate species. Found from southern Turkey and Syria to north-eastern Egypt * BIrelandcik greater short-toed lark (C. b. woltersi) - Kumerloeve, 1969: Found in southern Turkey and north-western Syria * Transcaucasian greater short-toed lark (C. b. artemisiana) - Banjkovski, 1913: Found from central Turkey and Transcaucasia to north-western Iran * Steppe greater short-toed lark (C. b. longipennis) - (Eversmann, 1848): Originally described as a separate species in the genus Alauda. Also known as Eastern short-toed lark (a name also used by the Asian short-toed lark) or Yarkand short-toed lark. Found from Ukraine and southern Russia to south-central Siberia and southern Mongolia * C. b. orientalis - Sushkin, 1925: Found in central Siberia, northern Mongolia and northern China Description From Khangchendzonga National Park, West Sikkim, India. Greater Short-toed Lark Several subspecies have been named but there is considerable geneflow and the species itself forms part of a larger complex. This is a small pale lark, smaller than the skylark. It is dark-streaked greyish-brown above, and white below, and has a strong pointed bill that is pinkish with a grey culmen. It has a pale supercilium, dark patches on each side of its neck and a dark tail. Some birds in the west of the range have a rufous crown. The sexes are similar. The greater short-toed lark is paler than the Mongolian short-toed lark which also has a shorter bill. In winter they fly in large and compact flocks that swing in synchrony. Care must be taken to distinguish this species from other similar Calandrella larks, such as the lesser short-toed lark. The nominate form breeds in Europe (Iberia, France, Italy, the Balkans and Romania) and winters in Africa. Subspecies hungarica breeds in the eastern parts of Europe while rubiginosa breeds in north-western Africa. Subspecies hermonensis (sometimes including woltersi) breeds in Turkey, Syria and Egypt. Subspecies artemisiana (considered by some to be synonymous with longipennis) breeds in Asia Minor and winters in southern west Asia. Subspecies longipennis breeds in Ukraine, Mongolia and Manchuria and winters in South Asia mainly in the drier zone of north-western India. The song varies between a dry twittering and a more varied and imitative melody. Flocks will often fly together to water in the mornings at favourite spots. In the evenings they roost in open ground, with each bird squatting in a small depression made in the soil. Distribution and habitat Calandrella brachydactyla - MHNT All but some southernmost populations are migratory, wintering south to the southern edge of the Sahara and India. This species is a fairly common wanderer to northern and western Europe in spring and autumn. Populations breeding in the Iberian Peninsula winter south of the Sahara in Africa. Here they prefer crop land and dry pastures with short shrubs while the syntopic lesser short-toed larks (Calandrella rufescens) prefer drier areas. This is a common bird of dry open country and cultivation. It nests on the ground, laying two to three eggs. Its food is seeds and insects, the latter especially in the breeding season. In colonial India, they were hunted for food as ortolans. They visit parts of South Asia in large flocks during winter and are sometimes attracted to short grass areas along aerodromes and become a bird strike risk to aircraft.

A Republican, Heinz served in the United States House of Representatives from 1971 to 1977, and in the United States Senate from 1977 until he was killed in a plane crash in Lower Merion Township, Pennsylvania, in 1991. Early life, education and early career Henry John Heinz III was born on October 23, 1938, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the son of Joan (Diehl) and H. J. \\"Jack\\" Heinz II, heir to the H. J. Heinz Company. An only child, Heinz moved to San Francisco, California, with his mother and stepfather, U.S. Navy Captain Clayton Chot \\"Monty\\" McCauley following his parents' divorce in 1942. Although he was raised and primarily resided in San Francisco throughout his childhood, Heinz often spent the summer months with his father in Pittsburgh. In 1956, Heinz graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy. He then attended and graduated from Yale University in 1960, majoring in History, Arts and Letters, where Theodore Stebbins was his roommate. Heinz subsequently graduated from Harvard Business School in 1963. It was during his years at Harvard, during summer break, that he met his future wife, Teresa Sim√µes Ferreira, who attended the University of Geneva. Upon graduating from Harvard Business School in 1963, Heinz served in the United States Air Force Reserve and was on active duty during the same year. He remained in the Air Force Reserve until 1969. Before entering politics, Heinz served as an assistant to Pennsylvania Republican U.S. Senator Hugh Scott and played an active role as assistant campaign manager during Scott's campaign for re-election. Heinz then worked in the financial and marketing division of the H. J. Heinz Company between 1965 and 1970, after which he became a professor of business at the Carnegie Mellon University's Graduate School of Industrial Administration. Political career =U.S. House of Representatives= In 1971, Heinz entered politics after Representative Robert Corbett, who represented Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district, died in office. After winning the Republican primary, Heinz won the special election on November 2, 1971, to fill the vacancy created by Corbett's death. Heinz was re-elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1972 and 1974. =U.S. Senate= Heinz opted not to run for re-election to his seat in the House of Representatives, choosing instead in 1976 to run for Pennsylvania's open United States Senate seat created by the retirement of incumbent Hugh Scott. Heinz won the election, and was subsequently re-elected in 1982 and in 1988. In the Senate, Heinz was a moderate-to-liberal Republican. He was a member of the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, the Committee on Finance, the National Commission on Social Security Reform, the National Commission on Health Care Reform, the Northeast Coalition, and the Steel Caucus. He also served as chairman of the Subcommittee on International Finance and Monetary Policies, the Special Committee on Aging, and the Republican Conference Task Force on Job Training and Education. Heinz voted in favor of the bill establishing Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a federal holiday and the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987 (as well as to override President Reagan's veto). Heinz voted in favor of the Robert Bork Supreme Court nomination. He was elected chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee for two terms, 1979-1981 and 1985-1987. The New York Times noted that Heinz built a solid record in the Senate as \\"a persistent defender of the nation's growing elderly population and of the declining steel industry\\", that he was \\"instrumental in pushing through legislation that put the Social Security system on sounder financial footing,\\" and \\"played a major role in strengthening laws regulating retirement policies, pension plans, health insurance and nursing homes\\", and \\"pushed successfully for trade laws that encourage American exports and protect American products, like steel, from foreign imports.\\" Death On April 4, 1991, Heinz and six other people, including two children, were killed when a Sun Co. Aviation Department Bell 412 helicopter and a Piper Aerostar with Heinz aboard collided in mid-air above Merion Elementary School in Lower Merion Township, Pennsylvania. All aboard both aircraft, as well as two children at the school, were killed. The helicopter had been dispatched to investigate a problem with the landing gear of Heinz's plane. While moving in for a closer look, the helicopter collided with the plane, causing both aircraft to lose control and crash. The subsequent NTSB investigation attributed the cause of the crash to poor judgment by the pilots of the two aircraft involved. Following a funeral at Heinz Chapel in Pittsburgh and a Washington, D.C. memorial service that was attended by President George H. W. Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle, Senator Heinz's remains were interred in the Heinz family mausoleum in Homewood Cemetery, located in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Heinz's long time friend, Senator Tim Wirth of Colorado, remarked: \\"He really believed he could make the world a better place, such a contrast to the jaded resignation of our time. He could send the Senate leadership up a wall faster than anyone I've seen.\\" Heinz's son Andr√© said at the services: \\"Dad, I am so grateful for the time we had, and I miss you and I love you.\\"https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LLgiAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=KrUFAAAAIBAJ&dq;=masloff%20grateful&pg;=2352%2C1755232 Heinz's widow, Teresa Heinz, in 1995 married Heinz's U.S. Senate colleague and future Secretary of State John Kerry. Legacy H. John Heinz III College at Carnegie Mellon University The John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge at Tinicum (formerly known as the Tinicum Wildlife Preserve) was renamed in his honor following his death. The 1,200 acre (4.9 km¬≤) refuge includes the largest remaining freshwater tidal marsh in Pennsylvania, as well as other habitats that are home to a variety of plants and animals native to Southeastern Pennsylvania. His family established the Heinz Awards in 1993, which honor individual innovation in five categories. One of the Jefferson Awards for Public Service annual awards, for \\"Greatest Public Service by an Elected or Appointed Official\\", is named in his honor.

Origin Avellanet was born in Mayag√ºez. Avellanet is of Spanish, Catalan, and Italian descent, his grandfather being an Italian immigrant by the name of Pietro Nuccio. Career Before becoming famous, he had been performing across Puerto Rico's western coast with various musical trios, particularly with the Trio Los Duendes. He was regarded as having a powerful voice, but was too shy to occupy a solo spot in any of the groups he performed with. In fact, Avellanet claimed, he felt better suited to performing comedy, and he did comic sketches at a few high school functions. After he returned from a stint with the Army National Guard in North Carolina he was discovered by Cuban-born television promoter Gaspar Pumarejo, who immediately introduced him to the Puerto Rico television audience. His career formally started during the week of 23‚Äì28 May 1961, when he was featured daily on Pumarejo's show. His first formal live performance was opening for Myrta Silva at a Puerto Rican music review regularly staged at the Tropicoro Room of El San Juan Hotel in Carolina, Puerto Rico now the Wyndham El San Juan Hotel & Casino. He took voice lessons from Puerto Rican soprano Rina de Toledo. Avellanet achieved teen-idol status in Puerto Rico during the 1960s, as a member of the Nueva Ola pop music movement. Helped by Alfred D. Herger, he was a member of a group of teen sensations that included Lissette Alvarez (to whom Avellanet got married), Lucecita Ben√≠tez, Yolandita Monge, Ednita Nazario and Charlie Robles, among others. Such was his popularity that he was booked to do three shows on New Year's Eve 1961 and New Year's Day 1962. With La Nueva Ola, he recorded his first album, titled Fugitiva. His first hit was a Spanish version of Marty Robbins' Devil Woman loosely translated by Herger under the title Magia Blanca (White Magic). He later had his first major international hit with another song adapted to Spanish, a version of pop standard I Can't Stop Loving You titled Jam√°s te olvidar√© (I Will Never Forget You). Avellanet later performed with a group of singers named La Juventud Canta. Although not a conventional music group, La Juventud Canta toured all over Latin America, and Avellanet extended his teen-idol status to other countries such as Mexico, Argentina and Venezuela, where Avellanet enjoyed a solid teen girl fan base. =Crossover= Avellanet would soon join the United Artists record label, making what would be his only attempt at a cross-over into the American pop genre, with the album In a Little Spanish Town. His fourteen other records under that label were recorded in Spanish. In 1965, under United Artist, he recorded the album titled Chucho Avellanet Baladas Spanish Sounds in Country Music produced by LeRoy Holmes. This album featured a choice sampling of the better tunes that had emerged from the world of country and Western music at the time including It Makes No Difference Now (No Me Importa) by Jimmy Davis, and Sinceridad (\\"Are you Sincere?\\") by Wayne Walker/Gil Veda. 1972 was a very eventful year for Avellanet, who represented his country finishing in fourth place at that year's Festival OTI in Spain. Then, Avellanet made history by becoming the first Hispanic to perform at the Miss Universe contest, held that year in the Puerto Rican beach town of Dorado. =Acting career= Chucho Avellanet diversified, and by the 1980s, he was as known for his acting as he was for his singing. Having signed up with Canal 2, he was able to explore his ability both in the show hosting and acting fields when he hosted, alongside Lissette Alvarez, the popular El Show de Chucho y Lissette. He also hosted Senoras y Senores and Con Chucho Avellanet before finally settling on El Show de Chucho. Avellanet also performed comedy on El Show de Chucho, participating in the show's comedy segment. In one particularly memorable comic chapter, he screamed, May the roof fall on us if I'm lying! and the roof then \\"crashed down\\" on him and his guests. He also participated, with Lissette, in a famous Schaefer Beer commercial, where he sang the jingle Cerveza Schaefer es la mejor cuando se toma mas de una (Schaefer is the one beer to have when you're having more than one). During the filming of the commercial, the boat they were on was rocked by a submarine of the United States Navy passing below it; the experience made a lasting impression on him, which years later led him to support the cause of the people of Vieques in their demands to have the Navy vacate their bombing range on Vieques and Culebra. One of Avellanet's biggest international hits during the decade of the '80s came in his song Sera varon, sera mujer? (Will It Be a Boy, Will It Be a Girl?), where he explored the questions couples expecting a baby might ask themselves. This song coincided with his wife's pregnancy, and in his case, his baby turned out to be a boy. He was by then married to his second wife, Venezuelan actress Marisela Berti, whom he later also divorced. In 1988, Avellanet came back to the headlines, but not precisely because of his own, personal success: His nephew Roberto Alejandro Avellanet Negr√≥n was chosen as the newest member of Menudo. Roberto followed in his uncle's footsteps, becoming a major teen-idol in Puerto Rico within months of his joining the teenaged boy band. On stage in San Juan during the 1980s, Avellanet appeared as \\"El Lince\\" in the musical \\"La Verdadera Historia de Pedro Navaja\\", a Caribbean-set adaptation of \\"The Beggar's Opera\\", and \\"Father Silvestre\\" in the Puerto Rican production of \\"El Diluvio que Viene\\" (the Spanish-version of the Italian musical \\"Aggiungi un posto a tavola\\"). He returned to the theater in Puerto Rico in 2014, in a Spanish-language production of \\"Shear Madness\\" (\\"Con los Pelos de Punta\\") In 1989 he starred in \\"Papi\\", a prime-time sitcom on \\"WAPA-TV\\", Puerto Rico's Channel 4, in which he played the superintendent of a condominium with eccentric residents. He sang the show's intro theme song called \\"Yo Soy Como Soy\\" (\\"That's Who I am\\"). He returned to sitcoms in 2012 with \\"Papi en Casa (\\"Dad at Home\\"), on \\"WLII-TV\\", Channel 11, Puerto Rico's \\"Univision\\" affiliate, in which he played a grandfather. In 1994, Avellanet, Lucecita Ben√≠tez and Lissette Alvarez rejoined forces for a one-night-only concert. In 2010, Avellanet performed at the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2010 Central American and Caribbean Games, held in Mayag√ºez. Later in the year he publicly announced that he was undergoing chemotherapy for treating Non- Hodgkin's lymphoma. Stating that his prognosis is good, he nevertheless asked for privacy while undergoing treatment.

Quote: \\"Strategically located on the Pacific Rim and serving one of the most diverse communities in the United States, the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco ‚Äì Chong-Moon Lee Center for Asian Art and Culture is uniquely positioned to lead a diverse, global audience in discovering the distinctive materials, aesthetics and intellectual achievements of Asian art and cultures, and to serve as a bridge of understanding between Asia and the United States and between the diverse cultures of Asia.\\" (emphasis added) houses one of the most comprehensive Asian art collections in the world, with more than 18,000 works of art in its permanent collection, some as much as 6,000 years old. History The museum owes its origin to a donation to the city of San Francisco by Chicago millionaire Avery Brundage, who was a major collector of Asian art. The Society for Asian Art, incorporated in 1958, was the group that formed specifically to gain Avery Brundage's collection. The museum opened in 1966 as a wing of the M. H. de Young Memorial Museum in Golden Gate Park. Brundage continued to make donations to the museum, including the bequest of all his remaining personal collection of Asian art on his death in 1975. In total, Brundage donated more than 7,700 Asian art objects to San Francisco. Jay Xu is the Museum's Director. =Relocation= Until 2003, the museum shared a space with the de Young Museum in Golden Gate Park. As the museum's collection grew, the facilities in Golden Gate Park were no longer sufficient to display or even house the collection. In 1987 Mayor Dianne Feinstein proposed a plan to revitalize Civic Center that included relocating the museum to the Main Library. In 1995, Silicon Valley entrepreneur Chong-Moon Lee made a $15 million donation to launch the funding campaign for a new building for the museum. During its last year in the park it was closed for the purpose of moving to its new location, and it reopened on March 20, 2003, in the former San Francisco city library building opposite the San Francisco Civic Center, renovated for the purpose under the direction of Italian architect Gae Aulenti. Lord Cultural Resources, a cultural professional practice, was also commissioned to undertake a three-part sequence of planning studies for the relocation of the Museum. The old Main library was a Beaux Arts-style building designed by George Kelham in 1917. The new $160.5 million project, designed by Gae Aulenti, introduced an indoor sky-lit court to provide a dramatic central core to the museum. Removing some interior walls, Aulenti created a sense of openness to facilitate visitor movement and the display of the artwork. The new museum increased the exhibition space by approximately 75 percent compared to the former Golden Gate Park location. The renovation also brought a seismic upgrade scheme to the building involving base isolation. Bearings were placed over the foundation system below the building's current slab on grade with a new basement constructed above the bearings in the process. Furthermore the superstructure was stiffened through the addition of concrete shear walls, allowing for a rigid lateral load path for all sections of the building. In October 2011, the museum launched a new identity. Designed by the branding agency Wolff Olins, the logo is an upside down A, representing the idea of approaching Asian art from a new perspective. =Expansion= In March, 2016, the museum announced that it will build an additional new pavilion to its current San Francisco Civic Center Building. The new pavilion will sit atop an existing, lower-level wing on the museum's Hyde Street side; and it will add about 9,000 square feet of new space to the museum's first floor. The expansion is expected to open by September 2019. In January 2019, Abby Chen was appointed as the Head of Contemporary Art. Collection The collection has approximately 18,000 works of art and artifacts from all major Asian countries and traditions, some of which are as much as 6,000 years old. Galleries are devoted to the arts of South Asia, Iran and Central Asia, Southeast Asia, the Himalayas, China, Korea and Japan. There are 2,500 works on display in the permanent collection. The museum has become a focus for special and traveling exhibitions, including: the first major Chinese exhibition to travel outside China since the end of World War II (in 1975), an archaeological exhibition which attracted 800,000 visitors over an eight-week period, and an exhibition on wisdom and compassion opened by the Dalai Lama in 1991.

The name of the tea house can be seen on a wooden plaque \\"In the Mist\\" located next to the Tea House on the second floor of the museum, The calligraphy on this wooden plaque is based on the calligraphy by Yamada Sobin and commissioned by Yoshiko Kakudo, the museum's first curator of Japanese art. The Tea House was designed by architect Osamu Sato as a functioning teahouse, as well as a display case. It is a three and three-quarters (sanjo daime) mat room. It is complete with an alcove for the display of a scroll and flowers, an electric-powered sunken hearth used in winter for the hot water kettle, and a functioning preparation area (mizuya) with fresh running water and drain.

Biography Portrait of Sophie Duchess of Alen√ßon in 1886 by Joseph Albert. Sophie Charlotte was born at the Possenhofen Castle, the residence of her paternal family, Dukes in Bavaria. She was a daughter of Duke Maximilian Joseph in Bavaria (1808‚Äì1888) and Princess Ludovika of Bavaria. The ninth of ten children born to her parents, she was known as Sopherl within the family. She was also a sister of Empress Elisabeth of Austria and Queen Maria Sophie of the Two Sicilies. After the 1861 marriage of her older sister, Duchess Mathilde Ludovika in Bavaria, to the Neapolitan Prince Luis of the Two Sicilies, her parents then looked for a suitable husband for Sophie Charlotte. She was engaged to her cousin King Ludwig II of Bavaria. Their engagement was publicised on 22 January 1867, but after having repeatedly postponed the wedding date, Ludwig finally cancelled it in October, as it seemed Sophie had fallen in love with the court photographer, Edgar Hanfstaengl. Other proposed husbands included the renowned homosexual Archduke Ludwig Viktor of Austria, brother of both Franz Joseph I of Austria and Maximilian I of Mexico, as well as the future Lu√≠s I of Portugal. Another candidate was Duke Philipp of W√ºrttemberg,Son of Princess Marie of Orl√©ans, daughter of Louis Philippe I the first cousin of her eventual husband. She refused all the candidates. She was sent to stay with her aunt, Amalie Auguste, then the Queen of Saxony as wife of King John of Saxony. It was in Saxony Sophie Charlotte met Prince Ferdinand of Orl√©ans (12 July 1844 - 29 June 1910), Duke of Alen√ßon, the son of Prince Louis, Duke of Nemours and grandson of the late King Louis Philippe (died 1850). Soon after, on 28 September 1868, she married him at Possenhofen Castle, near Starnberg. She had a good relationship with her husband as well as with her sister-in-law Princess Marguerite Ad√©la√Øde of Orl√©ans, wife of Prince W≈Çadys≈Çaw Czartoryski. Her mother in law, Princess Victoria of Saxe- Coburg and Gotha, cousin of Queen Victoria, had died in 1857. Sophie Charlotte did not have an overly good relationship with her father-in-law, the widowed Duke of Nemours. The year after their marriage, the ducal couple moved into Bushy House in the Teddington area of Southwest London, where Sophie Charlotte gave birth to her first child, Princess Louise of Orl√©ans. Prophetically, Sophie Charlotte wrote out her last will and testament on 4 October 1896, seven months before her death. She died in a fire at the Bazar de la Charit√© in Paris on 4 May 1897, where she had been helping to raise funds for charity. She refused to be rescued, insisting that the girls, visitors and nuns working alongside her at the bazaar be saved first. A Dominican nun who had managed to escape from the inferno explained that she saw the Duchess get down on her knees and start praying. Identifying Sophie Charlotte's remains was not easy; her personal maid was unable to recognise the body, as it had been severely disfigured by the fire, so the Duchess's dentist, M. Lavanport, was called in. After two hours examining various bodies, he identified Sophie Charlotte on the basis of her gold fillings.L'Avenir, May 7, 1897. Thus she became one of the first people whose remains were identified by forensic dentistry. Her sister, Empress Elisabeth of Austria, was assassinated the following year.

Its traditional role is to provide a working surface barely large enough to write notes while speaking on the telephone, and in some cases to support the telephone or hold telephone books. In early generations of telephones the phone apparatus itself had a small desk built in. This was most common in wall mounted telephones of the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century. The illustrations show front and side views of such an antique wall phone with a small slanted desk surface fitted with two ridges to keep paper and pencil from falling to the floor. The telephone desk has usually been a domestic piece of furniture. In an office a telephone would normally be placed on any form of desk, as close as possible to its users. Many 20th century telephone booths or call boxes had a tiny built-in desk surface for the convenience of customers. Vandalism and a higher concern for costs has led to the gradual elimination of these minuscule desk surfaces. See also *Desk and bench *List of desk forms and types. References * Mr Chips 101 plans.

It is a common bird with a very wide range and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\". Confusingly, Hume's short-toed lark is also sometimes called the lesser short-toed lark. Taxonomy and systematics The Lesser short-toed lark was originally described as belonging to the genus Alauda. The genus name Alaudala is a diminutive of Alauda, and the specific rufescens is Latin for \\"reddish\\", from rufus \\"red\\". Alternate names for the lesser short-toed lark include the common short-toed lark, grey lark, rufous short-toed lark and short-toed lark. Formerly or presently, some authorities considered the Athi short-toed lark, Asian short-toed lark and/or the Somali short-toed lark to be subspecies of the lesser short-toed lark. A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2020 compared the nuclear and mitochondrial DNA from the sand, Asian short-toed, and lesser short-toed larks. The study analysed samples from 130 individuals that represented 16 of the 18 recognised subspecies. The resulting phylogenetic tree indicated that neither the Asian short-toed lark, nor the lesser short-toed lark as currently defined are monophyletic. Most of the subspecies were also found to be non-monophyletic. The authors refrained from proposing a revised taxonomy until additional studies had been completed comparing the vocalizations, sexual behaviour and ecology. = Subspecies = Nine subspecies are recognized: * A. r. rufescens - (Vieillot, 1819): Found on Tenerife (west-central Canary Islands) * A. r. polatzeki - (Hartert, 1904): Found in eastern Canary Islands * A. r. apetzii - (Brehm, AE, 1857): Found in eastern and southern Iberian Peninsula * A. r. minor - (Cabanis, 1851): Found from Morocco to north-western Egypt and southern Turkey to the Sinai Peninsula and eastern Iraq * A. r. nicolli - (Hartert, 1909): Found in the Nile Delta (northern Egypt) * A. r. pseudobaetica - (Stegmann, 1932): Found in eastern Turkey, Transcaucasia and northern Iran * A. r. heinei - (Homeyer, 1873): Found from Ukraine to eastern Kazakhstan * A. r. aharonii - (Hartert, 1910): Found in central Turkey * A. r. persica - Sharpe, 1890: Found in eastern and southern Iraq to southern and south-western Afghanistan Description The lesser short-toed lark is similar in size and appearance to the greater short- toed lark but is generally a duller-looking bird with a more streaked breast. It grows to a length of from and the sexes are similar. As with the greater short-toed lark, the colour varies across the broad range and is not a good distinguishing feature. It is dark-streaked greyish-brown above, and white below. It has a pale supercilium, and a short stubby bill. Care must be taken to distinguish this species from the Calandrella larks. This species lacks the dark neck patches of the greater, and has fine streaking across the breast. The bill and head shape also differ, this species having a shorter, less- conical bill and a more-rounded, smaller head. The song is richer, more varied and imitative than that of its relative. Distribution and habitat The lesser short-toed lark breeds in Spain, north Africa, also including Turkey eastwards across the semi-deserts of central Asia to Mongolia and China. Many populations, including the Spanish and African breeders, are sedentary (non- migratory), but some Asian birds from the north of the breeding range migrate south in winter. This species is a very rare wanderer to northern and western Europe. Behaviour and ecology This is a bird of dry open country, preferring even drier and barer soils than the greater short-toed lark. It nests on the ground, laying two or three eggs. Its food is seeds and insects, the latter especially in the breeding season.

It generally does not explicate names of individual people or their political associations; those can be found in List of people associated with the French Revolution. The terminology routinely used in discussing the French Revolution can be confusing, even daunting. The same political faction may be referred to by different historians (or by the same historian in different contexts) by different names. During much of the revolutionary period, the French used a newly invented calendar that fell into complete disuse after the revolutionary era. Different legislative bodies had rather similar names, not always translated uniformly into English. This article is intended as a central place to clarify these issues. For citations see the articles and also Ballard (2011); Furet (1989) Hanson (2004), Ross (1998) and Scott & Rothaus (1985). The three estates The estates of the realm in ancien r√©gime France were: *First Estate (Premi√®r √âtat, le clerg√© ) ‚Äì The clergy, both high (generally siding with the nobility, and it often was recruited amongst its younger sons) and low. *Second Estate (Second √âtat, la noblesse ) ‚Äì The nobility. Technically, but not usually of much relevance, the Second Estate also included the Royal Family. *Third Estate (Tiers √âtat) ‚Äì Everyone not included in the First or Second Estate. At times this term refers specifically to the bourgeoisie, the middle class, but the Third Estate also included the sans-culottes, the labouring class. Also included in the Third Estate were lawyers, merchants, and government officials. See also: Fourth Estate, a term with two relevant meanings: on the one hand, the generally unrepresented poor, nominally part of the Third Estate; on the other, the press, as a fourth powerful entity in addition to the three estates of the realm. Social classes *Royalty ‚Äì House of Bourbon, After the Empire was established. *Nobility (noblesse) ‚Äì Those with explicit noble title. These are traditionally divided into **noblesse d'√©p√©e (\\"nobility of the sword\\"), the hereditary gentry and nobility who originally had to perform military service in exchange for their titles. **noblesse de robe (\\"nobility of the gown\\"), the magisterial class that administered royal justice and civil government, often referring to those who earned a title of nobility through generations of long periods of public service (bureaucrats and civil servants) or bought it (rich merchants). **noblesse de cloche (\\"nobility of the bell\\"), mayors and aldermen of certain cities under royal charter were considered gentry. Some mayors and aldermen held a noble title for life after a long period of service in office. **Noblesse de race, (\\"Nobility through breeding\\"), The \\"old\\" nobility, who inherited their titles from time immemorial. **Noblesse d‚Äôextraction, Nobility of seize-quartiers (\\"sixteen Quarterings\\"); having pure noble or gentle ancestry for four generations. **Noblesse de lettres (\\"Nobility through letters patent\\"), The \\"new\\" nobility, from after circa 1400 AD. *Ci-devant nobility (literally \\"from before\\"): nobility of the ancien r√©gime (the Bourbon kingdom) after it had lost its titles and privileges. *Bourgeoisie (literally \\"Suburbanites\\") ‚Äì Roughly, the non-noble wealthy and the middle classes: typically merchants, investors, and professionals such as doctors and lawyers. The dwellers in the small bourgs (\\"walled towns and communities\\") outside the city. *Active and passive citizens ‚Äì During the period of the Legislative Assembly, approximately half of the men of France were disfranchised as \\"passive citizens\\". Only \\"active citizens\\", a category based on taxes paid, could vote; they also formed the basis of the National Guard. *Sans-culottes ‚Äì literally \\"those without breeches\\", the masses of Paris. *Peasants, who represent 90 percent of the French nation's population. Constitutions *Liberal monarchical constitution ‚Äì Adopted 6 October 1789, accepted by the King 14 July 1790. *The Constitution of 1791 or Constitution of 3 September 1791 ‚Äì Establishes a limited monarchy and the Legislative Assembly. *The Constitution of 1793, Constitution of 24 June 1793 (Acte constitutionnel du 24 juin 1793, or Montagnard Constitution (Constitution montagnarde) ‚Äì Ratified, but never applied, due to the suspension of all ordinary legality 10 October 1793. *The Constitution of the Year III, Constitution of 22 August 1795, Constitution of the Year III, or Constitution of 5 Fructidor ‚Äì Establishes the Directory. *The Constitution of the Year VIII ‚Äì Adopted 24 December 1799, establishes the Consulate. *The Constitution of the Year X ‚Äì Establishes a revised Consulate, with Napoleon as First Consul for Life. *The Constitution of the Year XII ‚Äì Establishes Bonaparte's First Empire. Governmental structures In roughly chronological order: *The ancien r√©gime ‚Äì The absolute monarchy under the Bourbon kings, generally considered to end some time between the meeting of the Estates-General on 5 May 1789, and the liberal monarchical constitution of 6 October 1789. *Parlements ‚Äì Royal Law courts in Paris and most provinces under the ancien r√©gime. *The Estates-General, also known as States-General (Etats-G√©n√©raux) ‚Äì The traditional tricameral legislature of the ancien r√©gime, which had fallen into disuse since 1614. The convention of the Estates-General of 1789 is one of the events that led to the French Revolution. The Estates General, as such, met 5‚Äì6 May 1789, but reached an impasse because the Third Estate refused to continue to participate in this structure. The other two estates continued to meet in this form for several more weeks. *The Communes ‚Äì The body formed 11 May 1789, by the Third Estate after seceding from the Estates General. On 12 June 1789, the Communes invited the other orders to join them: some clergy did so the following day. *The National Assembly (Assembl√©e Nationale) ‚Äì Declared 17 June 1789, by the Communes. The clergy joined them June 19. This was soon reconstituted as... *The National Constituent Assembly (Assembl√©e nationale constituante); also loosely referred to as the National Assembly ‚Äì From 9 July 1789 to 30 September 1791, this was both the governing and the constitution‚Äìdrafting body of France. It dissolved itself in favour of: *The Legislative Assembly (Assembl√©e Legislative) ‚Äì From 1 October 1791, to September 1792, the Legislative Assembly, elected by voters with property qualifications, governed France under a constitutional monarchy, but with the removal of the king's veto power on 11 July 1792, was a republic in all but name, and became even more so after the subsequent arrest of the Royal Family. *The Paris Commune ‚Äì During the waning days of the Legislative Assembly and the fall of the Monarchy, the municipal government of Paris functioned, at times, in the capacity of a national government, as a rival, a goad, or a bully to the Legislative Assembly. **Further, the Sections were directly democratic mass assemblies in Paris during the first four years of the Revolution. *The Provisional Executive Committee ‚Äì Headed by Georges Danton, this also functioned in August‚ÄìSeptember 1792 as a rival claimant to national power. *The National Convention, or simply The Convention ‚Äì First met 20 September 1792; two days later, declared a republic. The National Convention after the fall of the Montagnards (27 July 1794) is sometimes referred to as the \\"Thermidorian Convention\\". Three committees of the National Convention are particularly worthy of note: **The Committee of Public Safety (Comit√© de salut public) ‚Äì During the Reign of Terror, this committee was effectively the government of France. After the fall of the Montagnards, the committee continued, but with reduced powers. **The Committee of General Security (Comit√© de s√ªret√© g√©n√©rale) ‚Äì Coordinated the War effort. **The Committee of Education (Comit√© de l'instruction) **The Revolutionary Tribunal (Tribunal r√©volutionaire) instituted in March‚ÄìOctober 1793 to prosecute all threats to the revolutionary republic, was the effective agent of the Comit√© de Salut Public's reign of terror in Paris until its dissolution on 31 May 1795. *The Directory (Directoire) ‚Äì From 22 August 1795, the Convention was replaced by the Directory, a bicameral legislature that more or less institutionalized the dominance of the bourgeoisie while also enacting a major land reform that was henceforward to place the peasants firmly on the political right. The rightward move was so strong that monarchists actually won the election of 1797 but were stopped from taking power by the coup of 18 Fructidor (4 September 1797), the first time Napoleon played a direct role in government. The Directory continued (politically quite far to the left of its earlier self) until Napoleon took power in his own right, 9 November 1799 (or 18 Brumaire), the date that is generally counted as the end of the French Revolution. The Directory itself was the highest executive organ, comprising five Directors, chosen by the Ancients out of a list elected by the Five Hundred; its legislative was bicameral, consisting of: **The Council of Five Hundred (Conseil des Cinq-Cents), or simply the Five Hundred. **The Council of Ancients (Conseil des Anciens), or simply the Ancients or the Senate. *The Consulate (Consulat) ‚Äì The period of the Consulate (December 1799 ‚Äì December 1804) is only ambiguously part of the revolutionary era. The government was led by three individuals known as Consuls. From the start, Napoleon Bonaparte served as First Consul (Premier Consul) of the Republic. In May 1802, a plebiscite made Bonaparte First Consul for Life. In May 1804 the Empire was declared, bringing the Revolutionary era to a yet more definitive end. *The tribunat was one of the legislative chambers instituted by the Constitution of year VIII, composed of 100 members nominated by the Senate to discuss the legislative initiatives defended by the government's Orateurs in the presence of the Corps l√©gislatif; abolished in 1807 Political groupings * Royalists or Monarchists ‚Äì Generally refers specifically to supporters of the Bourbon monarchy and can include both supporters of absolute and constitutional monarchy. See Reactionary. * Jacobins ‚Äì strictly, a member of the Jacobin club, but more broadly any revolutionary, particularly the more radical bourgeois elements. * Feuillants ‚Äì Members of the Club des Feuillants, result of a split within the Jacobins, who favoured a constitutional monarchy over a republic. * Republicans ‚Äì Advocates of a system without a monarch. * The Gironde ‚Äì Technically, a group of twelve republican deputies more moderate in their tactics than the Montagnards, though arguably many were no less radical in their beliefs; the term is often applied more broadly to others of similar politics. Members and adherents of the Gironde are variously referred to as \\"Girondists\\" (\\"Girondins\\") or \\"Brissotins\\" * The Mountain (Montagne) ‚Äì The radical republican grouping in power during the Reign of Terror; its adherents are typically referred to as \\"Montagnards\\". * Septembriseurs ‚Äì The Mountain and others (such as Georges Danton) who were on the rise in the period of the September Massacres * Thermidorians or Thermidoreans ‚Äì The more moderate (some would say reactionary) grouping that came to power after the fall of the Mountain. * Society of the Panth√©on, also known as Conspiracy of the Equals, and as the Secret Directory ‚Äì faction centered around Fran√ßois-No√´l Babeuf, who continued to hold up a radical Jacobin viewpoint during the period of the Thermidorian reaction. * Bonapartists ‚Äì Supporters of Napoleon Bonaparte, especially those who supported his taking on the role of Emperor. * √âmigr√©s ‚Äì This term usually refers to those conservatives and members of the elite who left France in the period of increasingly radical revolutionary ascendancy, usually under implied or explicit threat from the Terror. (Generically, it can refer to those who left at other times or for other reasons.) Besides the √©migr√©s having their property taken by the State, relatives of √©migr√©s were also persecuted. Ancien r√©gime taxes *Corv√©e ‚Äì A royal or seigneurial tax, taken in the form of forced labour. It came in many forms, including compulsory military service and compulsory tillage of fields. Most commonly, the term refers to a royal corv√©e requiring peasants to maintain the king's roads. *Gabelle ‚Äì A tax on salt. *Taille ‚Äì A royal tax, in principle pro capita, whose amount was fixed before collecting. *Tithe ‚Äì A tax to church. *Aide ‚Äì A tax on wine. *Vingti√®me ‚Äì 5 percent direct tax levied on income. *Capitation ‚Äì A poll tax.

For most authors, an algebraic equation is univariate, which means that it involves only one variable. On the other hand, a polynomial equation may involve several variables, in which case it is called multivariate and the term polynomial equation is usually preferred to algebraic equation. For example, :x^5-3x+1=0 is an algebraic equation with integer coefficients and :y^4+\\\\frac{xy}{2}=\\\\frac{x^3}{3}-xy^2+y^2-\\\\frac{1}{7} is a multivariate polynomial equation over the rationals. Some but not all polynomial equations with rational coefficients have a solution that is an algebraic expression that can be found using a finite number of operations that involve only those same types of coefficients (that is, can be solved algebraically). This can be done for all such equations of degree one, two, three, or four; but for degree five or more it can only be done for some equations, not for all. A large amount of research has been devoted to compute efficiently accurate approximations of the real or complex solutions of a univariate algebraic equation (see Root-finding algorithm) and of the common solutions of several multivariate polynomial equations (see System of polynomial equations).  History  The study of algebraic equations is probably as old as mathematics: the Babylonian mathematicians, as early as 2000 BC could solve some kinds of quadratic equations (displayed on Old Babylonian clay tablets). Univariate algebraic equations over the rationals (i.e., with rational coefficients) have a very long history. Ancient mathematicians wanted the solutions in the form of radical expressions, like x=\\\\frac{1+\\\\sqrt{5}}{2} for the positive solution of x^2-x-1=0. The ancient Egyptians knew how to solve equations of degree 2 in this manner. The Indian mathematician Brahmagupta (597‚Äì668 AD) explicitly described the quadratic formula in his treatise BrƒÅhmasphu·π≠asiddhƒÅnta published in 628 AD, but written in words instead of symbols. In the 9th century Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi and other Islamic mathematicians derived the quadratic formula, the general solution of equations of degree 2, and recognized the importance of the discriminant. During the Renaissance in 1545, Gerolamo Cardano published the solution of Scipione del Ferro and Niccol√≤ Fontana Tartaglia to equations of degree 3 and that of Lodovico Ferrari for equations of degree 4. Finally Niels Henrik Abel proved, in 1824, that equations of degree 5 and higher do not have general solutions using radicals. Galois theory, named after √âvariste Galois, showed that some equations of at least degree 5 do not even have an idiosyncratic solution in radicals, and gave criteria for deciding if an equation is in fact solvable using radicals.  Areas of study  The algebraic equations are the basis of a number of areas of modern mathematics: Algebraic number theory is the study of (univariate) algebraic equations over the rationals (that is, with rational coefficients). Galois theory was introduced by √âvariste Galois to specify criteria for deciding if an algebraic equation may be solved in terms of radicals. In field theory, an algebraic extension is an extension such that every element is a root of an algebraic equation over the base field. Transcendental number theory is the study of the real numbers which are not solutions to an algebraic equation over the rationals. A Diophantine equation is a (usually multivariate) polynomial equation with integer coefficients for which one is interested in the integer solutions. Algebraic geometry is the study of the solutions in an algebraically closed field of multivariate polynomial equations. Two equations are equivalent if they have the same set of solutions. In particular the equation P = Q is equivalent to P-Q = 0. It follows that the study of algebraic equations is equivalent to the study of polynomials. A polynomial equation over the rationals can always be converted to an equivalent one in which the coefficients are integers. For example, multiplying through by 42 = 2¬∑3¬∑7 and grouping its terms in the first member, the previously mentioned polynomial equation y^4+\\\\frac{xy}{2}=\\\\frac{x^3}{3}-xy^2+y^2-\\\\frac{1}{7} becomes :42y^4+21xy-14x^3+42xy^2-42y^2+6=0. Because sine, exponentiation, and 1/T are not polynomial functions, :e^T x^2+\\\\frac{1}{T}xy+\\\\sin(T)z -2 =0 is not a polynomial equation in the four variables x, y, z, and T over the rational numbers. However, it is a polynomial equation in the three variables x, y, and z over the field of the elementary functions in the variable T. Theory =Polynomials= Given an equation in unknown :(\\\\mathrm E) \\\\qquad a_n x^n + a_{n - 1} x^{n - 1} + \\\\dots + a_1 x + a_0 = 0, with coefficients in a field , one can equivalently say that the solutions of (E) in are the roots in of the polynomial :P = a_n X^n + a_{n - 1} X^{n - 1} + \\\\dots + a_1 X + a_0 \\\\quad \\\\in K[X]. It can be shown that a polynomial of degree in a field has at most roots. The equation (E) therefore has at most solutions. If is a field extension of , one may consider (E) to be an equation with coefficients in and the solutions of (E) in are also solutions in (the converse does not hold in general). It is always possible to find a field extension of known as the rupture field of the polynomial , in which (E) has at least one solution. = Existence of solutions to real and complex equations = The fundamental theorem of algebra states that the field of the complex numbers is closed algebraically, that is, all polynomial equations with complex coefficients and degree at least one have a solution. It follows that all polynomial equations of degree 1 or more with real coefficients have a complex solution. On the other hand, an equation such as x^2 + 1 = 0 does not have a solution in \\\\R (the solutions are the imaginary units and ). While the real solutions of real equations are intuitive (they are the -coordinates of the points where the curve intersects the -axis), the existence of complex solutions to real equations can be surprising and less easy to visualize. However, a monic polynomial of odd degree must necessarily have a real root. The associated polynomial function in is continuous, and it approaches -\\\\infty as approaches -\\\\infty and +\\\\infty as approaches +\\\\infty. By the intermediate value theorem, it must therefore assume the value zero at some real , which is then a solution of the polynomial equation. = Connection to Galois theory = There exist formulas giving the solutions of real or complex polynomials of degree less than or equal to four as a function of their coefficients. Abel showed that it is not possible to find such a formula in general (using only the four arithmetic operations and taking roots) for equations of degree five or higher. Galois theory provides a criterion which allows one to determine whether the solution to a given polynomial equation can be expressed using radicals.  Explicit solution of numerical equations  = Approach = The explicit solution of a real or complex equation of degree 1 is trivial. Solving an equation of higher degree reduces to factoring the associated polynomial, that is, rewriting (E) in the form :a_n(x-z_1)\\\\dots(x-z_n)=0, where the solutions are then the z_1, \\\\dots, z_n. The problem is then to express the z_i in terms of the a_i. This approach applies more generally if the coefficients and solutions belong to an integral domain. =General techniques= Factoring If an equation of degree has a rational root , the associated polynomial can be factored to give the form (by dividing by or by writing as a linear combination of terms of the form , and factoring out . Solving thus reduces to solving the degree equation . See for example the case . Elimination of the sub-dominant term To solve an equation of degree , :(\\\\mathrm E) \\\\qquad a_n x^n + a_{n - 1} x^{n - 1} + \\\\dots + a_1 x + a_0 = 0, a common preliminary step is to eliminate the degree- term: by setting x = y-\\\\frac{a_{n-1}}{n\\\\,a_n}, equation (E) becomes :a_ny^n + b_{n -2}y^{n -2} + \\\\dots +b_1 x +b_0 = 0. Leonhard Euler developed this technique for the case but it is also applicable to the case , for example. = Quadratic equations = To solve a quadratic equation of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0 one calculates the discriminant Œî defined by \\\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac. If the polynomial has real coefficients, it has: * two distinct real roots if \\\\Delta > 0 ; * one real double root if \\\\Delta = 0 ; * no real root if \\\\Delta < 0, but two complex conjugate roots. = Cubic equations = The best-known method for solving cubic equations, by writing roots in terms of radicals, is Cardano's formula. = Quartic equations = For detailed discussions of some solution methods see: * Tschirnhaus transformation (general method, not guaranteed to succeed); * Bezout method (general method, not guaranteed to succeed); * Ferrari method (solutions for degree 4); * Euler method (solutions for degree 4); * Lagrange method (solutions for degree 4); * Descartes method (solutions for degree 2 or 4); A quartic equation ax^4+bx^3+cx^2+dx+e=0 with a e0 may be reduced to a quadratic equation by a change of variable provided it is either biquadratic () or quasi-palindromic (). Some cubic and quartic equations can be solved using trigonometry or hyperbolic functions. = Higher-degree equations = √âvariste Galois and Niels Henrik Abel showed independently that in general a polynomial of degree 5 or higher is not solvable using radicals. Some particular equations do have solutions, such as those associated with the cyclotomic polynomials of degrees 5 and 17. Charles Hermite, on the other hand, showed that polynomials of degree 5 are solvable using elliptical functions. Otherwise, one may find numerical approximations to the roots using root-finding algorithms, such as Newton's method.

The Chicago Board of Trade Building in Chicago, Illinois is an iconic landmark of Chicago and the United States A National Historic Landmark (NHL) is a building, district, object, site, or structure that is officially recognized by the United States government for its outstanding historical significance. Only some 2,500 (~3%) of over 90,000 places listed on the country's National Register of Historic Places are recognized as National Historic Landmarks. A National Historic Landmark District may include contributing properties that are buildings, structures, sites or objects, and it may include non- contributing properties. Contributing properties may or may not also be separately listed. Creation of the program Prior to 1935, efforts to preserve cultural heritage of national importance were made by piecemeal efforts of the United States Congress. In 1935, Congress passed the Historic Sites Act, which authorized the Interior Secretary authority to formally record and organize historic properties, and to designate properties as having \\"national historical significance\\", and gave the National Park Service authority to administer historically significant federally owned properties.Robinson, Nicholas. Environmental Regulation of Real Property, Volume 1. New York: Law Journal Press, 1982. pp. 6:22‚Äì23. Over the following decades, surveys such as the Historic American Buildings Survey amassed information about culturally and architecturally significant properties in a program known as the Historic Sites Survey.Lee, Antoinette Josephine. The American Mosaic: Preserving a Nation's Heritage. Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1997. . p. 7 Most of the designations made under this legislation became National Historic Sites, although the first designation, made December 20, 1935, was for a National Memorial, the Gateway Arch National Park (then known as the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial) in St. Louis, Missouri. The first National Historic Site designation was made for the Salem Maritime National Historic Site on March 17, 1938.McDonnell, Janet; Mackintosh, Barry. The National Parks: Shaping the System. Washington, DC: Government Printing Office, 2005. . p. 52 In 1960, the National Park Service took on the administration of the survey data gathered under this legislation, and the National Historic Landmark program began to take more formal shape.Frank, Karolin; Petersen, Patricia. Historic Preservation in the USA. Berlin: Springer, 2002. . p. 66 When the National Register of Historic Places was established in 1966, the National Historic Landmark program was encompassed within it, and rules and procedures for inclusion and designation were formalized. Because listings (either on the National Register, or as an NHL) often triggered local preservation laws, legislation in 1980 amended the listing procedures to require owner agreement to the designations.Robinson, p. 6:24 On October 9, 1960, 92 properties were announced as designated NHLs by Secretary of the Interior Fred A. Seaton. The first of these was a political nomination: the Sergeant Floyd Monument in Sioux City, Iowa was officially designated on June 30 of that year, but for various reasons, the public announcement of the first several NHLs was delayed. Criteria NHLs are designated by the United States Secretary of the Interior because they are: * Sites where events of national historical significance occurred; * Places where prominent persons lived or worked; * Icons of ideals that shaped the nation; * Outstanding examples of design or construction; * Places characterizing a way of life; or * Archeological sites able to yield information. Current NHLs More than 2,500 NHLs have been designated. Most, but not all, are in the United States. There are NHLs in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Three states (Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and New York) account for nearly 25 percent of the nation's NHLs. Three cities within these states (Boston, Philadelphia, and New York City) all separately have more NHLs than 40 of the 50 states. In fact, New York City alone has more NHLs than all but five states: Virginia, California, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and New York (the latter of which has the most NHLs of all 50 states). There are 74 NHLs in the District of Columbia. Some NHLs are in U.S. commonwealths and territories, associated states, and foreign states. There are 15 in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and other U.S. commonwealths and territories; five in U.S.-associated states such as Micronesia; and one in Morocco.The counts and locations of NHLs are described most accurately in List of National Historic Landmarks by state. This extends, and corrects errors from, the National Park Service's \\"National Historic Landmarks Survey List of National Historic Landmarks by State\\", also referenced. Over 100 ships or shipwrecks have been designated as NHLs. Other About half of the National Historic Landmarks are privately owned.National Historic Landmarks Update, National Park Service, October 2004 The National Historic Landmarks Program relies on suggestions for new designations from the National Park Service, which also assists in maintaining the landmarks.

His paper on this topic was published in 1987 in the proceedings of the ACM SIGGRAPH conference. The name \\"boid\\" corresponds to a shortened version of \\"bird-oid object\\", which refers to a bird-like object. Incidentally, \\"boid\\" is also a New York Metropolitan dialect pronunciation for \\"bird.\\" As with most artificial life simulations, Boids is an example of emergent behavior; that is, the complexity of Boids arises from the interaction of individual agents (the boids, in this case) adhering to a set of simple rules. The rules applied in the simplest Boids world are as follows: * separation: steer to avoid crowding local flockmates * alignment: steer towards the average heading of local flockmates * cohesion: steer to move towards the average position (center of mass) of local flockmates More complex rules can be added, such as obstacle avoidance and goal seeking. The basic model has been extended in several different ways since Reynolds proposed it. For instance, Delgado-Mata et al. extended the basic model to incorporate the effects of fear. Olfaction was used to transmit emotion between animals, through pheromones modelled as particles in a free expansion gas. Hartman and Benes introduced a complementary force to the alignment that they call the change of leadership. This steer defines the chance of the boid to become a leader and try to escape. The movement of Boids can be characterized as either chaotic (splitting groups and wild behaviour) or orderly. Unexpected behaviours, such as splitting flocks and reuniting after avoiding obstacles, can be considered emergent. The boids framework is often used in computer graphics, providing realistic-looking representations of flocks of birds and other creatures, such as schools of fish or herds of animals. It was for instance used in the 1998 video game Half-Life for the flying bird-like creatures seen at the end of the game on Xen, named \\"boid\\" in the game files. The Boids model can be used for direct control and stabilization of teams of simple Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV) or Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAV) in swarm robotics. For stabilization of heterogeneous UAV-UGV teams, the model was adapted for using onboard relative localization by Saska et al. At the time of proposal, Reynolds' approach represented a giant step forward compared to the traditional techniques used in computer animation for motion pictures. The first animation created with the model was Stanley and Stella in: Breaking the Ice (1987), followed by a feature film debut in Tim Burton's film Batman Returns (1992) with computer generated bat swarms and armies of penguins marching through the streets of Gotham City. The boids model has been used for other interesting applications. It has been applied to automatically program Internet multi-channel radio stations. It has also been used for visualizing information and for optimization tasks.

Following his retirement as a wrestler, he was the stable master of Kokonoe stable until the time of his death. Chiyonofuji was considered one of the greatest yokozuna of recent times, winning 31 y≈´sh≈ç or tournament championships, second at the time only to Taih≈ç. He was particularly remarkable for his longevity in sumo's top rank, which he held for a period of ten years from 1981 to 1991. Promoted at the age of twenty-six after winning his second championship, his performance improved with age, winning more tournaments in his thirties than any other wrestler and dominating the sport in the second half of the 1980s. He finally retired in May 1991, just short of his thirty-sixth birthday. This is in contrast to most recent yokozuna who have tended to retire around 30. During his 21-year professional career Chiyonofuji set records for most career victories (1045) and most wins in the top makuuchi division (807), earning an entry in the Guinness World Records. Both of these records were later broken by Kai≈ç. He won the Kyushu tournament, one of the six annual honbasho, a record eight consecutive years from 1981 until 1988, and also set the record for the longest postwar run of consecutive wins (53 bouts in 1988). That record stood for 22 years until Hakuh≈ç broke it with his 54th straight win in September 2010. In a sport where weight is often regarded as vital, Chiyonofuji was quite light at around . He relied on superior technique and muscle to defeat opponents. He was the lightest yokozuna since Tochinoumi in the 1960s. Upon his retirement he became an elder of the Japan Sumo Association and became the Kokonoe-oyakata the following year. Early life He was born in Fukushima, a town in the Matsumae District of Hokkaid≈ç, northern Japan. He was a son of a fisherman. At school he excelled in athletics events, particularly running. He was scouted at the age of 15 by the Kokonoe stable's head Chiyonoyama, who had served as the 41st yokozuna and was from the same Fukushima town. Chiyonoyama promised him a trip to Tokyo in an airplane, which excited the young Akimoto as he had never flown before.Sharnoff, p. 5 At the time of his debut he weighed just . Chiyonoyama died in 1977, at which time Kitanofuji, the 52nd yokozuna and also a Hokkaid≈ç native, took over the stable. Ring name His shikona (ring name) ÂçÉ‰ª£„ÅÆÂØåÂ£´ (Chiyonofuji) was formed from those of the two previous yokozuna from his stable, Chiyonoyama and Kitanofuji. ÂçÉ‰ª£ (Chiyo, thousand years) is a word used to mean forever. ÂØåÂ£´ (Fuji) is the same as that in ÂØåÂ£´Â±± (Mount Fuji). His nickname was \\"The Wolf\\" due to his ferocity and masculine facial features. Early career Chiyonofuji began his career in September 1970. He reached the second highest j≈´ry≈ç division in November 1974, and was promoted to the top makuuchi division in September 1975. However, he lasted for only one tournament before being demoted again, and recurring shoulder dislocation injuries led to him falling back to the unsalaried ranks. He finally won promotion back to the top division in January 1978. After he got a fighting spirit prize ('Kant≈ç-sh≈ç') in May, he reached komusubi (the fourth-highest rank) for the first time. During his early top division career he was often compared with another lightweight wrestler who was popular with sumo fans, Takanohana I. Takanohana had first come across Chiyonofuji whilst on a regional tour and encouraged him to give sumo a try. Later, he also advised Chiyonofuji to give up smoking, which helped him put on some extra weight.Sharnoff, p. 56 In 1979, due to his shoulder trouble, Chiyonofuji briefly fell to the second division, but he soon came back to the top division. Encouraged by his stablemaster, he began to rely not only on throwing techniques, which increased the risk of reinjuring his shoulders, but also on gaining ground quickly and forcing out his opponents. Showing much more consistency, he earned three kinboshi (i.e. defeated yokozuna in three regular matches) in total in March and July 1980 tournaments, where he also got technique prizes (Gin≈ç-sh≈ç). He fought again as a komusubi in May and September tournaments, in the latter of which he won 10 matches in the top division for the first time. He reached sekiwake (the third-highest rank), and stayed at this rank for only two tournament. As a sekiwake, he scored 11‚Äì4 in November, and in January 1981 he scored 14‚Äì1, losing only one regular match to dominating yokozuna Kitanoumi, and then defeated him in the subsequent playoff to win a top makuuchi division title for the first time. This earned him promotion to ≈çzeki, the second-highest rank. While making these speedy rises, he also got technique prizes in three consecutive tournaments to that in January, where he also received an outstanding performance prize (Shukun-sh≈ç). Also as an ≈çzeki he scored well in the following three tournaments to July 1981, where he again defeated Kitanoumi and won his second title. After this victory, he was promoted to yokozuna, the 58th in sumo history. Yokozuna Chiyonofuji had to pull out of his first tournament as a Yokozuna with an injury, but he returned to win the championship in November, defeating Asashio in a playoff. He later said that this victory was the foundation upon which he built his subsequent success as a yokozuna. He was to win the Kyushu tournament eight consecutive years from 1981 to 1988, a record dominance of any of the six honbasho. As his rival Kitanoumi went into a long slump, Chiyonofuji dominated sumo in 1982, winning four of the six tournaments. However, over the next two years, another yokozuna Takanosato, emerged to challenge him, and he also suffered a number of injury problems. He was restricted to just one championship in the nine tournaments held from May 1983 to September 1984. But Kitanoumi retired in January 1985, with the aging Takanosato following a year later, and Chiyonofuji resumed his dominance. In 1986 he won five out of the six tournaments held, the first time this had been done since Kitanoumi in 1978. Despite being older and lighter than nearly all his opponents, he dominated the sport throughout the 1980s. In 1988, he went on a winning streak of 53 bouts, the third longest in sumo history second to current yokozuna Hakuh≈ç's 63, and Futabayama's all-time record of 69. The sequence began on the 7th day of the May 1988 tournament with victory over Hananoumi and continued through the July and September 1988 tournaments, ending only on the final day of the November 1988 tournament when he was defeated by ≈ånokuni. Had he won that bout, he would have been the first wrestler ever to win three consecutive tournaments with 15‚Äì0 records. Nonetheless, his winning run was the best ever in the postwar period, surpassing the 45 bouts won by Taih≈ç in 1968 and 1969. In July 1989 he took his 28th championship in a playoff from his stablemate Hokutoumi, marking the first time ever that two yokozuna from the same stable had met in competition.Sharnoff, p. 62 In September 1989 Chiyonofuji surpassed ≈åshio's record of 964 career wins and became the first sumo wrestler to receive the People's Honour Award from the Japanese Prime Minister. In March 1990, he secured his 1000th win. A 32nd tournament title would have tied the record set by Taih≈ç in 1971, but his 31st championship in November 1990 proved to be his last. In the opening tournament of 1991, Chiyonofuji surpassed Kitanoumi's record of 804 top division wins but injured himself on the second day and had to withdraw. He returned in May, but he lost on the opening day of the tournament to the 18-year-old rising star and future yokozuna Takanohana K≈çji (then known as Takahanada). It was estimated that half of the Japanese population watched the match on TV. Coincidentally, Takahanada's father, Takanohana Kenshi, had retired in 1981 shortly after losing to Chiyonofuji. Chiyonofuji beat Itai on the next day, but this was to be his final win. After losing another match with Takat≈çriki on the third day, Chiyonofuji announced his own retirement, a few weeks short of his 36th birthday. Retirement from the ring In September 1989 while Chiyonofuji was still active, the Japan Sumo Association decided to proffer the special status of ichidai-toshiyori (one-generation sumo-elder using his ring name as his elder name) to him,Ichidai-toshiyori is offered in recognition of great achievements in sumo world. Those who attained this special status include the 48th Yokozuna Taih≈ç and the 55th Yokozuna Kitanoumi. on the database of kotobank.jp. Retrieved 14 January 2010. but he declined it because he intended to inherit another elder name. Following his retirement from the ring in May 1991, Chiyonofuji inherited the elder name of Jinmaku; then in 1992 he purchased the Kokonoe stable from Kitanofuji and the two exchanged their elder names (Jinmaku and Kokonoe). on the database of kotobank.jp. Retrieved 14 January 2010. on the database of kotobank.jp. Retrieved 14 January 2010. The purchase price of the stable was reported as being around 50 million yen, below the market rate for a stable. Under his leadership, the stable produced several top wrestlers including former ≈çzeki Chiyotaikai, former komusubi Chiyotenzan and former maegashira Chiyohakuh≈ç. As of March 2016, Kokonoe stable is one of the most successful stables in sumo in terms of quantity of sekitori, with four men (Chiyotairy≈´, Chiyomaru, Chiyonokuni, and Chiyootori) in the top division and two (Chiyoshoma and Chiyo-o) in j≈´ry≈ç. He also served for some years as a ringside judge. In February 2008, he joined the board of directors of the Japan Sumo Association, where he was responsible for organising the regional tours or jungy≈ç, but he had to resign in April 2011 after his wrestler Chiyohakuh≈ç admitted involvement in match-fixing and retired from sumo. He returned in the January 2012 elections as the Operations director (the second most senior position in the Association's hierarchy), but was unseated two years later. He chose not to run for a board position in the 2016 elections, citing a lack of support. On May 31, 2015, he marked his 60th birthday by performing the kanreki dohy≈ç-iri at the Ry≈çgoku Kokugikan, becoming the tenth former yokozuna to do so. Two active yokozuna were his attendants, with Hakuh≈ç the tachimochi and Harumafuji acting as tsuyuharai. Family Chiyonofuji announced his engagement shortly after his fifth tournament championship in May 1982. He had a son and three daughters. His second daughter, Kozue Akimoto, born in 1987, is a fashion model. His youngest daughter Ai died at the age of four months, shortly before the July tournament of 1989.Sharnoff, p. 95 Death Chiyonofuji had surgery for pancreatic cancer in July 2015, and was noticeably weak when speaking to reporters at the Aki basho in September of that year. Having reportedly told associates that the cancer had spread to his heart and lungs, he had been hospitalized since the fourth day of the Nagoya tournament in 2016. He died in Tokyo on July 31, 2016 at the age of 61.ÂÖÉÊ®™Á∂±ÂçÉ‰ª£„ÅÆÂØåÂ£´„ÅÆ‰πùÈáçË¶™Êñπ„ÅåÊ≠ªÂéª 61Ê≠≥ . yahoo.co.jp (July 31, 2016) The chairman of the Japan Sumo Association, former yokozuna Hokutoumi who was a stablemate and prot√©g√© of Chiyonofuji, was too grief-stricken to speak to the press in the immediate aftermath of Chiyonofuji's death. His former stablemaster, ex- yokozuna Kitanofuji, said that he was \\"blessed with a wonderful disciple.\\" Another former yokozuna, Takanohana, who hastened Chiyonofuji's retirement by defeating him in 1991, recalled his fear of Chiyonofuji's \\"metal body\\" when training with him. On August 2 the Sumo Association announced that a farewell ceremony for Chiyonofuji would be held at the entrance of the Ry≈çgoku Kokugikan on October 1. Fighting style Throughout his career, Chiyonofuji's trademark kimarite or technique was uwatenage, or overarm throw. He preferred a migi-yotsu, or left hand outside, right hand inside grip on his opponent's mawashi. His left hand outer grip was so effective that some commentators referred to it as his \\"death grip.\\" Uwatenage was his second most common winning technique at sekitori level after yorikiri, or force out. He was also well known for tsuridashi, or lift out. He had knowledge of a wide range of other techniques as well, employing 41 different kimarite in his career. In January 1987, he won with the very rare amiuchi, or fisherman's net casting throw, and joked to the press afterwards that it was appropriate for him as he was the son of a fisherman.Sharnoff Chiyonofuji's muscular physique, athleticism and dramatic throws made him the most successful and one of the most popular wrestlers of his day.

It was for one passenger protected by a high hood which separated them from the driver at his side and had a square body in a square frame with wheels as high as the vehicle. Hansom cab and driver in a movie set in 1903 London. A hansom cab, London, 1877 The hansom cabThe Hansom Cab was designed, patented and tested in Hinckley is a kind of horse-drawn carriage designed and patented in 1834 by Joseph Hansom, an architect from York. The vehicle was developed and tested by Hansom in Hinckley,Hinckely, the founding home of the Hansom Cab Leicestershire, England. Originally called the Hansom safety cab, it was designed to combine speed with safety, with a low centre of gravity for safe cornering. Hansom's original design was modified by John Chapman and several others to improve its practicability, but retained Hansom's name.Penelope Harris, The Architectural Achievement of Joseph Aloysius Hansom (1803-1882), Designer of the Hansom Cab, Birmingham Town Hall, and Churches of the Catholic Revival (The Edwin Mellen Press, 2010), pp. 86-91, 93.The life of Joseph Aloysius Hansom (1803-1882) Cab is a shortening of cabriolet, reflecting the design of the carriage. It replaced the hackney carriage as a vehicle for hire; with the introduction of clockwork mechanical taximeters to measure fares, the name became taxicab. Hansom cabs enjoyed immense popularity as they were fast, light enough to be pulled by a single horse (making the journey cheaper than travelling in a larger four-wheel coach) and were agile enough to steer around horse-drawn vehicles in the notorious traffic jams of nineteenth-century London. There were up to 7500 hansom cabs in use at the height of their popularity and they quickly spread to other cities in the United Kingdom and Ireland (such as Dublin), as well as continental European cities, particularly Paris, Berlin, and St Petersburg. The cab was introduced to other British Empire cities and to the United States during the late 19th century, being most commonly used in New York City.  Design  Drawing of a hansom cab, showing the light, fast and low-slung design The cab, a type of fly, sat two passengers (three if squeezed in) and a driver who sat on a sprung seat behind the vehicle. The passengers could give their instructions to the driver through a trap door near the rear of the roof. They could pay the driver through this hatch and he would then operate a lever to release the doors so they could alight. In some cabs, the driver could operate a device that balanced the cab and reduced strain on the horse. The passengers were protected from the elements by the cab, and by folding wooden doors that enclosed their feet and legs, protecting their clothes from splashing mud. Later versions also had an up-and-over glass window above the doors to complete the enclosure of the passengers. Additionally, a curved fender mounted forward of the doors protected passengers from the stones thrown up by the hooves of the horse.  Hansom Cab Company  The Sherlock Holmes Museum's hansom cab with Vasily Livanov The Hansom Cab Company was set up to provide transportation in New York City and Miami, New York, in May 1869. The business was located at 133 Water Street (Manhattan), at the offices of Duncan, Sherman & Company, which served as bankers to the firm. The enterprise was organized by Ed W. Brandon who became its president. Two orders for a fleet of cabs were sent to carriage makers in New York City. A fare of thirty cents for a single person was designated for distances up to one mile, and forty cents for two people. A rate of seventy- five cents was determined for one or two persons for a length of time not exceeding one hour.The Hansom Cab Company, New York Times, May 27, 1869, p. 5. The cabs were widely used in the United Kingdom until 1908 when Taximeter Cars (petrol cabs) started to be introduced and were rapidly accepted; by the early 1920s horse-drawn cabs had largely been superseded by motor vehicles. The last licence for a horse-drawn cab in London was relinquished in 1947.Gregory Drodz, Cab and Coach, p. 26 A restored hansom cab once owned by Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt is on display at the Remington Carriage Museum in Cardston, Alberta, Canada. There is another surviving example, owned and operated by the Sherlock Holmes Museum in London; in common with other horse-drawn vehicles it is not permitted to enter any of the Royal Parks.Correspondence between the Sherlock Holmes Museum and James Purnell MP The Secretary of State for Culture Media and Sport Hinckley and Bosworth Borough Council, Leicestershire also have a restored Hansom cab [2].

Neats consider that solutions should be elegant, clear and provably correct. Scruffies believe that intelligence is too complicated (or computationally intractable) to be solved with the sorts of homogeneous system such neat requirements usually mandate. Much success in AI came from combining neat and scruffy approaches. For example, there are many cognitive models matching human psychological data built in Soar and ACT-R. Both of these systems have formal representations and execution systems, but the rules put into the systems to create the models are generated ad hoc. History The distinction was originally made by Roger Schank in the mid-1970s to characterize the difference between his work on natural language processing (which represented commonsense knowledge in the form of large amorphous semantic networks) from the work of John McCarthy, Allen Newell, Herbert A. Simon, Robert Kowalski and others whose work was based on logic and formal extensions of logic. Roger Schank actually notes that he originally made this distinction in linguistics, related to Chomskian vs. non-Chomskian, but discovered it works in AI too, and other areas. The distinction was also partly geographical and cultural: \\"scruffy\\" was associated with AI research at MIT under Marvin Minsky in the 1960s. The laboratory was famously \\"freewheeling\\" and researchers often developed AI programs by spending long hours tweaking programs until they showed the required behavior. This practice was named \\"hacking\\" and the laboratory gave birth to the hacker culture. Important and influential \\"scruffy\\" programs developed at MIT included Joseph Weizenbaum'sWeizenbaum would become a critic of AI, and would specifically single out the practice of \\"hacking\\" as \\"pathological\\". ELIZA, which behaved as if it spoke English, without any formal knowledge at all, and Terry Winograd'sWinograd also became a critic of early approaches to AI as well, arguing that intelligent machines could not be built using formal symbols exclusively, but required embodied cognition. SHRDLU, which could successfully answer queries and carry out actions in a simplified world consisting of blocks and a robot arm., , SHRDLU, while enormously successful, could not be scaled up into a useful natural language processing system, however, because it had no overarching design and maintaining a larger version of the program proved to be impossible; it was too scruffy to be extended. Other AI laboratories (of which the largest were Stanford, Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Edinburgh) focused on logic and formal problem solving as a basis for AI. These institutions supported the work of John McCarthy, Herbert A. Simon, Allen Newell, Donald Michie, Robert Kowalski, and many other \\"neats\\". The contrast between MIT's approach and other laboratories was also described as a \\"procedural/declarative distinction\\". Programs like SHRDLU were designed as agents that carried out actions; they executed \\"procedures\\". Other programs were designed as inference engines that manipulated formal statements (or \\"declarations\\") about the world and translated these manipulations into actions. The debate reached its peak in the middle 1980s. Nils Nilsson in his presidential address to Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence in 1983, discussed the issue, arguing that \\"the field needed both\\". He wrote \\"much of the knowledge we want our programs to have can and should be represented declaratively in some kind of declarative, logic like formalism. Ad hoc structures have their place, but most of these come from the domain itself.\\"Nils Nilsson, presidential address to AAAI in 1983 quoted in Alex P. Pentland and Martin Fischler of MIT argued in response that \\"There is no question that deduction and logic-like formalisms will play an important role in AI research; however, it does not seem that they are up to the Royal role that Nils suggests. This pretender King, while not naked, appears to have a limited wardrobe.\\"Pentland and Fischler 1983, quoted in Many other researchers also weighed in on one side or the other of the issue. The scruffy approach was applied to robotics by Rodney Brooks in the middle 1980s. He advocated building robots that were, as he put it, Fast, Cheap and Out of Control (the title of a 1989 paper co- authored with Anita Flynn). Unlike earlier robots such as Shakey or the Stanford cart, they did not build up representations of the world by analyzing visual information with algorithms drawn from mathematical machine learning techniques, and they did not plan their actions using formalizations based on logic, such as the 'Planner' language. They simply reacted to their sensors in a way that tended to help them survive and move. Doug Lenat's Cyc project, one of the oldest and most ambitious projects to capture all of human knowledge in machine readable form, is \\"a determinedly scruffy enterprise\\" (according to Pamela McCorduck). The Cyc database contains millions of facts about all the complexities of the world, each of which must be entered one at a time, by knowledge engineers. Each of these entries is an ad hoc addition to the intelligence of the system. While there may be a \\"neat\\" solution to the problem of commonsense knowledge (such as machine learning algorithms with natural language processing that could study the text available over the internet), no such project has yet been successful. New statistical and mathematical approaches to AI were developed in the 1990s, using highly developed formalisms such as Bayesian nets and mathematical optimization. This general trend towards more formal methods in AI is described as \\"the victory of the neats\\" by Peter Norvig and Stuart Russell. Pamela McCorduck, in 2004: \\"As I write, AI enjoys a Neat hegemony, people who believe that machine intelligence, at least, is best expressed in logical, even mathematical terms.\\" Neat solutions have been highly successful in the 21st century and are now used throughout the technology industry. These solutions, however, have mostly been applied to specific problems with specific solutions, and the problem of general intelligence remains unsolved. The terms \\"neat\\" and \\"scruffy\\" are rarely used by AI researchers in the 21st century, although the issue remains unresolved. The terms are commonly used in talks by Karl Friston on the Free energy principle, where he refers to Physicists as \\"Neats\\" and AI researchers as \\"Scruffies\\" (and Philosophers as \\"Mystics\\"). \\"Neat\\" solutions to problems such as machine learning and computer vision, have become indispensable throughout the technology industry, but ad-hoc and detailed solutions still dominate research into robotics and commonsense knowledge. Typical methodologies As might be guessed from the terms, neats use formal methods - such as logic or pure applied statistics - exclusively. Scruffies are hackers, who will cobble together a system built of anything - even logic. Neats care whether their reasoning is both provably sound and complete and that their machine learning systems can be shown to converge in a known length of time. Scruffies would like their learning to converge too, but they are happier if empirical experience shows their systems working than to have mere equations and proofs showing that they ought to. To a neat, scruffy methods appear promiscuous, successful only by accident and unlikely to produce insights about how intelligence actually works. To a scruffy, neat methods appear to be hung up on formalism and to be too slow, fragile or boring to be applied to real systems. Relation to philosophy and human intelligence This conflict goes much deeper than computer programming practices, (though it clearly has parallels in software engineering). For philosophical or possibly scientific reasons, some people believe that intelligence is fundamentally rational, and can best be represented by logical systems incorporating truth maintenance. Others believe that intelligence is best implemented as a mass of learned or evolved hacks, not necessarily having internal consistency or any unifying organizational framework. The apparently scruffy philosophy may also turn out to be provably (under typical assumptions) optimal for many applications. Intelligence is often seen as a form of search, and as such not believed to be perfectly solvable in a reasonable amount of time (see also NP and Simple Heuristics, commonsense reasoning, memetics, reactive planning). It is an open question whether human intelligence is inherently scruffy or neat. Some claim that the question itself is unimportant: the famously neat John McCarthy said publicly he had no interest in how human intelligence worked, while famous scruffy Rodney Brooks is openly obsessed with creating humanoid intelligence.

The card can be used interchangeably with JR West's ICOCA in the Kansai region and San'y≈ç region in Okayama, Hiroshima, and Yamaguchi prefectures, and also with JR Central's TOICA starting from spring of 2008, JR Kyushu's SUGOCA, Nishitetsu's Nimoca, and Fukuoka City Subway's Hayakaken area in Fukuoka City and its suburb areas, starting from spring of 2010. The card is also increasingly being accepted as a form of electronic money for purchases at stores and kiosks, especially within train stations. As of 2018, JR East reports 69.4 million Suica UID's have been issued, usable at 476,300 point of sale locations, with 6.6 million daily transactions. Since Suica is completely interchangeable with Pasmo (see Interoperation for the complete listing of companies and lines that accept Suica) in the greater Tokyo area, it is supported on virtually any train, tramway, and bus system (excluding various limited and shinkansen trains, as well as a few local buses as the system is still in the process of being extended to all routes). Etymology Suica stands for \\"Super Urban Intelligent CArd\\", and the pronunciation is also a pun on the Japanese word for watermelon, . In the logo, the \\"ic\\" is highlighted, standing for the initialism of integrated circuit in \\"IC card\\", which in turn is common Japanese vernacular for smart card. An additional meaning comes from the ideophone \\"sui sui\\" which means \\"to move smoothly\\", intended to highlight the smooth simplicity of using the card compared with traditional train tickets. Since penguins can also swim smoothly through water, a penguin is used as a motif. Uses While Suica's primary usage is as a fare card for transportation services, it can also be used as electronic money for general purchases. With the exception of archaic models of the Suica, all Suica have the 30px logo, which indicates that the card can be used as an electronic money in addition to train fare usage. Older cards without the logo can be replaced at no cost. As of 2004, JR East employees use the card as an employee ID card. Most vending machines, kiosks, and coin-operated lockers within JR stations can be paid with the card. In addition to payment, the card is also used as an electronic key to open the specific locker used. Outside of train stations, chain stores such as FamilyMart, ampm, 7-Eleven, Ministop, Circle K Sunkus, Yodobashi Camera and Bic Camera support transactions with Suica, however mostly restricted to the Kant≈ç region only. A few shops at Narita International Airport, and taxis accept Suica. Stores that accept Suica are indicated by displaying either a Suica, Pasmo, Kitaca, Icoca, Toica, Sugoca, Nimoca, or Hayakaken logo. The card can also be used to make payments at supporting online shops, which requires the consumer to own a Sony FeliCa Reader hardware and a PC running the Windows operating system. Functions and services Ticket gates at Ikebukuro Station: The center lane is exclusive for Suica, but other lanes also accept Suica. Kuzuoka, a station not equipped with regular ticket gates Keyless locker system for Suica and Pasmo in Shibuya Station NEC's LaVie notebook PC showing an integrated FeliCa Port to the right of the image, used for Internet payment with cards such as Suica and Pasmo Usage of the card involves scanning it at a card reader. The technology allows for the card to be read at some distance from the reader, so contact is not required. This functionality is in contrast to the instructions which frequently inform the user to the card to the reader, a misnomer since it works with or without physical contact. In fact, many people leave the card in their wallet and just pass the wallet over the reader as they enter the ticket gate. The balance on the card is displayed when the user enters the ticket gate this way. The minimum fare is needed on the card when entering the train system, which is not deducted at that time. The balance is also displayed whenever the card is inserted into ticket or fare adjustment machines. A travel record is stored on the card, and can be displayed or printed out at the same places where cards can be purchased and reloaded. On exit, the card is again scanned at a card reader. At this time the fare is deducted from the remaining balance from the card and the new balance is displayed. The card can also be used to store a commuter pass. This is available for purchase from regular ticket machines and allows a Monthly, 3-monthly or Annual pass for travel between two JR stations to be stored on the card. On occasion, when traveling to a station where Suica is not supported, the card must be handed over to the staff at the exiting station, so that they can calculate the remaining fare and return a slip of paper which must be given to the staff at the next station where Suica is used. Since the system keeps track of when a card enters and leaves a station, if the records show that the card had entered a station but not left (due to the situation such as described above, or technical malfunctions), the station staff can reset the card. Points of purchase These cards are available at card vending machines at the train stations that allows Suica. A new card costs 2,000 yen, which includes a 500 yen deposit that will be refunded if the card is returned. The remaining 1,500 yen is immediately available for train rides, and more money can be charged on to the card (in 500 yen, 1,000 yen, 2,000 yen, 3,000 yen, 4,000 yen, 5,000 yen, and 10,000 yen increments), up to a card maximum of 20,000 yen, at similar ticket vending machines or fare adjustment machines displaying the Suica logo inside each station. Types of cards Suica are sold by JR East and two of its subsidiaries: *Suica, MySuica, Welcome Suica and View Suica: sold by JR East *Rinkai Suica: sold by Tokyo Waterfront Area Rapid Transit (Rinkai Line) *Monorail Suica: sold by Tokyo Monorail A Suica works as the standard prepaid Suica (with user's name available on it) which can be used to ride trains in the place of paper tickets, or it can become the Suica commuter pass for unlimited traveling between two destinations for work or school. The Suica commuter pass also doubles as a prepaid Suica for purchases or tickets outside of the normal commute route. =Credit card integrations= The VIEW Suica pairs the prepaid Suica with a credit card. Various types exist, including at least one available through JR and View, and others such as the Bic Camera Suica. These function both as a pre-paid Suica as well as a regular credit card, and provide an auto-charge feature to prevent exhausting the Suica balance unintentionally. The automatically recharged amount is added to the user's credit card bill. Thus, these cards have two balances: a prepaid Suica balance and a credit balance for which monthly bills are sent. Thus, store-related cards like the Bic Suica can include fully three separate functions: serving as a store point card, a general use Suica, and as a credit card. Any credit purchase (restricted, in the case of Bic, to JCB) adds a small amount to the available points on the store point card. Yet another type of Suica offered by Japan Airlines (JAL) that is called JALCARD Suica. In addition to having Suica and credit card functionalities, a JALCARD Suica can also function as an electronic boarding pass for a JAL-operated domestic flight in Japan at an airport that offers the JAL IC service. =MySuica= MySuica allows users to input personal information at the time the card is created. If the card is later lost or stolen, the user can obtain a new card with the previous balance. =Welcome Suica= In August 2019, JR East unveiled Welcome Suica, a Suica variant designed for use by tourists to Japan. Its design features white cherry blossoms on a red background. Welcome Suica is also reloadable, but unlike regular Suica cards, Welcome Suica does not require the user to make a deposit. However, Welcome Suica can only be used for 28 days from the date of purchase after which it stops working. It is also nonrefundable, regardless of the balance or user's activity. JR East request customers always carry with them a reference sheet, or receipt, to accompany the card. Card stacking Ticket gates return an error when the scan encounters more than one compatible card. Although it is intended that each person have only one Suica, many people have more than one. Further, since the introduction of Pasmo in March 2007, more people have at least one of each. Consequently, JR has begun, and intensified since March, an awareness campaign to discourage commuters from storing multiple cards together. Incompatible cards, such as Edy, seem to have an inconsistent effect on a machine's ability to read the card which may depend on the reading device. On the other hand, the Express-IC (EX-IC) card for Tokaido Shinkansen reservations is meant to be used in this manner (stacked on either a Suica or ICOCA to facilitate transfer between Shinkansen and regular lines). Technology The card incorporates contactless Near Field Communication (NFC) technology developed by Sony, called FeliCa. The same technology is also deployed in the Edy electronic cash cards used in Japan, the Octopus card in Hong Kong, and the EZ-Link Card in Singapore. Interoperation Interoperation map (as of March 17, 2018) On March 18, 2007, the Tokyo-area private railways, bus companies, and subways implemented Pasmo, a smart card solution to replace the existing Passnet magnetic card system. Through collaboration with JR East, passengers can use Suica wherever Pasmo cards are accepted to ride any railway or bus in the Tokyo metropolitan area. Monthly passes for JR East lines can only be on Suica, while monthly passes for Tokyo Metro can only be on Pasmo cards but otherwise, the cards are functionally identical for commuters. This agreement has since been implemented with other systems across Japan. On March 23, 2013, a nationwide inter-operation among 10 transportation smart cards started. As of 2014 Suica has interoperability with ICOCA, Kitaca, PASMO, TOICA, manaca, PiTaPa, SUGOCA, nimoca, hayakaken and several other local smart cards. Since July 22, 2014, Suica can be used to pay for Wii U Nintendo eShop digital video games with the NFC function of the Wii U GamePad. Mobile Suica Since January 2006, a version called Mobile Suica has been incorporated into mobile FeliCa wallet phones by Japan's mobile operators. This system includes Java applications to manage the Suica function in the mobile phone, to recharge the Suica stored in the mobile phone, review the stored value and perform other functions via the mobile phone. An enhancement for 2007 will allow for Suica charges to be added directly to the phone bill, eliminating the requirement to constantly add to and monitor the remaining balance. On May 23, 2011, JR announced debut of Mobile Suica app for Android Smartphones supporting Osaifu- Keitai. = Apple Pay = On September 7, 2016, Apple announced that Suica cards could be added to Apple Pay in the Wallet app and used in the same way as a physical card. This functionality was limited to devices purchased in Japan which included FeliCa support: iPhone 7 (model A1779 and A1785) and Apple Watch Series 2. With the release of the iPhone 8, iPhone X and the Apple Watch Series 3, devices purchased anywhere can be used with Apple Pay Suica providing the user changes the device region to Japan. iOS 13 introduced support for creating a virtual Suica card from the Wallet app. Alternatively, users can download the Suica app or English language SuicaEng app from the App Store to create a virtual Suica card. = Google Pay = On May 24, 2018, Google announced that Suica cards could be added to Google Pay. This functionality is limited to Android devices that are purchased in Japan that support Osaifu-Keitai and have their Google Account's region set to Japan.

The paper, published in 1950 in Mind, was the first to introduce his concept of what is now known as the Turing test to the general public. Turing's paper considers the question \\"Can machines think?\\" Since the words \\"think\\" and \\"machine\\" cannot be defined in a clear way that satisfies everyone, Turing suggests we \\"replace the question by another, which is closely related to it and is expressed in relatively unambiguous words.\\" To do this, he must first find a simple and unambiguous idea to replace the word \\"think\\", second he must explain exactly which \\"machines\\" he is considering, and finally, armed with these tools, he formulates a new question, related to the first, that he believes he can answer in the affirmative. Turing's test The \\"standard interpretation\\" of the Turing Test, in which the interrogator is tasked with trying to determine which player is a computer and which is a human Rather than trying to determine if a machine is thinking, Turing suggests we should ask if the machine can win a game, called the \\"Imitation Game\\". The original Imitation game that Turing described is a simple party game involving three players. Player A is a man, player B is a woman and player C (who plays the role of the interrogator) can be of either sex. In the Imitation Game, player C is unable to see either player A or player B (and knows them only as X and Y), and can communicate with them only through written notes or any other form that does not give away any details about their gender. By asking questions of player A and player B, player C tries to determine which of the two is the man and which is the woman. Player A's role is to trick the interrogator into making the wrong decision, while player B attempts to assist the interrogator in making the right one. Turing proposes a variation of this game that involves the computer: What will happen when a machine takes the part of A in this game?\\" Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman? These questions replace our original, 'Can machines think? So the modified game becomes one that involves three participants in isolated rooms: a computer (which is being tested), a human, and a (human) judge. The human judge can converse with both the human and the computer by typing into a terminal. Both the computer and human try to convince the judge that they are the human. If the judge cannot consistently tell which is which, then the computer wins the game.This describes the simplest version of the test. For a more detailed discussion, see Versions of the Turing test. As Stevan Harnad notes, the question has become \\"Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?\\" In other words, Turing is no longer asking whether a machine can \\"think\\"; he is asking whether a machine can act indistinguishably from the way a thinker acts. This question avoids the difficult philosophical problem of pre-defining the verb \\"to think\\" and focuses instead on the performance capacities that being able to think makes possible, and how a causal system can generate them. Some have taken Turing's question to have been \\"Can a computer, communicating over a teleprinter, fool a person into believing it is human?\\"Wardrip-Fruin, Noah and Nick Montfort, ed (2003). The New Media Reader. The MIT Press. . but it seems clear that Turing was not talking about fooling people but about generating human cognitive capacity. Digital machines Turing also notes that we need to determine which \\"machines\\" we wish to consider. He points out that a human clone, while man-made, would not provide a very interesting example. Turing suggested that we should focus on the capabilities of digital machinery‚Äîmachines which manipulate the binary digits of 1 and 0, rewriting them into memory using simple rules. He gave two reasons. First, there is no reason to speculate whether or not they can exist. They already did in 1950. Second, digital machinery is \\"universal\\". Turing's research into the foundations of computation had proved that a digital computer can, in theory, simulate the behaviour of any other digital machine, given enough memory and time. (This is the essential insight of the Church‚ÄìTuring thesis and the universal Turing machine.) Therefore, if any digital machine can \\"act like it is thinking\\" then, every sufficiently powerful digital machine can. Turing writes, \\"all digital computers are in a sense equivalent.\\" This allows the original question to be made even more specific. Turing now restates the original question as \\"Let us fix our attention on one particular digital computer C. Is it true that by modifying this computer to have an adequate storage, suitably increasing its speed of action, and providing it with an appropriate programme, C can be made to play satisfactorily the part of A in the imitation game, the part of B being taken by a man?\\" Hence Turing states that the focus is not on \\"whether all digital computers would do well in the game nor whether the computers that are presently available would do well, but whether there are imaginable computers which would do well\\". What is more important is to consider the advancements possible in the state of our machines today regardless of whether we have the available resource to create one or not. Nine common objections Having clarified the question, Turing turned to answering it: he considered the following nine common objections, which include all the major arguments against artificial intelligence raised in the years since his paper was first published. and see where comment \\"Turing examined a wide variety of possible objections to the possibility of intelligent machines, including virtually all of those that have been raised in the half century since his paper appeared.\\" #Religious Objection: This states that thinking is a function of man's immortal soul; therefore, a machine cannot think. \\"In attempting to construct such machines,\\" wrote Turing, \\"we should not be irreverently usurping His power of creating souls, any more than we are in the procreation of children: rather we are, in either case, instruments of His will providing mansions for the souls that He creates.\\" # 'Heads in the Sand' Objection: \\"The consequences of machines thinking would be too dreadful. Let us hope and believe that they cannot do so.\\" This thinking is popular among intellectual people, as they believe superiority derives from higher intelligence and the possibility of being overtaken is a threat (as machines have efficient memory capacities and processing speed, machines exceeding the learning and knowledge capabilities are highly probable). This objection is a fallacious appeal to consequences, confusing what should not be with what can or cannot be (Wardrip-Fruin, 56). #Mathematical Objections: This objection uses mathematical theorems, such as G√∂del's incompleteness theorem, to show that there are limits to what questions a computer system based on logic can answer. Turing suggests that humans are too often wrong themselves and pleased at the fallibility of a machine. (This argument would be made again by philosopher John Lucas in 1961 and physicist Roger Penrose in 1989.), , and . Russell and Norvig identify Lucas and Penrose's arguments as being the same one answered by Turing. #Argument From Consciousness: This argument, suggested by Professor Geoffrey Jefferson in his 1949 Lister Oration states that \\"not until a machine can write a sonnet or compose a concerto because of thoughts and emotions felt, and not by the chance fall of symbols, could we agree that machine equals brain.\\"\\"The Mind of Mechanical Man\\" Turing replies by saying that we have no way of knowing that any individual other than ourselves experiences emotions, and that therefore we should accept the test. He adds, \\"I do not wish to give the impression that I think there is no mystery about consciousness ... [b]ut I do not think these mysteries necessarily need to be solved before we can answer the question [of whether machines can think].\\" (This argument, that a computer can't have conscious experiences or understanding, would be made in 1980 by philosopher John Searle in his Chinese room argument. Turing's reply is now known as the \\"other minds reply\\". See also Can a machine have a mind? in the philosophy of AI.) and , who identify Searle's argument with the one Turing answers. #Arguments from various disabilities. These arguments all have the form \\"a computer will never do X\\". Turing offers a selection: > Be kind, resourceful, beautiful, friendly, have initiative, have a sense of > humour, tell right from wrong, make mistakes, fall in love, enjoy > strawberries and cream, make someone fall in love with it, learn from > experience, use words properly, be the subject of its own thought, have as > much diversity of behaviour as a man, do something really new. Turing notes that \\"no support is usually offered for these statements,\\" and that they depend on naive assumptions about how versatile machines may be in the future, or are \\"disguised forms of the argument from consciousness.\\" He chooses to answer a few of them: ##Machines cannot make mistakes. He notes it's easy to program a machine to appear to make a mistake. ##A machine cannot be the subject of its own thought (or can't be self-aware). A program which can report on its internal states and processes, in the simple sense of a debugger program, can certainly be written. Turing asserts \\"a machine can undoubtably be its own subject matter.\\" ##A machine cannot have much diversity of behaviour. He notes that, with enough storage capacity, a computer can behave in an astronomical number of different ways. #Lady Lovelace's Objection: One of the most famous objections states that computers are incapable of originality. This is largely because, according to Ada Lovelace, machines are incapable of independent learning. > The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything. It > can do whatever we know how to order it to perform. It can follow analysis; > but it has no power of anticipating any analytical relations or truths. Turing suggests that Lovelace's objection can be reduced to the assertion that computers \\"can never take us by surprise\\" and argues that, to the contrary, computers could still surprise humans, in particular where the consequences of different facts are not immediately recognizable. Turing also argues that Lady Lovelace was hampered by the context from which she wrote, and if exposed to more contemporary scientific knowledge, it would become evident that the brain's storage is quite similar to that of a computer. #Argument from continuity in the nervous system: Modern neurological research has shown that the brain is not digital. Even though neurons fire in an all-or-nothing pulse, both the exact timing of the pulse and the probability of the pulse occurring have analog components. Turing acknowledges this, but argues that any analog system can be simulated to a reasonable degree of accuracy given enough computing power. (Philosopher Hubert Dreyfus would make this argument against \\"the biological assumption\\" in 1972.) #Argument from the informality of behaviour: This argument states that any system governed by laws will be predictable and therefore not truly intelligent. Turing replies by stating that this is confusing laws of behaviour with general rules of conduct, and that if on a broad enough scale (such as is evident in man) machine behaviour would become increasingly difficult to predict. He argues that, just because we can't immediately see what the laws are, does not mean that no such laws exist. He writes \\"we certainly know of no circumstances under which we could say, 'we have searched enough. There are no such laws.'\\". (Hubert Dreyfus would argue in 1972 that human reason and problem solving was not based on formal rules, but instead relied on instincts and awareness that would never be captured in rules. More recent AI research in robotics and computational intelligence attempts to find the complex rules that govern our \\"informal\\" and unconscious skills of perception, mobility and pattern matching. See Dreyfus' critique of AI)., , and , who identify Dreyfus' argument with the one Turing answers. This rejoinder also includes the Turing's Wager argument. #Extra- sensory perception: In 1950, extra-sensory perception was an active area of research and Turing chooses to give ESP the benefit of the doubt, arguing that conditions could be created in which mind-reading would not affect the test. Learning machines In the final section of the paper Turing details his thoughts about the Learning Machine that could play the imitation game successfully. Here Turing first returns to Lady Lovelace's objection that the machine can only do what we tell it to do and he likens it to a situation where a man \\"injects\\" an idea into the machine to which the machine responds and then falls off into quiescence. He extends on this thought by an analogy to an atomic pile of less than critical size which is to be considered the machine and an injected idea is to correspond to a neutron entering the pile from outside the pile; the neutron will cause a certain disturbance which eventually dies away. Turing then builds on that analogy and mentions that if the size of the pile were to be sufficiently large then a neutron entering the pile would cause a disturbance that would continue to increase until the whole pile were destroyed, the pile would be supercritical. Turing then asks the question as to whether this analogy of a super critical pile could be extended to a human mind and then to a machine. He concludes that such an analogy would indeed be suitable for the human mind with \\"There does seem to be one for the human mind. The majority of them seem to be \\"subcritical,\\" i.e., to correspond in this analogy to piles of sub critical size. An idea presented to such a mind will on average give rise to less than one idea in reply. A smallish proportion are supercritical. An idea presented to such a mind that may give rise to a whole \\"theory\\" consisting of secondary, tertiary and more remote ideas\\". He finally asks if a machine could be made to be supercritical. Turing then mentions that the task of being able to create a machine that could play the imitation game is one of programming and he postulates that by the end of the century it will indeed be technologically possible to program a machine to play the game. He then mentions that in the process of trying to imitate an adult human mind it becomes important to consider the processes that lead to the adult mind being in its present state; which he summarizes as: ::1. The initial state of the mind, say at birth, ::2. The education to which it has been subjected, ::3. Other experience, not to be described as education, to which it has been subjected. Given this process he asks whether it would be more appropriate to program a child's mind instead of an adults mind and then subject the child mind to a period of education. He likens the child to a newly bought notebook and speculates that due to its simplicity it would be more easily programmed. The problem then is broken down into two parts, the programming of a child mind and its education process. He mentions that a child mind would not be expected as desired by the experimenter (programmer) at the first attempt. A learning process that involves a method of reward and punishment must be in place that will select desirable patterns in the mind. This whole process, Turing mentions, to a large extent is similar to that of evolution by natural selection where the similarities are: ::Structure of the child machine = hereditary material ::Changes of the child machine = mutations ::Natural selection = judgment of the experimenter Following this discussion Turing addresses certain specific aspects of the learning machine: :* Nature of inherent complexity: The child machine could either be one that is as simple as possible, merely maintaining consistency with general principles, or the machine could be one with a complete system of logical inference programmed into it. This more complex system is explained by Turing as \\"..would be such that the machines store would be largely occupied with definitions and propositions. The propositions would have various kinds of status, e.g., well-established facts, conjectures, mathematically proved theorems, statements given by an authority, expressions having the logical form of proposition but not belief-value. Certain propositions may be described as \\"imperatives.\\" The machine should be so constructed that as soon as an imperative is classed as \\"well established\\" the appropriate action automatically takes place.\\". Despite this built-in logic system the logical inference programmed in would not be one that is formal, rather it would be one that is more pragmatic. In addition the machine would build on its built- in logic system by a method of \\"scientific induction\\". :* Ignorance of the experimenter: An important feature of a learning machine that Turing points out is the ignorance of the teacher of the machines' internal state during the learning process. This is in contrast to a conventional discrete state machine where the objective is to have a clear understanding of the internal state of the machine at every moment during the computation. The machine will be seen to be doing things that we often cannot make sense of or something that we consider to be completely random. Turing mentions that this specific character bestows upon a machine a certain degree of what we consider to be intelligence, in that intelligent behaviour consists of a deviation from the complete determinism of conventional computation but only so long as the deviation does not give rise to pointless loops or random behaviour. :* The importance of random behaviour: Though Turing cautions us of random behaviour he mentions that inculcating an element of randomness in a learning machine would be of value in a system. He mentions that this could be of value where there might be multiple correct answers or ones where it might be such that a systematic approach would investigate several unsatisfactory solutions to a problem before finding the optimal solution which would entail the systematic process inefficient. Turing also mentions that the process of evolution takes the path of random mutations in order to find solutions that benefit an organism but he also admits that in the case of evolution the systematic method of finding a solution would not be possible. Turing concludes by speculating about a time when machines will compete with humans on numerous intellectual tasks and suggests tasks that could be used to make that start. Turing then suggests that abstract tasks such as playing chess could be a good place to start another method which he puts as \\"..it is best to provide the machine with the best sense organs that money can buy, and then teach it to understand and speak English.\\". An examination of the development in artificial intelligence that has followed reveals that the learning machine did take the abstract path suggested by Turing as in the case of Deep Blue, a chess playing computer developed by IBM and one which defeated the world champion Garry Kasparov (though, this too is controversial) and the numerous computer chess games which can outplay most amateurs. As for the second suggestion Turing makes, it has been likened by some authors as a call to finding a simulacrum of human cognitive development. And such attempts at finding the underlying algorithms by which children learn of the features of the world around them are only beginning to be made. Notes References  . * . * .

More formally, a circular segment is a region of two-dimensional space that is bounded by an arc (of less than 180¬∞) of a circle and by the chord connecting the endpoints of the arc.  Formula  A circular segment (in green) is enclosed between a secant/chord (the dashed line) and the arc whose endpoints equal the chord's (the arc shown above the green area). Let R be the radius of the circle, Œ∏ the central angle in radians, Œ± is the central angle in degrees, c the chord length, s the arc length, h the sagitta (height) of the segment, and d the height (or apothem) of the triangular portion. The radius is :R = h + d = \\\\frac{h}{2}+\\\\frac{c^2}{8h} The radius in terms of h and c can be derived above by using the Intersecting Chords Theorem, where 2R (the diameter) and c are perpendicularly intersecting chords: :(2R-h)\\\\cdot h = \\\\frac{c}{2}\\\\cdot\\\\frac{c}{2} = \\\\frac{c^2}{4} :2R = \\\\frac{c^2}{4h} + h :R = \\\\frac{c^2}{8h} + \\\\frac{h}{2} The arc length is :s = \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{180^\\\\circ}\\\\pi R = {\\\\theta} R = \\\\arcsin\\\\left(\\\\frac{c}{h+\\\\frac{c^2}{4h}}\\\\right)\\\\left(h + \\\\frac{c^2}{4h}\\\\right) The arc length in terms of arcsin can be derived above by considering an inscribed angle that subtends the same arc, and one side of the angle is a diameter.

Drinking culture is the set of traditions and social behaviors that surround the consumption of beverages containing ethanol as a recreational drug and social lubricant. Although alcoholic beverages and social attitudes toward drinking vary around the world, nearly every civilization has independently discovered the processes of brewing beer, fermenting wine and distilling spirits. Alcohol and its effects have been present in societies throughout history. Drinking is documented in the Hebrew and Christian Bibles, in the Qur'an, in art history, in Greek and Roman literature as old as Homer and in Confucius's Analects. Social drinking \\"Social drinking\\", also commonly referred to as \\"responsible drinking\\", refers to casual drinking of alcoholic beverages in a social setting without an intent to become intoxicated. In Western cultures, good news is often celebrated by a group of people having a few alcoholic drinks. For example, alcoholic drinks may be served to \\"wet the baby's head\\" in the celebration of a birth. Buying someone an alcoholic drink is often considered a gesture of goodwill. It may be an expression of gratitude, or it may mark the resolution of a dispute. =Drinking etiquette= Reunion of gentlemen around a table in an interior, by Jacob van Schuppen. For the purposes of buying rounds of alcoholic drinks in English public houses, William Greaves, a retired London journalist, devised a set of etiquette guidelines as a Saturday morning essay in the defunct Today newspaper. Known as Greaves' Rules, the guidelines were based upon his long experience of pubs and rounds. The rules were later recommissioned by the Daily Telegraph and published in that newspaper on November 20, 1993. Copies of the rules soon appeared in many bars throughout the United Kingdom. Kate Fox, a social anthropologist, came up with a similar idea in her book Watching the English, but concluded their rationale was the need to minimise the possibility of violence between drinking companions. When taking alcohol to a BYOB (bring your own bottle/booze/beer) party, it is proper for a guest to leave any unconsumed alcohol behind when leaving the party. It shows appreciation to the host and shows responsibility on the guest's part. It is considered rude to take any alcohol back when departing. Drinking at early times of the day is frowned upon in some cultures. Noon is often seen as earliest appropriate time of day to consume alcohol, especially on its own, although there are some exceptions such as drinking Buck's Fizzes on Christmas Day morning. Likewise, a mimosa or bloody mary with breakfast or brunch is common in many cultures. =Free drinks= Various cultures and traditions feature the social practice of providing free alcoholic drinks for others. For example, during a wedding reception or a bar mitzvah, free alcoholic drinks are often served to guests, a practice that is known as \\"an open bar\\". Free alcoholic drinks may also be offered to increase attendance at a social or business function. They are commonly offered to casino patrons to entice them to continue gambling. A further example is the \\"ladies drink free\\" policy of some bars, which is intended to attract more paying customers (i.e., men). Large corporations (especially in Japan) may have a favored bar at which they hold private functions that offer free alcoholic drinks to attendees. =Session drinking= Session drinking is a chiefly British and Irish term that refers to drinking a large quantity of beer during a \\"session\\" (i.e. a specific period of time) without becoming too heavily intoxicated. A session is generally a social occasion. A \\"session beer\\", such as a session bitter, is a beer that has a moderate or relatively low alcohol content. In the United States, a recent session beer definition has been proposed by beer writer Lew Bryson. His Session Beer Project blog includes a definition of 4.5% ABV or less for session beer. Followers of this definition include Notch Brewing, a session only beer brand. The Brewer Association has adopted a new category within their Great American Beer Fest competition which states a \\"session beer\\" must not exceed 4.1% ABW (5.1% ABV). In British vernacular, \\"session\\" is commonly referred to as \\"sesh\\". In Ireland, the term \\"pub session\\" refers to playing music in a pub. =Vertical drinking= Vertical drinking means that all or most of the patrons in an establishment are standing while drinking. This is linked to faster rates of consumption, and can lead to tension and possibly violence as patrons attempt to manoevre around each other.BBC News http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/lancashire/5240298.stm Binge drinking Binge drinking is defined as drinking to excess. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) defines binge drinking as a pattern of drinking alcohol that brings blood alcohol concentration (BAC) to 0.08 grams percent or above. For the typical adult, this pattern corresponds to consuming five or more drinks (men), or four or more drinks (women) in about 2 hours. The concept of a \\"binge\\" has been somewhat elastic over the years, implying consumption of alcohol far beyond that which is socially acceptable. In earlier decades, \\"going on a binge\\" meant drinking over the course of several days until one was no longer able to continue drinking. This usage is known to have entered the English language as late as 1854; it derives from an English dialectal word meaning to \\"soak\\" or to \\"fill a boat with water\\". (OED, American Heritage Dictionary) = Geographic disparity = Understanding drinking in young people should be done through a \\"developmental\\" framework. This would be referred to as a \\"whole system\\" approach to underage drinking, as it takes into account a particular adolescent's unique risk and protective factors‚Äîfrom genetics and personality characteristics to social and environmental factors. It is widely observed that in areas of Europe where children and adolescents routinely consume alcohol early and with parental approval, binge drinking tends to be less prevalent. Typically, a distinction is drawn between northern and southern Europe, with the northerners being the binge drinkers. The highest levels of both binge-drinking and drunkenness are found in the Nordic countries, UK, Ireland, Slovenia and Latvia [cite]. This contrasts with the low levels found in France, Italy, Lithuania, Poland and Romania ‚Äì for example, binge-drinking more than twice in the last month was reported by 31% of boys [ages?] and 33% of girls in Ireland, but in comparison 12‚Äì13% of boys and 5‚Äì7% of girls in France and Hungary. As early as the eighth century, Saint Boniface was writing to Cuthbert, Archbishop of Canterbury, to report how \\"In your diocese, the vice of drunkenness is too frequent. This is an evil peculiar to pagans and to our race. Neither the Franks nor the Gauls nor the Lombards nor the Romans nor the Greeks commit it\\". It is probable, however, that \\"the vice of drunkenness\\" was present in all European nations. The 16th-century Frenchman Rabelais wrote comedic and absurd satires illustrating his countrymen's drinking habits, and Saint Augustin used the example of a drunkard in Rome to illustrate certain spiritual principles. Some studies have noted traditional, cultural differences between Northern and Southern Europe. A difference in perception may also account to some extent for historically noted cultural differences: Northern Europeans drink beer, which in the past was often of a low alcohol content (2.5% compared to today's 5%). In pre-industrial society, beer was safer to drink than water, because it had been boiled and contained alcohol. Southern Europeans drink wine and fortified wines (10‚Äì20% alcohol by volume). Traditionally, wine was watered and honeyed; drinking full strength wine was considered barbaric in Republican Rome. Nor does binge drinking necessarily equate with substantially higher national averages of per capita/per annum litres of pure alcohol consumption. There is also a physical aspect to national differences worldwide, which has not yet been thoroughly studied, whereby some ethnic groups have a greater capacity for alcohol metabolization through the liver enzymes alcohol dehydrogenase and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase. These varying capacities do not, however, avoid all health risks inherent in heavy alcohol consumption. Alcohol abuse is associated with a variety of negative health and safety outcomes. This is true no matter the individual's or the ethnic group's perceived ability to \\"handle alcohol\\". Persons who believe themselves immune to the effects of alcohol may often be the most at risk for health concerns and the most dangerous of all operating a vehicle. \\"Chronic heavy drinkers display functional tolerance when they show few obvious signs of intoxication, even at high blood alcohol concentrations which in others would be incapacitating or even fatal. Because the drinker does not experience significant behavioral impairment as a result of drinking, tolerance may facilitate the consumption of increasing amounts of alcohol. This can result in physical dependence and alcohol-related organ damage.\\" Speed drinking Steven Petrosino achieving the Guinness World Record for speed drinking in June 1977 at the Gingerbreadman Pub in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. Speed drinking or competitive drinking is the drinking of a small or moderate quantity of beer in the shortest period of time, without an intention of getting heavily intoxicated. Unlike binge drinking, its focus is on competition or the establishment of a record. Speed drinkers typically drink a light beer, such as lager, and they allow it to warm and lose its carbonation to shorten the drinking time. Guinness World Records (1990 edition, p. 464) listed several records for speed drinking. Among these were: * Peter G. Dowdeswell (born 1940) of Earls Barton, Northamptonshire, England, drank in 6 seconds on February 7, 1975. * Steven Petrosino (born 1951) of New Cumberland, Pennsylvania, US, drank in 1.3 seconds on June 22, 1977, at the Gingerbread Man Pub in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. Neither of these records had been defeated when Guinness World Records banned all alcohol-related records from their book in 1991. Former Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke held a record for the fastest consumption of a yard of ale. He drank in 12 seconds.

The voivodeship was divided into 17 districts (powiaty). At the end of World War II, at the insistence of Joseph Stalin during the Tehran Conference of 1943 without official Polish representation whatsoever, the borders of Poland were redrawn by the Allies. The Polish population was forcibly resettled after the defeat of Nazi Germany and the Tarnopol Voivodeship was incorporated into the Ukrainian SSR of the Soviet Union. Since 1991, most of the region is located in the Ternopil Oblast in sovereign Ukraine. September 1939 and its aftermath During the German-Soviet invasion of Poland in accordance with the secret protocol of Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact, the Soviet forces allied with Nazi Germany invaded eastern Poland on 17 September 1939. As the bulk of the Polish Army was concentrated in the west fighting the Germans (see also: Polish September Campaign), the Red Army met with limited resistance and their troops quickly moved westward. Tarnopol was occupied as early as 18 September 1939 without substantial opposition from the Poles, and remained in Soviet hands till Operation Barbarossa.Kresy.co.uk ‚Äì History of Podolia and Tarnopol. Monuments were destroyed, street names changed, bookshops closed, library collections stolen and transported in lorries to the Russian archives.

During the German attack on the Soviet Union in 1941, Tarnopol was overrun by the Wehrmacht on . A Jewish pogrom lasted from until , with homes destroyed, synagogue burned and Jews killed indiscriminately at various locations, estimated between 1,600 (Yad Vashem) and 2,000 (Virtual Shtetl). The killings were perpetrated by the SS- Sonderkommando 4b attached to Einsatzgruppe C, and by the Ukrainian People's Militia, formed by Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists ‚Äì renamed the following month as the Ukrainian Auxiliary Police. In September 1941, the German occupation authorities established Jewish ghettos in a number of towns including the Tarnopol Ghetto with 12,000‚Äì13,000 prisoners. Death penalty was introduced, and food severely rationed. Forced labour camps for Jewish slave workers were established by the Germans in the settlements of Kamionki, H≈Çuboczek Wielki, Zagrobela, and in Podwo≈Çoczyska. The Tarnopol ghetto was liquidated between August 1942 and June 1943. The victims were deported to Belzec extermination camp. Many Jews were denounced by Ukrainian nationalists including shortly before the Soviets took over the area in 1944. A number survived by hiding with the Poles. Demographics The capital of Tarnopol Voivodeship was Tarnopol. After the rebirth of Poland, according to Polish census of 1921, the province was inhabited by 1,428,520 people with population density at 88 persons per km¬≤. The national census revealed that a staggering number of people could not read or write due to repressive policies of the partitioning powers; amounting to over half of the regional population of the Republic. Within the total number of inhabitants there were 447,810 Roman Catholics, and 847,907 Greek Catholics, as well as 128,967 Orthodox Christians. Ten years later, the next national census of September 1931 was conducted using different criteria. The respondents were asked about their mother tongue and religion. The population density grew to 97 persons per km2. The overall number of inhabitants in the province amounted to 1,600,406 people in 1931 of whom 789,114 spoke Polish, 401,963 spoke Ukrainian as their first language, 326,172 spoke Ruthenian, 71,890 spoke Yiddish, 7,042 spoke Hebrew, 2675 spoke German, and 287 spoke Belarusian, Czech and Lithuanian. Among the Poland's Ukrainian speakers, 397,248 belonged to Greek Catholic Church, and 3,767 were Roman Catholics similar to the majority of Polish language speakers at home; nevertheless, among the Polish language speakers 157,219 belonged to Greek Catholic Church also, like the majority of those who spoke Ukrainian as their mother tongue. The overlapping of religious denominations presented the community as integrated to a considerable degree. Meanwhile, the overwhelming majority of Ruthenian speakers were Greco Catholics, like Ukrainians, and only 7,625 of them were Roman Catholics.Central Statistical office of the Polish Republic, 1931 Census of Poland; Table 10 at Wikimedia Commons (extract). Jews constituted 44% of the diverse multicultural makeup of Tarnopol, speaking both, Yiddish and Hebrew.Central Statistical Office (Poland), Drugi Powszechny Spis Ludno≈õci. Woj.tarnopolskie, 1931. PDF file, 21.09 MB. The complete text of the Polish census of 1931 for the Tarnopol Voivodeship, page 59 (select, drop-down menu). Wikimedia Commons. Religion was 60% Greek Catholic, 31% Roman Catholic, 9% Jewish. Ethnic Rusyn Greek Catholics and Polish-speaking secular Jews were in some cases classified as gentile Poles in the ethnic census, and not as Ukrainians or Jews; this explains the difference between the religious and ethnic census numbers. Geography Tarnopol Voivodeship until 17 September 1939 The Voivodeship's area was 16,533 square kilometers. It was located in south-eastern corner of Poland, bordering Soviet Union to the east, Lw√≥w Voivodeship and Stanis≈Çaw√≥w Voivodeship to the west, Romania to the south and Volhynian Voivodeship to the north. The landscape was hilly, with the Podole upland covering large part of the Voivodeship. In the north-west there is the Hologory range with the Kamula mountain (473 meters above sea level) as the highest peak (however, the Kamula was located some 5 kilometers beyond the Voivodeship's borderline, in the Lw√≥w Voivodeship). Southern part of the Voivodeship was known for its wineries and peach orchards. The Dniester and the Seret were the main rivers. Border with the Soviet Union was marked by the Zbruch River, along its whole course. Border of the Voivodeship (and at the same time ‚Äì of Poland) with Romania was marked by the Dniester. The south- easternmost place was the famous Polish stronghold Okopy Swietej Trojcy (Ramparts of the Hole Trinity), which for some time was protecting Poland from the invasions of the Turks and the Tartars. Administrative subdivisions The Tarnopol Voivodeship was created formally on 23 December 1920. It consisted of 17 powiats (counties), 35 towns and 1087 villages. Its capital was also its largest city, with population of some 34,000 (as for 1931). Other important municipal centers of the voivodeship were: Czortk√≥w (pop. 19,000), Brody (pop. 16,400), Z≈Çocz√≥w (pop. 13,000), Brze≈ºany (pop. 12,000) and Buczacz (pop. 11,000). The Tarnopol Voivodeship consisted of 17 powiats (counties): Administrative division, 1938 # Borszcz√≥w Powiat (1067 km¬≤), # Brody Powiat 20px (1125 km¬≤) # Brze≈ºany Powiat (1135 km¬≤) # Buczacz Powiat (1208 km¬≤) # Czortk√≥w Powiat 20px (734 km¬≤) # Kamionka Strumi≈Çowa Powiat (1000 km¬≤) # Kopyczy≈Ñce Powiat (841 km¬≤) # Podhajce Powiat 20px (1018 km¬≤) # Przemy≈õlany Powiat (927 km¬≤) # Radziech√≥w Powiat (1022 km¬≤) # Ska≈Çat Powiat 17px (876 km¬≤) # Tarnopol Powiat 20px (1231 km¬≤) # Trembowla Powiat (789 km¬≤) # Zaleszczyki Powiat 22px (684 km¬≤) # Zbara≈º Powiat (740 km¬≤) # Zbor√≥w Powiat (941 km¬≤) # Z≈Çocz√≥w Powiat (1195 km¬≤) Economy Tarnopol Voivodeship was located in the so-called Poland \\"B\\", which meant that it was underdeveloped, with scarce industry. However, agricultural production was good, due to moderate climate and rich, fertile black soil common in these areas of Europe.

It was originally known as Alexander Fleming House, a multi-storey office complex designed by Hungarian-born modernist architect Ern≈ë Goldfinger and constructed in the early 1960s for Arnold Lee of Imry Properties. The design was favoured both by the property developer Imry and by the London County Council as it promised the largest amount of lettable space and therefore the best financial return for the site. Some 55 m tall at its highest point, the original scheme consisted of three freestanding blocks, two of seven storeys and one of eighteen, grouped around a central piazza. It is located on Newington Causeway on the east side of the busy Elephant and Castle junction in inner south-east London. Ern≈ë Goldfinger proposed three main components of modern architecture, \\"the permanent structure; the much less permanent services and an even more fleeting component, the human requirements\\". These applied directly to the development where its eventual use was not known at the time of construction. Therefore, the internal design of the building was made as flexible as possible, providing open decks which could be readily subdivided and services re-routed. The building's original tenant was the Department of Health and Social Security, known as the Ministry of Health at the time, which probably led to its being named Alexander Fleming House, after the discoverer of penicillin. The development became its headquarters, and shortly afterwards Ern≈ë Goldfinger was commissioned to design two additional blocks, D and E. The building received a Civic Trust Award in 1964. The Health Department's headquarters became notorious for sick building syndrome and the DHSS civil servants were moved out in the early 1990s to a new headquarters across the road, first of all to Hannibal House and then Skipton House. The Executive staff moved to new headquarters on Whitehall, Richmond House. The design flexibility served the building well when it was saved from demolition and converted into a residential development and renamed \\"Metro Central Heights\\"Metro Central Heights. by St George PlcSt George Plc. (a division of Berkeley Group Holdings) in 1997. It was narrowly missed off English Heritage's roll of post-war buildings worthy of listing around the same time. The conversion cured the sick building syndrome, and added a gym and swimming pool to the complex. It now contains some 400 studio to three-bedroom flats which are in constant demand, especially by \\"young urban professionals\\" who value Elephant and Castle's proximity to the City and West End. Planning permission was granted on appeal for a further 15-storey block by St George Plc named Vantage Metro CentralVantage Metro Central . on what was formerly the development's surface car park in February 2004. This was completed in late 2008. This had originally been the site of both the Odeon cinema, also designed by Ern≈ë Goldfinger but demolished by Imry in 1988, and the huge Trocadero cinema that was cleared for blocks D and E of the development itself. Metro Central Heights became a listed building on 9 July 2013, when the Minister for Culture, Ed Vaizey MP accepted English Heritage's recommendation that it should be listed at Grade II.

As a prominent Zionist leader, he was presented with the famous Balfour Declaration which pledged to a Jewish national home in Palestine. Rothschild was the president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews from 1925 to 1926.  Early life  Walter Rothschild was born in London as the eldest son and heir of Emma Louise von Rothschild and Nathan Rothschild, 1st Baron Rothschild, an immensely wealthy financier of the international Rothschild financial dynasty and the first Jewish peer in England. The eldest of three children, Walter was deemed to have delicate health and was educated at home. As a young man, he traveled in Europe, attending the University of Bonn for a year before entering Magdalene College, Cambridge. In 1889, leaving Cambridge after two years, he was required to go into the family banking business to study finance. At the age of seven, he declared that he would run a zoological museum and, as a child, he collected insects, butterflies and other animals. Among his pets at the family home in Tring Park were kangaroos and exotic birds. As a boy, Rothschild was once dragged off his horse and assaulted by workmen while on a hunting ride near Tring, an experience that he personally attributed to antisemitism. At 21, he reluctantly went to work at the family bank, N M Rothschild & Sons in London. He worked there from 1889 to 1908. He evidently lacked any interest or ability in the financial profession, but it was not until 1908, at the age of 40, that he was finally allowed to give it up. However, his parents established a zoological museum as a compensation and footed the bill for expeditions all over the world to seek out animals. Rothschild was tall, suffered from a speech impediment and was very shy, but he had his photograph taken riding on a giant tortoise and drove a carriage harnessed to four zebras to Buckingham Palace to prove that zebras could be tamed. Though he never married, Rothschild had two mistresses, one of whom bore him a daughter.  Zoological career  Rothschild with his famed zebra (Equus quagga) carriage, which he drove to Buckingham Palace to demonstrate the tame character of zebras to the public Lord Rothschild on a giant tortoise Rothschild studied zoology at Magdalene College, Cambridge. Meeting Albert G√ºnther sparked his interest in the taxonomy of birds and butterflies. Although Rothschild himself travelled and collected in Europe and North Africa for many years, his work and health concerns limited his range and beginning while at Cambridge he employed others (explorers, professional collectors and residents) to collect for him in remote and little-known parts of the world. He also hired taxidermists, a librarian and, most importantly, professional scientists to work with him to curate and write up the resulting collections: Ernst Hartert, for birds, from 1892 until his retirement at the age of 70 in 1930 and Karl Jordan for entomology, from 1893 until Rothschild's death in 1937. At its largest, Rothschild's collection included 300,000 bird skins, 200,000 birds' eggs, 2,250,000 butterflies and 30,000 beetles as well as thousands of specimens of mammals, reptiles and fishes. They formed the largest zoological collection ever amassed by a private individual. The Rothschild giraffe (Giraffa camelopardis rothschildi), a subspecies with five ossicones instead of two, was named after him. Another 153 insects, 58 birds, 17 mammals, three fish, three spiders, two reptiles, one millipede and one worm also carry his name. Rothschild opened his private museum in 1892. It housed one of the largest natural history collections in the world and was open to the public. In 1932, he was forced to sell the vast majority of his bird collection to the American Museum of Natural History after he had been blackmailed by a former mistress. On his death in 1937, the museum and all of its contents were given in his will to the British Museum (of which the Natural History Museum, London was then a part), the greatest accession that the institution has ever received. The Walter Rothschild Zoological Museum at Tring is now a division of the Natural History Museum. Following a visit to Hungary in 1902, Rothschild brought six live edible dormice (Glis glis) back to Tring. Some of them escaped and started breeding successfully in the wild. They have now become a localised pest over an area of approximately 200 square miles in a triangle between Luton, Aylesbury and Beaconsfield, and there are estimated to be at least 10,000 of them. Even though considered an invasive species, they are protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. Rothschild was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Giessen in 1898, was elected a Trustee of the British Museum in 1899 and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1911.  Political career  Spy for Vanity Fair, 1900 Walter Rothschild was a Conservative Member of Parliament for Aylesbury from 1899 until he retired from politics at the January 1910 general election.  Military activities  Despite his health, Rothschild served part-time as an officer in a Territorial Army unit, the Royal Buckinghamshire Yeomanry, where he was a captain from July 1902, promoted to major in 1903 and retiring in 1909.  Zionism and Balfour Declaration  As an active Zionist and a close friend of Chaim Weizmann, he worked to formulate the draft declaration for a Jewish homeland in Palestine. On 2 November 1917, he received a letter from the British foreign secretary, Arthur Balfour, addressed to his London home at 148 Piccadilly. In the letter, the British government declared its support for the establishment in Palestine of \\"a national home for the Jewish people\\". The letter became known as the Balfour Declaration.  Peerage  Walter inherited the British peerage title \\"Baron Rothschild\\" from his father Nathan Mayer Rothschild, 1st Baron Rothschild in 1915. He died in 1937 at Tring Park, Hertfordshire, aged 69, and was buried in Willesden Jewish Cemetery, London. He had no legitimate children and his younger brother Charles Rothschild had predeceased him, so the title was inherited by his nephew (Nathaniel Mayer) Victor Rothschild. He also inherited the title \\"Baron de Rothschild\\" (Freiherr von Rothschild) of the Austrian nobility, which was an authorized title in the United Kingdom by Warrant of 27 April 1932. In 1838, Queen Victoria had authorized the use of this Austrian title in the United Kingdom.

According to the botanist Peter Collinson, who visited the physic garden in July 1764 and recorded his observation in his commonplace books, Miller \\"has raised the reputation of the Chelsea Garden so much that it excels all the gardens of Europe for its amazing variety of plants of all orders and classes and from all climates...\\" He wrote The Gardener's and Florists Dictionary or a Complete System of Horticulture (1724) and The Gardener's Dictionary containing the Methods of Cultivating and Improving the Kitchen Fruit and Flower Garden, which first appeared in 1731 in an impressive folio and passed through eight expanding editions in his lifetime and was translated into Dutch by Job Baster. Miller corresponded with other botanists, and obtained plants from all over the world, many of which he cultivated for the first time in England and is credited as their introducer. His knowledge of living plants, for which he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, was unsurpassed in breadth in his lifetime.Frans A. Stafleu, reviewing the facsimile of The Gardeners Dictionary in Taxon 18.6 (December 1969:713‚Äì715) p 713. He trained William Aiton, who later became head gardener at Kew, and William Forsyth, after whom Forsythia was named. The Duke of Bedford contracted him to supervise the pruning of fruit trees at Woburn Abbey and the care of his prized collection of American trees, especially evergreens, which were grown from seeds that, on Miller's suggestion, had been sent in barrels from Pennsylvania, where they had been collected by John Bartram.Le Rougetel 1986:32, quoting John Collinson's letter to the Duke of Bedford. Through a consortium of sixty subscribers, 1733‚Äì66, the contents of Bartram's boxes introduced such American trees as Abies balsamea and Pinus rigida into English gardens. Miller was reluctant to use the new binomial nomenclature of Carl Linnaeus, preferring the classifications of Joseph Pitton de Tournefort and John Ray at first. Linnaeus, nevertheless, applauded Miller's Gardeners Dictionary,Non erit Lexicon Hortulanorum, sed etiam Botanicorum, that the book will be, not just a lexicon of gardeners, but of botanists.\\"; noted in Paterson 1986:40‚Äì41. The conservative Scot actually retained a number of pre-Linnaean binomial signifiers discarded by Linnaeus but which have been retained by modern botanists. He only fully changed to the Linnaean system in the edition of The Gardeners Dictionary of 1768, though he had already described some genera, such as Larix and Vanilla, validly under the Linnaean system earlier, in the fourth edition (1754). Miller sent the first long-strand cotton seeds, which he had developed, to the new British colony of Georgia in 1733. They were first planted on Sea Island, off the coast of Georgia, and hence derived the name of the finest cotton, Sea Island Cotton. The presumed portrait, engraved by C.J. Maillet and affixed to the posthumous French edition of Miller's Gardeners Dictionary, 1787, shows the wrong Miller, John Frederick Miller, son of the London-based Nuremberg artist Johann Sebastian M√ºller. No authentic portrait is known. Miller's two sons worked under him; one, Charles, became the first head of the Cambridge Botanic Garden. your bitcoinNotes References Bibliography * Philip Miller and the Gardeners Dictionary.

It was defined by the algebraist Richard Brauer. The Brauer group arose out of attempts to classify division algebras over a field. It can also be defined in terms of Galois cohomology. More generally, the Brauer group of a scheme is defined in terms of Azumaya algebras, or equivalently using projective bundles.  Construction  A central simple algebra (CSA) over a field K is a finite-dimensional associative K-algebra A such that A is a simple ring and the center of A is equal to K. Note that CSAs are in general not division algebras, though CSAs can be used to classify division algebras. For example, the complex numbers C form a CSA over themselves, but not over R (the center is C itself, hence too large to be CSA over R). The finite-dimensional division algebras with center R (that means the dimension over R is finite) are the real numbers and the quaternions by a theorem of Frobenius, while any matrix ring over the reals or quaternions ‚Äì M(n, R) or M(n, H) ‚Äì is a CSA over the reals, but not a division algebra (if n > 1). We obtain an equivalence relation on CSAs over K by the Artin‚ÄìWedderburn theorem (Wedderburn's part, in fact), to express any CSA as a M(n, D) for some division algebra D. If we look just at D, that is, if we impose an equivalence relation identifying M(m, D) with M(n, D) for all positive integers m and n, we get the Brauer equivalence relation on CSAs over K. The elements of the Brauer group are the Brauer equivalence classes of CSAs over K. Given central simple algebras A and B, one can look at their tensor product A ‚äó B as a K-algebra (see tensor product of R-algebras). It turns out that this is always central simple. A slick way to see this is to use a characterization: a central simple algebra A over K is a K-algebra that becomes a matrix ring when we extend the field of scalars to an algebraic closure of K. This result also shows that the dimension of a central simple algebra A as a K-vector space is always a square. The degree of A is defined to be the square root of its dimension. As a result, the isomorphism classes of CSAs over K form a monoid under tensor product, compatible with Brauer equivalence, and the Brauer classes are all invertible: the inverse of an algebra A is given by its opposite algebra Aop (the opposite ring with the same action by K since the image of K ‚Üí A is in the center of A). Explicitly, for a CSA A we have A ‚äó Aop = M(n2, K), where n is the degree of A over K. The Brauer group of any field is a torsion group. In more detail, define the period of a central simple algebra A over K to be its order as an element of the Brauer group. Define the index of A to be the degree of the division algebra that is Brauer equivalent to A. Then the period of A divides the index of A (and hence is finite).Farb & Dennis (1993), Proposition 4.16.  Examples  * In the following cases, every finite-dimensional central division algebra over a field K is K itself, so that the Brauer group Br(K) is trivial: ** K is an algebraically closed field. ** K is a finite field (Wedderburn's theorem).Serre (1979), p. 162. Equivalently, every finite division ring is commutative. ** K is the function field of an algebraic curve over an algebraically closed field (Tsen's theorem).Gille & Szamuely (2006), Theorem 6.2.8. More generally, the Brauer group vanishes for any C1 field. ** K is an algebraic extension of Q containing all roots of unity. * The Brauer group Br(R) of the field R of real numbers is the cyclic group of order two. There are just two non-isomorphic real division algebras with center R: R itself and the quaternion algebra H.Serre (1979), p. 163. Since H ‚äó H ‚âÖ M(4, R), the class of H has order two in the Brauer group. * Let K be a non-Archimedean local field, meaning that K is complete under a discrete valuation with finite residue field. Then Br(K) is isomorphic to Q/Z.Serre (1979), p. 193.  Severi‚ÄìBrauer varieties  Another important interpretation of the Brauer group of a field K is that it classifies the projective varieties over K that become isomorphic to projective space over an algebraic closure of K. Such a variety is called a Severi‚ÄìBrauer variety, and there is a one-to-one correspondence between the isomorphism classes of Severi‚ÄìBrauer varieties of dimension n‚àí1 over K and the central simple algebras of degree n over K.Gille & Szamuely (2006), section 5.2. For example, the Severi‚ÄìBrauer varieties of dimension 1 are exactly the smooth conics in the projective plane over K. For a field K of characteristic not 2, every conic over K is isomorphic to one of the form ax2 \\\\+ by2 = z2 for some nonzero elements a and b of K. The corresponding central simple algebra is the quaternion algebraGille & Szamuely (2006), Theorem 1.4.2. :(a,b) = K\\\\langle i,j\\\\rangle/(i^2=a, j^2=b, ij=-ji). The conic is isomorphic to the projective line P1 over K if and only if the corresponding quaternion algebra is isomorphic to the matrix algebra M(2, K).  Cyclic algebras  For a positive integer n, let K be a field in which n is invertible such that K contains a primitive nth root of unity Œ∂. For nonzero elements a and b of K, the associated cyclic algebra is the central simple algebra of degree n over K defined by :(a,b)_{\\\\zeta} = K\\\\langle u,v\\\\rangle/(u^n=a, v^n=b, uv=\\\\zeta vu). Cyclic algebras are the best- understood central simple algebras. (When n is not invertible in K or K does not have a primitive nth root of unity, a similar construction gives the cyclic algebra (œá, a) associated to a cyclic Z/n-extension œá of K and a nonzero element a of K.Gille & Szamuely (2006), Proposition 2.5.2.) The Merkurjev‚ÄìSuslin theorem in algebraic K-theory has a strong consequence about the Brauer group. Namely, for a positive integer n, let K be a field in which n is invertible such that K contains a primitive nth root of unity. Then the subgroup of the Brauer group of K killed by n is generated by cyclic algebras of degree n.Gille & Szamuely (2006), Theorem 2.5.7. Equivalently, any division algebra of period dividing n is Brauer equivalent to a tensor product of cyclic algebras of degree n. Even for a prime number p, there are examples showing that a division algebra of period p need not be actually isomorphic to a tensor product of cyclic algebras of degree p.Gille & Szamuely (2006), Remark 2.5.8. It is a major open problem (raised by Albert) whether every division algebra of prime degree over a field is cyclic. This is true if the degree is 2 or 3, but the problem is wide open for primes at least 5. The known results are only for special classes of fields. For example, if K is a global field or local field, then a division algebra of any degree over K is cyclic, by Albert‚ÄìBrauer‚ÄìHasse‚ÄìNoether.Pierce (1982), section 18.6. A \\"higher- dimensional\\" result in the same direction was proved by Saltman: if K is a field of transcendence degree 1 over the local field Qp, then every division algebra of prime degree l ‚â† p over K is cyclic.Saltman (2007).  The period- index problem  For any central simple algebra A over a field K, the period of A divides the index of A, and the two numbers have the same prime factors.Gille & Szamuely (2006), Proposition 4.5.13. The period-index problem is to bound the index in terms of the period, for fields K of interest. For example, if A is a central simple algebra over a local field or global field, then Albert‚ÄìBrauer‚ÄìHasse‚ÄìNoether showed that the index of A is equal to the period of A. For a central simple algebra A over a field K of transcendence degree n over an algebraically closed field, it is conjectured that ind(A) divides per(A)n‚àí1. This is true for n ‚â§ 2, the case n = 2 being an important advance by de Jong, sharpened in positive characteristic by de Jong‚ÄìStarr and Lieblich.de Jong (2004).  Class field theory  The Brauer group plays an important role in the modern formulation of class field theory. If Kv is a non-Archimedean local field, local class field theory gives a canonical isomorphism invv: Br(Kv) ‚Üí Q/Z, the Hasse invariant. The case of a global field K (such as a number field) is addressed by global class field theory. If D is a central simple algebra over K and v is a place of K, then D ‚äó Kv is a central simple algebra over Kv, the completion of K at v. This defines a homomorphism from the Brauer group of K into the Brauer group of Kv. A given central simple algebra D splits for all but finitely many v, so that the image of D under almost all such homomorphisms is 0. The Brauer group Br(K) fits into an exact sequence constructed by Hasse:Gille & Szamuely (2006), p. 159.Pierce (1982), section 18.5. : 0\\\\rightarrow \\\\textrm{Br}(K)\\\\rightarrow \\\\bigoplus_{v\\\\in S} \\\\textrm{Br}(K_v)\\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbf{Q}/\\\\mathbf{Z} \\\\rightarrow 0, where S is the set of all places of K and the right arrow is the sum of the local invariants; the Brauer group of the real numbers is identified with (1/2)Z/Z. The injectivity of the left arrow is the content of the Albert‚ÄìBrauer‚ÄìHasse‚ÄìNoether theorem. The fact that the sum of all local invariants of a central simple algebra over K is zero is a typical reciprocity law. For example, applying this to a quaternion algebra (a, b) over Q gives the quadratic reciprocity law.  Galois cohomology  For an arbitrary field K, the Brauer group can be expressed in terms of Galois cohomology as follows:Serre (1979), pp. 157‚Äì159. :\\\\textrm{Br}(K) \\\\cong H^2(K, G_m), where Gm denotes the multiplicative group, viewed as an algebraic group over K. More concretely, the cohomology group indicated means H2(Gal(Ks/K), Ks*), where Ks denotes a separable closure of K. The isomorphism of the Brauer group with a Galois cohomology group can be described as follows. The automorphism group of the algebra of n √ó n matrices is the projective linear group PGL(n). Since all central simple algebras over K become isomorphic to the matrix algebra over a separable closure of K, the set of isomorphism classes of central simple algebras of degree n over K can be identified with the Galois cohomology set H1(K, PGL(n)). The class of a central simple algebra in H2(K, Gm) is the image of its class in H1 under the boundary homomorphism :H^1(K, PGL(n)) \\\\rightarrow H^2(K, G_m) associated to the short exact sequence 1 ‚Üí Gm ‚Üí GL(n) ‚Üí PGL(n) ‚Üí 1.  The Brauer group of a scheme  The Brauer group was generalized from fields to commutative rings by Auslander and Goldman. Grothendieck went further by defining the Brauer group of any scheme. There are two ways of defining the Brauer group of a scheme X, using either Azumaya algebras over X or projective bundles over X. The second definition involves projective bundles that are locally trivial in the √©tale topology, not necessarily in the Zariski topology. In particular, a projective bundle is defined to be zero in the Brauer group if and only if it is the projectivization of some vector bundle. The cohomological Brauer group of a quasi-compact scheme X is defined to be the torsion subgroup of the √©tale cohomology group H2(X, Gm). (The whole group H2(X, Gm) need not be torsion, although it is torsion for regular schemes X.Milne (1980), Corollary IV.2.6.) The Brauer group is always a subgroup of the cohomological Brauer group. Gabber showed that the Brauer group is equal to the cohomological Brauer group for any scheme with an ample line bundle (for example, any quasi-projective scheme over a commutative ring).de Jong, A result of Gabber. The whole group H2(X, Gm) can be viewed as classifying the gerbes over X with structure group Gm. For smooth projective varieties over a field, the Brauer group is a birational invariant. It has been fruitful. For example, when X is also rationally connected over the complex numbers, the Brauer group of X is isomorphic to the torsion subgroup of the singular cohomology group H3(X, Z), which is therefore a birational invariant. Artin and Mumford used this description of the Brauer group to give the first example of a unirational variety X over C that is not stably rational (that is, no product of X with a projective space is rational).Colliot-Th√©l√®ne (1995), Proposition 4.2.3 and section 4.2.4.  Relation to the Tate conjecture  Artin conjectured that every proper scheme over the integers has finite Brauer group.Milne (1980), Question IV.2.19. This is far from known even in the special case of a smooth projective variety X over a finite field. Indeed, the finiteness of the Brauer group for surfaces in that case is equivalent to the Tate conjecture for divisors on X, one of the main problems in the theory of algebraic cycles.Tate (1994), Proposition 4.3. For a regular integral scheme of dimension 2 which is flat and proper over the ring of integers of a number field, and which has a section, the finiteness of the Brauer group is equivalent to the finiteness of the Tate‚ÄìShafarevich group –® for the Jacobian variety of the general fiber (a curve over a number field).Grothendieck (1968), Le groupe de Brauer III, Proposition 4.5. The finiteness of –® is a central problem in the arithmetic of elliptic curves and more generally abelian varieties.  The Brauer‚ÄìManin obstruction  Let X be a smooth projective variety over a number field K. The Hasse principle would predict that if X has a rational point over all completions Kv of K, then X has a K-rational point. The Hasse principle holds for some special classes of varieties, but not in general. Manin used the Brauer group of X to define the Brauer‚ÄìManin obstruction, which can be applied in many cases to show that X has no K-points even when X has points over all completions of K.

As an example, note that any simple algebra is a central simple algebra over its center. For example, the complex numbers C form a CSA over themselves, but not over the real numbers R (the center of C is all of C, not just R). The quaternions H form a 4-dimensional CSA over R, and in fact represent the only non-trivial element of the Brauer group of the reals (see below). Given two central simple algebras A ~ M(n,S) and B ~ M(m,T) over the same field F, A and B are called similar (or Brauer equivalent) if their division rings S and T are isomorphic. The set of all equivalence classes of central simple algebras over a given field F, under this equivalence relation, can be equipped with a group operation given by the tensor product of algebras. The resulting group is called the Brauer group Br(F) of the field F.Lorenz (2008) p.159 It is always a torsion group.Lorenz (2008) p.194 Properties * According to the Artin‚ÄìWedderburn theorem a finite-dimensional simple algebra A is isomorphic to the matrix algebra M(n,S) for some division ring S. Hence, there is a unique division algebra in each Brauer equivalence class.Lorenz (2008) p.160 * Every automorphism of a central simple algebra is an inner automorphism (follows from Skolem‚ÄìNoether theorem). * The dimension of a central simple algebra as a vector space over its centre is always a square: the degree is the square root of this dimension.Gille & Szamuely (2006) p.21 The Schur index of a central simple algebra is the degree of the equivalent division algebra:Lorenz (2008) p.163 it depends only on the Brauer class of the algebra.Gille & Szamuely (2006) p.100 * The period or exponent of a central simple algebra is the order of its Brauer class as an element of the Brauer group. It is a divisor of the index,Jacobson (1996) p.60 and the two numbers are composed of the same prime factors.Jacobson (1996) p.61Gille & Szamuely (2006) p.104 * If S is a simple subalgebra of a central simple algebra A then dimF S divides dimF A. * Every 4-dimensional central simple algebra over a field F is isomorphic to a quaternion algebra; in fact, it is either a two-by-two matrix algebra, or a division algebra. * If D is a central division algebra over K for which the index has prime factorisation ::\\\\mathrm{ind}(D) = \\\\prod_{i=1}^r p_i^{m_i} \\\\ :then D has a tensor product decomposition ::D = \\\\bigotimes_{i=1}^r D_i \\\\ :where each component Di is a central division algebra of index p_i^{m_i}, and the components are uniquely determined up to isomorphism.Gille & Szamuely (2006) p.105 Splitting field We call a field E a splitting field for A over K if A‚äóE is isomorphic to a matrix ring over E. Every finite dimensional CSA has a splitting field: indeed, in the case when A is a division algebra, then a maximal subfield of A is a splitting field. In general by theorems of Wedderburn and Koethe there is a splitting field which is a separable extension of K of degree equal to the index of A, and this splitting field is isomorphic to a subfield of A.Jacobson (1996) pp.27-28Gille & Szamuely (2006) p.101 As an example, the field C splits the quaternion algebra H over R with : t + x \\\\mathbf{i} + y \\\\mathbf{j} + z \\\\mathbf{k} \\\\leftrightarrow \\\\left({\\\\begin{array}{*{20}c} t + x i & y + z i \\\\\\\\\\\\ -y + z i & t - x i \\\\end{array}}\\\\right) . We can use the existence of the splitting field to define reduced norm and reduced trace for a CSA A.Gille & Szamuely (2006) pp.37-38 Map A to a matrix ring over a splitting field and define the reduced norm and trace to be the composite of this map with determinant and trace respectively. For example, in the quaternion algebra H, the splitting above shows that the element t + x i + y j + z k has reduced norm t2 \\\\+ x2 \\\\+ y2 \\\\+ z2 and reduced trace 2t. The reduced norm is multiplicative and the reduced trace is additive. An element a of A is invertible if and only if its reduced norm in non-zero: hence a CSA is a division algebra if and only if the reduced norm is non-zero on the non-zero elements.Gille & Szamuely (2006) p.38 Generalization CSAs over a field K are a non-commutative analog to extension fields over K ‚Äì in both cases, they have no non-trivial 2-sided ideals, and have a distinguished field in their center, though a CSA can be non-commutative and need not have inverses (need not be a division algebra).

He served as a U.S. Representative and United States Senator, and held leadership positions in both bodies. Born in Dracut in the Province of Massachusetts Bay, Varnum was the son of farmer, militia officer and local official Samuel Varnum and Mary Prime. He received a limited formal education, but became a self-taught scholar. Varnum became a farmer, and at age 18 received his commission as a captain in the Massachusetts militia. He commanded Dracut's militia company during the American Revolution and remained in the militia afterwards, eventually attaining the rank of major general in 1805. Varnum took part in the government of Massachusetts following independence, including member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 1780 to 1785 and member of the Massachusetts State Senate from 1786 to 1795. Despite not being an attorney, Varnum also served as a judge, including terms as a Justice of the Massachusetts Court of Common Pleas and Chief Justice of the Massachusetts Court of General Sessions. He was a member of the U.S. House from 1795 to 1811, and was Speaker of the House from 1807 to 1811. Varnum served in the U.S. Senate from 1811 to 1817, and was the Senate's President pro tempore from 1813 to 1814. After leaving the U.S. Senate, Varnum served in the Massachusetts State Senate until his death. He died in Dracut on September 21, 1821 and was buried at Varnum Cemetery in Dracut. Biography Joseph Bradley Varnum was born in Dracut, Massachusetts, in Middlesex County, on January 29, 1750 or 1751. At the age of eighteen, he was commissioned captain by the committee of Massachusetts Bay Colony, and in 1787 colonel by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. He was made brigadier general in 1802, and in 1805 major general of the state militia, holding the latter office at his death in 1821. After serving in the Massachusetts militia during the American Revolutionary War, Varnum helped to destroy the Shays insurrection before he was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives (1780‚Äì1785) and then the Massachusetts State Senate (1786‚Äì1795). He also served as a Justice of the Massachusetts Court of Common Pleas and as Chief Justice of the Massachusetts Court of General Sessions. In 1794, Varnum was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, where he served from March 4, 1795 until his resignation on June 29, 1811. During his last four years in the House, he served as its Speaker. Varnum was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1811 to fill the vacancy in the term. He became the only U.S. Senator from the Democratic-Republican Party in Massachusetts history. Varnum served as President pro tempore of the U.S. Senate from December 6, 1813 to February 3, 1814, during the Thirteenth Congress. He was also the Chair of the Senate Committee on Militia during the Fourteenth Congress. After returning to Massachusetts in 1817, Varnum again served in the Massachusetts State Senate, until his death on September 21, 1821. Varnum died in Dracut, and is interred in Varnum Cemetery in that town. His brother was Major General James Mitchell Varnum who commanded the 1st Rhode Island Regiment from 1775 to 1777, served as a brigade commander at the Battle of Rhode Island and later served as the major general in command of the Rhode Island Militia. Slavery Henry Wilson, in his History of Slavery, quotes Varnum in the debate on the bill for the government of the Mississippi Territory before the United States House of Representatives in March 1798 as having been very strong and outspoken in his opposition to Negro servitude. Varnum developed a strong friendship with Silas Royal, a former slave freed by the Varnum family, who also served with him during the war. On March 3, 1805, Varnum submitted a Massachusetts Proposition to amend the ConstitutionIn the 1786 US Constitution there was a provision in Article I ‚Äì the part of the document dealing with the duties of the legislative branch: Section 9. The migration or importation of such persons as any of the states now existing shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by the Congress prior to the year one thousand eight hundred and eight, but a tax or duty may be imposed on such importation, not exceeding ten dollars for each person. In other words, the government could not ban the importation of slaves for 20 years after the adoption of the Constitution. And as the designated year 1808 approached, those opposed to slavery began making plans for legislation that would outlaw the trans-Atlantic slave trade. and Abolish the Slave Trade. This proposition was tabled until 1807, when under Varnum's leadership the amendment moved through Congress and passed both houses on March 2, 1807. President Thomas Jefferson signed it into law on March 3, 1807. Journal of the House of Representatives of the United States 1804‚Äì1807 March 3, 1805 Congressman Joseph Bradley Varnum, one of the members for the State of Massachusetts, presented to the House a letter from the Governor of the said State, enclosing an attested copy of two concurrent resolutions of the Senate and House of Representatives of the State of Massachusetts, passed the fifteenth of February, in the present year, \\"instructing the Senators, and requesting the Representatives in Congress, from the said State, to take all legal and necessary steps, to use their utmost exertions, as soon as the same is practicable, to obtain an amendment to the Federal Constitution, so as to authorize and empower the Congress of the United States to pass a law, whenever they may deem it expedient, to prevent the further importation of slaves from any of the West India Islands, from the coast of Africa, or elsewhere, into the United States, or any part thereof:\\" Whereupon, A motion was made and seconded that the House do come to the following resolution: Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, two-thirds of both Houses concurring, That the following article be proposed to the Legislatures of the several States, as an amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which, when ratified by three-fourths of the said Legislatures, shall be valid to all intents and purposes, as a part of the said Constitution, to wit: \\"That the Congress of the United States shall have power to prevent the further importation of slaves into the United States and the Territories thereof.\\" The said proposed resolution was read, and ordered to lie on the table.

It is an attempt to explain synaptic plasticity, the adaptation of brain neurons during the learning process. It was introduced by Donald Hebb in his 1949 book The Organization of Behavior. The theory is also called Hebb's rule, Hebb's postulate, and cell assembly theory. Hebb states it as follows: > Let us assume that the persistence or repetition of a reverberatory activity > (or \\"trace\\") tends to induce lasting cellular changes that add to its > stability. ... When an axon of cell A is near enough to excite a cell B and > repeatedly or persistently takes part in firing it, some growth process or > metabolic change takes place in one or both cells such that As efficiency, > as one of the cells firing B, is increased. The theory is often summarized as \\"Cells that fire together wire together.\\"Siegrid L√∂wel, G√∂ttingen University; The exact sentence is: \\"neurons wire together if they fire together\\" (L√∂wel, S. and Singer, W. (1992) Science 255 (published January 10, 1992) However, Hebb emphasized that cell A needs to \\"take part in firing\\" cell B, and such causality can occur only if cell A fires just before, not at the same time as, cell B. This aspect of causation in Hebb's work foreshadowed what is now known about spike-timing-dependent plasticity, which requires temporal precedence. The theory attempts to explain associative or Hebbian learning, in which simultaneous activation of cells leads to pronounced increases in synaptic strength between those cells. It also provides a biological basis for errorless learning methods for education and memory rehabilitation. In the study of neural networks in cognitive function, it is often regarded as the neuronal basis of unsupervised learning. Hebbian engrams and cell assembly theory Hebbian theory concerns how neurons might connect themselves to become engrams. Hebb's theories on the form and function of cell assemblies can be understood from the following: > The general idea is an old one, that any two cells or systems of cells that > are repeatedly active at the same time will tend to become 'associated' so > that activity in one facilitates activity in the other. Hebb also wrote: > When one cell repeatedly assists in firing another, the axon of the first > cell develops synaptic knobs (or enlarges them if they already exist) in > contact with the soma of the second cell. Gordon Allport posits additional ideas regarding cell assembly theory and its role in forming engrams, along the lines of the concept of auto-association, described as follows: > If the inputs to a system cause the same pattern of activity to occur > repeatedly, the set of active elements constituting that pattern will become > increasingly strongly interassociated. That is, each element will tend to > turn on every other element and (with negative weights) to turn off the > elements that do not form part of the pattern. To put it another way, the > pattern as a whole will become 'auto-associated'. We may call a learned > (auto-associated) pattern an engram. Hebbian theory has been the primary basis for the conventional view that, when analyzed from a holistic level, engrams are neuronal nets or neural networks. Work in the laboratory of Eric Kandel has provided evidence for the involvement of Hebbian learning mechanisms at synapses in the marine gastropod Aplysia californica. Experiments on Hebbian synapse modification mechanisms at the central nervous system synapses of vertebrates are much more difficult to control than are experiments with the relatively simple peripheral nervous system synapses studied in marine invertebrates. Much of the work on long- lasting synaptic changes between vertebrate neurons (such as long-term potentiation) involves the use of non-physiological experimental stimulation of brain cells. However, some of the physiologically relevant synapse modification mechanisms that have been studied in vertebrate brains do seem to be examples of Hebbian processes. One such study reviews results from experiments that indicate that long-lasting changes in synaptic strengths can be induced by physiologically relevant synaptic activity working through both Hebbian and non-Hebbian mechanisms. Principles From the point of view of artificial neurons and artificial neural networks, Hebb's principle can be described as a method of determining how to alter the weights between model neurons. The weight between two neurons increases if the two neurons activate simultaneously, and reduces if they activate separately. Nodes that tend to be either both positive or both negative at the same time have strong positive weights, while those that tend to be opposite have strong negative weights. The following is a formulaic description of Hebbian learning: (many other descriptions are possible) :\\\\,w_{ij}=x_ix_j where w_{ij} is the weight of the connection from neuron j to neuron i and x_i the input for neuron i . Note that this is pattern learning (weights updated after every training example). In a Hopfield network, connections w_{ij} are set to zero if i=j (no reflexive connections allowed). With binary neurons (activations either 0 or 1), connections would be set to 1 if the connected neurons have the same activation for a pattern. Another formulaic description is: :w_{ij} = \\\\frac{1}{p} \\\\sum_{k=1}^p x_i^k x_j^k,\\\\, where w_{ij} is the weight of the connection from neuron j to neuron i , p is the number of training patterns, and x_{i}^k the k th input for neuron i . This is learning by epoch (weights updated after all the training examples are presented). Again, in a Hopfield network, connections w_{ij} are set to zero if i=j (no reflexive connections). A variation of Hebbian learning that takes into account phenomena such as blocking and many other neural learning phenomena is the mathematical model of Harry Klopf.Klopf, A. H. (1972). Brain function and adaptive systems‚ÄîA heterostatic theory. Technical Report AFCRL-72-0164, Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories, Bedford, MA. Klopf's model reproduces a great many biological phenomena, and is also simple to implement. Generalization and stability Hebb's rule is often generalized as :\\\\Delta w_i = \\\\eta x_i y or the change in the ith synaptic weight w_i is equal to a learning rate \\\\eta times the ith input x_i times the postsynaptic response y. Often cited is the case of a linear neuron, :y = \\\\sum_j w_j x_j and the previous section's simplification takes both the learning rate and the input weights to be 1. This version of the rule is unstable, as in any network with a dominant signal the synaptic weights will increase or decrease exponentially. However, it can be shown that for any neuron model, Hebb's rule is unstable. Therefore, network models of neurons usually employ other learning theories such as BCM theory, Oja's rule, or the generalized Hebbian algorithm. Hebbian learning of intrinsic excitability Neurons also exhibit plasticity in their intrinsic excitability (intrinsic plasticity). Exceptions Despite the common use of Hebbian models for long-term potentiation, there exist several exceptions to Hebb's principles and examples that demonstrate that some aspects of the theory are oversimplified. One of the most well-documented of these exceptions pertains to how synaptic modification may not simply occur only between activated neurons A and B, but to neighboring neurons as well. This is due to how Hebbian modification depends on retrograde signaling in order to modify the presynaptic neuron. The compound most commonly identified as fulfilling this retrograde transmitter role is nitric oxide, which, due to its high solubility and diffusibility, often exerts effects on nearby neurons. This type of diffuse synaptic modification, known as volume learning, counters, or at least supplements, the traditional Hebbian model. Hebbian learning account of mirror neurons Hebbian learning and spike-timing-dependent plasticity have been used in an influential theory of how mirror neurons emerge.Keysers, C. (2011). The Empathic Brain. Mirror neurons are neurons that fire both when an individual performs an action and when the individual sees or hears another perform a similar action. The discovery of these neurons has been very influential in explaining how individuals make sense of the actions of others, by showing that, when a person perceives the actions of others, the person activates the motor programs which they would use to perform similar actions. The activation of these motor programs then adds information to the perception and helps predict what the person will do next based on the perceiver's own motor program. A challenge has been to explain how individuals come to have neurons that respond both while performing an action and while hearing or seeing another perform similar actions. Christian Keysers and David Perrett suggested that as an individual performs a particular action, the individual will see, hear, and feel the performing of the action. These re-afferent sensory signals will trigger activity in neurons responding to the sight, sound, and feel of the action. Because the activity of these sensory neurons will consistently overlap in time with those of the motor neurons that caused the action, Hebbian learning predicts that the synapses connecting neurons responding to the sight, sound, and feel of an action and those of the neurons triggering the action should be potentiated. The same is true while people look at themselves in the mirror, hear themselves babble, or are imitated by others. After repeated experience of this re-afference, the synapses connecting the sensory and motor representations of an action are so strong that the motor neurons start firing to the sound or the vision of the action, and a mirror neuron is created. Evidence for that perspective comes from many experiments that show that motor programs can be triggered by novel auditory or visual stimuli after repeated pairing of the stimulus with the execution of the motor program (for a review of the evidence, see Giudice et al., 2009). For instance, people who have never played the piano do not activate brain regions involved in playing the piano when listening to piano music. Five hours of piano lessons, in which the participant is exposed to the sound of the piano each time they press a key is proven sufficient to trigger activity in motor regions of the brain upon listening to piano music when heard at a later time. Consistent with the fact that spike-timing-dependent plasticity occurs only if the presynaptic neuron's firing predicts the post-synaptic neuron's firing, the link between sensory stimuli and motor programs also only seem to be potentiated if the stimulus is contingent on the motor program.

He was one of the signatories of the death warrant of Charles I. Life Danvers was the third and youngest son of Sir John Danvers of Dauntsey, Wiltshire, by Elizabeth Neville. In his youth, he travelled through France and Italy, developing sophisticated tastes in gardening and architecture, which he indulged at his house in Chelsea. Danvers was knighted by James I of England; and under Charles I became a gentleman of the privy chamber. He sat as a member of parliament for Arundel in 1610, Montgomery Boroughs in the Addled Parliament of 1614, Oxford University in 1621, Newport (Isle of Wight) in 1624 and again for Oxford University from 1625 to 1629. History of Parliament online article by Alan Davidson and Rosemary Sgroi. Danvers was engaged in mercantile transactions, and in 1624 he learned that the government were contemplating a seizure of the papers of the Virginia Company. With the aid of Edward Collingwood, the secretary, he had the whole of the records copied out and entrusted them to the care of Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton, a family friend, who deposited them at his house at Titchfield, Hampshire. Danvers fell into debt, and from 1630 to 1640 was apparently struggling with creditors. About 1640 he began an active political career in opposition to the king. He refused to contribute to the expenses of the king's expedition to Scotland in 1639, and was returned to the Short parliament of 1640 by Oxford University. In 1642 he took up arms for the parliament, and was granted a colonel's commission, which he held in command of the Wiltshire foot militia until 1650 but did not play a prominent part in military affairs. He gives an account of the opening incidents of the war in letters written to friends from Chelsea in July and August 1642. Danvers was ordered by the parliament to receive the Dutch ambassadors late in 1644, and on 10 October 1645 was returned to the house as member for Malmesbury in the place of Anthony Hungerford, disabled to sit. He took little part in the proceedings of the house, but was appointed a member of the commission nominated to try the king in January 1649. He was only twice absent from the meetings of the commission, and signed the death-warrant. In February of the same year Danvers was given a seat on the council of state, which he retained till the council's dissolution in 1653. He died at his house at Chelsea in April 1655, and was buried at Dauntsey. His name was in the Act of Attainder passed at the Restoration. Gardener At a young age Danvers acquired a fine garden and house at Chelsea: the latter he furnished sumptuously and curiously, and the former he laid out after the Italian manner. ' 'Twas Sir John Danvers of Chelsey,' John Aubrey writes, 'who first taught us the way of Italian gardens.' His house, called Danvers House, adjoined the mansion, once the home of Sir Thomas More, which was known in the seventeenth century as Buckingham and also as Beaufort House.http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=74622 Danvers House was pulled down in 1696 to make room for Danvers Street, therefore named after him. Through his second marriage he came into possession of the estate of Lavington,Either or both of the neighbouring villages of Market Lavington and West Lavington. Wiltshire, where he elaborately laid out gardens. Marriages and family In about March 1609 he married Magdalen Herbert (n√©e Newport), widow of Richard Herbert, and mother of ten children, including George Herbert the poet, and Edward, Lord Herbert of Cherbury. She died in 1627. On 10 July 1628, a year after the death of his first wife, Danvers, then aged 40, married Elizabeth, daughter of the late Ambrose Dauntsey, and granddaughter of Sir John Dauntsey. He lost his second wife on 9 July 1636. His family by his second wife consisted of Henry (b. 5 December 1633), who inherited much of his uncle Henry's property, and died before his father in November 1654, when Thomas Fuller is stated to have preached the funeral sermon; Charles, who died in infancy; Elizabeth (b. 1 May 1629), who married Robert Danvers, self-styled Viscount Purbeck; and Mary, who died in infancy. Danvers married a third time at Chelsea, on 6 January 1649, his wife being Grace Hewett, and he had by her a son, John (b. 10 August 1650). Danvers' elder brothers were Charles Danvers and Henry Danvers. His brother Henry, who became Lord Danby was a royalist, and died early in 1644; he left his property to his sister Lady Catherine Gargrave, wife of Sir Richard Gargrave, High Sheriff of Yorkshire. Still in pecuniary difficulties, Danvers resisted this disposition of his brother's property, and his influence with the parliamentary majority led the House of Commons to pass a resolution declaring that he had been deprived of his brother's estate 'for his affection and adhering to the parliament' (14 June 1644), and that Danvers's eldest son Henry was entitled to the property. The son Henry bequeathed the estate in his power to his sister Ann, who married Sir Henry Lee 3rd Baronet of the Lee Baronets of Ditchley in 1655, and had a daughter, Eleanor, wife of James Bertie, 1st Earl of Abingdon. Lord Abingdon thus ultimately came into possession of the property at Chelsea.

He is portrayed as the most important philosopher in the history of the planet Vulcan. During an Earth-like \\"modern age\\", when the Vulcans are technological but emotionally driven and violent, Surak founds a movement which reforms the Vulcan way of thinking and lifestyle and leads to the world of logically-reasoning and emotion-repressing Vulcans known from the TV series. This period in Vulcan history is referred to as the \\"Time of Awakening\\". The \\"Time of Awakening\\" is accompanied by violence unmatched in Vulcan history, according to the Star Trek: Enterprise episode \\"Awakening\\" (wherein Surak's mind is resurrected 1,800 years after his death to restore to modern Vulcans an uncorrupted version of his original philosophy.) During the \\"Time of Awakening\\" a Vulcan schism of those who \\"sought a return to savage ways\\" and \\"marched beneath the raptor's wings\\" (later the symbol of the Romulan people) perpetrate a cataclysmic nuclear attack upon Surak and his enlightened society. Soon after Surak's death, these Vulcan recidivists abandon their homeworld to colonize the planets Romulus and Remus. The old society would come to be known as the Romulan Star Empire‚Äîwhere Surak's philosophy of peace and logic survives only as an underground movement within their emotional, warlike society for the next 2,000 years (until further shepherded, in the Next Generation episode \\"Unification\\", by the elderly Ambassador Spock in the role of a latter-day successor to Surak), while flourishing on Vulcan to become its predominant philosophy. The \\"Time of Awakening\\" and its \\"ironic violence\\" noted by Surak, which ends in nuclear holocaust but philosophical maturity, was written by Star Trek creators with intentional parallels to modern human society‚Äîparticularly its historical progression toward cultural enlightenment, reason and tolerance interrupted by extreme bouts of cultural regression, irrationalism and fanatical violence. Depiction Bruce Gray as Surak observing Vulcan's nuclear holocaust. The character of Surak in the Star Trek television series backstory, after up- ending the Vulcan people's violent tribalism with a philosophy of communal commitment to reason and logic, dies in the 4th century AD (based upon Earth's calendar, approximately 1,800 years before the events of the Star Trek: Enterprise episode \\"Awakening\\"), apparently of radiation poisoning caused by a nuclear attack that devastates Vulcan. His spirit, or katra, is transferred into a crystalline urn which remains entombed and undisturbed until its rediscovery after two millennia by a Vulcan character, Syrran, in the 22nd century. Syrran places Surak's katra within his own mind, which leads Syrran to create a group called Syrranites dedicated to returning Vulcan civilization to the true teachings of Surak. A decade later, in 2154 prior to the outbreak of impending Vulcan civil war, Syrran is killed while escorting the characters of Captain Jonathan Archer and T'Pol to his group's headquarters in the Vulcan Forge. Before dying of his wounds, Syrran places Surak's katra into Archer's mind. Experiencing a hallucination (or vision), Archer finds himself conversing with Surak within his own mind. Together, they witness the nuclear explosion that had occurred on Vulcan 1,800 years earlier, causing Surak's apparent death by radiation poisoning. It is implied that those elements responsible for setting off the nuclear attack are a splinter group of Vulcans that reject Surak's philosophy and go on to form the Romulan Empire. A subsequent attempt to transfer Surak's katra to Syrran's second-in-command, T'Pau, fails when Surak chooses to remain merged with Jonathan Archer. Once again conversing with Archer inside his mind, Surak instructs him to recover an artifact called the Kir'Shara, which Surak claims will unite the warring factions on latter-day Vulcan. It is unscripted whether Surak himself creates this artifact, or whether it is later created by other Vulcans who carry his katra. The Kir'Shara is a holographic projector of the philosopher's original, long-lost testament‚Äîcapable of restoring Vulcan society to the \\"true path\\" of non-violence and logic. Archer and T'Pau succeed in taking the artifact to the corrupt Vulcan High Command in the Star Trek: Enterprise episode \\"Kir'Shara\\", resulting in its overthrow. Surak's katra is subsequently transferred into the mind of an elderly Vulcan priest; what becomes of his katra afterwards in the Star Trek backstory is, as yet, unscripted. Star Trek author Diane Duane explored Surak's backstory from the character's own perspective, in the novel Spock's World ‚Äì which depicts Surak's initial awakening and internet- dissemination of his philosophy after leaving his job as a computer programmer in response to a nuclear explosion from a war between mining conglomerates that spreads to T'Khut, Vulcan's \\"moon\\" (in reality, Vulcan's smaller binary planet). In the character's depicted internal struggle, Surak conquers his own xenophobia, becomes \\"awake\\" to the horrors of war, and develops the pluralistic rationalist philosophy of IDIC (\\"Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combinations\\") plus logic that ultimately brings peace to Vulcan. The character names of many latter-day Vulcan males begin with \\"S\\" and end in \\"k\\", perhaps to honor Surak, though some Vulcan character names do not fit this formula (e.g. Tuvok). A character representing a physical re-creation of the \\"historical Surak\\" in his youthful maturity‚Äîfashioned by advanced alien technology from telepathically-recorded recollections and expectations held by Mr. Spock, appears in the original Star Trek series episode \\"The Savage Curtain\\", and is portrayed by the actor Barry Atwater. The vision of a more elderly Surak appearing in the mind of the character of Captain Jonathan Archer is portrayed by the actor Bruce Gray. The only specific mention of the character of Surak in the 24th century period of the Star Trek saga is in the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episode \\"In the Cards\\", where the character of the Ferengi trader, Quark, hawks a bracelet \\"from the time of Surak\\". Cultural impact The fictional Surak's philosophy of rationalism with emotional mastery and its role as a cornerstone of Vulcan and Starfleet mythos has contributed a distinct philosophical component to the broader cultural influence of Star Trek. Similar to the anecdotal testimonies that Star Trek has inspired many of its viewers to become scientists or engineers,Trekkies (1997)Trekkies II (2004)Trek Nation (2006) other viewers have adopted Starfleet- or Surak-inspired personal philosophies and lifestylesThe Logic of Surak via the Wayback Machine and founded fan-based (such as STARFLEET International) or \\"IDIC plus logic\\" philosophy-inspired \\"pluralistic rationalist\\"The Circle of Reason\\"Orange Is the New Black Is the New Star Trek,\\" Katy Waldman, Slate, June 16, 2015.

The outbreaks may or may not be a direct result of inadequate cleaning or inappropriate cleaning methods. SBS has also been used to describe staff concerns in post- war brutalist-style buildings with defects in the construction materials or assembly process and-or inadequate maintenance. Certain symptoms tend to increase in severity with the time people spend in the building; often improving over time or even disappearing when people are away from the building. Exposure to toxic black mold might be a problem. SBS is also used interchangeably with \\"building-related symptoms\\", which orients the name of the condition around patients symptoms rather than a \\"sick\\" building. A 1984 World Health Organization (WHO) report suggested up to 30% of new and remodeled buildings worldwide may be subject of complaints related to poor indoor air quality. Other causes have been attributed to contaminants produced by outgassing of some types of building materials, volatile organic compounds (VOC), molds (see mold health issues), improper exhaust ventilation of ozone (byproduct of some office machinery), light industrial chemicals used within, or lack of adequate fresh-air intake/air filtration (see minimum efficiency reporting value). The main identifying observation is an increased incidence of complaints of symptoms such as headache, eye, nose, and throat irritation, fatigue, and dizziness and nausea. In fact the 1989 Oxford English Dictionary defines SBS in that way. The World Health Organization created a 484-page tome on indoor air quality back in 1984 when SBS was attributed only to non-organic causes, and suggested that the book might form a basis for legislation or litigation. A Swedish researcher named Th√∂rn states that \\"the case study methodology can contribute to a better understanding and management of sick building syndrome.\\" In the particular case that he studied, after many years the building itself was condemned. Sick building causes are frequently pinned down to flaws in the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. However, there have been inconsistent findings on whether air conditioning systems result in SBS or not. More recently, sick building was confirmed as a vector for the transmission of SARS in 2003. Norovirus has also been linked with buildings because of \\"the small inoculum required to produce infection (<100 viral particles), prolonged viral shedding, and its ability to survive in the environment.\\" Many cases of Norwalk virus and norovirus outbreak have been traced back to cruise ships with food service in unsanitary conditions, or filthy personal hygiene around the toilet. In many cases the building itself is too damaged to recover, as the materials themselves (wood structural members) are decaying from mold or rot. The phenomenon is found worldwide in buildings with lower than adequate maintenance or other economic concerns. Some health professionals recommend anyone living in an older building with medical conditions, to use HEPA air filters for indoor use to minimize airborne particulate introduced from outside the living space. Some symptoms are linked to the average amount of time spent in a building, such as mold spore and dust inhalation. Signs and symptoms Human exposure to aerosols has been documented to give rise to a variety of adverse health effects. Building occupants complain of symptoms such as sensory irritation of the eyes, nose, or throat; neurotoxic or general health problems; skin irritation; nonspecific hypersensitivity reactions; infectious diseases; and odor and taste sensations.Godish, Thad (2001). Indoor Environmental Quality. New York: CRC Press. pp. 196‚Äì197. Exposure to poor lighting conditions has led to general malaise. Extrinsic allergic alveolitis has been associated with the presence of fungi and bacteria in the moist air of residential houses and commercial offices. A very large 2017 Swedish study correlated several inflammatory diseases of the respiration tract with objective evidence of damp-caused damage in homes. The WHO has classified the reported symptoms into broad categories, including: mucous membrane irritation (eye, nose, and throat irritation), neurotoxic effects (headaches, fatigue, and irritability), asthma and asthma-like symptoms (chest tightness and wheezing), skin dryness and irritation, gastrointestinal complaints and more. Several sick occupants may report individual symptoms which do not appear to be connected. The key to discovery is the increased incidence of illnesses in general with onset or exacerbation within a fairly close time frame ‚Äì usually within a period of weeks. In most cases, SBS symptoms will be relieved soon after the occupants leave the particular room or zone. However, there can be lingering effects of various neurotoxins, which may not clear up when the occupant leaves the building. In some cases ‚Äì particularly in sensitive individuals ‚Äì there can be long-term health effects. Cause ASHRAE has recognized that polluted urban air, designated within the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)'s air quality ratings as unacceptable requires the installation of treatment such as filtration for which the HVAC practitioners generally apply carbon-impregnated filters and their likes. Different toxins will aggravate the human body in different ways. Some people are more allergic to mold, while others are highly sensitive to dust. Inadequate ventilation will exaggerate small problems (such as deteriorating fiberglass insulation or cooking fumes) into a much more serious indoor air quality problem. Common products such as paint, insulation, rigid foam, Particle Board, plywood, duct liners, exhaust fumes and other chemical contaminants from indoor or outdoor sources, and biological contaminants can be trapped inside by the HVAC AC system. As this air is recycled using fan coils the overall oxygenation ratio drops and becomes harmful. When combined with other stress factors such as traffic noise, poor lighting, inhabitants of buildings located in a polluted urban area can quickly become ill as their immune system is overwhelmed. Certain VOCs, considered toxic chemical contaminants to humans, are used as adhesives in all common building construction products. These aromatic carbon rings / VOCs can cause acute and chronic health effects on the occupants of a building, including cancer, paralysis, lung failure, and others. Bacterial spores, fungal spores, mold spores, pollen, and viruses are types of biological contaminants and can all cause allergic reactions or illness described as SBS. In addition, pollution from outdoors, such as motor vehicle exhaust, can infiltrate into poorly designed buildings and contribute to poor indoor air quality, high ppm of CO and CO2. Adult SBS symptoms were associated with a history of allergic rhinitis, eczema and asthma. A 2015 study concerning the association of SBS and indoor air pollutants in office buildings in Iran found that, as carbon dioxide levels increase in a building, symptoms like nausea, headaches, nasal irritation, dyspnea, and throat dryness have also been shown to increase. Certain work conditions have been found to be correlated with specific symptoms. For example, higher light intensity was significantly related to skin dryness, eye pain, and malaise. Higher temperature has also been found to correlate with symptoms such as sneezing, skin redness, itchy eyes and headache, while higher relative humidity has been associated with sneezing, skin redness, and pain of the eyes. In 1973, in response to the oil crisis and conservation concerns, ASHRAE Standards 62-73 and 62-81 reduced required ventilation from per person to per person, but this was found to be a contributing factor to sick building syndrome. in section 3 \\"Inadequate ventilation\\". As of the 2016 revision, ASHRAE ventilation standards call for 5 to 10 cubic feet per minute of ventilation per occupant (depending on the occupancy type) in addition to ventilation based on the zone floor area delivered to the breathing zone.ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2016. =Psychological factors= One study looked at commercial buildings and their employees, comparing some environmental factors suspected of inducing SBS to a self-reported survey of the occupants,Taken from another study: Whitehead II. finding that the measured psycho-social circumstances appeared more influential than the tested environmental factors. Limitations of the study include that it only measured the indoor environment of commercial buildings, which have different building codes than residential buildings, and that the assessment of building environment was based on layman observation of a limited number of factors. Research has shown that SBS shares several symptoms common in other conditions thought to be at least partially caused by psychosomatic tendencies. The umbrella term \\"autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants\\" has been suggested. Other members of the suggested group include Silicosis, Macrophagic myofascitis, Gulf War syndrome, Post- vaccination phenomena.The sick building syndrome as a part of the autoimmune (auto-inflammatory) syndrome induced by adjuvants. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov]. = Workplace = Greater effects were found with features of the psycho-social work environment including high job demands and low support. The report concluded that the physical environment of office buildings appears to be less important than features of the psycho-social work environment in explaining differences in the prevalence of symptoms. However, there is still a relationship between sick building syndrome and symptoms of workers regardless of workplace stress. Excessive work stress or dissatisfaction, poor interpersonal relationships and poor communication are often seen to be associated with SBS, recent studies show that a combination of environmental sensitivity and stress can greatly contribute to sick building syndrome. Specific work-related stressors are related with specific SBS symptoms. Workload and work conflict are significantly associated with general symptoms (headache, abnormal tiredness, sensation of cold or nausea). While crowded workspaces and low work satisfaction are associated with upper respiratory symptoms. Specific careers are also associated with specific SBS symptoms. Transport, communication, healthcare, and social workers have highest prevalence of general symptoms. Skin symptoms such as eczema, itching, and rashes on hands and face are associated with technical work. Forestry, agriculture, and sales workers have the lowest rates of sick building syndrome symptoms. Milton et al. determined the cost of sick leave specific for one business was an estimated $480 per employee, and about five days of sick leave per year could be attributed to low ventilation rates. When comparing low ventilation rate areas of the building to higher ventilation rate areas, the relative risk of short-term sick leave was 1.53 times greater in the low ventilation areas. Work productivity has been associated with ventilation rates, a contributing factor to SBS, and there's a significant increase in production as ventilation rates increase, by 1.7% for every two-fold increase of ventilation rate. Printer effluent, released into the office air as ultra- fine particles (UFPs) as toner is burned during the printing process, may lead to certain SBS symptoms. Printer effluent may contain a variety of toxins to which a subset of office workers are sensitive, triggering SBS symptoms.McKone, Thomas, et al. \\"Indoor Pollutant Emissions from Electronic Office Equipment, California Air Resources Board Air Pollution Seminar Series\\". Presented January 7, 2009. https://www.arb.ca.gov/research/seminars/mckone/mckone.pdf = Home = Sick building syndrome can also occur due to factors of the home. Laminate flooring can cause more exposure to chemicals and more resulting SBS symptoms compared to stone, tile, and cement flooring. Recent redecorating and new furnishings within the last year were also found to be associated with increased symptoms, along with dampness and related factors, having pets, and the presence of cockroaches. The presence of mosquitoes was also a factor related to more symptoms, though it is unclear whether it was due to the presence of mosquitoes or the use of repellents.  Diagnosis  While sick building syndrome (SBS) encompasses a multitude of non-specific symptoms, building- related illness (BRI) comprises specific, diagnosable symptoms caused by certain agents (chemicals, bacteria, fungi, etc.). These can typically be identified, measured, and quantified. There are usually 4 causal agents in BRI; 1.) Immunologic, 2.) Infectious, 3.) toxic, and 4.) irritant. For instance, Legionnaire's disease, usually caused by Legionella pneumophila, involves a specific organism which could be ascertained through clinical findings as the source of contamination within a building.  Management  SBS, as a non specific blanket term, does not have any specific cause or cure. Any known cure would be associated with the specific eventual disease that was cause by exposure to known contaminants. In all cases, alleviation consists of removing the affected person from the building associated. BRI, on the other hand, utilizes treatment appropriate for the contaminant identified within the building (e.g., antibiotics for Legionnaire's disease). In most cases, simply improving the indoor air quality (IAQ) of a particular building will attenuate, or even eliminate, the continued exposure to toxins. For the individual, the recovery may be a process involved with targeting the acute symptoms of a specific illness, as in the case of mold toxins.Indoor Air Facts No. 4 (revised) Sick building syndrome. Available from: https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2014-08/documents/sick_building_factsheet.pdf. Treating various building-related illnesses is vital to the overall understanding of SBS. Careful analysis by certified building professionals and Medical Doctors can help to identify the exact cause of the BRI, and help to illustrate a causal path to infection. With this knowledge one can, theoretically, remediate a building of contaminants and rebuild the structure with new materials. Office BRI may more likely than not be explained by three events: \\"Wide range in the threshold of response in any population (susceptibility), a spectrum of response to any given agent, or variability in exposure within large office buildings.\\" Isolating any one of the three aspects of office BRI can be a great challenge, which is why those who find themselves with BRI should take three steps, history, examinations, and interventions. History describes the action of continually monitoring and recording the health of workers experiencing BRI, as well as obtaining records of previous building alterations or related activity. Examinations go hand in hand with monitoring employee health. This step is done by physically examining the entire workspace and evaluating possible threats to health status among employees. Interventions follow accordingly based on the results of the Examination and History report.

However, many other studies have shown an even higher difference in the report of sick building syndrome symptoms in women compared to men. It is not entirely clear, however, if this is due to biological, social, or occupational factors. A 2001 study published in the Journal Indoor Air, gathered 1464 office-working participants to increase the scientific understanding of gender differences under the Sick Building Syndrome phenomenon. Using questionnaires, ergonomic investigations, building evaluations, as well as physical, biological, and chemical variables, the investigators obtained results that compare with past studies of SBS and gender. The study team found that across most test variables, prevalence rates were different in most areas, but there was also a deep stratification of working conditions between genders as well. For example, men‚Äôs workplace tend to be significantly larger and have all around better job characteristics. Secondly, there was a noticeable difference in reporting rates, finding that women have higher rates of reporting roughly 20% higher than men. This information was similar to that found in previous studies, indicating a potential difference in willingness to report. There might be a gender difference in reporting rates of sick building syndrome because women tend to report more symptoms than men do. Along with this, some studies have found that women have a more responsive immune system and are more prone to mucosal dryness and facial erythema. Also, women are alleged by some to be more exposed to indoor environmental factors because they have a greater tendency to have clerical jobs, wherein they are exposed to unique office equipment and materials (example: blueprint machines), whereas men often have jobs based outside of offices.Godish, Thad (2001). Indoor Environmental quality. New York: CRC Press. pp. 196‚Äì197. History In the late 1970s, it was noted that nonspecific symptoms were reported by tenants in newly constructed homes, offices, and nurseries. In media it was called \\"office illness\\". The term \\"sick building syndrome\\" was coined by the WHO in 1986, when they also estimated that 10‚Äì30% of newly built office buildings in the West had indoor air problems. Early Danish and British studies reported symptoms. Poor indoor environments attracted attention. The Swedish allergy study (SOU 1989:76) designated \\"sick building\\" as a cause of the allergy epidemic as was feared. In the 1990s, therefore, extensive research into \\"sick building\\" was carried out. Various physical and chemical factors in the buildings were examined on a broad front. The problem was highlighted increasingly in media and was described as a \\"ticking time bomb\\". Many studies were performed in individual buildings. In the 1990s \\"sick buildings\\" were contrasted against \\"healthy buildings\\". The chemical contents of building materials were highlighted. Many building material manufacturers were actively working to gain control of the chemical content and to replace criticized additives. The ventilation industry advocated above all more well-functioning ventilation. Others perceived ecological construction, natural materials, and simple techniques as a solution. At the end of the 1990s came an increased distrust of the concept of \\"sick building\\". A dissertation at the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm 1999 questioned the methodology of previous research, and a Danish study from 2005 showed these flaws experimentally. It was suggested that sick building syndrome was not really a coherent syndrome and was not a disease to be individually diagnosed, but a collection of as many as to dozen semi related diseases. In 2006 the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare recommended in the medical journal L√§kartidningen that \\"sick building syndrome\\" should not be used as a clinical diagnosis. Thereafter, it has become increasingly less common to use terms such as \\"sick buildings\\" and \\"sick building syndrome\\" in research. However, the concept remains alive in popular culture and is used to designate the set of symptoms related to poor home or work environment engineering. \\"Sick building\\" is therefore an expression used especially in the context of workplace health. Sick building syndrome made a rapid journey from media to courtroom where professional engineers and architects became named defendants and were represented by their respective professional practice insurers. Proceedings invariably relied on expert witnesses, medical and technical experts along with building managers, contractors and manufacturers of finishes and furnishings, testifying as to cause and effect. Most of these actions resulted in sealed settlement agreements, none of these being dramatic. The insurers needed a defense based upon Standards of Professional Practice to meet a court decision that declared that in a modern, essentially sealed building, the HVAC systems must produce breathing air for suitable human consumption. ASHRAE (American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Engineers, currently with over 50,000 international members) undertook the task of codifying its indoor air quality (IAQ) standard. ASHRAE empirical research determined that \\"acceptability\\" was a function of outdoor (fresh air) ventilation rate and used carbon dioxide as an accurate measurement of occupant presence and activity. Building odors and contaminants would be suitably controlled by this dilution methodology. ASHRAE codified a level of 1,000 ppm of carbon dioxide and specified the use of widely available sense-and-control equipment to assure compliance. The 1989 issue of ASHRAE 62.1-1989 published the whys and wherefores and overrode the 1981 requirements that were aimed at a ventilation level of 5,000 ppm of carbon dioxide, (the OAHA workplace limit), federally set to minimize HVAC system energy consumption. This apparently ended the SBS epidemic. Over time, building materials changed with respect to emissions potential. Smoking vanished and dramatic improvements in ambient air quality, coupled with code compliant ventilation and maintenance, per ASHRAE standards have all contributed to the acceptability of the indoor air environment. Only time and the courts will tell how right, or wrong ASHRAE is.

She first appeared in the film Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (1982) played by Kirstie Alley. Robin Curtis took over the role for Star Trek III: The Search for Spock (1984) and Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home (1986).  Fictional biography  Saavik's background was never explored on screen. It has, however, been fleshed out in novels and comic books, though none of these sources is considered canon. According to the novels and comics, Saavik was born on Hellguard, an abandoned Romulan colony, and is half Vulcan and half Romulan.McIntyre, Vonda N. (1982). Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, Pocket Books. A line of dialogue that would have revealed this in The Wrath of Khan was edited out prior to the film's release and never restored; as a result, the canonicity of this piece of information has been debated for more than two decades. Saavik's mixed parentage is referenced often in her appearances in Star Trek novels. However, if Saavik's mixed ancestry were to be made canon, it would violate the continuity created by the Star Trek: The Original Series episode \\"Balance of Terror\\" (which takes place after Saavik's birth) in which Starfleet learns for the first time that Romulans resemble Vulcans, a fact that appears to be unknown to Vulcans (or at least the extremely knowledgeable Mr. Spock) as well. Some non-canon novels, however, hold that at least some Vulcans were fully aware of the Romulans' heritage, but deliberately concealed that knowledge from the Federation, considering it an embarrassing internal affair that should not be revealed to their allies. The TV series Star Trek: Enterprise established in canon that some factions of the Vulcan government were aware of the connection as early as the 22nd century. (There has also been some debate about whether Spock rescued the child Saavik before or after the events that occurred during \\"Balance of Terror\\". A rescue occurring after the episode would not be in conflict with the Vulcans' knowledge of Romulans.) A few sources have her (non-canon) origin story aligned to original material found in the film's novelization,McIntyre, Vonda N. (1982). Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, Pocket Books. as follows: she was rescued from the colony, along with other children, by Spock, and she was cared for by his parents Ambassador Sarek and Amanda Grayson. Following in the footsteps of her mentor, Spock, she entered Starfleet Academy. In the non-canon 1990 novel The Pandora Principle, written by Carolyn Clowes, it is established that four Vulcan research ships were captured by Romulans. Their Vulcan crews were abducted by Romulan scientists and their fertility was manipulated to produce half- Romulan, half-Vulcan children such as Saavik to use in mind control experiments. Vulcan scientists learned of the experiments and mounted a secret rescue of Saavik and other child survivors on Hellguard. Spock threatened to reveal the story to Federation authorities and along with it the secret of the Vulcan mating cycle pon farr if the survivors were denied Vulcan citizenship. Other members of the party wanted to educate them elsewhere and send the children to live on worlds other than Vulcan. Clowes writes that Saavik's name is of Romulan origin and translates as \\"little cat\\". In The Pandora Principle, Saavik, unlike the other half-Vulcan, half-Romulan child survivors, refuses a DNA test that would identify her Vulcan relatives. Instead, Spock, who has established a bond with her, takes a year of personal leave to \\"civilize\\" and educate the 9- or 10-year-old Saavik. She then lives off Vulcan with foster families or at boarding schools chosen by Spock until she is accepted into the Starfleet Academy as a teenager.Clowes, Carolyn (1990). Star Trek: The Pandora Principle, Pocket Books. This agrees with the Star Trek III: The Search for Spock novelization which said Saavik has never been to Vulcan until then.McIntyre, Vonda N. (1984). Star Trek III: The Search for Spock, Pocket Books. After graduating, as a fresh Lieutenant Saavik was on her cadet cruise on the USS Enterprise with Admiral James T. Kirk and Captain Spock when Kirk's old enemy Khan Noonien Singh sought revenge for the failure of the Ceti Alpha V colony and the death of his wife, Marla McGivers, and attacked the Enterprise. Spock died while saving the Enterprise during the events of Wrath of Khan, but before his death transferred his katra to Dr. Leonard McCoy. His coffin was fired from the Enterprise in orbit around the Genesis Planet and was believed to have been destroyed in the atmosphere. A rare expression of emotion by a Vulcan is displayed when Saavik is seen shedding a tear during the eulogy for Spock by Kirk. Saavik and David Marcus (son of Admiral James T. Kirk), subsequently were assigned to the research vessel USS Grissom to study the newly formed Genesis Planet. During this mission, Saavik discovered that Spock had somehow been regenerated, and was rapidly aging. As the new Spock entered his teenage years, he began experiencing the mating drive known as pon farr, and Saavik helped Spock through this difficult time. When the Klingon commander Kruge and his men captured the landing party the next day, David sacrificed his life to save Saavik from being executed. Saavik helped Admiral Kirk return Spock to Vulcan, where his body and katra were reunited. Afterwards, she remained on Vulcan with Spock's family for reasons never explained on screen; the film's writers intended that this was because she was pregnant with Spock's child as a result of the pon farr, but no references to her pregnancy made it into the finished movie and it was never followed up, thereby once again placing this development into a grey area in terms of canon. Before the Enterprise crew departed Vulcan Saavik told Captain Kirk how his son had died bravely, sacrificing himself to save both Spock and herself.  Unrealized concepts  The role of Saavik in Star Trek III went to Robin Curtis. Saavik was at one point to appear in the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode, \\"Cause and Effect\\" in a scene in which the Enterprise-D encounters a starship that had been trapped in a time anomaly for some 80 years. The idea was dropped when Kirstie Alley insisted on being paid more for a nonspeaking cameo part than the episode budget could supply. (Saavik was to have been shown standing alongside a character played by Kelsey Grammer, Alley's Cheers co-star.)Nemecek, Larry (2003). Star Trek: The Next Generation Companion. Pocket Books. . The character of Saavik was originally intended to appear in Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, which would have revealed her as a traitor to the Federation. The idea of using an established character was dropped and a new character, Valeris, was created instead.Gross, Edward, ed., (1995) The Making of the Trek Films, 3rd ed., Image Publishing, p. 106 According to director Nicholas Meyer, writing in his autobiography, The View from the Bridge, Saavik was dropped from the film and Valeris created when Kirstie Alley proved unwilling to reprise the role,Meyer, Nicholas (2009), The View from the Bridge: Memories of Star Trek and a Life in Hollywood, Plume, pp. 203 & 212. while Leonard Nimoy, in his autobiography I Am Spock, said there were also second thoughts about casting a popular, established character as a villain.Nimoy, Leonard (1995), I Am Spock, Hyperion, p. 319. Saavik, however, does appear in the novelization of the film, as a recruiting officer who inspires Valeris to join Starfleet, and offers some insights on how to deal with a dual heritage.  Other appearances and Next Generation continuity  In the novel Vulcan's Heart,Sherman, Josepha & Shwartz, Susan (1999). Star Trek: Vulcan's Heart, Pocket Books. which takes place some years after Undiscovered Country, an older Saavik marries Spock. Saavik appears again in the Vulcan's Soul trilogy of novels published from 2004. In this continuity, the character has risen to the rank of Captain.Sherman, Josepha & Shwartz, Susan (2004). Star Trek: Vulcan's Soul: Exodus, Pocket Books. In the Titan novel, Taking Wing, it is clearly stated that Spock and Saavik are married, as she sends greetings through Tuvok.Martin, Michael A. & Mangels, Andy (2005). Star Trek: Titan: Taking Wing, Pocket Books. Star Trek books are not considered part of the established canon. In the \\"Mirror Universe Saga\\" trilogy of novels written by William Shatner, it is revealed that the Mirror Universe's Intendant Spock had a daughter named T'Val with Mirror Saavik.Shatner, William with Reeves-Stevens, Judith & Reeves-Stevens, Garfield (1998). Star Trek: Spectre, Pocket Books. Kirstie Alley did play Saavik one other time, in a play that was set between The Wrath of Khan and The Search for Spock, \\"The Machiavellian Principle\\" written by Walter Koenig for the ambitious \\"Ultimate Fantasy\\" convention. It also starred DeForest Kelley, James Doohan, Mark Lenard (not as Sarek), Walter Koenig, Nichelle Nichols and George Takei, with a walk-on role by William Shatner as \\"the Admiral\\". The short script was eventually published by Creation Conventions in a booklet about Koenig's career, called \\"Through the Looking Glass\\". It misspells the name in the cast list as \\"Savik\\".Koenig, Walter (1987), Through the Looking Glass, Creation Conventions.  Early reference  Samuel A. Peeples' unused script, Worlds That Never Were, for the second Star Trek film, had a male character called \\"Doctor Savik\\", who eventually was morphed into the female Lieutenant Saavik.Peeples, Samuel A., Worlds That Never Were unused script.

He survived impeachment by the 5th Majlis which was dominated by the conservatives in part with a \\"daring\\" speech defending the principle of freedom of speech in Islamic rather than Western terms.

He was a member and a founder of Executives of Construction Party, which is considered a backer of Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.
