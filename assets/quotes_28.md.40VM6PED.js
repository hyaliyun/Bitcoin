It states that whatever energy a person puts out into the world, be it positive or negative, will be returned to that person three times. Some subscribe to a variant of this law in which return is not necessarily threefold. The Rule of Three is sometimes described as karma by Wiccans; however, this is not strictly accurate. Both concepts describe the process of cause and effect and often encourage the individual to act in an upright way. In Hindu Vedanta literature, there is a comparable idea of threefold Karma referred to as Sanchita (accumulated works), Kriyamana, Agami, or Vartamana (current works), and Prarabdha (fructifying works), which are associated with past, present and future respectively. According to some traditions, the rule of three is not literal but symbolizes that our energy returns our way as many times as needed for us to learn the lesson associated with it.Witch School First Degree: Lessons in the Correllian Tradition (Witch School) by Rev. Donald Lewis-Highcorrell () According to occult author/researcher John Coughlin, the Law posits \\"a literal reward or punishment tied to one's actions, particularly when it comes to working magic\\".Coughlin, John J. (2001) The Three-fold Law, on his website; updated edition published in his book Ethics and the Craft - The History, Evolution, and Practice of Wiccan Ethics (Waning Moon, 2015). The law is not a universal article of faith among Wiccans, and \\"there are many Wiccans, experienced and new alike, who view the Law of Return as an over-elaboration on the Wiccan Rede.\\" Some Wiccans believe that it is a modern innovation based on Christian morality.Spiro, Guy (September 2001). \\"A Conversation With Phyllis Curott\\", The Monthly Aspectarian.Lembke, Karl (2002), The Threefold Law . Retrieved 8 December 2006. The Rule of Three has been compared by Karl Lembke to other ethics of reciprocity, such as the concept of karma in Dharmic religions and the Golden Rule The Rule of Three has a possible prototype in a piece of Wiccan liturgy which first appeared in print in Gerald Gardner's 1949 novel High Magic's Aid:Coughlin, John J. (2001) The Three-fold Law, part 3: Rise of the Three-fold Law However, The Threefold Law as an actual \\"law\\", was an interpretation of Wiccan ideas and ritual, made by noted witch Monique Wilson (1923-1982) and further popularized by Raymond Buckland, in his books on Wicca. Prior to this innovation by Wilson and its subsequent inclusion in publications, Wiccan ideas of reciprocal ethics were far less defined and more often interpreted as a kind of general karma. Raymond Buckland made a reference to an ethical threefold law in a 1968 article for Beyond magazine. The Rule of Three later features within a poem of 26 couplets titled \\"Rede of the Wiccae\\", published by Lady Gwen Thompson in 1975 in Green Egg vol. 8, no. 69The Rede of the Wiccae.

The threefold rule is referenced often by the Wiccans of the Clan Mackenzie in the S.M. Stirling Emberverse novels. This rule was described by the Dutch metal band Nemesea, in the song \\"Threefold Law\\", from the album Mana.  Anthroposophy  Though much closer to Rosicrucianism than Wicca, Rudolf Steiner's \\"spiritual science\\" or \\"anthroposophy\\" includes a type of threefold law. This is not, however, a theory of power. In Anthroposophy, the focus is on gaining the supersensible insight to bring spiritual power to any natural area of human endeavor like art, education, business, or politics - and also less obviously practical human pursuits like religion or philosophy. Steiner lays out this theory in a fairly comprehensive way in his 1904 book, \\"Knowledge of Higher Worlds and its Attainment.\\" In chapter two, \\"The Stages of Initiation,\\" he states the threefold law as follows. \\"...Once the student has found the beginnings of spiritual vision by means of such exercises, he may proceed to the contemplation of man himself. Simple phenomena of human life must first be chosen. But before making any attempt in this direction it is imperative for the student to strive for the absolute purity of his moral character. He must banish all thought of ever using knowledge gained in this way for his own personal benefit. He must be convinced that he would never, under any circumstances, avail himself in an evil sense of any power he may gain over his fellow-creatures. For this reason, all who seek to discover through personal vision the secrets in human nature must follow the golden rule of true spiritual science. This golden rule is as follows: For every one step that you take in the pursuit of higher knowledge, take three steps in the perfection of your own character.\\" (Knowledge of Higher Worlds and its Attainment, 1904) (http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA010/English/AP1947/GA010_c02.html The focus of the law is not on any obvious consequences to the practitioner; it's more of a natural law. Without having taken the requisite steps, one will not be able to make an advance into true knowledge. One may get some results, but those results are likely to be delusions, into which one can fall at any time. Notes  Further reading  * Coughlin, John J. (2001).

In 1949, three major cases against American communists started: that of Coplon (1949‚Äì1967), that of Alger Hiss and Whittaker Chambers (1949‚Äì1950), and that of the Smith Act trials of Communist Party leaders (1949‚Äì1958). Background Judith Coplon was born on May 17, 1921, in Brooklyn, New York. Her father Samuel Coplon was a toymaker and mother Rebecca Moroh a milliner. She went to public school Joseph F. Lamb (PS 206) in Brooklyn, New York. In high school she won an award for a good-citizenship award and a full scholarship to Barnard College. At Barnard, she majored in history and joined the Young Communist League. In 1943, she graduated cum laude. She was recruited for Soviet espionage at Columbia University by Flora Wovschin along with Marion Davis Berdecio Career In 1944, Coplon obtained a job in the US Department of Justice.. She transferred to the Foreign Agents Registration section, where she had access to counter-intelligence information, and was allegedly recruited as a spy by the NKGB at the end of 1944. =Espionage= Evidence later emerged that Coplon was recruited as a Soviet spy during the early months of 1945. Coplon had a meeting with Vladimir Pravdin, the NKVD station chief in New York City on January 4, 1945. Pravdin was impressed by Coplon who was described as \\"very serious, shy, profound girl, ideologically close to us.\\" He went on to argue: > We have no doubts about the sincerity of her desire to work with us. In the > course of the conversation (Coplon) underlined how much she appreciated the > credit we gave to her and that, now knowing for whom she was working, she > would redouble her efforts. At the very first stage of her work (Coplon) > thought she was helping the local compatriots (the CPUSA).... She thought > the stuff acquired by her couldn't represent an interest to the compatriots > but could for an organization like the Comintern or another institution > bearing a relationship to us. She added that she hoped she was working > specifically for us, since she considered it the highest honor to have an > opportunity to provide us with modest help.\\"Vladimir Pravdin, report on > Judith Coplon (January 8, 1945) Soon she was recruited as a Soviet spy (codenamed Sima).Athan Theoharis, Chasing Spies (2002) page 46 Coplon became one of the NKVD's most valued sources. Her main attention was focused on the main Justice Department counterintelligence archive that collected information from the various government agencies: FBI, OSS, and naval and army intelligence. She passed to her NKVD contact a number of documents from the archive. That included FBI materials on Soviet organizations in the United States and information on leaders of the Communist Party of the United States. =Detection= FBI arrests Judith Coplon on March 4, 1949 She came to the attention of the FBI as a result of a Venona message in late 1948. Coplon was known in both Soviet intelligence and the Venona files as \\"SIMA.\\" She was the first person tried as a result of the Venona project, but for reasons of security, the Venona information was not revealed at her trial. FBI Special Agent Robert Lamphere testified at her trial that suspicion had fallen on Coplon because of information from a reliable \\"confidential informant.\\" An extensive counterintelligence operation planted a secret document for her to pass to the Soviets. FBI agents arrested Coplon on March 4, 1949, in Manhattan, as she met with Valentin Gubitchev, a KGB official employed by the United Nations while she was carrying what she believed to be secret US government documents in her purse. =Trials and appeals= Coplon's attorney was Archibald Palmer and Gubitchev's was Abraham Pomerantz. Coplon was convicted in two separate trials, one for espionage that began on April 25, 1949 and another for conspiracy along with Gubitchev in 1950. Both convictions were later overturned, in 1950 and 1951 respectively, on appeal. The appellate court, sitting in New York, concluded that while the evidence showed that she was guilty, FBI agents had lied under oath about the bugging. Moreover, the opinion said that the failure to get a warrant was not justified. The court overturned the verdict, but the indictment was not dismissed. In the appeal of the Washington trial, the verdict was upheld, but because of the possible bugging, a new trial became impossible. For political and evidentiary reasons, it never took place. The legal irregularities ensured that she was never retried, and the government ultimately dropped the case in 1967. =National attention= The Coplon trials commanded nationwide attention. After her arrest but before her trials, Coplon received earnest attention from the media. For example, Gertrude Samuels wrote for The New York Times, questioning the situation: > Why do some people become traitors? What turns some native-born Americans, > as well as naturalized citizens, into Benedict Arnolds and Quislings? What > motivates them to betray their country and themselves?... Samuels examines four kinds of traitors: professional, people loyal to their birth lands, crackpots, and idealists. In this last group, she named Elizabeth Bentley and Whittaker Chambers. To understand this group, she argues, one must understand their drive for social justice‚Äîreasons \\"beyond FBI jurisdiction\\" while \\"few judges are bothered by motivations.\\" NYT Book Review editor Sam Tanenhaus wrote in March 2011: > At the time of her trial, Ms. Coplon drew a great deal of interest, > particularly in the lively tabloid press of the day. A 27-year-old cum laude > graduate of Barnard, employed in the internal security section of the > Justice Department, she seemed the model postwar \\"government girl,\\" > fetchingly clad in snug sweaters and New Look skirts . . [with the] sort of > attention Lindsay Lohan's courtroom appearances attract today. Personal life and death Coplon and Socolov 1950 In 1950 Coplon married one of her attorneys, Albert Socolov, and they remained married until her death in 2011. The couple had four children.

However, production of the Maxim did not end until 1945. In addition to the main infantry version, there were aircraft-mounted and naval variants. Some were fitted with a tractor radiator cap fitted on top of the water jacket to allow handfuls of snow to be packed in to melt while firing.

Its center lies on the inner normal line, and its curvature defines the curvature of the given curve at that point. This circle, which is the one among all tangent circles at the given point that approaches the curve most tightly, was named circulus osculans (Latin for \\"kissing circle\\") by Leibniz. The center and radius of the osculating circle at a given point are called center of curvature and radius of curvature of the curve at that point. A geometric construction was described by Isaac Newton in his Principia: Nontechnical description Imagine a car moving along a curved road on a vast flat plane. Suddenly, at one point along the road, the steering wheel locks in its present position. Thereafter, the car moves in a circle that \\"kisses\\" the road at the point of locking. The curvature of the circle is equal to that of the road at that point. That circle is the osculating circle of the road curve at that point. Mathematical description Let \\\\gamma(s) be a regular parametric plane curve, where s is the arc length (the natural parameter). This determines the unit tangent vector T(s), the unit normal vector N(s), the signed curvature k(s) and the radius of curvature R(s) at each point for which s is composed: : T(s)=\\\\gamma'(s),\\\\quad T'(s)=k(s)N(s),\\\\quad R(s)=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\leftk(s)\\\\right}. Suppose that P is a point on Œ≥ where k ‚â† 0. The corresponding center of curvature is the point Q at distance R along N, in the same direction if k is positive and in the opposite direction if k is negative. The circle with center at Q and with radius R is called the osculating circle to the curve Œ≥ at the point P. If C is a regular space curve then the osculating circle is defined in a similar way, using the principal normal vector N. It lies in the osculating plane, the plane spanned by the tangent and principal normal vectors T and N at the point P. The plane curve can also be given in a different regular parametrization \\\\gamma(t)\\\\,= \\\\, \\\\begin{pmatrix} x_1(t) \\\\\\\\\\\\ x_2(t) \\\\end{pmatrix}\\\\, where regular means that \\\\gamma'(t) e 0 for all t. Then the formulas for the signed curvature k(t), the normal unit vector N(t), the radius of curvature R(t), and the center Q(t) of the osculating circle are : k(t) = \\\\frac{x_1'(t) \\\\cdot x_2(t) - x_1(t) \\\\cdot x_2'(t)}{\\\\Big( x_1'(t)^2+x_2'(t)^2 \\\\Big)^{\\\\frac{3}{2}}} \\\\qquad\\\\qquad \\\\qquad\\\\qquad N(t)\\\\,=\\\\,\\\\frac{1}{\\\\ \\\\gamma'(t)\\\\}\\\\cdot\\\\begin{pmatrix} -x_2'(t) \\\\\\\\\\\\ x_1'(t) \\\\end{pmatrix} : R(t) = \\\\left \\\\frac{\\\\Big( x_1'(t)^2+x_2'(t)^2 \\\\Big)^{\\\\frac{3}{2}}}{x_1'(t) \\\\cdot x_2(t) - x_1(t) \\\\cdot x_2'(t)} \\\\right\\\\qquad\\\\qquad \\\\mathrm{and} \\\\qquad\\\\qquad Q(t)\\\\,=\\\\,\\\\gamma(t)\\\\,+ \\\\, \\\\frac{1}{k(t)\\\\cdot\\\\ \\\\gamma'(t)\\\\}\\\\cdot\\\\begin{pmatrix} -x_2'(t) \\\\\\\\\\\\ x_1'(t) \\\\end{pmatrix}\\\\,. = Cartesian coordinates = We can obtain the center of the osculating circle in Cartesian coordinates if we substitute t = x and y = f(x) for some _f_ function. If we do the calculations the results for the X and Y coordinates of the center of the osculating circle are: : x_c = x - f'\\\\frac{1 + f'^2}{f} \\\\qquad\\\\qquad\\\\text{and}\\\\qquad\\\\qquad y_c = f + \\\\frac{1 + f'^2}{f} Properties For a curve C given by a sufficiently smooth parametric equations (twice continuously differentiable), the osculating circle may be obtained by a limiting procedure: it is the limit of the circles passing through three distinct points on C as these points approach P.Actually, point P plus two additional points, one on either side of P will do. See Lamb (on line): This is entirely analogous to the construction of the tangent to a curve as a limit of the secant lines through pairs of distinct points on C approaching P. The osculating circle S to a plane curve C at a regular point P can be characterized by the following properties: * The circle S passes through P. * The circle S and the curve C have the common tangent line at P, and therefore the common normal line. * Close to P, the distance between the points of the curve C and the circle S in the normal direction decays as the cube or a higher power of the distance to P in the tangential direction. This is usually expressed as \\"the curve and its osculating circle have the second or higher order contact\\" at P. Loosely speaking, the vector functions representing C and S agree together with their first and second derivatives at P. If the derivative of the curvature with respect to s is nonzero at P then the osculating circle crosses the curve C at P. Points P at which the derivative of the curvature is zero are called vertices. If P is a vertex then C and its osculating circle have contact of order at least three. If, moreover, the curvature has a non-zero local maximum or minimum at P then the osculating circle touches the curve C at P but does not cross it. The curve C may be obtained as the envelope of the one-parameter family of its osculating circles. Their centers, i.e. the centers of curvature, form another curve, called the evolute of C. Vertices of C correspond to singular points on its evolute. Within any arc of a curve C within which the curvature is monotonic (that is, away from any vertex of the curve), the osculating circles are all disjoint and nested within each other. This result is known as the Tait-Kneser theorem. Examples =Parabola= The osculating circle of the parabola at its vertex has radius 0.5 and fourth order contact. For the parabola :\\\\gamma(t) = \\\\begin{pmatrix} t\\\\\\\\\\\\t^2 \\\\end{pmatrix} the radius of curvature is :R(t)= \\\\left \\\\frac{ \\\\left(1+4\\\\cdot t^2 \\\\right)^{\\\\frac{3}{2}}}{2} \\\\right At the vertex \\\\gamma(0) = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0\\\\\\\\\\\\0 \\\\end{pmatrix} the radius of curvature equals R(0)=0.5 (see figure). The parabola has fourth order contact with its osculating circle there. For large t the radius of curvature increases ~ t3, that is, the curve straightens more and more. =Lissajous curve= Animation of the osculating circle to a Lissajous curve A Lissajous curve with ratio of frequencies (3:2) can be parametrized as follows : \\\\gamma(t)\\\\,= \\\\, \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\cos(3t) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sin(2t) \\\\end{pmatrix}\\\\,. It has signed curvature k(t), normal unit vector N(t) and radius of curvature R(t) given by : k(t) = \\\\frac{6\\\\cos(t)(8(\\\\cos t)^4-10(\\\\cos t)^2+5)}{(232(\\\\cos t)^4-97(\\\\cos t)^2 + 13 - 144(\\\\cos t)^6)^{3/2}}\\\\,, : N(t)\\\\,=\\\\,\\\\frac{1}{\\\\ \\\\gamma'(t)\\\\}\\\\cdot\\\\begin{pmatrix} -2\\\\cos(2t) \\\\\\\\\\\\ -3\\\\sin(3t) \\\\end{pmatrix} and : R(t) = \\\\left \\\\frac{(232(\\\\cos t)^4-97(\\\\cos t)^2+13-144(\\\\cos t)^6)^{3/2}}{6\\\\cos(t)(8(\\\\cos t)^4-10(\\\\cos t)^2+5)} \\\\right\\\\,. See the figure for an animation. There the \\"acceleration vector\\" is the second derivative \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}^2\\\\gamma(s)}{\\\\mathrm{d}s^2} with respect to the arc length s. =Cycloid= Cycloid (blue), its osculating circle (red) and evolute (green). A cycloid with radius of r can be parametrized as follows: : \\\\gamma(t)\\\\,= \\\\, \\\\begin{pmatrix} r(t - \\\\sin t) \\\\\\\\\\\\ r(1 - \\\\cos t) \\\\end{pmatrix} Its curvature is given by the following formula: :\\\\kappa(t) = - \\\\frac{\\\\left \\\\csc \\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{2}t \\\\right) \\\\right}{4r} which gives: :R(t) = \\\\frac{4r}{\\\\left \\\\csc \\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{2}t \\\\right) \\\\right} See also *Circle packing theorem *Osculating curve *Osculating sphere Notes Further reading For some historical notes on the study of curvature, see For application to maneuvering vehicles see *JC Alexander and JH Maddocks (1988): On the maneuvering of vehicles * External links math3d : osculating_circle Category:Circles Category:Differential geometry Category:Curves ","title":"Osculating circle"},{"id":"1896708","text":"This is a list of composers of the Classical music era, roughly from 1730 to 1820.

civilisation. The New Yorker characterises her as \\"learned but accessible\\". She is Professor of Classics at the University of Cambridge, a fellow of Newnham College, and Royal Academy of Arts Professor of Ancient Literature. She is the Classics editor of The Times Literary Supplement, where she also writes a regular blog, \\"A Don's Life\\". Her frequent media appearances and sometimes controversial public statements have led to her being described as \\"Britain's best-known classicist.\\" Beard was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2013 New Year Honours and a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2018 Birthday Honours for services to the study of classical civilisations. Early life Mary Beard, an only child, was born on 1 January 1955 in Much Wenlock, Shropshire. Her mother, Joyce Emily Beard, was a headmistress and an enthusiastic reader. Her father, Roy Whitbread Beard, worked as an architect in Shrewsbury. She recalled him as \\"a raffish public-schoolboy type and a complete wastrel, but very engaging\\". Beard was educated at Shrewsbury High School, a girls' school then funded as a direct grant grammar school. She was taught poetry by Frank McEachran, the inspiration for schoolmaster Hector in Alan Bennett's play The History Boys. During the summer she would join archaeological excavations, though the motivation was, in part, just the prospect of earning some pocket- money. At eighteen she sat the then-compulsory entrance exam and interview for Cambridge University, to win a place at Newnham College, a single-sex college. She had considered King's, but rejected it when she learned the college did not offer scholarships to women. In Beard's first year she found that some men in the university still held very dismissive attitudes regarding the academic potential of women, which only strengthened her determination to succeed. She also developed feminist views that remained \\"hugely important\\" in her later life, although she later described \\"modern orthodox feminism\\" as partly cant. One of her tutors was Joyce Reynolds. Beard has since said that \\"Newnham could do better in making itself a place where critical issues can be generated\\" and has also described her views on feminism, saying \\"I actually can't understand what it would be to be a woman without being a feminist.\\" Beard has cited Germaine Greer's The Female Eunuch, Kate Millett's Sexual Politics, and Robert Munsch‚Äôs The Paper Bag Princess as influential on the development of her personal feminism. Beard graduated from Cambridge with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree: as per tradition, her BA was later promoted to a Master of Arts (MA Cantab) degree. She remained at Cambridge for her Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree: she completed it in 1982 with a doctoral thesis titled The State Religion in the Late Roman Republic: A Study Based on the Works of Cicero. Career Between 1979 and 1983, Beard lectured in Classics at King's College, London; she returned to Cambridge in 1984 as a Fellow of Newnham College and the only female lecturer in the Classics faculty. Rome in the Late Republic, which she co-wrote with Cambridge historian Michael Crawford, was published the following year. John Sturrock, Classics editor of The Times Literary Supplement, approached her for a review and brought her into literary journalism. Beard took over his role in 1992 at the request of Ferdinand Mount. In 1994 she made an early television appearance on an Open Media discussion for the BBC, Weird Thoughts, alongside Jenny Randles and James Randi among others. Shortly after the 11 September 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center, Beard was one of several authors invited to contribute articles on the topic to the London Review of Books. She opined that many people, once \\"the shock had faded\\", thought \\"the United States had it coming\\", and that \\"[w]orld bullies, even if their heart is in the right place, will in the end pay the price\\". In a November 2007 interview, she stated that the hostility these comments provoked had still not subsided, although she believed it had become a standard viewpoint that terrorism was associated with American foreign policy. By this point she was described by Paul Laity of The Guardian as \\"Britain's best-known classicist\\". In 2004, Beard became Professor of Classics at Cambridge. She was elected Visiting Sather Professor of Classical Literature for 2008‚Äì2009 at the University of California, Berkeley, where she delivered a series of lectures on \\"Roman Laughter\\". In 2007‚Äì2008 Beard gave the Sigmund H. Danziger Jr. Memorial Lecture in the Humanities at the University of Chicago. In December 2010, on BBC Two, Beard presented Pompeii: Life and Death in a Roman Town, submitting remains from the town to forensic tests, aiming to show a snapshot of the lives of the residents prior to the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 CE. (U.S. title: The Fires of Vesuvius: Pompeii Lost and Found, Harvard University Press) In 2011 she took part in a television series, Jamie's Dream School on Channel 4, in which she taught classics to teenagers with no experience of academic success. Beard is a regular contributor to the BBC Radio 4 series, A Point of View, delivering essays on a broad range of topics including Miss World and the Oxbridge interview. For BBC Two in 2012 she wrote and presented the three part television series, Meet the Romans with Mary Beard, which concerns how ordinary people lived in Rome, \\"the world's first global metropolis\\". The critic A. A. Gill reviewed the programme, writing mainly about her appearance (teeth, hair, and clothes), judging her \\"too ugly for television\\".John-Paul Ford Rojas \\"Mary Beard hits back at AA Gill after he brands her 'too ugly for television'\\", Daily Telegraph;, 24 April 2012 Beard admitted that his attack felt like a punch, but swiftly responded with a counter-attack on his intellectual abilities, accusing him of being part of \\"the blokeish culture that loves to decry clever women\\". This exchange became the focus of a debate about older women on the public stage, with Beard saying she looked an ordinary woman of her age and \\"there are kids who turn on these programmes and see there‚Äôs another way of being a woman\\", without Botox and hair dye. Charlotte Higgins assessed Beard as one of the rare academics who is both well respected by her peers and has a high profile in the media. Beard is known for being active on Twitter, which she sees as part of her public role as an academic. Beard received considerable online abuse after she appeared on BBC's Question Time from Lincolnshire in January 2013 and cast doubt on the negative rhetoric about immigrant workers living in the county. She asserted her right to express unpopular opinions and to present herself in public in a way she deemed authentic. On 4 August 2013, she received a bomb threat on Twitter, hours after the UK head of Twitter had apologised to women who had experienced abuse on the service. Beard said she did not think she was in physical danger, but considered it harassment and wanted to \\"make sure\\" that another case had been logged by the police. She has been praised for exposing \\"social media at its most revolting and misogynistic\\". In 2013 she presented Caligula with Mary Beard, describing the making of myths around leaders and dictators. Interviewers continued to ask about her self-presentation, and she reiterated that she had no intention of undergoing a make-over. On 14 February 2014 Beard delivered a lecture on the public voice of women at the British Museum as part of the London Review of Books winter lecture series. \\"Oh Do Shut Up, Dear!\\", shown on BBC Four a month later, started with the example of Telemachus, the son of Odysseus and Penelope, admonishing his mother to retreat to her chamber. (The title alludes to Prime Minister David Cameron telling a female MP to \\"Calm down, dear!\\", which earned wide-spread criticism as a \\"classic sexist put-down\\".) Three years later, Beard gave a second lecture for the same partners, entitled \\"Women in Power\\", from Medusa to Merkel. It considered the extent to which the exclusion of women from power is culturally embedded, and how idioms from ancient Greece are still used to normalise gendered violence. She argues that \\"we don‚Äôt have a model or a template for what a powerful woman looks like. We only have templates that make them men.\\" In December 2015, Beard was again a panellist on BBC's Question Time from Bath. During the programme, she praised Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn for behaving with a \\"considerable degree of dignity\\" against claims he faces an overly hostile media. She said: \\"Quite a lot of what Corbyn says I agree with, and I rather like his different style of leadership. I like hearing argument not soundbites. If the Labour Party is going through a rough time, and I'm sure it is rough to be in there, it might actually all be to the good. He might be changing the party in a way that would make it easier for people like me to vote for.\\" 2016 saw Beard present Pompeii: New Secrets Revealed with Mary Beard on BBC One in March. While May 2016, brought about a four-part series shown on BBC Two, titled Mary Beard's Ultimate Rome: Empire Without Limit. In 2017, Beard became the target of considerable online abuse after she made the case that Roman Britain was more ethnically diverse than is often assumed. The source of the controversy was a BBC educational video depicting a senior Roman soldier as a black man, which Beard defended as entirely possible after the video received backlash. There followed, according to Beard, ‚Äúa torrent of aggressive insults, on everything from my historical competence and elitist ivory tower viewpoint to my age, shape and gender [batty old broad, obese, etc etc].‚Äù Beard's standalone documentary Julius Caesar Revealed was shown on BBC One in February 2018. In March, she wrote and presented \\"How Do We Look?\\" and \\"The Eye of Faith\\", two of the nine episodes in Civilisations, a reboot of the 1969 series by Kenneth Clark. On 5 January 2019 Beard gave the sesquicentennial Public Lecture for the Society for Classical Studies, marking the 150-year anniversary of the organisation. The topic of her presentation was \\"What do we mean by Classics now?\\". She delivered the Gifford Lectures in May 2019 at Edinburgh University, under the title 'The Ancient World and Us: From Fear and Loathing to Enlightenment and Ethics'. =Approach to scholarship= University of Chicago classicist Clifford Ando described Beard's scholarship as having two key aspects in its approach to sources. One is that she insists that ancient sources be understood as documentation of the attitudes, context and beliefs of their authors, not as reliable sources for the events they address. The other is that she argues that modern histories of Rome must be contextualised within the attitudes, world views and purposes of their authors.

On 20 May 2019 Beard received an honorary degree from Yale University.  Oxfam controversy  In response to a report in The Times of Oxfam employees engaging in sexual exploitation in disaster zones, Beard tweeted \\"Of course one can‚Äôt condone the (alleged) behaviour of Oxfam staff in Haiti and elsewhere. But I do wonder how hard it must be to sustain 'civilised' values in a disaster zone. And overall I still respect those who go in and help out, where most of us would not tread.\\" This led to widespread criticism, in which Mary Beard was accused of racism. In response, Beard posted a picture of herself crying, explaining that she had been subjected to a \\"torrent of abuse\\" and that \\"I find it hard to imagine that anyone out there could possibly think that I am wanting to turn a blind eye to the abuse of women and children\\". Personal life Beard filming in Rome, 2012 Beard married Robin Cormack, a classicist and art historian, in 1985. Their daughter Zoe is an historian of South Sudan and their son Raphael is a scholar of Egyptian literature. In 2000, Beard revealed in an essay for the London Review of Books reviewing a book on rape that she too had been raped, in 1978. Her blog, A Don's Life, gets about 40,000 hits a day, according to The Independent (2013). In August 2014, Beard was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to The Guardian expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in September's referendum on that issue. In July 2015, Beard endorsed Jeremy Corbyn's campaign in the Labour Party leadership election. She said: \\"If I were a member of the Labour Party, I would vote for Corbyn. He actually seems to have some ideological commitment, which could get the Labour Party to think about what it actually stands for.\\" For the 12 December 2019 general election, she was a proposer for the successful Cambridge Labour candidate Daniel Zeichner. In 2019, Beard appeared in an episode of The Grand Tour having dinner with host James May in an effort to get his car photographed by Paparazzi.

The tower which dates from the 14th century is unusual for Norfolk in that it is octagonal (Norfolk churches tend to have square towers, or occasionally round towers). The church was extensively restored in the Victorian period, work being completed in 1871. Inside the church is a 500-year-old font with shields showing the lion and the fleur-de-lys of England and France, the keys of Peter and the swords of Paul, the arms of the see of Norwich (the church is within the Anglican Diocese of Norwich), and the emblem of the Trinity.

Population: . History Little is known of the early history of Korsakov. The site was once home to an Ainu fishing village called Kushunkotan (in Russian sources, Tamari-Aniva), which was frequented by traders of the Matsumae clan from as early as 1790.The Conquest of Ainu Lands, Brett L. Walker, , Coast of Kushunkotan , 1873 map. On September 22, 1853, a Russian expedition, commanded by Gennady Nevelskoy, raised the Russian flag at the settlement and renamed it \\"Fort Muravyovsky\\", after Governor-General of Eastern Siberia Nikolay Muravyov.The Occupation of Southern Saghalin by the Russians in 1853‚Äì54, Akizuki Toshiyuki, Hokkaid≈ç University.‰πÖÊò•Âè§‰∏π„Å´Êñº„Åë„ÇãÈú≤‰∫∫„ÅÆÂ†°Â°û (The garrison of Russians at Kushunkotan), Jirosuke Yoda, 1854. Nevelskoy left detailed recollections of the landing. He encountered a predominantly Ainu population (at least 600 people;Gennady Nevelskoy, Podvigi Russkikh Morskikh Ofitserov Na Kraynem Vostoke (1878), p. 252, footnote. another source mentions only 300 Ainu inhabitants) as well as Japanese nationals who, judging by Nevelskoy's account, exercised authority over the native inhabitants. At the time of Nevelskoy's arrival, the village featured several standing structures‚ÄîNevelskoy calls them \\"sheds\\"‚Äîand even a Japanese religious temple. The villagers supposedly welcomed the Russians after they learned about their mission (protecting them from foreign incursion). Of course, the veracity of this account is in doubt, both because Nevelskoy had ulterior motives for claiming that he was \\"welcomed\\" by the inhabitants, and also because it is not clear to what extent the Russians were able to make themselves understood.Gennady Nevelskoy, Podvigi Russkikh Morskikh Ofitserov Na Kraynem Vostoke (1878), pp. 249‚Äì255). Also available in electronic format: http://orel3.rsl.ru/meeting_on_fr/12/ The Russians abandoned the settlement on May 30, 1854, allegedly because their presence there, at the time of the Crimean War, raised the specter of Anglo-French attack, but returned in August 1869, now renaming the town \\"Fort Korsakovsky,\\" in honor of then-Governor General of Eastern Siberia Mikhail Korsakov. Lingering territorial conflict between Japan and Russia has polarized scholarly opinion of Korsakov's early history, as each side tries to claim priority of early settlement to back up their respective territorial claims in the broader region. In 1875, the whole Sakhalin including the village was ceded to Russia, under the Treaty of Saint Petersburg. While under Russian administration Fort Korsakovsky was an important administrative center in Sakhalin's penal servitude system and a final destination for hundreds of prisoners from European Russia, sentenced to forced labor for particularly serious crimes. Such prisoners and their families comprised early settlers of Fort Korsakovsky until its hand-over to the Japanese. Prominent Russian writers, including A.P. Chekhov and V.M. Doroshevich, visited Korsakovsky and left keen observations of its unsavory trade. During the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905, a naval engagement, the Battle of Korsakov, took place off the town in August 1904. In 1905, Japan conquered Sakhalin in the late stages of the war, and southern Sakhalina, including Korsakovsky, was handed over to Japan in 1905 after Russia's defeat in the war. The Russians burned the wooden town before the hand-over. Upon the ashes of Fort Korsakovsky the Japanese built a stone-clad modern city with paved streets and electricity, renaming it ≈åtomari (Â§ßÊ≥ä). The town was temporarily the capital of Karafuto Prefecture between 1905 and 1907. While in Japanese hands the town grew substantially. A penal colony under Russia's administration, ≈åtomari maintained the practice of forced labor: the Japanese brought thousands of ethnic Koreans to ≈åtomari as slave workers. Korsakov's present-day Korean population is descended mainly from those labor conscripts. In the closing stages of World War II, the Soviet Union conquered Karafuto Prefecture, and Old ≈åtomari was burned down substantially upon the entry of Soviet troops. After the war, Japan ceded Karafuto, including, ≈åtomari, to the Soviet Union. The Japanese population was mostly repatriated by 1947, though a few remained, along with a sizable Korean population. The old bank, a Japanese bank building (originally, the ≈åtomari Branch of Hokkaido Takushoku Bank) remains standing, though efforts to convert it into a museum came to nothing for lack of funds. Other Japanese sites and memorials were all destroyed, including a Shinto shrine and a monument to Prince Hirohito, who had visited ≈åtomari on an inspection tour. An interesting sample of Japanese monuments can now be seen near Prigorodnoye, which was known as Merei before 1945, a fallen stella to Japanese soldiers. During the Cold War Korsakov was also the site of two Naval airfields. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, Korsakov serves as the administrative center of Korsakovsky District and is subordinated to it.Law #25-ZO As a municipal division, the town of Korsakov and seventeen rural localities of Korsakovsky District are incorporated as Korsakovsky Urban Okrug.Law #524 Economy According to a November 1, 1945 Soviet reports, the town had: *two refrigerators for fish processing *a paper factory *a factory to extract salt from sea water (production capacity 20 thousand tons per year) *a sulphur- alcohol plant *7 sake production facilities *2 timber plants Up until the 1990s, Korsakov was a major base for the Russian Far Eastern fishing fleet. It was the home of the Base for Ocean Shipping‚ÄîBaza Okeanicheskogo Rybolovstva‚Äîwhich, however, went bankrupt during the post-Soviet recession, perhaps for no better reason than downright looting of state property. The thousands of fishermen employed in the \\"Bor\\" continued their work for private fishing companies, which usually operated small fishing boats not far off the coast, often without licenses. The catch (primarily crab) was sold in Japan for hard currency, mainly in Wakkanai. Fishermen purchased Japanese electronics and used cars. This semi-illicit, semi-barter economy had a certain positive economic effect on Korsakov, though it inevitably contributed to organized crime. Among other large economic units in Korsakov was a factory, which produced carton boxes‚ÄîFabrika Gofrirovannoy Tary. The factory operated on run-down equipment, probably left over from the Japanese times, and was visible to anyone in Korsakov, as it featured a tall chimney. Gennady Zlivko, formerly a mayor of the town, was once a director of this factory. It has long since gone bankrupt, and its tall chimney, no longer emitting black smoke, is the only thing that reminds one of the earlier years of Korsakov's economy. Korsakov is also the closest town to the huge LNG plant, constructed within the framework of the Sakhalin-2 project. Demographics Curiously, at the early stage of settlement (late 1890s), men in Korsakovsky outnumbered women almost by a factor of ten. In 1897, for example, 1510 males and 192 females lived in the town. This disbalance is explained by the fact that the majority of Korsakov's inhabitants were prisoners and prison-keepers‚Äîin both categories males predominated. The district of Korsakovsky (in 1897 covering 66762 verst) was home to 4659 males and 2194 females‚Äîa much better proportion (fort excluding).http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/rus_gub_97.php?reg=77 The town's population stood at its highest (45 thousand) in the late 1980s, whereupon it experienced significant decline as inhabitants fled economic downturn by moving to neighboring Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk or to continental Russia. Evidently, Korsakov's population remains in decline, although no longer as sharp as in the 1990s.http://www.mojgorod.ru/sahalin_obl/korsakov/index.html The demographic make-up is primarily ethnic Russian with a large ethnic Korean minority. Sport Korsakov is the 2016 bandy champions of Sakhalin.https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=sv&sl;=ru&u;=https://www.sakhalin.info/news/111515/&prev;=search Sights Amenities include a fairly run-down and expensive hotel (\\"Alfa\\") next to the former park. The beach is easily accessible by car (Okhotsk, about 1 hour and Prigorodnoye, about 30 minutes). Formerly well kept beach at Vtoraya Pad has now deteriorated into a messy junkyard. Winter sights include skating at the city stadium and excellent cross-country skiing past the former sea weed plant (Na Agarike). No facilities exist for downhill skiing. The town features a museum with an exhibit describing the local frontier history, and the Japanese possession of the city (1905‚Äì1945). Local market on the Sovetskaya Street offers great strawberries in the summer, and nicely prepared Korean delicacies (kimchi and the local hit, the paporotnik, all year around).

He was appointed as the first Chief Engineer to the Northern Lighthouse Board in 1786. Early life Smith was born in Broughty Ferry near Dundee on 6 December 1752. His father, a skipper, drowned in Dundee harbour while Thomas was still young. As a result, his mother encouraged him towards a career onshore, leading him initially into ironmongery. While his widowed mother remained in Broughty Ferry, Smith went on to establish himself in Edinburgh.  Professional career  In Edinburgh Smith founded and appears to have been the sole proprietor of a successful business in lamps and oils called the Greenside Company's Works. Smith won a contract to provide improved street lighting for Edinburgh's burgeoning New Town. The oil lamps he provided featured parabolic reflectors made from burnished copper, which concentrated the light and enhanced its brightness. Manufacturing such reflectors within tight tolerances was not straightforward, but the innovations devised by Smith gave his lamps quadruple the power of standard oil-lit lamps without any kind of reflector. The success of Smith's work in street lighting provided him with the connections and qualifications which resulted in his appointment as Chief Engineer to the newly formed Northern Lighthouse Trust (now Northern Lighthouse Board) in 1786. He was commissioned to build the first four modern lighthouses and promptly dispatched south to pick-up technical expertise from an English lighthouse builder (possibly John Smeaton, who built the pioneering third Eddystone Lighthouse in the 1750s, or perhaps Ezekiel Walker or William Hutchinson). Upon his return Smith set about the construction of the four new lighthouses at Kinnaird Head, Mull of Kintyre, Eilean Glas, and North Ronaldsay. As well as the design and construction, Smith had to overcome significant financial, logistical and supply-chain challenges resulting from the remote locations of the projects. Nonetheless, all four lighthouses were successfully constructed. Smith quickly adopted the newly invented Argand lamp, which with its circular wick and glass chimney gave a much brighter light than traditional wick lamps. Most significantly, he combined this with his parabolic reflectors resulting in a combination which came to be known as the catoptric system and set the standard for lighthouse illumination at that time. The first of his lighthouses - Kinnaird Head (1787) - had 17 whale-oil lamps backed by parabolic reflectors and was said to be the most powerful light of its day with a reported range of 12 to 14 miles (10 to 12 mmi; 19 to 23 km). Smith continued to experiment and improve on his designs over the coming years and it was one of his last designs, Start Point, Sanday (1806), which incorporated a revolving light which was to become universal. Smith stepped-down from his role with the Northern Lighthouse Board in 1808 and was succeeded by his stepson Robert Stevenson. However, he remained active in his private business. Family life In 1792 - five years after his appointment to the Northern Lighthouse Board - Smith married his third wife, Jean Lille Stevenson (1751‚Äì1820). Prior to this, Smith had been twice widowed. He had five children by his first wife, though only a daughter (Jane) and son (James) survived infancy. He had one further daughter (Mary-Anne), by his second wife. Jean Lille Stevenson was herself a widow, with a young son called Robert Stevenson. Her first husband was Alan Stevenson, a partner in a West Indies sugar trading house in Glasgow who died of epidemic fever on the island of St. Christopher in the West Indies in 1774 leaving Jean Lille in precarious financial circumstances. The new family initially lived at 1 Blair Street off the Royal Mile in Edinburgh's Old Town,Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1790 before moving to the then newly built 2 Baxter's Place at the head of Leith Walk in 1798/9.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1815 The relationship between Thomas Smith and his step-son Robert Stevenson proved to be close and admiring. Though Stevenson's mother had intended him for a career in the ministry, he instead became a keen assistant to his step-father's works and was formally apprenticed to Smith in 1791. This relationship was further cemented by an unusual circumstance: in 1799 Stevenson married his then 20-year-old step-sister Jane. The following year, Stevenson became a full partner in Smith's firm and eventually succeeded him as Chief Engineer to the Northern Lighthouse Board in 1808, initiating a dynasty of Stevenson's as lighthouse builders. Little is known about Thomas Smith's own son James except that he left home to found his own ironmongery business, but whether this was due to some rift with his father is unknown. His daughter Janet was mother to the physicist William Swan. Smith died at home in 2 Baxter's Place in on 21 June 1815, aged 62. He is buried in the north-east section of Old Calton Burial Ground. Upon his death, it was Robert Stevenson who inherited the house.

He was the brother of Hiram Stevens Maxim, inventor of the Maxim gun and uncle of Hiram Percy Maxim, inventor of the Maxim Silencer. Career Maxim started his career in 1881 as the publisher of Real Pen Work - Self Instructor in Penmanship, a book addressing the arts of calligraphy and penmanship, and the sale of special inks, pens, and other supplies related to penmanship. Later he joined his brother Hiram Stevens Maxim's workshop in the United Kingdom, where they both worked on the improvement of smokeless gunpowder. After some disputes, Hudson Maxim returned to the United States and developed a number of stable high explosives, the rights of which were sold to the DuPont company. During World War I, Maxim wrote a book, Defenseless America, in which he pointed out the inferiority of the American defence system and the vulnerability of the country against attacks of foreign aggressors. His good friend, Elbert Hubbard, died on the RMS Lusitania when it was torpedoed by a German submarine. This event fueled his belief that the USA should improve its defenses and join the war against Germany on the side of the Entente. Maxim also wrote the book The Science of Poetry and the Philosophy of Language about the nature and writing of poetry. In this work, he contended that words, like chemical particles, had natural laws that governed the manner in which they could be combined into verse, and that poetry perceived as excellent was in fact one that conformed to those laws. He also argued that certain famous poets (William Shakespeare, William Wordsworth) had discovered those laws and put them to use in their poetry. During his experimental career, he lost his left hand in a mercury fulminate explosion in 1894. Personal During the last 25 years of his life, Maxim spent most of his time at his home on the shores of Lake Hopatcong, New Jersey. He was a great promoter and supporter of the development of Lake Hopatcong and the Borough of Hopatcong and is honored by memorials in Hopatcong State Park and the Borough of Hopatcong's Maxim Glen Park. He spoke and wrote prolifically on many topics - from his opposition to maintaining the Morris Canal, to his disdain of Prohibition, to his love of poetry and boxing. Maxim appeared as King Neptune during the first two years of the Miss America Pageant in 1921 and 1922, arriving on a great float and presenting the trophy to the winner. He was an important member of the College of Fellows of the Academy of Nations.

The college's name is from the former grammar school located in the northern part of Basingstoke and the college is located in the former school buildings of the Shrubbery All Girls secondary modern, which dates back to the early 1950s. As of the 1st of October, the college is now managed and run as an academy by the single academy trust North Hampshire Education Trust. College The college was formed in 1972. The majority of the college's classrooms are housed in a single, two-storey, wide spread main building with a few smaller buildings and four temporary buildings providing most of the rest of the teaching space. However, three departments are predominantly housed away from the main college building. Physical Education (and related subjects) are able to make use of the QM Sports Centre while ICT & Art (and related subjects) are now housed in a recently completed (2005) ¬£6m 3-storey teaching block. Science has recently been moved to a new multimillion-pound teaching block, which was completed during the later part of 2009, with the first lessons taking place at the beginning of January 2010. The building was officially opened by quantum physicist Jim Al-Khalili OCE on Friday 23 April 2010. Drama and Music are located in the Central Studio, which plays host to a number of shows and performances all year round. =QM Sports Centre= QM Sports Centre is located on the main college campus and, although open to the general public, is widely used by the college both as a sports centre and for educational reasons. The centre's main facilities are a hall and a swimming pool. The centre itself also incorporates a fitness centre and viewing gallery and also makes use of the college's various football, rugby and artificial turfed pitches. =Central Studio= Central Studio is a professional theatre located on the college campus. While the college's various departments use the facilities of Central Studio, including the bar, theatre, dance studio and recording facilities the building itself is often used to host various professional productions and concerts. In 2009, Central Studio put on a production of 'The Laramie Project', a play about an American youth who was killed for his sexuality. Westboro Church planned to picket outside the college in protest, but were banned from the UK as a precaution against inciting hatred. In 1978 Peter Cushing was present at the official opening of Central studio where students presented a number of theatrical and musical performances. Curriculum Queen Mary's College offers AS and A-level courses in 40 different subjects, as well as several vocational courses and BTEC national diplomas. The college has approximately 2400 students (the majority aged between 16 and 19) enrolled on full-time courses. It also offers a range of Adult Education opportunities, and has over 1000 students enrolled on part-time courses. The majority of students come from the Basingstoke and Deane & Hart areas.

Many of his visionary tales appeared in magazines such as Pearson's Magazine and Pearson's Weekly before being published as novels. Griffith was extremely popular in the United Kingdom, though he failed to find similar acclaim in the United States, in part due to his utopian socialist views. A journalist, rather than a scientist, by background, what his stories lack in scientific rigour and literary grace they make up for in sheer exuberance of execution. :\\"To-night that spark was to be shaken from the torch of Revolution, and to-morrow the first of the mines would explode...the armies of Europe would fight their way through the greatest war that the world had ever seen.\\" ‚Äì from Griffith's most famous novel The Angel of the Revolution. Life He was the son of a vicar who became a schoolmaster in his mid-20s. After writing freelance articles in his spare time, he joined a newspaper for a short spell, then authored a series of secular pamphlets including Ananias, The Atheist's God: For the Attention of Charles Bradlaugh. After the success of Admiral Philip H. Colomb's The Great War of 1892 (itself a version of the more famous The Battle of Dorking), Griffith, then on the staff of Pearson's Magazine as a clerk addressing envelopes and mailing labels, submitted a synopsis for a story entitled The Angel of the Revolution. It remains his best and most famous work. It was among the first of the so-called marvel tales, epitomised by Jules Verne. Marvel tales featured such things as heavier-than-air flying machines, compressed air guns, submarines, profoundly convenient political developments, wooden heroes with no readily apparent sexual tastes, and spectacular aerial, land, or undersea combat. Later novels, such as The Gold Finder developed the heroes' romantic interests. His short stories were very similar to the future war tales of George Chesney and his imitators along with the political utopianism of William Morris' News from Nowhere. He wrote a sequel, serialised as The Syren of the Skies in Pearson's Magazine. It was later published as a novel titled with the name of its main character, Olga Romanoff. Although overshadowed by H. G. Wells in the United States, Griffith's epic fantasies of romantic utopians in a future world of war, dominated by airship battle fleets, and grandiose engineering provided a template for steampunk novels 100 years before the term was even coined. Michael Moorcock claims that the works of George Griffith had a dramatic impact on his own writing. The concept of revolutionaries imposing \\"a pax aeronautica over the earth\\", at the center of The Angel of the Revolution, was taken up by Wells many years later, in The Shape of Things to Come. Wells himself once wrote that Griffith's Outlaws of the Air was an \\"aeronautical classic\\". Though a less accomplished writer than Upton Sinclair, George Bernard Shaw, and H.G. Wells, his novels were extremely popular in their day, seeing many printings . Griffith's stories foreshadowed World War I and foretold a utopian communist revolution in the United States. It also predicted that Great Britain would ally itself with Germany against a Franco-Russian-Italian alliance, almost the exact opposite of what actually happened when World War I started. Griffith also employed the concepts of the air to surface missile and VTOL aircraft. He wrote several tales of adventure set on contemporary earth, while The Outlaws of the Air depicted a future of aerial warfare and the creation of a Pacific island utopia. Sam Moskowitz described him as \\"undeniably the most popular science fiction writer in England between 1893 and 1895.\\" Some of his books (especially The Gold Finder) also reflected a belief in the undesirability of racial mixing, due to a supposed deficiency in the black race. These beliefs were similar to those of some of the revolutionary type of socialists of the time, such as Jack London. His science fiction depicted grand and unlikely voyages through our solar system in the spirit of Wells or Jules Verne, though his explorers donned space suits remarkably prescient in their design. Honeymoon in Space saw his newly married adventurers, exemplars of the \\"Race that Rules\\", exploring planets in different stages of geological and Darwinian evolution on an educational odyssey drawing heavily on earlier cosmic voyages by Camille Flammarion, W. S. Lach-Szyrma, and Edgar Fawcett. Its illustrations by Stanley L. Wood have proved more significant, providing the first depictions of slender, super-intelligent aliens with large, bald heads ‚Äì the archetype of the famous Greys of modern science fiction. His short story \\"The Great Crellin Comet\\", published in 1897, was the first story to not only include a 10-second countdown for a space launch (though a countdown of sorts is included in Jules Verne's 1887 novel, The Purchase of the North Pole), but also the first story to suggest that a cometary collision with the earth could be stopped by human intervention. As an explorer of the real world, he shattered the existing record for voyaging around the world at the behest of Sir Arthur Pearson, completing his journey in just 65 days. He also helped discover the source of the Amazon River. This was documented in Pearson's Magazine before being published as a book, Around the World in 65 Days, in 2009. He died of cirrhosis of the liver, at the age of 48, in 1906. Legacy His son was the engineer Alan Arnold Griffith, who was the originator of the Griffith crack theory concerning brittle materials such as glass.

In 2006 Apogee Books released The World Peril of 1910 as part of its series of classic science fiction. In 2008 Apogee released Around the World in 65 Days, an anthology of travel writing. The book collects Griffith's world travels, including one trip around the world done in a record-breaking 65 days. In addition, many of Griffith's other adventures are included. His trip to South America is recounted in \\"A Railway Beyond the Clouds\\", \\"A Ride to the City of the Sun\\", \\"A Paradise of Tomorrow\\", \\"The Most Majestic Mountain\\", and \\"Los Medanos\\". His travels of North America in \\"The Snake-Dancers of Arizona\\" are somehow even more exotic. Griffith claims to have made the first intentional flight across the English Channel in \\"To France by Air\\". In \\"When will the 20th Century Begin?\\", Griffith discusses the intricacies of time zones, something with which he had quite a lot of practice. The Apogee edition includes an introduction by Griffith's grandson, John Griffith, relating some of the family history, particularly of Alan Arnold Griffith, and a biography of George Griffith by editor Robert Godwin. In 2009, Leonaur Press released The Angel of the Revolution and Olga Romanoff as a two-volume set entitled Empire of the Air in both hardback and paperback. In 2011 Apogee Books released A Honeymoon in Space.

The Armory has a capacity of 4,300 for concerts and conventions and 3,600 for sports events. History The Armory was built in 1890 for the Tenth Battalion of the New York National Guard, designed by state architect Isaac Perry. Since the earliest years of professional and collegiate basketball, several college and minor league basketball teams have played in the Armory, as there was no other suitable facility for basketball in the Albany area for many years. The Armory also hosts boxing matches. For many years in the 1960s and 1970s the armory hosted the WWF (currently known as the WWE) wrestling association owned by the McMahon family. The Friday night cards were always a sellout. Between 1982 and 1990, the Armory was home to the Albany Patroons of the Continental Basketball Association. After the Patroons moved to the then-new Knickerbocker Arena, the Armory fell into disuse and was the target of several reuse proposals including becoming the new home of the Albany Library System (whose main branch is next door to the Armory). The Armory was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on March 2, 1995. In 2004, Albany Basketball & Sports Corporation bought the Armory and the renovated facility opened in September 2005, later that year becoming the home for a reincarnated Patroons. In 2006, the CBA Patroons were joined by the former Pennsylvania ValleyDawgs of the USBL though their first home game as the USBL Patroons did not take place until 2007. It also became home to the New York Buzz of World TeamTennis prior to their 2008 season. On December 15, 2007 the Armory had to cancel a concert of the rock band Brand New because the roof began to cave in. Facilities and management Armory logo The Armory has of floor space, meeting facilities, and two video screens.

According to folklore, it is deposited on the Earth during meteor showers. Star jelly is described as a translucent or grayish-white gelatin that tends to evaporate shortly after having \\"fallen.\\" Explanations have ranged from the materials being the remains of frogs, toads, or worms, to the byproducts of cyanobacteria, to the paranormal. Reports of the substance date back to the 14th century and have continued to the present day. History There have been reports of 'star- jelly' for centuries.Fort, C. \\"The Book of the Damned\\" pp41-50, 1919 John of Gaddesden (1280‚Äì1361),Gordon, p. 467 for example, mentions stella terrae (Latin for 'star of the earth' or 'earth-star') in his medical writings, describing it as \\"a certain mucilaginous substance lying upon the earth\\" and suggesting that it might be used to treat abscesses.\\"stella terre, que est quedam mucillago jacens super terram, prohibet apostemata calida in principio\\", from John of Gaddesden, \\"Rosa Medicinae\\" or \\"Rosa Anglica\\", Venice edition of 1502, folio 28. There is another reference to stella terrae, as a component in a medical recipe, on folio 49 of the same work. A fourteenth- century Latin medical glossary has an entry for uligo, described as \\"a certain fatty substance emitted from the earth, that is commonly called 'a star which has fallen'\\".\\"Uligo, i. grassities quedam que scatet a terra que vulgariter dicitur stella que cecidit\\", from Mowat, J. L. G. \\"Sinonoma Bartholomei\\", Oxford, 1882, p. 43 Similarly, an English-Latin dictionary from around 1440 has an entry for \\"sterre slyme\\" with the Latin equivalent given as assub (a rendering of Arabic ash-shuhub, also used in medieval Latin as a term for a \\"falling\\" or \\"shooting\\" star). The Oxford English Dictionary lists a large number of other names for the substance, with references dating back to the circa-1440 English-Latin dictionary entry mentioned above: star-fallen, star- falling, star-jelly, star-shot, star-slime, star-slough, star-slubber, and star-slutch.See the Oxford English Dictionary, under the words nostoc, star, and star-shot. The slime mold Enteridium lycoperdon is called \\"caca de luna\\" (moon's excrement) by the locals in the state of Veracruz in Mexico. A long article in the paranormal magazine Fate declared star jelly to be of extraterrestrial origin, calling it \\"cellular organic matter\\" which exists as \\"prestellar molecular clouds\\" which float through space. In The Book of British Amphibians and Reptiles (page 138), author M. Smith states that star jelly is most likely formed from the glands in the oviducts of frogs and toads. Birds and mammals will eat the animals but not the oviducts which, when they come into contact with moisture, swell and distort leaving a vast pile of jellylike substance sometimes also referred to as otter jelly. In 1910, T. Mckenny Hughes ruminated in Nature as to why meteors were associated with star jelly by poets and ancient writers, and observed that the jelly seemed to \\"grow out from among the roots of grass\\". Scientific analysis and theories regurgitated by predators (The black object in lower left corner is a cluster of eggs.). Fructification of a slime mold. false puffball slime mold in its aethalioid jelly phase. * Observations made of star jelly in Scotland support the theory that one origin of star jelly is spawn jelly from frogs or toads, which has been vomited up by amphibian-eating creatures. However, no frog spawn has ever approached the size of some reported cases of star jelly. The German terms Sternenrotz (star snot) and Meteorgallerte (meteorite jelly) are known to refer to more or less digested frog spawn vomited by predators (Schl√ºpmann 2007). * Scientists commissioned by the National Geographic Society have carried out tests on samples found in the United States, but have failed to find any DNA in the material. * Thomas Pennant in the 18th century believed the material to be \\"something vomited up by birds or animals\\". * Nostoc, a type of fresh water blue-green algae (cyanobacteria) forms spherical colonies made of filaments of cells in a gelatinous sheath. When on the ground, it is ordinarily not seen; but after rainfall it swells up into a conspicuous jellylike mass which is sometimes called star-jelly. * Slime molds are possible causes, appearing suddenly, exhibiting a very gelatinous appearance at first and later changing to a dust-like form which is dispersed by rain and wind. The colours range from a striking pure white as in Enteridium lycoperdon, to pink as in Lycogala epidendrum, to purple, bright yellow, orange, and brown. Examples * On 11 November 1846, a luminous object estimated at 4 feet in diameter fell at Lowville, New York, leaving behind a heap of foul-smelling luminous jelly that disappeared quickly, according to Scientific AmericanScientific American 2:79, 28 November 1846, see * In 1950, four Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, policemen reported the discovery of \\"a domed disk of quivering jelly, 6 feet in diameter, one foot thick at the center and an inch or two near the edge\\". When they tried to pick it up, it dissolved into an \\"odorless, sticky scum\\".The site was located (near 26th Street and Vare Avenue) within a half-mile (800 m) of the Philadelphia Gas Works, leading to the possibility that it was some type of industrial discharge. This incident inspired the 1958 movie The Blob. * On 11 August 1979, Sybil Christian of Frisco, Texas reported the discovery of several purple blobs of goo on her front yard following a Perseid meteor shower. A follow up investigation by reporters and an assistant director of the Fort Worth Museum of Science and History discovered a battery reprocessing plant outside of town where caustic soda was used to clean impurities from the lead in the batteries, resulting in a purplish compound as a byproduct. The report was greeted with some skepticism, however, as the compounds at the reprocessing plant were solid, whereas the blobs on Christian's lawn were gelatinous. Others, however, have pointed out that Christian had tried to clear them off her lawn with a garden hose. * In December 1983, grayish-white, oily gelatin fell on North Reading, Massachusetts. Thomas Grinley reported finding it on his lawn, on the streets and sidewalks, and dripping from gas station pumps. * On several dates in 1994, \\"gelatinous rain\\" fell on Oakville, Washington. * On the evening of 3 November 1996, a meteor was reported flashing across the sky of Kempton, Tasmania, just outside Hobart. The next morning, white translucent slime was reportedly discovered on the lawns and sidewalks of the town. * In 1997, a similar substance fell in the Everett, Washington, area. * Star jelly was found on various Scottish hills in the autumn of 2009. * Blue balls of jelly rained down on a man's garden in Dorset in January 2012. Upon further analysis these proved to be sodium polyacrylate granules, a kind of superabsorbent polymer with a variety of common (including agricultural) uses. They were most likely already present on the ground in their dehydrated state, and had gone un-noticed until they soaked up water from the hail shower and consequently grew in size. * Several deposits were discovered at the Ham Wall nature reserve in England in February 2013. It has been suggested that these are unfertilised frog spawn but ‚Äì contrary to some reports ‚Äì the substance has yet to be identified. * In the BBC programme Nature's Weirdest Events, Series 4, episode 3, (14 January 2015) Chris Packham showed a specimen of \\"star jelly\\" and had it sent to the Natural History Museum, London, for a DNA analysis by Dr. David Bass who confirmed it was from a frog. He also found some traces of magpie on the jelly which may point to the demise of the frog. In fiction * Sir John Suckling, in 1641, wrote a poem which contained the following lines: > As he whose quicker eye doth trace A false star shot to a mark'd place Do's > run apace, And, thinking it to catch, A jelly up do snatch * Henry More, in 1656 wrote: > That the Starres eat...that those falling Starres, as some call them, which > are found on the earth in the form of a trembling gelly, are their > excrement. * John Dryden, in 1679, wrote: > When I had taken up what I supposed a fallen star I found I had been cozened > with a jelly. * William Somervile, in 1740, wrote in The Talisman: > Swift as the shooting star, that gilds the night With rapid transient Blaze, > she runs, she flies; Sudden she stops nor longer can endure The painful > course, but drooping sinks away, And like that falling Meteor, there she > lyes A jelly cold on earth. Sir Walter Scott, in his novel The Talisman, wrote: > \\"Seek a fallen star,\\" said the hermit, \\"and thou shalt only light on some > foul jelly, which, in shooting through the horizon, has assumed for a moment > an appearance of splendour.\\" An unidentifiable substance that falls to earth during a meteor-type event forms the background to \\"The Colour Out of Space\\", a 1927 short story by the American horror and science fiction author H. P. Lovecraft. Some observers have made a connection between star jelly and the Paramount movie The Blob, in which a gelatinous monster slime falls from space. The Blob, which was released in 1958, was supposedly based on the Philadelphia reports from 1950 and specifically a report in the Philadelphia Inquirer called \\"Flying 'Saucer' Just Dissolves\\" where four police officers encountered a UFO debris that was described as evaporating with a purple glow leaving nothing. Paramount Pictures was also sued for this movie by the author Joseph Payne Brennan, who had written a short story published in Weird Tales Magazine in 1953 called \\"Slime\\" about a similar creature. In the 1978 film Invasion of the Body Snatchers, the alien spores that fall to Earth in a rain shower form blobs of jelly that grow into flowers which produce the seed pods. In the 2011 novel The Isle of Blood by Rick Yancey, star jelly (referred to as \\"Pwdre Ser\\" in the story) is the saliva of a monster called \\"Magnificum\\" that falls to earth along with blood and shredded human remains, sometimes weaved into a nest or bowl of sorts, known as a \\"nidus\\". Anyone who comes in contact with Pwdre Ser becomes \\"infected\\", and will slowly decline in health until they are literally a living corpse. Mary-Ann Constantine's 2016 novel, Star-Shot, is named after another word for the phenomenon, and features a character taking a sample to be analysed.

The stable was formed in 1987 and lasted until 1989. The stable was briefly resurrected in 1999‚Äì2000. History The Varsity Club formed in the NWA's Jim Crockett Promotions by Kevin Sullivan after he recruited Rick Steiner who was of University of Michigan's and Syracuse University's Mike Rotunda in early 1988. The group would wear the letterman jackets of their respective alma maters and brag about their superiority to other wrestlers on the roster because of their amateur wrestling background. In Rotunda and Steiner's case their claims were legitimate, as they both wrestled in college, while Sullivan's claims were more a matter of Kayfabe. Rotunda was the Florida Champion, but when he defeated Nikita Koloff (with Kevin Sullivan's help) to win the NWA World Television Championship, he gave the Florida title to Steiner. The team seemed cohesive initially under Sullivan's leadership, but began to experience dissension as Rotunda and Steiner bickered over who was the ‚ÄúCaptain‚Äù of the team. In February 1988, the Club started a feud with Jimmy Garvin because Sullivan wanted Garvin's valet Precious. Sullivan would stalk Precious and taunt her with papers in his robe, but it was never revealed why he was stalking her or what the papers were about. Garvin got help from his \\"brother\\" ‚ÄùRugged‚Äù Ron Garvin and \\"Dr. Death\\" Steve Williams in his fight with the club. At Clash of the Champions I Rotunda defeated Jimmy Garvin in a ‚ÄúCollege Rules‚Äù match. Three months later Garvin got revenge as he and Ron defeated Rotunda and Steiner at Clash of the Champions II. The fact that it was Steiner who lost the match was further cause for friction in the club. Sullivan and Rotunda started to punish the ‚Äúslow witted‚Äù Steiner (in character) and taunted him mercilessly. At The Great American Bash 1988 the Garvins/Varsity Club feud came to a violent clash as the Garvins teamed with the Road Warriors and Steve Williams to beat Sullivan, Rotunda, Al Perez, The Russian Assassin and Ivan Koloff in a Tower of Doom Match. In September 1988 the Club attacked Jimmy Garvin; Sullivan used a cinder block to ‚Äúbreak‚Äù Garvin's leg, effectively ending the feud. Steiner began a slow face turn when he tried to save Sting from a beatdown by The Road Warriors, who turned on him after a match against the club. Steiner finally reached his breaking point near the end of 1988, when he attacked Rotunda, turning face as a sympathetic underdog. At Starrcade 1988 he received a match with Rotunda for the TV title. Despite being locked in a cage at ringside, Sullivan had an ace up his sleeve. The ace was former opponent Steve Williams, a University of Oklahoma alumnus who had just joined the Varsity Club. Though Williams was unable to prevent Steiner from winning the TV title, his arrival signified a major recruiting coup for Sullivan. Earlier in the night, Sullivan and Williams brought gold back to the stable when they defeated the Fantastics for the United States Tag-Team titles. Steiner's run with the TV title ended a few months later as Rotundo regained the belt at the Chi-Town Rumble on February 20, 1989. He did get impressive backup from his brother Scott, a recent arrival who was eager to help. Though Scott's role was initially limited to moral support, he and Rick would later go on to become one of the most accomplished tag team in the promotion's history. The Steiners celebrated when Rick and \\"Hot Stuff\\" Eddie Gilbert won the US Tag-Team titles from Williams and Sullivan on February 28. In early 1989, the group added University of Georgia alumnus Dan Spivey to their ranks in an effort to dominate the promotion. This was an attempt to fill a power vacuum created by the disbanding of The Four Horsemen. The effort got off to a rocky start when Rotunda lost the TV Title to Sting. on March 31, 1989. Throughout the spring of 1989, the club made several attempts to dethrone reigning NWA World Tag Team Champions the Road Warriors, including Sullivan and Williams' match with them at the Chi-Town Rumble. On April 2, 1989 at Clash of the Champions VI the combination of Williams and Rotunda were able to defeat the Warriors, thanks to a fast count by referee Teddy Long., who had been bribed by Sullivan. The duo managed to keep the titles through Sullivan's outside interference and frequent disqualifications, including at their title defense at WrestleWar 1989. However, due to the controversial way the Club won and defended the titles, they were stripped of the gold that night. The club was unable to regain the US Tag titles from Rick Steiner and Eddie Gilbert, although they did force Gilbert to leave the promotion for a short time. Gilbert's departure provided the impetus for Rick to team with his brother Scott, a pairing that would go on to become very successful in the coming years. Shortly after WrestleWar 1989, the club began to disintegrate with the departures of Williams and later Spivey, who started to work with Sid Vicious as one of The Skyscrapers. This left Sullivan and Rotunda as the sole Varsity Club members, meaning the stable was effectively finished. The Steiner Brothers made their team debut at the Great American Bash 1989, beating Sullivan and Rotunda in a Texas Tornado Match. The last official appearance of the Club occurred when former member Williams defeated Rotunda at Clash of the Champions VIII. Rotunda would later turn face in 1990, becoming \\"Captain Mike Rotunda,\\" and he would form a crew with Abdullah the Butcher and Norman the Lunatic to feud with a group formed by former Varsity Club teammate Kevin Sullivan, known as \\"Sullivan's Slaughterhouse,\\" composed of Cactus Jack, Buzz Sawyer, and Bam Bam Bigelow, with barely any mention being made of Rotunda's and Sullivan's past association during the feud. Rotunda and Steiner would later feud briefly in the World Wrestling Federation, with Rotunda now playing a tax man named Irwin R. Schyster, who teamed with Ted DiBiase to form Money Incorporated. Money Inc. would lose the WWF Tag Team Championship to Rick and his brother, Scott Steiner, twice. =Reunion= The Varsity Club had a brief reformation in WCW in 1999 when Sullivan, Rotunda and Steiner teamed together at Starrcade on December 19, 1999. The three men were ‚ÄùHacksaw‚Äù Jim Duggan‚Äôs surprise partners, showing up in their old letterman jackets and accompanied by a cheerleader, Leia Meow; they made her do pushups and bounce on a trampoline at ringside. The Club turned on Duggan at the end of the match, leaving him easy prey for The Revolution. The Club disbanded in late January 2000 after a brief feud with Don and Ron Harris. In September 2000, Williams and Rotunda reformed their team, under the name Varsity Club 2000, in All Japan Pro Wrestling. Williams had been a regular in AJPW since the original stable's break up and Rotunda started touring after leaving WCW. Despite winning the promotion's annual World's Strongest Tag Determination League tournament in December, they were never able to enjoy much success due to Rotunda's injuries and the phasing out of foreign talent left from the All Japan promotional system before the Pro Wrestling Noah split.

Despite public accusations by Whittaker Chambers and others, Duggan's loyalty was attested to by such prominent people as Attorney General Tom C. Clark, Eleanor Roosevelt, and Duggan's close associate journalist Edward R. Murrow, among others. However, in the 1990s, evidence from decrypted Soviet telegrams revealed that he was an active Soviet spy for the KGB in the 1930s and 1940s. Allen Weinstein and Alexander Vassiliev, The Haunted Wood: Soviet Espionage in America - The Stalin Era (2000) pp 3-21. Background Phillips Exeter Academy's Academy Building Laurence Hayden Duggan was born on May 28, 1905, in New York City. His father, Stephen P. Duggan, was a professor of Political Science at the City College of New York before founding the Institute of International Education. His mother Sarah Alice Elsesser was a director of the \\"Negro Welfare League\\" of White Plains, New York. Duggan received early education at the Roger Ascham School in Hartsdale, New York, and White Plains Community Church, where he learned simplicity, courtesy, and democracy. In 1923, he graduate cum laude from the Phillips Exeter Academy. In 1927, he graduated with distinction from Harvard University. (Ware Group members such as Alger Hiss and Lee Pressman were 1929 graduates of Harvard Law School.) In 1930, when he joined State, he took postgraduate courses in history, government, and economics at the George Washington University. Career Dana Carleton Munro (1904) hired Duggan for Latin American affairs at the State Department In 1927, Duggan began his career by working for Harper Brothers publishers. By 1929, his father, then director of the Institute of International Education, created a bureau for Latin America and offered the position to his son. Duggan accepted, learned Spanish and Portuguese, and toured the region to become better acquainted with it. By 1930, he had produced a report that reached Charles Howland, head of studies in international relations at Yale University. Howland forwarded the report to Dana Munro, chief of the Latin American Division, who offered Duggan a position. =Civil service= Mother's Day in UNRRA displaced persons camp in Germany In 1930, Duggan moved to Washington, DC, to join the U.S. Department of State‚Äînine of those years as head of the Latin American Division and four as adviser on political relations. (His Harvard friend Noel Field had joined State in the late 1920s.) Duggan served as Secretary of State Cordell Hull's at major conference in Lima, Peru and Havana, Cuba. Positions he held included Chief of the Division of the American Republics as well as Political Adviser and Director of the Office of the American Republics. In 1944, Duggan returned briefly to the private sector, when he served as consultant on Latin American affairs‚Äìa \\"profitable business.\\" Shortly thereafter, Herbert H. Lehman (New York governor) and Dr. Eduardo Santos (former president of Colombia, asked Duggan to serve the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) for six months. (In 1936, his friend Noel Field had taken a position for the U.S. with the League of Nations and then in 1941 become director of the American Unitarian Universalist Service Committee's relief mission in Marseilles.) =Institute of International Education= Edward R. Murrow, CBS News journalist and IIE trustee In 1946, a committee of the IIE (comprising Virginia Gildersleeve of Barnard College, Edward R. Murrow of CBS News, Waldo Leland of the Carnegie Institute, and Arthur W. Packard of Rockefeller Brothers Fund) offered Duggan the presidency of the Institute of International Education (IIE) upon his father's retirement. The IIE provided for a flow of exchange students between the United States and several other countries. On November 1, 1946, Duggan began as IIE president. One of his first actions was to make the board more inclusive by adding women, union representatives (\\"labor men\\"), and African-Americans including Benjamin Mays of Morehouse College. He expanded students to include trainees, entrepreneurs, labor leaders, professionals, artists, and musicians. U.S. President Truman appointed Duggan to the ten-member administrators of the Fulbright Act. He provided advice during the establishment of UNESCO. In 1947, he served as a member of the U.S. delegation to the second session of the UNESCO general conference, held in Mexico City. During his two years as president, IIE's funding increased its budget nearly 400% from $109,000 to $430,000. Funding from the Carnegie Corporation alone increased $50,000 per year during that time (and Alger Hiss became president of sister organization, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace within days of Duggan's appointment to the IIE). Espionage U.S. Ambassador William Christian Bullitt Jr., one of Duggan's (unwitting) sources Duggan was a close friend of Noel Field of the State Department. The GRU had also tried to recruit him through Frederick Field. In the mid-1930s, Duggan was recruited by Hede Massing as a Soviet spy. Duggan told the FBI that Henry Collins of the Ware group had also tried unsuccessfully to recruit him to the NKVD. Allen Weinstein and Alexander Vassiliev, The Haunted Wood: Soviet Espionage in America - The Stalin Era (2000) pp 3-21. Peter Gutzeit, the Soviet Consul in New York City, was also an officer in the NKVD. In 1934 he identified Laurence Duggan as a potential recruit. Boris Bazarov told Hede Massing that they wanted her to help recruit Duggan and Noel Field. The plan, suggested by Gutzeit, was to use Duggan to draw Field into the network.http://spartacus- educational.com/Laurence_Duggan.htm Gutzeit wrote on 3 October 1934, that Duggan \\"is interesting us because through him one will be able to find a way toward Noel Field... of the State Department's European Department with whom Duggan is friendly.\\" Peter Gutzeit, Soviet Consulate in New York City, memorandum to Moscow (3rd October, 1934) Duggan provided Soviet intelligence with confidential diplomatic cables, including from American Ambassador William Bullitt. He was a source for the Soviets until he resigned from the State Department in 1944.Allen Weinstein and Alexander Vassiliev, The Haunted Wood: Soviet Espionage in America - The Stalin Era (2000) pp 3-21. According to Whittaker Chambers in his 1952 memoir, Egmont Gaines proposed covert group, \\"insisting\\" the group approach Duggan, \\"whom he called 'very sympathetic'.\\" Duggan was then in the State Department, and became chief of its Latin- American Division. According to Boris Bazarov, Duggan told his Soviet handlers, he only remained \\"at his hateful job in the State Department\\" because he was \\"useful for our cause.\\"Julian Borger, \\"The Spy Who Made McCarthy: New Evidence Reveals that the Unwitting Architect of the McCarthy Witch-Hunts was a Soviet Agent,\\" The Guardian, 26 January 1999. Personal and death Interior of Institute of International Education (undated) In 1932, Duggan married Helen Boyd, a Vassar College graduate. They had four children: Stephanie, Laurence Jr., Robert, and Christoper. =December 20, 1948= On December 20, 1948, Duggan fell to his death from his office at the Institute of International Education, located on the 16th floor of a building in midtown Manhattan. His body was discovered around 7:00 PM that evening. A few days later, the New York Police Department made public the result of its investigation, which concluded: \\"Mr. Duggan either accidentally fell or jumped.\\" During his last four days, he spoke with his father about funding for the IIE, his mother about Christmas, with Dr. Santos at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel about US-Latin American relations, and on December 20 itself with Pierre B√©dard, director of the French Institute, about inviting a distinguished French national to lecture in the United States under IIE auspices. =Remembrances= Archibald MacLeish, who composed a poem in Duggan's memory Friends published a memorial book about Duggan, with contributions made directly to the book or gleaned from the press by: Eleanor Roosevelt, Tom C. Clark, Sumner Welles, Marquis Childs (friend), Edward R. Murrow, Roscoe Drummond, and Raymond Moley, Joseph Harsh, Elmer Davis, Martin Agronsky, Henry R. Luce, Clarence Pickett, and Harry Emerson Fosdick. Archibald MacLeish composed a memorial poem, published in the New York Herald Tribune On December 21, 1948, at 7:45 PM (barely 24 hours after Duggan's death), Murrow broadcast on CBS radio: > Tonight, the headlines are shouting: \\"Duggan Named in Spy Case.\\" Who named > him? Isaac Don Levine, who said he was quoting Whittaker Chambers. And who > denies it? Whittaker Chambers. Tonight, Representative Mundt says: \\"The > Duggan affair is a close book so far as the House Committee is concerned.\\" > The Representative from South Dakota also says he is thinking of making > recommendations for changing the procedure at committee hearings, maybe even > giving the accused person the right to be heard before the Committee issues > a report. > The members of the Committee who have done this thing upon such slight and > wholly discredited testimony may now consult their actions and their > consciences. =Deaths of W. Marvin Smith and others = On October 20, 1948, W. Marvin Smith, a U.S. Department of Justice attorney and notary with whom Alger Hiss had worked, was found dead in the southwest stairwell of the (then) seven- story Justice building. Just after Laurence Duggan's death, the Associated Press reported: > The widow of W. Marvin Smith, a justice department employee who died in a > five story plunge 2 months ago, expressed belief today that his death was > simply an accident. > She told a reporter she feels certain it was not a suicide and was not > connected in any way with his appearance as a minor witness in congressional > hearings.

That was also the opinion of justice officials. > Smith, 53, was an attorney in the solicitor general's office. Last summer, > he figured in a minor way in the house committee on un-American activities. In 1951, the Chicago Tribune newspaper speculated about \\"several suicides and mysterious deaths\\" among spies and government officials mostly related to the Hiss Case, including: James Forrestal, another mysterious death * Nov 1947: John Gilbert Winant (suicide). US ambassador to England, following personal depression * Aug 1948: Harry Dexter White (heart attack) * Oct 1948: W. Marvin Smith (suicide) * Dec 1948: Laurence Duggan (suicide). Regarding Duggan, like Hiss a former State Department official, the newspaper commented, \\"There was speculation that he might have fallen accidentally or that he might have been thrown from the window, but it was widely believe he committed suicide.\\" (Duggan fell sixteen stories with one snow boot on.) * May 1949: James Forrestal (suicide), first US Secretary of Defense * 1949, Morton Kent, another State Department official, committed suicide after his implication in the trial of Judith Coplon * Feb 1950: Laird Shields Goldsborough (suicide). Goldsborough was a senior editor at Fortune and TIME magazines and former boss of Whittaker Chambers: he fell out of a ninth-floor building ‚Äì and left his estate to the Soviet government. * Apr 1950: Francis Otto Matthiessen (suicide). The Harvard professor jumped from the 12 floor of his Boston hotel, according to his sister because of proceedings in the trial of Harry Bridges (defended by Carol Weiss King, who also defended J. Peters, head of the Ware Group). * Nov 1952: Abraham Feller (suicide). The UN legal counsel (and friend of Alger Hiss) jumped out his window when Adlai Stevenson Jr. lost the 1952 presidential elections, UN Secretary General Trygve Lie resigned, and a US grand jury and the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee continued investigations into Americans working at the UN.

It played host to the handball and water polo competitions as well as being the training centre for athletics, swimming and field hockey during the games. Overview The facility is made up of two buildings: the Michel-Normandin arena and the main building itself. At the heart of the facility lies a ten- lane Olympic-size swimming pool and smaller pool with diving towers, home to the award-winning CAMO swim club, as well as an indoor track, an omni-sport training room and a number of gymnasiums. On the grounds lie a number of other installations: a running track, a regulation-sized soccer pitch, a second pitch with an artificial surface, originally designed for field hockey, but resurfaced in 2006 and configured for soccer and Canadian football, tennis courts, baseball diamonds, and so forth. The running track and the large soccer pitch sit in the middle of a 6,500-seat stadium. The facility plays host to many national and international sporting competitions. Yearly events include the Jeux de Montreal and the D√©fi sportif (for handicapped athletes). The facility is also the headquarters for a number of clubs, some of which participate at an elite level, while others, such as Sports Montr√©al and APADOR, provide services to the general public. Montreal's soccer team, the Montreal Impact, also played its home games on the large soccer pitch from 1993 to 2007 and both the professional team and their academy trained there until 2015.

She is the daughter of George Morgan, widow of Keith Whitley, and ex-wife of Jon Randall and Sammy Kershaw, all of whom are also country music singers. Morgan has been active as a singer since the age of 13, and charted her first single in 1979. She achieved her greatest success between 1988 and 1999, recording for RCA Records Nashville and the defunct BNA Records. Her first two RCA albums (Leave the Light On and Something in Red) and her BNA album Watch Me are all certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The 1995 compilation Reflections: Greatest Hits is her best-selling album with a double-platinum certification; War Paint, Greater Need, and Shakin' Things Up, also on BNA, are certified gold. Morgan has made over forty chart entries on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts, including three number-one singles: \\"Five Minutes\\", \\"What Part of No\\", and \\"I Didn't Know My Own Strength\\", along with eleven additional top-ten hits. Morgan has recorded in collaboration with her father, as well as Whitley, Randall, Kershaw, Frank Sinatra, Johnny Mathis, Tammy Wynette, Dolly Parton, Andy Williams, the New World Philharmonic, and Pam Tillis. She is also a member of the Grand Ole Opry. Morgan's musical style is defined largely by country pop influences and her dramatic singing voice, with frequent stylistic comparisons to Tammy Wynette. Early life Loretta Lynn Morgan was born in Nashville, Tennessee, on June 27, 1959. She is the fifth child of country music singer George Morgan. Her mother was Anastasia \\"Anna\\" Paridon Trainor, who died in 2018. At age 13, Lorrie Morgan made her first performance on the Grand Ole Opry, when her father brought her onstage to perform \\"Paper Roses\\". According to Morgan herself, the performance received a standing ovation. Morgan's father died in 1975, so she and the members of his band toured various small clubs until 1977, when they disbanded and she began touring with Roy Wiggins. After this, she worked as a receptionist, songwriter, and demo singer for Acuff-Rose Music. Recording career Morgan's employment at Acuff-Rose led to her signing with that company's Hickory Records label, which issued two singles in 1979: \\"Two People in Love\\" and \\"Tell Me I'm Only Dreaming\\". Respectively, these were written by Eddy Raven and Liz Anderson, and both made the lower regions of the Hot Country Songs charts that year. Another single, \\"I'm Completely Satisfied with You\\", featured electronically overdubbed vocals from her father, and also made the charts by year's end. During the early 1980s, Morgan continued to tour primarily in night clubs, and served as an opening act for Billy ThunderKloud & the Chieftones, Jeannie Seely, and Jack Greene among others. She also toured as a backing vocalist for George Jones, made guest appearances on the television series Nashville Now, and in 1984 became the youngest inductee of the Grand Ole Opry. The same year she issued two singles on MCA Records: \\"Don't Go Changing\\" reached the lower regions of Hot Country Songs, while \\"If You Came Back Tonight\\" did not chart. =1989‚Äì1991: RCA Records= Morgan signed to RCA Records Nashville in 1988 and released her first single for that label, \\"Trainwreck of Emotion\\", that year. The song reached number 20 on the Hot Country Songs chart and served as the lead single to her debut album Leave the Light On. Following this were \\"Dear Me\\" and \\"Out of Your Shoes\\"; these both went top ten on Hot Country Songs, with the latter also reaching the number-one position on the Radio & Records country charts in December 1989. After this song came \\"Five Minutes\\", her first number one on Hot Country Songs, and then another top ten in \\"He Talks to Me\\". Barry Beckett was the album's producer, and contributing songwriters included Mike Reid, Jon Vezner, and Beth Nielsen Chapman. Following the album's last single, RCA also issued \\"'Til a Tear Becomes a Rose\\", a duet between Morgan and Keith Whitley from the latter's Greatest Hits album. The song would later win Vocal Event of the Year from the Country Music Association. Thom Owens of AllMusic reviewed Leave the Light On favorably, calling it \\"a skilled and assured blend of traditional country, honky tonk, country-rock and modern pop sensibilities that pointed the direction toward the sound, style and musical eclecticism of '90s contemporary country.\\" The Chicago Tribune writer Jack Hurst rated the album four out of four stars, referring to it as \\"fine, well-produced songs and a compelling performer\\". In 1993, Leave the Light On earned a platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of one million copies. Her second RCA album Something in Red came out in 1991. Also certified platinum by the RIAA, it accounted for four Hot Country Songs entries between then and early 1992: \\"We Both Walk\\", a cover of George Jones' \\"A Picture of Me (Without You)\\", and \\"Except for Monday\\" all reached top ten, while title track reached number fourteen in early 1992. The album also included a duet with Dolly Parton titled \\"Best Woman Wins\\", which also appeared on the latter's 1992 album Eagle When She Flies. Richard Landis produced the album except for the duet, which Parton produced with Steve Buckingham and Gary Smith. Contributing songwriters included Skip Ewing, Reed Nielsen, and Chris Waters. Brian Mansfield of AllMusic reviewed Something in Red favorably, noting that it had fewer \\"sad songs\\" than its predecessor while highlighting the \\"laidback country and ballads like the title track\\". =1990s: BNA Records= Morgan moved to BNA Entertainment (later known as BNA Records) in 1992. According to Morgan, she chose to move to a different label and hire a new manager because her relationship with RCA personnel had become \\"stale\\". This resulted in her then-manager, Jack McFadden, suing her for $2,000,000 for early termination of contract, and she had to undergo pre- bankruptcy reorganization to counter the fees of the lawsuit. Her first BNA album, Watch Me, came out that same year. The title track was the first single, achieving a peak of number two on Hot Country Songs. The followup \\"What Part of No\\" became her second number-one single on that chart in early 1993; it was also her longest-reigning, holding that position for three weeks. After this came \\"I Guess You Had to Be There\\" and \\"Half Enough\\". The album featured backing vocals from Dale Daniel and The Remingtons, two other acts recording for BNA at the time; Richard Mainegra and Rick Yancey of the latter group also wrote the closing track \\"She's Takin' Him Back Again\\". As with the previous album, Landis again served as producer. Mansfield praised the album as being superior to its predecessors, but criticized \\"What Part of No\\" and Morgan's cover of Bonnie Tyler's \\"It's a Heartache\\". Alanna Nash of Entertainment Weekly rated the album \\"B\\", stating that \\"Morgan is a take- charge singer with more than a little vulnerability beneath her steely surface as well as an ability to adopt pop stylings without straining her country credibility.\\" Watch Me became her third consecutive platinum album by the end of 1993. Morgan released her first Christmas album, Merry Christmas from London, at the end of 1993. The album featured orchestral accompaniment from the New World Philharmonic orchestra, and duets with Tammy Wynette (a medley titled \\"A Christmas Festival\\"), Andy Williams (\\"Little Snow Girl\\"), and Johnny Mathis (\\"Blue Snowfall\\"). Roch Parisien of AllMusic panned the album for lacking in country sound. The album charted two seasonal entries on Hot Country Songs: a rendition of \\"My Favorite Things\\" in late 1993, and of \\"Sleigh Ride\\" two years later. Morgan sang \\"Little Snow Girl\\" with Williams as part of a Christmas special hosted at his Moon River Theater in Branson, Missouri which also aired on the television network PBS, and said that she chose to perform with him because she had been a fan of his music since childhood. A year after the album's release, Morgan began a special holiday tour which featured her performing songs from the album with orchestral backing. She also made her acting debut in this timespan, starting with the 1993 made-for-TV movie Proudheart on the defunct TNN (The Nashville Network). It featured her in the starring role as an assembly-line worker who moves back to a small town in Tennessee after the death of her father. In 1994, she portrayed the lead role in a television pilot for CBS called Lorelei Lee. The show focused on a country music-singing detective, but the pilot was not picked up for series. The following year, she appeared in the ABC TV movie The Stranger Beside Me. BNA issued her next studio album, War Paint, in 1994. The album's singles were unsuccessful on the charts, with \\"My Night to Howl\\" peaking at number 31 on Hot Country Songs, \\"If You Came Back from Heaven\\" failing to reach top 40, and \\"Heart Over Mind\\" stopping at number 39. Despite this, the album was certified gold by the RIAA for shipments of 500,000 copies. War Paint also accounted for Morgan's first writing credits on one of her own albums in the title track and \\"If You Came Back from Heaven\\", the latter of which she wrote as a tribute to Whitley. Also included were two cover songs: Jeannie Seely's \\"Don't Touch Me\\" and George Jones' \\"A Good Year for the Roses\\", which she recorded as a duet with Sammy Kershaw. Thom Owens of AllMusic wrote of the album that the singles \\"hold up really well, but the rest of the album is a little too familiar for comfort.\\" Nash noted Morgan's ability to sing songs with \\"intimacy\\" and \\"attitude\\", but criticized the \\"Native American stereotypes\\" of the title track. By year's end, Morgan had also begun touring as a headlining artist for the first time. In 1995, Morgan released her first Greatest Hits album. It included most of her major hit singles to that point, along with three new tracks which were all issued as singles: \\"I Didn't Know My Own Strength\\" became her third and final number-one hit that year, followed by the top-five \\"Back in Your Arms Again\\", but a cover of Billie Jo Spears' \\"Standing Tall\\" was less successful on the charts. Greatest Hits also became her highest-certified album by the RIAA, reaching double-platinum status for shipments of two million copies. =Late 1990s= Jon Randall sang duet vocals on Morgan's 1996 single \\"By My Side\\"'; the two were also married from 1996 to 1999. Morgan's next album Greater Need was released in 1996. Leading off the singles was the Jon Randall duet \\"By My Side\\", which became Randall's only top 40 hit. The song was originally intended to be a duet with Kershaw, but after his label expressed disinterest, the then-president of Morgan's label suggested that she cut it with Randall. While the followup single \\"I Just Might Be\\" failed to make top 40 on Hot Country Songs, the album's last single \\"Good as I Was to You\\" reached number four in 1997. Morgan said that she wanted the album to show her \\"maturing musically\\" over her previous works. She noted that she had originally declined the album's title track until she was encouraged by Thom Schuyler, a singer- songwriter who was also the president of artists and repertoire (A&R;) at her label at the time, at which point she realized the song was indicative of the musical themes she wanted to pursue on the album. The album included guest vocals from Vince Gill, Travis Tritt, and her son Jesse Keith Whitley. James Stroud produced the album, and contributing musicians included Dann Huff, Paul Franklin, Billy Joe Walker Jr., Glenn Worf, Alison Krauss, and former Toto member David Hungate. Thom Owens of AllMusic, Alanna Nash of Entertainment Weekly, and Jeffrey B. Remz of Country Standard Time all praised the album for its varied sounds, with particular emphasis on its ballads. She also released Shakin' Things Up in 1997. It featured the top-ten hit \\"Go Away\\" and the top-20 single \\"One of Those Nights Tonight\\", but the following singles \\"I'm Not That Easy to Forget\\" and \\"You Think He'd Know Me Better\\" both failed to make top 40. Also included on the album was a cover of The Shirelles' \\"Will You Love Me Tomorrow\\". Morgan held her first co-production credit on the album, doing so with Stroud; backing vocalists on the album included John Cowan, Vern Gosdin, and Randall. Tom Roland of The Tennessean considered the album her strongest since Something in Red, saying that it \\"combines a commanding, upbeat attitude with a few moments of subtle disturbance. And does so flawlessly.\\" Remz highlighted the vocal performance on the Shirelles cover and the single \\"One of Those Nights Tonight\\" in particular, while calling the Bill Anderson composition \\"I've Enjoyed as Much of This as I Can Stand\\" the strongest song. Shakin' Things Up also earned a gold certification. Another album, Secret Love, followed in 1998. This album was composed entirely of cover songs dating largely from the 1940s and 1950s, and produced no singles. Morgan dedicated the album to her father, whom she claims introduced her to such music. Among the songs covered were \\"Fly Me to the Moon\\", \\"I've Got the World on a String\\", and \\"Good Morning Heartache\\". For this album, Landis returned to production duties, while musical accompaniment was largely handled by pianist Beegie Adair and the Nashville String Machine, a session string ensemble. Morgan performed ten concerts in 1998 which promoted the album, with Adair and a small orchestra accompanying her. Charlotte Dillon of AllMusic wrote that \\"her voice and emotional delivery are up to the test, even for old ballads and standards\\", while Nash found her delivery \\"overly dramatic\\". Her last BNA studio album was My Heart in 1999. The only successful single from the album was the Sammy Kershaw duet \\"Maybe Not Tonight\\", which was concurrently issued on Kershaw's 1999 album of the same name, and simultaneously promoted by both BNA and Mercury Nashville, the label to which Kershaw was signed at the time. Audio engineer Csaba Petocz produced the album, except for the Kershaw duet, which was handled by Keith Stegall. Also included on the album was a cover of Bryan Adams' \\"The Only Thing That Looks Good on Me Is You\\", and the Jo Dee Messina duet \\"The Things We Do\\". Contributing songwriters included Robert Ellis Orrall, Leslie Satcher, Trey Bruce, Stegall, and Randall. Tom Roland of The Tennessean found the album's first half stronger than its second half, praising the collaborative songs and Morgan's vocal delivery on \\"Strong Enough to Cry\\", but criticizing the Adams cover. Tom Netherland of Country Standard Time was largely negative toward the album as a whole, criticizing the \\"too-slick production\\" and the lyrics on the ballads in particular. BNA issued a second compilation, To Get to You: Greatest Hits Collection, in 2000. Included on the album, in addition to several more of her hit singles, were covers of Sarah McLachlan's \\"Angel\\" and Tammy Wynette's \\"Another Lonely Song\\". Morgan then ended her contract with BNA at the time of the album's release, with The Tennessean columnist Brad Schmitt noting at the time that the departure from her label was amicable, and was likely spurred by declining sales and creative differences. =2000s= Morgan collaborated with Sammy Kershaw on the 1999 single \\"Maybe Not Tonight\\" and the duets album I Finally Found Someone; the two were also married from 2001 to 2007. In 2001, RCA Nashville (of which BNA was a division at the time) signed both Morgan and Kershaw, who had just ended his tenure with Mercury, to a one- album deal. This deal included the collaborative album I Finally Found Someone, featuring six duets and three solo songs from each artist. Morgan's manager noted at the time that RCA's decision to re-sign her after having previously dropped her from the BNA division was \\"unusual\\". The album's title track was originally recorded by Bryan Adams and Barbra Streisand for the latter's 1996 movie The Mirror Has Two Faces, and Morgan said that she had wanted to record the song after having seen the movie. One single, the duet \\"He Drinks Tequila\\", became Morgan's last top 40 entry on Hot Country Songs that year. Maria Konicki Dinoia of AllMusic showed favor toward the contrast in the two singers' voices, highlighting the more uptempo songs such as \\"He Drinks Tequila\\" in particular. Nash was less positive, calling the album \\"oddly reminiscent of the worst of '80s radio.\\" Morgan signed to Image Entertainment in 2002. Her first project for the label was The Color of Roses, a two-disc compilation featuring live performances of both her hit singles and pop standards accompanied by the Belmont University School of Music Orchestra, recorded on September 1, 2001 at the Tennessee Performing Arts Center in Nashville. The second disc included two studio recordings (the title track and a rendition of Sammi Smith's \\"Help Me Make It Through the Night\\") and a 43-minute interview. Charles Calello and Sandy Linzer produced the project, which was also issued on DVD and VHS. Image also released the studio album Show Me How in 2004. It accounted for her last chart entry, \\"Do You Still Want to Buy Me That Drink (Frank)\\", which peaked at number 50 on Hot Country Songs. Show Me How reunited her with Landis on production duties. James Manheim of AllMusic described her vocals as \\"better than ever\\", while also praising Landis's production and the lyrics. Morgan's eleventh album A Moment in Time was released on October 27, 2009, on the Stroudavarious label. It features fourteen covers of traditional country songs, and duets with Tracy Lawrence and The Mavericks' lead singer Raul Malo. Thom Jurek of AllMusic praised the album's production and song choices, writing that \\"she is jaw-droppingly sincere, and her interpretations of these songs make them her own because of their originality, without sacrificing reverence for the standard versions. \\" In 2010, Morgan released another studio album called I Walk Alone. It included twelve songs that she co-wrote and co-produced, and she described it as occupying \\"a particularly introspective and vulnerable place in her life\\". This was followed in 2014 by Dos Divas, a collaboration album with Pam Tillis. Morgan released a further solo album in 2016, Letting Go...Slow, and a second duets album with Tillis in 2017, Come See Me and Come Lonely. In addition to these albums, Morgan has continued to tour and perform on the Grand Ole Opry in the 2010s. Musical style and influences Morgan's style is defined by her singing voice, and the combination of ballads and uptempo material present in her discography. Robert K. Oermann of The Tennessean described her as a \\"the blonde with the torchy delivery\\", and Alanna Nash called her voice a \\"throaty sob\\". Remz wrote in a review of Greater Need that \\"Morgan's voice always has been her strength, often getting right at the heart of songs of heartbreak and loss, her signature\\", while saying in a review of To Get to You that she \\"turn[s] in readings with a good deal of emotion tossed in without being overwrought. Sometimes the singing is almost too perfect, sacrificing intensity in the process.\\" Nash contrasted her with Tammy Wynette, writing of her first greatest-hits album that it was \\"a reminder that Morgan is capable of delivering the kind of feisty songwriting that harkens back to Wynette‚Äôs halcyon days in the '70s.\\" Morgan also felt that the comparisons to Wynette in her singing style and song choices were helpful in making her music appeal to female fans. Nash has also described Morgan as \\"plainspoken\\", referring to \\"What Part of No\\" as a song that \\"showcases her pull-no-punches style.\\" Writing for The Times of Northwest Indiana, Jim Patterson stated that \\"Like Wynette, Morgan is tough but vulnerable, scarred by tragedy and dogged by the tabloids. And like Wynette, she can make it all come pouring out in her voice.\\" James Manheim of AllMusic said of her songs' themes that they displayed a \\"sense of humor and play to her usual strengths in the genres of the breakup ballad and everywoman barroom encounter song.\\" Other contributions Morgan has contributed to a number of collaborative works. In 1993, she recorded a rendition of Buck Owens' \\"Crying Time\\" for the soundtrack of the film The Beverly Hillbillies, and charted for six weeks on Hot Country Songs with this rendition. She contributed to three multi-artist albums in 1994: the Eagles tribute album Common Thread: The Songs of the Eagles, which featured her covering that band's 1979 song \\"The Sad Caf√©\\"; Frank Sinatra's Duets II, on which she sang a medley of James Ingram and Patti Austin's \\"How Do You Keep the Music Playing?\\" and Sinatra's \\"My Funny Valentine\\"; and Keith Whitley: A Tribute Album, which dubbed her voice with Whitley's on the duet \\"I Just Want You\\". The Beach Boys' 1996 album Stars and Stripes Vol. 1, a collaborative album with several country music artists, featured her on a rendition of \\"Don't Worry Baby\\". Also in 1996, she was one of many artists to contribute to \\"Hope: Country Music's Quest for a Cure\\", a multi-artist charity single sponsored by the T. J. Martell Foundation to promote leukemia research. This song charted on Hot Country Songs for four weeks in mid-1996.Whitburn, p. 168 Personal life Morgan is the widow of Keith Whitley, who died in 1989. Morgan is also known for her turbulent personal life. In a July 2004 appearance on Larry King Live, she told Larry King that \\"drama is something that lets you know you're still alive.\\" Morgan's first husband was Ron Gaddis, a musician in George Jones' road band, to whom she was married from 1979 to 1981. The two had one daughter, Morgan Anastasia Gaddis. Her second marriage was to country music singer Keith Whitley, which lasted from 1986 until Whitley's death from alcohol poisoning in 1989. Of her relationship with Whitley, she said in 1994 that \\"At this point in my life, if I met another Keith Whitley, I would walk away 'cause I don't think I could handle it. But as far as him being The One, yeah, I think we could have lasted forever.\\" They also had one son, Jesse Keith Whitley. In 1991 she married Brad Thompson, a former bus driver for Clint Black, but the two divorced in 1993. During her marriage to Thompson, she suffered from ovarian cysts which led to a hysterectomy. Morgan began dating American football player Troy Aikman in late 1993, but they amicably separated by year's end. From 1994 to 1996, Morgan was romantically linked to actor and politician Fred Thompson. Morgan observed that her relationship with Thompson increased her personal interest in political matters, but also caused her to \\"stop and think about the political implications of everything before I uttered a word in public.\\" She also observed that she wished to marry Thompson, but felt that his political background would keep him from accepting her for who she was. Morgan married country singer Jon Randall in 1996, and a year later, she published an autobiography, Forever Yours, Faithfully: My Love Story. In 1998, tabloids published allegations that Morgan had been spotted in the back of a limousine with Bill Clinton, then the President of the United States, but Morgan dismissed the claims as \\"fabricated\\". Morgan and Randall divorced in 1999. She married her fifth husband, singer Sammy Kershaw, on September 29, 2001. Morgan filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences on October 23, 2007. In 2008, Morgan filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, with an estimated $1 to $10 million in debts. She would later state that her bankruptcy was because she \\"didn't watch [her] own money\\" or audit her accountants. Her sixth marriage took place on September 15, 2010, to Tennessee businessman Randy White.

It also incorporates a large open-air museum with more than 150 buildings, relocated from towns and rural districts. Norsk Folkemuseum Store norske leksikon The Norwegian Museum of Cultural History is situated on the Bygd√∏y peninsula near several other museums, including the Viking Ship Museum; the Fram Museum; the Kon-Tiki Museum; and the Norwegian Maritime Museum. History Norsk Folkemuseum was established in 1894 by librarian and historian Hans Aall (1869-1946). It acquired the core area of its present property in 1898. After having built temporary exhibition buildings and re- erected a number of rural buildings, the museum could open its gates to the public in 1901. In 1907, the collections of King Oscar II, on the neighbouring site, was incorporated into the museum. Its five relocated buildings, with the Gol Stave Church in the centre, is recognized as the world's first open-air museum, founded in 1881. Hans Aall was the director until his death in 1946. Under his leadership the museum experienced a substantial growth of its area, staff, collections, buildings and number of visitors. Reidar Kjellberg (1904-1978) became Director of the museum in 1947 and remained museum director until he retired, in 1974. From 1990 until 2000, Erik Rudeng was the director. The director since 2001 has been Olav Aaraas. Among the museum's more significant buildings are the 13th-century Gol Stave Church, which was incorporated into the Norsk Folkemuseum in 1907. The Gol Stave Church is one of five medieval buildings at the museum, which also includes the 14th-century Rauland farmhouse (Raulandstua) and the 1865 tenement building relocated from 15 Wessels gate in Oslo. Seven of the nine flats show typical interiors from various periods of the 19th and 20th centuries, including a flat inhabited by an immigrant family from Pakistan as it was furnished in 2002. In 1951, the Sami collections in the Ethnographic Museum of the University of Oslo were transferred to the Norsk Folkemuseum. The museum also possesses a large photographic archive, including a significant portion of the works of noted photographer Anders Beer Wilse (1865-1949). In 2004, the administration of the adjacent Bygd√∏y Royal Estate was transferred to the museum. Throughout its existence, research has focused on building and furniture, clothing and textiles, technical and social culture, agriculture, working memory and Sami culture.

The film is based on the 1978 memoir of the same name by Austrian- American author Ingeborg Day. It stars Kim Basinger as Elizabeth McGraw and Mickey Rourke as John Gray. McGraw is a New York City art gallery employee who has a brief yet intense affair with a mysterious Wall Street broker. The film was completed in 1984, but did not get released until February 1986. Considered too explicit by its American distributor, the film was heavily edited for release in the United States,\\"Before 'Fifty Shades,' How '9 1/2 Weeks' Director Put S&M; Onscreen\\", by Seth Abramovitch; The Hollywood Reporter, Feb. 12, 2015. (retrieved October 12, 2019) where it was a box office bomb, grossing $6.7 million on a $17 million budget. It also received mixed reviews at the time of its release. However, it became a huge success internationally in its unedited version, particularly in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, making $100 million worldwide. It has also acquired a large fanbase on video and DVD and has developed a cult following. Plot The title of the film refers to the duration of a relationship between Wall Street arbitrageur John Gray and divorced SoHo art gallery employee Elizabeth McGraw in her early 30s. John initiates and controls the various experimental sexual practices of this volatile relationship to push Elizabeth's boundaries. In doing so, Elizabeth experiences a gradual downward spiral toward an emotional breakdown. Elizabeth first sees John in New York City at a Chinese grocer, and later at a street fair where she decides against buying an expensive scarf. John wins her heart when he eventually produces that scarf. They start dating, and Elizabeth is increasingly subjected to John's behavioral peculiarities; he blindfolds Elizabeth, who is at first reluctant to comply with his sexual demands, but eventually surrenders to them. He gives her an expensive gold watch, and instructs her to use it to think about him touching her every day at noon. She takes this imperative even further by masturbating at her workplace at the designated time. Elizabeth wants to include John in her life and meet her friends, but he makes it clear he only wishes to see her in the evenings, and instructs her to see her friends in the daytime. Elizabeth's confusion about John increases when he leaves her alone at his apartment. She examines his closet until she discovers a photograph of him with another woman, April Tover. John asks her if she went through his things, declaring that he will punish her. He then sexually assaults her. Elizabeth's heightened need for psychosexual stimulation drives her to stalk John to his office. When they have lunch and she mentions she would like to \\"be one of the guys,\\" he arranges for her to crossdress for a rendezvous. On leaving the establishment, two men hurl a homophobic slur when they mistake John and Elizabeth for a gay couple. A fight ensues. Elizabeth picks up a knife from one of the attackers and stabs one of them in the buttocks and both attackers flee. After the fight, Elizabeth reveals a wet tank-top and has sex onsite with John with intensely visceral passion. Following this encounter, John's sexual games acquire sadomasochistic elements. Rather than satisfying or empowering Elizabeth, such experiences intensify her emotional vulnerability. While meeting at a hotel room, John blindfolds her. A prostitute enters the room, and starts caressing Elizabeth as John observes them. The prostitute removes Elizabeth's blindfold and starts working on John. Elizabeth violently intervenes, and flees the hotel, with John in pursuit. They run until they find themselves in an adult entertainment venue. Elizabeth enters a room where a group of men are watching a couple have sex. Elizabeth, visibly upset, notices John watching her, and she starts kissing the man next to her. This affects John, and he moves towards her. Moments later, John and Elizabeth gravitate towards each other, finding themselves interlocked in each other's seemingly inescapable embrace. Elizabeth's exhibition with the artist Farnsworth finally happens, but it is clear she is falling apart. In a sad scene, Farnsworth, clearly uncomfortable at the party, watches Elizabeth hiding in a corner, crying. Elizabeth leaves the party and calls John. The following morning, we see Elizabeth has spent the night at John's. She gets up, and slowly packs her belongings from his apartment. When John realizes she is leaving, he attempts to share with her details about his life. Elizabeth tells him that it is too late as she leaves the apartment. John begins his mental countdown from 50, hoping she will come back by the time he is finished.

In 9¬Ω Weeks: A Memoir of a Love Affair, John engages in criminal behaviour and even coerces Elizabeth into committing a violent mugging in an elevator. The book culminates in a quasi-rape scenario which leaves Elizabeth in mental anguish, and he takes her to a mental hospital-never to return to her again. The film ends on a sombre tone, and there is no mention of the psychiatric breakdown that John inflicted upon his lover, though her mental anguish is increasingly depicted near the end of the film. Release =Critical reception= Weeks has a 61% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 23 reviews. The critical consensus reads: \\"9 1/2 Weeks' famously steamy sex scenes titillate though the drama unfolding between the beddings is relatively standard for the genre.\\". Retrieved 2009-05-10. The film was championed by some critics. Roger Ebert praised the film, giving it three and a half stars out of four, stating: \\"A lot of the success of Weeks is because Rourke and Basinger make the characters and their relationship convincing.\\" He further elaborated by saying that their relationship was believable, and unlike many other characters in other erotic films at that time, the characters in this movie are much more real and human. Over time, some critics have warmed to the film and audiences gave it somewhat of a legacy thanks to its success in the rental market. It performed very well in Europe, particularly in Italy, France and also in Latin America. Its success in France was so strong that it played for five years at a Paris cinema, earning approximately $100 million. In S√£o Paulo, Brazil, it played for 30 months in the cult movie house Cine Belas Artes from 1986 to 1989. =Accolades= The film was nominated for three categories at the 1986 Golden Raspberry Awards, Worst Actress (Kim Basinger, who lost to Madonna for Shanghai Surprise), Worst Original Song (\\"I Do What I Do\\" by Jonathan Elias, John Taylor, Michael Des Barres, which lost to \\"Love or Money\\" from Under the Cherry Moon), and Worst Screenplay (Patricia Louisianna Knop, Zalman King, Sarah Kernochan, which lost to Howard the Duck). The film gained a huge following on home video, and in spite of its reception, both Basinger and Rourke became huge stars. The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists: * 2002: AFI's 100 Years...100 Passions ‚Äì Nominated Music The main single released from the Weeks: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack was \\"I Do What I Do\\", performed by Duran Duran bass guitarist John Taylor, giving his first solo singing performance during a hiatus in Duran Duran's career. The song reached #23 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #42 on the UK Singles Chart. Music for the score was composed by Taylor and Jonathan Elias. Original music for the movie was also written by Jack Nitzsche, but his compositions are not included on the soundtrack. The soundtrack also included tracks from Luba, Bryan Ferry, Dalbello, Corey Hart, Joe Cocker (\\"You Can Leave Your Hat On\\"), Devo, Eurythmics and Stewart Copeland. Winston Grennan's reggae \\"Savior\\" as well as Jean Michel Jarre's \\"Arpegiator\\", played during the sex scene on the stairs in the rain, were not included on the record.

The group runs a school in Pune, the International School Aamby ‚Äì Aamby Valley. Criticism Being a largely unlisted company Sahara India Parivar's activities have in recent times come under criticism. This includes allegations of unknown sources of capital, favourable treatment by political parties. On 26 February 2014, the Supreme Court of India had issues warrants to summon Subrata Roy, Managing Worker, Chairman and founder of Sahara India Pariwar, on a litigation on the Optionally Fully Convertible Debentures issued by the two companies of Sahara India Pariwar to which Securities and Exchange Board of India had claimed its jurisdiction and objected on why Sahara has not taken permission from it. Sahara has claimed that the said bonds are hybrid product, thus does not come under the jurisdiction of SEBI, instead is governed by Registrar of Companies (ROC) under Ministry of Corporate Affairs, from which the two companies of Sahara has already taken permission and submitted the red herring prospectus with ROC before issuing the bonds. SEBI in return ordered Sahara's two companies to stop issuing the said bonds and return money to investors. Sahara contested the case in various courts which eventually came to Supreme Court of India. On 14 June 2012, (during the final hearing of the case), the group had provided details of its financials up to 30 April 2012. While the court reserved its order, Sahara claims that it has already paid to 95% of the investors and discharged its OFCD liability to the tune of and only around are left against which Sahara has already deposited more than which has with interest swelled to . By 31 August 2012 the date of Supreme Court order, the group repaid majority of its OFCD investors between May the last date of hearing and by 30 August 2012 the final order. Since these repayments have not been taken into consideration, Sahara maintains that any money paid now will obviously mean a double payment towards one liability. It is also been reported that Sahara has paid as TDS (tax deducted at source) to the Income Tax Departments on the interest which along with investment was repaid to 95 percent of the investors, between 2009‚Äì10 and 2012‚Äì13. The income tax authorities had found that the beneficiary investors were existent and accordingly confirmed the repayments made in those particular years. One of Sahara's arguments in the apex court revolves around the fact that if one government body has found investors, why can't the other. The case itself comprises big numbers such as collection of over from three crore individuals, while once in 2013 Sahara sent 127 trucks containing 31,669 cartons full of over three crore application forms and two crore redemption vouchers to SEBI office. Apparently, this had resulted into a huge traffic jam on outskirts of Mumbai, where the regulator is headquartered. SEBI on the other hand because the trucks reached after office hours SEBI rejected the second batch of files, which as per Sahara contained 25% of the investor information. Furthermore, the market regulator SEBI advertised four times in more than 144 newspapers to ask the investors of Sahara to refund the money. And since August 2012 Sebi has only refunded to the investors while it has from Sahara. On October 2014, a shocking revelation was made when only around 4,600 investors in two Sahara group companies had come forward to claim refunds from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), which had asked those who had purchased bonds issued by the entities to claim their money. This gave a valid point to Sahara's argument before courts that it had repaid most of the investors who had come forward to claim the investment which they had made in bonds issued by two group companies. Reports also suggested that between the time that SEBI first initiated the inquiry four years ago and Roy's eventual detention and it is to note that till today there is not a single charge against him, there has not been a single instance of an investor in either of the two Sahara firms under watch actually filing a police complaint or going to court. He was granted interim bail by the Supreme Court on 26 March 2014 on the condition that he would deposit the huge bail amount of . Subrata was eventually taken into judicial custody and sent to Tihar jail, along with two other Sahara directors, on 4 March 2014 for failing to deposit with SEBI. In Tihar jail, Subrata unsuccessfully tried to sell some of his hotel properties to raise for his bail bond. He remained in Tihar jail for more than two years, and was released on parole in May 2016 to attend the last rites of his deceased mother. On 1 July 2018, the group revealed that majority of of Sahara's money (including the interest) which is with SEBI will be refunded back to Sahara India as the group had already made majority of the payments to its investors. The group also stated that SEBI will be directed to start the verification of the documents of Sahara's investors, which are already provided to them by Sahara India Pariwar. Despite the double payment for single liability, Sahara India has been continuously depositing money of around Rs 20,000 crore (including interest earned) in Sahara-Sebi account.

Early life and career Trace was the youngest of three children born to Edith (n√©e Morley) and Lawrence Archibald Trace. His two older siblings were Ann and David Morley Trace. Trace was educated at Cranleigh School, a boarding independent school in the town of Cranleigh in Surrey, which he left early. After working as a farm labourer, he joined the British Army and trained at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. Trace received a commission in the Royal Regiment of Artillery of the British Army in 1953. He was promoted to lieutenant in February 1955, but resigned his commission in September 1956. Trace then had a relatively undistinguished acting career ‚Äì his greatest screen role being Charlton Heston's body double in Ben-Hur (1959). Broadcaster At the age of 25, Trace was the first male presenter of Blue Peter from its first programme, broadcast on 16 October 1958, and stayed with the programme until 24 July 1967. According to the BBC, he gained the job as presenter because he bonded with producer John Hunter Blair over their shared love of model railways. During his time hosting Blue Peter, he was also a regular presenter on the BBC Schools programme Signpost from 1961 to 1965. By 1967, the Blue Peter production team were beginning to find Trace hard to deal with and were looking to replace him on the show,\\"Blue Peter\\" 50th Anniversary Book: The Story of Television's Longest-running Children's Programme. Hamlyn particularly when his wife divorced him for sleeping with another woman during a 1965 Blue Peter summer expedition to Norway. The couple had two children. Trace often threatened to resign and once the production team were happy that viewers had accepted John Noakes as a member of the team, Trace's next resignation was accepted. He became a writer and production manager for a film company named Spectator which failed after two years, losing him his life savings. He was declared bankrupt in 1973, then returned to the BBC, first on local television in East Anglia and then on the network TV programme Nationwide. In the 1970s, he worked as a presenter on BBC East's daily morning radio programme Roundabout East Anglia, a regional opt-out from the Today programme on BBC Radio 4. He also appeared on local television as a presenter on BBC's early evening news programme Look East. Later life By the mid-1970s, he had retired from the media, and briefly worked behind the bar of a pub near Norwich before becoming general manager of an engineering factory, where he lost two toes in an accident. On Blue Peter‚Äôs 20th anniversary in 1978 he appeared on the show and the factory shut for the day so that the workforce could watch his appearance. On the show, without warning anyone in advance, he announced that he wanted to give an Outstanding Endeavour Award. The award became an annual Blue Peter event. In the 1980s he worked in the press office of the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families Association (SSAFA). In the 1990s, he briefly returned to the BBC to guest on and later host the nostalgia series Are You Sitting Comfortably? on Radio 2. Death Trace died in 1992 from cancer of the oesophagus while living in Walthamstow. Valerie Singleton and Biddy Baxter visited Trace in hospital just days before his death. Quotations The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography credits Trace with coining two phrases that have become prominent in British popular culture: the line \\"And now for something completely different\\", later taken up by, and usually attributed to, Monty Python, and \\"Here's one I made earlier\\", since adopted by nearly all subsequent presenters on Blue Peter.

He was born in Vancouver, Washington. Simmons was a star pitcher at Burbank High School and Glendale College before enlisting in the U.S. Coast Guard. After World War II, he signed with the Philadelphia Phillies and pitched briefly in their minor league system. Career His radio career began in Elko, Nevada, calling Elko High School football and basketball games on KELK. He first announced baseball for a semipro league in Marysville, California. After spending three years broadcasting Fresno State sports on KMJ, Simmons came to San Francisco in 1957 as the sports director at KSFO. That year, he was the color commentator for the San Francisco 49ers of the National Football League, teaming with play-by- play announcer Bob Fouts, the father of Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback Dan Fouts. In 1958, Simmons took over as play-by-play announcer on 49ers radio broadcasts, paired with former 49er Gordy Soltau. Years later, he worked with KSFO disc-jockey Gene Nelson and then with former NFL player and KPIX-TV sports director Wayne Walker. Also in 1958, he became the second announcer for the newly relocated San Francisco Giants of Major League Baseball, teaming with lead announcer Russ Hodges, who moved with the team from New York. To complement Hodges' \\"Bye Bye Baby!\\" home run call, Simmons created his own, \\"Tell It Goodbye!\\" When Hodges retired after the 1970 season (he died in April 1971), Simmons was promoted to lead announcer and teamed with Bill Thompson. This pairing lasted through the 1973 season. Al Michaels and Art Eckman became the Giants radio announcers on KSFO in 1974. =Famed \\"wrong-way\\" football call= Simmons' most famous call during his first stint with the 49ers came on October 25, 1964, when Minnesota Vikings defensive end Jim Marshall picked up a fumble by the 49ers' Billy Kilmer and ran it the wrong way, scoring a safety for the 49ers instead of a touchdown for the Vikings (who won the game anyway, by a score of 27-22). The transcript of his call, including his mid- sentence transition as the moment occurred, reads as: =Later career= Simmons returned to the Giants in 1976 as second announcer behind Michaels, then was the lead announcer again in 1977 and 1978, teaming with San Francisco native Joe Angel. When KSFO lost the Giants radio rights to rival KNBR in 1979, Simmons and Angel were replaced by Lindsey Nelson and Hank Greenwald. Three years later in 1981, KSFO acquired the Oakland Athletics' radio rights. Simmons then became an A's announcer, along with longtime Oakland Raiders and San Francisco/Golden State Warriors voice Bill King and youngster Wayne Hagin. Simmons remained part of the A's radio team through the 1995 season. From 1996 to 2002, he called Giants games part-time on KNBR. With the 49ers, he remained as play-by-play announcer through the 1980 season. In 1981, KSFO lost the 49ers radio rights to KCBS, who replaced him with its own sports director, longtime Stanford University play-by-play announcer Don Klein. Simmons also served as the Warriors TV announcer on KTVU during the 1973‚Äì74 NBA season. During the final two games of the 1989 World Series, Athletics lead announcer Bill King came down with laryngitis. Simmons was thus able to announce to his radio audience that the A's had won the World Series over Simmons' former team, the Giants. During Simmons' first tenure as 49ers play-by-play announcer, the team never won an NFL championship. One year after his departure, San Francisco began a run of Super Bowl victories. When KGO acquired the 49ers radio rights in 1987, Simmons returned as the play-by-play announcer and was reunited with long-time colleague, Wayne Walker. During the 1988 regular season, Simmons' call of Steve Young's breathtaking game-winning 49-yard scramble against the Minnesota Vikings became as memorable as the play itself. The following January, San Francisco won Super Bowl XXIII over the Cincinnati Bengals, 20-16. Simmons' call of the 49ers' Super Bowl game-winning drive (punctuated by a Joe Montana-to-John Taylor TD pass) can be heard on the NFL Films highlights package of the game. Simmons again departed from the 49ers ‚Äî this time for good ‚Äî during the 1989 preseason following a dispute with the KGO management. He was replaced in the play-by-play spot by Joe Starkey, the long-time announcer for the University of California Golden Bears and sideline reporter on 49ers games in 1987 and 1988; Starkey had taken over play-by-play on several October games during the 1988 season. Starkey retired from the position following the 2008 NFL season. =Coast Guard service= Simmons served in the U.S. Coast Guard for 3-1/2 years during World War II. He initially served on a cutter in Hawaii mostly conducting submarine patrols. During the Battle of Saipan, he served on a landing ship, tank (LST-205) that landed troops and supplies as part of the invasion.Hometown Heroes website. \\"Remembering Lon Simmons\\", April 11, 2015.

Simmons' trademark call for home runs, \\"Tell it goodbye!,\\" is quoted by John Fogerty in his song, Centerfield. In May 2006, Simmons rejoined the San Francisco Giants as a fill-in broadcaster. He was hired back to be in the booth during four in-season trips to San Francisco from his home in Maui for the 2006 baseball season. The Giants radio booth at Oracle Park is named after him and Hodges.

Today it encompasses a wide range of perspectives that are critical of traditional theories of management and the business schools that generate these theories. History It is generally accepted that CMS began with Mats Alvesson and Hugh Willmott's edited collection Critical Management Studies (1992). Critical Management Studies (CMS) initially brought together critical theory and post- structuralist writings, but has since developed in more diverse directions. A dominant narrative within CMS is that perhaps the most important development in its stimulation was the global expansion of business schools, an American invention, especially in Europe. Decreases in state funding, so the narrative has it, for social sciences and increases in funding for business schools during the 1980s resulted in many academics with graduate training in sociology, history, philosophy, psychology and other social sciences ending up with jobs \\"training managers\\". These academics brought different theoretical tools and political perspectives into business schools. They began to question the politics of managerialism and to link the techniques of management to neo- liberalism. These new voices drew on the Frankfurt School of critical theory, and the work of Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida and Gilles Deleuze. Later Feminism, queer theory, post-colonial theory, anarchism, ecological philosophies, and radical democratic theory also had some influence. (See Alvesson and Willmott 2003 for a survey of the field.) The roots of CMS also came from a series of UK Labour Process Conferences that began in 1983 and reflected the impact of Braverman's (1974) attempt to make Marxist categories central to understanding work organisations. Industrial relations and labor studies scholars have joined the CMS fold in the US, seeking new opportunities for employment as labor-related programs have diminished in number. At the same time a significant strand of critical accounting studies began to develop marked by the publication of Tony Tinker's Paper Prophets (1985) and the appearance of the journal Critical Perspectives on Accounting. Contrasting with the dominant origin narrative is an account which states that, along with the contributors to CMS from the intellectual traditions identified here, there is a significant - and overlapping - bloc among CMS scholars of those who have had extensive pre-University experience as workers and managers. The inconsistencies between their experiences in the workplace and the claims of mainstream managerialism, and an intention to connect those experiences to broader explanations and theorizing leads these people to CMS. Geographical base The main home of CMS has been in the organisation theory and behaviour parts of British, Australian and Scandinavian business schools,Engwall, L. 2004. The Americanization of Nordic management education. Journal of Management Inquiry, 13: 109‚Äì117. though there are strong contributions in related fields such as sociology, sociology of education, and critical pedagogy.Perriton, L. & Reynolds, M. 2004: Critical Management Education From Pedagogy of Possibility to Pedagogy of Refusal? Management Learning 35, 61-77 Further, contributions stem from accounting with growing interest in other management specialisms, such as marketing, international business, operational research, logistics etc. Since the 1990s academics from North America and other parts of the world are also engaging with this body of writing and research. The CMS Division within the (American) Academy of Management (AoM), with a membership of around 800, is larger and more international than some of its other divisions. Many heterodox scholars in various parts of the world had been inspired by the international activities of the Standing Conference on Organisational Symbolism. This latter grouping developed work which drew variously on post-structuralism and symbolic interactionism in order to develop a cultural and anthropological understanding of contemporary organizations. Others, though, were without affiliation and/or seeking new formations and alliances. Since 1999, there has been a bi-annual CMS conference held in the UK as well as workshops and a bi-annual conference held at US Academy of Management. Today there are significant concentrations of CMS scholars in the UK at the School of Business and Management at Queen Mary, University of London, at the School of Management at the University of Leicester, the Essex Business School at the University of Essex, Alliance Manchester Business School at the University of Manchester, and the Marketing Research Group at Royal Holloway. Elsewhere, Copenhagen Business School, Lund School of Economics and Management at Lund University and Istanbul Bilgi University have clusters of CMS scholars, but many CMS scholars globally rely on conferences and journals like Tamara Journal for Critical Organization Studies, ephemera: theory and politics in organization, Culture and Organization, or Organization: the critical journal of organization, theory and society for their affiliations. Controversy and debate Major points of debate have focused on CMS's relationship with more orthodox forms of Marxism, on the nature and purposes of CMS critique, on questions of inclusion and exclusion (Fournier and Grey 2000), on the possibilities of social transformation from within business schools (Parker 2002), and on the development of alternative models of globalisation. One trend in CMS has seen the incorporation of autonomist Marxist theory, first introduced to the English-speaking world by the work of Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri (2000). New CMS scholars using these theories have interests in proposing alternative non-capitalist forms of organizing work and life - often built around the notion of collective responsibility for the commons. Other developments include engagements with post-colonial theory and critical race theory to investigate the way management and business schools contribute to what Cedric Robinson (1983) has called \\"racial capitalism\\". Recent critical works have referred to Bourdieusian theory (structuralist constructivism)Bourdieu, P., & Passeron, J. C. 1977. Reproduction in education, society and culture.

Michael Loughlin of Manchester Metropolitan University has discussed aspects of management theory as \\"pseudo- science\\". For example: Wider impatience with market-managerial forms of organization occur commonly enough outside the business school, from anti- corporate protests to popular-media presentations of managers. CMS attempts to articulate these voices within the business school, and to provide ways of thinking beyond current dominant theories and practices of organizations.

This event was the catalyst for the Second Crusade.  Background  The County of Edessa was the first of the crusader states to be established during and after the First Crusade. It dates from 1098 when Baldwin of Boulogne left the main army of the First Crusade and founded his own principality. Edessa was the most northerly, the weakest, and the least populated; as such, it was subject to frequent attacks from the surrounding Muslim states ruled by the Ortoqids, Danishmends, and Seljuk Turks. Count Baldwin II and future count Joscelin of Courtenay were taken captive after their defeat at the Battle of Harran in 1104. Joscelin was captured a second time in 1122, and although Edessa recovered somewhat after the Battle of Azaz in 1125, Joscelin was killed in battle in 1131. His successor Joscelin II was forced into an alliance with the Byzantine Empire, but in 1143 both the Byzantine emperor John II Comnenus and the King of Jerusalem Fulk of Anjou died. John II was succeeded by his son Manuel I Comnenus, who had to deal with consolidating power at home against his elder brothers, while Fulk was succeeded by his wife Melisende and his son Baldwin III. Joscelin had also quarreled with Raymond II of Tripoli and Raymond of Antioch, leaving Edessa with no powerful allies.  The siege of Edessa In 1144, Joscelin was able to make an alliance with Kara Arslan, the Ortoqid ruler of Diyarbakƒ±r, against the growing power and influence of Zengi. Joscelin marched out of Edessa with almost his entire army to support Kara Aslan against Aleppo. Zengi, already seeking to take advantage of Fulk's death in 1143, hurried north to besiege Edessa, arriving on November 28. The city had been warned of his arrival and was prepared for a siege, but there was little they could do while Joscelin and the army were elsewhere. The defense of the city was led by the Latin Archbishop Hugh, the Armenian Bishop John, and the Jacobite Bishop Basil bar Shumna. John and Basil ensured that none of the native Christians would desert to Zengi. When Joscelin heard of the siege he took the army to Turbessel, knowing that he could never dislodge Zengi without help from the other crusader states. In Jerusalem, Queen Melisende responded to Joscelin's appeal by sending an army led by Manasses of Hierges, Philip of Milly, and Elinand of Bures. Raymond of Antioch ignored the call for help, as his army was already occupied against the Byzantine Empire in Cilicia. Zengi surrounded the entire city, realizing that there was no army defending it. He built siege engines and began to mine the walls, while his forces were joined by Kurdish and Turcoman reinforcements. The inhabitants of Edessa resisted as much as they could, but had no experience in siege warfare; the city‚Äôs numerous towers remained unmanned. They also had no knowledge of counter-mining, and part of the wall near the Gate of the Hours collapsed on December 24. Zengi's troops rushed into the city, killing all those who were unable to flee to the Citadel of Maniaces. Thousands more were suffocated or trampled to death in the panic, including Archbishop Hugh. Zengi ordered his men to stop the massacre, although all the Latin prisoners that he had taken were executed; the native Christians were allowed to live freely. The citadel was handed over on December 26. One of Zengi‚Äôs commanders, Zayn ad-Din Ali Kutchuk, was appointed governor, while Bishop Basil, apparently willing to give his loyalty to whoever ruled the city, was recognized as leader of the Christian population.  Aftermath  In January 1145 Zengi captured Saruj and besieged Birejik, but the army of Jerusalem had finally arrived and joined with Joscelin. Zengi also heard of trouble in Mosul, and rushed back to take control. There, he was praised throughout Islam as \\"defender of the faith\\" and al-Malik al-Mansur, the victorious king. He did not pursue an attack on the remaining territory of Edessa, or the Principality of Antioch, as was feared. Joscelin II continued to rule the remnants of the county to the west of the Euphrates from Turbessel, but little by little the rest of the territory was captured by the Muslims or sold to the Byzantines. Zengi was assassinated by a slave in 1146 while besieging Qalat Jabar, and was succeeded in Aleppo by his son Nur ad-Din. Joscelin attempted to take back Edessa following Zengi's murder, and recaptured all but the citadel in October 1146. However, he had no help from the other crusader states, and his poorly planned expedition was driven out of Edessa by Nur ad-Din in November. Joscelin, fearing for the safety of the city's Christian Armenians, attempted to break a hole in Nur ad- Din's forces through which the natives could flee to safety. However, Joscelin's attempt failed and his fears came true when Nur al-Din's troops massacred the fleeing Armenians and forced the survivors into slavery. By this time, news of the fall of Edessa reached Europe, and Raymond of Antioch had already sent a delegation including Hugh, Bishop of Jabala, to seek aid from Pope Eugene III. On December 1, 1145 Eugene issued the papal bull Quantum praedecessores calling for the Second Crusade. This crusade was led by Louis VII of France and Conrad III of Germany, but by 1148 it had ended in disaster, and Edessa was never recovered. In October 1146, Joscelin retook Edessa, but his victory lasted only a matter of days. Nur ad-Din quickly besieged the city and forced Joscelin to abandon it. The Christian population was massacred, enslaved or exiled and the city lost its importance. References  Sources  * Steven Runciman, A History of the Crusades, vol.

Some claimed ongoing encounters, while others claimed to have had as few as a single encounter. Evidence is anecdotal in all cases. As a cultural phenomenon, contactees perhaps had their greatest notoriety from the late 1940s to the late 1950s, but individuals continue to make similar claims in the present. Some have shared their messages with small groups of followers, and many contactees have written books, published magazine and newspaper articles, issued newsletters or spoken at UFO conventions. The contactee movement has seen serious attention from academics and mainstream scholars. Among the earliest was the classic 1956 study, When Prophecy Fails by Leon Festinger, Henry Riecken, and Stanley Schachter, which analyzed the phenomenon. There have been at least two university-level anthologies of scientific papers regarding the contactee movements. Contactee accounts are generally different from those who allege alien abduction, in that while contactees usually describe positive experiences involving humanoid aliens, abductees rarely describe their experiences positively. Overview Astronomer J. Allen Hynek described contactees as asserting that: > \\"the visitation to the earth of generally benign beings whose ostensible > purpose is to communicate (generally to a relatively few selected and > favored persons) messages of 'cosmic importance'. These chosen recipients > generally have repeated contact experiences, involving additional messages . > . .\\"Hynek, J. Allen (1972). The UFO Experience: A Scientific Inquiry, p. 5. > Henry Regnery Company. . Contactees became a cultural phenomenon in the 1940s and continued throughout the 1950s and 1960s, often giving lectures and writing books about their experience. The phenomenon still exists today. Skeptics often hold that such \\"contactees\\" are deluded or dishonest in their claims. Susan Clancy wrote that such claims are \\"false memories\\" concocted out of a \\"blend of fantasy- proneness, memory distortion, culturally available scripts, sleep hallucinations, and scientific illiteracy\\".Clancy, Susan (2005). Abducted, Harvard University Press, . Contactees usually portrayed Space Brothers as more or less identical in appearance and mannerisms to humans. The Brothers are also almost invariably reported as disturbed by the violence, crime, and wars that infest the earth, and by the possession of various earth nations of nuclear and thermonuclear weapons. Curtis Peebles summarizes the common features of many contactee claims:Peebles, Curtis (1994). Watch the Skies: A Chronicle of the Flying Saucer Myth, pp. 93‚Äì108. Smithsonian Institution, . * Certain humans have had physical or mental contact with seemingly benevolent, humanoid space aliens * The contactees have also flown aboard seemingly otherworldly spacecraft and traveled into space and to other planets * The Space Brothers want to help mankind solve its problems, to stop nuclear testing and prevent the otherwise inevitable destruction of the human race * This will be accomplished very simply by the brotherhood spreading a message of love and brotherhood across the world * Other sinister beings, the Men in Black, use threats and force to continue the cover-up of UFOs, and suppress the message of hope History of contactees =Early contactees= Though the word contactee was not in common use until the 1950s, the authors of the anthologies noted in \\"sources\\" below use the term to describe persons whose claims occurred centuries before the modern UFO era began in the late 1940s, attempting to depict them as a part of the same tradition. Though not linked to flying saucers or odd aerial lights, it is perhaps worth noting that there is a long history of claims of contact with non-earthly intelligences. The founding revelations of many of the world's religions involve contact between the founder and a supernatural source of wisdom, such as a deity in human form or an angel. In this context, one might expect that the 1950s contactees would form their own religions, with the contactee as sole spiritual leader, and that is precisely what many of them did. As early as the 18th century, people like Emanuel Swedenborg were claiming to be in psychic contact with inhabitants of other planets. 1758 saw the publication of Concerning Earths in the Solar System, in which Swedenborg detailed his alleged journeys to the inhabited planets. J. Gordon Melton notes that Swedenborg's planetary tour stops at Saturn, the furthest planet discovered during Swedenborg's era‚Äîhe did not visit then unknown Uranus, Neptune or Pluto.Melton, Gordon J., \\"The Contactees: A Survey\\". In Levin, ed. (1995) The Gods Have Landed: New Religions From Other Worlds, pp. 1‚Äì13. Albany: University of New York Press. . Later, Helena Blavatsky would make claims similar to Swedenborg's. In 1891, Thomas Blott's book The Man From Mars was published. The author claimed to have met a Martian in Kentucky. Unusually for an early contactee, Blott reported that the Martian communicated not via telepathy, but in English.Melton, p. 7. Another early contactee book, of sorts, was From India To The Planet Mars (1900) by Theodore Flournoy. Flournoy detailed the claims of Helene Smith, who, whilst in a trance, dictated information gleaned from her psychic visits to the planet Mars‚Äîincluding a Martian alphabet and language she could write and speak. Flournoy determined that Smith's claims were spurious, based on fantasy and imagination. Her \\"Martian\\" language was simply a garbled version of French. =1900s= Two of the earliest contactees in the modern sense were William Magoon and Guy Ballard (the latter a follower of Madame Blavatsky). Magoon's book William Magoon: Psychic and Healer was published in 1930. He claimed that, in the early 20th century, he had been unexpectedly and instantaneously transported to Mars. The planet was essentially earth-like, with cities and wilderness. The inhabitants had radio and automobiles. Though they were invisible, Magoon sensed their presences. Though Magoon was obscure, Ballard would have more impact via the I Am movement he established. In 1935, Ballard claimed that, several years earlier, he and over 100 others witnessed the appearance of 12 Venusians in a cavern beneath Mount Shasta. The Venusians played music for the audience, said Ballard, then showed the crowd a large mirror-like device that displayed images of life on Venus. The Venusians then allegedly reported that the earth would suffer through an era of tension and warfare, followed by worldwide peace and goodwill. George Adamski, who later became probably the most prominent contactee of the UFO era, was one contactee with an earlier interest in the occult. Adamski founded the Royal Order of Tibet in the 1930s. Writes Michael Barkun, \\"His [later] messages from the Venusians sounded suspiciously like his own earlier occult teachings.\\"Barkun, Michael (2003). A Culture of Conspiracy: Apocalyptic Visions in Contemporary America. Los Angeles: University of California Press, Berkeley. Christopher Partridge notes, importantly, that the pre-1947 contactees \\"do not involve UFOs\\".Partridge, Christopher. \\"Understanding UFO Religions and Abduction Spiritualities\\". In Partridge, Christopher (2003) ed. UFO Religions (2003), p. 8. London: Routledge. , Rather, he suggests that an existing tradition of extraterrestrial contact via seances and psychic means promptly incorporated the flying-saucer mythos when it arrived. =Contactees in the UFO era= The 1947 report of Kenneth Arnold sparked widespread interest in flying saucers, and before long, many people were claiming to have been in contact with flying saucer inhabitants. There was a nearly-continuous series of contactees, beginning with George Adamski in 1952. Radio host \\"Long John\\" Nebel interviewed many contactees on his program during this era. The stereotypical contactee account in these days involved not just conversations with friendly, humanoid spacemen, but also tours inside their flying saucers, and rides to large \\"Mother Ships\\" in Earth orbit, and even jaunts to the Moon, Mars, Venus, Jupiter and Saturn. In support of their claims, early 1950s contactees often produced photographs of the alleged flying saucers or their occupants. A number of photos of a \\"Venusian scout ship\\" by George Adamski and identified by him as a typical extraterrestrial flying saucer were noted to suspiciously bear a remarkable resemblance to a type of once commonly available chicken egg incubator, complete with three light bulbs which Adamski said were \\"landing gear\\". For over two decades, contactee George Van Tassel hosted the annual \\"Giant Rock Interplanetary Spacecraft Convention\\" in the Mojave Desert.ArticleFortean Times Magazine Another 1950s contactee, Buck Nelson, held a similar convention in the Ozarks of Missouri up until 1965. Response to contactee claims Even in ufology‚Äîitself subject to at best very limited and sporadic mainstream scientific or academic interest‚Äîcontactees were generally seen as the lunatic fringe, and \\"serious\\" ufologists subsequently avoided the subject, for fear it would harm their attempts at \\"serious\\" study of the UFO phenomenon.Sheaffer, Robert (1986). The UFO Verdict: Examining the Evidence, p. 18. Prometheus Books. Sheaffer, Robert (1998). UFO Sightings: The Evidence, pp. 34‚Äì35. Prometheus Books. Jacques Vall√©e notes, \\"No serious investigator has ever been very worried by the claims of the 'contactees'.\\"Vallee, Jacques (1965). Anatomy of a Phenomenon: Unidentified Objects in Space, A Scientific Appraisal, p.90. Henry Regnery Company. . Carl Sagan has expressed skepticism about contactees and alien contact in general, remarking that aliens seem very happy to answer vague questions but when confronted with specific, technical questions they are silent: > Occasionally, by the way, I get a letter from someone who is in \\"contact\\" > with an extraterrestrial who invites me to \\"ask anything\\". And so I have a > list of questions. The extraterrestrials are very advanced, remember. So I > ask things like, \\"Please give a short proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.\\" Or > the Goldbach Conjecture. And then I have to explain what these are, because > extraterrestrials will not call it Fermat's Last Theorem, so I write out the > little equation with the exponents. I never get an answer. On the other > hand, if I ask something like \\"Should we humans be good?\\" I always get an > answer. I think something can be deduced from this differential ability to > answer questions. Anything vague they are extremely happy to respond to, but > anything specific, where there is a chance to find out if they actually know > anything, there is only silence.Carl Sagan, The Burden of Skepticism Some time after the phenomenon had waned, Temple University historian David M. Jacobs noted a few interesting facts: the accounts of the prominent contactees grew ever more elaborate, and as new claimants gained notoriety, they typically backdated their first encounter, claiming it occurred earlier than anyone else's. Jacobs speculates that this was an attempt to gain a degree of \\"authenticity\\" to trump other contactees.Jacobs, David M. (1975). The UFO Controversy In America. Indiana University Press. .

The park is also used for the ROPSSAA football finals and the PSAA (Private Schools Athletic Association) on the first Monday of May for an annual Track and Field Meet. The stadium is named for the city park it is located in, which opened during Canada's centennial year of 1967; the stadium was opened in 1975, eight years after the centennial. It is located within Centennial Park (Toronto) in the Etobicoke district, just south of Toronto Pearson International Airport and near the intersection of Rathburn Road and Renforth Drive. It was built in 1975. The stadium hosted the first edition of Veteran Athletes Championships in 1975 as well. The stadium hosted the closing ceremony of the 1976 Summer Paralympics and some of the sporting events. The stadium has seating in a grandstand on the west side and a small scoreboard on the north end of the field. The stadium is home to the Toronto Lynx soccer clubs (men's and ladies'). It hosts the Relay For Life in Toronto West event each June, a fundraiser for the Canadian Cancer Society. The stadium hosted the CPSL/CSL Championship finals in 1998, 2010, 2011, and 2014. In 2017, there were calls and support for the stadium to be renamed after former Mayor Rob Ford as Rob Ford Memorial Stadium, but a city council meeting voted down the motion on October 4, 2017.

Primarily used for soccer, rugby, football, and athletics, the stadium also used to be home to the Simon Fraser Clan football team and the Vancouver Whitecaps while they were in the Canadian Soccer League (CSL) and various US-based Division 2 leagues. It opened on April 26, 1969, and has a capacity of 5,288. History In 1969, Vancouver Sun sports journalist Erwin Swangard raised nearly $1 million for the construction of an athletic stadium in Central Park in Burnaby, British Columbia. BC Premier W. A. C. Bennett officially named the stadium after Swangard at its opening on April 26, 1969. Swangard was not present on the day of the opening, having been sent to start a newspaper in Nigeria. =Vancouver Whitecaps= The city of Vancouver launched a professional soccer team in 1986, named the Vancouver 86ers (now known as the Whitecaps). The Canadian Soccer League (CSL) club began playing in 1987 and made Swangard Stadium their home pitch. The stadium served its last season as the Whitecaps' home in 2010, as the club joined Major League Soccer (MLS) in 2011. As Swangard does not meet MLS standards for capacity, the City of Burnaby initially proposed to keep the team in Burnaby by renovating the stadium and expanding its capacity to 20,000 seats. This plan, however, fell through, and the Whitecaps eventually decided they wanted to move to a new, larger soccer-specific home at the Whitecaps Waterfront Stadium. Currently the Whitecaps are playing at BC Place Stadium and president of the organization, Bob Lenarduzzi has stated the club intends to stay at BC Place for the time being and plans for a new stadium are all on hold. =International events= The stadium's capacity was temporarily increased to 10,000 for the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup. In the past, it has hosted home games for the Canadian men's and women's soccer teams in Olympic and World Cup qualifying. In some cases, crowds in excess of 10,000 have witnessed games, with many of the fans standing. Swangard has also been the host stadium of the 2002 FIFA U-19 Women's World Championship. =Other events= In 2013, the Vancouver Riptide, a professional ultimate team competing in the American Ultimate Disc League, became a tenant of Swangard Stadium but they ended play at end of 2017 season and are being moved to Portland, Oregon for the 2020 season. In June 2014, Simon Fraser Clan announced that Swangard Stadium will be their football team's home field for the 2014 season. The Clan returned to their campus again starting with the 2016 season. Swangard Stadium is also used very frequently for track and field meets in the Lower Mainland. In March 2015, the first Quidditch Canada National Championship took place at Swangaurd Stadium. The TSS FC Rovers of the USL League Two play their home soccer games at Swangard Stadium. They started in the 2017 season, playing in the Northwest Division. The TSS FC Rovers Women's Team of the Women's Premier Soccer League also use the stadium as their home, they started play in the 2017 season.

There are binary versions available for most popular Linux distributions (including Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, Suse, Gentoo, Slackware, Arch Linux, Mandriva and Mageia). There are also ports for BSD, and it will run under Solaris and IRIX. It has been compiled under OS X Leopard, but not thoroughly tested on that platform.LiVES 1.3.10 VJ Software on MAC OSX (Unix/Darwin) (English), Alza Tu Voz Linux. In early 2019, a version for Microsoft Windows was announced, with a release slated for in the second half of 2019. Development The main developer of LiVES is Gabriel Finch (a.k.a. Salsaman), who is also a video artist and international VJ. The project began in late 2002, and the 1.0.0 version was released in July 2009. On the Freecode site, LiVES is listed as the most popular non-linear video editing software.824 projects tagged \\"Video\\" ‚Äì Freecode LiVES was nominated for the category of Best Project for Multimedia in the Sourceforge Community Choice Awards 2009. The LiVES application allows the user to manipulate video in realtime and in non-realtime. The application also has features which go beyond traditional video editing applications - for example, it can be controlled and monitored remotely over a network, and it has facilities for streaming to and from another copy of LiVES. It is resolution and frame rate independent. LiVES uses a system of plugins for effects, decoders, encoders and video playback. The APIs for these are now well defined, and the application can be easily extended. Interface LiVES has two main interfaces: the clip editor, which serves as a repository of video and audio material, and the multitrack window, where multiple clips can be positioned on the timeline. The clip editor allows free playback at variable play rates, applying of multiple realtime effects and mixing of clips. This mode is mainly used by VJs. Video editors can also use this interface to prepare the clips before entering into multitrack mode. In multitrack mode, the individual clips can be arranged in layers on the timeline. Further effects and transitions can be applied here, and the audio can be mixed down. The entire timeline can then be rendered, creating a new clip. Rendering previews are shown in real time. Features The LiVES Multitrack Window LiVES' features include: * Near-instant opening for most audio / video formats via libav. * Smooth playback at variable frame rates, forward and in reverse. Display frame rate can be controlled independently of playback frame rate. * Frame accurate cutting and pasting within and between clips. * Saving/re-encoding of clips, selections, and individual frames. * Lossless backup/restore. * Streaming input and output. * Real time blending of clips (various chroma and luma blends). * Ability to edit many file types and sources including remotely located files (with mplayer/ffmpeg libraries), and directories of images (rotoscoping). * Real time capture/recording of interactive (via mouseclicks) external windows. * Encode to any of the 50+ output formats which are now supported (e.g. mjpeg, mpeg4, mpeg1/2, h264, webm, VCD, SVCD, DVD, x264/Blu-ray, ogg/mp4 ogm, Matroska mkv, dv, swf, Ogg Theora, Dirac, MNG, Snow, xvid, Flash and even animated GIF and PDF) * Resampling of video (time stretching) to any frame rate (1 to 200 frame/s - accurate to 8 decimal places); option to auto-resample or speed up/slow down between clips. * Rotation, resizing and trimming of video clips. * Deinterlacing, subtitle removal. Auto deinterlacing for dv can be enabled. * Can load mp3, vorbis, mod, it, xm and wav audio files. * LiVES can also load audio tracks directly off CD to use with video. * Sample accurate cutting and pasting of audio within and between clips. * Resampling of audio (rate, channels, sample size, signedness and endianness); audio is auto-resampled between clips. * Able to record from any external audio source. * Fade in/fade out feature for clips. * Audio speed and direction can be smoothly adjusted; both in real time and when rendering. * Hundreds of effects, including random/targeted zooming, panning of video, colour cycling and colorisation/colour filtering and colour correction. * LADSPA support for audio effects. * Merging/compositing of frames is possible: e.g. frame-in- frame, fade in/out and transparency. * Real time previews when rendered effects are processing. * Support for the Frei0r 1.1 and 1.2 effect plugin architectures, libvisual plugins, and projectM plugins. * Multiple real time effects are possible during playback (VJ mode), these can also be rendered to frames. * Multitrack window with drag and drop and configurable auto- transitions. * Intelligent screen organisation - shows you only the information which is relevant, no more and no less * Support for an almost limitless number of tracks and effects * Non-destructive editing in the multitrack window, with multiple levels of undo/redo. * Full automation/interpolation of effect parameters. * Support for stereo backing audio track + stereo audio track per video track * Automatic gain control for rendering multiple audio channels * Realtime mixing/previewing of audio * Channel mixer volume control + fine grained, time variable per-channel volume and pan control. * Auto-transitioning of audio with video (selectable). * Full crash recovery. * Configurable multi-monitor screen placement. * Simple and intuitive menu layout. * Drag and drop interface. * Remote monitoring and control (via Open Sound Control) of the application can be enabled. * VJ functions can be controlled via keyboard, joystick or MIDI controller. * I18N text support.

From 1974 to 1998 he was the editor of the magazine The American Scholar. Biography Epstein was born in Chicago, Illinois in 1937. He graduated from Senn High School and attended the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign. He received a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Chicago and served in the U.S. Army from 1958 to 1960. From 1972 to 2002, he was a lecturer in English and Writing at Northwestern University and is an Emeritus Lecturer of English there. From 1974 to 1998 he served as editor of The American Scholar and wrote for it under the pseudonym Aristides. He edited The Best American Essays (1993), the Norton Book of Personal Essays (1997), and Literary Genius: 25 Classic Writers Who Define English & American Literature (2007). His work has appeared in The Atlantic, Commentary, Harper's, The New Criterion, The New Republic, The New York Times Book Review, The New Yorker, The Wall Street Journal, The Weekly Standard, and First Things. His short stories were included in The Best American Short Stories 2007 and The Best American Short Stories 2009. In 2003, he was awarded a National Humanities Medal by the National Endowment for the Humanities. Epstein's removal as editor of The American Scholar in 1998 (following a 1996 vote of the Phi Beta Kappa senate) was controversial. Epstein later said that he was fired \\"for being insufficiently correct politically\\". Some within Phi Beta Kappa attributed the senate's decision to a desire to attract a younger readership for the journal. Epstein's essay \\"Who Killed Poetry?\\", published in Commentary in 1988, generated discussion in the literary community decades after its publication. In September 1970, Harper's Magazine published an article by Epstein called \\"Homo/Hetero: The Struggle for Sexual Identity\\"Joseph Epstein, Homo/Hetero: The Struggle for Sexual Identity, Harper‚Äôs Magazine, September 1970 that was criticized for its perceived homophobia.Larry P. Gross & James D. Woods, The Columbia Reader on Lesbians and Gay Men in Media, Society, and Politics (Columbia University Press, 1999), , p. 595. Excerpts available at Google Books. Epstein wrote that he considered homosexuality \\"a curse, in a literal sense\\" and that his sons could do nothing to make him sadder than \\"if any of them were to become homosexual.\\"Christopher Bram, Eminent Outlaws: The Gay Writers Who Changed America (Hachette Digital, 2012), , p. 142. Excerpts available at Google Books. Gay activists characterized the essay as portraying every gay man the author met, or fantasized about meeting, as predatory, sex-obsessed, and a threat to civilization. In the essay, he says that, if possible, \\"I would wish homosexuality off the face of the earth\\", a statement that was interpreted by gay writer and editor Merle Miller as a call to genocide. A sit-in took place at Harper's by members of the Gay Activists Alliance.Larry P. Gross, Up from Invisibility: Lesbians, Gay Men, and the Media in America (Columbia University Press, 2001), , pp. 43ff. Excerpts available at Google Books. In 2015 Epstein wrote an article for The Washington Examiner in which he mentioned the Harper's article from 1970. He wrote, \\"I am pleased the tolerance for homosexuality has widened in America and elsewhere, that in some respects my own aesthetic sensibility favors much homosexual artistic production... My only hope now is that, on my gravestone, the words Noted Homophobe aren‚Äôt carved.\\"See also Claude Summers, \\"Author Fears 'Noted Homophobe' Will Be Carved on His Gravestone\\" \\"The New Civil Rights Movement,\\" 17 July 2016: url=http://www.thenewcivilrightsmovement.com/claude_summers/the_sad_case_of_joseph_epstein?recruiter_id=833168 William F.

He defined a virtucrat as \\"any man or woman who is certain that his or her political views are not merely correct but deeply, morally righteous in the bargain.\\" In his 2016 essay collection Wind Sprints, he defines it as a person \\"whose politics lend them the fine sense of elation that only false virtue makes possible.\\" Selected works =Essay collections= * Familiar Territory: Observations on American Life (1979) * Middle of My Tether: Familiar Essays (1983) * Plausible Prejudices: Essays on American Writing (1985) * Once More Around the Block: Familiar Essays (1987) * Partial Payments: Essays on Writers and Their Lives (1988) * A Line Out for a Walk: Familiar Essays (1991) * Pertinent Players: Essays on the Literary Life (1993) * With My Trousers Rolled: Familiar Essays (1995) * Life Sentences: Literary Essays (1997) * Narcissus Leaves the Pool: Familiar Essays (1999, paperback 2007) * In a Cardboard Belt!: Essays Personal, Literary, and Savage (2007) * Literary Genius: 25 Classic Writers Who Define English & American Literature (2007) (Illustrated by Barry Moser) * Essays in Biography (2012) * A Literary Education and Other Essays (2014) * Masters of the Games: Essays and Stories on Sport (2015) * Wind Sprints: Shorter Essays (2016) * The Ideal of Culture: Essays (2018) =Other non-fiction= * Divorced in America: Marriage in an Age of Possibility (1974) * Ambition: The Secret Passion (1980) * Snobbery: The American Version (2002) * Envy (2003) * Friendship: An Expos√© (2006) * Alexis de Tocqueville: Democracy's Guide (2006) * Fred Astaire (2008) * Gossip: The Untrivial Pursuit (2011) * Distant Intimacy: A Friendship in the Age of the Internet (with Frederic Raphael) (2013) *Charm: The Elusive Enchantment (2018) =Short-story collections= The title is an allusion to Karl Shapiro's 1941 poem; see =Short stories= * \\"My Brother Eli\\", appearing in The Best American Short Stories 2007 pp. 85‚Äì112 * \\"Beyond the Pale\\", appearing in The Best American Short Stories 2009 pp. 41‚Äì59 References External links * .

Part of a musical dynasty, he grew up in a Polish-speaking household. biography in Polish from the official Chopin.pl site He taught at the Moscow Conservatory from 1922 to 1964. He was made a People's Artist of the RSFSR in 1956. His piano textbook The Art of Piano Playing (1958) is regarded as one of the most authoritative and widely used approaches to the subject. The house where Heinrich Neuhaus was born, Kirovohrad, formerly, Elizavetgrad Life and career Neuhaus was born in Elisavetgrad, then part of the Russian Empire, known since 2016 as, Kropyvnytskyi, in present-day Ukraine. Although both his parents were piano teachers, he was largely self-taught. A major influence on his early artistic development came from his neighbour and cousin through his mother, Olga, \\"Marta\\" n√©e Blumenfeld, Karol Szymanowski. He himself was tutored by Heinrich's father, Gustav Neuhaus. Another strong influence was his uncle, Felix Blumenfeld on the latter's visits to his sisters' home in the locality.Marek Jerzy Minakowski. Potomkowie Sejmu Wielkiego, family trees of Blumenfeld/Korwin Szymanowski/Neuhaus families http://www.sejm- wielki.pl/b/psb.1456.1 (retrieved 2018.12.12] He also received lessons from Aleksander Micha≈Çowski.J. Methuen-Campbell, Chopin Playing from the Composer to the Present Day (Gollancz, London 1981), 73. At the age of eleven, Neuhaus made his first public appearance, performing an impromptu and some waltzes by Fr√©d√©ric Chopin. In 1902 he gave a recital in Elisavetgrad with the 11-year- old Mischa Elman and in 1904 gave concerts in Dortmund, Bonn, Cologne and Berlin. Subsequently, he studied with Leopold Godowsky in Berlin and from 1909 until the outbreak of World War I took part in his master classes at the Vienna Academy of Music. In 1912, Neuhaus attended a concert in Berlin in which Arthur Rubinstein premiered Szymanowski's Piano Sonata No. 2, and left a suicide note saying that the concert had made clear to him that he would never be successful as a composer or a pianist and that he could not go on living, and was going to Florence in Italy to die. Szymanowski and Rubinstein hastily followed Neuhaus to Florence and tracked him down to a hospital, where he was safe and recovering after cutting his wrist in a hotel. In 1914 Neuhaus started teaching in Elisavetgrad and later Tbilisi and Kiev where he befriended Vladimir Horowitz. After a temporary paralysis, Neuhaus was forced to halt his concert career and turned to teaching instead. In 1922 he began teaching at the Moscow Conservatory where he helped to create the famous Moscow Central Music School for gifted children in 1932. In addition, he also served as director of the Moscow Conservatory between 1934 and 1937. When the Germans approached Moscow in 1941, he was imprisoned on suspicion of being a German spy, but released eight months later under pressure from Dmitri Shostakovich, Emil Gilels and others. His pupils there included, Yakov Zak, Sviatoslav Richter, Emil Gilels, Victor Eresko, Anatoly Vedernikov, Tikhon Khrennikov, Galina Melikhova, Yevgeny Malinin, Lev Naumov, Tamara Guseva, Margarita Fyodorova, Ryszard Bakst, Teodor Gutman, Vera Gornostayeva, Alexander Slobodyanik, Leonid Brumberg, Igor Zhukov, Oleg Boshniakovich, Anton Ginsburg, Valery Kastelsky, G√©rard Fr√©my, Zdenƒõk Hn√°t, Eliso Virsaladze, Alexei Lubimov, Aleksey Nasedkin, Vladimir Krainev, Berta Maranz, Evgeny Mogilevsky, Amalya Baiburtyan, Radu Lupu, Valentina Kamen√≠kov√°, Victor Derevianko, Vera Razumovskaya, Nina Svetlanova, Boris Petrushansky and Yuri Krechkovsky. Neuhaus died in Moscow on 10 October 1964. Legacy Neuhaus was renowned for the poetic magnetism of his playing and for his artistic refinement. He was a lifelong friend of Boris Pasternak, and Osip Mandelstam expressed his admiration for Neuhaus's playing in a poem. Stanislav Neuhaus, Heinrich's son by his first wife Zinaida, who later married Pasternak in 1931, was also a noted pianist. Stanislav Bunin is his grandson.

Middle Island is a small island, just in area. It is the southernmost point of land in Canada, located at 41¬∞41'N, 82¬∞41\\"W (41.685,-82.684), or about 41.7 degrees north latitude. It lies in Lake Erie, just south of Pelee Island, and is part of Point Pelee National Park. It forms part of the province of Ontario. The southernmost part of the island lies some from the U.S. maritime boundary. The distance to the northernmost point of land in Canada‚ÄîCape Columbia, Ellesmere Island‚Äîis . The southernmost point of Middle Island is at a latitude of North 41¬∞40'53\\", which is at a slightly lower latitude than the southernmost point in Michigan and slightly farther south than downtown Chicago. Twenty-seven U.S. states lie fully or partly north of this point, as do European cities such as Rome and Barcelona and Asian cities such as Sapporo. Thirteen states are entirely north of this latitude (Alaska, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine). California, Nevada, and Utah, albeit only their northernmost edge, are amongst the states that lie partially north of Middle Island, as their northern border is at the 42nd parallel north. Oblique view of Middle Island Background There are no permanent settlements on Middle Island, as the entire island is a conservation area. The most common species are double- crested cormorants, though several others also nest there. The birds are so plentiful that in May 2008, Parks Canada attempted to cull the number of cormorants from more than 4,000 nests to between 400 and 800. It once was the site of a lighthouse, built in 1872 but which fell into disuse by 1918. The pyramidal square tower burned sometime afterward, but its stone foundation is visible. Located in Canadian waters, and hence indisputably under Canadian sovereignty, the island was privately owned for years by various U.S. owners. Subsequently, Middle Island was purchased in 1999 by the Nature Conservancy of Canada, and then donated to the Canadian national park system on September 6, 2000. Archaeological evidence from a study done in 1982 suggests human occupation dating from 1000‚Äì1500 A.D., with one site containing remains that may date to 500 B.C. Others claim that the island has seen inhabitation for more than 10,000 years. Despite early rumours of burial mounds, none were found. The island is part of an archipelago across western Lake Erie, providing a natural migratory corridor for birds and other animals. It has also seen human migrations, mainly from the U.S. northward in the 19th century, including escaped slaves, prisoners of war and army deserters from the U.S. Civil War seeking asylum in mainland Ontario. Throughout the later decades of the 19th century, parts of Middle Island were used for growing grapes to be used in the production of wine, as was being done on Pelee Island. During Prohibition, the island was a way station for alcohol en route to the United States on the south shore of Lake Erie. Gangster Joe Roscoe acquired part of the island and built a seven-bedroom \\"clubhouse\\" that became the centre of rum-running activity. The hotel offered electricity, fireplaces, and a large screened-in porch with views of the lake. The basement held a casino, carved out of solid bedrock. In the years after 1933, after the ratification of the Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution resulted in the repeal of the Volstead Act, the hotel drew as many as 200 visitors a day in peak season. Its kitchen became known for pheasant dinners. Likely prior to the 1950s, there was an airstrip of about 275 metres (900 feet) in length. The runway began and ended in water, and is now choked with vegetation. There was at one time a stately mansion on the island, rumoured to be a brothel some time after Prohibition. Only a remnant of the foundation remains. When purchased in 1999 by the Nature Conservancy of Canada, the island had no physical improvements and had essentially become a nature preserve over the last ten years, hosting the occasional scientific visit, and curious boaters. Although part of Point Pelee National Park, Middle Island is not officially open to visitors. Interest in preserving the island prompted a 1982 study by Parks Canada, which recommended naming it a national natural landmark. Its ecological, historical, and aesthetic value led Essex County to include it on its list of Environmentally Sensitive Areas and an Area of Natural and Scientific Interest. A conservation group, Carolinian Canada Coalition, named Middle Island one of 38 critical unprotected sites in its effort to preserve remnants of Ontario's southern forests.

He was executed by the Germans. Communist organizer Joseph Epstein was born in Zamo≈õƒá, Congress Poland. He studied law at Warsaw University. There he became aware of the Communist Party of Poland, and later he joined it. In 1931, he was arrested by the police after speaking at a communist rally, but he was released after a few weeks. He fled to Czechoslovakia, where he sought asylum, but his plea was rejected. Epstein returned to Poland, only long enough to be deported by the authorities. In Tours (France), where he organized immigrant laborers, Epstein met and married Paula Grynfeld, a Jewish pharmacy student from the city of ≈Å√≥d≈∫ in Poland. When the French police were informed by the Polish consulate about his participation in the Communist Party, Epstein was arrested and forced to leave Tours. He and his wife traveled to Bordeaux, where they continued their studies. He organized students into a collective, and he was appointed to the regional committee of the French Communist Party. In 1933, they moved to Paris. The following year, Epstein passed his final examination, and he completed his law degree; however, he was barred from practicing law because he was not French. Armed struggle In 1936, Epstein joined the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War and took part in the defence of Irun where he was severely wounded. In January 1938, he commanded the Romanian communists' artillery battery \\"Tudor Vladimirescu\\". On returning to France at the end of 1938, he was imprisoned at Gurs,Gurs at www.ushmm.org a detention camp for political refugees and members of the International Brigades. In 1939, he entered the ranks of the Polish Army, but later resigned and joined the French Foreign Legion. In 1940, he was captured by the Germans and sent to the Stalag IVB prisoner-of-war camp. Epstein escaped from the camp and went to Switzerland, but was deported to Germany. He managed to obtain false papers on the name of Joseph Duffau and moved to Paris. With the French Resistance In 1941, he began working with Francs-Tireurs et Partisans (FTP), a communist resistance group; by February 1943, he was an operation commander in the Paris region. He proposed a new guerrilla warfare tactic. Up till this point, the FTP had been operating in three-person cells: one person attacked and two provided covering fire for their escape. He proposed that the teams should have 10 to 15 fighters. Three or four would throw grenades or bombs, and the rest would cover their withdrawal. The FTP knew that a formation of Wehrmacht soldiers would take part in a parade in a street leading to place de l'√âtoile. Epstein's group decided to attack with twelve men. Three of them would attack with grenades while the other nine would secure their withdrawal. Dozens of soldiers were killed or wounded but only one partisan was wounded. German officers reported that their soldiers were attacked by about a hundred guerillas. In late 1943, the FTP was betrayed, possibly by Joseph Davidovitch, who was a chief of personnel in Missak Manouchian's group. Davidovitch had been arrested by the Gestapo and then released. He claimed, however, that he had escaped. On October 16, 1943, Epstein was arrested in √âvry-Petit-Bourg during a meeting with Manouchian. He was tortured in Fresnes prison and tried along with nineteen other members of the FTP and sentenced to death. He was executed by firing squad.

It consists of a handle (ken), a pair of cups (sarado), and a ball (tama) that are all connected together by a string. On one end of the ken is a cup, while the other end of ken is narrowed down, forming a spike (kensaki) that fits into the hole (ana) of the tama. The kendama is the Japanese version of the classic cup-and-ball game, and is also a variant of the French cup-and-ball game bilboquet. Kendama can be held in different grips, and the tricks and combinations that can be done are limitless. The principle of these toys is the same: catching one object with another, where both are joined by a string. The origins of kendama are disputed, but it is generally believed to have originated during the 17th or 18th century. Kendama started to evolutionize when it came to Japan during the Edo period, and since then the use of the toy has spread throughout the world. The size and materials used to create kendamas now vary as they are offered in jumbo and mini sizes, and have been created out plastic, metal, and nylon. There are now kendama competitions held in countries all over the world, the biggest competition being the annual Kendama World Cup in Japan. Structure and Terminology Anatomy of kendama The kendama is traditionally made out of wood and comprises the following parts: # Main body . # Spike . # Big cup . # Base cup . # Small cup . # Tama . # Hole . # String . # Cup body . # Small cup edge . # Big cup for lunars . # Slip-stop or slip grip . # Back end . # String attachment hole . # Bead (not pictured) = Stringing a Kendama = \\"Stringing\\" a kendama is the action of connecting all 3 pieces of the kendama (ken, sarado, and tama) together. A bead (or mini bearing) and a piece of string are required to string a kendama. The steps to string a kendama are as follows: # Take one end of the string and put it through the little hole in the tama until the string is coming through the big hole (ana). # Put the bead on the end of the string coming out of the ana and tie a knot to lock the bead in. # Put the untied end of the string through one of the two holes in the sarado. (Note: For a right handed kendama, hold the sarado up so that the big cup is on the right side and put the string through the hole that is facing self. For a left handed kendama, make sure the big cup is on the left side and put the string through the hole facing self). #Lead the string through the hole in the ken. # Tie a knot at that end of the string so the string doesn't slip through the ken piece. # Put the sarado down on top of the ken. A video of this process can be found hereKen Grip (top left), Sara Grip (top right), Candle Grip (bottom left), Tama Grip (bottom right) = Grips = A kendama can be held in numerous types of grips. Choosing the type of grip to hold the kendama depends on which trick a person wants to perform. Some of these grips include: *Ken grip: Hold the ken with all five fingers with the spike pointing upwards and the big cup (or small cup) facing towards the body *Sara grip: hold the ken by placing the thumb and index finger below the intersection of the sarado and ken. **Sara grip (stabilized): In addition to the thumb and index finger placement, Place the middle and ring finger underneath the small cup or big cup (this depends on which way the ken is facing). *Tama grip: With the fingertips, hold the ball (tama) with the hole (ana) facing upwards. *Candle grip: Face the ken with the spike pointed downward. Hold the ken with three fingers: index, middle, and the thumb.  How to Play  The general concept of kendama is pulling the ken up and balancing the tama somewhere on the ken, or vice versa. There are not any specific rules on how to play kendama. However, bending the knees while playing kendama is a method that experts use. Endless tricks and trick combinations can be made with just ken grip, sara grip, tama grip, and candle grip by themselves or together in a combination. Some examples of tricks in each of these grips are as follows: = Ken Grip = Spike: This trick involves the hole in the tama and the spike. # Hold the ken with the spike pointing straight up # Hold the ball with the off hand to ensure the ball is still before starting the motion of this trick # Bend the knees # Pull the tama up with the entire body # Catch the ball in the spike by directing the spike underneath the hole in the tama Swing Spike: a variation of the Spike. # Hold the ken in a way similar to preparing a spike # Hold the ball with the opposite hand and slightly bring it back towards the body, keeping the tension in the string # Let go of the ball and swing the ball out in front of self # Tug the string a bit to make the ball rotate the hole 360¬∞ towards self # Catch the tama on the spike by connecting the spike and the hole together. Around Japan: This trick is a combination of the big cup, small cup, and the spike. # Pull the ball up into the small cup # Hop the ball over to the big cup by rotating the wrist to the right (and vice versa if left handed) # Keep an eye on the hole, and hop the ball up onto the spike, connecting the hole and spike together Note: The following combination is also ok: big cup‚Üísmall cup‚Üíspike. Note: This trick can also be done in sara grip. Around the World: Similar to Around the Block, with the addition of the spike. # Follow all the steps from \\"Around the Block\\" # Keep an eye on the hole, and from the bottom cup, hop the ball up and catch the ball by landing the hole on to the spike Both of these tricks can also be done in \\"sara grip.\\" Bird: This trick involves the ball, the hole, the spike, and the big cup or small cup edge. # Hold the ken with the spike facing upwards with the big cup (or small cup) facing towards self # Tilt the kendama slightly away from self # Bend the knees, and extend them while pulling the ball straight up # Balance the hole of the ball on the big cup edge (or small cup edge) while the ball leans against the spike = Sara Grip = Moshikame: This is a tricky combination of the big cup and bottom cup. 1\\\\. Pull the ball up into the big cup 2\\\\. Bend the knees and hop the ball up into the air 3\\\\. While the ball is in mid-air, rotate the ken downwards so that the bottom cup is facing up 4\\\\. Catch the ball in the bottom cup. Clack back: This trick uses the big cup (or small cup) and the end of the handle. # Pull the ball up onto the big cup # Lean the ken about 45¬∞ downward so that the basecup turns starts to face toward the ground, causing the ball to start to fall off the big cup # \\"Clack\\" (hit) the ball with the back end of the ken # Catch the ball on the big cup = Tama Grip = Airplane: This trick involves the hole in the ball and the spike. \\"Airplane\\" mirrors the movement pattern of \\"Swing Spike.\\" # Hold the ball with the hole facing upwards # Grab the ken with the off hand to stabilize it # With the offhand, slightly pull the ken back # Release the ken with the off hand # Pull ken in mid-air so it rotates 180¬∞ towards self, making the ken face downwards # Catch the spike in the hole Lighthouse: This trick involves the base cup and the ball. # Hold the ken steady with the off hand to stabilize it # Pull the ken gently upwards, having the ken rise above the tama and ensuring the ken stays stable throughout the movement # Place the ball under the bottom cup as the ken rises higher than the ball # Balance the ken on top of the ball = Candle Grip = Candlestick: This trick involves the base cup. # Pull _or_ swing the ball upwards onto the bottom cup History =Origins, Precursors, and Parallels= alt= The origins of the game are disputed. It is believed by some to be a variant of the French ball- and-cup game bilboquet (bil \\"ball\\" boquet \\"small tree\\"), a toy that dates back to the 16th century and was popular in Europe during the 17th century. During that same period the kendama is believed to have arrived in Japan via the Silk Road from China during the Edo period (1600-1868), with some scholars specifying that it arrived between 1778 and 1779. Hatsukaichi City in Hiroshima Prefecture is considered to be the birthplace of the modern Japanese Kendama due to the city becoming the first place for kendama manufacturing. Hamagatsu Ekusa created the shape of the kendama that is widely recognized today in 1919 in Kure city and during the early 20th century the toy had two side cups and was called a jitsugetsu ball ., literally translating to \\"sun and moon ball.\\" In the early 20th century, the toy had two side cups and was called a jitsugetsu ball . This translates to \\"sun and moon ball\\", named so because of the ball's representation of the sun and the cups' likeness to the crescent moon. = Models = Despite not being originated in Japan, the shape of kendama that is known today was formed and evolved in Japan. The dates of when the following 3 kendama models were made or seen are undocumented: \\"Deer horn and ball\\" was the form that the kendama took on when it arrived in Japan for the first time, literally a deer horn attached to a ball. Later on, some people replaced the deer horn with a piece of bamboo due to deer horn costing too may resources, making the bamboo and ball. The next model started to resemble what the kendama looks like today: the ken and ball. This model was a ken piece strung to the ball. The jisugetsu ball kendama model was the first model made by Ekusa (1919), and later went on to be produced as many as 300,000 times in one year by Hongo woodworking factory in Hatsukaichi (1921). The jisugetsu has a similar design as lined folk craft kendamas, which were made by factories that also produced Kokeshi dolls from spinning lathe machines. The strings of both the jisugetsu ball and folk craft kendamas were placed on the ken using a loose metal fitting, making the string prone to detaching or breaking. The S (Shinma)-Type kendama was the first competition style kendama invented in 1975 by Hideo Shinma, the president of the Tokyo Kendama Club. The first S-type prototype emerged in 1976, and the Japan Kendama Association (JKA) asked Shinma to make them a competition style model based on the S-Type design in 1977. The F (Fujiwara)-Type (F16) kendama emerged in 1978, invented by Issei Fujiwara. The F-Type incorporated new modifications unknown to kendamas at the time. The F-Type had two small holes drilled in the middle of each side of the sarado, and also used a sturdier string that was unlikely to break. The two string holes in the sarado offer more fluidity of play as well as the option to switch the kendama between left handed or right handed. The Tortoise kendama by Tortoise, Inc. was a take on the S-type kendama after the S-type discontinued in 1990. Tortoise kendamas came in different models: the T-8, T-14, T-16, and T-17. The numbers indicating each different Tortoise model corresponds with the height of each model in centimeters. Tortoise kendamas stopped production in 2012 due to not having enough resources. The F16-2, the second version of the F16, was released in 2001. The main change in the F16-2 from the F16 is that the position of the string hole was moved slightly off from the cup body's center, enabling the kendama to turn and rotate in a new fluid way. This string hole adjustment is still used in various shapes of kendamas to this day. Contemporary Culture Kendama has increased in popularity since its initial evolution in Japan. During the 2000s, kendama surged in popularity outside Japan, which influenced the creation of the first kendama companies in foreign countries. The first kendama company in the United States was Kendama USA in 2006. They began to promote kendama in North America and were able to reach the winter sports, bmx, and rollerblading communities. Since its founding, Kendama USA has spread kendama nationwide and continues to do so. In 2010, the company Sweets Kendamas was founded in the USA in Minnesota by Matt \\"Sweets\\" Jorgenson. Sweets Kendamas' mission is to \\"Spread Kendama Love,\\" and they also have done that over the years. As for the European kendama scene, some kendama companies that emerged in the late 2000s were Kendama Europe in 2008. Kendama Europe's first competition model kendama came out in 2011, and they have worked to spread kendama throughout Germany by attending the Nuremberg-Germany toy fair. Another company that emerged in the late 2000s was KROM Kendama from Denmark in 2010. Almost every kendama company has a team of sponsored players to help promote their brands. Sponsored players range in age and location around the world. The kendama community connects through social media platforms such as Instagram, Youtube, Facebook, Tiktok, Twitch and Twitter. =Robotics= Kendama play has also been used as a measure of accuracy, agility, and learning ability in robotic arms. Rules There are no specific rules on how to play kendama. However, all forms of kendama competition are regulated by rules. 4 styles of kendama competition are speed ladder, open division, freestyle, and Kendama World Cup (KWC). It is rare that the KWC style of competing is used as an event other than KWC itself. = Speed Ladder = The speed ladder is a style of competition is a race of who can finish a set of tricks the fastest. Players will race through an order of tricks that they are given at the event or prior to the event via the internet. The players who finish the trick ladder the fastest wins. There are divisions that sign up to compete in based on their skill level (ex: beginner, intermediate, and advanced/pro). = Open Division = Open Division is a head-to-head 1vs1 competition style format. Each round, 2 players compete against each other and take turns drawing a trick at random. Each trick drawn warrants a maximum of 3 exchanges - the number of times the players can go back and forth attempting the trick. The first player to 3 points wins. *If a player completes the trick and the other player misses, the successful player earns 1 point and the other player draws another trick. * If both players complete or miss the trick, then the 1st exchange comes to an end and the first player gets another attempt to complete the trick in the 2nd bout, restarting the process. ** If both players complete or miss the trick in all 3 bouts, then the trick is discarded and the second player draws a new trick Note: In the final round, the first player to 5 points wins. Note: The labeled champion of each event is usually referring to the Open Division winner. = Freestyle = Freestyle is a head-to-head 1vs1 style of competition. Each match is judged by a panel of 3 or 5 judges. The 2 players competing against each other in each round will take turns performing tricks in 45 second time periods twice each. During the time periods, both players may perform any trick that they choose. Each judge individually decides which player wins based on who did the best in the following 3 categories: Creativity, Consistency, and Difficulty. The player with the most votes wins the round. = KWC = 120 tricks are released online prior to the KWC and are split up into groups of 10 tricks each 12 times, forming a level 1- level 12 trick list. The higher level a trick is, the more difficult it is and the more points it is worth. KWC is split into 2 days of competition: Day 1: Qualifying & Day 2: Finals. Each day has its own set of rules. During Day 1, all players choose 12 tricks from the levels 1-10 in the trick list. Players split the 12 tricks into two rounds of 6 tricks each, and each player will get 3 minutes for each round to complete as many tricks as possible. The 25 players with the highest point scores will advance to Day 2. Note: The number of points each trick is worth is equivalent to the face value of the level of the trick. (ex. level 6 trick is worth 6 points). During Day 2, the players compete one by one from the lowest scoring qualifying player to the highest scoring qualifying player. Each player has 3 minutes to do an unlimited number of tricks from levels 3-12, and each trick can only be done once. The player who gets the highest number of points in their time period wins. Note: The number of points each trick is worth is equivalent to the level of that trick squared (ex. level 6 trick is worth 36 points), with the exception of level 11 tricks (worth 151 points) and level 12 tricks (worth 194 points). Competitions Kendama competitions have been occurring since 1979, with the first competition being the All Japan Kendama-Do Championships held by the Japan Kendama Association. The British Kendama Association was the first group to hold a formal kendama contest outside Japan in 2008 at the British Juggling Convention in Doncaster. Kendama competitions have taken a variety of formats including speed ladders, freestyle, head-to-head, and world championship style. Typically at these events, there are vendors that sell kendamas, clothing, and accessories. Competitions can range from 1‚Äì3 days long and prizes are provided for the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place winners of each competition category. Popular competitions include the North American Kendama Open & the Kendama World Cup (KWC). = Kendama World Cup = Starting in 2014, the Kendama World Cup (KWC) is an annual 2-day event in the summer that takes place in Hatsukaichi, Hiroshima, Japan and is the largest kendama competition in the world. In 2018 alone, the KWC had an audience of 49,000 members that were watching 415 competitors from 18 different countries compete for the title of Kendama World Champion. At KWC, there is also an abundance of vendors selling their merchandise and kendamas, kendama games, and live performances all spread out over the 2 days of the event. Admission to the KWC is free.

The NAKO has developed in length over the years, going from a one day event in 2013-2014, to a two day event in 2015-2017, to a 3 day event in 2018-2019. The event has been hosted all over Minnesota - in 2013 it was held in Saint Paul, in the years 2014-2018 it was held in the Mall of America in Bloomington, and in 2019 it was hosted in Minneapolis at the Varsity Theater. The forms of competition that the NAKO offers are as follows: * Beginner speed ladder * Intermediate speed ladder * Amateur open division * Pro Open Division * Freestyle Each style of competition is split up into different times across each day of the event, so a portion of every competition is completed by the time each day ends. On the final day, a champion is crowned in all divisions.

Using a new format to determine the best freestyle skills in the world, the Catch & Flow defined a new way to perform freestyle kendama and to judge such style. Players from around the world apply to participate by listing their achievements. The top approx. 60 players are selected to perform for 90 seconds one by one. Judges determine 16 finalists who will go head to head with 2 x 45sec for each player in 1 on 1 battle towards the final.

The event is currently hosted by Kentucky-based kendama company Sol Kendamas. The event occurs on the first weekend of January in Tennessee, USA. In June 2011, the first public Kendama competition (battle) was held in the state of Tennessee. The event occurred in the city of Nashville hosted by a kendama blog called the \\"Kensession Stand\\". The event was called the \\"Nashville Kendama Battle\\", and was held at 12th South Taproom. In subsequent years, a group of kendama players called The Kendama Squad (Chad Covington, Nicholas Bellamy, and John Ross Rudolph) -- alongside the Kensession Stand (Tyler Marshall) -- hosted annual kendama battles in Clarksville, Tennessee. While the competition continued to occur annually, the name \\"Battle at the Border\\" was not implemented until the 2014 competition. In 2015, Sol Kendamas began officially coordinating the event. In 2015, the competition reached its largest attendance (approximately 150 people). Battle at the Border (2015-2016) was held in Nashville, Tennessee on the first weekend of January at Rocketown. Battle at the Border (2017-2018) was held on the first weekend of January at The Foundry in Nashville, TN. Battle at the Border returned to Rocketown and has continued to be hosted there since.

These included: * Two pretentious society matrons (Ingleton and Kenneally) and a third (Krape) who could never quite make the grade much to the delight of the other two who mocked her. Catchphrase: \\"Helloo Daaaahlings!\\" * The Dodgy Brothers (Blackburn and Brooks), two badly dressed and dim businessmen who appeared in low-budget and badly produced television advertisements selling their dodgy products. Partly a parody of the then ubiquitous advertisements for the Saba furniture warehouse, and other cut-rate advertisements of its ilk. * \\"Brainspace\\", a new-age segment presented by Tim and Debbie (Kenneally and Blackburn), whose convoluted and pretentious talk was a smokescreen for their ignorance. Their main catchphrase was \\"Amaaazing!\\" * Mock advertisements for fictional product \\"Chunky Custard\\". Most of these were parodies of familiar contemporary advertisements for real products, mimicking current commercials for such products as Big M or Four'N Twenty Pies. Halfway through the second series Chunky Custard was phased out and replaced by \\"Hot Yak Fat\\", which came in a can resembling a beer can. Viewers were exhorted to \\"crack a Fat today\\" (a play on a common Australian slang term for a penile erection). * Many parodies of then-popular songs and music videos, including Mary Kenneally as Bonnie Tyler in \\"Total Eclipse of the Brain\\". * Bruce Rump (Brooks), a parody of Bruce Ruxton.

Mesoamerican pyramids form a prominent part of ancient Mesoamerican architecture. Although similar in some ways to Egyptian pyramids, these New World structures have flat tops (many with temples on the top) and stairs ascending their faces. The largest pyramid in the world by volume is the Great Pyramid of Cholula, in the east-central Mexican state of Puebla. The builders of certain classic Mesoamerican pyramids have decorated them copiously with stories about the Hero Twins, the feathered serpent Quetzalcoatl, Mesoamerican creation myths, ritualistic sacrifice, etc. written in the form of hieroglyphs on the rises of the steps of the pyramids, on the walls, and on the sculptures contained within. Aztecs Santa Cecilia Acatitlan pyramid The Aztecs, a people with a rich mythology and cultural heritage, dominated central Mexico in the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries. Their capital was Tenochtitlan on the shore of Lake Texcoco - the site of modern-day Mexico City. They were related to the preceding cultures in the basin of Mexico such as the culture of Teotihuacan whose building style they adopted and adapted. *El Tepozteco *Malinalco *Santa Cecilia Acatitlan *Templo Mayor *Tenayuca *Tenochtitlan Maya pyramids Edzna The Maya are a people of southern Mexico and northern Central America (Guatemala, Belize, western Honduras, and El Salvador) with some 3,000 years of history. Archaeological evidence shows the Maya started to build ceremonial architecture approximately 3,000 years ago. The earliest monuments consisted of simple burial mounds, the precursors to the spectacular stepped pyramids from the Terminal Pre-classic period and beyond. These pyramids relied on intricate carved stone in order to create a stair-stepped design. Many of these structures featured a top platform upon which a smaller dedicatory building was constructed, associated with a particular Maya deity. Maya pyramid-like structures were also erected to serve as a place of interment for powerful rulers. Maya pyramidal structures occur in a great variety of forms and functions, bounded by regional and periodical differences. Pur√©pechans The Tarascan state was a precolumbian culture located in the modern day Mexican state of Michoac√°n. The region is currently inhabited by the modern descendants of the Pur√©pecha. Pur√©pechan architecture is noted for \\"T\\"-shaped step pyramids known as y√°catas. *Tzintzuntzan Teotihuacan Pyramid of the Sun The Teotihuacan civilization, which flourished from around 300 BCE to 500 CE, at its greatest extent included most of Mesoamerica. Teotihuacano culture collapsed around 550 and was followed by several large city-states such as Xochicalco (whose inhabitants were probably of Matlatzinca ethnicity), Cholula (whose inhabitants were probably Oto- Manguean), and later the ceremonial site of Tula (which has traditionally been claimed to have been built by Toltecs but which now is thought to have been founded by the Huastec culture). *El Castillo & High Priest's Temple in Chichen Itza *Pyramids of the Sun, the Moon and Temple of the Feathered Serpent in Teotihuacan *Xochicalco * Talud-tablero  Toltec  El Taj√≠n The site called Tula, the Toltec capitol, in the state of Mexico is one of the best preserved five-tier pyramids in Mesoamerican civilization. The ground plan of the site has two pyramids, Pyramid B and Pyramid C. The Toltec empire lasted from around 700 to 1100. Although the origin of the Toltec Empire is a mystery, they are said to have migrated Mexico's northern plateau until they set up their empire‚Äôs capital in central Mexico, called Tula, which is 70 km/40 mi northwest of modern day Mexico City. When the city of Tula was in its prime it had around 40,000 people living in it and the city flourished from 900 to 1100. The city of Tula had a main plaza surrounded by 2 pyramids and a ritual ball court. The most popular pyramid on this site (pyramid b) is the pyramid of Quetzalcoatl which is a five-tiered pyramid with four giant carved pillars on top. The pyramid of Quetzalcoatl was named after a story of a legendary priest, also named Quetzalcoatl who was exiled from Tula around the year 1000. He is said to have ended warfare between Mayan city states and after that the Toltecs started worshiping Quetzalcoatl. Classic Veracruz The best known Classic Veracruz pyramid, the Pyramid of Niches in El Taj√≠n, is smaller than those of their neighbours and successors but more intricate. *El Taj√≠n Zapotecs The Zapotecs were one of the earliest Mesoamerican cultures and held sway over the Valley of Oaxaca region from the early first millennium BCE to about the 14th century. *Monte Alb√°n *Mitla Others The following sites are from northern Mesoamerica, built by cultures whose ethnic affiliations are unknown: =Altavista= Votive Pyramid at La Quemada This astronomical and also ceremonial center was the product of the Chalchihuite culture. Its occupation and development had a period of approximately 800 years (ca. 200--1000). This zone is considered an important archaeological center because of the astonishing, accurate functions of the edifications. The ones that stand out the most are: The Moon Plaza, The Votive Pyramid, the Ladder of Gamio and The labyrinth. In The Labyrinth you can appreciate with precision and accuracy, the respective equinoxes and the seasons. La Quemada A great quantity of buildings were constructed on artificial terraces upon the slopes of a hill. The materials used here include stone slab and clay. The most important structures are: The Hall of Columns, The Ball Court, The Votive Pyramid, and The Palace and the Barracks. On the most elevated part of the hill is The Fortress. This is composed of a small pyramid and a platform, encircled by a wall that is more than 800m long and up to six feet high. La Quemada was occupied from 800 to 1200. Their founders and occupants have not been identified with certainty but probably belonged to either the Chalchihuites culture or that of the neighbouring Malpaso culture.Kelly 2001, pp30-2.

It has been said that these teachings will have a long-lasting influence on the Church. Pope John Paul II's philosophical and theological teachings and writings were characterised by explorations in phenomenology and personalism.Hans K√∂chler, \\"The Phenomenology of Karol Wojtyla. On the Problem of the Phenomenological Foundation of Anthropology,\\" in: Philosophy and Phenomenological Research, Vol. 42 (1982), pp. 326-334. He was influenced by Hans Urs von Balthasar, Henri de Lubac, Yves Congar, Karl Rahner, his predecessors as Archbishop of Krak√≥w Eugeniusz Baziak and Adam Stefan Sapieha, and his predecessors as Pope - John XXIII, Paul VI, and John Paul I. His closest theological adviser was Cardinal Ratzinger, who succeeded him as Pope. Stanislaw Dziwisz was his personal secretary for forty years and one of his closest friends and advisers, and became Archbishop of Krak√≥w, John Paul's former post, and Cardinal. John Paul met regularly with the Cardinal prefects and presidents of Curial congregations and councils, and outlived many of them. Catechism of the Catholic Church John Paul II published the Catechism of the Catholic Church, which became an international best-seller . Its purpose, according to the Pope's Apostolic Constitution Fidei Depositum was to be \\"a statement of the Church's faith and of Catholic doctrine, attested to or illumined by Sacred Scripture, the Apostolic Tradition and the Church's Magisterium.\\" He declared \\"it to be a sure norm for teaching the faith\\" to \\"serve the renewal\\" of the Church. Holiness and morality Right after being elected as Pope, he told the cardinals who elected him that he saw that his main work was to implement the teachings of the Second Vatican Council, an important centrepiece of which is a universal call to holiness. This is the basis for his canonization of saints from all walks of life, as well as for establishing and supporting the personal prelature of Opus Dei, that teaches that everyone is called to holiness and that ordinary life is a path to sanctity. His first encyclical letters focused on the Triune God; the very first was on Jesus the Redeemer (\\"Redemptor hominis\\"). He maintained this intellectual focus on God throughout his pontificate. In The Splendor of Truth (\\"Veritatis Splendor\\"), a papal encyclical concerning morality, he emphasised the dependence of man on God and his law (\\"Without the Creator, the creature disappears\\") and the \\"dependence of freedom on the truth.\\" He said that man \\"giving himself over to relativism and scepticism, goes off in search of an illusory freedom apart from truth itself.\\" Master plan for the new millennium In his master plan for the new millennium, the Apostolic Letter At the beginning of the third millennium, (\\"Novo Millennio Ineunte\\") a \\"program for all times\\", he emphasised the importance of \\"starting afresh from Christ\\": \\"No, we shall not be saved by a formula but by a Person.\\" Thus, the first priority for the Church is holiness: \\"All Christian faithful...are called to the fullness of the Christian life.\\" Christians, he writes, contradict this when they \\"settle for a life of mediocrity, marked by a minimalist ethic and a shallow religiosity.\\" He highlighted \\"the radical message of the gospels,\\" whose demands should not be watered down. The \\"training in holiness calls for a Christian life distinguished above all in the art of prayer.\\" His last Encyclical is on the Holy Eucharist, which he says \\"contains the Church's entire spiritual wealth: Christ himself.\\" Building on his master plan further, he emphasised the need to \\"rekindle amazement\\" on the Eucharist and to \\"contemplate the face of Christ.\\" Mariology Coat of Arms of Pope John Paul II. The letter M in the Marian Cross is for Mary, Jesus' mother. John Paul II's strong Marian devotion was highly influenced by the Mariology of Saint Louis de Montfort. According to his Apostolic Letter Rosarium Virginis Mariae, the pontif's personal motto \\"Totus Tuus\\" was inspired by St. Louis' doctrine on total consecration to the Virgin Mary, which he quoted: :‚ÄúOur entire perfection consists in being conformed, united and consecrated to Jesus Christ. Hence the most perfect of all devotions is undoubtedly that which conforms, unites and consecrates us most perfectly to Jesus Christ. :Now, since Mary is of all creatures the one most conformed to Jesus Christ, it follows that among all devotions that which most consecrates and conforms a soul to our Lord is devotion to Mary, his Holy Mother, and that the more a soul is consecrated to her the more will it be consecrated to Jesus Christ.\\"Pope John Paul II's Apostolic Letter Rosarium Virginis Mariae https://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul- ii/en/apost_letters/2002/documents/hf_jp-ii_apl_20021016_rosarium-virginis- mariae.html In an address to the Montfortian Fathers, the pontiff also said that his reading Saint Louis de Montfort's work The True Devotion to Mary was a \\"decisive turning point\\" in his life.Pope John Paul II on de Montfort On September 19, 1996, Pope John-Paul II made a papal trip to Saint-Laurent-sur- S√®vre to meditate and pray on the adjacent tombs of Saint Louis de Montfort and Blessed Marie Louise Trichet, whom he beatified himself. His encyclical Redemptoris Mater further emphasizes his focus on Mariology.Pope John Paul II's encyclical Redemptoris Mater http://www.cin.org/jp2ency/jp2mot.html Social and family doctrine John Paul II also wrote extensively about workers and the social doctrine of the Church, which he discussed in three encyclicals and which the Vatican brought to the fore through the recently published Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church. Through his encyclicals, John Paul also talked about the dignity of women and the importance of the family for the future of humanity. Other important documents include the encyclicals The Gospel of Life (\\"Evangelium Vitae\\") and Faith and Reason (\\"Fides et Ratio\\"), and the Apostolic Letter \\"Light of the East\\" (Orientale Lumen). John Paul II reaffirmed the Church's clear opposition to contraception, abortion and homosexual activity. His book Memory and Identity said that the push for same-sex marriage might be part of a \\"new ideology of evil... which attempts to pit human rights against the family and against man.\\" He refined some of these positions in their theological context in his Theology of the Body lectures. John Paul II, who was present and very influential at the 1962‚Äì65 Second Vatican Council, affirmed the teachings of the Council and did much to implement them. John Paul II continued to declare that contraception, abortion, and homosexual acts were gravely sinful, and, with Joseph Ratzinger (future Pope Benedict XVI), opposed Liberation theology. John Paul II's statue in Ko≈°ice, Slovakia. The statue was unveiled by Cardinal Stanis≈Çaw Dziwisz, who had been Pope John Paul II private secretary. Monument to Pope John Paul II in Pozna≈Ñ He believed in the Church's exaltation of the marital act of sexual intercourse between a baptised man and woman within sacramental marriage as proper and exclusive to the sacrament of marriage that was, in every instance, profaned by contraception, abortion, divorce followed by a further marriage, and by homosexual acts. He explained and asserted in 1994 the Church's lack of authority to ordain women to the priesthood. This was deemed a repudiation of calls to ordain women to the priesthood. (Apostolic Letter 'Ordinatio Sacerdotalis') In addition John Paul II did not end the discipline of mandatory priestly celibacy, although he allowed a few married clergymen of other Christian traditions who later became Catholic to be ordained as Catholic priests. John Paul II, as a writer of philosophical and theological thought, was characterized by his explorations in phenomenology and personalism. He is also known for his development of the Theology of the Body.

It is a shape-changing spirit that typically takes the form of an attractive, long haired woman seen from behind. She lures men away into danger before revealing her face to be that of a horse or, alternatively, a skull. The Siguanaba and its variants may have been brought to Latin America from Spain during the Colonial Period, used by the colonists as a means of exercising control over the indigenous and mestizo population.Fern√°ndez-Poncela 1995, p.107. Appearance When encountered, she is a beautiful woman who is either naked or dressed in flimsy white; she usually appears bathing in a public water tank, river, or other water source,Lara Figueroa 1996, pp.28-29. although she may also be found washing clothing.Lara Figueroa 1996, p.32. She likes to lure lone men out late on dark, moonless nights, without letting them see her face at first.Lara Figueroa 1996, p.29. She tempts such men away from their planned routes to lose them in deep canyons. In Guatemala, the Siguanaba appears as a beautiful, seductive woman with very long hair. She will not reveal her face until the last moment, when it is revealed as either the face of a horse or, alternatively, a human skull.Lara Figueroa 1996, p.30. If her victim (usually an unfaithful man) does not die of fear, then he is driven mad by the sight.Barnoya G√°lvez 1999, p.139. From afar, the Siguanaba can imitate the appearance of a man's girlfriend in order to lead him astray. When appearing to children, the Siguanaba will take on the appearance of the child's mother in order to lure her victim into her grasp; once touched by the Siguanaba the child is driven mad and she will lead her victim into the wilderness to leave the child lost and insane.Molina et al 2006, p.31. Defence Traditional methods are said to ward off the Siguanaba. In the border regions between Guatemala and El Salvador, those who see the Siguanaba make the sign of the cross upon her or bite their machete, while simultaneously banishing both the evil spirit and the fear that grips the victim. Etymology The word siguanaba or sihuanaba has its origin in the indigenous languages of Mesoamerica. Various words have been suggested as its source. In parts of Mexico the Siguanaba is known as macihuatli, a Nahuatl word that can be broken down to two elements; cihuatl (meaning \\"woman\\") and matlatl (meaning \\"net\\"). This \\"net-woman\\" encompasses the figurative idea of a woman capturing men in her metaphorical net of attraction.Lara Figueroa 1996, pp.38-39. Likewise, cigua or cegua, names for the spirit in Honduras and Costa Rica, also have their origin in the Nahuatl word cihuatl, simply meaning \\"woman\\". Guatemalan historian and folklorist Adri√°n Recinos gave two possible origins for the word siguanaba. In one of the 20+ languages of Guatemala, he claimed ciguanaba meant \\"naked woman\\" but he failed to identify the exact language of origin. In another source he claimed that its origin is the Nahuatl ciuanauac or ciguanauac, meaning \\"concubine\\". In Guatemala, the word siguanaba has been linked to siwan, a K'iche' Maya word meaning a cliff or deep ravine, and Guatemalan folk etymology gives this as the origin of the word, although scholars such as Recinos and Roberto Paz y Paz disagree.Christenson. Regional variations right In Guatemala the Sihuanaba is known as La Siguanaba; she is known as Cigua in Honduras, Ciguanaba in El Salvador and as Cegua in Costa Rica. Although the name varies from place to place, the appearance and actions of the Sihuanaba remain unchanged.Lara Figuaroa 1996, p.33. =Spain= In other latitudes and cultures, not connected to each other, the theme also appears. For example, an original variant is found in Spain. The washerwomen, especially in the province of Asturias, constitute a kind of supernatural beings, \\"ghosts that almost always lead to death.\\" They are fuzzy beings who wash clothes on the banks of rivers on moonless nights. The specter of the Wagtail is often described as an old woman with white hair and dressed in black. There are also versions in which it is said that she acquires the form of a beautiful woman before men, but when men approach her, she turns into a monster and then kills them. =El Salvador= The Salvadoran legend of La Siguanaba says that the woman, originally called Sihuehuet (beautiful woman), was a peasant girl that ascended to queen using her charms (and a witch's brew) to lure into marriage Tlaloc's son, Yeisun, who was a Nahuatl prince. After marriage, when her husband went to war, she had affairs with other men, and Cipitio was the child of this relationship. Sihuehuet was a bad mother, neglecting her son, leaving him alone to meet her lovers. To inherit the throne she concocted a plot to use another magic potion to poison Yeisun during a festival, and so claim the throne for her lover. But the plan worked too well. Yeisun was transformed into a savage giant monster with two heads, who ravaged the attendants to the palace's feast. The guard struggled and defeated the creature, ending Yeisun's life. When Tlaloc found out about this, he sought the help of the almighty god, Teotl whom condemned and cursed Sihuehuet: She would be called Sihuanaba (\\"hideous woman\\"); she would be beautiful at first sight, but she would turn into a horrible abomination after luring her victims to isolated gorges. She was forced to wander the countryside, appearing to men who travelled alone at night. She is supposed to be seen at night in the rivers of El Salvador, washing clothes and always looking for her son, Cipitio, who was also cursed by Teotl to remain a boy for eternity. =Guatemala= In Guatemala, the Siguanaba is said to be encountered washing her hair with a golden bowl and combing her hair with a golden comb. She is said to wander the streets of Guatemala City, luring away men who are in love.Lara Figueroa 2001, p.37. In Guatemala, the legend is more common in Guatemala City, Antigua Guatemala (the old colonial capital) and the eastern departments of the country.Lara Figueroa 1996, p.31. The most common variant in these areas is that where the spirit has the face of a horse. In Guatemala the Siguanaba is often said to appear to men who are unfaithful in order to punish them. A Kaqchikel Maya version of the Siguanaba from San Juan Comalapa describes her as a woman with enormous glowing eyes and a hoof for a hand. She wears a glittering dress and has very long hair and haunts the local rubbish dump, frightening disobedient children and drunken husbands.Staikidis 2006, pp.49, 58. On the Guatemalan side of Lake G√ºija, in Jutiapa Department, the Siguanaba is able to take on many forms but the most common is that of a slim, beautiful woman with long hair who bathes herself on the banks of the Ost√∫a River, although she may also appear by other water sources or simply by lonely roadsides.Molina et al 2006, p.30. To lustful men she appears just as a beautiful woman, while to lovestruck men she takes the form of the object of the man's affections. A tale from San Juan La Isla relates how a man went to meet his wife who was returning on horseback from El Salvador, and after accompanying her for a while his \\"wife\\" flung herself from her mount and revealed herself to be the Siguanaba. In this same region, the Siguanaba is said to appear on moonlit nights to horseriders on lonely roads, asking to ride pillion. After riding with her victim for a short while, she reveals her fingernails as fearsome claws and her face as that of a horse, causing the rider to die of terror. Those lucky few that manage to flee find themselves lost in the wilderness. =Mexico= In Mexico the legend of the Siguanaba is present in almost the entire country, mostly throughout Mesoamerica, where they call her Macihuatli, Matlazihua, X'tabay, X'tabal or, popularly, \\"Horse- faced woman\\"; and some even relate it to La Llorona. There are multiple testimonies and stories about this horror. They all have in common that they can only be seen at night on lonely roads or places, showing themselves as night owl men, partiers, womanizers or drunkards, or all of that at the same time. She shows herself as a woman with an attractive body, very well formed, always on her back or walking away, with her face completely covered by either her hair or a large veil ... Invariably, the victim feels fascinated and attracted to the beautiful woman, whom he decides to follow or approach, filling her with compliments and insinuations of all kinds, color and intention ... She always ignores and tries to hide her face even more, which always provokes the victim's insistence, until she turns the woman away, taking the fright of her life, since the woman has a horse's head and red eyes. Sometimes she utters phrases like \\"Do I still look beautiful to you?\\" or \\"I also like you a lot\\". The victim screams in terror and flees from there as fast as her legs allow, now without the effects of alcohol; and swearing never to drink again ... Although there are cases in which the victim is \\"touched\\" and dies shortly thereafter despite attempts by the family to \\"take him to clean\\" or \\"cure him of dread\\". As you can see, this appearance plays a sobering role that brings a consequence for a specific behavior, it is not like the famous weeping woman who causes terror to whoever has the misfortune to meet her or hear her famous scream, regardless of gender, age or any other characteristics. The Siguanaba, or the woman with the face of a horse, is an entity that is in charge of complying with it, or else, of the classic recommendations of the grandmother or the mother to the young men: \\"do not go out now and behave well.\\" It should be mentioned that sometimes her head varies, not only can it be that of a horse, but it can also be that of a dog, a pig, an old woman's face, a skull or a disfigured and bloody face. Likewise, the horse's head also varies, it can be that of a common horse, a horse skull, it can be putrefied, it can be a face with rotten meat or a horse face with skin. In the state of Nayarit, there is a version similar to the Salvadoran version. According to the Nayarit version, it was a woman or a moon goddess who was the wife of the god Tlaloc, with whom she had a son, who treated her badly, abandoned her and was unfaithful to her husband, who, after discovering his bad actions, He cursed her calling her Sihuanaba, which means 'horrible woman'; being condemned to wander the countryside, appearing to men as a beautiful woman and by the time they got close she would reveal a hideous horse face. He has always been seen more frequently on roads, rivers, fields, and elsewhere. Its victims are mainly infidels, whom it attracts to drive them crazy or kill them. In the state of Coahuila, within the city of Torre√≥n, this terrible specter that frightens men would actually be a woman who received a curse or was the victim of witchcraft, black magic or a satanic ritual, so it would be an evil or a demonic entity seeking \\"revenge\\". In preference, they appear to lustful, womanizing or night owls. Another version tells that it was a beautiful young woman who received a curse, turning her into this being; condemned to be with her woman's body and horse's head. The young woman would be normal, but when they approached her, her face would become that of a horse and everyone would run away from fright, so she would never find true love and be alone forever. In the state of Nuevo Le√≥n, they say that he is seen on the roads at night in search of punishing machistas, gangsters, womanizers, lustful or any man who goes astray to kill him. It is also said to cause accidents. In Mexico City, according to the Mexica, the Macihuatli was the deity of the moon called Metztli, who pains the betrayal of her husband Tl√°loc. Other versions indicate that she was a woman of lousy behavior, which is why she was cursed by her husband or her father-in-law to wander as a ghost hunting men. Today, in some versions, she is described as a woman with a skull similar to that of a horse and with legs of a horse, which is beautiful at first glance, but up close is a monstrous being. In colonial legends she frightened the night owl, the rapist or the woman who walked in bad steps taking them to ravines and then killing him. Inclusively, there is the story of a supposed encounter of Hern√°n Cort√©s with this creature. In the state of Puebla, it is known as the Andalona, where it is described as a spectrum that has multiple forms; he is said to seduce men who roam the mountains in order to drive them mad or kill them. Some say he dresses in white, has chicken feet and floats in the air. In the state of Guerrero, it is known as the Chaneca, where it is said to be the fruit of a relationship between a common woman and a chaneque. She was given the opportunity to get to know the outside world. Like her father, she was very much in love but the men rejected her. For that reason, she decides to take revenge on men by seducing them and then killing them. In Oaxaca, where he is known as the Matlazihua or Bandolera, he is associated with a \\"Zapotec\\" deity of death, formerly known as Mictecacihuatl. According to the old belief, this was the one that reigned and was in charge of collecting the souls of the deceased to take them to the underworld and was the husband of Mictlantecuhtli, the lord of the dead. It is also believed to be the soul in pain of a woman who was cruel and murderous, and wanders in this world by way of punishment. This specter is said to punish people's wrongdoings, or sins, but it generally appears to men (who would be drunkards, womanizers, partygoers, or those who abandon their families). She appears to them as a beautiful woman -of mixed race-, who draws them towards a ravine and when they approach her she reveals her horse face (or human skull, according to other versions; although also most of the time she is never seen face), which causes the man to fall into the ravine - leading them to suicide - and into the thorns so that they can bleed to death, although there are times when the victim survives, waking up in the thorns, in pain and without remembering anything that happened. other versions that say that the Matlazihua bathes or combs in the rivers of Oaxaca and whoever invades their space or takes their comb suffers the consequences. In other versions, like the Guatemalan and Nicaraguan versions, it is stated that she is not a single being, but that there are several that even cooperate with each other to scare her victim, communicate with each other with whistles and leave the men stunned. In the state of Durango it is better known as the Caballona, where it also appears to men with sinful behavior. Here it devours or warns them. In the state of Jalisco, she is generally described as a woman dressed entirely in black, and she also appears to lovers and drunkards. In the state of Aguascalientes, especially in the city of Calvillo, it is believed that the horse-faced woman was a beautiful woman who was unfaithful to him with many suitors (or with her lover, according to other versions). But, one day, the husband discovered her doing one of her infidelities with her lover, who, in an incredible state of jealousy, killed her lover. In the meantime, he tied his hands with a rope and, holding her by the horse, he made a swift run. This caused the poor woman to be seriously injured and her face was disfigured, which looked like a horse. The injuries were so severe that he ended up dying. Since then, it is said that, at night, an attractive woman can be seen walking who seduces men with bad behavior (especially unfaithful men), as punishment; to later reveal that he has a horse's face. In the town square, there is a monument of the Horse Face Woman, of which many of the inhabitants do not know the legend and its origin. In the southeast of the republic they call it the Xtabay or Xtabal, which is, according to Mayan legend, an evil spirit that lives in ceiba trees and seduces anyone who comes near some of these trees. This was a Mayan goddess, dominated as √çxtab, who was the goddess of the hanged, the latter rewarded suicides with heaven but, with the arrival of Christianity, she is now the punisher of those already mentioned and a demon woman who scares the men. A second version tells that it was a Mayan princess named Suluay, daughter of Governor Halach Huinic, who had fallen in love with a young warrior and they saw each other in a ceiba tree. And that it was sent by the granddaughter of a witch, who spell it killing her immediately. Then they left the body in the bush. Although there are other versions that say that warrior was an assistant to the witch to help her kill Suluay. Well, whatever the origin of the Xtabay, it is said that it is a woman who appears in the ceibo trees, combing her long black hair, waiting for a man to approach her and start seducing them, to later reveal her true identity: demonic-looking and face with horse features (disfigured face or a pale woman's face with yellow eyes and snake tongue, according to other versions). Sometimes he lets them go, which drives them crazy or, at other times, they die of fright. Sometimes, she is seen as a punisher for drunks, womanizers and infidels, whom she chooses because they are easier to deceive and catch. An important version is the concan version (from the town of Conc√°) of Quer√©taro of the Siguanaba, where it is said that it appears in a lake, under a bridge, which is known as the \\"Puente del Sapo\\", there it is He says that the Siguanaba appears as a beautiful woman who bathes naked to attract men, and always turns her back. The men approaching start talking while trying to see his face, many despair after waiting for a while to see his face; reason why many pull it, showing that, that woman who was supposed to have a beautiful face, has a horse's head that smiles at them maliciously, for which many flee. And the demonic spirit stays to continue its \\"ritual of conquest\\". Many, at night, fear and avoid passing by so that the horrifying appearance comes out and fear that the legend is true. Finally, there is the Chiapas version (from the state of Chiapas). In this last version, it is known as the N√∂wayomo, Tisigua or Tishanila. In some regions or places it is considered as an evil spirit and in others as a benign spirit. It is said that she is the wife of the Sombrer√≥n. It is said that it appears to men who are unfaithful, bathes in any lake and when they approach it she reveals a demonized horse face (or a disfigured face according to the best known versions) that kills them or lets them go. Many of the unfortunate ones who have seen it change forever. Many of their relatives notice that they no longer eat and see that, in a corner or anywhere, they are seen sitting or standing waiting for the Tisigua or Tishanila. In other regions of Chiapas, it is also said that the Siguanaba may appear on the roads asking motorcyclists to climb it and, after a while of walking, it transforms into a monster with the head of a horse. In other regions it is known like the Yegualc√≠huatl who, like the Mayan and Oaxacan version, bewitches men with her beautiful body, she always leads them to a ravine and then begins to throw them off the cliff by causing them to fall down the ravine - leading them to suicide -. It is said that they see that the woman, instead of walking, is floating through the air, but they do not give so much importance to wanting to reach her. In addition, some also sign that she is accompanied by the Cadejo and together they are in charge of punishing by scaring men of bad life. =Honduras= In Honduras it is known as \\"La Sucia\\" or Cigua. The popular story of a beautiful young woman denied marriage at the altar because she was unbaptized. She then wandered out of mind, never removing her increasingly filthy wedding dress until she died of heartbreak after her suitor married another. The story follows that she appears in beautiful form to lure men roaming drunk by rivers and streams, so enraptured by her beauty they follow her until she changes into a filthy horror that drives men crazy.The Sihuanaba in Honduras =Costa Rica= In Costa Rica, this spectrum is known by the name of Cegua, a spectrum (colloquially, fright) that is characterized because its face is that of a dead horse in a state of decomposition. In this country, La Cegua is a myth that is present more than anything else in rural areas, although its actions are eminently the same as in the rest of Mexico and Central America (especially in relation to its habit of bathing at night), La Cegua has the peculiarity that sometimes it also appears among herds of horses, mounted on one of these, which causes panic. Other popular versions say that the Cegua appears on the roads as a beautiful woman before the womanizers or drunkards, who are asked to take her to her horse (car or motorcycle, according to the most modern versions). She is described as a very pretty young woman, white (or brunette, depending on the version), with an oval face, large black eyes, long curly black hair and a beautiful mouth, with lips red as blood, with a divine voice that lulls like siren song, and body with pronounced curves, slender and tempting. She is dressed in full black or white, and on some occasions, in a vaporous pink dress, and in other versions, with a luxurious period dress. Legend has it that no man can resist such a beautiful body and sweet plea, which makes them climb it. Once climbing the woman, after a while of calbalgar, it transforms into a monster with a head similar to that of a horse. La Cegua also appears to those womanizing men who walk late at night on the street, she appears to them and with her sweetness makes him believe that it is a new conquest but at one point shows his horse face. Another important version is that the Cegua can also appear in the form of a child who cries inconsolably on the side of the road or near a river, and when the rider picks him up and puts him on the horse to calm him, he transforms into the monster with horse face. Regarding the origin of the character in the Costa Rican territory, it is believed or believed that La Cegua was a young libertine who had been cursed by her mother when the girl had tried to hit her, as she was denied permission to go to a party. Still others also affirm that it is a demonic manifestation, like that of the Devil. In the province of Guanacaste, also in Costa Rica, La Cegua, in addition to appearing to men on the roads, could also appear at dances and festivals in the towns, where he flirts with every man who approaches him. The one who manages to conquer her, accompanies her to the clearing of the Guanacaste pampa, and under a leafy Guanacaste tree, surrender to her love affairs, until late at night, when the man finally tries to kiss her, the metamorphosis occurs. = Nicaragua = In Nicaragua, it is also known as the Cegua (or also Ceguanaba or Ceguanagua). In this country, Cegua is also more present in rural areas and its actions are the same as in other countries; It is said that she is a witch who was betrayed by her partner and that she is looking for revenge against the womanizing men and night owls, for which she would make a pact with the devil in a cornfield, where she would make a ritual to vomit her soul and begin his transformation, first transforming his face into that of a skeletal mare. Following that, the rest of her body transforms: her legs become as long and robust as a horse's hind legs, her feet get bigger, and the same goes for her arms, giving her great physical strength and speed, which will ensure you do not let your victim escape. Thus, with this transformation, the Cegua would walk through the fields in search of womanizers and night owls to punish them. When the rider or night owl is not cautious, the Cegua would ambush him first, playing with him, then tormenting him but not killing him immediately. The specter seizes the man and bites his cheek to mark him as an adulterer, leaving him crazy and scared to death. Of those who were left alive, they remain in a state of idiocy. From there, the Nicaraguan popular saying derives: \\"It is played by Cegua.\\" There are also stories that the Cegua is not just one, but several ceguas that can even cooperate to catch their victim. Other versions include Mesoamerican horror as a beautiful girl who, when the man approaches, turns into a horrendous old woman. There is also another version of the legend, located in the department of Le√≥n, which describes her as an ugly and old woman, long white hair, with her breasts up to her stomach and who laughs mockingly. When she has her victim, who are men and boys, trapped, she offers him one of her breasts; It terrifies her until it drives her crazy. And still today, it is said that the Cegua also appears in the trees of Guanascaste, where a womanizer or late- night waiter awaits under a beautiful veil. When the man approaches, she lifts her veil, showing a horrible skull face in a decomposed state. =Panama= In Panama, this entity is known as the Empollerada Woman. As in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, it is said to punish drunk and womanizing men who travel by transport. She is described as a woman of great beauty who is very brooding, and very well groomed; hence its name. Upon seeing her, she would convince the man to put her on his horse (or car, according to the most modern accounts). The man, then, when turning to look lasciviously at the young woman, finds that he has mounted his horse on a spectrum that, where he previously had the head of a woman, now presents himself with the face of a human skull (or, in the most versions, such as a hatched skeleton). Thus scaring the man who is upset with fear before that terrifying specter. The origin of the ghost tells that it was a woman who committed suicide because her boyfriend or lover was unfaithful to her and, therefore, her spirit wanders in search of revenge, punishing womanizers and drunkards as her partner was.

Sheikh Badr (, ) was a Palestinian Arab village on a hilltop in west Jerusalem. It was depopulated during the 1947‚Äì1948 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine on the order of the Haganah.Morris, 2004, p. 121 From 1948 to 1951, a temporary Jewish cemetery was established here; a few hundred graves still remain from that time. After 1949, the area was incorporated into a new area called Givat Ram. Location Sheikh Badr was on a hilltop south of Jaffa Road, extending from the present-day Hebrew University of Jerusalem at Givat Ram to the Jerusalem International Convention Center (Binyanei HaUma). Its western flank was bordered to the north by the Jewish neighborhood of Romema,Khalidi, 1992, p. 303 founded in 1921, placing it close to the entrance to the city of Jerusalem. The site is now occupied by the International Convention Center and the Crowne Plaza Hotel. History An Ottoman village list of about 1870 described Schech Bedr as a Muslim Wali in Jerusalem, with ruins from earlier settlements.Socin, 1879, p. 160 During the British Mandate for Palestine, Sheikh Badr was a semi-rural Arab village in western Jerusalem which benefited from its proximity to the major Jewish neighborhoods and thus increased employment opportunities. The villagers grew wheat in what is now Sacher Park.Alcalay, Ammiel. \\"I Had Thought of Writing a Book Based on the Following Facts\\", in Sephardic-American Voices: Two hundred years of a literary legacy, Diane Matza, ed. 1998: UPNE, p. 291. . =Depopulation= The final months of the British Mandate saw the British turn a blind eye to Arab attacks on Jewish areas. During the 1947‚Äì1948 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine, the Haganah set in motion a plan to occupy (and if met with resistance, evacuate) Arab villages in order to protect nearby Jewish communities and to strengthen the Jewish hold on these sites. Sheikh Badr and Lifta were the first Arab villages to undergo mass evacuation. To create a \\"general air of insecurity\\" that would speed up the process, the Lehi blew up the home of the village mukhtar, Haj Suleiman Hamini, on January 11, 1948.Krystall, Nathan \\"The Fall of the New City 1947-1950\\" in Jerusalem 1948: The Arab Neighbourhoods and their Fate in the War, Salim Tamari, ed. Jerusalem: Institute for Jerusalem Studies and Badil Resource Center, 1999. Retrieved 23 October 2012. Two days later Haganah launched another raid on Sheikh Badr, damaging 20 houses. The Arab residents evacuated Sheikh Badr between January 14 and 19, after which British policemen came in to guard the vacated homes. However, Jews from the neighborhood of Nahlaot made several raids on the deserted village, destroying and setting fire to remaining property. =Jewish cemetery= Sheikh Badr Cemetery. Until 1948, Jewish burials in Jerusalem were conducted in the centuries-old Jewish cemetery on the Mount of Olives. In January 1948, the Arab siege of Jerusalem made the Mount of Olives inaccessible, as the route to the cemetery passed through hostile Arab villages. (subscription required) After war broke out in May 1948, two temporary burial grounds were opened in central Jerusalem - one in Sheikh Badr and the other on the grounds of the first Shaare Zedek Hospital. The Sheikh Badr cemetery functioned as a temporary burial ground from its opening on May 31, 1948 through late 1950. Unlike regular Jewish burials in Israel in which the deceased is placed directly into the grave, the deceased in Sheikh Badr were placed in wooden caskets above-ground to expedite their removal once the war ended. An adjoining quarry was also used for burials; here, bodies were buried in three layers, one atop the other, with a layer of dirt between each one. In late 1950, approximately 300 soldiers buried in the cemetery were reinterred on Mount Herzl, and 600 civilians were reinterred on Har HaMenuchot.Rossoff, Dovid (2005), pp. 389-390. In mid-1955, the decision was made to bury the remaining bodies in the Sheikh Badr cemetery in earth and to erect a headstone over each grave. =Givat Ram= View of former area of Sheikh Badr, now Sacher Park. The Israel Supreme Court building is at right. In 1949 Sheikh Badr was incorporated into a larger area renamed Givat Ram. Archeological findings Archaeological excavations indicate that the area of Sheikh Badr was inhabited from Iron Age II to the Byzantine period (late 8th century BCE to early 7th century CE). It appears to have been \\"strategically located at the top of the ascent from the coastal plain (or descent for those leaving the Old City of Jerusalem)\\". Digs were carried out in 1949, 1968 and 1992‚Äì1993.

It was built to service the growing town of Waukegan, the Great Lakes Naval Training Center, and the northern suburban sprawl of Chicago. After several years of decline, Lakehurst closed in 2001, and was demolished in 2004.  Beginning  In December 1968, of farmland close to the busy Tri-State Tollway was purchased from Thomas E. Wilson/Edellyn Farms for $2 million, and annexed into Waukegan, Illinois. Construction on the mall began about one year later, in September 1969. A five-year research project of Lake County had concluded that Lake County would be one of the fastest developing areas of the Midwest. The mixed- use (commercial/office/residential) development including Lakehurst Mall was built to service this new population. The mall was designed by Sidney H. Morris and Associates of Chicago and Gruen Associates of Los Angeles; Gruen was a well-known name in mall construction, dating from their pioneering 1956 design of Southdale Center in Edina, Minnesota. Initially, Arthur Rubloff & Co. of Chicago was the management and leasing agent for Lakehurst. The new 1.1 million square feet (102,000 m¬≤) mall was substantially larger than other malls in the area. There were three major department stores and about 100 smaller stores. A convenience center, which included the Chicago-native grocery store Jewel-Osco, was added to the original plan, as were over 6,000 parking spaces.  1970s  The mall officially opened on August 19, 1971. Over 5,000 people attended the opening day ceremonies, including the mayor of Waukegan. Carson Pirie Scott & co. Outparcels of the mall site were developed into the General Cinema Lakehurst 12 movie theatre (which opened in 1974) and restaurants such as Red Lobster. An apartment complex with over 200 rental units was completed by the mid-1970s.  1980s  A Marriott hotel was added to the area, and Pier 1 Imports and Service Merchandise were built on outparcels. Jacobs, Visconsi, and Jacobs, of Cleveland, Ohio bought the general areas of the mall and the convenience center from Arthur Rubloff in October 1982. (The anchor properties were owned by their respective department stores.) The JCPenney Auto Shop closed in 1983 as part of a national decision by JCPenney to leave the auto repair business. The Globe Company, a local Lake County company, founded in 1898, went bankrupt and closed in 1985. In August 1986, the Wieboldt's anchor went out of business, prior to the eventual closure of the entire chain. Wieboldt's management blamed the closure on the extensive distance between this store and their Chicago distribution hub, which incurred substantial expenses. The company sold their location to the Jacobs Group. The location being vacant came as a blessing when 1986 brought floods to Gurnee, Illinois, severely damaging two of the city's three elementary schools. Students in kindergarten through fourth grade were housed in the sole undamaged elementary school, while more than 600 fifth through eighth grade students were housed in the old Wieboldt's space. The space was informally known as \\"Wieboldt U\\" during that time, and the former store's shelving units were used for school storage. After the school was renovated and the \\"Wieboldt U\\" students left, Dunham's Sports became an anchor on the lower level; several months later, Montgomery Ward moved into the upper level and built a new auto service center on an outparcel. The Montgomery Ward store had previously been located in the Belvidere Mall a few miles down Route 120. With the major anchor at Belvidere Mall gone, most thought that Belvidere Mall would close soon. It turned out that Lakehurst would close before Belvidere.  1990s  On August 8, 1991, Gurnee Mills opened seven miles (11 km) away from Lakehurst. The newer, larger Gurnee Mills proved a much larger draw than expected, devastating Lakehurst's retail base. The mall had 100 tenants at the beginning of the 1990s, but by 1997, about fifty businesses remained. In early 1998, both Montgomery Ward and JCPenney pulled out of Lakehurst, leaving Carson Pirie Scott as the sole anchor. The Jacobs Group sold Lakehurst in the summer of 1998; the price was $30 million, a little less than that of the sale price in 1982.  2000s  Fewer than five tenants remained by 2000. These included the Gift Tree and Barbary Coast stores in the mall, as well as the Carson Pirie Scott anchor. When the leases on the two mall stores ended on January 31, 2001, most of the mall was shuttered, and only Carson's was in operation. During the mall's final days, a portion of the film \\"'77\\" was filmed inside the former KB Toys building. = Demolition = Demolition of Wieboldt's section of Lakehurst in 2004 Ownership changed from the Jacobs Group to the Shaw Company of Oak Brook, Illinois. A phased demolition began near the JCPenney store in November 2003. Carson's stayed open for the Christmas season and closed on January 15, 2004. Demolition of the JCPenney section was completed February 2004, followed by the Wieboldt's/Montgomery Ward section, then the Carson's section, and ended with the gazebo of the Wieboldts anchor, which had outlasted the anchor. A Walmart supercenter was built on the northern part of the property, while the southern portion remains largely undeveloped. Part of the street encircling the property still retains the name \\"Lakehurst Road\\".

The 58-year-old was extremely healthy and active for his age, jogging in the Vatican gardens to the horror of Vatican staff, who informed him that his jogging could be seen by tourists climbing to the summit of the dome of St. Peter's Basilica. The pope's response, according to media reports, was \\"so what?\\" When the cost of installing a swimming pool in his summer residence was queried by cardinals, John Paul joked that it was \\"cheaper than another conclave\\". John Paul's obvious physical fitness and looks earned much comment in the media following his election, which compared his health and trim figure to the poor health of John Paul I and Paul VI, the portliness of Pope John XXIII and the constant claims of ailments of Pius XII. The only modern pope with a keep-fit regime had been Pope Pius XI (r: 1922-1939) who was an avid mountain climber. An Irish Independent article in the 1980s labelled John Paul \\"the keep-fit pope\\". However, after over twenty-five years on the papal throne, two assassination attempts (one of which resulted in severe physical injury to the Pope), and a number of cancer scares, John Paul's physical health declined. 1981 assassination attempt The 1981 assassination attempt was costlier to his overall health than was generally known by the public at the time. Rushed to the Agostino Gemelli University Polyclinic to undergo emergency surgery, he experienced profound bleeding leading to a dangerous fall in blood pressure and to cardiac arrest, which was however successfully defibrillated. He received the Anointing of the Sick (formerly known as \\"Last Rites\\"). Despite difficulties with extensive blood transfusions, which are speculated to have transmitted cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, surgery was eventually successful. The bullet had passed completely through the body, puncturing the intestines and necessitating a colostomy. Seven weeks later, discussions were held about reversing the colostomy and eight of nine doctors voted against it, arguing the Pope was still too weak from the CMV infection. Saying \\"I don't want to continue half dead and half alive\\", the Pope effectively overruled his physicians and the reversal was done successfully on August 5, 1981. Later years Despite the shooting and the complications during recovery, John Paul remained in good physical condition throughout the 1980s, and remained active as well. During the 1990s John Paul's health began to decline. A benign intestinal tumor was removed in 1992; he experienced two falls in 1993 and 1994 which dislocated his shoulder and broke his femur respectively; and he underwent an appendectomy in 1996. In December 1995, he had to suspend his urbi et orbi blessing on Christmas Day after a dizzy spell. An orthopaedic surgeon confirmed in 2001 that Pope John Paul II was suffering from Parkinson's disease, as international observers had suspected for some time; this was acknowledged publicly by the Vatican in 2003. Despite difficulty speaking more than a few sentences at a time, trouble hearing and severe osteoarthrosis, he continued to tour the world, although rarely walking in public. Some of those who met him late in his life said that although physically he was in poor shape, mentally he remained fully alert. However, that claim was disputed by among others Rowan Williams, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and Mary McAleese, the President of Ireland, in their accounts of meetings with him in 2003. After John Paul II's death, Williams told The Sunday Times of a meeting with the Pope, during which he had paid tribute to one of John Paul's encyclicals. According to Williams, John Paul II showed no recognition . An aide whispered in the pope's ear, but was overheard reminding John Paul about the encyclical. However the Pope still showed no recognition. Papal critic John Cornwell claimed that, after Williams and his entourage left, the Pope turned to an aide and asked \\"tell me, who were those people?\\"John Cornwell, The Pope in Winter: The Dark Side of John Paul II's Papacy (Penguin, 2005) p. 267. According to Cornwell, Mary McAleese told the British Catholic newspaper The Universe of a visit as President of Ireland to John Paul where he struggled to talk about the Irish College in Rome, where Irish seminarians in the city are trained and to which the Pope prior to his election had often travelled. \\"He wanted to be reminded of where the Irish College was, and when he heard that it was very close to St. John Lateran's basilica he wanted to be reminded where that was too.\\" Final days On 1 February 2005, the Pope was taken to the Gemelli Hospital suffering from acute inflammation and spasm of the larynx, brought on by a bout of influenza. He was released, but in late February 2005 he began having trouble breathing, and he was rushed back. A tracheotomy was performed, allowing him to breathe more easily, but limiting his speaking ability, to which he reacted with evident frustration during a failed attempt at public speaking from the window of the hospital ward. On Palm Sunday (20 March 2005) the Pope made a brief appearance at his window and silently waved an olive branch to pilgrims. Two days later there were renewed concerns for his health after reports stated that he had taken a turn for the worse and was not responding to medication. By the end of the month, speculation was growing. The Vatican officials confirmed that he was nearing death when on March 31, 2005 at around 11:00 am, the pope, who had gone to the chapel to celebrate Mass, was beset by strong shivers which was followed by high fever because of a urinary tract infection. Despite the use of antibiotics, the disease continued and he developed sepsis and multiple organ failure. He was not rushed to the hospital again, however, and equipment for medical monitoring was brought to his residence in the Vatican, where he was followed by a team of top physicians. On 2 April 2005 at 9:37 pm, he died in his apartment at 84 years and 319 days of age, 46 days before his 85th birthday. The pope is reported to have died looking towards the window as he prayed, raising his right hand as if he is aware of the crowds present in St. Peter's Square where he made an effort to say \\"Amen\\" and his life ended. The illumination of a third light in the papal apartment makes some onlookers in the square knew that the end had come. His death was confirmed when an electrocardiogram signal remained flat for more than 20 minutes. The Pope was the third-longest serving Pope ever in history, after the first Pope St. Peter and Pope Pius IX. He died after 26 years and 162 days of papacy. He was buried in presence of millions on 8 April 2005.

It is the administrative centre of the Nyasvizh District (rajon) of Minsk Region and site of Niasvi≈æ Castle a World Heritage Site. Its 2009 population is 14,300. History Nesvizh was first documented in 1223, becoming after the Union of Krewo (1385) part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and in 1569 part of the Republic of the Two Nations. In the 15th century, while still a minor town, it belonged to the Kiszka family and later to the Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç family, and remained the family's seat until 1813. 17th-century view of the town In 1561 or 1562 Maciej Kawƒôczy≈Ñski founded the print works of the Polish Brethren.J√≥zef ≈Åukaszewicz, Dzieje ko≈õcio≈Ç√≥w wyznania helweckiego w Litwie, t. 2, Pozna≈Ñ 1822, p. 180-181 The first Belarusian language book printed in Latin script, a catechism by Symon Budny, was published in Nesvizh in 1562. The Nie≈õwie≈º Bible (Biblia nie≈õwieska), one of the oldest Polish translations of the Bible, also by Budny, was completed there in 1571 and published in 1572. Nesvizh Castle was erected in 1583, and between 1584 and 1598 the Benedictines and Jesuit religious orders founded monasteries and a college. At the request of Miko≈Çaj \\"the Orphan\\" Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç Nie≈õwie≈º was granted Magdeburg town rights by King Stephen B√°thory in 1586. Two epidemics affected the city early in the 17th century which led to the establishment of a pharmacy in 1627. During the Great Northern War of 1700‚Äì21, the city was significantly damaged by Swedish troops. It was rebuilt in the 1720s by Micha≈Ç \\"Rybe≈Ñko\\" Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç. In the aftermath of the war, in 1740s and 1750s he founded a Pas slucki factory which was later moved to Sluck. He introduced a military school, several textile factories and restored the Corpus Christi Church and opened a print works. Micha≈Ç's wife, Franciszka Urszula Radziwi≈Ç≈Çowa, founded the Nie≈õwie≈º Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç Theatre, including a choir and a ballet school. 19th-century view of the town Between 1764 and 1768 the city was occupied by Russian troops, and in 1772, at the First Partition of Lithuania-Poland, the library, which comprised circa 10,000 volumes, along with paintings and other art objects, was seized and transferred to St. Petersburg. Some books from the library were passed to the Russian Academy of Sciences. Nesvizh Castle in interwar Poland After the Second partition of Lithuania-Poland in 1793, Nie≈õwie≈º was annexed by Russia, and renamed Nesvizh. In 1906, the Polish Society \\"O≈õwiata\\" (\\"Education\\") in Nesvizh was established, but its activities were hampered by the Russian administration, before banning it at the start of 1910. In 1912 the Russian authorities also liquidated the Roman Catholic Charity Society in Nesvizh. After the fall of tsarist Russia, fighting broke out for control over the city and surrounding region. During the Soviet occupation (Polish‚ÄìSoviet War), the unsuccessful Nie≈õwie≈º uprising by Polish residents took place during March 14‚Äì19, 1919. However, Nie≈õwie≈º was recaptured by Poles on April 19, 1919 and re-integrated with the reestablished Polish state. It was became a powiat in the Nowogr√≥dek Voivodeship until the Soviet invasion of Poland in September 1939. During World War II, from 1939 to 1941 it was under Soviet occupation, from 1941 to 1944 under German occupation, and from 1944 to 1945 under Soviet occupation again, before it was once more taken from the territory of Poland and annexed by the Soviet Union, in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement.

With the occupation from June 27, 1941, a Judenrat was established. On October 30, 4,000 of the town's Jews were murdered and the rest confined to a ghetto. On July 20, 1942, the ghetto was surrounded by Belorussian police and the German commander announced that the ghetto's population would be liquidated with the exception of 30 essential skilled workers. The ghetto's underground organization, based on a Soviet-era Zionist group, called an uprising armed only with one machine gun, small arms but mostly knives. Most of the Jews were killed. A few escaped to nearby forests and joined partisan units, such as the Zhukov Jewish partisan unit.Shalom Cholawski, Nesvizh in the Encyclopedia of the Holocaust, vol. 3, pp.1043-1044 Main sights * Nesvizh Castle, the family complex of the Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç family, is a World Heritage Site. * The Corpus Christi Church, built between 1587 and 1593, is one of the earliest Jesuit churches in the world and one of the first baroque buildings in the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth.

Together with Hans G. Kresse's Eric de Noorman and Pieter Kuhn's Kapitein Rob it is regarded as the Big Three of Dutch comics. Tom Poes was a funny animal comic, published in text comics format. The main protagonists are Tom Poes, a white anthropomorphic cat, and his best friend, lord Oliver B. Bumble (Olivier B. Bommel in Dutch). The series is sometimes referred to as the Bommelsaga as well. Toonder received many awards and honorary distinctions for both his illustrations and literary output. In the Netherlands Tom Poes became regarded as a work of literature. Origins In 1931 Marten Toonder was in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where he met Jim Davis, a former assistant of Pat Sullivan and Otto Messmer, creators of Felix the Cat, who taught him some lessons in drawing comics.Marten Toonder Autobiografie, , uitg. De Bezige Bij, 1998, hoofdstuk XIII. On March 16, 1941 the first Tom Poes comic, Het Geheim der Blauwe Aarde (\\"The Secret of the Blue Earth\\") was published in the newspaper De Telegraaf, written and drawn by Toonder, replacing the Mickey Mouse comic in 1941. Tom Poes himself was already created in July 1939.Heer Bommel - Volledige Werken - De dagbladpublicaties Band 1, pagina 189 The name of the character is a pun on the Dutch pastry \\"tompouce\\" and was thought up by Toonder's wife, Phiny Dick. On December 18 of that same year the series was published in the two-weekly Czech magazine Punta.Volledige Werken , band 1, pagina 199. After the war the stories were published in NRC Handelsblad, De Volkskrant, Ons Vrij Nederland, Revue and Donald Duck. In daily newspapers Tom Poes was published as a text comic, like most Dutch comics at the time. In the weekly magazines it was published in balloon format. Tom Poes features many anthropomorphic characters who are satirical representations of animal stereotypes, though some human characters like gnomes and wizards exist too. The series is set in a fantasy world of an undetermined age. Some elements are modern, like cars and television sets, others are more reminiscent of older centuries. Tom Poes was originally a children's comic, but as the stories progressed they aimed at a more adult audience by introducing satirical elements and eccentric use of language. Several of Toonder's words and expressions became neologisms in the Dutch language. In 1954 Toonder became member of the Maatschappij der Nederlandse Letterkunde (\\"Society of Dutch literature\\") and by the time the story De Bovenbazen (The Upper Bosses) was published he was regarded as a creator of genuine quality literature. Tom Poes is still the only comic strip in the Netherlands to have gained such a reputation among the intelligentsia. The success of the series spread to many merchandising products, including theatrical plays and a comics magazine. Toonder founded his own studio and collected several talented artists to assist him with the drawing of Tom Poes, while he still wrote the stories. Among these were Lo Hartog van Banda, Piet Wijn and Dick Matena. From the time Toonder settled down in Ireland in 1965 to the end of Tom Poes in 1986, Toonder reportedly drew Tom Poes almost singlehandedly, having grown weary of running a large studio.Toonder, Marten: Tom Puss 1. p. 2. Alvglans f√∂rlag, 1979. The series was also translated and published in Belgium, Denmark, England, Finland, France, Germany, Indonesia, Ireland and Sweden. Main characters * Tom Puss: A young white cat. He is clever, brave and remains calm in all circumstances. He frequently throws in a critical ‚ÄúHm!‚Äù during conversations with his noble friend. * Oliver B. Bumble: A brown bear who is a lord who lives in a castle. Olivier often brags about himself, but in reality he is not very bright and panics whenever actual work has to be done or danger is about. Several of his catch phrases have entered the Dutch language, such as \\"Als je begrijpt wat ik bedoel\\" (\\"If you gather my meaning\\"), \\"Een eenvoudige, doch voedzame maaltijd\\" (\\"A simple, yet nourishing meal\\") and \\"Verzin toch een list!\\" (\\"Think up a ploy!\\") Supporting characters Dutch names. * Joost: A white labrador who serves as Bommel's loyal butler. His catchphrases are: \\"Met uw welnemen\\" (\\"If you allow me\\") and: \\"Het is allemaal zeer betreurenswaardig\\" (\\"It's all very regrettable\\"). In several adventures, he quits, but at the end of every adventure he is back at his post, serving dinner. * Annemarie Doddeltje: A small cat who is Bommel's girlfriend and in full awe and concern about him. They marry in the final story. * Querulijn Xaverius Marquis de Canteclaer van Barneveldt: A rooster who is Bommel's neighbour. He is a marquis who often uses French and Latin expressions and writes poems. De Canteclaer is very vain and looks down on all his fellow men, especially on Bommel whom he regards as below his league, and not belonging to the nobility like him. His name is a reference to Chanticleer and to Barneveld, a Dutch town famous for its poultry. * Wammes Waggel: A na√Øve goose who can't take a thing seriously and just enjoys life as he goes along. He never understands what is going on around him, despite how serious the matter often is. His catchphrase is \\"Hihi, wat enigjes\\" (\\"Teehee, how nicely\\") * Officer Bulle Bas: A bull dog who is head of the police. He is prone to aggression and very suspicious. Usually he tries to arrest Bommel and others even though he hardly has any evidence. \\"Altijd dezelfde\\" (\\"Always the same person\\") and \\"Wat is je naam, Bommel?\\" (\\"What is your name, Bommel?\\") are some of his standard phrases. * Brigadier Snuf: A dog who is the right hand of Officer Bulle Bas. * Bul Super and Hiep Hieper: Two dogs who are crooks. Bul is a bull dog who acts as the boss of the duo. Hieper is a smaller white dog who admires his boss, but is often too panicky to actually take initiative himself. * Mayor Dirk Dickerdack: A hippopotamus who is mayor of Rommeldam, the characters' home town. He is more concerned about his town than individuals and considers himself above the law. * Dorknoper: A hamster who works as a civil servant for Mayor Dickerdack. He is very punctual and always wants to do everything according to local law. * Professor Zbygniew Prlwytzkofsky: One of the few recurring human characters. He is a professor with a long beard who often mixes Dutch and German words in his speech. \\"Praw! Der hemeldonderweder!\\" are words that come from his mouth. * Doctorandus Alexander Pieps: A mouse who serves as Prlwytzkofsky's assistant. He often sighs that he'd rather have studied for a different job. * Captain Wal Rus: A walrus who is a sea captain. He looks down upon everyone who isn't a sailor like him and calls them \\"overgehaalde landrotten\\" (\\"distorted land lubbers\\"). He always mispronounces Bommel's name. * Professor Dr. Joachim Sickbock: A goat who is one of the major antagonists. He is a mad scientist. * Terpen Tijn: One of the few recurring human characters. He is an egotistical painter who uses esoteric language to describe the magic of his art as ‚Äúsubtle vibrations‚Äù (Dutch: fijne trillingen), criticizing the rude materialist views of mr. Bumble, which does not prevent him from accepting his money and meals. * Amos W. Steinhacker: A frog who is a money obsessed businessman who prefers to be addressed using his initials AWS (‚ÄúDon‚Äôt call me Steinhacker! I‚Äôm not a poor schmuck!‚Äù) * Steenbreek: A dog who serves as Steinhacker's secretary. * Garmt Grootgrut: A sheep who serves as the local grocer. Whenever something happens to his shop he complains how \\"hardworking shopkeepers are always the victim.\\" His name became an eponym in the Dutch language: \\"grootgrutter\\", used for big store owners. * Drs. Okke Zielknijper: A llama who works as a psychiatrist, patronizing his patients using social worker gibberish (‚ÄúI often saw this in my practice‚Äù) or having them locked up in a padded cell by his gorilla assistant. * O. Fanth Mzn: An elephant who serves as publisher and chief editor of the local newspaper. * Argus: A sensation seeking rat who works as a journalist for O. Fanth Mzn. He is a cousin of Alexander Pieps. * Kwetal: A gnome. His Dutch name can be read als \\"'k Weet al\\" (= \\"I know everything\\") - but he is a very modest person. In the adventures, it becomes clear that he really knows a lot, but he uses terms and expressions that are not used in the scientific world, and part of his knowledge is about ancient forces and mysteries. He admires modern inventions, but sometimes does not clearly understand why they are useful. * Pee Pastinakel: Another gnome. He is the gardener of the woods. He is equipped with some form of synaesthesia, as in observing: ‚ÄúThis smells red!‚Äù in a dangerous situation. * Hocus P. Pas: An evil wizard who is one of the few human characters in the series. He is accompanied by (and can transform himself into) a crow-like bird. He curses his opponents using names of ancient demons: ‚ÄúBy Zazel and Iod! Serpents on your path!‚Äù He is always on the search for extension of his life by extracting life energy from his victims, using black magic. * Pastuiven Verkwil: A rat who works as a button salesman. He often tries to start a fight for matters he presumes to be injustice, including his own small height. * Joris Goedbloed: A sly fox who is a con-artist. He is also a recurring character in Toonder's other series Panda. * Zedekia Zwederkoorn: A rat who is a lawyer or rather a bibacious pettifogger. Film adaptation In 1983 an animated film based on the comics was released: The Dragon That Wasn't (Or Was He?). Radio adaptation From 2007 to 2010 Tom Poes was adapted into a series of audio plays broadcast on the Dutch radio channels NPO Radio 6, NPO Radio 6 and NPO Radio 1. In popular culture On July 12, 2002 a six-meter public monument was built in Rotterdam, honoring several characters from the franchise. It was designed by D.J. Chantelle, Pepijn van den Nieuwendijk, Hans van Bentem and Luuk Bode.

Patrick Gymnasium is a 3,228 seat (3,266 for men's and women's basketball) multi-purpose arena in Burlington, Vermont. It was built in 1963 to replace the Old Gymnasium, a then-60-year-old facility now known as the Royall Tyler Theater. It is used mainly as the home arena of the Vermont Catamounts men's and women's basketball teams. It has been the site of the 2004, 2005, 2007, 2010, 2013, 2017, 2018 and 2019 America East men's basketball tournament championship games, as the higher seed in the final hosts the game. The championship games were all televised on ESPN or ESPN2. Vermont has consistently been among the America East leaders in home attendance and in 2004‚Äì05, it became the only America East men's basketball program to sell out every game for an entire season. Patrick Gym is also a concert venue, seating up to 4,000. It can also accommodate conventions and trade shows; there are of arena floor space, with an additional at the indoor track and at the indoor tennis courts, both of which are adjacent to Patrick Gymnasium. The current bleachers at Patrick Gym were installed in 1982, and new lighting and the current floor were installed in 1990. Currently the university has plans to replace the over 50 year old Patrick Gym with a new event center next to Gutterson Fieldhouse. The new arena will have a capacity of 3,200 with a price tag of $80 million. It was announced in December 2018 that the new arena will be named the Tarrant Event Center, in honor of Rich and Deb Tarrant who donated $15 million to the project. The arena was originally intended to be ready for the 2020‚Äì21 school year, but construction delays and financial uncertainties due to the COVID-19 pandemic have pushed back the most likely date for completion of the new arena to 2022‚Äì23. Once the basketball programs move to the Tarrant Center, Patrick Gym will be converted into a campus recreation facility. Events Patrick Gym is also used as the venue for the Vermont State Division I Boys and Girls Basketball Championship semifinals and final. The Boston Celtics held their training camp at Patrick Gym prior to the start of the 2004‚Äì05 NBA season. In the 1960s, the Celtics played several exhibition games at Patrick Gym. =America East Championship= The gym has played host to many America East championship games because of Vermont men's basketball success in the conference tournament. On March 10, 2018 Vermont hosted UMBC in the America East Championship game. Jairus Lyles hit the game winning three pointer to clinch the America East Championship and advance to the NCAA Tournament, which would later turn out to be a historic run for UMBC. The very next season, Vermont returned the favor by beating UMBC 66‚Äì49. It was the sixth time UVM had clinched the America East championship and a bid to the NCAA Tournament, and the fifth time they'd accomplished the feat at Patrick Gym.

Salvelinus is a member of the subfamily Salmoninae within the family Salmonidae. The genus has a northern circumpolar distribution, and most of its members are typically cold-water fish that primarily inhabit fresh waters. Many species also migrate to the sea. Most char may be identified by light-cream, pink, or red spots over a darker body. Scales tend to be small, with 115-200 along the lateral line. The pectoral, pelvic, anal, and the lower aspect of caudal fins are trimmed in snow white or cream leading edges. Many members of this genus are popular sport fish, and a few, such as lake trout (S. namaycush) and arctic char (S. alpinus) are objects of commercial fisheries and/or aquaculture. Occasionally, such fish escape and become invasive species. Deepwater char are small species of char living below 80 m in the deep areas of certain lakes. They are highly sensitive to changes in the quality of the water and one species, Salvelinus neocomensis, was driven to extinction in the twentieth century.Red List - Volume 1: Vertebrates (2009) - General assessment for the vertebrate groups  Taxonomy  There are currently three subgenera in the genus Salvelinus: Baione, Cristovomer, and Salvelinus sensu stricto. Baione, the most basal clade in the genus, contains the brook trout (S. fontinalis), and the presumably extinct silver trout (S. agassizii). Cristovomer contains only the lake trout (S. namaycush). All other species are in the subgenus Salvelinus. If the long-finned char (Salvethymus svetovidovi) is considered a member of the genus Salvelinus, it would be classified in the subgenus Salvethymus, adding a fourth subgenus. Species diversity As with other salmonid genera, the delimitation of species in Salvelinus is controversial. FishBase in 2015 listed 54 species or subspecies in this genus, many of which have very narrow local distributions. Fourteen localised species are listed from the British Isles alone, although these traditionally, and still by the national conservation and fisheries authorities, are all considered to represent the widespread Arctic charr (S. alpinus). Twenty species are listed from the Asian part of Russia, including several localised taxa from in each of the Kamchatka, Chukotka and Taimyr peninsulas. One of these is the long-finned char, which phylogenetically is part of the Salvelinus group although it has been so far classified into another genus Salvethymus.Alexander G. Osinov, Anna L. Senchukova, Nikolai S. Mugue, Sergei D. Pavlov, Igor A. Chereshnev (2015) Speciation and genetic divergence of three species of charr from ancient Lake El'gygytgyn (Chukotka) and their phylogenetic relationships with other representatives of the genus Salvelinus Biological Journal of the Linnean Society 116, 63‚Äì85. The Arctic char (S. alpinus) is the most broadly distributed Salvelinus species. It has a circumpolar distribution, and it is considered the most northern of all freshwater fishes. In North America, five relatively well defined species are present, which, apart from the Arctic char, comprise the brook trout (S. fontinalis), bull trout (S. confluentus), Dolly Varden trout (S. malma) and lake trout (S. namaycush).

Its relation to the original Zip drive and disk is the floppy medium and relatively much higher capacity than standard floppy disks. It was known as the \\"Clik!\\" drive until the click of death class action lawsuit regarding mass failures of Iomega's Zip drives. Thenceforth, it was renamed to PocketZip. A 100 MB Pocket Zip drive version had been in the works, was intended to be backwards compatible with the 40 MB disks, but ended up being vaporware and PocketZip itself would be discontinued as well. PocketZip drive and media Iomega Clik! PocketZip Drive and Media The PocketZip drive was available originally as a laptop PC card (PCMCIA) slot drive where it could compete with contemporary PC card, MicroDrive, CompactFlash and SmartMedia readers. A dock was available to connect this drive to a desktop computer's parallel port. Later, a USB version of the drive was also offered. It was marketed as a backup and portable storage solution, similar to the original Zip drive, but which could be installed completely inside a laptop computer, as PC cards typically slide completely inside the laptop computer and thus do not increase its dimensions, which also precludes the need for a power supply or cables. The PocketZip media is a small, flexible disk inside of a thin metal casing, similar to that found on the shutter of a standard floppy disk. The disks usually came in small format-specific plastic cases, and the drive was also shipped for a while with a small hard metal case - identical, but unrelated to the Aluma Wallet - which could house the drive and two disks. The disks could be bent easily if too much force was applied, thereby completely damaging them.  Use in consumer electronics The format was also used in a small number of consumer electronics devices such as mp3 players and digital cameras. These include the Iomega HipZip Digital Audio Player, the Sensory Science Rave MP 2300, and the Agfa ePhoto CL30 Clik. The format saw use in other devices as well but proved to be a commercial failure. It suffered heavy competition from flash-based memory cards. The PocketZip was electro- mechanical and, hence, not as reliable as solid-state flash memory cards which have no moving parts. Also, as the capacity and speed of flash memory storage increased and its costs decreased, the PocketZip lost viability as a portable storage solution. Specifications (from Iomega support site): *Capacity: 40 MByte *Seek Time: 38 ms *Sustained transfer rate: Up to 600 kByte/s *Rotational speed: 2941 RPM *Short format time: 10 seconds *Long format time: 5 minutes *Average start/stop time: 3 seconds *Disk shelf life: 10 years = Operating system support= According to the original documentation, Pocket Zip USB and PC Card work with Windows 95, Windows 98/98SE and Windows NT 4.0. Iomega provided USB mass storage support for Windows 95 with at least OSR2 (4.00.950B) for use with its Zip products. Under Windows NT 4, Pocket Zip PC Card only works with certain PC Card controllers (which ones are not named by Iomega). Pocket Zip USB also works with Mac OS 8.x, but the PC card version is specified as not working with Apple computers. In practice, the USB drive is a standard mass storage device, so it will also work on any modern operating system which can use such devices, including Windows XP, Vista and 7, Mac OS X and Linux. The PC card drive, similarly, is a standard removable ATA device, so it also will typically function without any problems on modern operating systems including Windows XP.

Considered to be one of the leading portrait painters of the Dutch Golden Age, his elegant portraits gained him the patronage of Amsterdam's elite as well as the Stadtholder's circle.Walter A. Liedtke, Dutch Paintings in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Volumes 1-2, Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2007, pp. 223-331 Besides portraits, van der Helst painted a few genre pictures as well as some biblical scenes and mythological subjects.Rudolf E. O. Ekkart. \\"Helst, Bartholomeus van der.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press, accessed 15 May 2017 Life Bartholomeus van der Helst was born in Haarlem in 1613. His exact date of birth is not known as the birth records of Haarlem of that time are lost. He was the son of a Haarlem innkeeper called Lodewijk and his second wife, Aeltgen Bartels. Van der Helst had moved to Amsterdam some time before 1636, the year in which he married there Anna du Pire, an 18-year-old woman from a prosperous family from the Southern Netherlands who was already orphaned. The couple had six children of whom one called Lodewijk (1642 - c. 1684) became a portrait painter like his father.Website about Bartholomeus van der Helst Pieter Lucaszn van de Venne and Anna de Carpentier with their child His first dated picture, the Regents of the Walloon Orphanage in Amsterdam, dates from 1637. The style of this painting suggests that in Amsterdam van der Helst may have trained with Nicolaes Eliaszoon Pickenoy. His first important commission was for a large schuttersstuk known as the Civic Guard led by Captain Roelof Bicker and Lieutenant Jan Michielsz. Blaeuw. Van der Helst received the commission in 1639 and finished it in 1642. The large 7.5m wide canvas was hung over the fireplace of the grand assembly of the Kloveniers guild, the same room for which Rembrandt painted The Night Watch. The success, which the artist achieved with this composition, led to many commissions for single and double portraits of Amsterdam's leading class such as his Portrait of Andries Bicker, the mayor of Amsterdam. The city's military brass and wealthy members of the regent class all had portraits made by van der Helst. Banquet of the Amsterdam Civic Guard in Celebration of the Peace of M√ºnster Even though van der Helst was active in Amsterdam at the same time as Rembrandt, he was able to become the most popular portraitist in that city, through his elegant and flattering portrayals in the style of Anthony van Dyck. His work was considered more immediately appealing than the dark, intense and introspective work during this later period of Rembrandt.Bartholomeus van der Helst at the J. Paul Getty Museum Rare among portrait artists in Amsterdam of his time, he was able to attract bourgeois patrons from other cities such as Rotterdam. His large group portrait, Banquet of the Amsterdam Civic Guard in Celebration of the Peace of M√ºnster (Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam), was painted in 1648, and exhibited to popular acclaim. It was this painting that sealed his fame for future generations, according to the Dutch artist biographer Arnold Houbraken.Arnold Houbraken, Bartholomeus vander Helst biography in: De groote schouburgh der Nederlandsche konstschilders en schilderessen, 1718 The painting was admired by Godfried Kneller and Joshua Reynolds. Van der Helst received a commission from the circle of the Stadtholder family, when he was asked in 1652 to paint the portrait of Mary, the widow of William II, Prince of Orange. Mourning portrait of a dead child The artist remained active throughout his life and maintained a high level of production until the end of his career. His late works such as the pendant portraits of Lieutenant-Admiral Aert van Nes and his wife Geertruida den Dubbeld and Vice-Admiral Johan de Liefde (all three dated 1668 and in the Rijksmuseum) still set the trend in portrait painting in his age. The harbour scenes in the background in these three works were painted by Ludolf Bakhuizen. He was the teacher of his son Lodewijk who followed his style.Bartholomeus van der Helst at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Marcus Waltes was his pupil in 1650.Judith van Gent, Bartholomeus van der Helst blog He had no other known pupils but exerted an influence on Govert Flinck, Eustache Lesueur, Constantin Hansen, Alexander Sanders and Abraham van den Tempel. The artist died in Amsterdam in 1670. While the artist had been able to charge very high prices for his work, he appears to have lived above his means. He had bought a large house and acquired many paintings of leading artists such as Frans Floris, Simon de Vos, Goltzius, Adriaen Brouwer, Pieter Lastman, Gerard van Zyl, Simon de Vlieger, Hendrik Gerritsz Pot, Otto Marcelis and Willem van de Velde. After his death his wife was compelled to offer his works and those from his art collection for sale in 1671 in an advertisement in the Haarlems Dagblad.Advertisements in the Oprechte Haerlemse Courant of 1671 Work =General= A young woman holding a sunflower In addition to the portraits for which he is most famous, Bartholomeus van der Helst painted a few genre, historical, biblical, mythological and allegorical scenes.Bartholomeus van der Helst, A Young Woman Holding a Sunflower At Otto Naumann In all these paintings, the portrait aspect is still important. =Portraits= Bartholomeus van der Helst was principally a painter of portraits. The majority of his work is made up of individual portraits. He also painted family portraits, double portraits and pendant portraits. An example of the latter are the portraits of Lieutenant-Admiral Aert van Nes and his wife Geertruida den Dubbeld. Among his most prestigious assignments were the group portraits of Amsterdam 'schutters' (civil militia members) and regents. The most famous work in this category is his 1648 Banquet of the Amsterdam Civic Guard in Celebration of the Peace of M√ºnster (Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam).Judith van Gent, Stilistische ontwikkeling at Bartholomeus van der Helst blog In this large-scale composition depicting 25 people, van der Helst was able to do justice to each individual. He also realised a clear composition through his sophisticated use of light and color.S. A. C. Dudcok van Heel, Bartholomeus van der Helst (Haarlem 1613 ‚Äì 1670 Amsterdam), The Marriage Portraits of Gabriel Marselis and Maria van Arckel, at Otto Naumann Ltd, 2013 As a portrait painter to Amsterdam's elite, he created life-sized portraits, which responded to the demand of the patricians of Amsterdam for portraits that offered a good likeness rather than an idealized image. His style is characterized by clear drawing, plasticity, even lighting and a pleasant palette relying on light and clear tones. He preferred balanced compositions.Judith van Gent, Stilistische ontwikkeling at Bartholomeus van der Helst blog Jan J. Hinlopen in 1665, with his second wife Lucia Wijbrants His early works show the influence of Pickenoy, his presumed master, and to a certain extent of Rembrandt. This is clear in the Portrait of an unknown man, probably a Protestant minister of 1638 (Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen). It shows a man reading a book who looks up at the viewer as if he has been disturbed, a motive derived from Rembrandt. The vivid representation of the sitter is characteristic of van der Helst's early work. Van der Helst found his own style in the 1640s. The Portrait of Andries Bicker dated 1642 (Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam) is typical his work from this period: it is well modeled, of a strong plasticity and painted with a barely visible brush stroke. The fashion for the French elegant style was visible in his work after 1650. An example is the Portrait of the animal painter Paulus Potter painted in 1654 (Mauritshuis, The Hague). This work was based on a self-portrait of Potter, which he had made shortly before his early death. The gestures and movements of the sitter in the painting are elegant. The artist has further succeeded in rendering the fabrics in a smooth painting style and almost perfect technique. The paintings of the final years of van der Helst's career are characterized by increased attention to detail and a more even lighting. The subtlety and intensity that characterizes his earlier work has made way for a clarity of expression that leaves nothing to the imagination. The artist also used a more colourful palette and richer contrasts and emphasized more strongly the distinctions between dark and light tones.Bartholomeus van der Helst, Portrait of a gentleman against a drapery backdrop at Dorotheum Gerard Andriesz Bicker =Portrait of Gerard Andriesz Bicker= One of van der Helst's most famous works is the portrait of Gerard Andriesz Bicker at half- length of 1639 (Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam). Van der Helst painted in 1642 a portrait of Andries Bicker, the father of Gerard Andriesz Bicker and the mayor of Amsterdam, as a pendant to this work. The contrast between the two sitters could not be more pronounced: while the father looks like a stern and sober Protestant, the son looks like a fanciful dandy with a smug look in his eyes. At the time the painting was made Gerard Andriesz Bicker was only 17 years old, but already held the titles of Lord of Engelenburg and High Bailiff of Muiden. This portrait is often used to illustrate the decadent wealth of the Amsterdam merchants of the Dutch Golden Age in Amsterdam.Maarten Levendig, Bartholomeus van der Helst: Portrait of Gerard Andriesz. Bicker (1639); Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam =Genre scenes= Bartholomeus van der Helst also painted a number of genre scenes. An example of a genre scene by van der Helst is the View of the Nieuwmarkt (1638, Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg), which combines still life, cityscape and figure piece. The composition shows an old woman holding a big wheelbarrow full of vegetables. On her left hangs the carcass of large slaughtered pig. Next to the pig are four children, one of whom blows the pig's bladder while the others look at the viewer. In the background is a view on the Nieuwmarkt with the Sint Anthoniswaag. This work was probably made for van der Helst's private use as it likely depicts the view from his house on the Nieuwmarkt. Another genre scene is The Musician (1662, Metropolitan Museum of Art), which depicts a woman tuning a theorbo while a viola da gamba is resting in front of her. Printed music in tenor and soprano parts is placed on a table nearby. The musician looks directly at the viewer as if inviting him to take up the viola da gamba to join her in a duet. While the work has usually been regarded as a genre scene, it is possible that it is in fact a portrait of Anna du Pire, the artist's wife.Bartholomeus van der Helst, The musician at the Metropolitan Museum of Art The Nieuwmarkt in Amsterdam =Collaborations= As was common in 17th century Dutch artistic practice, Bartholomeus van der Helst regularly collaborated with other specialist artists. A frequent collaborator was Ludolf Bakhuizen, a prominent marine and landscape painter. Bakhuizen painted the marine scenes, which are the backdrop of his portraits of the Dutch naval heroes Vice-Admiral Johan de Liefde and Lieutenant-Admiral Aert van Nes with the pendant portrait of his wife Geertruida den Dubbeld (all three dated 1668 and in the Rijksmuseum). An interesting case of a collaboration between multiple Golden Age painters is the Portrait of Willem van Wyttenhorst. No less than four painters had a hand in its creation: Bartholomeus van der Helst, Cornelis van Poelenburgh, Jan Both and Jacob Duck. Van der Helst was responsible for the general composition and Jan Both for the landscape. It is possible that Duck painted the harness as he was a specialist in guardroom scenes (also called 'kortegards'), which depicted soldiers at leisure among their weapons, harnesses and other military gear in a guardroom. It is likely that van der Helst also painted the face but the role of van Poelenburgh is not clear.N.C. Sluijter-Seijffert, Cornelis van Poelenburch als portretschilder, in: E. Buijsen, Ch. Dumas, V. Manuth (red.), Face Book. Studies on Dutch and Flemish Portraiture of the 16th-18th Centuries. Liber Amicorum presented to Rudolf E.O. Ekkart on the occasion of his 65th Birthday, Leiden 2012, pp. 161-166 Van der Helst also collaborated with the animal painter Jan Baptist Weenix on the Shepherd boy with sheep and goats. Bartholomeus van der Helst painted the shepherd boy in the painting. Van der Helst scratched his signature in the wet paint on the boy's collar while Weenix did the same in the wet paint at the upper right. It is believed the painting was intended to be hung over a large fireplace. This probably explains the contrived perspective with the somewhat too large sheep placed right on the edge in the foreground.Jan Baptist Weenix and Bartholomeus van der Helst, Shepherd boy with sheep and goats at Sotheby's Gallery File:Bartholomeus van der Helst - Paul Potter.jpgPortrait of the animal painter Paulus Potter File:Bartholomeus van der Helst - Portrait of a Boy (blowing Bubbles).jpgPortrait of a boy blowing bubbles File:Bartholomeus van der Helst - Portrait of Captain Gideon de Wildt - Google Art Project.jpgPortrait of Captain Gideon de Wildt File:Mary Princess of Orange.jpgMary, Princess of Orange File:Daniel Bernard, by Bartholomeus van der Helst.jpgThe shipowner Daniel Bernard File:Jacob Trip (1627-1670), by Bartholomeus van der Helst.jpgThe arms dealer Jacob Trip (1627-1670) File:Aert van Nes (1626-93), luitenant-admiraal, by Bartholomeus van der Helst.jpgLieutenant-Admiral Aert van Nes (1626‚Äì93) File:Geertruida den Dubbelde, de echtgenote van luitenant-admiraal Aert van Nes, by Bartholomeus van der Helst.jpgGeertruida den Dubbeld, wife of Lieutenant-Admiral Aert van Nes File:Shepherds boy with sheep and goats, by Jan Baptist Weenix and Bartholomeus van der Helst.jpgShepherd boy with sheep and goats, together with Jan Baptist Weenix File:The Musician MET ep73.2.R.jpgThe Musician File:Bartholomeus van der Helst.jpgThe artist's wife Anna du Pire as Granida File:Bartholomeus van der Helst - Jonge ontsluierde vrouw heft een gordijn op.jpgNude young woman lifting a curtain References External links Category:1613 births Category:1670 deaths Category:Artists from Haarlem Category:Artists from Amsterdam Category:Dutch Golden Age painters Category:Dutch male painters Category:Dutch genre painters Category:Dutch portrait painters ","title":"Bartholomeus van der Helst"},{"id":"1897121","text":"Pope John Paul II's relations with the Eastern Orthodox Church were marked by a significant improvement in relations between Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy. Pentecost: The spread of Christianity begins. Romania In May 1999, Pope John Paul II visited Romania on the invitation from Patriarch Teoctist of the Romanian Orthodox Church. This was the first time a Pope had visited a predominantly Eastern Orthodox country since the East-West Schism in 1054, the event that separated Eastern Orthodoxy and Western Catholicism. On his arrival, the Patriarch and the President of Romania, Emil Constantinescu, greeted the Pope. The Patriarch stated, \\"The second millennium of Christian history began with a painful wounding of the unity of the Church; the end of this millennium has seen a real commitment to restoring Christian unity.\\" Patriarch of Romania On 9 May, the Pope and the Patriarch each attended a worship service conducted by the other (an Orthodox Liturgy and a Catholic Mass, respectively). A crowd of hundreds of thousands of people turned up to attend the worship services, which were held in the open air. The Pope told the crowd, \\"I am here among you pushed only by the desire of authentic unity. Not long ago it was unthinkable that the bishop of Rome could visit his brothers and sisters in the faith who live in Romania. Today, after a long winter of suffering and persecution, we can finally exchange the kiss of peace and together praise the Lord.\\" A large part of Romania's Orthodox population has shown itself warm to the idea of Christian reunification. Greece During his 2001 travels, John Paul II became the first Pope to visit Greece in 1291 years. In Athens, the Pope met with Archbishop Christodoulos, the head of the Church of Greece. After a private 30 minute meeting, the two spoke publicly. Christodoulos read a list of \\"13 offences\\" of the Roman Catholic Church against the Eastern Orthodox Church since the Great Schism, including the pillaging of Constantinople by crusaders in 1204, and bemoaned the lack of any apology from the Roman Catholic Church, saying ‚ÄúUntil now, there has not been heard a single request for pardon‚Äù for the ‚Äúmaniacal crusaders of the 13th century.‚Äù The Pope responded by saying ‚ÄúFor the occasions past and present, when sons and daughters of the Catholic Church have sinned by action or omission against their Orthodox brothers and sisters, may the Lord grant us forgiveness,‚Äù to which Christodoulos immediately applauded. John Paul II also said that the sacking of Constantinople was a source of ‚Äúprofound regret‚Äù for Catholics. Later John Paul and Christodoulos met on a spot where Saint Paul had once preached to Athenian Christians. They issued a ‚Äòcommon declaration‚Äô, saying ‚ÄúWe shall do everything in our power, so that the Christian roots of Europe and its Christian soul may be preserved. ‚Ä¶ We condemn all recourse to violence, proselytism and fanaticism, in the name of religion‚Äù The two leaders then said the Lord's Prayer together, breaking an Orthodox taboo against praying with Catholics. Bulgaria During the travels between 23 and 26 May 2002 Pope John Paul II visited Bulgaria and met with the Bulgarian Patriarch Maxim. He visited Sofia, Plovdiv and the Rila monastery and told Bulgarian President Georgi Parvanov he never believed that the country participated in organization of the 1981 assassination attempt. Ukraine John Paul II visited another heavily Orthodox area, Ukraine on 23‚Äì27 June 2001 at the invitation of the President of Ukraine and bishops of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church and the Roman Catholic Church in Ukraine. This visit has had a great influence on society of Ukraine. The Pope spoke to leaders of the All- Ukrainian Council of Churches and Religious Organisations, pleading for \\"open, tolerant and honest dialogue\\". About 200 thousand people attended the liturgies celebrated by the Pope in Kiev, and the liturgy in Lviv gathered nearly one and a half million faithful. John Paul II stated that an end to the Great Schism was one of his fondest wishes. Healing divisions between the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches regarding Latin and Byzantine traditions was clearly of great personal interest. For a number of years John Paul II actively sought to facilitate dialogue and unity stating as early as 1988 in Euntes in mundum that \\"Europe has two lungs, it will never breathe easily until it uses both of them\\". Serbia With regard to relations with the Serbian Orthodox Church, Pope John Paul II could not escape the controversy of the involvement of Croatian Catholic clergy with the Ustasa regime of World War II. In 1998, he beatified Aloysius Stepinac, the Croatian war-time Archbishop of Zagreb, a move seen negatively by those who believe that he was an active collaborator with the Usta≈°e fascist regime, which committed genocide against Serbs as well as Jews. On 22 June 2003 he visited Banja Luka in Bosnia and Herzegovina, a city inhabited by many Catholics before the 1992-1995 war, but since then predominantly Orthodox. He held a mass at the Petriƒáevac monastery, a place of considerable controversy and distress, both during World War II and during the Yugoslav wars. Belarus Catholics in Belarus (at least 10-15% of the population) had hoped for the Pope to visit their country, a trip he himself wished to make. Resistance from the Russian Orthodox Church and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, however, meant the visit never happened.  Poland  Pope's relation with Polish Autocephalous Orthodox Church was marked by a series of hostilities. Pope supported Solidarity and catholic option while Polish United Workers' Party pursued russian model with Orthodox Church being marginalized but the only official state religion. Official Party's documents clearly stated that Catholicism should be embraced, extended, and extinguished in favour of Orthodox Church. Russia The Pope had been also saying during his entire pontificate that one of his greatest dreams was to visit Russia, but this never occurred. He had made several attempts to solve the problems which arose over a period of centuries between the Roman Catholic and Russian Orthodox churches, like giving back the Kazan Icon of the Mother of God in August 2004. However, the Orthodox side was not that enthusiastic, making statements like: \\"The question of the visit of the Pope in Russia is not connected by the journalists with the problems between the Churches, which are now unreal to solve, but with giving back one of many sacred things, which were illegally stolen from Russia.\\" (Vsevolod Chaplin).

SAFA was established in 1991. The South African Football Association is the second Football Association in South Africa to be named the South African Football Association and it is also the second football association in South Africa to affiliate to FIFA. The present day South African Football Association, unlike its predecessor allows for a mixed-race national team. SAFA was admitted to FIFA in 1992 and its senior team has since represented South Africa at the Africa Cup of Nations and the FIFA World Cup. During SAFA's time as the FIFA-affiliated football organisation, South Africa has also hosted several editions of the COSAFA Cup, the 1996 Africa Cup of Nations and the 2010 FIFA World Cup. The South African Football Association is responsible for the administration of the South African national football teams (both men's and women's), and the third tier and below of the South African Football league system. The Premier Soccer League administrates the top two divisions and several cup competitions. History =South African Football Association (1892)= The founding of the first football associations in South Africa were influenced by arrival of many British soldiers to South Africa. The original South African Football Association was a white only organization established in 1892. The South African Football Association was the first national governing body on the continent and affiliated to FIFA in 1910. The SAFA of 1892 was the first association on the African continent to become affiliated to FIFA. SAFA withdrew from FIFA in 1924 and later regained full membership in 1952. In 1932, the South African African Football Association (SAAFA) was formed and a year later the South African Bantu Football Association (SABFA) and the South African Coloured Football Association (SACFA) followed suit. In September 1951, the three merged to form the anti-apartheid South African Soccer Federation (SASF). The South African Football Association struggled for the right to represent South African in world football (FIFA) against South African Soccer Federation (SASF) SASF claimed it was the legitimate representative of South Africa considering three-fourths of football players were registered within SASF. SAFA were expected to play in the newly formed Confederation of African Football's 1957 Africa Cup of Nations, however they did not. The minutes of the meetings between SAFA and their counterparts from Ethiopia, Egypt and Sudan were lost to fire and so the official reason for their non-appearance is unknown. Fred Fell, SAFA's representative at FIFA said that SAFA withdrew because of the conflict at the Suez Canal. There were also rumours that they were expelled from the initial competition due to their favourable stance on apartheid. In November 1954, the SASF attempted to join FIFA. In May 1955, FIFA concluded that SAFA does not have \\"the standing of a real national association\\" because it did not control all clubs, there were more clubs and players with SASF than SAFA. SASF's application was rejected because there were no white players. In 1956, FIFA chose to accept SAFA's stance that segregation was a \\"tradition and custom\\" in South Africa. The South African Football Association were renamed to the Football Association of South Africa (FASA) in 1957. The newly renamed association also removed a clause from its constitution excluding non-whites. In his book African Soccerscapes, Professor Peter Alegi says this was to \\"create the perception of substantive change while maintaining the status quo\\". In 1959, the SASF successfully managed to have a FIFA sanctioned game between Brazilian club Portuguesa Santista and white South Africa cancelled, as the Brazilian club had agreed to withdraw its black players from the game. The SASF had complained to the Brazilian consul in Cape Town, the Brazilian government prevented the club from taking part. At FIFA's 1960 Congress in Rome,an anti racism resolution was adopted that demanded the Football Association of South Africa (FASA) integrate football within a year or they would be expelled from FIFA. There were calls from the Soviet bloc and Asia for the South African Soccer Federation (SASF) to become a member of FIFA in place of FASA. The calls were rejected as FIFA's own statutes stated that \\"a National Association must be open to all who practice football in that country whether amateur, 'non-amateur', or professional and without any racial, religious, political discrimination\\". FASA as well as South Africa were also expelled for the Confederation Africaine de Football for discrimination. In September 1961, FASA were suspended from FIFA because of their pro-apartheid stance and refusal to field non-white players. This was the first time a major organization had expelled the administration of South Africa. Also, in 1961 the white-South Africa sympathiser Stanley Rous was elected as FIFA President. Rous and United States citizen Joseph Maguire would later visit white South African officials for two weeks. Rous reported to FIFA that there was no wilful discrimination within FASA and on the basis of his report, FASA were allowed back into FIFA in September 1963. At the Tokyo Congress, the Confederation of African Football members were lobbying for the expulsion of the FASA unless its \\"obnoxious apartheid policy [was] totally eliminated\\". They had retained the support of Soviet and Asian National Associations and held meetings with South African Soccer Federation in Durban and the South African Non-Racial Olympic Committee in London. CAF had already expelled South Africa from its own membership. The request for expulsion from FIFA was downgraded to suspension and it was passed by a majority of associations at the 1964 FIFA Congress. Following the suspension, South Africa were also not allowed to take part in the 1964 and 1968 Olympics and were expelled from the Olympic movement in 1970. During this time Rous had been lobbying to have South Africa re-instated into FIFA and the Olympics. In 1973, Brazilian FIFA President candidate Joao Havelange withdrew Brazil from the 1973 South African Games to curry favour with the anti-apartheid national associations and went to beat Rous in the FIFA Presidential Election. At the FIFA Congress on 16 July 1976 in Montreal, FASA were formally suspended from FIFA. Members of FIFA had voted to exclude South Africa 78 votes to 9. On December 8, 1991 many opposing football associations came together in a \\"unity\\" process that eventually formed a non-racial South African Football Association. In January 1992, the Confederation Africaine de Football also reinstated South Africa into their football organization. = South African Football Association (1991) = The new South African Football Association was founded on 23 March 1991, the culmination of a long unity process that was to rid the sport in South Africa of all its past racial division. A delegation of the SAFA received a standing ovation at the congress of the Confederation of African Football (CAF) in Dakar, Senegal a month later, where South Africa were accorded observer status. South Africa's membership of the world governing body FIFA was confirmed at their congress in Zurich in June 1992. Membership of CAF followed automatically and South Africa was back on the world stage, and were awarded the right to host the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. Within a month the country hosted their first international match as World Cup quarterfinalists Cameroon came to play in three matches to celebrate the unity process. In September 1992, South Africa played its first junior international against Botswana at under-16 level in Lenasia and to date the country has entered a team in each of FIFA's and CAF's competitions, from under-17 to national team level, and also for the women's team. In the short space of six years, SAFA has achieved remarkable success with qualification for the World Cup finals in France in 1998, the title of African champions at the 1996 African Nations Cup finals, which the country hosted, and the runners-up berth in Burkina Faso two years later. At under-20 level, South Africa were runners- up at the 1997 African Youth Championship in Morocco and qualified to play at the 1997 FIFA World Youth Championship in Malaysia. At club level, Orlando Pirates won the prestigious African Champions Cup in 1995, the first club from the southern African region to take the title in more than 30 years of competition. Pirates were playing in the event for the first time and won the title away from home in the Ivory Coast to further amplify the magnificence of the victory. Behind the scenes, SAFA has worked long and hard to provide the structures to take football to all levels of the South African community. There are now national age-group competitions from under-12 level up, qualified coaches working around the country and nine provincial affiliates, who are further divided into 52 regions.

Bumble (Olivier B. Bommel in Dutch) is a fictional anthropomorphic bear, one of the two main characters in a Dutch comic book series written by Marten Toonder. The other is Tom Puss (Tom Poes), and the comic book bears the name of either of these characters. Publication history The first Tom Puss stories were told as illustrated novels, published in daily installments in the Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf. Tom Puss first appeared as a replacement for the Mickey Mouse strip in 1941. It was not until later that Tom Puss became more identifiable as a comic strip. Sir Oliver B. Bumble was introduced in 1941, in the third Tom Puss story. Initially, he was only a supporting character, but he soon became a second protagonist. As Tom Puss was noble and heroic, later stories came to depend on the flawed and kind-hearted Oliver B. Bumble as an initiator of events. The final story, published in 1986, ends the story with Bumble marrying his neighbor, Miss Doddel, and settling down. There have been over 600 Tom Puss stories in total and most of them feature Oliver B. Bumble. Bumble and Puss' stories have been translated and published worldwide. An animated movie based on the series named Als je begrijpt wat ik bedoel (\\"If you know what I mean,\\" one of Bumble's catch-phrases) was released in 1983. In English, it is alternately called The Dragon That Wasn't (Or Was He?) and Dexter the Dragon and Bumble the Bear. In the 1940s, Toonder created a number of short animated movies featuring the characters in commercials for Philips. In February 2007, the Dutch Programme Foundation began a 440-part radio drama based on the series, hosted by Radio 4. The series ended in December 2009. There have been rumors of a new film and animation series. Character Sir Oliver is a bear of nobility; an eloquent, though not always coherent, gentleman with a slight stutter when he's upset. He enjoys the finer things in life, like a good pipe, and tries to make a good impression with his peers in the \\"Kleine Club,\\" the \\"Little Club\\", a rather exclusive affair. It includes members such as mayor Dickerdack, overly eager to delegate difficult tasks, and Bumble's arch-rival the Marquis de Canteclaer, who is also his neighbor and thinks that \\"this, err.. Bumble\\" is a parvenu. Bumble's membership is somewhat controversial and he's blackballed on several occasions. Bumble is quite wealthy; he even makes it into the upper ten who own almost everything,De Bovenbazen but always tells others that money is of no importance and is generous to his friends and those in need. He lives in castle , where his butler Joost sees to his every need. He is a modest bear though; he always dresses in a simple checkered coat and his car, nicknamed \\"De Oude Schicht\\" https://www.lambiek.net/artists/t/toonder.htm (\\"The Old Bolt (of lightning)\\"), is reliable, but not extravagant. Extravagance is a trait Bumble doesn't possess, following his dear father'sHis father does not appear within the stories, but is often referred to: \\"As my good father said: '...'\\" lessons of modesty and common sense, exemplified in a \\"simple yet nutritious meal\\", which is rarely simple but always nutritious. The phrase \\"een eenvoudig doch voedzaam maal\\" has become a colloquialism in Dutch. He is a kind soul but he tends to act before he thinks. https://www.lambiek.net/artists/t/toonder.htm His compassion and sense of justice can sometimes move him to do great things,e.g. De Slijtmijten, De Sloven although it's usually others, most often Joost and Tom Puss, who do the actual work. He also tends to blame others for his own mistakes and rarely gives Tom Puss the credit he deserves for getting him out of trouble. As he has a \\"delicate constitution\\",\\"een teer gestel\\" he has no heart for conflict, but in the end he will always help his friends in need. Bumble has two staunch admirers. The first is Miss Doddle, Bumble's Dulcinea and his prime source of fresh tea, courage and resolve in times of great emotional turmoil. She idolizes Bumble and thinks he's the smartest man in the world, even though Bumble is out of his depth more often than not. The second great admirer is the dwarf Kwetal who thinks Bumble has a big thinking- frame (\\"denkraam\\") and blindly trusts his judgment. He is the source of some weird gadgets which wreak havoc in Bumble's life or work as a deus ex machina to solve the problems which Bumble's ill-conceived grand designs have caused. Although Bumble has many flaws in his character, and maybe because of it, he's far more popular than Tom Puss and practically reduced the former hero to a sidekick.https://www.lambiek.net/artists/t/toonder.htm In many ways Bumble is an antihero, blundering blindly through life, forced by fate, one of several villains or Dorknoper, civil servant first class and tax-collector, to make decisions which greatly influence his world. Hence he is a more interesting figure than Tom Puss, who is a bit boring in contrast. Clarifications The claim that the B. in Olivier B. Bommel would stand for Berendinus is semi- canonical at best. A middle name is not found in any of the original stories and ‚Äîaccording to the author‚Äî did not exist. Bommel was intended to be an American, though it is possible that he did indeed return to ancestral grounds. The lone initial was part of the American attributes of the character. The source of Berendinus was the answer by an editor in the Tom Poes magazine, and thus one given with a semblance of authority, which explains the popularity of the claim. Related to this is the play in the original series with the meanings of the Dutch word heer, which does mean gentleman, though it does not mean member of the nobility, which Bumble as American would not be. He is very rich and tries to live like a gentleman. Another meaning is lord, as in (absolute) ruler; as owner of his castle, he turns out to have been the lord of the land for almost the entire series in the last story. \\"Sir\\" rather obscures this essential part of the character as it rather suggests some noble title under lordship. An acceptable translation might be Oliver Bommel Esq. Catch phrases Oliver B. Bumble uses several catch phrases: * \\"If you know what I mean\\", usually used at the end of nearly any speech he made. * \\"Like my dear father always said: ..... and I abide by that.\\" * \\"Money is of no consequence\\"  References  External links *Toon\\"der\\"tijd A Dutch site for collectors of Olivier B.

Muldoon (May 25, 1852 - June 3, 1933)New York Times, June 4 1933 WILLIAM MULDOON DIES IN SLEEP AT 88 was the Greco-Roman Wrestling Champion, a physical culturist and the first chairman of the New York State Athletic Commission. He once wrestled a match that lasted over seven hours. Nicknamed \\"The Solid Man,\\"\\"The Solid Man\\" nickname was referenced from a popular song of the time, \\"Muldoon, the Solid Man\\" by Edward (\\"Ned\\") Harrigan. The moniker may have also been a nod to the \\"Solid Muldoon\\", a P.T. Barnum exhibit claimed to be the petrified remains of an ancestral missing link between man and ape, later revealed as a hoax. Muldoon established himself as champion in Greco- Roman wrestling in the 1880s and over the years gained a remarkable measure of public influence that would continue through his days as a health farm proprietor in Westchester County and his service on NYSAC. Muldoon was a mainstay in New York sports for over 50 years. Early life Born in Allegany County, New York, Muldoon was the son of Irish immigrants. His father was a farmer. Showing a knack for strength athletics at a young age, Muldoon gained a local reputation as a standout in caber-tossing, weightlifting, sprinting and amateur wrestling. His youth was otherwise characterized by a brutish, flash temper, and his desire to be treated with the respect of an adult despite being a child. Muldoon journeyed to Paris to serve as a volunteer in the French Army in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71, where he met publisher James Gordon Bennett, Jr., who told Muldoon he had the potential to be the best Greco-Roman wrestler in the world if he concentrated on it.According to Ring Magazine publisher Nat Fleischer in his volume, \\"From Milo to Londos\\" (The Ring Athletic Library, Book No. 13, 1936) By 1876, Muldoon was living in New York City, where he accepted appointment to the New York Police Department at the behest of Senator John Morrissey, former bare-knuckle boxing champion. At the time of his resignation in 1881 Muldoon was a detective. The Solid Man In 1880, Muldoon gained recognition as World's Greco-Roman Champion with a win over title claimant Thiebaud Bauer. His rise to prominence brought challengers from across the globe, including Edwin Bibby and Tom Cannon of England, Donald Dinnie of Scotland, \\"Mat\\" Sorakichi of Japan, Carl Abs of Germany, William Miller of Australia, and John McMahon and Clarence Whistler, the latter being Muldoon's opponent in a titanic seven-hour match in 1881, where neither could gain a single fall.Whistler, who died young, was later eulogized by Muldoon as the toughest man he ever met on the mat. Their 1881 match ignited a professional and personal rivalry that punctuated wrestling's popularity in the early to mid-1880s. Following the celebrated match with Whistler, Muldoon assembled an athletic combination and toured the country promoting athletic events and defending his title against all comers. Muldoon became involved in theater around this time, stemming from his fame in athletics. In 1883 he shared the bill with Maurice Barrymore, a boxer turned actor, in Madame Modjeska's production of Shakespeare's \\"As You Like It.\\" Barrymore played Orlando and Muldoon was Charles the Wrestler. In 1887, he appeared on Broadway as \\"The Fighting Gaul\\" in \\"Spartacus.\\" Muldoon was one of a party of gentlemen entertained by Robert Emmet Odlum, brother of women's rights activist Charlotte Odlum Smith, on the morning of May 19, 1885, the day he jumped from the Brooklyn Bridge and was killed. Muldoon assisted in unsuccessful resuscitation efforts and summoned an ambulance, which was too late to save Odlum. An 1887 \\"Allen & Ginter\\" tobacco card depicting Muldoon In 1889 Muldoon trained John L. Sullivan for his famous 75-round fight against Jake Kilrain for the world heavyweight bare-knuckle boxing championship. He had done so on a friendly wager and offered to absorb expenses if Sullivan lost. Sullivan won and Muldoon gained national notice for restoring the boxing champion to fighting form. Muldoon's methods at accomplishing Sullivan's rejuvenation gained much public interest. On May 28, Muldoon and Sullivan would have an exhibition wrestling bout contested under London Prize Ring Rules that ended on a 5-5 draw. The two would later have a 3 round bout where Muldoon would win two of three boutshttps://www.bloodyelbow.com/2012/6/27/3048631/martial-chronicles-Junior- Dos-Santos-cm-punk-Mike-Tyson-baddest-man Muldoon was never defeated for his Greco-Roman Championship. He wrestled in his final championship match in 1890, defeating Evan Lewis in Philadelphia. Despite being implored by promoters and challengers to come out of retirement, Muldoon never wrestled another finish match or claimed any active championship. He symbolically passed his World's Greco-Roman Championship to prot√©g√© Ernest Roeber (whom Lewis later defeated). Muldoon would make his final public appearance as a wrestler in a charity exhibition match against Roeber at Madison Square Garden in 1894. That same year Muldoon moved his health farm from Belfast, New York to White Plains. As he tapered off direct involvement in professional athletics he devoted more time to devising his system on restoring one's health. Muldoon continued to train boxers and wrestlers until boxing was banned in New York at the turn of the century. Later years In 1900, Muldoon opened what would become the work of his life, the well-known health institute \\"The Olympia,\\" at Purchase, New York. In subsequent years through the success of the Olympia Muldoon would again gain national notice as he treated such notables there as U.S. Ambassador to Great Britain Joseph Hodges Choate, publisher Ralph Pulitzer, Senator Chauncey Depew, Major General J. Franklin Bell, essayist Elbert Hubbard novelist Theodore Dreiser and Secretary of State Elihu Root, who was sent to Muldoon by President Roosevelt. In 1907 there was talk that Muldoon would be appointed to the president's cabinet to oversee physical health. For his uncompromised methods at his health farm Muldoon was dubbed the \\"Professor.\\" Journalist Nellie Bly was the first woman to complete Muldoon's system. In the spring of 1909 Muldoon made a final return to the stage in a theatrical tour organized in benefit of The Lambs. Muldoon dedicated a Civil War monument to the town of Belfast, New York, listing the names of local veterans in 1915, including that of his older brother John. at www.usgennet.org The mausoleum of William Muldoon in Kensico Cemetery In 1921 Muldoon was personally tapped by Governor Nathan Lewis Miller as the inaugural Chairman of the New York State Athletic Commission, when professional boxing's status was legally restored in New York. While on NYSAC, Muldoon's czarish decrees characterized his inflexible sense of integrity to the press and sporting public. He was dubbed in the papers the \\"Iron Duke.\\" In 1927 Muldoon was profiled by \\"The New Yorker\\" magazine and in 1929 by \\"The Saturday Evening Post\\". A biography was published in 1928, with a foreword by Jack Dempsey.Van Every, Edward. Muldoon ‚Äì The Solid Man of Sport. New York: Frederick A. Stokes Company, 1928. William Muldoon died at age 81 in Westchester County, New York, and was interred in a grandiose private mausoleum at Kensico Cemetery in Valhalla, New York. Sometime after the end of his wrestling career and before the turn of the century, Muldoon had mendaciously claimed for years that he was born in 1845, and 7 years older than his age verified in the Muldoon Family Bible, which documents his real birth year. In 1996, Muldoon was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame. In 2004, he was inducted into the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum under the \\"Pioneer Era\\" category. Personal Muldoon claimed to be a lifelong bachelor. However, he was married twice; the first marriage ended in divorce, the other in separation. His housekeeper of 30 years Leonie Lutringer left her entire estate to Muldoon in 1922. It was revealed later in his life that he had adopted his longtime secretary Margaret Farrell - she received his entire estate at his death. Muldoon was diagnosed with terminal cancer in 1931, though his doctors did not reveal the nature of his illness to him. Muldoon died two years later. Retired boxing champion Gene Tunney, a disciple of Muldoon, remarked to the Times at the time of Muldoon's death, \\"All I know about training I learned from him‚Ä¶. His patience, intellectual courage and wisdom were inspirational.\\" William Muldoon was interred at Kensico Cemetery, Valhalla, NY. Muldoon was a strong advocate of compulsory military service, equestrianism, physical culture and the Boy Scouts of America, citing the latter as the only organization left devoted to leadership-building for young men.

He was a Progressive Conservative member in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1975 to 1990, and was a cabinet minister in the governments of Bill Davis and Frank Miller. Background McCague was born in Essa Township, north of Alliston, Ontario. He was son of J. J. E. McCague, who owned Glenafton Farms which was one of the best known dairy farms of its time. He was educated at Burns Public School, Alliston High School (both schools since closed) and the Ontario Agricultural College in Guelph, Ontario. He worked as a sod and potato farmer and executive and owned a real estate company in Alliston. Politics McCague was a councillor in Alliston from 1960 to 1961, deputy reeve from 1962 to 1964, reeve from 1965 to 1966, a public school board member from 1967 to 1968 and Mayor from 1969 to 1973. He was chair of the Board of Governors for Georgian College from 1967 to 1974 and Simcoe County warden in 1966. He also served as chair of the Niagara Escarpment Commission in the early 1970s. He was elected to the Ontario legislature in the 1975 provincial election, after defeating long serving Dufferin Simcoe MP Wally Downer for the Progressive Conservative nomination. He defeated Liberal Bob Beattie by 1,691 votes in the riding of Dufferin‚ÄîSimcoe. He was elected by greater margins in the elections of 1977, 1981, and 1985. McCague served as parliamentary assistant to the Treasurer just before the 1977 election, and was brought into Bill Davis's cabinet on September 21, 1977 as Minister of Government Services. On January 21, 1978, he was shifted to the Ministry of the Environment. He was named Chair of the Management Board of Cabinet on August 18, 1978. He retained this position until Davis resigned as Premier in 1985. McCague tried to convince Davis to remain in office for another election, but afterwards endorsed Frank Miller to succeed him as party leader. When Miller replaced Davis as Premier on February 8, 1985, he appointed McCague as Minister of Transportation and Communications. Soon after this, the Tories were reduced to a tenuous minority government in the 1985 election under Miller's leadership. McCague was retained in his portfolio after the election, but did little of significance before the government was defeated in the house. He sat in opposition for the remainder of his time in the legislature. McCague was narrowly re-elected in the 1987 election, defeating Liberal candidate Gary Johnson by only 306 votes in the redistributed constituency of Simcoe West. He did not seek re-election in 1990. He returned to municipal politics, and served as mayor of Tecumseth from 1992 to 1994. McCague is considered a mentor to his successor in the legislature, former cabinet minister Jim Wilson. He continued to support the federal Progressive Conservative Party over the Reform Party in the 1990s. After leaving provincial politics, McCague served as the Mayor of the newly amalgamated town of New Tecumseth from 1992 to 1994. Shortly after Mike Harris returned the Progressive Conservatives to government in 1995, McCague was appointed as a government negotiator in talks with the Ontario Medical Association. He was a founding member, and first Chair, of the Board Governors of Georgian College, in Barrie. =Cabinet positions= References External links * Category:1929 births Category:2014 deaths Category:Members of the Executive Council of Ontario Category:Ontario Agricultural College alumni Category:Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario MPPs ","title":"George McCague"},{"id":"1897149","text":"Miros≈Çaw Szymkowiak () (born 12 November 1976) is a Polish former professional footballer who played as a playmaker.

The two segments, although not directly connected, are linked by U.S. Route 3, from which they derive their route number. Route description =Southern segment= The southern terminus of the southern segment is at the Massachusetts state line in Hudson, where it continues south as Massachusetts Route 3A. The northern terminus is in the city of Concord at US 3. This segment of NH 3A follows the Merrimack River for its entire length. The route begins in Hudson at the Massachusetts line and shortly intersects the eastern end of the Nashua Circumferential Highway, which provides access to US 3 and the F.E. Everett Turnpike. NH 3A passes through Hudson Village, the historic center of town, where it intersects with NH 111 just across the river from downtown Nashua. NH 102 begins at this intersection and is cosigned with NH 3A for its first mile, before 3A splits to the north west, while 102 continues on towards Londonderry. NH 3A continues along the eastern bank of the river, through Litchfield and into the city of Manchester, where it crosses under I-293/NH 101 and follows a short surface alignment in the southwest section of town. NH 3A intersects with US 3 and is actually cosigned with it (in a wrong- way concurrency) on Queen City Avenue across the river, where the two routes intersect NH 114A at its eastern terminus. At this point, NH 3A leaves US 3 and merges onto I-293 northbound (which also carries the Everett Turnpike) at exit 4. NH 3A is concurrent with I-293 for , departing at exit 7 and crossing into Hooksett. The highway immediately interchanges with I-93 (which it parallels for the remainder of its length) near the northern terminus of I-293, and continues north (now paralleling on the west side of the river). Hackett Hill Road provides another access point to I-93, while nearby Main Street connects to US 3/NH 28 across the river. NH 3A enters Bow and meets the southern end of the I-89 freeway before crossing into the city limits of Concord. The highway interchanges with I-93 one last time before ending at US 3 just south of downtown Concord. =Northern segment= The southern terminus of the northern segment is in the city of Franklin at US 3, NH 11, and NH 127. Where US 3 takes a more easterly route from here, NH 3A continues due north, following the western bank of the Pemigewasset River along North Main Street. North of Franklin, it enters the town of Hill, continuing to follow the Pemigewasset, passing through the William H. Thomas State Forest on the way to the town of Bristol. It forms the main commercial thoroughfare through Bristol, with a brief concurrency with NH 104 in the center of town, following first South Main Street, then Pleasant Street, and finally Lake Street. At Bristol, 3A leaves the Pemigewasset, which turns east here, and continues north into Bridgewater and the southern shores of Newfound Lake. Following the Mayhew Turnpike along the eastern side of Newfound Lake through Bridgewater, 3A continues through rural areas on the eastern side of Hebron and the western side of Plymouth. In Plymouth, the route joins with NH 25 and heads due east to rejoin US 3 at an interchange with Interstate 93, US 3 and NH 25, which is the northern terminus of this segment. History left NH 3A in the town of Bow From 1922 to 1926, Route 3A was part of the New England road marking system as New England Route 6A (NE-6A). In 1926, all roads designated as NE-6A were changed to New Hampshire Route 3A and Massachusetts Route 3A to accommodate the change of New England Route 6 to U.S. Route 3.

G. Wodehouse, and features the young gentleman Bertie Wooster and his valet Jeeves. The story was published in the Saturday Evening Post in the United States in November 1916, and in The Strand Magazine in the United Kingdom in April 1923. The story was also included in the 1925 collection Carry On, Jeeves.Cawthorne (2013), p. 47. Bertie meets Jeeves for the first time in this story. Florence Craye, Bertie's fianc√©e, wants him to destroy his uncle's scandalous memoirs. Plot 24-year-old Bertie Wooster returns to London from Easeby, his Uncle Willoughby's home, after firing his valet for stealing. An agency sends him Jeeves, who prepares a drink that cures both Bertie's hangover and his fatigue after trying to read a difficult book titled \\"Types of Ethical Theory\\", which his fianc√©e, Lady Florence Craye, expects him to read. Impressed, Bertie hires Jeeves. Bertie receives a telegram from Florence, who is at Easeby, telling him to return at once. Jeeves wants Bertie to wear a simple brown or blue suit with a hint of quiet twill, but Bertie wears his check suit instead. At Easeby, Florence tells Bertie that his uncle is writing a memoir called \\"Recollections of a Long Life\\". Many of the stories feature Florence's father, Lord Worplesdon. Florence is appalled by the rowdy stories. She tells Bertie to destroy the manuscript. Bertie does not want to upset his uncle, upon whom he is financially dependent, but Florence is adamant. Bertie steals the parcel, and after running into Florence's young brother Edwin, Bertie locks it in a drawer in his room. Uncle Willoughby tells Bertie that his publishers have not received his manuscript. He fears it has been stolen. Feeling guilty, Bertie tries to take a walk, but overhears Edwin telling Willoughby that he saw Bertie hiding a parcel. Bertie rushes back to his room to move the parcel but finds he has misplaced the key to the locked drawer. Willoughby arrives, and searches. When he reaches the locked drawer, Jeeves appears and provides the key. At first Bertie is angry with Jeeves, but the drawer is empty. After Willoughby leaves, Bertie thanks Jeeves, who moved the parcel. Later, Willoughby reports that his publishers received his manuscript. Florence is furious with Bertie and ends their engagement. Distressed, Bertie questions Jeeves, who admits sending the parcel to the publishers. He says Florence overestimated the offensiveness of Sir Willoughby's \\"Recollections\\". When Jeeves shows no sympathy about the broken engagement, Bertie fires him. Jeeves opines that Bertie would not have been happy with Florence. After sleeping on it, Bertie realizes that Jeeves is right. He rehires Jeeves and allows Jeeves to dispose of the check suit. Jeeves thanks him and says he has already given the suit away to the under-gardener. Style Characters in Wodehouse's stories rarely tell conventional jokes, and humour is instead created indirectly through a number of stylistic devices. Bertie Wooster seldom tells a traditional joke, for example, but often uses puns, such as when he describes how his valet Meadowes stole his socks: \\"I was reluctantly compelled to hand the misguided blighter the mitten\\", and, \\"directly I found that he was a sock-sneaker I gave him the boot\\".Thompson (1992), p. 277. In Wodehouse's stories, information is frequently repeated in two or more ways through the use of alternative words, placing concentration on humorous language rather than on a steady flow of new narrative information. For instance, pairs of synonymous words are often used in Bertie's narration and dialogue, as in the following quote from this story: \\"This infernal kid must somehow be turned out eftsoons or right speedily\\".Thompson (1992), p. 321. Publication history 1923 Strand illustration by A. Wallis Mills Henry Raleigh provided illustrations for the 1916 publication of the story in the Saturday Evening Post.McIlvaine (1990), p. 156, D59.30. The story was illustrated by A. Wallis Mills in the Strand.McIlvaine (1990), p. 184, D133.92. In 1980, the story was reprinted in the Saturday Evening Post with illustrations by Phil Smith.McIlvaine (1990), pp. 158‚Äì159, D59.150-D59.151. The story was included in the American edition of the 1939 Wodehouse collection The Week-End Wodehouse, and in the 1958 collection of Wodehouse stories, Selected Stories by P. G. Wodehouse.McIlvaine (1990), pp. 116‚Äì117, B6a, and p. 120, B11a. Adaptations The first part of the story, in which Bertie hires Jeeves, was adapted into the Jeeves and Wooster episode \\"Jeeves' Arrival\\", the first episode of the first series, which first aired in the UK on 22 April 1990. The rest of the story, concerning Florence and scandalous memoirs, was adapted into \\"Sir Watkyn Bassett's Memoirs\\", the fifth episode of the fourth series, which first aired in the UK on 26 April 1992. There are some differences in plot, including: * In \\"Jeeves' Arrival\\", Jeeves refuses to tell Bertie the ingredients of his preparation, though he names three ingredients in the original story. * Florence is Sir Watkyn Bassett's niece and Madeline Bassett's cousin in the episode, though this was never stated in the original canon. * The memoirs belong to Sir Watkyn Bassett; Bertie's Uncle Willoughby does not appear in the episode. In addition to Florence, Madeline also tells Bertie to steal the manuscript. * Bertie finds Spode trying to steal the manuscript, which contains stories about him that could ruin his political career. At Bassett's behest, Constable Oates uses dynamite to open the safe, and Bassett removes the manuscript and packages it. Then Bertie steals the parcel. * Edwin is not in the episode; it is Gussie Fink-Nottle who says that he saw Bertie with a parcel. * Jeeves does not wait until he has been fired to voice his opinion about Florence; before Bertie can fire Jeeves, Bertie overhears Florence being hard on some servants, and decides immediately that Jeeves was right about her. Only afterward does Jeeves talk about how Florence overestimated the dangers of the manuscript as he and Bertie walk off.

In sailing, hiking (stacking or stacking out in New Zealand; leaning out or sitting out in United Kingdom) is the action of moving the crew's body weight as far to windward (upwind) as possible, in order to decrease the extent the boat heels (leans away from the wind). By moving the crew's weight to windward, the moment of that force around the boat's center of buoyancy is increased. This opposes the heeling moment of the wind pushing sideways against the boat's sails. It is usually done by leaning over the edge of the boat as it heels. Some boats are fitted with equipment such as hiking straps (or toe straps) and trapezes to make hiking more effective. Hiking is most integral to catamaran and dinghy sailing, where the lightweight boat can be easily capsized or turtled by the wind unless the sailor counteracts the wind's pressure by hiking, or eases the sails to reduce it. The heavy keel on larger keelboats means that it is rare to capsize them due to wind alone, but keelboat racers will still hike to prevent unnecessary heeling, or leaning sideways to leeward, because the more vertical in the water the keel is, the more effective it is at keeping the boat moving in a forward direction and preventing it from drifting to leeward, slowing the boat due to drag, and potentially increasing the distance the boat must sail when beating. Improper heel creates a tendency for the boat to turn off course, necessitating a correction with the rudder, which also increases drag. Sails use wind most efficiently when they are at a proper heel, another reason for controlling heel. Hiking equipment Many boats, especially dinghies, have equipment that facilitates effective hiking. Hiking straps (toe straps) made from rope or webbing hold the sailor's feet down, allowing them to lean back over the gunwale of the boat while sitting facing in. These simple devices are almost universal on dinghies that do not have more complex hiking systems. Some sailors wear special shorts fitted with pads or stiff battens to help them hike more effectively and without tiring. Some dinghies and catamarans, such as the 505, 420, International 14, or Hobie 16, have a trapeze to allow the crew to increase their righting moment on the boat. These are wires attached high up on the mast, and fitted with a bracket that fits into a hook on a harness worn by the crew. This wire and harness then supports the crew as they stand and lean back over the water, pulling against the mast. On some boats, such as the Laser 2, the skipper uses hiking straps, and the crew uses a trapeze. On high-performance skiffs, such as the International 14 or 49er, both the skipper and the crew use trapezes. Hiking boards are long boards fitted perpendicular to the boat's hull, and sometimes stretching several feet over the water. These allow the crew to move their weight far out to windward. They are commonly designed to slide from side to side, so they are moved to the windward side whenever the boat tacks. They are most often used on sailing canoes, but can be installed on many kinds of dinghy. there are also two racing classes that use planks and they are the VJ, and the bigger Skate (dinghy). Some racing keelboats are fitted with elastic lifelines running down the sides of the boat. These allow the crew to lean into the lifeline to get further out on the windward rail. Many kinds of racing keelboat are raced with more crew aboard than is strictly necessary to operate the boat in order to increase the amount of weight on the upwind side of the boat, keeping the boat flatter. A few high performance keelboats, such as the Moore 30 and the Kiwi 35, have structural hiking \\"wings\\" built into their hull, which allows a lower displacement hull and increased leverage for hiking. including a picture of the turtled WingNuts See Turtling. On most dinghies the tiller is fitted with a tiller extension or hiking stick, which allows the skipper to steer the boat while hiked out.

Sampson was a journalist and a member of EOKA, which rose against the British colonial administration, seeking Enosis (Union) of the island of Cyprus with Greece. He was eventually arrested and sentenced to death, but was imprisoned in Britain after the sentence was commuted, returning after Cyprus gained independence. Upon his arrival within the newly-formed Republic of Cyprus, he entered politics, becoming a member of Parliament. Following the coup of 1974 by the Greek Junta, he was appointed President by the leaders of the coup Kombokis and Georgitsis as a solution of necessity because nobody else accepted, and remained in the position for eight days. Following the Turkish invasion of Cyprus on 20 July he resigned. He was later sentenced to twenty years in prison for abuse of power, the only person convicted vis-√†-vis the coup, maintaining there had been a setup and cover up. According to Cyprus-based Polish-American journalist, Andrew Borowiec, several members of the US embassy in Nicosia had been on friendly terms with Sampson and he had even toured the USA at the US government's invitation. Three years into his sentence, he was allowed to go to France on medical grounds, and subsequently settled in France. He returned to Cyprus in 1990 to resume his sentence, and was pardoned for the remainder of his sentence in 1993. Following his release, he went into the newspaper publishing business. He died of cancer in 2001. Early life Sampson was born in the Cypriot port city of Famagusta to Sampson Georgiadis and Theano Liasidou. During his teenage years, he was a footballer, playing as a right back in the Anorthosis Famagusta second team. He began his working life at a Cyprus newspaper, The Cyprus Times, which was owned and edited by Charles Foley. His original name was Nikos Georgiadis, but he adopted his father's forename as his surname. EOKA activities During the Cyprus Emergency, in which the EOKA guerrilla group waged a campaign of resistance to British colonial rule in Cyprus from 1955 to 1959, Sampson joined EOKA and adopted the nom de guerre Atrotos (), or \\"Invulnerable\\". Sampson joined EOKA and formed part of an execution team under the direct orders of General Georgios Grivas (\\"Digenis\\"), leader of EOKA. Another member of this team was Neoptolemos Georgiou who was later arrested for various activities whilst being a member of EOKA-B. Sampson and Georgiou participated in a number of murders carried out along Ledra Street in Nicosia, which was nicknamed \\"Murder Mile\\", and shot dead numerous British servicemen, police officers, and civilians.BRITAIN'S MOST WANTED He was involved in at least 15 killings. According to British sources, the actual number was much higher.http://www.economist.com/node/623907 Among his victims were three police sergeants, and in May 1957, Sampson was tried for one of their murders. He confessed, but was acquitted on the grounds that his confession may have been coerced by torture. At the time, Sampson was working as a journalist, and he would often photograph the bodies of his victims after killing them, then send the photographs to The Cyprus Times newspaper to be published. The police became suspicious about how Sampson was always the first reporter to arrive at the murder scene and he was arrested. Only a month after his acquittal, he was given away by informants and arrested in the village of Dhali. He was convicted of weapons possession which, under the emergency regulations of the moment, carried a death sentence. The death sentence was subsequently commuted to life imprisonment and Sampson was flown to the United Kingdom to serve it. A year and a half later, under a general amnesty as part of the 1959 Z√ºrich and London Agreement, he was released but he remained in exile in Greece until Cyprus gained formal independence in August 1960. He returned to Nicosia shortly after Independence Day. The 1960s Sampson returned to newspaper publishing. In 1960, he set up the newspaper Makhi (), meaning battle, or struggle, which was one of the first Greek newspapers in circulation in the nation of Cyprus. In 1961, in a series of newspaper articles, he admitted his service fighting the occupying police officers in 1956 during the resistance campaign against British rule of the Greek island of Cyprus. According to the Telegraph, as a journalist, he flew to Algeria to interview Ben Bella and to Washington to talk to US President John F. Kennedy. On 14 May 1961, he was arrested, along with another man, a garage mechanic who was also a former EOKA member, in connection with the murder of a British architect, Peter Gray, who had been only three weeks in the country and had been shot and killed in Kyrenia in his car. Sampson was charged with the murder, but released three days later. Makhi later printed a claim that Gray was working for the British Secret Intelligence Service. His murder remained unsolved. Following an explosion to the statue of EOKA hero Markos Drakos in Nicosia, Sampson actively participated in clashes between the Greek and Turkish communities in December 1963. On the morning of 24 December, the clashes in Nicosia spread and fighting continued into the subsequent year. Sampson led armed groups in fierce battles between Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot irregulars. Following the fight in Omorphita, Nikos Sampson was nicknamed by the Turkish Cypriots as the \\"Butcher of Omorphita\\".S. Akhtar Ali.

In 1971, EOKA head George Grivas returned to Cyprus and gave the campaign for enosis further momentum, forming EOKA B whose goal was enosis. Following the death of Grivas in January 1974, the Greek military junta of 1967-1974 gave active support to EOKA-B. Nikos Sampson maintained a strongly nationalist, pro-Greek position throughout these years. On 15 July 1974, Makarios was deposed by a military coup which was led by Greek officers of the Cyprus National Guard. =Interim President of Cyprus= The Greek military junta installed Sampson as President, as a result of a decision of Colonel Constantinos Kombokis, Deputy leader of the coup, when the President of the Supreme Court could not be found and an ex Makarios minister Zenon Severis refused to take over as President. Sampson's appointment was an on-the-spot decision to avoid a power vacuum. The second Junta of Greece fell on 24 July 1974, only eight days after Sampson had been appointed. Sampson was forced to resign. The Greek Cypriot government was restored under Glafkos Clerides. When Sampson resigned on Tuesday July 23, 1974 Turkey was in control of 3% of the territory of Cyprus and the Turkish Cypriot enclaves (around 4-5% of the territory) had almost all fallen in the hands of Greek-Cypriots (H Tragiki Anametrisi kai i Prodosia tis Kyprou-Marios Adamides ‚Äì 2012). Imprisonment and later years The invasion lost Sampson much of his popular appeal. He claimed not to have anticipated the impending coup that had installed him, adding that, after military officers had insisted, he \\"saw the possibility of civil war and accepted\\" to prevent the clashes. Nonetheless, Sampson was prosecuted and sentenced to 20 years in prison for abuse of power () in 1976. In 1979, only three years into his prison sentence, he was allowed to go to France on medical grounds. Living in Neuilly, and then in Fourqueux, he was supported by funds of friends. He spent much of his time between Paris and Marseilles before returning to Cyprus in June 1990 to complete his sentence. Following his release from Nicosia Central Prison in 1993, he went back to the newspaper publishing business. He died of cancer on 10 May 2001 in Nicosia at the age of 65. He is survived by his wife Vera and two children, one of whom is a lawyer and the other a journalist. His son Sotiris Sampson was elected member of the House of Representatives of Cyprus for three terms in a row in Famagusta District. Legacy The right wing community refers to Sampson as a hero of the EOKA struggle, whereas the left wing community, although it acknowledges his contribution to the EOKA struggle, sees him as a traitor to the Republic of Cyprus for his involvement in the coup and complicity in the murder of numerous liberal and left-wing Greek Cypriots.

It is co-sponsored by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (part of the office of the Director of National Intelligence), and began in 1992 as part of the TIPSTER Text program. Its purpose is to support and encourage research within the information retrieval community by providing the infrastructure necessary for large-scale evaluation of text retrieval methodologies and to increase the speed of lab-to-product transfer of technology. Each track has a challenge wherein NIST provides participating groups with data sets and test problems. Depending on track, test problems might be questions, topics, or target extractable features. Uniform scoring is performed so the systems can be fairly evaluated. After evaluation of the results, a workshop provides a place for participants to collect together thoughts and ideas and present current and future research work.Text Retrieval Conference started in 1992, funded by DARPA (US Defense Advanced Research Project) and Run by NIST. Its purpose was to support research within the information retrieval community by providing the infrastructure necessary for large-scale evaluation of text retrieval methodologies. Goals * Encourage retrieval search based on large text collections * Increase communication among industry ,academia, and government by creating an open forum for the exchange of research ideas * Speed the transfer of technology from research labs into commercial products by demonstrating substantial improvements retrieval methodologies on real world problems * To increase the availability of appropriate evaluation techniques for use by industry and academia including development of new evaluation techniques more applicable to current systems TREC is overseen by a program committee consisting of representatives from government, industry, and academia. For each TREC, NIST provide a set of documents and questions. Participants run their own retrieval system on the data and return to NIST a list of retrieved top-ranked documents .NIST pools the individual result judges the retrieved documents for correctness and evaluates the results. The TREC cycle ends with a workshop that is a forum for participants to share their experiences. Relevance judgments in TREC TREC uses binary relevance criterion that is either the document is relevant or not relevant. Since size of TREC collection is large, it is impossible to calculate the absolute recall for each query. In order to assess the relevance of documents in relation to a query, TREC uses a specific method call pooling for calculating relative recall. All the relevant documents that occurred in the top 100 documents for each system and for each query are combined together to produce a pool of relevant documents. Recall being the proportion of the pool of relevant documents that a single system retrieved for a query topic. Various TRECs In 1992 TREC-1 was held at NIST. The first conference attracted 28 groups of researchers from academia and industry. It demonstrated a wide range of different approaches to the retrieval of text from large document collections .Finally TREC1 revealed the facts that automatic construction of queries from natural language query statements seems to work. Techniques based on natural language processing were no better no worse than those based on vector or probabilistic approach. TREC2 Took place in august 1993. 31 group of researchers where participated in this. Two types of retrieval were examined. Retrieval using an ‚Äòad hoc‚Äôquery and retrieval using a ‚Äòrouting query. In TREC-3 a small group experiments worked with Spanish language collection and others dealt with interactive query formulation in multiple databases. TREC-4 they made even shorter to investigate the problems with very short user statements TREC-5 includes both short and long versions of the topics with the goal of carrying out deeper investigation into which types of techniques work well on various lengths of topics. In TREC-6 Three new tracks speech, cross language, high precision information retrieval were introduced. The goal of cross language information retrieval is to facilitate research on system that are able to retrieve relevant document regardless of language of the source document. TREC-7 contained seven tracks out of which two were new Query track and very large corpus track. The goal of the query track was to create a large query collection. TREC-8 contain seven tracks out of which two ‚Äìquestion answering and web tracks were new. The objective of QA query is to explore the possibilities of providing answers to specific natural language queries TREC-9 Includes seven tracks In TREC-10 Video tracks introduced Video tracks design to promote research in content based retrieval from digital video. In TREC-11Novelity tracks introduced. The goal of novelty track is to investigate systems abilities to locate relevant and new information within the ranked set of documents returned by a traditional document retrieval system. TREC-12 held in 2003 added three new tracks Genome track, robust retrieval track, HARD (Highly Accurate Retrieval from Documents  Tracks  =Current tracks= New tracks are added as new research needs are identified, this list is current for TREC 2018.https://trec.nist.gov/tracks.html * CENTRE Track - Goal: run in parallel CLEF 2018, NTCIR-14, TREC 2018 to develop and tune an IR reproducibility evaluation protocol (new track for 2018). * Common Core Track - Goal: an ad hoc search task over news documents. * Complex Answer Retrieval (CAR) - Goal: to develop systems capable of answering complex information needs by collating information from an entire corpus. * Incident Streams Track - Goal: to research technologies to automatically process social media streams during emergency situations (new track for TREC 2018). * The News Track - Goal: partnership with The Washington Post to develop test collections in news environment (new for 2018). * Precision Medicine Track - Goal: a specialization of the Clinical Decision Support track to focus on linking oncology patient data to clinical trials. * Real-Time Summarization Track (RTS) - Goal: to explore techniques for real-time update summaries from social media streams. =Past tracks= * Chemical Track - Goal: to develop and evaluate technology for large scale search in chemistry-related documents, including academic papers and patents, to better meet the needs of professional searchers, and specifically patent searchers and chemists. * Clinical Decision Support Track - Goal: to investigate techniques for linking medical cases to information relevant for patient care * Contextual Suggestion Track - Goal: to investigate search techniques for complex information needs that are highly dependent on context and user interests. * Crowdsourcing Track - Goal: to provide a collaborative venue for exploring crowdsourcing methods both for evaluating search and for performing search tasks. * Genomics Track - Goal: to study the retrieval of genomic data, not just gene sequences but also supporting documentation such as research papers, lab reports, etc. Last ran on TREC 2007. * Dynamic Domain Track - Goal: to investigate domain-specific search algorithms that adapt to the dynamic information needs of professional users as they explore in complex domains. * Enterprise Track - Goal: to study search over the data of an organization to complete some task.

Forum for Information Retrieval Evaluation (FIRE) started in 2008 with the aim of building a South Asian counterpart for TREC, CLEF, and NTCIR,  Conference contributions to search effectiveness NIST claims that within the first six years of the workshops, the effectiveness of retrieval systems approximately doubled.From TREC homepage: \\"... effectiveness approximately doubled in the first six years of TREC\\" The conference was also the first to hold large-scale evaluations of non-English documents, speech, video and retrieval across languages. Additionally, the challenges have inspired a large body of publications. Technology first developed in TREC is now included in many of the world's commercial search engines. An independent report by RTII found that \\"about one-third of the improvement in web search engines from 1999 to 2009 is attributable to TREC. Those enhancements likely saved up to 3 billion hours of time using web search engines. ... Additionally, the report showed that for every $1 that NIST and its partners invested in TREC, at least $3.35 to $5.07 in benefits were accrued to U.S. information retrieval researchers in both the private sector and academia.\\" https://www.nist.gov/director/planning/upload/report10-1.pdf While one study suggests that the state of the art for ad hoc search did not advance substantially in the decade preceding 2009,Timothy G. Armstrong, Alistair Moffat, William Webber, Justin Zobel. Improvements that don't add up: ad hoc retrieval results since 1998. CIKM 2009. ACM. it is referring just to search for topically relevant documents in small news and web collections of a few gigabytes. There have been advances in other types of ad hoc search. For example, test collections were created for known-item web search which found improvements from the use of anchor text, title weighting and url length, which were not useful techniques on the older ad hoc test collections. In 2009, a new billion-page web collection was introduced, and spam filtering was found to be a useful technique for ad hoc web search, unlike in past test collections. The test collections developed at TREC are useful not just for (potentially) helping researchers advance the state of the art, but also for allowing developers of new (commercial) retrieval products to evaluate their effectiveness on standard tests. In the past decade, TREC has created new tests for enterprise e-mail search, genomics search, spam filtering, e-Discovery, and several other retrieval domains. TREC systems often provide a baseline for further research. Examples include: * Hal Varian, Chief Economist at Google, says Better data makes for better science. The history of information retrieval illustrates this principle well,\\" and describes TREC's contribution.Why Data Matters * TREC's Legal track has influenced the e-Discovery community both in research and in evaluation of commercial vendors.The 451 Group: Standards in e-Discovery -- walking the walk * The IBM researcher team building IBM Watson (aka DeepQA), which beat the world's best Jeopardy! players,IBM and Jeopardy!

Its southern terminus is in Winchester at the Massachusetts state line, where it continues south as Massachusetts Route 10. Administratively, the northern terminus is at a junction with U.S. Route 302 in Haverhill. In the field, however, NH 10 is cosigned along US 302 for an additional from Haverhill to an intersection with New Hampshire Route 18 in Littleton. However, this is not officially part of the route. NH 10 is a multi-state route along with Massachusetts Route 10 and Connecticut Route 10. Its number is derived from its original 1922 designation as New England Interstate Route 10. Route description = Winchester to Keene = NH 10 begins at the Massachusetts state line in Winchester, where it connects to Massachusetts Route 10. It runs northeast into the town center where it intersects with NH 78 and NH 119. NH 119 joins NH 10 briefly before splitting off to the east. NH 10 continues north along the Ashuelot River, through the town of Swanzey and into the city of Keene. NH 10 meets NH 12 and NH 101 at a traffic circle near Keene State College and turns west, joining the latter two routes to their intersection with NH 9. At this intersection, NH 101 ends while NH 10 and NH 12 turn north onto NH 9 eastbound. The three overlapped routes pass west of downtown Keene for just over , then NH 9 and NH 10 exit NH 12 at a trumpet interchange and turn northeast. NH 9 and NH 10 remain overlapped for another before NH 10 splits off to the north and crosses into the town of Gilsum. = Gilsum to Lebanon = NH 10 passes through Gilsum with no major junctions, then enters Marlow, where it has a overlap with NH 123. Continuing north, NH 10 meets the eastern terminus of NH 123A then crosses into Lempster. The highway has no major junctions in Lempster and continues north into Goshen where it intersects the northern terminus of NH 31. NH 10 continues into the town of Newport, where it shares a brief concurrency with NH 11 and NH 103 in the town center. The highway continues through Croydon with no major junctions, then into Grantham where it intersects with the northern terminus of NH 114 before interchanging with Interstate 89. NH 10 joins I-89 at exit 13 and runs along the Interstate highway for , through the southwest corner of the town of Enfield and into Lebanon, where it leaves I-89 at exit 19. = Lebanon to Haverhill = NH 10 exits I-89 onto U.S. Route 4, which it immediately joins westbound. US 4 and NH 10 cross the Mascoma River into the village of West Lebanon, where they intersect with NH 12A (providing local access to I-89). Just over to the north, US 4 splits off to cross the Connecticut River into White River Junction, Vermont. Now running along the eastern bank of the river, NH 10 continues north into the town of Hanover. At Dartmouth College in the heart of town, NH 10 meets its only child route, NH 10A, a connector to I-91 and US 5 in Norwich, Vermont, then intersects the northern terminus of NH 120 (NH 120 is cosigned with NH 10 on North Park Street). NH 10 continues north into the town of Lyme, where the only intersection of note is to East Thetford Road, a connector to Thetford, Vermont, which becomes Vermont Route 113 upon crossing the border to the west. Crossing into Orford, NH 10 intersects and briefly overlaps NH 25A before that route splits off to cross into Fairlee, Vermont, and meet US 5. NH 10 continues into Piermont and intersects with NH 25 (connecting to VT 25 just to the west) and NH 25C. NH 25 turns onto NH 10 northbound, and the two routes are cosigned for into the neighboring town of Haverhill. After crossing the town line, NH 25 splits off to begin its eastward trek across the state. NH 10 continues north along the Connecticut River and intersects the western terminus of NH 116 in the village of North Haverhill. Several miles to the north, NH 10 intersects the southern terminus of NH 135 and enters the village of Woodsville, where it reaches US 302, which crosses into Wells River, Vermont, just to the west. NH 10 officially ends at US 302, but is cosigned with it through Bath, Landaff, Lisbon and into Littleton to its intersection with NH 18, just north of I-93. History 75px NH 10 was first designated in 1922 as part of the New England road marking system. The original New England Interstate Route 10 extended from Route 1 (now U.S. Route 1) in New Haven, Connecticut, to Route 18 (now US 302 / NH 18) in Littleton, New Hampshire. When the U.S. Highway system was introduced in 1926, it supplanted the New England route system and the entirety of existing Route 10 was redesignated as state highways. In 1935, the newly designated U.S. Route 302 was assigned to the existing route between Haverhill and Littleton, effectively making the northernmost part of NH 10's routing redundant. As a result, NH 10 was eventually truncated back to the junction with US 302 in Haverhill, but for historical reasons it seems the state decided to post NH 10 signage along the former route. NH 10 as signed today retains most of its original 1922 alignment. The one major exception to this is the routing of NH 10 along I-89 between Grantham and Lebanon. Many segments of the former surface alignment are still in use, with several labeled as \\"Old Route 10.\\" Major intersections Suffixed routes =New Hampshire Route 10A= New Hampshire Route 10A (NH 10A) is an east‚Äìwest highway in Hanover. It is the shortest state highway in New Hampshire, slightly more than in length. The eastern terminus of NH 10A is in the center of Hanover at the junction with NH 10, which is Main Street. The western terminus of NH 10A is on Ledyard Bridge over the Connecticut River, which is the border with Vermont. Across the bridge, the road becomes Vermont Route 10A (Main Street in the town of Norwich). In Hanover, NH 10A is locally named West Wheelock Road.

The Religious groups were; Protestant, 72.8% (Baptists 35.8%, Church of God 11.7%, Roman Catholics11.4%, Anglicans 10%, Methodists 9.3%, Seventh-Day Adventists 6%, Jehovah's Witnesses 1.8% and Other 14%  History  = Christianity =  Baptist  The Baptist denomination was organized in the Turks and Caicos Islands in 1835 with its first church located in Grand Turk. Today the Baptist churches operate under the guidance of the Turks and Caicos Islands Baptist Union.  Seventh-day Adventist  The first set of Sabbath keepers were discovered in the Turks and Caicos Islands on the island of Grand Turk in 1906 by a Jamaican colporteur (religious book salesman) as he sold books. The church's main periodical 'The Review and Herald' of 16 November 1905 noted that \\"A woman on one of the Turks Islands at the turn of the twentieth century had come to recognize the seventh-day Sabbath through reading her Bible\\". In 1945 the territory saw the establishment of a permanent presence of the SDA church when Clyde Nebblett, another colporteur, migrated to Grand Turk with his wife and began a small prayer group that met in their home. Later that year the island of Grand Turk was devastated by the 1945 Homestead hurricane. This forced the Nedletts to move to Providenciales in the community of Blue Hills where 26 individuals were baptized through their efforts. In December of the same year the Turks and Caicos Islands along with Mayaguana of the Bahamas were organized into the Salt Cays Mission. In 1947 the believers on Grand Turk were organized into a church after an evangelistic campaign and Pastor Gordon Prenier purchased a warehouse and transformed it into the first Adventist Church building in the Turks and Caicos. Between 1950 and 1988 the territory fluctuated between mission and district categorization. \\"In January 1988 it reverted to mission status under the direction of West Indies Union\\".[4]When the mission was organized, it became a part of the West Indies Union Conference. West Indies Union comprised the conferences in Jamaica, the Bahamas, the Turks and Caicos Islands Mission, and the Cayman Islands Conference. In November 2010 at Northern Caribbean University in Mandeville, Jamaica, West Indies Union was dissolved and gave birth to the Atlantic Caribbean Union Mission and the Jamaica Union Conference. \\"The new configuration will see the formation of the Atlantic Caribbean Union Mission, comprising four Fields: the Bahamas Conference (now South Bahamas Conference), the North Bahamas Conference, the Cayman Islands Conference, and the Turks and Caicos Islands Mission, with approximately 25,000 members\\". Seventh-day Adventism has moved in sync with the population growth of the Turks and Caicos Islands, hence Providenciales, the economic hub of the country has become the island that has seen the most growth over the years. There are 10 churches in the Turks and Caicos Islands. Grand Turk has (2) Ebenezer and Antioch churches. Providenciales has (5) Bethel, Blue Hills, Ephesus, Filadelfia, Five Cays churches. There is a church on Salt Cay, Kews on North Caicos, and Maranatha on South Caicos.  Anglicanism  The Turks and Caicos Islands belong to the Anglican Diocese of the Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands within the Church in the Province of the West Indies. The Anglican Church has a significant presence ln the islands and among many-a-tourists.  Latter- Day Saints  As of January 2009, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons) were officially established in the islands. However, the islands are under the jurisdiction of the New Providence, Bahamas District. Until August 2006, the district was presided over by mission president of the Florida Ft Lauderdale Mission. After August 2006, the Bahamas and Turks and Caicos were reassigned to the Jamaica Kingston Mission.  Roman Catholicism  Prior to 1984, Turks and Caicos Islands was a part of Archdiocese of Nassau in the Bahamas. In 1984, it became a mission sui iuris (Independent Mission), the first Ecclesiastical Superior being Archbishop Lawrence Aloysius Burke. During that time the islands were served by a number of priests who stayed anywhere from a few months to a year and a half. In the three years prior to 1998 the islands were served by a priest who came for some eight months of the year. The remaining six months of those last three years there was no priest present on the islands. July 1998, at the request of the Holy See, the Archbishop of Newark provided two priests to serve on a full-time basis the Catholic community of the Turks and Caicos Islands. In the Fall of 1998 the Archbishop of Newark, Theodore McCarrick, assumed responsibility as Ecclesiastical Superior of the Mission Sui Iuris of Turks and Caicos Islands.

The lenses typically give the wearer's vision a brown or grey tint. The mirror coating decreases the amount of light passing through the tinted lens by a further 10‚Äì60%, making it especially useful for conditions of sand, water, snow, and higher altitudes. Mirrored sunglasses are one-way mirrors. The color of the mirror coating is independent of the tint of the lenses. It is determined by the thickness and structure of the layer. Their popularity with police officers in the United States has earned them the nickname \\"cop shades\\". The two most popular styles for these are dual lenses set in metal frames (which are often confused with Aviators), and \\"Wraparound\\" (a single, smooth, semi- circular lens that covers both eyes and much of the same area of the face covered by protective goggles, combined with a minimal plastic frame and single piece of plastic serving as a nosepad). Wraparound sunglasses are also quite popular in the world of extreme sports. The simplest version of a mirror coating is a single layer of a deposited thin film of a suitable metal, usually prepared by ion beam deposition, sputter deposition or vapor deposition. However, this kind of coating is very prone to scratching, and degrades, especially in a corrosive environment like salt water. More modern reflective coatings usually have several alternating layers of specific thickness, made of dielectric materials and sometimes metals. The metal layer can be made from titanium, nickel or chromium, or from an alloy like Nichrome or Inconel, and has thickness ranging from 0.5 to 9 nanometers. The dielectric layer comprises a suitable oxide, e.g. chromium oxide, silicon dioxide, or titanium dioxide; its thickness determines the reflective properties of the resulting dielectric mirror. The manufacturing process is similar to making anti-reflective coating, and mirror and antireflective coatings can be deposited in the same sequence of operations.

The purpose of applying the coating may be decorative, functional, or both. The coating itself may be an all-over coating, completely covering the substrate, or it may only cover parts of the substrate. An example of all of these types of coating is a product label on many drinks bottles ‚Äî one side has an all-over functional coating (the adhesive) and the other side has one or more decorative coatings in an appropriate pattern (the printing) to form the words and images. Paints and lacquers are coatings that mostly have dual uses of protecting the substrate and being decorative, although some artists paints are only for decoration, and the paint on large industrial pipes is presumably only for the function of preventing corrosion. Functional coatings may be applied to change the surface properties of the substrate, such as adhesion, wettability, corrosion resistance, or wear resistance. In other cases, e.g. semiconductor device fabrication (where the substrate is a wafer), the coating adds a completely new property, such as a magnetic response or electrical conductivity, and forms an essential part of the finished product. A major consideration for most coating processes is that the coating is to be applied at a controlled thickness, and a number of different processes are in use to achieve this control, ranging from a simple brush for painting a wall, to some very expensive machinery applying coatings in the electronics industry. A further consideration for 'non-all-over' coatings is that control is needed as to where the coating is to be applied. A number of these non-all-over coating processes are printing processes. Many industrial coating processes involve the application of a thin film of functional material to a substrate, such as paper, fabric, film, foil, or sheet stock. If the substrate starts and ends the process wound up in a roll, the process may be termed \\"roll-to-roll\\" or \\"web-based\\" coating. A roll of substrate, when wound through the coating machine, is typically called a web. Coatings may be applied as liquids, gases or solids.  Functions of coatings  * Adhesive ‚Äì adhesive tape, pressure- sensitive labels, iron-on fabric * Changing adhesion properties ** Non-stick PTFE coated- cooking pans ** Release coatings for example silicone-coated release liners for many self-adhesive products ** primers encourage subsequent coatings to adhere well (also sometimes have anti-corrosive properties) * Optical coatings ** Reflective coatings for mirrors ** Anti-reflective coatings example on spectacles ** UV- absorbent coatings for protection of eyes or increasing the life of the substrate ** Tinted as used in some coloured lighting, tinted glazing, or sunglasses * Catalytic e.g. some self- cleaning glass * Light-sensitive as previously used to make photographic film * Protective coatings ** Most surface coatings or paints are to some extent protecting the substrate e.g. *** Sealing and waterproofing wood *** Sealing the surface of concrete **** Film-forming sealers and floor paint **** Seamless polymer/resin flooring **** Bund wall/containment lining *** Waterproofing and damp proofing of concrete walls *** Roof coating *** Concrete bridge deck membranes *** Sealing and waterproofing of masonry *** Preserving machinery, equipment and structuresS.

Coating Analysis Numerous methods exist for evaluating coatings, including both destructive and non-destructive methods. The most common destructive method is microscopy of a mounted cross-section of the coating and substrate. The most common non-destructive techniques include ultrasonic thickness measurement, XRF coatings thickness measurement, and ultra-micro hardness testing. Coating processes Coating processes may be classified as follows: =Vapor deposition=  Chemical vapor deposition  * Metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy * Electrostatic spray assisted vapour deposition (ESAVD) * Sherardizing * Some forms of Epitaxy ** Molecular beam epitaxy  Physical vapor deposition  * Cathodic arc deposition * Electron beam physical vapor deposition (EBPVD) * Ion plating * Ion beam assisted deposition (IBAD) * Magnetron sputtering * Pulsed laser deposition * Sputter deposition * Vacuum deposition * Vacuum evaporation, evaporation (deposition) * Pulsed electron deposition (PED) =Chemical and electrochemical techniques= * Conversion coating ** Autophoretic, the registered trade name of a proprietary series of autodepositing coatings specifically for ferrous metal substrates ** Anodising ** Chromate conversion coating ** Plasma electrolytic oxidation ** Phosphate (coating) * Ion beam mixing * Pickled and oiled, a type of plate steel coating * Plating ** Electroless plating ** Electroplating =Spraying= * Spray painting * High velocity oxygen fuel (HVOF) * Plasma spraying * Thermal spraying * Kinetic metallization (KM) * Plasma transferred wire arc thermal spraying * The common forms of Powder coating =Roll-to-roll coating processes= Common roll-to- roll coating processes include: * Air knife coating * Anilox coater * Flexo coater * Gap Coating ** Knife-over-roll coating * Gravure coating * Hot melt coating- when the necessary coating viscosity is achieved by temperature rather than solution of the polymers etc. This method commonly implies slot- die coating above room temperature, but it also is possible to have hot-melt roller coating; hot-melt metering-rod coating, etc. * Immersion dip coating * Kiss coating * Metering rod (Meyer bar) coating * Roller coating ** Forward roller coating ** Reverse roll coating * Silk Screen coater ** Rotary screen *Slot Die coating - Slot die coating was originally developed in the 1950s. Slot die coating has a low operational cost and is easily scaled processing technique for depositing thin and uniform films rapidly, while minimizing material waste. Slot die coating technology is used to deposit a variety of liquid chemistries onto substrates of various materials such as glass, metal, and polymers by precisely metering the process fluid and dispensing it at a controlled rate while the coating die is precisely moved relative to the substrate. The complex inner geometry of conventional slot dies require machining or can be accomplished with 3-D printing. *Extrusion coating - generally high pressure, often high temperature, and with the web travelling much faster than the speed of the extruded polymer **Curtain coating- low viscosity, with the slot vertically above the web and a gap between slotdie and web. ** Slide coating- bead coating with an angled slide between the slotdie and the bead. Commonly used for multilayer coating in the photographic industry. ** Slot die bead coating- typically with the web backed by a roller and a very small gap between slotdie and web. ** Tensioned-web slotdie coating- with no backing for the web. * Inkjet printing * Lithography * Flexography =Physical coating processes= * Langmuir-Blodgett * Spin coating * Dip coating See also * Film Coating drugs * Adhesion Tester * Deposition * Formulations * Langmuir-Blodgett film * Nanoparticle deposition * Optically active additive, for inspection purposes after a coating operation * Plastic film * Printed electronics * Seal (mechanical) * Thermal barrier coating * Thermal cleaning * Thin-film deposition * Paper coating * Thermosetting polymer * Vitreous enamel * Paint References * Titanium and titanium alloys, edited by C.

He retired in 1812 due to ill health and was made Commodore-Governor of Newfoundland from 1813 to 1816. In 1821 he was made Governor of Greenwich Hospital in Greenwich, London. Keats held the post until his death at Greenwich in 1834. Keats is remembered as a capable and well respected officer. His actions at the Battle of Algeciras Bay became legendary. Early life Keats was born at Chalton, Hampshire the son of Rev. Richard Keats, Rector of Bideford and King's Nympton in Devon and Headmaster of Blundells School, Tiverton, by his wife, Elizabeth. His formal education was brief. At the age of nine, in 1766, he entered New College School and was then admitted briefly to Winchester College in 1768 but lacked scholastic aptitude and determined on a career in the Royal Navy. Early naval career Keats entered the navy as a midshipman in 1770 aboard the 74-gun under Captain John Montagu and followed Montagu when he was promoted rear admiral, given command of the North American Station and the governorship at Halifax. He served in a number of ships on the Newfoundland Station under his patron and his patron‚Äôs son Captain James Montagu. In April 1777 he was promoted to lieutenant under Captain Robert Digby in in which he took part in the First Battle of Ushant on 27 July 1778. As one of Digby's followers he was moved with him to the second-rate, ninety-gun . Prince William Henry, later William IV, served aboard Prince George as a midshipman for almost two years during this time. In 1780 Keats was on Prince George with Admiral Rodney's fleet at the Moonlight Battle that culminated in the relief of Gibraltar. Keats was with the fleet once more when it again relieved the beleaguered rock in 1781. In September 1781 Keats returned to the North American station with Digby in . Command On 18 January 1782 Keats was put in command of the store ship which was later fitted out as a floating battery in the defense of New York City. By May 1782 he had been transferred to the sloop in which he was part of the squadron that captured a French squadron including the 38-gun which was bought into British service. Bonetta was paid off in 1785 and between that time and 1789 Keats lived in France. On 24 June 1789 he was promoted to post- captain in , possibly at the behest of the Duke of Clarence (Prince William Henry) as a royal favour to a friend. Between 1790 and 1793 Keats commanded the frigate on the Channel Station. He commissioned in 1793 as the newly appointed flag-captain to the Duke of Clarence but was to be disappointed when the Board of Admiralty determined that it would be dangerous for the Prince and recalled him to London. Western Frigate Squadron In 1794 Keats was in Sir John Borlase Warren‚Äôs squadron in the Channel in command of the 32-gun frigate . In her he took part in the running battles along the French, English and Irish coasts that became highly publicized and exemplified the romantic image of naval warfare as it was perceived by the general public. In 1795 Galatea captured La Revolutionnaire. In the same year Galatea took part in the failed landing of an invasion force at Quiberon Bay. The invasion force consisted of French Royalist √©migr√©, counter-revolutionary troops in support of the Chouannerie and Vend√©e Revolt. They were landed by the Royal Navy on 23 June. The aim of the invasion was to raise the whole of western France in revolt, bring an end to the French Revolution and restore the French monarchy. The Landing of the √©migr√©s at Quiberon was finally repulsed on 21 July, dealing a disastrous blow to the royalist cause. On 23 August 1795 Keats in Galatea drove the French frigate Andromaque ashore and set her alight to stop the French refloating her. In May 1797 Galatea was at the Nore anchorage and Keats along with several other captains was put ashore during the fleet mutiny. Subsequently he commissioned the newly built 40-gun . Under Keats she served on the Channel station for several years during which time she captured at least three prizes. The first was the 22-gun Spanish ship Union, which she captured on 14 August 1797. On 9 December 1798 Boadicea captured the 20-gun French privateer L'Invincible General Bonaparte. The Admiralty took this vessel into service as the 18-gun sloop . On 1 April 1799 Keats also captured L'Utile, a brig of 16 guns. During this time Keats was stationed mainly off Brest. He continued there until 1800 when he was reassigned by Earl St. Vincent to Ferrol. HMS Superb and the Battle of Algeciras Bay By March 1801 Keats was placed in command of the ship with which he is most associated. was a 74-gun third-rate ship-of-the-line ordered in 1795 and completed in 1798. In July 1801 she was stationed off Cadiz and took part in the second Battle of Algeciras Bay. During the French and Spanish retreat Admiral Sir James Saumarez hailed Superb and ordered Keats to catch the allied fleets rear and engage. Superb was a relatively new ship and had not been long on blockade duty. As a consequence she was the fastest sailing ship-of-the-line in the fleet. As night fell Keats sailed Superb alongside the 112-gun on her starboard side. Another Spanish ship, the 112-gun , was sailing abreast, on the port side, of Real Carlos. Keats fired into Real Carlos and some shot passed her and struck San Hermenegildo. Real Carlos caught fire and Keats disengaged her to continue up the line. In the darkness the two Spanish ships confused one another for British ships and began a furious duel. With Real Carlos aflame the captain of San Hermenegildo determined to take advantage and crossed the stern of Real Carlos in order to deal a fatal broadside that would run the length of the ship through the unprotected stern. A sudden gust of wind brought the two ships together and entangled their rigging. San Hermenegildo also caught fire and the two enormous three-deck ships exploded. Superb continued on relatively unscathed and engaged the French 74-gun under Commodore Julien le Roy. Saint Antoine struck after a brief exchange of broadsides. The action came to an end with the intervention of Captain Amable Troude aboard . Troude placed his ship, which had been damaged in the earlier engagement and could not keep up with the main allied fleet, between the escaping allied fleet and the British. He fought off four ships before escaping into Cadiz. Both Troude and Keats were highly praised by their commanders and the general public. Troude received an audience with Napoleon. Nelson said of Keats in a letter to the Duke of Clarence: ‚ÄúOur friend Keats is quite well in his own person he is equal in my estimation to an additional Seventy-four; his life is a valuable one to the State, and it is impossible that your Royal Highness could ever have a better choice of a Sea friend, or Counsellor, if you go to the Admiralty.‚Äù After the Treaty of Amiens in 1802 Keats and Superb remained in the Mediterranean under Admiral Sir Richard Bickerton. When Nelson relieved Bickerton and took command of the fleet in the Mediterranean Keats remained with him off Toulon and accompanied the fleet to the West Indies in 1805 in the famous chase of Admiral Villeneuve that culminated in the Battle of Trafalgar. After the fleet's return to European waters, Superb was sent to Portsmouth to re-fit. Unfortunately, she did not rejoin the fleet off Cadiz until November 1805, missing the Battle of Trafalgar by less than a month. On 9 November 1805 Keats was made an honorary Colonel of Marines, received the thanks of Parliament and a presentation sword from the Lloyd's Patriotic Fund. The West Indies and the Battle of San Domingo Battle of San Domingo Admiral Duckworth took Superb as his flagship in 1806. Duckworth took the fleet blockading Cadiz and chased Contre-Admiral Jean-Baptiste Willaumez to the West Indies. Vice-Admiral Corentin Urbain Leiss√®gues had separated from Willaumez in the Atlantic and made for Santo Domingo to resupply and refit. Duckworth was in the process of resupplying his ships at St. Kitts when he learned of the French squadron anchored in Santo Domingo. Duckworth took his squadron of seven line-of-battle ships and attacked Leiss√®gues' five ships of the line. The Battle of San Domingo was the last open sea fleet action of the Napoleonic War. During the battle Superb suffered 62 casualties in what became an almost total victory for the Royal Navy. Of the five French line-of-battle ships engaged two were captured and three driven on shore and later destroyed. The British did not lose a single ship. The Baltic and the Second Battle of Copenhagen By 1807 Superb had returned to the Channel and Keats was relieved by Sir Richard Strachan. Keats then took command of and was promoted commodore with Admiral Gambier‚Äôs squadron in the Baltic where between 16 August and 7 September he took part in the Second Battle of Copenhagen. During the battle Keats placed a portrait of Nelson on the mizzen mast. It was later said that the portrait had encouraged and inspired the officers and men aboard. Keats was promoted rear-admiral on 2 October 1807 and moved into . He led the expedition with Lieutenant General Sir John Moore to the aid of the Swedish at Gothenburg. As a reward for his services he made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath. Keats moved his flag to Superb in early 1808. After convoying the Swedish trade from Gothenburg to England he joined Sir Richard Strachan on his expedition to the Scheldt river. On Superbs return to Portsmouth in 1809 she was paid off and Keats was promoted to rear-admiral of the white squadron. On 26 December 1809 was given the post of His Majesty's Commissioner for the Civil Affairs of Malta. In 1810 after a nearly twenty one year's continuous service took leave ashore. Governor of Newfoundland After only a few months however Keats hoisted his flag in and took command of naval forces off Cadiz. On 1 August 1811 Keats was promoted vice-admiral and joined Sir Edward Pellew off Toulon. Keats was forced to haul down his flag in 1812 due to ill health and in recognition of his service on 9 March 1813 he was made Governor and Commander- in-Chief of Newfoundland. During his term as governor the British government agreed for the first time to let Newfoundland settlers lease land for cultivation. Keats granted 110 leases around St. John's in the first year alone. In 1816 he returned to England and was succeeded as Governor of Newfoundland by Francis Pickmore. On 7 May 1818 Keats was promoted to the honorary title of Major-General of His Majesty's Royal Marine Forces. On 12 August 1819 Keats was promoted Admiral of the Blue. Governor of Greenwich Hospital, death and funeral Memorial to Admiral Keats, Greenwich Hospital Chapel In 1821 he was further honoured by his appointment as governor of Greenwich Hospital and investiture as Knight Grand Cross of the Most Honourable Military Order of the Bath. Keats died in Greenwich on 5 April 1834 and his funeral was held at the hospital chapel with the Admiralty Board in attendance. His coffin was borne by six admirals as pall-bearers. William IV ordered a bust of his friend to be erected in the chapel and it remains there, under the organ loft on the left hand side of the main entrance. The right hand side is occupied by a bust of Sir Thomas Hardy. Family In 1816 Keats married Mary, eldest daughter of the late Francis Hurt of Alderwasley in Derbyshire. There were no children from the marriage. Notes a. The battle is described in the novel Master and Commander by Patrick O'Brian, from the viewpoint of Jack Aubrey.

Waterman, Jr.. First published in 1982, it sold 3 million copies in its first four years, and was the most widely held monograph in the United States from 1989 to 2006 (WorldCat data). The book purports to explore the art and science of management used by several 1980s companies. Background =Context= In 1982, at the time of publication of In Search of Excellence, America was looking to Japan as the rising economic force. American businesses were studying Japanese management techniques and looking to learn from their successes.https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/entertainment/books/1984/09/16/management/fc85a178-19ae-421a-8e79-ac190911bd1e/ In Search of Excellence went against this trend, by focusing on American companies and studying what made the most successful American companies successful. =Origins= In Search of Excellence did not start out as a book, as Tom Peters explained when interviewed in 2001 to mark the 20th anniversary of In Search of Excellence. In the same interview, Peters claims that he and Waterman were both consultants on the \\"margins\\" of McKinsey, based in the San Francisco office.https://www.fastcompany.com/44077/tom-peterss-true- confessions In 1977 McKinsey director Ron Daniel launched two projects; the first and major one, the Business Strategy project, was allocated to top consultants at McKinsey's New York City corporate HQ and was given significant resources, but could not manage to effectively implement strategy. Peters states that directly after graduating with a PhD from Stanford, and returning to McKinsey, Daniel handed him a \\"fascinating assignment.\\"http://tompeters.com/2011/03/a-brief-history-of- the-7-s-mckinsey-7-s-model/ Motivated by the new ideas coming from Bruce Henderson's Boston Consulting Group, Peters \\"was asked [by Daniel] to look at 'organization effectiveness' and 'implementation issues' in an inconsequential offshoot project nested in McKinsey's rather offbeat San Francisco office.\\" While Daniel's first project was focused on Business Strategy, this second project was concerned with Organization, which Peters defined as involving \\"the structure-and-people side.\\" This \\"Organization\\" project was seen as less important, according to Peters in a Fast Company interview. Despite being described as \\"marginal,\\" the project \\"had an infinite travel budget that allowed [Peters] to fly first class and stay at top-notch hotels and a license from McKinsey to talk to as many cool people as [he] could all around the United States and the world.\\" Peters admits that \\"There was no carefully designed work plan. There was no theory that I was out to prove. I went out and talked to genuinely smart, remarkably interesting, first-rate people.\\" In addition to Karl Weick and Einar Thorsrud, Peters notes that Douglas McGregor's theory of motivation known as Theory X and Theory Y was directly influential on the direction of the project. In a 1978 article, \\"Symbols, Patterns and Settings,\\" Peters argued that \\"shifting organizational structure\\" and \\"inventing new processes\\" - structure and system, respectively - were only two tools of organizational change. Peters then outlines eight \\"mundane\\" tools that every manager has at their fingertips. He described this article as a \\"tentative presentation\\" and \\"the first public expression of these ideas.\\" In 1979 McKinsey's Munich office requested Peters to present his findings to Siemens, which provided the spur for Peters to create a 700-slide two-day presentation. Word of the meeting reached the US and Peters was invited to present also to PepsiCo, but unlike the hyper-organised Siemens, the PepsiCo management required a tighter format than 700 slides, so Tom Peters consolidated the presentation into eight themes. These eight would form the chapters of In Search of Excellence. In 1980, Waterman joined Peters, and, along with Waterman's friend Tony Athos and Richard Pascale - both academics - came together at a two-day retreat in San Francisco to develop what would become known as the 7S Framework, the same framework that would organize In Search of Excellence. In June 1980, Peters published an op-ed in the Manager's Journal section of the Wall Street Journal titled \\"The Planning Fetish.\\"Peters, T. (1980). The Planning Fetish. Manager's Journal,\\" Wall Street Journal. In this article, he \\"stressed the importance of execution and dismissed the whole idea of strategy.\\" As strategy was McKinsey's main operation at the time, this was seen as a \\"frontal assault\\" on the company, leading Mike Bulkin, the head of the New York office, to demand that Daniel fire Peters. The primary \\"innovative\\" theme that under-girded what would become In Search of Excellence was that \\"structure is not organization.\\" This also happened to be the title of a 1980 journal article authored by Bob Waterman, Tom Peters, and Julien Phillips in which they argue that the \\"picture of the thing is not the thing...An organizational structure is not an organization.\\"Waterman, R. H., Peters, T. J., & Phillips, J. R. (1980). Structure is not organization. Business Horizons, 23(3), 14-26. This article also introduced what would become the McKinsey 7S Framework. In December 1981, Peters left the company, after agreeing to a fifty percent royalty split with McKinsey. Later co-author Waterman stayed at the firm for three more years, but received no royalties from In Search of Excellence =Overview= The book consisted of three parts: # The Saving Remnant - introduced the background and methodology for the book # Toward New Theory - introduced their underpinning ideas about business and management # Back To Basics - coverage of the 8 key \\"themes\\" found in Excellent companies Key ideas =Part 1 - Approach and method= In the first chapter of the book, Peters and Waterman introduced the background for the book and their research method. Initial investigations They started out by interviewing leaders of successful organisations to get a feel for what themes emerged. They then refined their initial observations, using the approach described below. The McKinsey 7S framework Peters and Waterman were concerned with how organizations were organized and managed. They wondered whether structure follows strategy, as Alfred Chandler had suggested. To address this, their perspective was that: :\\"...any intelligent approach to organizing had to encompass, and treat as interdependent, at least seven variables: structure, strategy, people, management style, systems and procedures, guiding concepts and shared values (i.e. culture), and the present and hoped-for corporate strengths or skills.\\" They used these seven \\"variables\\" to create a visual framework, which became known as the McKinsey 7S Framework. The interviews and resulting insights They then used their 7S framework as a lens through which to evaluate organizational excellence. They conducted in-depth interviews with leaders at 43 \\"excellent\\" companies using this lens. They then reduced the set of emerging insights from these interviews down to eight \\"themes.\\" Companies covered Forbes.com provides a list of companies covered in the book, and their subsequent financial performance.https://www.forbes.com/2002/10/04/1004excellent_print.html This list includes only publicly traded companies. =Part 2: Intellectual orientation= In Search of Excellence is a critique of a \\"rationalist\\" approach to management. The second chapter of the book, \\"The Rational Model,\\" introduces and then critiques the rationalist approach. An example of the rationalist mindset is reproduced below: :\\"Professionalism in management is regularly equated with hard-headed rationality ‚Ä¶ It doesn‚Äôt teach us to love customers. It doesn‚Äôt instruct our leaders in the rock-bottom importance of making the average Joe a hero and a consistent winner ‚Ä¶ It doesn‚Äôt show, as Anthony Athos puts it, that ‚Äògood managers make meanings for people, as well as money.\\" (p. 29) By contrast, a more \\"social\\" form of management takes into account the realities of what really motivates people. This set of real human motivations is explored in the third chapter, \\"Man Waiting for Motivation.\\" The fourth chapter puts these concerns into a historical context, exploring the evolution of management theories between 1900 and the time of publication of the book in the early 1980s. The latest era of management is characterised as more \\"social\\" than \\"rational,\\" meaning that real human motivations drive business goals and activities. It also more \\"open\\" than \\"closed,\\" meaning that outside forces such as market pressures can shape the evolution of structure and organisation within a firm. This leads to an increasing concern with the ongoing evolution of an organization, and the role of culture in maintaining and shaping an organization. Ultimately, these chapters would be seen in today's terms as advocating for leadership over management. Leaders articulate values and purpose, and achieve buy-in to vision and values from employees. These chapters set the foundation for the rest of the book, which address eight core themes for the book. =Part 3: The eight characteristics of excellent companies= Peters and Waterman found eight common themes which they argued were responsible for the success of the chosen corporations. The book devotes one chapter to each theme. #A bias for action: a preference for doing something - anything - rather than sending a question through cycles and cycles of analyses and committee reports #Staying close to the customer - learning his preferences and catering to them. #Autonomy and entrepreneurship - breaking the corporation into small companies and encouraging them to think independently and competitively #Productivity through people - creating in all employees the awareness that their best efforts are essential and that they will share in the rewards of the company's success. #Hands-on, value driven - insisting that executives keep in touch with the firm's essential business. #Stick to the knitting - remaining with the business the company knows best. #Simple form, lean staff - few administrative layers, few people at the upper levels. #Simultaneous loose-tight properties - fostering a climate where there is dedication to central values of the company combined with tolerance for all employees who accept these values. Discussion =The \\"Drucker gap\\" ...= Before and after In Search of Excellence, Peter Drucker was probably the preeminent management theorist. :\\"'It is frustratingly difficult to cite a significant modern management concept that was not first articulated, if not invented, by Drucker,' said James O‚ÄôToole, a University of Southern California management professor.\\"https://www.latimes.com/archives/la- xpm-1985-04-14-fi-8368-story.html However, while Peters and Waterman reviewed management theory over the preceding eight decades within In Search of Excellence, they did not consider Peter Drucker's contributions to management theory within their review. According to the Los Angeles Times, Peters and Waterman had not read Drucker's work: :\\"Thomas J. Peters, the co-author of the hugely successful In Search of Excellence, says he earned two advanced degrees, including a Ph.D in business, without once studying Drucker.\\" It seems unlikely that Peters and Waterman were completely unaware of Peter Drucker, if for no other reason than they cite Drucker three times in the index of In Search of Excellence. Peters himself wrote that he read Drucker's The Effective Executive in 1968:https://tompeters.com/2005/11/peter-f-drucker- right-man-for-hisour-times/ :\\"But the truth is that, though [Drucker's] consulting was carried out in the stratospheric confines of CEO-world, his books and articles were very comprehensible and accessible to the likes of LTJG Thomas J Peters, USN, in 1968, when Peters, age 25, left Vietnam and was assigned to a forces management team in the Pentagon. No, the Stanford Graduate School of Business from which Peters got an MBA six years later, in 1972, did not assign as much as a single word of Drucker's work. But in 1968 Peters read (devoured!) his first management text, Drucker's The Effective Executive ‚Äî and was profoundly influenced by it. LTJG Peters was hardly alone!\\" Peters shared in an interview that when writing In Search of Excellence, he was \\"pissed off\\" at Peter Drucker: :\\"But I did have an agenda. My agenda was this: I was genuinely, deeply, sincerely, and passionately pissed off! ... Who was I pissed off at? At Peter Drucker, for one. Today, everybody acts as if Peter Drucker has always been one of those who gets it. Go back and read Concept of the Corporation. Peter Drucker may be an Austrian, but he‚Äôs more German than the Germans when it comes to hierarchy and command- and-control, top-down business operation. Take a look at the business bible according to Peter Drucker, and you‚Äôll see. Organizations are about organization! You vill be in your place! That was the received order of the day. So, in my mind, Peter Drucker was the enemy. A good enemy, but still the enemy.\\" Apparently Peters had construed Druckman as advocating a Taylor-style reductionism: :\\"...what Peter Drucker had sold to General Motors ... all went back to Frederick Winslow Taylor and scientific management. The theory that Taylor devised came to be known as \\"the one best way.\\" In essence, Taylorism said that every job could be reduced to a simple, repeatable, mechanical set of activities that even the stupidest, most unwilling worker could do.\\" After publication of In Search of Excellence, Peters re-read a wider body of Drucker's work, and commented: :\\"'I had considered at least a little of what Bob Waterman and I had written in In Search of Excellence to be new,' Peters said ... 'But upon rereading [Drucker's] \\"The Practice of Management\\" book, to my amazement . . . I found everything we had written (was) in some corner or other of that book.'\\" In 2005, on the occasion of Drucker's passing, Peters summarized Drucker's contributions to the theory of management: :\\"Peter Drucker did arguably :(1) \\"invent\\" modern management as we now think of it; :(2) give the study and craft of management-as-profession credibility and visibility, even though biz schools like Harvard had been around for a long time; and :(3) provide a (the first?) comprehensive toolkit-framework for addressing and even mastering the problems of emergent enterprise complexity. :And he did something else incredibly important: He popularized the study of appreciation of modern management. Doubtless Mr Drucker would have been appalled to be described as a \\"popularizer\\" ‚Äî after all, that was one of his abiding and biting criticisms of me.\\" Peter Drucker presaged and covered similar perspectives to Peters and Waterman's approach to management theory, for example in Drucker's The Practice of Management (first edition in 1954). Jim Collins noted in Built to Last (p. 254) that a number of companies featured in both In Search of Excellence and in Built to Last, such as HP and P&G;, \\"were tremendously influenced by Drucker's writings.\\" The omission of any reference to Drucker's theory of management in In Search of Excellence was a serious gap, undermining Peters and Waterman's claim that In Search of Excellence helped develop a new approach to management theory. This omission doesn't however change the validity of the points raised by both Drucker and Peters and Waterman. =The structure of the book= Peters and Waterman organized their work into eight \\"themes.\\" There may be issues with their chosen way of structuring this information for presentation, including atomicity and surfacing. 1\\\\. Atomicity Sometimes the one \\"theme\\" consisted of two quite different points. For example, \\"Hands-on, value driven\\" is about two different things: # Having a core set of guiding values at the core of the organisation # Leadership being \\"hands-on\\", for example through \\"management by walking around\\" or through open-door policies. These are related, because leaders being hands-on is a way to institutionalise and embed the guiding values. But conceptually these are two different points, and arguably are better discussed as such. Similarly, \\"Simple form, lean staff\\" is about two different things: # Simple form is about the organisational structure - what branches, divisions or companies # Lean staff is about a flat structure. These are different points. So much so that the chapter on \\"Simple form, lean staff\\" does not discuss \\"lean staff\\" at all. It is covered only in an overview of the chapter, elsewhere in the book. \\"Atomicity\\" would reduce each of the book's \\"theme's\\" to making a single major point. 2\\\\. Surfacing. Sometimes there is an idea within a \\"theme\\" that arguably deserves to be surfaced as a main theme in itself. For example, the theme \\"A bias to action\\" in In Search of Excellence also includes the sub-idea that excellent organizations adopt an experimental approach. Arguably this deserves to be raised to the level of a major \\"theme\\" in and of itself in the book - as it is in Jim Collins' Built To Last (in his chapter on experimentation, \\"Try A Lot of Stuff and Keep What Works\\"). =Peters' \\"confession\\" of \\"true data\\"= In December, 2001, Fast Company printed an article, crediting Tom Peters as author, entitled \\"Tom Peters's True Confessions\\". Most of the \\"confessions\\" were humorously self-deprecating remarks (In Search of Excellence had been \\"an afterthought... a hip-pocket project that was never supposed to amount to much\\"). One of them, however, used the term \\"faked data:\\" :This is pretty small beer, but for what it's worth, okay, I confess: We faked the data. A lot of people suggested it at the time. The big question was, How did you end up viewing these companies as \\"excellent\\" companies? A little while later, when a bunch of the \\"excellent\\" companies started to have some down years, that also became a huge accusation: If these companies are so excellent, Peters, then why are they doing so badly now? Which I'd say pretty much misses the point. :[In] Search [of Excellence] started out as a study of 62 companies. How did we come up with them? We went around to McKinsey's partners and to a bunch of other smart people who were deeply involved and seriously engaged in the world of business and asked, Who's cool? Who's doing cool work? Where is there great stuff going on? And which companies genuinely get it? That very direct approach generated a list of 62 companies, which led to interviews with the people at those companies. Then, because McKinsey is McKinsey, we felt that we had to come up with some quantitative measures of performance. Those measures dropped the list from 62 to 43 companies. General Electric, for example, was on the list of 62 companies but didn't make the cut to 43 -- which shows you how \\"stupid\\" raw insight is and how \\"smart\\" tough-minded metrics can be. :Were there companies that, in retrospect, didn't belong on the list of 43? I only have one word to say: Atari. :Was our process fundamentally sound? Absolutely! If you want to go find smart people who are doing cool stuff from which you can learn the most useful, cutting-edge principles, then do what we did with Search: Start by using common sense, by trusting your instincts, and by soliciting the views of \\"strange\\" (that is, nonconventional) people. You can always worry about proving the facts later. BusinessWeek ran an article about Fast Company's article. As related by BusinessWeek, the article was actually written by Fast Company founding editor Alan M. Webber, based on a six-hour interview with Peters. Peters reviewed and approved the article prior to publication, but the actual phrase \\"we faked the data\\" was Webber's, and Peters had not actually used these words during the interview. BusinessWeek quoted Peters as saying \\"Get off my case. We didn't fake the data.\\" According to BusinessWeek, Peters says he was \\"pissed\\" when he first saw the cover. \\"It was his [Webber's] damn word,\\" he says. \\"I'm not going to take the heat for it.\\" Criticisms =Market performance of the \\"excellent\\" companies= As early as 1984 it was apparent, to certain analysts, that the book's choice of companies was poor to indifferent. NCR, Wang Labs, Xerox and others did not produce excellent results in their balance sheets in the 1980s. Rick Chapman titled his book on high-tech marketing fiascoes, In Search of Stupidity, as a nod to Peters's book and the disasters that befell many of the companies it profiled. He notes that \\"with only a few exceptions... [the excellent companies were] large firms with dominant positions in markets that were senescent or static.\\" In an article in Fast Company, Peters remarked that the criticism that \\"If these companies are so excellent, Peters, then why are they doing so badly now,\\" in his opinion \\"pretty much misses the point.\\" =The \\"halo effect\\"= The research methodology employed by the authors of this book is also severely criticized by Phil Rosenzweigh in his book \\"The Halo Effect\\" as the \\"Delusion of Connecting the Winning Dots\\". Rosenzweigh opines that it was not possible to identify the traits that make a company perform simply by studying already- performing companies which Peters and Waterman did. Legacy =Reception= Almost 40 years after its original publication In Search of Excellence remains a widely read classic, and an influential book for leaders and managers. A 2002 panel of experts convened by Forbes rated In Search of Excellence as the most influential business and management book from the decades between 1980 and 2000.https://www.forbes.com/2002/09/30/0930booksintro.html#1f84979229e1 Inc magazine reported that by March 1999, In Search of Excellence had sold over 4.5 million copies.https://www.inc.com/magazine/19990515/4703.html Forbes in 2016 ranked the best-selling business books ever https://www.forbes.com/sites/natalierobehmed/2016/10/20/the-bestselling- business-books-from-blink-to-the-big-short/#2dda521e79f0 \\\\- based on sales tracking data that was not collected before 2004 - and put Strengths Finder 2.0 at number 1 with 4.5 million copies sold. Since In Search of Excellence had equalled this level of sales in 1999, and presumably made further sales in the succeeding 17 years, there is an argument to be made that In Search of Excellence is either the best-selling business book of all time or the equal best-selling business book of all time. =Impact= Tom Peters identified several key contributions from the book, that changed the field of future management books. First was the reorientation from a focus on strategy to recognising the importance of \\"soft\\" aspects of business like culture and people. :\\"The whole point of In Search of Excellence is hard is soft and soft is hard. There‚Äôs more to life than business strategy ...\\"https://www.managementtoday.co.uk/tom-peters-planning- overrated/leadership-lessons/article/1426550 Second was the use of research and specific case studies to bring ideas about management to life: :\\"[We] wrote case studies. And that is what everybody and his and her brother does today, but it was totally new at that time. Meaning that Peter Drucker had said extraordinary things and valuable things, but he never mentioned company names‚Äìnobody mentioned company names. We stuck our necks way out and gave the cases from IBM and McDonald‚Äôs and various other places.\\"https://www.fastcompany.com/1737410/leadership-hall-fame-tom-peters- author-search-excellence In Search of Excellence opened up the way for further research and publication around excellence in business. Jim Collins's books Built to Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companies and its sequel Good to Great are widely-known influential later works in this genre. Third, Peters reflected that In Search of Excellence brought management ideas to a broader audience than previous theorists like Peter Drucker had reached. =Ideas= The ideas in the book remain influential today. The book essentially boils down to five main tenets: #Maintain vision and values at the core of the organisation #Be customer-centric #Respect and develop employees #Be nimble and adaptive, with flat management structures and loosely coupled business units. #Continue to build core capabilities The authors advocated an agile, customer-centric organization with a core commitment to values. From that perspective, many of the points made in the book are timeless rather than ephemeral - and they stand strong today. =Performance= In Search of Excellence is not widely regarded as being great at predicting future success for individual \\"excellent\\" companies. However, the set of \\"excellent\\" companies studied, as a whole, still outperformed the market. A 2002 analysis in Forbes found that :\\"Over a five-, 10- or 20-year period, the Excellence index--an unweighted basket of the 32 public companies among Peter's and Waterman's 43--substantially outperformed the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the broader S&P; 500\\\\. Since October 1982, when the book was published, the companies on the authors' list earned an average total return of 1,305%, or 14.1% annually. This return outdistanced the DJIA companies, which earned an average annual return of 11.3%, and the S&P;, whose companies earned an average annual return of 10.1%.\\"https://www.forbes.com/2002/10/04/1004excellent.html#78240f5512af See also * Tom Peters * The McKinsey 7S Framework * Built to Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companies * Good to Great * The Halo Effect References  External links  *\\"Tom Peter's True Confessions\\", by Tom Peters, in Fast Company, November 2001, Issue 53 Category:1982 non-fiction books Category:Business books Category:Self-help books Category:Self-published books ","title":"In Search of Excellence"},{"id":"1897265","text":"David Ross Aizer (born November 24, 1974) is an American television host, writer and producer.

The series pulled in very high ratings for its daytime slot, and as a result at one stage, the show was given the green-light for an evening version to be made. For a short time in January 2005, the show appeared in a 5 p.m. slot, but this was soon dropped, and a full prime-time version never came about. ITV announced on 12 May 2006, that the show had been axed.

Together they established a military government that ruled Chile from 1973 until 1990. During the dictatorship Merino held short improvised press conferences on tuesdays that came to be called martes de Merino (Merino's tuesdays). These conferences gained notoriety by Merino's recurrent use of dark humor in addition to his \\"constant errors and aberrations\\". Early life and naval career Born in La Serena, he was son of Vice Admiral Jos√© Toribio Merino Saavedra, , and of Bertina Castro Varela. He entered the Naval Academy in 1931, graduating in 1936 as a midshipman. During World War II he served in the US Navy on the until 1945. After World War II he served in different units of the Chilean Navy such as: Destructor Serrano (2do), Crucero O'Higgins (4to) (CL02), Corbeta Papudo(1¬∫), Transporte Angamos (3ro) Between 1955 and 1957 he served as aide and counsel in weaponry to the Chilean embassy in London. During the construction of the s Williams and Riveros. In 1960, he was assigned as a teacher at the Naval War Academy (AGN) teaching Logistics, Geopolitics, Geostrategy. In 1969 he became Naval Director of Weapons. In January 1970 he was appointed as Director of Navy Services, and in November of the same year he assumed the command of the Chilean main combat fleet (CJE). Chilean coup After the military coup that ousted socialist President Salvador Allende on September 11, 1973, a military junta was formed to govern the country, and Merino was named commander-in-chief of the Chilean Navy. General Pinochet was soon named as the chairman of the ruling junta, as he was head of the army, the oldest branch of the Chilean military. As the navy was the second oldest branch, Merino was vice-chairman and second-in-command to Pinochet. As the second in command and also as member of the Governing Junta he was in charge of the economic sector of the country and presided over the Economic Committee of the Council of Ministers, where the economic measures were born. In addition, all the decrees were elaborated and the laws on the matters had to dictate to regulate the economic sector. From the Economic Committee of the Council of Ministers, he impelled, the first economic measures of the Military Government, the liberation of prices of goods and services; the fiscal cost was reduced and the interest rates were freed to give birth to capital markets ; the companies of the State were reorganized as well, standardizing them. By the end of 1974, he represented the Government and State of Chile before the Spanish Government, to renegotiate contracts that appeared unfavorable to Chile. Specially, the Pegaso contract renegotiated, successfully. The study of the Statute for foreign investors was initiative of Admiral Merino. He impelled the study and the decree law of exporter promotion of Chile, which gave origin to PROCHILE. In 1975 he participated in the Statute of the Governing Junta, the Legislative Commissions and the Secretariat of Legislation were created. Admiral Merino presided over the First Legislative Commission after a law established the organization of the junta was enacted on 1974 which made the ruling junta the legislative power of the country and vested formally Pinochet the executive power as the self-proclaimed new President of Chile. Under Merino's leadership, the junta as the Legislative Commission first legislated mainly for the economic sectors and of Foreign Relations, and soon, the Fourth Legislative Commission of the junta enacted laws for the Defense Sector. In this period impulse the Decree Law to discount the forestation, settling down incentives to develop the plantations of this nature in the country. Again it represented the Government of Chile before the United States Government and one met with President Jimmy Carter. With great sense of social justice, Law N 3,480, allowed to indebted of the System of Saving and the Loan Houses to re- pact its debts, which came to favour of workers of the medium class sector. During the conflict with Argentina over the Beagle Channel, Merino was one of the most belligerent junta members. He only reluctantly accepted Pope John Paul II's peace proposal, telling him, \\"I only signed the treaty because I'm Catholic and I respect Your Holiness. If I weren't, I wouldn't have signed it.\\" Also, he ordered the commander of the surface fleet \\"go there... and win the war\\". In 1980 law N 3,500 was dictated to the decree that created the new provisional system. Admiral Merino was a great defender of this legislation, giving his approval and endorsement during the study and discussion of this matter. He was the main legislative person in charge of the materialization. When in 1980 the new constitution was approved, Admiral Merino presided over the Governing Junta. This constituted the legislative power legitimized by the constitution and remained in effect until March 1990, when democratic government was restored. In addition the admiral presided over the fifth Legislative Commission of the junta. In 1982 the country was affected by the worldwide recession and the Government had to take economic measures to palliate the crisis that developed. Admiral Merino, from the Legislative Power, impelled laws on the modernization of the financial sector, guarantee of the State to the deposits and savings, lowering of the tariffs to the imports and in general, the normalization of the sectors more affected by the crisis, giving the maximum support to the Executive authority, which was allowed to remove to the country from the crisis. During this period he impelled the initiative of the Law of promotion to the Merchant Marine, remarkably contributing to the growth of this sector and also to the sector of shipyards and naval industry through the Law N 18.454. He presented the relative motions to replace the Code of Commerce; to adapt the Chilean marine limits to the Convention of Jamaica, by means of the corresponding reform to the Civil Code, and to countermand the legislation that allowed the therapeutic abortion, everything which was approved by means of the corresponding laws dictated in that period. The statue of Admiral Jos√© Toribio Merino in Valpara√≠so's Naval MuseumAlso, he impelled all the Constitutional Statutory laws, which allowed the Military Government to fulfill the constitutional itinerary and delivery the power to the civil elected authority. In 1989 he proposed to the Executive authority the law of Fishing and Agriculture, which was obtained after a great discussion in the sector. Its aim was to put the conditions for the conservation of renewable the marine resources. Finally, it corresponded to him to preside over the Joint Legislative Commission destined to reform the Political Constitution, whose text, approved by the Governing Junta, was ratified by the conducted plebiscite the 30 of June 1989. During the period of government of the FF.AA., under his tuition 3,660 Decrees were promulgated Laws and 1,090 Laws that take his signature. But Pinochet as the president of the country has the final authority to ratify and implement such laws passed by the junta and approved by Merino. He retired from the navy as its commander in chief on the 8 of March 1990, after more than 50 years of service. He was also the President of the Government Junta of Chile, the de facto Vice-President of the country from March 11, 1981 until his resignation on March 8, 1990. Later life After his retirement, he stayed out of politics and dedicated himself to his favorite pastime, playing golf. He started to write his memoirs, but did not live to see them published. He died of lymphoma in 1996, in Vi√±a del Mar, at the age of 80. The Chilean Navy in honour of the Admiral named after him the .

It is episode sixteen of season nine, and the final episode of the series. It originally aired on May 16, 2005, and was preceded by an hour-long special looking back on the whole series. Synopsis The episode starts with Ray walking into the kitchen having just seen his doctor. He tells Debra that the doctor told him his adenoids have to come out. Debra tells him that it's a routine procedure and Ray is appalled at Debra's lack of concern for his well- being. Marie worriedly comes rushing in and hugs Ray, saying the doctors are \\"trying to take a piece of my Raymond away.\\" Ray gives Debra a hard time over the course of the next week, fretting about his upcoming surgery and asking questions such as \\"What if the nurses' top button is undone and the doctor gets distracted?\\" On the day of the operation, Ray goes into surgery and Debra, Robert, Amy, Frank and Marie wait in the waiting room. Robert laments how the whole world has to stop because Ray is having a routine procedure, and states that the only reason he is there is because Marie dragged him there since he is the same blood type as Raymond. The family tells jokes to lighten the mood, of which Marie disapproves; she says that she needs to go to the bathroom and when she returns everyone should have a sign of concern. A few moments after Marie leaves, a nurse enters the waiting room and asks for Debra. Debra asks how the procedure went and the nurse, after asking whether Ray had any medical conditions that he did not disclose, states that they are having trouble bringing Ray out of the anesthesia. Debra starts to cry and the rest of the family (minus Marie who is in the bathroom) comes over. Debra tells them what the nurse said and everyone begins to panic. Robert attempts to rush to the operating table, telling the nurse that he and Ray are the same blood type and that he can wake his brother up. Just before he walks through the door, the doctor emerges and says that everything is fine and that it occasionally happens due to hypertension. Everyone is relieved and agrees that they can't tell Ray or Marie about what happened. Later that evening, Debra brings Ray ice cream in bed. She watches as he starts eating and looks at him lovingly, telling him about what she is planning to do the next day, breaking down when she starts talking about the kids. Ray asks her if it is \\"that time of the month.\\" Debra begins passionately kissing Ray. Meanwhile, over at Marie's and Frank's, Frank reflects on what happened. Marie notices something is up because he's too silent and he turned down dessert. She finally gets Frank to tell her what happened at the hospital and is hysterical when she finds out that \\"her son almost died\\" and nobody told her. Back across the street, Ray and Debra are still in bed kissing and Marie rushes into their bedroom, jumping on the bed and embracing Raymond. With a central theme of the series being Marie's coddling of Ray, an annoyed Debra says to nobody in particular, \\"I knew one day this would happen.\\" Ray is mortified that \\"his worst nightmare is coming true\\" and asks what is going on. Amy, Robert, and Frank come into the bedroom and Frank tells Ray about what happened at the hospital. Ray is furious that nobody told him, but becomes curious as to how everyone reacted when they thought he might be dead. There is a pause and Ray irritably envisions what he thinks must have been going through Debra's head, saying that while she has to plan a funeral and raise three kids herself, she can finally start dating again. The scene takes on a moment of seriousness when Frank shouts at Raymond that he saw Debra fall apart in the waiting room, telling his son \\"I've never seen her like that, and I'll tell you, I never want to see her like that again!\\" Amy says that Robert had to pull the car over on the way home from the hospital because he was crying after \\"You Are the Sunshine of My Life\\" came on the radio (though Robert claims he pulled over because he thought he hit a cat). Everyone leaves and Debra and Ray are alone again. While one of the themes in the show has centered on Debra's constant annoyance at Ray, they both express how much they love one another. The final scene of the series shows the entire family eating breakfast together after Frank breaks Marie's stove in an attempt to \\"work on it.\\" Each character seems to emote an amalgam of their signature qualities as they sit and eat together, and with Ray at the center of the table, Debra tells Ray, \\"It's getting a little crowded in here,\\" to which Ray responds, \\"Yeah, you know what? We need a bigger table.\\" Production Filming of the episode began on January 20, 2005 (Actual film was used for this series).Owen, Bob (January 20, 2005).'Everybody Loves Raymond' to forgo extended finale.

The highway connected US Highway 2 (US 2) to the State Highway Ferry Dock used before the Mackinac Bridge was built. It was retired and the road returned to local control in 1957. Route description Prior to the opening of the Mackinac Bridge, travelers wishing to venture from St. Ignace to Mackinaw City had to do so via ferry. M-122 began at US 2 (now Business Loop Interstate 75) near Straits State Park and traveled through town along Ferry Road where it ran southeasterly from the main highway. East of Hornbach Street M-122 curved around to the east near Paro Street. The highway ended at the State Ferry Docks on the southeast side of the city next to the Coast Guard station. History M-122 was initially assumed into the state highway system in 1929 as a connector between US 31 and Straits State Park. In 1936, US 2 was routed into St. Ignace and US 31 was scaled back to end in the Lower Peninsula in Mackinaw City. M-122 now provided a connection between US 2 and the new docks on the southeast side of the city. It existed in this capacity until 1957 when the Mackinac Bridge opened to traffic.

The trail is heavily used. The route =Lexington to Los Gatos= Below Lexington Reservoir, the trail runs alongside the highway, electrical lines, a water pipe from the Reservoir, and the concrete culvert containing the creek, while still providing a walk in the woods. There are two trails between Lexington Reservoir and downtown Los Gatos. The portion of the trail on the west side of the creek is the Los Gatos Creek Trail proper and is a smooth, wide, unpaved trail on an old railway bed. The portion on the east side is the Jones Trail near the reservoir which connects to the Flume Trail. The north portion of this trail is for pedestrians only as it's windy and goes down to the stream level in several places. Jones Road is an alternative for cyclists. The Jones and Flume trail connect with Novitiate Park and the St. Joseph's Hill Open Space Preserve. There is a limited amount of parking available in Novitiate Park and at the end of Jones Road. Mile marker on the trail There are mile markers on the Los Gatos Creek trail, with the mile zero marker being located about north of the trailhead from Alma Bridge Road. The first half-mile offers a significant drop in elevation. =Downtown Los Gatos= As the trail reaches downtown Los Gatos, the first access point is at the Main Street bridge. The trail then passes the 1854 Forbes Mill, which houses a history museum. It then crosses from the east to the west of Highway 17 via a dedicated bridge. From this point northward the trail is paved. Next, there is an access point immediately behind the Old Town shopping area. 250 yards to the North, there is an access point and a parking lot with a few spaces meant for the trail next to a small park north of Old Town that can be reached via Miles Avenue. =Vasona Lake County Park= The trail next runs through Oak Meadow Park and Vasona Park. Attractions in this pair of parks include the Billy Jones Wildcat Railroad and a T33 airplane that kids can crawl on. The trail follows the east side of the lake and goes up and over the dam. =Los Gatos Creek County Park= After travelling under highway 85, the trail next enters Los Gatos Creek County Park. Attractions in this park include fishing, a casting pond, and a dog park. A bike/pedestrian bridge across Highway 17 connects to the trail at this point. =Campbell Park and Downtown Campbell access= The trail goes through Campbell Park. Downtown Campbell is only a three block walk to the west from the trail via Campbell Avenue. The trail is present on both sides of the creek from Campbell Park south to the bridge just north of San Tomas Expressway. An parallel mountain bike single-track trail exists east of the trail on the east side of the creek between the trail and the freeway. =The Pruneyard= The trail next passes by the back of the Pruneyard Shopping Center in Campbell. The access point is at the northwest corner of the complex, behind the parking structure. The Pruneyard has offices, shops, restaurants, and a movie theater. =Willow Glen endpoint= The trail next heads through San Jose's Willow Glen neighborhood, ending at Meridian Avenue. =Northern section of the trail into Downtown San Jose= A section of trail connects Lonus St. and Dupont Avenue, traveling under I-280. This section provides a key link for the trail as a whole, connecting Willow Glen and Downtown and removing the previous surface- street crossing of I-280. This section terminates at Dupont Avenue, immediately below a set of stairs that allows easy access to the bridge that carries West San Carlos Street over the creek and the Caltrain lines. This bridge connects the trail into central downtown San Jose. Connections to the Los Gatos Creek Trail =Connection to the Guadalupe River Trail into Downtown San Jose= The Guadalupe River Trail can be reached by travelling east on the nice bike trail on Willow Avenue, turning left onto Delmas Avenue and then right onto Virginia Avenue. Travel east on W. Virginia Avenue until you reach the termination of the Guadalupe River Trail, which is on the northside of W. Virginia Ave, just east of the bridge over highway 87. =Connection to the Three Creeks Trail and future plans for improving the connection to downtown San Jose= The city of San Jose has been actively developing the Three Creeks Trail on an abandoned former WPR/UPRR rail spur. Most of that trail is complete. The northern end of this rail spur crosses Lonus Avenue, is part of the defined project, and is awaiting the opening of the bridge over the creek just south of Lonus Avenue. Opening this bridge will allow connection to the northern section of the Los Gatos Creek Trail without requiring travel on busy Lincoln Avenue. =Connection to the White Oaks Avenue neighborhood= A bridge across highway 17 connects to the trail at the south end of Los Gatos Creek County Park. =Connection to the Los Gatos- Saratoga Road bike lanes= The connection is via University Avenue and Miles Avenue, which is south of Los Gatos-Saratoga Road. The Town of Los Gatos has applied for grants to improve this access.

Much disagreement persists about the boundaries of the subgenre, and the extent that their lyrics are explicitly Christian varies among bands. For example, The Crucified explicitly rejected the classification of \\"Christian punk\\" while staying within the Christian music industry. Given the nature of punk and some of its subgenres, such as hardcore punk, many bands have been rejected by the Christian and CCM music industry. Christian punk has been deemed novel in that it \\"seeks authenticity in two differently organized and orientated cultures: secular punk on the one hand and Evangelical youth culture and CCM on the other\\". Ibrahim Abraham, Evangelical Youth Culture: Alternative Music and Extreme Sports Subcultures (2017), p. 53, . Some bands generally avoid specific mention of God or Jesus; likewise some bands may specifically reject the CCM label or express disdain for that niche of the music industry. For example, Ninety Pound Wuss vocalist Jeff Suffering said about the breakup of the band in 2000, \\"...[N]obody wanted to continue playing in [the] \\"Christian\\" music industry.\\" It has been noted that, \\"measured purely by record sales, Christian punk dwarfs all other religious contributions to the genre\\", with certain individual Christian punk bands outselling the entire market for the next largest religious punk genre, Krishnacore.Christopher Partridge, Marcus Moberg, The Bloomsbury Handbook of Religion and Popular Music (2017), Ch. 21: Punk and Hardcore, . History Christian punk's origins during the wider 1980s punk rock scene are somewhat obscure. The rise of the Jesus Movement and its cultural institutions, such as Jesus People USA (JPUSA), served as an incubator for various Christian subcultures including punk, in part through JPUSA's label Grrr Records. Crashdog is one characteristically punk band that was rooted in JPUSA. In the 1980s, many bands performed at Chuck Smith's Calvary Chapel in Orange County California. One popular band within that scene was Undercover, who proclaimed that \\"God Rules\\", with a combination of rockabilly and hardcore punk elements. Other notable early Christian punk bands included the Altar Boys, Nobody Special, The Crucified, Circle of Dust, Under Midnight, Scaterd Few and One Bad Pig. During the 1990s, the underground Christian punk scene grew as bands such as MxPx, Ghoti Hook, Squad Five-O, The Huntingtons, Slick Shoes, Dogwood, Pocket Change, Officer Negative, Blaster the Rocket Man and Headnoise greatly influenced many of their peers and paved the way for many bands to follow. In the 21st century, developments in Christian punk have paralleled the broader punk scene, with bands such as Relient K, Hawk Nelson, FM Static, Flatfoot 56, Stellar Kart, and This Providence becoming popular with more mainstream audiences. Fashion Christian anarchy symbol Fashion is similar to normal punk fashion, but features Christian symbols such as the Christian Ichthys, the cross, crown of thorns, the JCHC symbol, and similar symbols. Chi Rho is a popular symbol amongst more anarcho-Christian bands, such as The Psalters.http://www.psalters.com/ In Europe the most used symbol is a modified anarchy symbol made up of the Greek characters A and Œ©. These two Greek letters, \\"Alpha\\" & \\"Omega\\" (the beginning and end of the Greek alphabet), are taken from Revelation 1:8 and when used together in Christian art symbolize that God is eternal, omnipresent, and the giver and taker of life. The symbol is a visual play on the anarchy symbol but with a different meaning and intent. Religion There are strong elements of anti-authoritarianism in the punk subculture and in Christianity, such as challenging the uncritical acceptance of social norms in the church and the world. One illustration of this is seen in the concept of \\"anticonformity\\", which can be seen in Christian punk music, including the song \\"Anticonformity\\" by Krystal Meyers. Within this perspective, the Christian's view of anticonformity is different from the punk view. The Christian's reason for anticonformity is found in the Biblical Epistle to the Romans: \\"Do not conform to the patterns of this world, but be transformed.\\" Popular culture is also commented on or satirized by Christian punk bands. One of Relient K's most popular songs from their self- titled debut album, \\"My Girlfriend\\", contained the line, \\"Marilyn Manson ate my girlfriend.\\" Calibretto 13 wrote songs critical of MTV, such as \\"Why Can't I Be on MTV?\\" and conformity, as in \\"Sheep of the USA\\". The Deadlines, likewise, parodied horror film themes on their album The Death and Life Of.... One analysis notes that the \\"Evangelical authenticity of Christian punk is also predicated on the same anticommercialism of secular punk\\", which is \\"not a total rejection of commerce, but an insistence that the music and its spiritual sentiments supersede the profit\\". Detractors, however, view punk as anti-religious. Adherence to the practice of Christianity (or any religion, established or not) is, by definition, conformity to rules set forth by someone other than the individual for him or herself. Because punk is ideologically nihilistic, many view \\"Christian Punk\\" as an oxymoron and view it simply as a subgenre of Christian rock and completely separate from punk rock; although Christian punk appropriated punk sound and fashion, no other similarities exist and the two genres have completely isolated origins. Followers of Christian Punk tend to cite punk's individualistic values and argue that punk ideology does not preclude critical and non-dogmatic religious belief. Some Christian Punks also do not agree with or are very critical of organized religion. They say that real Christianity is not just a religion because it's not supposed to be about rituals and rules; attacking these notions of legalism is a common theme in Christian punk lyrics, especially with older Christian punk bands, such as Nobody Special, Ninety Pound Wuss, Scaterd Few, and One Bad Pig. They believe true Christianity is a relationship with Jesus Christ, not necessarily a religion. Many Christian Punks are against religion like other Punks, yet they are strongly in support of a personal relationship with Jesus Christ, separate from rules and tradition. This idea gave rise to Christian punk's term \\"JCHC\\", meaning \\"Jesus Christ Hard Core\\", which draws its name from an Officer Negative song of the same name. Politics Although punk rock has strong ties to anarchism and Marxism, Christian Punks are not a subculture of Marxism or a form of anarchy or communism, instead, it is a subculture with both Christian and Punk affiliations. This belief was often held by extreme conservatives during the 1970s and 1980s, however, this was primarily used because of the clash between the King-James-Only Movement and the Jesus Movement. Evangelists such as Jimmy Swaggart associated the Jesus Movement and Christian rock in general as anti- Christian. The vast majority of Christian punk bands do not advocate anarchy or communism; Officer Negative's logo is a parody of the Circle-A commonly associated with anarchism. Many Christian punk bands, especially pop-punk bands such as Relient K, FM Static, and MxPx, have very few songs about political topics; others, most notably older bands, contain strongly political lyrics in many of their songs. Political Christian punk bands come from a variety of areas on the political spectrum. The Psalters, who openly advocate the ideas of anarcho-primitivism, Liberation theology) and Christian anarchism, are Christians who believe God is the only true authority. Some politicized Christian punk bands are also socialists. Crashdog operated a section of their website devoted to political issues and candidates that they supported, such as former United States Green Party Presidential candidate Ralph Nader and various human rights causes. Crashdog disbanded in the late 1990s to start Ballydowse, a more political band which also took strong stances on human rights issues.Ballydowse's website Other Christian punk bands take more conservative stances. Calibretto 13's song \\"America\\", from their album Adventures in Tokyo, expressed the band's displeasure with America's moral decline. Christian punk bands are also often vocal against abortion in their songs. Rock for Life categorizes bands based on their advocacy for or against abortion; they include many Christian punk bands, such as Dogwood, Flatfoot 56, Relient K, and One-21, on their list of pro-life bands.

He is most known for the 1895 story of Travel Diary of Ebrahim Beg (sƒ´yƒÅhat nƒÅmeh-ƒ´ EbrƒÅhƒ´m-ƒ´ Beg). This work was critical in the development of novel writing in twentieth-century Iran, and played an important political role as well. The story was a criticism on Iran's political and social affairs. It was widely read in Iran and gained the interest of revolutionaries and reformers who made the Constitutional Revolution of 1906.  Life  Maraghei was born into a family of merchants who, although were initially followers of Shafi‚Äôi Sunni school, later became Shias. He received schooling until the age of sixteen and then joined his father‚Äôs trade and worked as a merchant. Facing troubles for agitating officials (of the kadkhuda and farash titles in particular), he left Iran for Tbilisi where he worked as a small merchant, at a time when Iranian workers were gradually moving to the city for work. He was eventually employed at the Iranian consulate, but the mismanagement caused him to leave. He then went to Russia and renounced his Iranian citizenship, which gave him a guilty conscience (he regained his Iranian citizenship later through a connection in Istanbul). Maraghei then took permanent residence in Istanbul where he became associated with Persian-language shams paper published in Istanbul and hablul matin published in Calcutta.  Travel Diary of Ebrahim Beg  The main character in the Travel Diary of Ebrahim Beg resembles the author himself. Ebrahim too is a merchant who lives outside the country of his birth, but has a mental and spiritual preoccupation with his homeland, and above all, he wants it to change and reform. Ebrahim lives in Egypt where his father took residence many years ago, and has a reputation as an honest merchant. He loves Iran so much that he refuses to speak Arabic. The image of his homeland Iran is conceived utopically. His love for Iran motivates him to travel there; but, he is also motivated by his father‚Äôs will that instructs him to take time off from work and travel for several years recording his experiences. Before reaching Iran, Ebrahim is saddened when he sees miserable Iranians migrants doing the most difficult labor. His despair is only exacerbated when he reaches Iran. Ebrahim travels through many cities, and everyone suffers from the same problems: people are ignorant and self-centered; the clerics are deceitful, act for their own profit, and focus more on ritual purity than on the well-being of the nation; state officials (even in consulates abroad) take bribes, disregard the rule of law, assign jobs without regard for merit, and subordinate the nation‚Äôs interests to colonial concessions. Then, there are infrastructural problems: no institutions exist to address widespread opium use that even has currency among the ulema, clean water is hard to come by and there are not adequate schools and health facilities. In Tehran, Ebrahim seeks to meet officials and explain to them the poor conditions of the country so that they may act. But, his eloquent descriptions are futile: officials become irritated and ask him to go away. Because of their response (or lack thereof), he puts his suggestions into writing. His reforms include respect for freedom and independence, the advancement of nation‚Äôs industries, promotion of culture, ending of colonial influence, and creation of a trade surplus.

Early life Reed attended the University of Central Missouri. Professional football career Reed played professional football for the Kansas City Chiefs. Professional wrestling career =Early career (1978‚Äì1983)= Butch Reed was trained to wrestle by Ronnie Etchison debuting in 1978. Early on he wrestled as Bruce Reed adopting the ‚ÄúHacksaw\\" nickname over time. Reed and Jerry Roberts beat Mike George and Bob Sweetan for the NWA Central States Tag Team Championship in 1980 and lost it to The Kelly Twins in January 1981. His next title also came as one half of a tag team when he and Sweet Brown Sugar won the Florida version of the NWA North American Tag Team Championship when they beat Dory Funk, Jr. and David Von Erich in 1982. Reed wrestled mainly for the NWA in the early 1980s and made a name for himself in their St. Louis, Florida Championship Wrestling and Georgia Championship Wrestling territories. =Mid-South Wrestling (1983‚Äì1986)= Reed established himself as a force to be reckoned with while competing in Bill Watts‚Äô Mid- South Wrestling from 1983 through early 1986. In Mid-South, he was known as ‚ÄúHacksaw\\" Butch Reed and came into the territory as a tag team partner for the main face in the territory the Junkyard Dog. Reed immediately came face to face with \\"Hacksaw\\" Jim Duggan over the ‚ÄúHacksaw\\" nickname. Back in 1983, Duggan was part of the heel group the \\"Rat Pack\\" along with Ted DiBiase and Matt Borne and used every dirty move he could think of to beat Butch Reed. Reed and Duggan would feud over the ‚ÄúHacksaw\\" name until Jim Duggan turned face. Duggan's face turn resulted in Butch Reed's heel turn when Duggan was picked to be the Junkyard Dog's tag team partner over Reed. Reed appeared on TV stating that \\"Butch Reed is going to start looking out for Butch Reed\\", which prompted the Junkyard Dog (JYD) to join him in the ring. After arguing back and forth, Reed attacked JYD and was soon joined in the attack by Ted Dibiase. On July 16, 1983, Butch Reed won the Mid-South North American Heavyweight Championship and proceeded to turn back JYD's challenges in subsequent months. In October 1983, Reed's arrogance made him agree to let the Mid-South fans pick a challenger for the North American title; he let them pick from the JYD, ‚ÄúHacksaw\\" Jim Duggan, newcomer Krusher Khruschev, and Magnum T.A.. The fans picked JYD but Reed dismissed the choice; he also said Duggan and Khruschev did not deserve a shot and instead gave the title shot to T.A. As fate would have it, T.A. beat Reed to win the title, then lost it 12 days later to Nikolai Volkoff. On the same night that Reed lost the North American title, he and partner Jim Neidhart beat Magnum T.A. and ‚ÄúHacksaw\\" Jim Duggan to win the Mid-South Tag Team Championship. After a few weeks the North American title was returned to Reed, claiming that the title match with T.A. was not legal since the fans chose JYD. Reed's run as a double champion did not last long as JYD got his title shot with Dusty Rhodes as the special guest referee. After losing the North American title, Reed and Neidhart focused on the tag team titles and defended them against all comers. When Magnum and Mr. Wrestling II challenged for the titles, they felt that the challengers had to put up something of their own: Mr. Wrestling II's mask. Mr. Wrestling did not unmask that night as they took the gold from Reed and Neidhart in a Steel cage match on Christmas of 1983. Neidhart and Reed started to blame each other and had a short, brutal feud. The Neidhart feud was soon replaced with one with Terry Taylor who came out to save Neidhart from being beaten down with a football helmet after a match. The Reed/Taylor feud raged all through the spring of 1984 and was instrumental in establishing Terry Taylor as a star in Mid-South. The feud soon expanded to include \\"Nature Boy\\" Buddy Landel as Reed's tag team partner and saw Reed attack Taylor with a ‚ÄúCoalminer‚Äôs Glove\\" on several occasions. After fighting with Terry Taylor for months on end, Reed's attention turned from Taylor back to his old enemy the Junkyard Dog. During a match, Reed and Landel attacked JYD as he performed under a mask as ‚ÄúStagger Lee\\" and painted him yellow. The war between the two brought in Sonny King and later Ernie Ladd to team with Junkyard Dog. After the tag matches, came brutal singles matches such as Dog Collar Matches. Just as the feud was about to reach its heated highlight, the Junkyard Dog left Mid-South and signed with the World Wrestling Federation without informing booker Bill Watts of his decision. This meant that the federation was without their biggest face and the shows had to be hastily rebooked. Watts brought in \\"Master G\\" (journeyman wrestler George Wells) to take JYD's place but the feud between Reed and ‚ÄúMaster G\\" never took off forcing Watts to rethink his options. When \\"General\\" Skandor Akbar entered the Mid-South and started to build a stable of heels, he presented Buddy Landel with a golden Rolex watch with the understanding that it wasn't actually for Landel but for someone else Akbar was trying to recruit. When Landel tried to give the watch to Reed, he became incensed, in the storyline, stomped on the watch, and started to brawl with his former partner. Akbar and his cronies came to ringside, which prompted Reed to rant on them getting the crowd behind him as he told them he didn't need back-up. When ‚ÄúHacksaw\\" Jim Duggan came to his rescue from a 3 on 1 attack, Reed's face status was cemented. The two Hacksaws feuded with Akbar's army of Landel, Ted Dibiase, Steve Williams, and Hercules. The two Hacksaws were successful at first, until Reed came up against Kamala. He proved to be too much for Reed, beating him all over the Mid-South territory before Reed quietly left. Reed would go to the American Wrestling Association for a short stint as Jimmy Garvin's bodyguard, but would return to Mid-South in the middle of 1985 only a few short months after leaving it. In October 1985, Butch Reed beat Dick Murdoch for the North American title. Around this time, he had a famous one-hour time-limit draw with NWA Champion \\"Nature Boy\\" Ric Flair and feuded with Dick Slater when Slater helped Ric Flair keep the world title. In January 1986, Slater won the North American title from Butch Reed through underhanded means. =NWA Central States (1986)= After leaving Mid-South Wrestling once more, Reed returned to Kansas City and the \\"NWA Central States\\" territory run by Bob Geigel. In Kansas, Reed initially teamed with Rufus R. Jones as the Soul Patrol. Reed later turned on Jones and joined the group of manager Slick (Jones' real-life son) in 1986. After a brief feud with Jones, Reed got involved in a feud with Bruiser Brody. That summer, he lost a Loser Leaves Town match to Bruiser Brody and left the territory along with Slick. =World Wrestling Federation (1986‚Äì1988)= Reed and Slick signed with the WWF and were brought in as a package. Reed dyed his hair blond and became \\"The Natural\\" Butch Reed, an updated version of Sweet Daddy Siki. He feuded initially with Tito Santana, a target of Slick's verbal jabs, and made his pay-per-view debut at WrestleMania III, where he defeated Koko B. Ware. In the weeks after WrestleMania, Reed targeted new Intercontinental champion Ricky Steamboat and faced him at house shows and on an episode of Wrestling Challenge. According to a persistent myth, Reed no-showed a set of TV tapings where he was booked to win the title, resulting in the championship instead being put on The Honky Tonk Man. However, in a shoot interview, Reed has said this is untrue. In fact, when the Honky Tonk Man won the title from Steamboat in June 1987, Reed was shown celebrating with Honky and other heel wrestlers in the locker room although, in fairness, that was a taped segment. In a 2018 shoot interview with KayfabeCommentaries, Reed contradicted his earlier statements in past interviews and confirmed that he did lose the opportunity to become the champion because he had indeed no-showed a bunch of tapings out of burnout from never being home.Supercard: Mid-South Ghetto Street Fight with Hacksaw Butch Reed. http://kayfabecommentaries.com In the fall, the WWF was heavily hyping a feud between Reed and Superstar Billy Graham, a former WWF champion who was staging a comeback after hip-replacement surgery. However, Graham's condition was such that he could no longer handle the physical demands of being a wrestler, so Reed and Slick's newest acquisition, the One Man Gang, \\"injured\\" Graham in a sneak attack that was used to explain his permanent retirement. Graham began managing the man who came to his aid, Don Muraco, with Muraco immediately entering into a rivalry with Reed. The enemies were on opposing teams in the main event of the first Survivor Series (Muraco took Graham's place on Hulk Hogan's team); Reed (a member of Andr√© the Giant's team), was the first elimination of the match, by Hogan. Reed competed in (and was the first wrestler eliminated from) the first Royal Rumble match in January 1988. Two months later, he was eliminated in the first round of the WrestleMania IV championship tournament in the first round by eventual tournament winner Randy Savage. Reed dominated most of the match against Savage, but spent too much time mouthing off to Savage's manager (and real life wife) Miss Elizabeth while climbing to the top turnbuckle. Savage caught Reed, threw him off for a slam and immediately hit his Diving elbow drop off the top turnbuckle for the win. =Jim Crockett Promotions / NWA World Championship Wrestling (1988‚Äì1992)= Shortly after WrestleMania IV, Reed and the WWF parted ways, Reed's manager Slick stayed with the WWF while Reed struck out on his own once more. Butch Reed resurfaced in the NWA's Jim Crockett Promotions as \\"Hacksaw\\" Butch Reed. He more or less immediately resumed his Mid-South feud with The Junkyard Dog. He was briefly managed by James J. Dillon before his contract was \\"sold\\" to Hiro Matsuda's \\"Yamasaki Corporation\\". Reed did not see much success in the early parts of his run with JCP; his biggest match was a loss to Sting at the Chi-Town Rumble on February 20, 1989. During the summer of 1989, Reed would flounder in the mid card as Jim Crockett Promotions grew to become a national wrestling organization. The Steiner Brothers were involved in an angle with Woman who promised \\"Doom\\" for the two brothers but never specified exactly what this meant. Woman unveiled her threat at Halloween Havoc 1989, a couple of brawny, hard hitting masked African-Americans. It was obvious to most wrestling fans that Ron Simmons and Butch Reed were under the masks ‚Äî they had both been on WCW. television shortly before Doom debuted, and they were the only two African-American wrestlers in the company with the same massive physical appearance ‚Äî but the announcers were made to keep up the storyline (although Jim Ross accidentally exposed Reed's identity on commentary during Starrcade 89: Future Shock). Doom won their debut match against the Steiners when one of the members of Doom pinned Rick Steiner after a headbutt with an illegal object in his mask. Doom followed up on this success by defeating Eddie Gilbert and Tommy Rich at Clash of the Champions IX, looking very strong in the process. Doom's next PPV outing did not come with the same success. Along with the Steiner Brothers, The Road Warriors, and the Samoan Swat Team they were entered in a one night, tag team round robin tournament. They did not score a single point, ending dead last in the tournament. Doom's misfortune continued as Woman soon dropped the team and left the federation. Then on February 6, 1990, at Clash of the Champions X, Doom were defeated by the Steiner Brothers and as a result of the stipulation were forced to unmask. Doom beat the Steiner Brothers at Capital Combat; at that point in time, the Steiners didn't lose very often. Doom won the tag team titles and quickly set about defending them against the former champions the Steiners as well the rest of WCW's very talented tag team division. In the fall of 1990, Doom soon feuded with The Four Horsemen and defended against them in two inconclusive tag team title matches at Halloween Havoc 1990 and Starrcade 1990. At Clash of the Champions XIV, Doom lost a non- title match to Sting and Lex Luger in a match that foreshadowed the trouble that lay ahead. On February 24, 1991 at WCW's WrestleWar PPV, Doom took on former tag team champions The Fabulous Freebirds and lost due to miscommunication between Reed and Simmons. After the Freebirds left the ring, Reed turned on Simmons and beat him up; this turned Simmons face and ended the team of Doom forever. Teddy Long sided with Butch Reed as the former Doom partners engaged in a short but intense feud. The feud culminated at SuperBrawl I where Ron Simmons pinned Butch Reed in a Steel cage match (referred to as a \\"Thunder-Doom\\" cage match). After the PPV, Reed left the company for a short while only to return in 1992 siding with The Barbarian and Cactus Jack. Reed and the Barbarian teamed up to defeat Dustin Rhodes and Barry Windham at Clash of the Champions XX but left WCW for good shortly afterwards. =Independent circuit (1992‚Äì2002, 2005‚Äì2011)= After leaving WCW, Reed went to the United States Wrestling Association where he once again started feuding with longtime opponent the Junkyard Dog. Reed even managed to beat JYD for the USWA Unified World Heavyweight Championship on October 12, 1992\\\\. Reed only held the title for a week before he lost it to Todd Champion. Reed left the promotion before 1992 ended. Reed next appeared for a notable promotion was in 1994 when he started to wrestle for the Global Wrestling Federation during its last days of existence. Reed became the second to last GWF North American champion on June 4, 1994 when he beat Rod Price for the held up title. The title had been held up the previous day after a match between Reed and Price got out of hand and ended inconclusively. Reed held the title for almost a month before losing it to \\"Gentleman\\" Chris Adams, who would be the last GWF North American champion. Reed continued to work on the independent scene on a part-time basis so that he could participate in the rodeo circuit in Kansas City. In 2000-2001, Butch Reed started working for Harley Race's WLW promotion. Reed beat ‚ÄúLuminous Warrior\\" for the WLW Heavyweight Title on March 31, 2001 and held the title until Dennis McHawes beat him for it on January 25, 2002. After losing the title, Butch Reed retired from wrestling. After being retired for about three years, Reed returned in 2005, appearing several times for Mid States Wrestling and eventually defeating Heavyweight Champion \\"Mr. Saturday Night\\" Michael Barry on November 11, 2005 for the Mid States Wrestling Heavyweight title. He also participated in the ‚ÄúLegends of Wrestling\\" tour in 2006. On September 9, 2007, he made a cameo appearance backstage at the September 14 WWE SmackDown! taping during a segment involving his former manager and SmackDown! General Manager Theodore Long. Reed's last match to date in his career was on November 4, 2011, teaming with Angel 5th, wrestling Justin Lee and Max McGuirk to a no- contest. Personal life In July 2016, Reed was named part of a class action lawsuit filed against WWE which alleged that wrestlers incurred traumatic brain injuries during their tenure and that the company concealed the risks of injury. The suit was litigated by attorney Konstantine Kyros, who has been involved in a number of other lawsuits against WWE. In September 2018, the lawsuit was dismissed by US District Judge Vanessa Lynne Bryant.

Opus Dei and Legion of Christ controversies John Paul II was criticised for his support of the Opus Dei prelature and the 2002 canonisation of its founder, Josemar√≠a Escriv√°, whom he called the saint of ordinary life. =Legion of Christ= John Paul II has been criticised for hindering the investigation into the charges of sexual immorality leveled against Father Marcial Maciel Degollado. This is despite the fact that Maciel was already under investigation by the Vatican in 1956 for drug addiction when he established the Legionaries in Ireland. At the time the Vatican had removed him as superior of the Legionaries and was investigating allegations that he abused morphine. Allegations about Maciel began resurfacing in the 1980s but were consistently ignored by the Vatican hierarchy, which approved bylaws for the group that effectively banned internal criticism of Maciel and allowed a personality cult to flourish around him. He was eventually found to have molested many seminarians and abused children he had fathered with different women despite his vows of chastity. Campaigners accuse John Paul II more generally of putting the interests of the Catholic Church above all and turning a blind eye to child sex abuse allegations. Birth control and gender roles John Paul II's defense of teachings of the Catholic Church regarding gender roles, sexuality, euthanasia, artificial contraception and abortion came under criticism. Some Christian feminists challenged views of his on the role of women in society, including the ordination of women. However, John Paul was being consistent with Catholic teaching. Problems with Traditionalists In addition to all the criticism from those demanding modernisation, traditionalist Catholics sometimes denounced him as well. These issues included demanding a return to the Tridentine Mass and repudiation of the reforms instituted after the Second Vatican Council, such as the use of the vernacular language in the formerly Latin Roman Rite Mass, ecumenism, and the principle of religious liberty. He was also accused by these critics for allowing and appointing liberal bishops in their sees and thus silently promoting Modernism, which was firmly condemned as the \\"synthesis of all heresies\\" by his predecessor Pope Pius X. In 1988, the controversial traditionalist Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, founder of the Society of St. Pius X (1970), was excommunicated under John Paul II because of the unapproved ordination of four bishops, which was called by the Holy See a \\"schismatic act\\". The World Day of Prayer for Peace, with a meeting in Assisi, Italy, in 1986, in which the Pope prayed only with the Christians, was heavily criticised as giving the impression that syncretism and indifferentism were openly embraced by the Papal Magisterium. When a second 'Day of Prayer for Peace in the World' was held, in 2002, it was condemned as confusing the laity and compromising to \\"false religions\\". Likewise criticised were his kissing of the Qur'an in Damascus, Syria, on one of his travels on 6 May 2001. His call for religious freedom was not always supported; bishops like Ant√¥nio de Castro Mayer promoted religious tolerance, but at the same time rejected the Vatican II principle of religious liberty as being liberalist and already condemned by Pope Pius IX in his Syllabus errorum (1864) and at the First Vatican Council. Some Catholics opposed his beatification and canonization for the above reasons. Religion and AIDS John Paul's position against artificial birth control, including the use of condoms to prevent the spread of HIV, was harshly criticised by doctors and AIDS activists, who said that it led to countless deaths and millions of AIDS orphans. However, some experts have questioned the efficacy of condom distribution. Edward C. Green, director of the AIDS Prevention Research Project at the Harvard Center for Population and Development Studies: \\"We have found no consistent associations between condom use and lower HIV-infection rates, which, 25 years into the pandemic, we should be seeing if this intervention was working. James Shelton, of the US Agency for International Development, said that one of the ten damaging myths about the fight against AIDS is that condoms are the answer. \\"Condoms alone have limited impact in generalised epidemics [as in Africa],\\" Shelton wrote. Critics have also claimed that large families are caused by lack of contraception and exacerbate Third World poverty and problems such as street children in South America. The Catholic Agency for Overseas Development published a paper stating, \\"Any strategy that enables a person to move from a higher-risk towards the lower end of the continuum, [we] believe, is a valid risk reduction strategy.\\" Child sex abuse scandals John Paul II was also criticised by members of the abuse victims' group Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP), for failing to respond appropriately to the sex abuse crisis. In 2002, he wrote that \\"there is no place in the priesthood and religious life for those who would harm the young\\".Walsh, John Paul II: A Light for the World (2003), p. 62 The Church instituted reforms to prevent future abuse by requiring background checks for Church employees and, because a significant majority of victims were teenage boys, disallowing ordination of men with \\"deep-seated homosexual tendencies\\". They now require dioceses faced with an allegation to alert the authorities, conduct an investigation and remove the accused from duty. In 2008, the Church asserted that the scandal was a very serious problem and estimated that it was \\"probably caused by 'no more than 1 percent'\\" (or 5,000) of the over 500,000 Catholic priests worldwide. In addition to cases of abuse, much of the scandal has focused around members of the Catholic hierarchy who did not report abuse allegations to the civil authorities. In many cases they reassigned those accused to other locations where they continued to have contact with minors.Bruni, p.336 In defending their actions, some bishops and psychiatrists contended that the prevailing psychology of the times suggested that people could be cured of such behavior through counseling.Plante, Thomas: A Perspective on Clergy Sexual Abuse, San Jose Mercury News, 24 March 2002 (updated online version) Members of the church hierarchy have argued that media coverage has been excessive. In response to the widening scandal, Pope John Paul II emphasised the spiritual nature of the offenses. He declared in 2001 that \\"a sin against the Sixth Commandment of the Decalogue by a cleric with a minor under 18 years of age is to be considered a grave sin, or delictum gravius.\\" With the approval of the Vatican, the hierarchy of the church in the United States said that it instituted reforms to prevent future abuse including requiring background checks for Church employees and volunteers, while opposing extensions of the statutes of limitations in sex abuse cases. Centralisation He was criticised for recentralising power back to the Vatican following what some viewed as a decentralisation by Pope John XXIII. As such he was regarded by some as a strict authoritarian. Conversely, he was also criticised for spending far too much time preparing for and undertaking foreign travel. The frequency of his trips, it was said, not only undermined the \\"specialness\\" of papal visits, but took him away from important business at the Vatican and allowed the Church, administratively speaking, to drift. Especially in South America, he was criticised for conservative bias in his appointments of bishops; with an unusually long reign of over 25 years, the majority of bishops in place at his death had been appointed by him. Opposition to his beatification Some Catholic theologians disagreed with the call for beatification of Pope John Paul II. Eleven dissident theologians, including Jesuit professor Jose Maria Castillo and Italian theologian Giovanni Franzoni raised seven points, including his stance against contraception and the ordination of women as well as the Church scandals that presented \\"facts which according to their consciences and convictions should be an obstacle to beatification\\".

It is based on the autobiographical book The Pianist (1946), a Holocaust memoir by the Polish-Jewish pianist and composer W≈Çadys≈Çaw Szpilman, a Holocaust survivor. The film was a co-production of France, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Poland. The Pianist met with significant critical praise, and received multiple awards and nominations. It was awarded the Palme d'Or at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival. At the 75th Academy Awards, the film won for Best Director (Polanski), Best Adapted Screenplay (Harwood), and Best Actor (Brody), and was nominated for four others, including Best Picture. It also won the BAFTA Award for Best Film and BAFTA Award for Best Direction in 2003, and seven French C√©sars, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor for Brody. It was included in BBC's 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century in 2016. Plot In September 1939, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Szpilman, a Polish-Jewish pianist, is playing live on the radio in Warsaw when the station is bombed during Nazi Germany's invasion of Poland. Hoping for a quick victory, Szpilman rejoices with his family at home when he learns that Britain and France have declared war on Germany, but the promised aid does not come. Fighting lasts for just over a month, with both the German and Soviet armies invading Poland at the same time on different fronts. Warsaw becomes part of the Nazi-controlled General Government. Jews are soon prevented from working or owning businesses, and are also made to wear blue Star of David armbands. By November 1940, Szpilman and his family are forced from their home into the isolated and overcrowded Warsaw Ghetto, where conditions only get worse. People starve, the SS guards are brutal, starving children are abandoned and there are dead bodies everywhere. On one occasion, the Szpilmans witness the SS kill an entire family in an apartment across the street during a round-up, including dumping a wheelchair-bound man out a window. On 16 August 1942, Szpilman and his family are transported to Treblinka extermination camp as part of Operation Reinhard. But a friend in the Jewish Ghetto Police recognizes W≈Çadys≈Çaw at the Umschlagplatz, and separates him from his family. He becomes a slave labourer, and learns of a coming Jewish revolt. He helps the resistance by smuggling weapons into the ghetto, on one occasion narrowly avoiding a suspicious guard. Szpilman eventually manages to escape, and goes into hiding with help from a non-Jewish friend, Andrzej Bogucki, and his wife, Janina. In April 1943, Szpilman watches from his window as the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, which he aided, unfolds, and then ultimately fails. After a neighbor discovers Szpilman in the flat, he is forced to flee to a second hiding place. The new room has a piano in it, but he is compelled to keep quiet, while beginning to suffer from jaundice. In August 1944, during the Warsaw Uprising, the Armia Krajowa attacks a German building across the street from Szpilman's hideout. Tank shells hit the apartment, forcing him to flee. Over the course of the following months, Warsaw is destroyed. Szpilman is left alone to search desperately for shelter and supplies among the ruins. He eventually makes his way to a house where he finds a can of pickled cucumbers. While trying to open it, he is noticed by Wehrmacht officer Wilm Hosenfeld, who learns that Szpilman is a pianist. He asks Szpilman to play on a grand piano in the house. The decrepit Szpilman manages to play Chopin's \\"Ballade in G minor\\". Hosenfeld lets Szpilman hide in the attic of the empty house. Whilst there, he is regularly supplied with food by the German officer. In January 1945, the Germans are retreating from the Red Army. Hosenfeld meets Szpilman for the last time, promising he will listen to him on Polish Radio after the war. He gives Szpilman his greatcoat to keep warm, and leaves. In Spring 1945, former inmates of a Nazi concentration camp pass by a Soviet prisoner-of-war camp holding captured German soldiers and verbally abuse them. Hosenfeld, being one of the prisoners, overhears a released inmate lamenting over his former career as a violinist. He asks him whether he knows Szpilman, which he confirms, and Hosenfeld wishes him to beg Szpilman, to return his favour and help release him. Later the violinist and Szpilman reach the prisoners camp, but find it abandoned. After the war, Szpilman is back at the Polish Radio, where he performs Chopin's \\"Grand Polonaise brillante\\" to a large prestigious audience. An epilogue states that Szpilman died in 2000 at the age of 88, whereas Hosenfeld died in 1952, still in Soviet captivity.

He ended up living in a Polish farmer's barn until the war's end. His father almost died in the camps, but they reunited after the end of World War II. Joseph Fiennes was Polanski's first choice for the lead role, but he turned it down due to a previous commitment to a theatrical role. Over 1,400 actors auditioned for the role of Szpilman at a casting call in London. Unsatisfied with all who tried, Polanski sought to cast Adrien Brody, whom he saw as ideal for the role during their first meeting in Paris. Principal photography on The Pianist began on 9 February 2001 in Babelsberg Studio in Potsdam, Germany. The Warsaw Ghetto and the surrounding city were recreated on the backlot of Babelsberg Studio as they would have looked during the war. Old Soviet Army barracks were used to create the ruined city, as they were going to be destroyed anyway. The first scenes of the film were shot at the old army barracks. Soon after, the film crew moved to a villa in Potsdam, which served as the house where Szpilman meets Hosenfeld. On 2 March 2001, filming then moved to an abandoned Soviet military hospital in Beelitz, Germany. The scenes that featured German soldiers destroying a Warsaw hospital with flamethrowers were filmed here. On 15 March, filming finally moved to Babelsberg Studios. The first scene shot at the studio was the complex and technically demanding scene in which Szpilman witnesses the ghetto uprising. Filming at the studios ended on 26 March, and moved to Warsaw on 29 March. The rundown district of Praga was chosen for filming because of its abundance of original buildings. The art department built onto these original buildings, re-creating World War II‚Äìera Poland with signs and posters from the period. Additional filming also took place around Warsaw. The Umschlagplatz scene where Szpilman, his family, and hundreds of other Jews wait to be taken to the extermination camps was filmed at the National Defence University of Warsaw. Principal photography ended in July 2001, and was followed by months of post-production in Paris. Reception The Pianist was widely acclaimed by critics, with Brody's performance, Harwood's screenplay, and Polanski's direction receiving special praise. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 95% based on 181 reviews, with an average rating of 8.23/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Well-acted and dramatically moving, The Pianist is Polanski's best work in years.\\" On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 85 out of 100, based on 40 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave a positive review of the film, noting that, \\"perhaps that impassive quality reflects what [director Roman] Polanski wants to say. ... By showing Szpilman as a survivor, but not a fighter or a hero‚Äîas a man who does all he can to save himself, but would have died without enormous good luck and the kindness of a few non-Jews‚ÄîPolanski is reflecting ... his own deepest feelings: that he survived, but need not have, and that his mother died and left a wound that had never healed.\\" Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune said that the film \\"is the best dramatic feature I've seen on the Holocaust experience, so powerful a statement on war, inhumanity, and art's redemption that it may signal Polanski's artistic redemption\\". He would later go on to say that the film \\"illustrates that theme and proves that Polanski's own art has survived the chaos of his life‚Äîand the hell that war and bigotry once made of it\\". Richard Schickel of Time magazine called it a \\"raw, unblinkable film\\", and said that, \\"We admire this film for its harsh objectivity and refusal to seek our tears, our sympathies.\\" Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said that the film \\"contains moments of irony, of ambiguity, and of strange beauty, as when we finally get a look at Warsaw and see a panorama of destruction, a world of color bombed into black-and-white devastation\\". He also said that, \\"In the course of showing us a struggle for survival, in all its animal simplicity, Polanski also gives us humanity, in all its complexity.\\" A.O. Scott of The New York Times said that Szpilman \\"comes to resemble one of Samuel Beckett's gaunt existential clowns, shambling through a barren, bombed-out landscape clutching a jar of pickles. He is like the walking punchline to a cosmic jest of unfathomable cruelty.\\" He also felt that \\"Szpilman's encounter, in the war's last days, with a music-loving German officer, \\"courted sentimentality by associating the love of art with moral decency, an equation the Nazis themselves, steeped in Beethoven and Wagner, definitively refuted\\". Home release The Pianist was released digitally on 27 May 2003 in a double-sided disc Special Edition DVD, with the film on one side and special features on the other. Some Bonus Material included a making- of, interviews with Brody, Polanski, and Harwood, and clips of Szpilman playing the piano. The Polish DVD edition included an audio commentary track by production designer Starski and director of photography Edelman. Universal Studios Home Entertainment released the film on HD-DVD on 8 January 2008 with extras comprising the featurette \\"A Story of Survival\\" and rare footage of the real W≈Çadys≈Çaw Szpilman playing his piano, as well as additional interviews with Adrien Brody and other crew. Optimum Home Entertainment released The Pianist to the European market on Blu-ray as part of their StudioCanal Collection on 13 September 2010, the film's second release on Blu-ray. The first was troublesome due to issues with subtitles; the initial BD lacked subtitles for spoken German dialogue. Optimum later rectified this, but the initial release also lacked notable special features. The StudioCanal Collection version includes an extensive Behind the Scenes look, as well as several interviews with the makers of the film and Szpilman's relatives. Music * The piano piece heard at the beginning of the film is Chopin's Nocturne in C-sharp minor Lento con gran espressione, Op. posth. * The piano piece that is heard being played by a next door neighbour while Szpilman was in hiding at an apartment is also an arrangement of Um√≥wi≈Çem siƒô z niƒÖ na dziewiƒÖtƒÖ. * The piano music heard in the abandoned house when Szpilman had just discovered a hiding place in the attic is the Piano Sonata No. 14 (Moonlight Sonata) by Beethoven. It would later be revealed that German officer Hosenfeld was the pianist. The German composition juxtaposed with the mainly Polish/Chopin selection of Szpilman. * The piano piece played when Szpilman is confronted by Hosenfeld is Chopin's Ballade No. 1 in G minor, Op. 23, but the version played in the movie was shortened (the entire piece lasts about 10 minutes). * The cello piece heard at the middle of the film, played by Dorota, is the Prelude from Bach's Cello Suite No. 1. * The piano piece heard at the end of the film, played with an orchestra, is Chopin's Grande Polonaise brillante, Op. 22. * Shots of Szpilman's hands playing the piano in close-up were performed by Polish classical pianist Janusz Olejniczak (b. 1952), who also performed on the soundtrack. * Since Polanski wanted the film to be as realistic as possible, any scene showing Brody playing was actually his playing overdubbed by recordings performed by Olejniczak. In order for Brody's playing to look like it was at the level of Szpilman's, he spent many months prior to and during the filming practising so that his keystrokes on the piano would convince viewers that Brody himself was playing.

Hossein Sadjadi Ghaemmaghami Farahani (, better known by his pen name Kader Abdolah (), is a Persian‚ÄìDutch writer, poet and columnist. His books, written in Dutch, often contain Persian literary themes. He regularly appears on Dutch TV as well.  Life  Kader Abdolah is one of the descendants of Mirza Abu'l-Qasem Qa'em-Maqam, the Iranian politician during the Qajar period who was also affiliated with art and literature. Kader Abdolah had for long wished of becoming an author. He used his political passion to begin his career after the Islamic revolution in 1979 by writing articles in the left political newspapers. In the 1980s, he wrote two novels which were published illegally because of the political constraints: What are the Kurds saying? and Kurdistan after the resistance party. When he immigrated to the Netherlands, he felt as if political issues were no longer relevant to his life and he fell into a state of depression because he had thought of political activities as the essence of his life. Learning Dutch and to write in the language is therefore described by him as a political tool for fighting. Literature had turned into the incentive for a new fight. Career Kader Abdolah studied physics in Arak College of Science (today's Arak university) in Arak, Iran and graduated in 1977. After graduation he served his mandatory military service at Iranian Navy in Bandar Pahlavi (today's Bandar-e-Anzali) During the revolution he joined the left- wing movement opposing the Shah ‚Äì and later the Khomeini ‚Äì regimes.

Mendoza was born in Santiago, the youngest of the eleven children of Atilio Mendoza Valdebenito, a science teacher and first mayor of La Cisterna, and Amalia Dur√°n, a pianist. In 1938, young C√©sar Mendoza began his compulsory military service. In 1940, he matriculated at the Carabineros' School, from which he was graduated as a second lieutenant the following year. Mendoza worked in different cities during his police career, starting in 1942 as a lieutenant at Molina, Talca, and the Carabineros' School. He was promoted to captain in 1953, to major in 1959, to lieutenant colonel in 1965, to colonel in 1968, to general in 1970, and to general inspector in 1972. On 10 September 1973 Mendoza was the eighth in rank in the Chilean Police Corps, a professional military body which could have stood up to the army in defense of the Allende government. He agreed to join the coup leaders who promoted him to General Director. In this position, he eventually formed part of the Government Junta that came into power in the September 11 1973 coup d'√©tat (which coincidentally happened on Mendoza's birthday). Of the four members of the Junta (who represented the Chilean Army, Air Force, Navy and Carabineros or National Police), Mendoza was widely considered the one who held the least amount of power and influence, even being derisively referred to as Mendocita. Mendoza served in the Government Junta until August 2, 1985, where the public outcry from Caso Degollados led to his forced resignation. He was replaced by Rodolfo Stange Oelckers. A noted horseman, Mendoza won a silver medal in the XV Olympiad of 1952 at Helsinki as a member of the show jumping team.

The process is a photographic variant of chromolithography (color lithography). History The process was invented in the 1880s by Hans Jakob Schmid (1856‚Äì1924), an employee of the Swiss company Orell Gessner F√ºssli‚Äîa printing firm whose history began in the 16th century. F√ºssli founded the stock company Photochrom Z√ºrich (later Photoglob Z√ºrich AG) as the business vehicle for the commercial exploitation of the process and both F√ºssli and Photoglob continue to exist today. From the mid-1890s the process was licensed by other companies, including the Detroit Photographic Company in the US (making it the basis of their \\"phostint\\" process), and the Photochrom Company of London. Amongst the first commercial photographers to employ the technique were French photographer F√©lix Bonfils, British photographer Francis Frith and American photographer William Henry Jackson, all active in the 1880s. Farbige Reise, Paris biblioth√®ques, 2009, p. 41 The photochrom process was most popular in the 1890s, when true color photography was first developed but was still commercially impractical. In 1898 the US Congress passed the Private Mailing Card Act which let private publishers produce postcards. These could be mailed for one cent each, while the letter rate was two cents. Publishers created thousands of photochrom prints, usually of cities or landscapes, and sold them as postcards. In this format, photochrom reproductions became popular.Marc Walter & Sabine Arque, ‚ÄúThe World in 1900‚Äù, Thames & Hudson, 2007 contains about 300 well-reproduced photochromes from around the world. The Detroit Photographic Company reportedly produced as many as seven million photochrom prints in some years, and ten to thirty thousand different views were offered. After World War I, which ended the craze for collecting photochrom postcards, the chief use of the process was for posters and art reproductions. The last photochrom printer operated up to 1970. Process A tablet of lithographic limestone called a \\"litho stone\\" was coated with a light-sensitive surface composed of a thin layer of purified bitumen dissolved in benzene. A reversed halftone negative was then pressed against the coating and exposed to daylight (ten to thirty minutes in summer, up to several hours in winter), causing the bitumen to harden in proportion to the amount of light passing through each portion of the negative. Then a solvent such as turpentine was applied to remove the unhardened bitumen and retouch the tonal scale, strengthening or softening tones as required. Thus the image became imprinted on the stone in bitumen. Each tint was applied using a separate stone that bore the appropriate retouched image. The finished print was produced using at least six, but more commonly ten to fifteen, tint stones.

He became known for his pioneering works in several branches of geography, notably urban development in developing countries. He is considered the father of critical geography in Brazil. Santos was a recipient of the Vautrin Lud Prize, often seen as geography's equivalent of the Nobel Prize, and a posthumous recipient of the Pr√™mio An√≠sio Teixeira, awarded every five years by the Brazilian agency for the improvement of higher education personnel to distinguished contributors to research and development in Brazil. Biography Santos was born in Brotas de Maca√∫bas, Bahia, Brazil on May 3, 1926.http://www.ub.edu/geocrit/sn/sn-124a.htm Revista Scripta Nova - University of Barcelona His parents were elementary school teachers who home- schooled him. His Black paternal grandfather had been formerly enslaved. By the time Santos was eight, he was through with his elementary education. From 1934 to 1936, he lived in Alcoba√ßa, where he went to study French and \\"good manners\\". Santos taught geography and math to fellow high-school students in order to finance his pre-law in Salvador. He graduated in law from the Federal University of Bahia but decided not to practice, becoming instead a high- school geography teacher in Ilh√©us.http://www.ub.edu/geocrit/sn/sn-124a.htm Revista Scripta Nova - University of Barcelona There, he met and married his first wife Jandira, who gave birth to their son Milton filho. Also in Ilh√©us, Santos worked on the side as a journalist for the A Tarde newspaper. Santos studied and taught in Europe, the Americas, and Africa.http://www.ub.edu/geocrit/sn/sn-124a.htm Revista Scripta Nova - University of Barcelona He completed his PhD at the University of Strasbourg in 1958 under Jean Tricart. Prior to being exiled by the Brazilian military dictatorship, he was forbidden to leave the country and could do so only after a negotiation between the French ambassador and the government. He managed to turn an otherwise painful thirteen-year exile into a successful international career. He lived in Bordeaux and Toulouse, where he met geography student H√©l√®ne, who was to become his second wife and give birth to son Rafael. He also taught in Paris at the Sorbonne, Toronto and the MIT, where he teamed up with Noam Chomsky. Santos wrote more than forty books, all told, in several languages. His works became a reference for those interested in understanding geography from a critical point of view (if not necessarily in a negative light), especially by applying concepts of the Frankfurt School.http://www.ub.edu/geocrit/sn/sn-124a.htm Revista Scripta Nova - University of Barcelona His main concerns were connected on the one hand to city structure, urban networks and urbanisation processes in developing nations; and on the other hand, to the epistemology of geography (which means, its object and relationship to other sciences, such as economics and ethnography). His views about space helped geography transition from a concept of space as a stage for human action, to a constraint on human action. His works include \\"Por uma Geografia Nova\\" (For a New Geography) (1978) and \\"A natureza do espa√ßo\\" (The Nature of Space) (1996). His work \\"O espa√ßo dividido\\" (The Shared Space), in which Santos develops a theory of urban development in developing countries, is considered a geography classic. In 1994, Santos was awarded the Vautrin Lud Prize, the highest prize in geography. The Prize is modelled after the Nobel Prize and colloquially called the Nobel Prize for geography. To date, Santos remains the only Latin-American scholar to ever win it. Death Santos died in S√£o Paulo, on June 24, 2001, at age 75, as a result of prostate cancer diagnosed about seven years earlier.

Sunlight Soap ad in the trenches of WW I (1915) Sunlight is a brand of dishwashing detergent manufactured and marketed around the world by Unilever, except in the United States and Canada, where it has been owned by Sun Products (now Henkel Corporation) since 2010. History Sunlight household soap was introduced by the British company Lever Brothers in 1884. It was the world's first packaged, branded laundry soap. Designed for washing clothes and general household use, the success of the product led to the name for the company's village for its workers, Port Sunlight. The soap formula was invented by a Bolton chemist named William Hough Watson, who also became an early business partner. Watson's process created a new soap, using glycerin and vegetable oils such as palm oil rather than tallow (animal fats). William Lever and his brother James Darcy Lever invested in Watson's soap invention and its initial success came from offering bars of cut, wrapped, and branded soap in his father's grocery shop. This was an early labour-saving device for the housewife as prior to this, commercially made soap was bought in long bars. Sunlight soap was eventually supplanted by modern products made from synthetically produced detergents rather than naturally derived soaps. In 1971, the company rebranded Sunlight as a washing- up liquid in the UK. The new packaging for Sunlight Lemon Liquid had a large picture of a lemon, and only featured the words \\"washing up liquid\\" in small letters. There were complaints that children might mistake the product for lemon squash and drink it. The matter was discussed in the House of Lords. The company responded by changing its packaging. In several markets (e.g., Belgium and the Netherlands) Sunlight soap has survived as a personal wash product rather than a laundry detergent. Sunlight is still used in some markets as a brand by Unilever (the successor of Lever Brothers). In Sri Lanka, Sunlight laundry soap has a market share of more than 75%, and won the ‚Äúbrand of the year‚Äù award in 2004. In South Africa, the brand is used for bath soap, dishwashing liquid, washing powder and fabric conditioner. The brand was also used in the Philippines during the 1990s as detergents. It was discontinued until it was revived in 2015 as a liquid dish-washing detergent traded alongside the Surf line. However, production for Ireland and the UK ceased in 2009 due to low demand; it is available only as an import. In Norway it was taken over by Lilleborg in 1930. In 2003, exclusive licensing rights to the Sunlight brand for dishwashing detergents in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico were sold along with several Unilever brands to Lehman Brothers Merchant Banking Group, which established Phoenix Brands LLC for the purpose. In 2008, the North American trademark rights to Unilever laundry brands including Sunlight were acquired by Sun Products Corporation. In early 2010, Sun Products acquired the American and Canadian business rights to the Sunlight brand. Sun Products was itself acquired by Henkel North American Consumer Goods in 2016. The Sunlight brand was used by JohnsonDiversey Professional Products in Canada and the USA in 2011. In Australia, it is a brand of Symex, who manufacture, distribute and export Sunlight bar soap and Sunlight dishwashing liquid. In Turkey in the summer of 2010, washing-up liquids produced under the brand Cif began marketing with the new compound brand Sunlight Cif. As well as the regular liquid, a concentrated washing-up liquid was introduced in three varieties (lime, lemon and orange); when it comes into contact with water, it turns into a gel which remains in the sponge longer than regular washing-up liquid.

The terms Primary Phase and Secondary Phase describe the first two radio series of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, first broadcast in 1978. These were the first incarnations of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy franchise. Both were written by Douglas Adams and consist of six episodes each. The series followed the aimless wanderings of Arthur Dent, Ford Prefect and his book, the eponymous Guide. It introduced unfamiliar music, mind stretching concepts and the newest science mixed together with out of context parodies, unfeasibly rude names, \\"semantic and philosophical jokes\\", compressed prose and \\"groundbreaking deployment of sound effects and voice techniques\\". By the time the sixth episode was broadcast, the show had become a cult. A Christmas special would follow, many repeats and a second series. The two original series were followed by three more in 2004 and 2005. The following article is a list of episodes from the Primary and Secondary Phases. For information on its production, see The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The Primary Phase The first radio series was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in March and April 1978. It was split into episodes, known as \\"Fits\\" (an archaic term for a section of a poem revived by Lewis Carroll for The Hunting of the Snark). The original series comprised Fit the First to Fit the Sixth. Fits the Fifth and Sixth were co-written by John Lloyd; subsequent versions of the story omit most of Lloyd's material. The success of the series encouraged Adams to adapt it into a novel, which was based on the first four Fits and released in the second week of October 1979. A slightly contracted double LP re-recording of the first four Fits was released in the same year, followed by a single LP featuring a revised version of Fits the Fifth and Sixth and the second book, both in 1980. =Fit the First= *Broadcast on BBC Radio 4, 8 March 1978 10:30pm Cast :* The Book (narrator): Peter Jones :* Arthur Dent: Simon Jones :* Prosser and Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz (Vogon Captain): Bill Wallis :* Ford Prefect: Geoffrey McGivern :* Lady Cynthia Fitzmelton: Jo Kendall :* The Barman: David Gooderson As the episode opens Arthur Dent is attempting to prevent the local council, represented by Mr Prosser, from bulldozing his house to make way for a bypass. Dent's friend, Ford Prefect arrives and takes him to the pub. At the pub, Ford explains that he is not from Guildford after all, but from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse, and that the world is about to end. Meanwhile, Lady Cynthia Fitzmelton, a character unique to the radio series, has arrived at the site of Arthur Dent's house. She makes a speech about progress, and the future for the village of Cottington, and insults the residents in the process. She begins the construction of the bypass, and the demolition of Arthur Dent's house, by smashing a bottle of \\"very splendid and worthwhile\\" champagne against a yellow bulldozer. Ford and Arthur hear this, and Arthur races back to the former site of his house, Ford chasing after him after first buying some peanuts. Shortly after Arthur and Ford return to the ruins of Arthur's house, a fleet of Vogon Constructor Ships arrives in the sky, and Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz broadcasts an announcement that they are to demolish the Earth to make way for a hyperspace bypass. Panic ensues. Ford uses his \\"electronic thumb\\" to hitch a lift onto one of the ships, taking Arthur with him, just moments before the Earth is destroyed. On board the Vogon Constructor Ship, Ford explains that he was a field researcher for the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and had been stuck on the Earth for several more years than he originally expected. The two are soon captured by the Vogons, who take an unfriendly view of hitchhikers. The episode ends on a cliffhanger, after the Vogon Captain tortures them by reading them some poetry, with them due to be thrown into space afterwards.

They attempt to flatter him to avoid execution, but he decides to throw them off the ship anyway. Whilst being escorted to the airlock, Ford attempts to persuade the Vogon guard to give up his job, but fails. The pair are thrown into space. Improbably, they are rescued after 29 seconds, by a starship. After some more improbable events they discover they have been picked up by the Starship Heart of Gold, which has been stolen by Ford's semi-cousin, and President of the Galaxy, Zaphod Beeblebrox. The Heart of Gold works on a basis of infinite improbability, allowing its drive to do anything for which the improbability factor is known. Also on the Heart of Gold are Trillian (Tricia McMillan), whom Arthur met at a party in Islington, before she left the party (and the planet) to go with Zaphod Beeblebrox, and Marvin, a depressed android. The episode ends with a post-credit announcement from Eddie the Shipboard Computer that the ship is moving into orbit around the legendary planet of Magrathea.

Due to its immense success, Magrathea became the richest planet in the galaxy and the galactic economy collapsed. Ford and Zaphod argue about the accuracy of this legend, Ford believing that it is nonsense, Zaphod believing he has found the long-lost planet. As the ship orbits the planet, it triggers an automated recorded message, from the Commercial Council of Magrathea, that notes that Magrathea is currently closed for business, and to leave. A follow-up message announces that nuclear missiles will be launched against the ship. The missiles are detected, and the crew struggle to get the Heart of Gold to escape the missiles. Disaster is averted when Arthur activates the Infinite Improbability Drive and the missiles are turned into a bowl of petunias and a very surprised-looking sperm whale. Trillian notes that her white mice (that she had taken with her from the Earth) have escaped. The ship lands, and Ford, Arthur, Zaphod, Trillian and Marvin go onto the surface. (The episode, as released on CD, is edited here to avoid possible musical copyright concerns. ) They split up, and Zaphod, Trillian and Ford explore a tunnel, noting that they seem to be following the mice, whilst Arthur and Marvin are left on the surface as lookout. Eventually, Slartibartfast comes to meet Arthur, and takes him into the interior of the planet, leaving Marvin behind. Inside Magrathea, he shows Arthur a planet that they are working on at the moment. Arthur recognises it as the Earth. Slartibartfast explains that the original Earth had been destroyed five minutes too early, and they are constructing a replacement. The original Earth had apparently been commissioned by some mice in order to find the \\"Ultimate Question\\". Notes: First appearance of Slartibartfast.

He plays Arthur some recordings explaining the historical events. This race of pan-dimensional beings had constructed a great computer, called Deep Thought, to answer the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything. It did, after seven and a half million years, have the answer to the Ultimate Question, a rather disappointing 42. Deep Thought explains that this is only disappointing because they never really understood what the Question was. They ask the computer if he can find out what the Ultimate Question is. Deep Thought cannot, but promises to design a computer that can, and names it, \\"Earth\\". Slartibartfast explains that this computer was built by the Magratheans, and that the Vogons came and destroyed it five minutes before it was due to complete its run. The mice summon Arthur and Slartibartfast to a meeting room, where they have discussed a proposal with Zaphod, Ford and Trillian. The mice believe that as last-generation products of the computer matrix, Arthur and Trillian should be in an ideal position to find out the Question, and offer to make them \\"extremely rich\\" if they can do so. (In later versions this would be replaced with the mice wishing to extract Arthur's brain). The negotiations are interrupted by the arrival of a Galactic Police ship, pursuing Zaphod for his theft of the Heart of Gold. The Police confront Arthur, Ford, Trillian and Zaphod, and shoot at them, whilst explaining that they find violence upsetting. After a particularly long volley of fire, the computer bank they are hiding behind explodes, and the episode ends.

Arthur, Ford, Trillian and Zaphod wake up in a strange place, and assume it must be the afterlife. It becomes apparent however that in fact it is Milliways, the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, which is located in the far future at the moment that the universe ends. They dine, but are interrupted by a telephone call from Marvin. A waiter explains that the Restaurant was in fact constructed in the ruins of Magrathea. Meanwhile, Marvin has been waiting on the surface of the planet. After he whines somewhat, the four go down to the car park (where Marvin has been parking cars), and meet up with Marvin. Ford and Zaphod are transfixed by the spaceships in the carpark, and discover a totally black, totally frictionless ship. Stuck without the Heart of Gold, they decide to steal it, with Marvin's help. When on the ship, they discover that it is out of control, and since the interior is also totally black none of the controls are legible. They debate what the Question is, and Marvin reveals that he can read it in Arthur's brainwave patterns. Before he can reveal what it is, they are interrupted by the control panels lighting up suddenly and the ship coming out of hyperspace. They realise they are outside of the galaxy, and part of an intergalactic battle fleet.

Soon, they receive a transmission from the second-in-command of the battle fleet, who makes a report to Zaphod, believing him to be the Admiral. This is considered confusing as Zaphod was just presumed to be the Admiral, despite bearing no resemblance to the second-in- command, who looked like a leopard. Shortly afterward, they receive another transmission, this time with Trillian in the chair. The second-in-command, who now looks like a shoebox, assumes that Trillian is the Admiral. They look up the name \\"Haggunenon\\", spoken by the second-in-command, in the Guide, and discover that they are a race of xenophobic shape-shifters. They realise that the Admiral is in fact on the ship, but had shapeshifted. It becomes a \\"carbon copy\\" of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal. The group split up, Arthur and Ford taking one escape capsule and Zaphod and Trillian attempting to take another. Arthur notices that the other escape capsule isn't escaping, and presses a button in his escape capsule that ends up teleporting him and Ford to a strange spaceship. Meanwhile, Zaphod, Trillian and Marvin are all eaten by the copy of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal, with Marvin's leg coming off in the process, and Zaphod's second head is revealed to know French (via an ad-lib by Mark Wing-Davey). This is the last appearance of the character of Trillian until the Tertiary Phase. The spaceship to which Ford and Arthur have teleported, marked as \\"Golgafrincham Ark Fleet, Ship B\\" is filled with bodies, such as frozen telephone sanitisers, hairdressers, and advertising account executives. Whilst inspecting the bodies, they are captured by Number Two, the third-in-command of the ship, who takes them to the bridge. Here, they meet the Captain (who is taking a bath in a large bathtub in the bridge, and has been for several years). He reluctantly grants permission to Number Two to interrogate Arthur and Ford, and asks him to find out what they want to drink. Conversing with the Captain, they discover that the bodies are not, as they believed, dead, but frozen. They are intending to colonise another planet, because their original planet was \\"doomed\\". The \\"A Ark\\" was supposed to contain leaders, the \\"C Ark\\" to contain workers, and the \\"B Ark\\" to contain middle-men. It becomes apparent that the stories of impending doom were nonsense, and the A Ark and C Ark were never launched. The story resumes some months later, with a meeting of the Colonisation Committee. Reports to the Committee include an update on the development of the wheel (it is unclear what colour it should be), and a documentary about the native cave- men of the planet, who have started to die out since the arrival of the Golgafrinchams. Ford explains that they had done some research on the planet, and that it will last only two million years (but not why - because it is the pre-history of the Earth, and is thus due to be destroyed by the Vogons in two million years time). Arthur attempts to teach the cave-men Scrabble, in order to try to stop the Golgafrinchams supplanting them. The cave-man spells out \\"FORTY TWO\\" on the scrabble board, and Ford and Arthur realise that the program must have gone wrong because of the arrival of the Golgafrinchams. They decide to use the same technique (of choosing scrabble letters) randomly to find out what the question in Arthur's brainwave patterns is, although it might be wrong anyway. The question in his brain is revealed as \\"WHAT DO YOU GET IF YOU MULTIPLY SIX BY NINE\\". The episode ends as they decide to rejoin the Golgafrincham colony, and lament the inevitable eventual destruction of the Earth.

Perkins (ed.) Additional material by M.J. Simpson. Page 147. Five further episodes, to complete the second series (later retitled \\"The Secondary Phase\\") were commissioned in May 1979. These final five episodes (the last on radio until 2004) were 'stripped,' or broadcast on each of five days in a single week in January 1980.Simpson. Page 41. Trillian is entirely missing from this series. Her fate is addressed in Fit the Seventh, that she had effected an escape but had then been forcibly married to the President of the Algolian chapter of the Galactic Rotary Club. The character returns in The Tertiary Phase, where she dismisses most of the events of the Secondary Phase as having been one of Zaphod's \\"psychotic episodes.\\" =Fit the Seventh= *Broadcast on BBC Radio 4, 24 December 1978 Cast :* The Book: Peter Jones :* Arthur Dent: Simon Jones :* Ford Prefect/Frogstar Robot/Air Traffic Controller: Geoffrey McGivern :* Zaphod Beeblebrox: Mark Wing-Davey :* Marvin the Paranoid Android and Gag Halfrunt: Stephen Moore :* Arcturan Number One: Bill Paterson :* Arcturan Captain/Radio Voice/Receptionist/Lift: David Tate :* Roosta: Alan Ford :* Announcer (uncredited): John Marsh The episode opens in the Hitchhiker's offices on Ursa Minor Beta, with a receptionist claiming that Zarniwoop, the editor of the guide, is too busy to take a call because he is both in his office, and on an intergalactic cruise. It then moves to the bridge of a megafreighter that is due to land on Ursa Minor Beta. A crewmember denounces the Hitchhiker's Guide for being soft, and notes that he has heard they have created a whole artificial universe. Zaphod Beeblebrox is a hitch- hiker on the freighter, and as he listens to the radio, he hears a report that he has died, by being eaten by a Haggunenon. The manner of his escape is left unclear. Meanwhile, Arthur and Ford are stuck in Earth's pre-history, drunk. As they discuss their predicament, they notice a spaceship half-appearing in front of them. They celebrate their rescue, and it vanishes. Eventually they deduce that this is a time paradox, and they need to figure out how to signal the ship in the future so they can be rescued. Following this is the Guide's entry on the subject of towels, making its first appearance. On the ship, Zaphod explains to the crewmember that he is going to Ursa Minor Beta to find out what he's doing. He received a message from himself the previous night, telling him to see Zarniwoop in order to learn something to his disadvantage. Zaphod then explains how he escaped - the Haggunenon turned into an escape capsule before it got the chance to eat him. Zaphod arrives at the Hitchhiker's offices, and demands to see Zarniwoop, but is given the same excuses as before. After revealing his identity, he is directed to Zarniwoop's office, and meets up with Marvin, who had also survived and coincidentally arrived at the same place. After Marvin persuades the lift to take them upwards, the building starts to shake, due to it being bombed. Zaphod is met by Roosta, who blames the bombing on Zaphod failing to conceal his presence on the planet adequately. A Frogstar Robot class D soon arrives to come and get Zaphod. Zaphod orders Marvin to stop it (which he does, by tricking it into destroying the floor it is standing on), whilst Zaphod and Roosta escape into the pocket universe in Zarniwoop's office. From the perspective of the three later radio series, all of the subsequent events of the Secondary Phase occur only in Zarniwoop's artificial universe, and not in the 'real' universe. They are later dismissed by Trillian as \\"psychotic episodes.\\" Eventually, the Frogstar Robots decide to take the entire building back to the Frogstar. =Fit the Eighth= *Broadcast on BBC Radio 4, 21 January 1980 Cast :* The Book: Peter Jones :* Zaphod Beeblebrox: Mark Wing-Davey :* Roosta: Alan Ford :* Frogstar Prisoner Relations Officer/Eddie the Computer: David Tate :* Arthur Dent: Simon Jones :* Ford Prefect: Geoffrey McGivern :* Gargravarr: Valentine Dyall :* Announcer (uncredited): John Marsh The episode opens with Zaphod and Roosta in the Guide building, which is being towed to the Frogstar, \\"the most totally evil place in the Galaxy\\". Roosta explains that they are going to feed Zaphod to the \\"Total Perspective Vortex\\", which no one has ever survived. A Frogstar Prisoner Relations Officer teleports in, to taunt Zaphod. Meanwhile, in Earth's past, Ford and Arthur are still dealing with the rescue ship that has half-appeared in front of them. Rather stuck for how to signal it, they wave a towel at it, and surprisingly, the spaceship appears to notice this and lands rather catastrophically, trapping them under a boulder, and sending the towel into a lava flow. They appear to be stuck, so they ask The Guide what to do if one is stuck under a rock, with no hope of rescue. The guide has an entry that begins, 'Consider how lucky you are that life has been good to you so far...' However, it becomes apparent that the boulder they are under is actually the ship, the Heart of Gold, and Zaphod Beeblebrox comes out of it, rather the worse for wear. He explains that he has been put in the Total Perspective Vortex, and survived. After this, he celebrated and is hungover from a week's celebration. He explains that the towel had been fossilised, and when the Earth was blown up two million years later, the Improbability Drive picked it up. The story then continues in flashback, picking up with Zaphod and Roosta on the Guide building. They attempt to escape with a \\"body debit\\" (teleport) card, but are foiled by the Relations Officer. He then tricks Zaphod into signing a consent form for entering the Vortex, and is then teleported to the service. He meets Gargravarr, a disembodied voice, the guardian of the Vortex. He is then placed in it, and exposed to its action, which is to place the user into Total Perspective by showing, with unfiltered perception, themselves in relation to the universe, for a moment. Zaphod survives, much to the astonishment of Gargravarr. He reports that it showed him that he is a \\"really great guy\\". =Fit the Ninth= *Broadcast on BBC Radio 4, 22 January 1980 Cast :* The Book: Peter Jones :* Arthur Dent: Simon Jones :* Ford Prefect/Ventilation System: Geoffrey McGivern :* Zaphod Beeblebrox: Mark Wing-Davey :* Vogon Captain: Bill Wallis :* Marvin the Paranoid Android/Vogon Guard/Gag Halfrunt: Stephen Moore :* Eddie the Computer/Vogon Guard/Vogon Computer: David Tate :* Nutrimat Machine: Leueen Willoughby :* Zaphod Beeblebrox IV: Richard Goolden :* Announcer (uncredited): John Marsh :* One of the singing robots (uncredited): Geoffrey Perkins :* Another of the singing robots (uncredited): Paddy Kingsland The episode opens with Ford and Arthur discussing Zaphod's sanity on board the Heart of Gold. Ford also starts correcting Arthur's grammar, forcing Arthur to refer to Earth in the past tense, as it had been demolished in Fit the First. Ford then begins to question the reason given for the demolition, stating \\"that was all done away with centuries ago. No one demolishes planets anymore.\\" Ford has noticed another fleet of Vogon ships following the Heart of Gold at a distance of five light years for half an hour. He then calls for Marvin to bring Zaphod to the bridge. Meanwhile, Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz confirms the identity of the ship and its occupants, then proceeds to wipe out half his crew in a fit of rage. After this massacre, he contacts Gag Halfrunt. Halfrunt is revealed not only to be Jeltz's psychiatrist (as well as Zaphod's), but also the psychiatrist who originally hired Jeltz to destroy first the Earth, then any survivors. Jeltz is asked to hold off on his final destruction of the Heart of Gold until Halfrunt can make an arrangement for fees still owed by Zaphod. Halfrunt contacts Zaphod, who has since arrived on the Heart of Gold's bridge, but refuses to see the Vogon threat as anything more than a delusion of grandeur. Zaphod destroys the Heart of Gold's radio, then attempts to get the ship's computer to engage the Infinite Improbability Drive in order to get the Heart of Gold away from the Vogons. The computer states that this is not possible, as all its circuits have become busy with another task, and insists that the result will be something they can all \\"Share and Enjoy.\\" The Guide explains that \\"Share and Enjoy\\" is the motto of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Complaints Division. A song, sung by the company's robots, with voices a flattened fifth out of tune, is heard. Another product of SCC that never works, the Nutrimat, is introduced, as Arthur is attempting to get it to dispense tea. Arthur eventually converses with the Nutrimat, the floor and the ventilation system, trying to convince them that he wants tea, when Eddie the ship's computer is finally brought in, to work out \\"why the human prefers boiled leaves to everything we have to offer him....\\" This is then revealed to be the problem preventing the computer from evading the Vogons. Zaphod decides to contact his great-grandfather, Zaphod Beeblebrox IV, through a seance. More background behind Zaphod's actual job and a conspiracy to discover the real ruler of the universe is revealed. As the episode ends, Eddie has been restored to normal function, and engages the IID, getting the ship out of firing range of the Vogons in the nick of time. =Fit the Tenth= *Broadcast on BBC Radio 4, 23 January 1980 Cast :* The Book: Peter Jones :* Arthur Dent: Simon Jones :* Ford Prefect: Geoffrey McGivern :* Zaphod Beeblebrox: Mark Wing-Davey :* Eddie the Computer: David Tate :* Marvin the Paranoid Android: Stephen Moore :* Bird One: Ronald Baddiley :* Bird Two and Footwarrior: John Baddeley :* The Wise Old Bird: John Le Mesurier :* Lintilla: Rula Lenska :* Announcer (uncredited): John Marsh The episode opens with more background material on Arthur Dent, specifically how the \\"remarkably unremarkable\\" human from Earth had an effect on the war between the G'Gugvunts and Vl'Hurgs, and will now have further significance on the planet Brontitall, where the Heart of Gold has just arrived. Zaphod and Ford discuss their arrival in a cave with Eddie the computer, noting the cold. Eddie calculates after they, and Arthur and Marvin, have departed the ship, that they are thirteen miles above ground level, despite there not being any mountains on the planet. The four begin to explore the cave. Shortly, Arthur falls out of the cave mouth. Zaphod nearly falls as well, but catches the lip of the cave mouth, then discovers for himself that they are \\"miles up in the air.\\" Ford talks to Zaphod while the latter dangles. Meanwhile, Arthur has managed to fall onto a large passing bird. The bird reveals that the \\"cave\\" is actually a mile long marble sculpture of a plastic cup, hanging in the sky, part of a larger statue. The bird flies Arthur to the main statue, which is known as \\"Arthur Dent Throwing the Nutrimatic Cup.\\" Arthur then reveals himself to be the very person that the statue is modeled after, and the bird flies into the statue's right ear, where the rest of his kind live. Arthur meets them, and their leader, the Wise Old Bird, and learns a few things about the past of Brontitall. For example, the statue was built in Arthur's honour after his argument with the Nutrimat Machine inspired them to rid themselves of the \\"blight of the robots\\". There is one thing the birds refuse to speak of, however, and the Wise Old Bird tells Arthur, \\"if you want to know, you will have to descend to the ground....\\" The Guide mentions how little is still considered to be unspeakable in the galaxy, except for the rudest word in existence: \\"Belgium\\". Zaphod uses this word to finally convince Ford to attempt a rescue, still dangling from the lip of the mile-long cup. The attempt fails, and both of them fall out of the cup, and onto another passing bird. On the surface, Arthur encounters a Footwarrior, who has declared the planet of Brontitall to be the property of the Dolmansaxlil Galactic Shoe Corporation.A portmanteau of the names of the British shoe companies Dolcis, Manfield, Saxone and Lilley. Fleeing the Footwarrior, Arthur takes refuge in a trench with an archaeologist named Lintilla, who tells Arthur that she's on Brontitall to discover why the Footwarriors are all limping due to blisters, as the episode ends. =Fit the Eleventh= *Broadcast on BBC Radio 4, 24 January 1980 Cast :* The Book: Peter Jones :* Arthur Dent: Simon Jones :* Lintilla (and two clones): Rula Lenska :* Ford Prefect: Geoffrey McGivern :* Zaphod Beeblebrox: Mark Wing-Davey :* Bird and Footwarrior: John Baddeley :* Hig Hurtenflurst: Marc Smith :* Film Commentator and Computeach: David Tate :* Pupil and Marvin the Paranoid Android: Stephen Moore :* Announcer (uncredited): John Marsh After a brief recap, the episode opens with a conversation between Lintilla and Arthur. Lintilla mentions that she's an archaeologist, stranded on Brontitall, as her spaceship was disabled. She activates her crisis inducer, and leads Arthur through a set of tunnels. While they're running, the narrator describes the state of medical science in the universe, with artificially induced injuries. Meanwhile, Zaphod and Ford have landed on the back of one of the birds from the previous episode, and eventually convince it to reach the ground by wrapping Ford's towel around its eyes. But because the bird had to reach the ground, it and its fellow birds are upset, and start attacking Zaphod and Ford on the surface. A loud noise occurs, which causes the narrator to explain its lack of immediate context. Arthur emerges from a tunnel behind Lintilla, who had overcompensated for her artificially induced crisis. Lintilla introduces Arthur to two of her \\"sisters\\" (actually clones), and they begin discussing the noise, finally establishing a context for it. Lintilla finally admits that there are 578,000,000,000 clones of herself in the universe. The narrator explains how this happened, and what is being done about it. Lintilla takes Arthur to the shaft suddenly created after the mysterious loud noise, and they finally confirm what the three Lintillas had been looking for: \\"An entire archaeological layer of compressed shoes.\\" After making this confirmation, they are captured by Hig Hurtenflurst, a Dolmansaxlil Shoe Corporation executive. The narrator finally describes what made the noise and created the shaft that gave the Lintillas their breakthrough. It's none other than Marvin, who himself finally fell out of the cup that the Heart of Gold is parked in. He's lying at the bottom of a mile deep shaft, and goes \\"zootlewurdle.\\" Meanwhile, Hig has decided to take Lintilla and Arthur back to his office. Hig explains the background of what happened to Brontitall - they fell victim to a Dolmansaxlil Shoe Shop Intensifier Ray, forcing them to construct nothing but shoe shops, and selling nothing but badly made shoes. Arthur learns that Earth was to be one of the next targets, spared from this by being demolished by the Vogons. The film being shown to Arthur and Lintilla explaining the Shoe Shop Intensifier Ray is suddenly interrupted, as is power to the office, when Marvin decides to rescue Arthur and Lintilla, and her two clones. The narrator then explains that the Shoe Shop Intensifier Ray was unnecessary, that a \\"Shoe Event Horizon\\" would have occurred on that planet, and many other worlds, as part of their natural economic histories. A lesson from the future is heard, explaining this principle. Lintilla, Arthur and Marvin continue their escape, while Ford and Zaphod finally arrive at a large, very old building, and enter it to take shelter from the still angry bird people. They discover that the building is a spaceport, and find abandoned ships left inside it. One such ship is still connected to supply lines, and still has power. Zaphod makes himself a stethoscope (for both heads), and holds it to the hull of this ship. He's stunned by what he hears inside, and here the episode ends. =Fit the Twelfth= *Broadcast on BBC Radio 4, 25 January 1980 Cast :* The Book: Peter Jones :* Arthur Dent: Simon Jones :* Ford Prefect and Varntvar The Priest: Geoffrey McGivern :* Zaphod Beeblebrox: Mark Wing-Davey :* Lintillas and Android Stewardess: Rula Lenska :* The Allitnils: David Tate :* Poodoo: Ken Campbell :* Autopilot and Zarniwoop: Jonathan Pryce :* Marvin the Paranoid Android and The Man in the Shack: Stephen Moore :* Announcer (uncredited): John Marsh The episode begins with a reprise of the action from Fit the Eleventh: Ford and Zaphod have discovered a derelict spaceport, including one ship, still intact, with its supply lines still connected, and still having power. Zaphod creates a stethoscope for both heads out of some pieces of tubing, and is shocked at what he hears inside. Ford asks to listen, and finally, everyone gets to hear an android stewardess making an announcement about their delayed space flight. Zaphod calculates that the ship is in fact over 900 years late. Ford and Zaphod agree to find their way into the ship to investigate further. Meanwhile, Arthur and Lintilla finally find Lintilla's two clones on Brontitall, but they, along with Marvin, are discovered by the Footwarriors as power is restored. Arthur agrees to run down the corridor while the others lay down cover fire with \\"a gun of some sort\\", then Arthur will have them throw the gun to him, so that he can lay down cover fire while they run to meet him. As Arthur completes the first part of this task, he's met by a man named Poodoo, a priest named Varntvar, and three men named Allitnil. During this confusion, Arthur manages to get Lintilla to throw the gun down the corridor, and starts firing to cover their run to join him. While Arthur does this, Poodoo is explaining how keen he is to introduce the Allitnils to the Lintillas, for a quiet social evening, and \\"a priest [is] on hand in case anybody wants to get married at all. Just to round off the evening.\\" Arthur questions his sanity. The Lintillas finally join Arthur, and Poodoo seizes his opportunity to introduce the Allitnils to them. They are immediately overwhelmingly attracted to each other, but are warned off from kissing each other until married. The priest is then called upon to perform three weddings. As the weddings conclude and the men kiss their brides, two of the three pairs disappear in \\"a puff of unsmoke\\" as Arthur discovers that the marriage certificates are actually cloning machine company \\"Agreements to Cease to Be\\" and cries out, stopping the final couple from kissing. At this point, we go back to Ford and Zaphod entering the very late space ship, just as the passengers are being woken from suspended animation for coffee and biscuits. Ford and Zaphod flee the scene, eventually arriving on the flight deck, where they are continually ordered by the autopilot to return to their seats. The autopilot argues with them over the statistical likelihood of another civilisation delivering the lemon soaked paper napkins required by the spaceship before it can depart, and Ford and Zaphod flee again, this time to the First Class compartment. Here, a man introduces himself to Zaphod as Zarniwoop, whom Zaphod had been seeking since Fit the Seventh. The action returns to Arthur, the remaining Lintilla, and Marvin. We learn that Arthur had killed the last Allitnil, the anti-clone, and Marvin tied up Poodoo and Varntvar, leaving them forced to listen to a cassette tape of Marvin's autobiography. As they finally exit the Dolmansaxlil building, they set out for the same spaceport that Ford and Zaphod are in, but then discover that the suspended cup is heading towards the surface, with the Heart of Gold still inside. Meanwhile, Zarniwoop has offered Ford and Zaphod some drinks, and attempts to explain the whole situation to them. Zarniwoop starts by explaining that they had been in an artificially created universe within his office, then explains that he and Zaphod had co-conspired to discover who was really ruling the galaxy, as it was obvious it wasn't the President. Zaphod succeeds in his task, bringing the Heart of Gold - its improbability drive being necessary to reach the realm of the real ruler of the galaxy - to Zarniwoop's hiding place. Zarniwoop begins \\"dismantling\\" the artificial universe, and causes the cup to head to the surface outside. After the narrator describes who might be ruling the universe, we hear the voice of an old man attempting to feed his cat a bit of fish. This old man seems to have his own unique perspective on things, but had noticed a white ship approaching. This ship, the Heart of Gold, discharges four of its passengers: Ford, Zaphod, Arthur and Zarniwoop, who approach the old man's shack. They attempt to question him about the decisions he makes about the galaxy, but he gives everything a vague answer. He does however reveal that he may have given his assent to the men who regularly seek his advice, thus giving Zaphod permission, under the pressure of the galaxy's psychiatrists, to destroy Earth before the Ultimate Question was revealed, thus securing their jobs. Arthur leaves angrily. Zarniwoop attempts further questions, but is eventually brushed off, and it's discovered that Arthur has made away with the Heart of Gold, with Lintilla and Marvin aboard. This leaves Ford, Zaphod and Zarniwoop stranded on the \\"Old Man in the Shack\\"'s planet, and here the episode ends - though open-ended with a spoken possibility of another series. Casting in both series As the first episode was originally commissioned as a pilot, much of the casting was done by Adams and Simon Brett, his original radio producer. Brett departed the BBC after the pilot episode was recorded, and so casting suggestions and decisions were made by Adams and Geoffrey Perkins for the remainder of both series. Perkins, using Brett's original notes, remarks that three or four people were auditioned for the part of the narrator, in search of a \\"Peter Jones-y sort of voice\\" before Peter Jones himself was actually contacted.Adams. Perkins (ed.) Additional material by M.J. Simpson. Page 32. Perkins also describes the casting of Simon Jones, Geoffrey McGivern, Jo Kendall, Bill Wallis and many others throughout the book containing the original radio series scripts. Adams's own notes on the casting of Peter Jones (\\"who can we get to do a Peter Jonesey voice?\\"), Stephen Moore (\\"Stephen would find the character immediately and would make it really excellent\\"), Mark Wing-Davey (\\"He played a guy [in The Glittering Prizes] who took advantage of people and was very trendy\\"), David Tate (\\"He was one of the backbones of the series. We had him there every week\\"), Richard Vernon (\\"He's so funny. He carved himself a niche playing all sort of grandfatherly types\\"), Susan Sheridan (\\"Susan never found anything major to do with the role, but that wasn't her fault, it was my fault\\") and Roy Hudd (\\"To this day he still claims he doesn't know what it was all about\\") can be found in Neil Gaiman's book Don't Panic: The Official Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy Companion.

These radio series consisted of a total of twenty episodes, following on from the twelve episodes from the original two series (the Primary and Secondary Phases) which originally aired in 1978 and 1980. The producers chose not to continue the ordinal sequence established by the Primary, Secondary and Tertiary phases. If they had done so, the fourth, fifth and sixth series would have been termed quaternary, quinary and senary. Humorously, they chose \\"Quandary\\", which means \\"dilemma\\", \\"Quintessential\\", which today means \\"the most perfect example of something\\" (although the original meaning of quintessential was \\"fifth element\\"), and \\"Hexagonal\\", which refers to something else entirely. The Tertiary Phase The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: Tertiary Phase, based on Life, the Universe and Everything, ran on BBC Radio 4 from Tuesday 21 September to 26 October 2004, with repeats on the following Thursdays. Episodes were subtitled \\"Fit the Thirteenth\\" through \\"Fit the Eighteenth\\". The third novel was adapted by Dirk Maggs, John Langdon and Bruce Hyman following instructions left by Adams. Most of the original radio series cast returned, with the exception of three, due to their deaths: Richard Vernon (died 1997) as Slartibartfast, replaced by Richard Griffiths; Peter Jones (died 2000), replaced by his friend William Franklyn, with some brief excerpts from Jones' original narration used in disguised as the Book's speech-generation system changing as part of updates to the Guide from the publisher; David Tate (died 1996), who played a multitude of minor roles in the two original radio series including Eddie, the Heart of Gold's computer. Bill Wallis, who played the roles of Mr Prosser and Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz in the original series, was not available. Toby Longworth took the role of Jeltz in the new series. On the other hand, John Marsh, who was the original series' continuity announcer, returned to announce the credits. There was even a cameo role by Adams himself (who had died in 2001) as Agrajag, edited from his BBC audiobook recording of the novel. The original novel was based on a treatment that Adams wrote for an unmade Doctor Who movie, Doctor Who and the Krikkitmen. The idea was re- proposed during Tom Baker's tenure in the title role, and again for a potential (but unmade) second television series of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Before the final episode was broadcast, BBC Worldwide released the Tertiary Phase on CD, including additional material. A DVD of the series was released on 2 October 2006 in the UK. This marks the first commercial release of any BBC radio programme in a 5.1 surround mix. The disc contains as extras: the full version of the Krikkit Song, a photogallery, the original online and radio trailers, the appearance of the series on Pick of the Week, and thirty minutes of behind the scenes video in five short segments. Note that while the BBC online shop is still listing the disc as a DVD-Audio disc, their own image confirms that the disc is a lower-definition standard DVD-Video.BBCshop.com online listing, accessed 19 September 2006 . Since the opening of the third book starts at the same place and time (prehistoric Earth) as the opening of the second radio series, the entire Secondary Phase was dismissed as one of Zaphod's \\"psychotic episodes\\" (including events that did take place in the books). Hints, however, were interspersed in the subsequent fourth and fifth series that would ultimately tie all five together. The UK edition of the novel was used for the adaptation‚Äîthis becomes evident in Fit the Sixteenth, when the \\"Rory\\" award is said to be given for the Most Gratuitous Use Of The Word Fuck In A Serious Screenplay. The US edition of the same novel substituted \\"Belgium\\" for \\"fuck\\", as well as the explanation for why the former word is considered to be devastatingly rude in the rest of the galaxy, which is drawn from Fit the Tenth of the Secondary Phase. The broadcast version avoids saying \\"fuck\\" on radio by well-timed crashes and explosions‚Äîthe CD version moves these so that the \\"fuck\\" is audible. =Fit the Thirteenth= *Broadcast on BBC Radio 4, 21 September 2004 :Cast: :* The Book: Peter Jones and William Franklyn :* Arthur Dent: Simon Jones :* Wowbagger (and Vogon Captain, uncredited): Toby Longworth :* Ford Prefect: Geoffrey McGivern :* Trillian: Susan Sheridan :* Zaphod Beeblebrox: Mark Wing-Davey :* Marvin the Paranoid Android: Stephen Moore :* Eddie the Computer: Roger Gregg :* Zem the Mattress: Andy Taylor :* Announcer: John Marsh Arthur wakes up in a cave on pre-historic Earth (thus ignoring the events of the Secondary Phase), on the day, four years after he last saw Ford Prefect, that Ford arrives back. Ford carries news that he has detected disturbances in the \\"space-time wash\\", and that they might be able to escape. The disturbance turns out to be an old sofa, which materialises in a field. They chase the sofa as it runs off, and then are transported elsewhere. Zaphod and Trillian are on the Heart of Gold, without Marvin. Zaphod is extremely hung over, and upset that Trillian is dismissing the events of The Secondary Phase as a \\"psychotic episode\\". Trillian wishes to do something and is getting increasingly annoyed at Zaphod. After preparing a fabulous meal, and Zaphod still refusing to come out of the bathroom, she teleports away, telling the ship to \\"transport me the hell out of Zaphod Beeblebrox's life.\\" Meanwhile, Marvin is on a swamp on Sqornshellous Zeta, conversing with the native life-forms, mattresses. He is circling around and around on one leg, while his artificial (i.e. replacement) leg is stuck in the swamp. =Fit the Fourteenth= *Broadcast on BBC Radio 4, 28 September 2004 :Cast: :* The Book: William Franklyn :* Arthur Dent: Simon Jones :* Ford Prefect: Geoffrey McGivern :* Marvin the Paranoid Android: Stephen Moore :* Krikkit Robots: Dominic Hawksley :* Slartibartfast: Richard Griffiths :* Zem the Mattress: Andy Taylor :* Walkie Talkie: Fiona Carew :* The Boy: Theo Maggs :* Wowbagger: Toby Longworth :* Deodat: Bruce Hyman :* Henry Blofeld: Himself :* Fred Trueman: Himself :* Announcer: John Marsh Arthur and Ford arrive at Lord's Cricket Ground on the sofa that they had caught in the previous episode. They have arrived in the final Test Match in the Ashes, in the middle of the field. A policeman apprehends them, and they retire to the pavilion. Watching the match, Arthur drinks some tea and glances upon a newspaper. He notices the date on the newspaper, and realises that it was from the day before the Earth was demolished. A ball lands in Arthur's bag, and when the fielder comes to collect it, Arthur decides to keep it. With the planet about to be demolished again, they then look for another lift from the planet. They discover a spaceship, hidden by a \\"Somebody Else's Problem field\\", hidden behind a screen. The game finishes, with England winning the Ashes, and Slartibartfast joins Arthur and Ford. Slartibartfast explains that he has arrived because \\"something terrible is about to happen\\". He walks to the centre of the cricket pitch, and asks to be given the Ashes saying that they are \\"vitally important for the past, present and future safety of the Galaxy\\". Another spaceship arrives. Eleven white robots, carrying bats, and wearing rocket pads on their shins (dressed like cricketers), come suddenly out, and start attacking the spectators and players with their bats, using them to hit grenade-like explosives at the humans present. They take the Ashes, say \\"we declare\\", and go back into their ship. Ford and Arthur catch a lift with Slartibartfast on his ship. Meanwhile, Marvin is once again making conversation with a mattress. A similar ship to before arrives, and white robots get out and take Marvin's one remaining leg. After a brief while, they return and decide to take all of Marvin instead. =Fit the Fifteenth= *Broadcast on BBC Radio 4, 5 October 2004 :Cast: :* The Book: William Franklyn :* Arthur Dent: Simon Jones :* Ford Prefect: Geoffrey McGivern :* Slartibartfast: Richard Griffiths :* Zaphod Beeblebrox: Mark Wing-Davey :* Wikkit Voice: Dominic Hawksley :* Agrajag: Douglas Adams :* Eddie the Computer: Roger Gregg :* Judiciary Pag: Rupert Degas :* Krikkit Man One (and Mancunian Correcting-Fluid Magnate, uncredited): Michael Fenton Stevens :* Krikkit Man Two (and Krikkit song by): Philip Pope :* Krikkit Man Three: Tom Maggs :* Henry Blofeld: Himself :* Fred Trueman: Himself :* Announcer: John Marsh Slartibartfast shows Ford and Arthur an Informational Illusion about the Krikkit Wars and the Wikkit Gate, and that the game of cricket on Earth is a \\"racial memory\\" of the Wars. Investigating further, they discover that the Krikkitmen, a previously peaceful people, built their first spaceship in a year, after a spaceship landed on their planet. The planet and its sun had been previously obscured in a dust cloud that left the Krikkitmen unaware of the existence or even possibility of existence of stars. It is considered remarkable that they constructed a working ship in just a year. After they saw the rest of the universe existed, they decided to annihilate it. Meanwhile, on the Heart of Gold, Zaphod Beeblebrox hears the noise of thousands of people saying \\"Wop\\". He intercepts them on the bridge, where he is told they want the \\"Golden Bail\\", the ship's Infinite Improbability Drive. They take it, shoot him, and leave. Back on Slartibartfast's ship, Ford and Arthur watch the Krikkit War Crimes Trial, presided over by Judiciary Pag. Pag's sentence is that Krikkit will be locked in an envelope of \\"Slo-Time\\", until the universe has ended, when it will be released, thus saving the universe from attack from Krikkit, and allowing Krikkit to exist in isolation after the end of the universe. However, a Krikkit ship escaped. Slartibartfast notes that parts of the key to the Wikkit Gate, sealing the envelope of Slo-Time, have been re- appearing. After a failed attempt to recover the Wooden Pillar (the Ashes), Slartibartfast plans to go to a party, to locate the Silver Bail. Ford disagrees with this objective but agrees with the concept of going to a party. They teleport from the ship. Arthur does not materialise with Ford and Slartibartfast, but elsewhere, in a gloomy room, with signs such as \\"DO NOT BE ALARMED. BE VERY VERY FRIGHTENED, ARTHUR DENT\\". The episode ends on a cliff- hanger, with the previously unintroduced character of Agrajag saying \\"Bet you weren't expecting to see me again.\\" The episode includes several Guide interludes, notably the story of Lallafa the poet, and a description of Brockian Ultra-Cricket. =Fit the Sixteenth= *Broadcast on BBC Radio 4, 12 October 2004 :Cast: :* The Book: William Franklyn :* Arthur Dent: Simon Jones :* Ford Prefect: Geoffrey McGivern :* Slartibartfast: Richard Griffiths :* Trillian: Susan Sheridan :* Thor: Dominic Hawksley :* Agrajag: Douglas Adams :* Award winner: Bob Golding :* Woman with the Sydney Opera House Head: Joanna Lumley :* Party Doorman: Paul Wickens :* Announcer: John Marsh The episode begins with Arthur, who has been \\"diverted\\" by Agrajag, who claims that Arthur has killed previous incarnations of him hundreds of times. He also claims to have been the bowl of petunias that materialised into existence in Fit the Third. Eventually it transpires one of the deaths was at Stavromula Beta, where someone tried to assassinate Arthur, and he ducked, hitting Agrajag. Arthur however has never been there. Agrajag cries \\"I've brought you here too zarking soon\\", but decides to attempt to kill Arthur anyway. Arthur and Agrajag struggle, and Agrajag dies. Arthur escapes from the Cathedral of Hate, to which he had been diverted, by running into a passageway in the mountain. He notes that he has somehow ended up with the wrong bag‚Äîone he lost on Earth many years ago. He trips, and falls, only to discover that he is flying. He experiments with flying for a while, only to be hit in the small of the back by the party which Ford and Slartibartfast are attempting to enter. The party is flying as well, and Ford and Slartibartfast are on a ledge around the building, not being permitted entry due to the lack of a bottle. Arthur remembers that his bag contains a bottle of Retsina, and this gets them entry. They see Trillian and Thor at the party, where Thor is chatting Trillian up. They quiz people trying to find the Silver Bail, and discover that it has been instantiated as an award (a Rory) for the Most Gratuitous Use Of The Word Fuck In A Serious Screenplay. Before they are actually able to find it, the Krikkit robots appear, massacre the party-goers and take the Silver Bail. Arthur tricks Thor into walking out of the building by challenging him to fight, leaving Trillian with no choice but to come with them. The Krikkitmen now have all the parts of the Wikkit Key, and Slartibartfast notes that their next move must be to go to the Wikkit Gate itself and try to intervene. =Fit the Seventeenth= *Broadcast on BBC Radio 4, 19 October 2004 :Cast: :* The Book: William Franklyn :* Arthur Dent: Simon Jones :* Ford Prefect (and Hactar, in flashbacks, uncredited): Geoffrey McGivern :* Trillian: Susan Sheridan :* Zaphod Beeblebrox: Mark Wing-Davey :* Marvin the Paranoid Android: Stephen Moore :* Krikkit Commander: Dominic Hawksley :* Slartibartfast: Richard Griffiths :* Eddie the Computer: Roger Gregg :* Dispatcher (and Silastic Armorfiends, uncredited): Bob Golding :* Krikkit Man One: Michael Fenton Stevens :* Krikkit Man Two: Philip Pope :* Announcer: John Marsh The episode opens with a Guide entry about the Silastic Armorfiends, a very aggressive species, who apparently were the first race ever to shock a computer, by asking it (Hactar) to design the \\"Ultimate Weapon\\". Hactar designed one, a small bomb which would destroy every sun in the universe by connecting them in hyperspace. However, it turned out to be a dud, because Hactar had decided that any possible consequence of making it a dud would be better than it actually being used. The Silastic Armorfiends were unimpressed with this and destroyed Hactar, and later themselves. They arrive at the asteroid, but too late to do anything but watch. The Krikkit robots place the key into the Wikkit Gate, revealing Krikkit. As the robots from the escaped Krikkit ship leave their ship, they notice that Zaphod Beeblebrox is with them, who gets knocked out by the Krikkitmen, who then proceed to actually destroy the lock. Zaphod explains that they had brought him on their ship, but had not killed him; but not for any obvious reason. Zaphod comes with the others on Slartibartfast's ship, where Slartibartfast announces that they have no choice but to go down to the surface of Krikkit. Arthur had recovered two items‚Äîthe Golden Bail, in order to allow the Heart of Gold to work once more, and more importantly, the Ashes of the Wooden Pillar. Zaphod returns to the Heart of Gold, and asks Trillian whether she wishes to come with him‚Äîshe declines. Arthur, Ford, Trillian and Slartibartfast finally land on Krikkit, where they notice that there are hundreds of floating buildings and warships above the surface. They are soon apprehended by some Krikkitmen, who ask them if they are aliens. The Krikkitmen ask them about the \\"balance of nature\\". They express concern that the plan of universal destruction would upset the balance of nature, and also would stop them from having sporting links with the rest of the Galaxy. The leader of the group, in private, explains to Trillian they have a bomb, that can destroy everything that exists, and cries about this. Aware of the cliche, Trillian asks him to \\"take me to your leader\\", who resides \\"up there\\" in the sky, far away from the Krikkitmen on the surface. Meanwhile, the others notice that the Heart of Gold is visible in the war zones above the planet. Zaphod sneaks into one of the floating buildings, where he finds the original starship that crash-landed on Krikkit. He recognises it instantly as a fake, designed to teach a non-spacefaring race how spaceships work. He later overhears a conversation between two Krikkit officers, and that apparently the robots are getting depressed and do fiendishly difficult quadratic equations instead of fighting. The episode ends with Zaphod over-hearing Marvin sing a depressing song. =Fit the Eighteenth= *Broadcast on BBC Radio 4, 26 October 2004 :Cast: :* The Book: William Franklyn :* Arthur Dent: Simon Jones :* Ford Prefect: Geoffrey McGivern :* Zaphod Beeblebrox: Mark Wing-Davey :* Trillian: Susan Sheridan :* Marvin the Paranoid Android: Stephen Moore :* Elder of Krikkit: Dominic Hawksley :* Slartibartfast: Richard Griffiths :* Eddie the Computer: Roger Gregg :* Krikkit Civilian: Bob Golding :* Wowbagger: Toby Longworth :* Henry Blofeld: Himself :* Fred Trueman: Himself :* Prak: Chris Langham :* Hactar: Leslie Phillips :* Announcer: John Marsh Ford, Arthur and Slartibartfast are on the surface of Krikkit, prisoners of the Krikkitmen, and waiting for Trillian to get back, or for Zaphod to do something. Zaphod has discovered Marvin, who since he was stolen by the Krikkit robots, has been plugged into the Krikkit mainframe and is being used as its central computer, hence depressing the robots, and making them unable to kill Zaphod. Marvin shows Zaphod CCTV of Trillian talking to the Elders of Krikkit. Trillian is explaining that Krikkit's history is a sequence of contrived coincidences that was set up in order to provoke a race into wanting to destroy the universe. She points out their ultimate weapon, the supernova bomb, would destroy Krikkit as well, and that they ought to know that if they'd built it themselves instead of taking instructions from Hactar. A robot (independent from Marvin) detonates the bomb, only for it to turn out to be a dud. Arthur, Ford, Marvin, Slartibartfast, Trillian and Zaphod all return to the Heart of Gold, just outside the dust cloud. A pocket of pseudo-gravity has opened with an oxygen atmosphere, and Arthur and Trillian exit the airlock into it. There, they meet Hactar, who explains that when the Silastic Armorfiends tried to destroy him, they failed, and because of his cellular nature, he was eventually able to coalesce sufficiently to influence things. In the long years he grew to regret his decision to make the bomb a dud. He created the dust cloud around Krikkit and also the fake wrecked spacecraft that provoked them to develop spaceflight. He knows they are going to destroy them, and they do. His final words are \\"I have fulfilled my function...\\" They have in the mean-time picked up a man named Prak, who was a witness at a trial when the Krikkit robots broke in and stole the Perspex Pillar. The robots jogged the arm of the person administering him truth drugs, and he took a huge overdose. He was then told to tell \\"the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth\\"‚Äîa horrifying fate. The court-house was abandoned, with him in place. He has apparently stopped telling it (\\"there not nearly as much of it as people imagine\\"), but is still finding much of it, particularly frogs and Arthur Dent, hilarious. They ask him if he knows the Question to the Ultimate Answer of 42. He explains that knowledge of the Question and the Answer are mutually exclusive and that if both were to be known the universe would be replaced by something more bizarre and inexplicable. However, he does have the address of God's Last Message to his Creation, which he gives to them, but before Arthur is able to take down the address, Prak dies. After this, they return to Lord's Cricket Ground, on Earth, after the Krikkit robot attack, to return the Ashes. In the destruction, Arthur is unable to find anyone to return the Ashes to. He notes that he is at Lord's, and one of his ambitions was always to bowl at Lord's. He still has the ball he caught last time he was there, he decides to bowl the ball at the batsman standing at the wicket. Mid-run, Ford points out that \\"it's not an England batsman, it's a Krikkit robot\\", and that the ball is probably a supernova bomb, and not a dud. He finds himself unable to stop running and bowls anyway. It goes wide, and Ford catches the ball, the universe being saved by Arthur's poor bowling. Arthur decapitates the robot with its own bat, and then expresses his desire for a cup of tea. Radio series four and five A fourth and fifth series based on So Long, and Thanks For All the Fish and Mostly Harmless respectively follow. The names for these series were chosen because they sound \\"less daunting, more memorable and are a bit easier to spell\\" than the standard terms quaternary and quinary. While these were treated as the fourth and fifth Hitchhiker's Guide radio series, they were broadcast in one eight-week stretch in May and June 2005. The tradition of \\"Fits\\" continues; these were known as Fit the Nineteenth through Fit the Twenty-Sixth. The manner of broadcasting these episodes carries over from the Tertiary Phase: the original broadcast was on Tuesday, with a Thursday repeat (with the exception of Fit the Nineteenth, which was not repeated due to election coverage).BBC Radio 4 episode guide page. After the initial Tuesday broadcast, audio streams of the episode were available until the following Tuesday. For these final phases, the core cast (Simon Jones, Geoffrey McGivern, Mark Wing-Davey, Susan Sheridan and Stephen Moore) returned, along with William Franklyn as the new voice of The Book (assisted by Rula Lenska). In addition, David Dixon, Sandra Dickinson, Bill Paterson, Roy Hudd and Jonathan Pryce, who had roles in the TV adaptation or the original radio series, all returned, though Dixon and Paterson both play new roles. The \\"Quandary Phase\\" was released in a 2-CD set in late May 2005. The CDs contain material not present in the original transmissions, due to time constraints. The enclosed booklet contains notes from Dirk Maggs, Simon Jones, Bruce Hyman and Helen Chattwell. A 2-CD release of the \\"Quintessential Phase\\" was released in mid-June 2005, with similar material left out of the original transmissions, and notes in the booklet by the same four individuals.

They head towards Earth independently, Arthur arriving first. After landing in a field in Somerset, Arthur tries to hike a lift to Cottington, to see if his house still exists. Along the way, he meets Rob McKenna, a man who complains about the rain, before realising he has hitched a lift the wrong way. He gets out, and gets a lift with Russell, whose sister, Fenchurch, is out cold on a back seat of the car. Arthur is instantly smitten, and asks about her. Russell claims that she is mad, and has been ever since \\"the hallucinations\\"--the Vogon Constructor Fleet. On the Constructor Fleet, a junior crew member notices that Earth has re-appeared. He is overridden by the captain, Jeltz, who declares that he saw it destroyed himself. Meanwhile, Ford is stuck in a bar with a large bill, which he avoids paying by promising to write an entry for the bar in the Guide. On the streets, he is asked by a hooker whether he is \\"rich\\", and says that he might be--being owed several years back pay for writing two words. He shows the two words--\\"Mostly Harmless\\"--to the hooker, and is shocked to see the guide updating this to his full entry. He decides to go to Earth himself. =Fit the Twentieth= *Broadcast on BBC Radio 4, 10 May 2005 :Cast: :* The Book: William Franklyn :* Arthur Dent: Simon Jones :* Ford Prefect: Geoffrey McGivern :* Rob McKenna: Bill Paterson :* Fenchurch: Jane Horrocks :* Raffle Woman: June Whitfield :* BT Operator/Barmaid/News Anchor 2: Ann Bryson :* Jim (Bartender)/News Anchor 1: Simon Greenall :* Speaking Clock: Brian Cobby :* Ecological Man/Zirzla Leader: David Dixon :* Arthur's BBC Boss: Geoffrey Perkins :* Announcer: John Marsh Arthur arrives at his house, finding it undemolished and the phone ringing. He is unable to get to the phone before it rings off. The contents of the house are as he left them, apart from a large pile of junk mail just inside the front door, and a strange bowl, bearing the inscription \\"So Long and Thanks for All the Fish\\". He phones his boss at the BBC to explain that he has been absent due to going mad and would return to work when hedgehogs come out of hibernation (plus a few minutes to have a shave). Driving, he encounters Fenchurch again, and gives her a lift to the train station, saying that he has something he wants to tell her. At the station pub they attempt to engage in conversation, but are interrupted by someone offering raffle tickets. Fenchurch has to leave to catch her train, and leaves her phone number on a ticket--with which Arthur then wins the raffle. Distraught, Arthur decides to find the Islington cave that he spent some years in during prehistoric times. He knocks on a few doors in Islington near where he thinks that cave was, firstly calling at Friends of the World. When there he attempts to make a donation to \\"save the dolphins\\" but is met with mockery from the \\"Ecological Man\\" (played by David Dixon, Ford Prefect from the television series. There is a brief allusion to the TV series as Arthur asks if they've met before). The next door he knocks on is Fenchurch's. She is surprised that he didn't call first, shows him his misplaced copy of the Guide, and notes that they need to talk. =Fit the Twenty-First= *Broadcast on BBC Radio 4, 17 May 2005 :Cast: :* The Book: William Franklyn :* Arthur Dent: Simon Jones :* Ford Prefect: Geoffrey McGivern :* Fenchurch: Jane Horrocks :* Murray Bost Henson: Stephen Fry :* East River Creature: Jackie Mason :* Vogon Councillor: Dominic Hawksley :* Steward: Simon Greenall :* Mrs Kapelsen: Margaret Robertson :* Vogon Clerk: Michael Cule :* Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz: Toby Longworth :* Wonko the Sane (John Watson): Christian Slater :* Announcer: John Marsh Fenchurch tells Arthur about her revelation at the time of the Vogon fleet's visit. At her urging, Arthur figures out that her feet do not touch the ground, leading him to suspect that she also can fly, and to a romantic tryst on the wing of a Heathrow-bound airplane. Curious about the dolphins' fate, Arthur and Fenchurch head to California to visit Wonko the Sane, a scientist considered the foremost expert on the species. Wonko, who lives in an inside-out house called \\"The Outside of the Asylum\\" and claims to have had conversations with green-winged angels, tells Arthur and Fenchurch that they all received the same glass bowls--farewell gifts from the dolphins that, when pinged, play their final message to humans. Meanwhile, a Vogon inquiry reveals that Earth's location in a plural zone means that any destroyed version is highly likely to be replaced by an alternate one. The Vogons decide that all Earths must still be destroyed, even though the bypass project has been cancelled. The music that plays when Arthur determines that Fenchurch can fly, and again during the end credits, is strongly reminiscent of the style of Dire Straits. The book, \\"So Long, and Thanks for all the Fish\\", says that Arthur and Fenchurch listened to Dire Straits on a Walkman cassette player, with two sets of headphones, while flying together (inspired by the music that Douglas Adams listened to whilst writing the book). =Fit the Twenty-Second= *The final episode in the adaptation of So Long, and Thanks For All the Fish. *Broadcast on BBC Radio 4, 24 May 2005 :Cast: :*The Book: William Franklyn :*Arthur Dent: Simon Jones :*Ford Prefect: Geoffrey McGivern :*Rob McKenna: Bill Paterson :*Fenchurch: Jane Horrocks :*Tricia McMillan: Sandra Dickinson :*Marvin the Paranoid Android: Stephen Moore :*The Lajestic Vantrasheel of Lob: Bob Golding :*Stewardess: Alison Pettitt :*Speaking Clock: Brian Cobby :*Nick Clarke: Himself :*Charlotte Green: Herself :*Peter Donaldson: Himself :*Sir Patrick Moore: Himself :*Announcer: John Marsh Fenchurch and Arthur return to England, to discover that a large spaceship has landed in Knightsbridge, London, bringing Ford Prefect with it. Fenchurch, Arthur and Ford leave on the ship. Arthur begins to suspect that this is not the Earth he and Ford knew--there is a \\"Tricia McMillan\\" on the news, with an American accent and blonde hair (voiced by Sandra Dickinson, who played Trillian in the TV series), but otherwise identical to the Trillian who left his earth with Zaphod Beeblebrox. Fenchurch and Arthur go to see God's Final Message to His Creation, and bump into Marvin, who is also en route to see it. Marvin is now 37 times older than the universe itself, and needs assistance to read the message, which turns out to be \\"WE APOLOGISE FOR THE INCONVENIENCE\\". Declaring that he thinks he feels good about the message, Marvin dies. This is followed by an event only mentioned in Mostly Harmless. Fenchurch asks Arthur to show her the universe. However, on a commercial liner flight, Fenchurch disappears, and the ship's crew deny she ever existed... At the conclusion of the show's credits, a tie-in website is announced: McKenna's All-Weather Haulage. The Quintessential Phase Front cover of the BBC Audio release of the \\"Quintessential Phase\\" (Fits 23-26) of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The Quintessential Phase has one sub-plot of Zaphod attempting to reach Zarniwoop (which did occur in Fit the Twelfth, but that version was dismissed during the Tertiary Phase as Zaphod having a \\"psychotic episode\\"‚Äîanother version of events occurs here, in an attempt to interconnect all five series). Zarniwoop has been merged with the character Vann Harl from Mostly Harmless. This radio series also sees the return of the characters of Max Quordlepleen, Thor, and Zarquon (who all appeared in Fit the Fifth at Milliways), and also Mr. Prosser, from Fit the First. None of these characters appear in the book version of Mostly Harmless. The start of some of the plot threads from Mostly Harmless were introduced in the Quandary Phase (though they did not appear in So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish)‚Äînotably the Vogons discovering that Earth had re-appeared and resolving to destroy all versions of it, Arthur having sold his DNA, a mention that Trillian now has a child and is now a reporter. Also the final episode saw the introduction of an alternate version of Trillian, still known as Tricia McMillan, who is identical to the original Trillian except for being blonde and American. This alternate McMillan is played by Sandra Dickinson, who played Trillian in the television series. The events at the end of this series are referenced in the latest Hitchhiker book, And Another Thing... by Eoin Colfer, where the dream sequence the Hitchhiker's Guide Mk.2 puts Trillian into involves the Babel Fish teleporting her and the other main characters away from the destroyed Earth to Milliways, similar to one of the endings. Van Harl is also mentioned as Zarniwoop Van Harl, among other nods to the radio series such as a reference to Brontitall and the bird people from the Secondary Phase that were never put into the novels. =Fit the Twenty-Third= *Broadcast on BBC Radio 4, 31 May 2005 :Cast: :*The Book: William Franklyn :*Voice of the Bird: Rula Lenska :*Arthur Dent: Simon Jones :*Ford Prefect: Geoffrey McGivern :*Zaphod Beeblebrox: Mark Wing-Davey :*Trillian: Susan Sheridan :*Tricia McMillan: Sandra Dickinson :*Zarniwoop Vann Harl: Jonathan Pryce :*Eddie the Computer: Roger Gregg :*Grebulons: Andy Taylor and Michael Fenton Stevens :*Prophet: John Challis :*Information Creature: Mitch Benn :*Gail Andrews: Lorelei King :*Colin the Robot: Andrew Secombe :*Announcer: John Marsh The episode opens with a Grebulon spaceship suffering an accident, and losing nearly all records of what it is and what it should be doing, along with the crew's memories of why. Based on what little remains of their orders, they land on the tenth planet from the Sun, and start to 'monitor' Earth. After a year's travelling Arthur has returned to the co-ordinates ZZ9 plural Z alpha‚Äîwhere he is expecting to find Earth, and perhaps Fenchurch. In its place, he finds a barely colonised planet called NowWhat, although with the right continents for Earth. The creature at the information desk explains that beings from a \\"plural\\" region are not advised to travel in hyperspace due to the risk of slipping in dimensions. He is directed to Hawalius, a planet of oracles. During a flashback, the introduction between Trillian and Zaphod Beeblebrox is revealed. But on a parallel Earth, an American and blonde Tricia McMillan (who was left behind by her universe's Zaphod) is interviewing Gail Andrews, an astrologer, about the effect that the recently discovered planet Persephone (nicknamed Rupert) will have on astrology. The Grebulons, monitoring this, have an idea. Later, Andrews and McMillan talk. Andrews has sensed that McMillan is unhappy about the stars‚ÄîMcMillan reveals that she met an alien (Zaphod Beeblebrox) at a party once (a variation of the previous flashback ensues), but didn't get to go with him because she fetched her bag. She also reveals that she just missed out on a TV job in New York City because she did not go back to fetch her bag. Meanwhile, Zaphod (who does not appear in the book) is attempting to meet Zarniwoop once more, convinced that the Total Perspective Vortex (from Fit the Eighth) was not just his imagination. He has arrived at Saquo-Pilia Hensha, the new location of the offices for The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. He sneaks into the building pretending to deliver pizza, and goes to the editor's office. He meets Zarniwoop Vann Harl, who promises to explain matters. The story turns back to Arthur, who has arrived at Hawalius. He is told by an oracle that prophecy is a dead business now, due to news reports from the future using time travel. He is given a piece of free advice‚Äî\\"it'll all end in tears, probably already has\\", and sent on his way to the next cave. Back at the Hitchhiker's building, Ford is also sneaking in. He climbs into the building through the ventilation system, disables a security robot (which he dubs \\"Colin\\") by hardwiring it to be happy all the time, and then gets it to cover his entrance to the editor's office, finding out along the way that the Guide has been taken over and is no longer owned by Megadodo Publications. He too manages to get into the editor's office and finds that Vann Harl has been expecting Ford. The episode ends here on a cliff-hanger. =Fit the Twenty-Fourth= *Broadcast on BBC Radio 4, 7 June 2005 :Cast: :*The Book: William Franklyn :*Voice of the Bird: Rula Lenska :*Arthur Dent: Simon Jones :*Ford Prefect: Geoffrey McGivern :*Zaphod Beeblebrox: Mark Wing-Davey :*Zarniwoop Vann Harl: Jonathan Pryce :*Old Man on the Pole: Saeed Jaffrey :*Smelly Photocopier Woman: Miriam Margolyes :*Tricia McMillan: Sandra Dickinson :*Stewardess: Lorelei King :*Colin the Robot: Andrew Secombe :*Accountancy Bird and Lift: Roger Gregg :*Grebulon Underling: Philip Pope :*Grebulon Lieutenant and Accountancy Bird: Michael Fenton Stevens :*Accountancy Bird: Danny Flint :*Announcer: John Marsh Arthur is still trying to gain advice on the planet Hawalius, but when he finally leaves the planet, the spaceship he's on develops \\"a major glitch\\" just as they jump into hyperspace. Meanwhile, on Earth, Tricia McMillan agrees to go with the Grebulons and work out a system of astrology that would be valid on the planet Persephone (Rupert), in exchange for exclusive rights to the story. Back in The Guide's offices, Zarniwoop Vann Harl, the new editor of the guide, asks Ford to be his restaurant critic. He explains that there is a new Guide, aimed at families rather than hitchhikers, and they plan to make one and sell it in billions of billions of alternate worlds. Ford steals the Dine-a-Charge and Ident-i-Eze cards from him, then hacks into the accountancy system. The universe there is equated with the artificial universe inside Zarniwoop's office, and Ford discovers Zaphod, in a shack by the beach, claiming he has been there on his own for a month. Zaphod claims that the Presidency and the Krikkitmen were just a distraction, and that they have \\"shrunk the Vortex and given it the voice of that Lintilla chick\\" in order to create the new Guide. The episode ends with Ford going to floor 23, and being forced to jump out of a window, in order to escape from Zarniwoop Vann Harl, who is revealed to be a disguised Vogon. =Fit the Twenty-Fifth= *Broadcast on BBC Radio 4, 14 June 2005 :Cast: :*The Book: William Franklyn :*Voice of the Bird: Rula Lenska :*Arthur Dent: Simon Jones :*Ford Prefect: Geoffrey McGivern :*Trillian: Susan Sheridan :*Tricia McMillan: Sandra Dickinson :*Random Dent: Sam B√©art :*Old Thrashbarg: Griff Rhys Jones :*Strinder and Doctor: Roger Gregg :*Grebulon Leader: Andy Taylor :*The Patient: Lorelei King :*Grebulon Lieutenant: Michael Fenton Stevens :*Colin the Robot: Andrew Secombe :*Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz: Toby Longworth :*Speaking Clock: Brian Cobby :*Announcer: John Marsh Arthur Dent has, since the last episode, settled on the planet his ship crash-landed on, Lamuella, which is partly in a \\"plural zone\\". He is occupied as The Sandwich Maker, making sandwiches for the inhabitants of a village from the meat of the Perfectly Normal Beast. Perfectly Normal Beasts are rather like bison, and migrate. A messenger brings news to the Sandwich Maker that a spaceship has landed on the planet. When Arthur approaches it, he is surprised to see Trillian disembark. Trillian explains that the crash was known about, but nobody has been to rescue him for insurance reasons. She explains that she had a daughter, named Random, using sperm sold by Arthur, and has come to drop off her daughter (of indeterminate age due to time travel, but probably around 16), whilst she is off covering a war. At the Hitchhiker's Guide building, Ford saves himself by using Colin's antigravity systems to get to a ledge on the 13th floor of the building. He bypasses the rocket-proof glass by unlatching the window. Colin notes that the rocket-proof glass was installed after the Frogstar attack on the building (in Fit the Seventh), which Ford knows nothing about. Meanwhile, on Lamuella, Random is not settling in well. Born on a spaceship going from one place to another place, she doesn't consider anywhere home, and Earth, the world both her parents are from, has been destroyed. A robot courier arrives with a package, for Ford Prefect care of Arthur Dent, which Arthur decides to keep safely closed on the basis that anything that involves Ford Prefect is dangerous. Distraught at her lack of place in the universe, Random runs off with the package into the forest, which is considered haunted by the natives of Lamuella. Random discovers that the holo-entertainment system from the rocket ship that Arthur Dent crash landed in, which is still functional, as the source of the \\"hauntings\\". She opens the package, revealing the Guide Mark II, in the form of a black bird. The Bird explains the nature of probability and that some alternative Earths do exist, and persuades Random to go to one of them. Random challenges the Bird to get her a spaceship there, and just at that moment, one lands. She downs the pilot with a well-thrown rock, and leaves Lamuella. The alternate Tricia McMillan has been taken to Rupert and meets the Grebulon leader, who explains their problem of having forgotten everything, and their reasoning in trying to gain purpose through astrology. Meanwhile, Arthur has been looking for Random and has seen the spaceship. Searching the forest he stumbles onto the pilot of the ship, Ford Prefect. =Fit the Twenty-Sixth= *The final episode in the adaptation of Mostly Harmless *Broadcast on BBC Radio 4, 21 June 2005 :Cast: :*The Book: Peter Jones and William Franklyn :*Voice of the Bird (and Lintilla, uncredited): Rula Lenska :*Arthur Dent: Simon Jones :*Ford Prefect: Geoffrey McGivern :*Zaphod Beeblebrox: Mark Wing-Davey :*Trillian: Susan Sheridan :*Tricia McMillan: Sandra Dickinson :*Random: Sam B√®art :*Marvin the Paranoid Android: Stephen Moore :*Fenchurch: Jane Horrocks (uncredited) :*Old Thrashbarg: Griff Rhys Jones :*Bartender: Roger Gregg :*Vogon Helmsman: Michael Cule :*Thor: Dominic Hawksley :*Grebulon Leader: Andy Taylor :*Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz and Wowbagger: Toby Longworth :*Grebulon Lieutenant: Mike Fenton Stevens :*Elvis: Philip Pope :*The Newsreader: Neil Sleat :*Max Quordlepleen: Roy Hudd :*Runner: Tom Maggs :*Agrajag: Douglas Adams :*Announcer: John Marsh The episode opens with Ford and Arthur on Lamuella. Ford explains about the new guide and its ability to use Reverse Temporal Engineering in order to arrange circumstances for the benefit of its user. Ford's spaceship itself he obtained by jumping from a building and falling into it, its previous occupant having accidentally pressed the wrong sort of eject button. Tracing back, he discovered that a trail of coincidences led back to the new Guide, which was responsible. With Random stealing the ship and the Bird, they are stuck, with no immediate way to get offworld to prevent the Vogons from doing whatever it is they intend to do. They decide that the Perfectly Normal Beasts are the best way off the planet. The migration has already started, and this sees them appear at one point, run past Lamuella, and then disappear again, evidence of a dimensional shift. Old Thrashbarg helps them slow a Perfectly Normal Beast long enough for them to get onto it, and tells them that they will be entering the Domain of the King. On the alternate Earth, Tricia McMillan has returned from Rupert, and is lamenting that none of the footage she has taken is usable. She is interrupted by a member of the hotel staff, telling her that a spaceship has landed in Regent's Park, and the young girl on the ship is demanding to see her. Meanwhile, the Grebulon leader is still unhappy. Whilst they now have horoscopes, he now knows that unless he takes positive action, then due to the Earth rising, he will have a very bad month. He decides to investigate the possible astrological uses of the Grebulon's gun turrets. Arthur and Ford arrive at the Domain of the King Bar and Grill, which has numerous spaceships outside of it, including a large pink one. Inside, they have a couple of bacon rolls, whilst Ford buys the pink spaceship from the bar singer, Elvis Presley. They then depart for Earth. After arriving, they find that Tricia McMillan has taken Random to a club, and go there themselves. A strange man confronts Arthur, and says \\"I told you not to come here!\\" Arthur and Ford find Random, along with Tricia and Trillian (who had arrived in the meantime on a third spaceship). Random is holding a gun and threatening to shoot. Trillian explains they must leave the planet immediately, as the Grebulons (a missing spaceship from the war she was sent to cover) are about to destroy the planet, once again. Arthur explains it is impossible for him to die (and hence for the planet to be destroyed), but the strange man goes for Random's gun and she ends up shooting him. Trillian points out the name of the club to Arthur‚ÄîStavro M√ºller Beta‚Äîwhile Arthur realizes the strange man is Agrajag. Arthur accepts his fate, and the Earth is destroyed...  Epilogue  An updated edition of the Guide notes that Babel fish share the ability of the dolphins in shifting sideways in probability when required, bringing their host and sometimes other people in the vicinity with them, and notes that this in fact has happened. The Guide shares the fate of Arthur in two alternate realities: the first, continuing from the end of Fit the Twelfth, sees Arthur and Lintilla and several of her clones aboard the Heart of Gold; the second sees Arthur from the beginning of the story, this time battling Prosser over the fate of his home, with Fenchurch now lying with him in front of the bulldozer. The Guide then details the true reality of what happened: the Babel Fish brought Arthur, Ford, Random, Zaphod and Trillian (now merged with Tricia) to Milliways, the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, Table 42. Zaphod discovers Marvin was still under warranty and has been restored to physical health, and is once again washing cars at Milliways, albeit with a promotion, and Arthur discovers the waitress serving their table is Fenchurch, who has been at Milliways waiting for him to turn up. As Wowbagger the Infinitely Prolonged arrives to insult the Great Prophet Zarquon, making his perennial appearance on the Milliways stage, Wowbagger's immortality is rescinded, and he dies. Elsewhere in the universe, Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz, having finally destroyed the Earth after all this time, is able to tick the box on his orders and move on. Reunited, Arthur promises to take Fenchurch flying.

Grant. Loosely based on his childhood in Swaziland (now Eswatini), as depicted in Grant's memoir, \\"The Wah-Wah Diaries\\", it stars Nicholas Hoult, Gabriel Byrne, Emily Watson, Miranda Richardson and Julie Walters. Filmed and set in Swaziland, the film was first shown at the Cannes Film Market on 13 May 2005 and premiered at the Edinburgh International Film Festival on 17 August 2005. It then toured to various festivals before receiving a limited release in the United States on 5 May 2006, followed by its release in the United Kingdom on 2 June 2006.IMDb: Release info for Wah-Wah Linked 27 June 2013 Plot In this semi- autobiographical tale of his childhood in Swaziland during the last days of the British Empire in Africa in the 1960s, Grant relates the story of Ralph Compton, whose family‚Äôs disintegration mirrors the end of British rule. After witnessing his mother's adultery with his father's best friend, Ralph must survive not only boarding school but also his beloved father's remarriage to Ruby, a fast-talking American Airlines flight attendant, and his father's gradual descent into alcoholism. History =Development and pre- production= Grant initially wrote the film loosely based on his own childhood experiences after a screenwriter recommended he write a screenplay after reading his memoirs of his Withnail and I experiences. The first meeting with a producer took place in 1999 and the film took almost seven years from then to complete.Wah-Wah Interview - \\"I've had seven birthdays...\\" Grant initially had trouble securing actors; Rachel Weisz, Toni Collette, Meg Ryan, Emmanuelle B√©art, Ralph Fiennes and Jeremy Irons all turned down roles. Julie Walters was eventually the first actor to be signed. Grant intended for the part of Ralph to be played by two actors but the casting director, Celestia Fox, insisted on one actor. During the casting sessions, Grant noticed the similarity between Zac Fox and Nicholas Hoult and persuaded Celestia Fox to cast them. The part of the father was meant to be younger but, as all the actors asked in that age range passed on the role, an older actor (Gabriel Byrne) was chosen. After the original producer left the project due to a career change, Grant was approached by Marie-Castille Mention-Schaar to produce the project, a decision he later came to regret. = Production and aftermath = The film was the first to have been shot in Swaziland. Filming began in July 2004 and took place over seven weeks and post-production took place in England and France. Wah-Wah received its premiere at the Edinburgh International Film Festival and received a special Toronto International Film Festival screening in September 2005.Wah-Wah - IMDb Trivia Grant also kept a diary of his experiences of the film, later published as a book, (The Wah-Wah Diaries), which was met positively by the critics, many of whom were impressed at the honesty of the tale, especially in regard to his frictional relationship with the \\"inexperienced\\" producer.Amazon.co.uk - The Wah-Wah DiariesThe Guardian - Books - Wah-Wah Diaries reviewThe Independent - Books - Wah-Wah Diaries review Grant mentioned in subsequent interviews that she was a \\"control freak out of control\\" and that he would \\"never see her again as long as [he] lives\\".Richard E Grant - Wah-Wah interviewThe Sun Herald Interview - Wah-Wah In a BBC interview, he again mentioned his \\"disastrous\\" relationship with Mention-Schaar, relating that he received five emails in the last two months of pre-production from her, that she rarely turned up on the set and failed to obtain clearance both for the song rights and to actually film in Swaziland (without the knowledge of Grant, who eventually was forced to meet the King of Swaziland to seek clemency). =Main cast= Critical reception Critics were split on Wah-Wah. BBC Movies said it was \\"superbly performed and fluently shot\\", but lamented its uninteresting subject.BBC Wah- Wah review David Hughes of Empire magazine said that the film was \\"an unforced, engaging and surprisingly incisive account of the disintegration of British rule in Africa\\".Wah-Wah at Rotten Tomatoes Time Out noted that \\"Gabriel Byrne gives a great performance as Ralph‚Äôs troubled father, Harry, and Miranda Richardson and Emily Watson are enjoyable as Harry‚Äôs wife and American lover\\". Variety said that \\"above all, the film has a wonderful sense of ensemble in the portrayal of its inbred community, and the focus stays tight on the people rather than political events\\" and The Los Angeles Times said that \\"Grant opens up his life, not with embarrassment or explanation but with humanity and gratitude. Emotional, melodramatic and sentimental, the film unabashedly wears its heart on its sleeve, and is the better for it.\\" Roger Ebert was less praising, noting that he \\"admired the movie and was happy to see it but can think of two other films about whites in Africa that do a better job of seeing their roles (Nowhere in Africa and White Mischief).\\"Wah- Wah :: rogerebert.com :: Reviews , the film holds a 54% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 69 reviews with an average rating of 5.91/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \\"The ensemble cast is strong, but they get overpowered by the muddled stew of melodrama.\\" =Box office= The film received a limited release and only grossed $2.8 million worldwide on a $7 million budget.

Leigh was forced out of the military government in 1978. Biography Leigh was born in Santiago, son of Army Colonel Hern√°n Leigh Ba√±ados and Laura Guzm√°n Cea. After a brilliant career as a combat pilot, President Salvador Allende named him commander-in-chief of the Air Force on August 17, 1973, disregarding the established basis of seniority. However, Leigh was the first to sign the coup document, drafted by Vice Admiral Jos√© Toribio Merino, to depose Allende. Leigh quickly emerged as the toughest member in the four-man military junta. Just hours after the coup, Leigh vowed that the military would \\"eradicate the Marxist cancer from our fatherland, until the last consequences.\\" It was on his personal orders, he disclosed later, that the Air Force bombarded and heavily damaged the presidential palace to put down the resistance by Allende and a small group of his followers. He responded to criticisms that his order to bomb the La Moneda palace saying, \\"It was a hard measure to take, but believe me when I say that [...] it was a measure that saved many lives, because President Allende had decided to die in La Moneda [...].\\" A fierce persecution of leftists followed, and Leigh's Air Force gained a reputation as especially implacable with dissidents. Leigh defended the coup, arguing that a civil war between Chileans was inevitable. When American President Jimmy Carter criticized the military rule in Chile in 1977, Leigh said, \\"He [Carter] is a hypocrite. He condemns Chile, but at the same time he wants closer relations with a dictatorship like Castro's in Cuba, that had led an authoritarian regime for 18 years.\\" He purged the Air Force of left-wing officers such as General Alberto Bachelet (the father of Michelle Bachelet, future Chilean president) and repeatedly called on Chileans to denounce left- wingers to the new authorities. Nonetheless he clashed with Augusto Pinochet, the leader of the junta over the latter's refusal to name a date for a return to democracy. Leigh opposed Pinochet's growing power within the junta. In 1978, when Pinochet called a vote to request that Chileans reject the United Nation's condemnation of the regime's human rights record, Leigh called the move \\"typical of governments in which power is in the hands of a single dictator.\\" Pinochet believed Leigh wanted to challenge him to lead the country. \\"Pinochet always felt that I was interested in taking over from him, something that never even entered my mind,\\" Leigh said in one of his last television interviews. Exit from the Junta and latter years General Leigh was a supporter of strong state intervention in the economy. He was heavily influenced by the Egyptian model being built by Anwar Sadat (he was a close friend of Hosni Mubarak, the Egyptian Air Force Chief, since 1971) of a mixed economy based on free market principles but a strong state presence in heavy industry and a strong state regulation over imports and the financial speculation market. He had continuous disagreements with the prevailing free market economic policy of the so-called Chicago Boys that was favoured by the US as well as Pinochet himself. He was strongly opposed to any divestment or privatisation in the State owned mining company Codelco. That led to his dismissal on July 24, 1978, in a decree signed by other junta members. The junta selected General Fernando Matthei to replace him. Despite his strong differences with General Pinochet, he strongly opposed Pinochet's 1998 arrest as a violation of Chilean sovereignty. Leigh was detained by a judge investigating his role in the disappearance of twelve communist leaders, but the Supreme Court of Chile ordered his release by virtue of the Law of Amnesty. Assassination attempt and death On March 21, 1990 members of the leftist guerrilla group, the Manuel Rodr√≠guez Patriotic Front, broke into Leigh's office and opened fire at him. Five bullets hit his body. Other than the loss of an eye, he was able to make a complete recovery. Leigh died of cardiovascular ailments in Santiago's Air Force Hospital on September 29, 1999, aged 79.  Literature  Marras S. (1988) Confesiones. Las ediciones del Ornitorrinco, Santiago. Varas F.

He was inducted into the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame in 2015 and the WWE Hall of Fame in 2016. Early life Hey was raised in Newton, Surrey and went to Princess Margaret High School, in BC Canada graduating in 1965. After school, he worked in local lumber mills as well as being a bouncer at nightclubs including the Grooveyard in New Westminster. He became an American citizen in 1974.Greg Oliver, \\"Buddy Roberts recalls the wild times as a Freebird and a Hollywood Blond\\", SLAM! Wrestling, July 5, 2010. Professional wrestling career =Early career (1965‚Äì1970)= Hey was trained as a professional wrestler by Ivan Koloff. He debuted in 1965 under the ring name \\"Dale Valentine\\", billed as being the younger brother of Johnny Valentine. At the tail end of the 1960s, he was working as a preliminary wrestler in the American Wrestling Association (AWA). =The Hollywood Blonds (1970‚Äì1977)= In 1970, Hey was brought into the Oklahoma-based NWA Tri-State promotion by booker Bill Watts. Watts had intended to create a new tag team comprising Jack Donovan and veteran journeyman Jerry Brown. After Donovan left the promotion following a dispute with Watts, Watts hired Hey in his place. Hey was renamed \\"Buddy Roberts\\" and began teaming with Brown as The Hollywood Blonds. In 1972, Oliver Humperdink began managing The Hollywood Blonds. The team of Brown and Roberts won numerous regional tag team titles across the United States throughout the 1970s.Hollywood Blondes title listing, from WrestlingData.com =The Fabulous Freebirds (1979‚Äì1988) = After splitting from Brown, Roberts joined with Michael Hayes and Terry Gordy to form The Fabulous Freebirds. Again, Bill Watts played a major role in this decision. Hayes and Gordy had been teaming together in various promotions in the Mid- South and Southeastern regions of the United States for several years, but Watts was not as impressed with Hayes's in-ring work as he was with his skills on the microphone. His original plan was to have Gordy and Roberts as the actual tag team, with Hayes as their manager. Except for a high-profile stint in 1980 in Mid-South Wrestling (formed by Watts the previous year after breaking away from NWA Tri-State) with Hayes and Gordy as the Freebirds, Roberts did not work full-time with the team until they joined World Class Championship Wrestling (see below). He later became known as Buddy \\"Jack\\" Roberts, due to his penchant for drinking Jack Daniel's whiskey. World Class Championship Wrestling/World Wrestling Federation/American Wrestling Association (1982-1985) The Fabulous Freebirds won several titles and moved on to World Class Championship Wrestling in late 1982 and began a high- profile feud with the Von Erich family. They wrestled David Von Erich, Kerry Von Erich, Mike Von Erich and Kevin Von Erich numerous times in 1986.Buddy Roberts' 1986 WCCW matches, from WrestlingData.com Roberts also had a long- standing feud with Von Erich ally Chris Adams, which lasted on and off for more than five years.Roberts matches with Chris Adams, from WrestlingData.com Roberts' most famous singles angle came in WCCW in 1983, and involved the invention of what the Freebirds referred to as \\"Freebird Hair Removal Cream\\". The angle culminated in a hair match between Roberts and Iceman Parsons on June 17.WCCW Wrestling Star Wars results, from WrestlingData.com Roberts seemingly won the match via tight-pulling, but the decision was reversed and the match restarted. In the fracas, Roberts' head was lathered in the hair removal cream. At subsequent events, Roberts wore a wig, kept in place by boxing headgear. In 1984, Roberts and the Freebirds had a short stint in the World Wrestling Federation, mainly competing in six-man tag matches.Roberts' 1984 WWF matches, from WrestlingData.com Here, they were managed by Cyndi Lauper's manager, David Wolff. They left the promotion when WWF officials stated their intention to split the team up. At the AWA's SuperClash in 1985, Roberts helped Hayes and Gordy defeat The Road Warriors for the AWA World Tag Team Championship, but the decision was later reversed. Universal Wrestling Federation (1986) In early 1986, The Freebirds went to the Universal Wrestling Federation, where Roberts won the UWF Television Championship on September 28. He lost it to Savannah Jack on November 9.UWF Television Title history, from WrestlingData.com Return to World Class Championship Wrestling (1987-1988) In 1987, The Freebirds split up and reformed. Roberts and Gordy turned on Hayes and teamed with Iceman Parsons to feud with Hayes and the Von Erichs. Gordy eventually left Roberts to rejoin Hayes. The feud ended in late 1988 when Hayes and Gordy left for the NWA's Jim Crockett Promotions, and Roberts acted as a manager to the Samoan Swat Team before he retired from wrestling. Roberts also had a short feud with World Class referee David Manning, which included several gimmick matches, such as Roberts wrestling with one arm tied behind his back. Manning, who was touted as an accomplished amateur wrestler by the promotion to compensate for the obvious size difference between the two, won most of the matches on a fluke. =Late career (1990-1993)= Roberts managed Hayes and Jimmy Garvin in one match against Steve Armstrong and Tracy Smothers in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) on September 5, 1990. He came out of retirement on April 2, 1993 for the Global Wrestling Federation's Kerry Von Erich Memorial Show, and teamed with Michael Hayes (with Skandor Akbar in their corner), losing to Kevin Von Erich and Chris Adams (with Fritz Von Erich in their corner). Roberts later developed throat cancer, and had surgery to treat it. He was quoted as saying \\"Don't smoke. I think the reason this happened to me is because I was smoking too much.

The land in the valley is a relative plain, despite being surrounded by several mountains and volcanos, the latter part of the Central Range. The region houses almost three quarters of Costa Ricans, and includes the capital and most populous city, San Jos√©. The valley is shared among the provinces of Alajuela, Heredia, San Jos√© and Cartago. The region occupies an area of 11,366 km¬≤, more than a fifth of the country, and is drained by the T√°rcoles River on the west side and by the Reventaz√≥n River on the east side. Geographic dimensions The Central Valley is commonly considered to extend from the city of San Ram√≥n in Alajuela in the west, to the city of Para√≠so in Cartago in the east. The mountains north of the valley are part of the Central Range. There are four main volcanoes north of the valley, namely Po√°s, Barva, Iraz√∫ and Turrialba. The mountains that round the plateau to the south form part of the Talamanca Range. A smaller range, the Carpintera Hills, which runs from north to south roughly along the border between the provinces of San Jos√© and Cartago, divides the valley into two sections. The western section is normally referred to as \\"Western Valley\\" or \\"Central Valley\\" proper and the eastern section is referred to as the Eastern Valley or \\"Valle del Guarco\\". This smaller range also impacts the weather and ecosystems of the two subregions, with the Western Valley significantly influenced by the weather patterns of Costa Rica's Pacific coast and the Eastern Valley influenced by the Caribbean coast weather. Climate Because of its altitude, the temperature in the Central Valley varies between 15¬∞C and 30¬∞C, mainly because of the position toward the mountains (the altitude also varies between 800 m and 1,500 m above sea level). The western part of the valley is influenced by trade winds in summer, and, as the rest of the country with the exception of the Caribbean region, there are two climate seasons clearly defined, wet and dry. The eastern part of the valley is influenced more by Caribbean conditions, which are more volatile. Precipitation in the region varies from 1,900 mm in an urban and central place like Pavas to 3,200 mm in a rural and mountainous place like Fraijanes. Humidity varies from 75% (10% of volatility) in Pavas, to 87% (rarely descending to less than 80%) in Fraijanes. Economic importance The Central Valley had been traditionally the favorite place for Costa Ricans to live, and even today it contains an unequal distribution of population of the country, in relation to its size. This is because of the fertility of land in the region, helped by the influence of volcanoes and rivers that run through the valley. Weather also favours agriculture and farming activities. Because of the agglomeration of population, the valley is the center of commerce, industry and service activities, sustained by ports on both coasts, and by Liberia in Guanacaste (which has the other international airport besides Juan Santamar√≠a Airport in Alajuela) that have similar economic movement. Costa Rica's Greater Metropolitan Area (GAM) covers an extension roughly the same as the Central Valley.

He was part of the Junta from 1977 to 1990, and served as minister of health from 1976 to 1978, retiring from the Air Force in July 1991. Military career The son of Fernando Matthei Aubel Gunkel and Luisa Gunkel Renz, Matthei entered the Aviation School in 1945 and the following year he was assigned to the Condors Air Base, where he obtained his appointment as a fighter pilot. In 1948, he was commissioned as a sublieutenant and was assigned to the No. 4 Bomber Group in Colina, serving concurrently as a flight instructor at the School of Aviation and Officers. He was promoted to lieutenant in 1951. That same year he married Elda Fornet, with whom he had five children: Fernando, Evelyn, Robert, Hedy Jaqueline and Victor Alejandro. In 1953 he traveled to the United States to study flight instruction at Craig Air Force Base in Alabama. He was promoted to flight captain in 1954, teaching classes in arms at the Aviation School. In 1957, he was assigned to Wing 1 in the Antofagasta Cerro Moreno Base. Posted to Santiago in 1960, he was promoted to squadron commander and sent to the School of Aviation. He became the adjutant to the air force commander in chief, General Eduardo Iensen, the following year. In 1966 he was promoted to group commander and served as commander of Aviation Group N¬∫7 between 1968-1969, when he was sent to visit facilities of the Royal Air Force (RAF). On his return home, he was appointed professor at the Air War Academy. From October 1969 he was a professor of the Pilots Course for Tactical Hawker Hunter Aircraft in Aviation Group No. 7. In November 1971, he served as air attach√© in the Chilean embassies in Britain and Sweden, based in London. On 12 October 1973, he was appointed Chief of the Air Mission of Chile in London. After the military coup in December 1973, he returned to Chile as director of the Air Force Academy. In January 1975, Matthei was promoted to air brigade general. On 19 March 1976 he was appointed Minister of Health. The 24 July 1978, after the dismissal of General Gustavo Leigh and of most generals of the institution, Matthei was promoted to air general and appointed commander of the air force and a member of the military junta, occupying the Second Legislative Committee chair. Political career Before becoming a junta member, Matthei was Minister of Health of the military government. In October 1988, Matthei was the first Junta member to publicly admit that the regime had lost the referendum to elect Pinochet for a new eight-year presidential term. Later the same day, the government stated that the referendum result would be respected and that the 1980 Constitution path to democracy would be strictly followed. In 1990, with the return of democracy, Matthei ceased to be a member of the military junta, but retained his position as the commander in chief of the Air Force. He retired voluntarily on 31 July 1991 (although, as Pinochet, he could have continued to serve until 1998) and noted that with his retirement, the air force could fully adapt to democracy. 2003 saw the publishing of the book Matthei. Mi testimonio, written by Chilean historians Patricia Arancibia and Isabel de la Maza, in which Matthei recounts his public life.http://www.patriciaarancibiaclavel.cl/libro16.html In September 2005, Matthei admitted in a television program that he \\"did everything possible so that Argentina would lose\\" the 1982 Falklands War with Britain. The extent of Chilean assistance to the UK is documented in a book, My Secret Falklands War, by retired Royal Air Force Wing Commander Sidney Edwards, who was sent to Chile by the British government to act as a liaison between the Chilean and British governments during the conflict. Matthei was born among a community of German Chileans in Southern Chile. Matthei was the father of Chilean senator and 2013 presidential candidate and current mayor of Providencia Evelyn Matthei.

It is currently driven by Mark List, Elvis Lainez, Armando Castro, Marc Mcdonald, and Scott Buetow. Other drivers of have included Dan Rodoni, Aaron Basl, Ryan Huffaker, Joey Parnell, Chris Baker, and Nathan Weenk. It features one of the first 3-D body shells, with horns sticking out of the roof. This body was originally designed for Bulldozer, and was found a second use for El Toro Loco. As El Toro Loco has increased in popularity, it has become the primary truck for the body style. The truck is commonly known for \\"snorting\\" smoke out of its nose, which is toggled by a button inside the truck. Truck History The truck was created by SFX and PACE Motorsports in 2001, and the truck was driven by Lupe Soza, who had previously owned and driven Warrior from the 80s. The truck was a huge success among kids primarily. The idea stuck around. In 2003, the truck made its first Monster Jam World Finals appearance with Lupe Soza still behind-the-wheel. With a poor performance in racing, \\"The Crazy Bull\\" made up for it in freestyle. Lupe Soza had the performance of a lifetime, featuring a crazy corkscrew flip off of an RV, and then getting the truck stuck on top of a sea container, earning him a second-place performance with a sensational score of 36 out of a possible 40. In 2004, El Toro Loco was a Monster Jam World Finals freestyle co-champion with Madusa driven by Debrah Miceli, and Maximum Destruction driven by Tom Meents, all tied with a score of 31. In 2013, El Toro Loco was given a makeover, creating a new black bodied truck piloted by Marc McDonald and a yellow bodied truck under the rein of Becky McDonough. The classic red bodies are still ran by Chuck Werner, Dan Rodoni, and veteran Lupe Soza. With the truck being in the Top 10 of top merchandise sales with Monster Jam, the team was expanded to now 4 trucks as of 2012. The trucks are similar in terms of body design, but each chassis is unique and different. Marc McDonald is considered the \\"leader\\" of the pact of trucks, and he drives the newest El Toro Loco of anybody, with a Carroll Racing Development (CRD) chassis, featuring a lower center-of-gravity design and a softer landing suspension. Becky McDonough drives a Patrick Enterprises Incorporated (PEI) chassis, that is a couple of years old, and has been used before in competition. Chuck Werner was a part of Meents Racing a few years before, so his chassis is a Willman-style chassis, with the engine in the front and the axles designed a little different from many others. Aaron Basl and Ryan Huffaker use to share driving duties with a Racesource designed chassis by monster truck racing legend Pablo Huffaker until 2014 where they pilot the Wolverine monster truck. In 2015, Becky McDonough drove the yellow El Toro Loco on the inaugural #MoreMonsterJam tour. Chuck Werner drove the red El Toro Loco on the new Fox Sports 1 Championship Series, and made history by scoring the first ever point on the series for being the fastest qualifier at Houston. He won freestyle in St. Louis a few weeks later. For 2016, a red El Toro Loco is run on the AMSOIL Series with rookie driver Mark List behind the wheel. Mark won the first overall event in 2016 at Tulsa, Oklahoma. Becky McDonough currently has two points on the FS1 Championship Series in the yellow El Toro Loco. Dan Rodoni put his two trucks up for sale and has not driven in 2016. In 2019, an El Toro Loco is run on Stadium Championship Series 2 in team ice for the Monster Jam Fire and Ice element. It is driven by former Team Hot Wheels Firestorm driver, Scott Buetow.

He was active during the Weimar period and is known for his theoretical works as well as his building designs.  Early life and career  Taut was born in K√∂nigsberg in 1880. After secondary school, he studied at the Baugewerkschule. In the following years, Taut worked in the offices of various architects in Hamburg and Wiesbaden. In 1903, he was employed by Bruno M√∂hring in Berlin, where he acquainted himself with Jugendstil and new building methods combining steel with masonry. From 1904 to 1908, Taut worked in Stuttgart for Theodor Fischer and studied urban planning. He received his first commission through Fischer in 1906, which involved the renovation of the village church in Unterriexingen. In 1908, he returned to Berlin to study art history and construction at the Royal Technical Higher School of Charlottenburg (K√∂niglich Technische Hochschule Charlottenburg), now the Technical University of Berlin. A year later, he established the architecture firm Taut & Hoffmann with Franz Hoffmann. Taut's first large projects came in 1913. He became a committed follower of the Garden City movement, evidenced by his design for the Falkenberg Estate.Architectural Theory / Edited by Harry Francis Mallgrave and Christina ContandriopoulosArchitectural Theory From The Renaƒ±ssance to The Present / Bernd Evers Taut adopted the futuristic ideals and techniques of the avant- garde as seen in the prismatic dome of the Glass Pavilion, which he built for the association of the German glass industry for the 1914 Werkbund Exhibition in Cologne. His aim was to make a whole building out of glass instead of merely using glass as a surface or decorative material. He created glass- treaded metal staircases, a waterfall with underlighting, and colored walls of mosaic glass. His sketches for the publication \\"Alpine Architecture\\" (1917) are the work of an unabashed utopian visionary, and he is classified as a Modernist and in particular an Expressionist. Much of Taut's literary work in German remains untranslated into English.  Germany  In 1910 after training in Berlin, working for Theodor Fischer's firm in Stuttgart, and establishing his own firm in Berlin, the experienced architect Hermann Muthesius suggested that Taut visit England to learn the garden city philosophy. Muthesius also introduced him to some of the Deutscher Werkbund group of architects, including Walter Gropius. Taut had socialist sympathies, and before World War I this hindered his advancement. Taut's practical activity changed with World War I. He became a pacifist and so avoided military service. He began to write and sketch, less to escape from the brutalities of war than to present a positive utopia in opposition to this reality. Taut designed an immense circular garden city with a radius of about 7 km (4.3 mi) for three million inhabitants. The \\"City Crown\\" was to be in the very center. \\"Mighty and inaccessible\\", it would have been the culmination of a community and cultural center, a skyscraper-like, purpose-free \\"crystal building\\". \\"The building contains nothing but one beautiful room which can be reached by either of two staircases to the right and to the left of the theatre and the little community center. How can I even begin to describe what it is only possible to construct!\\", said Taut of the City Crown. Interior of the Glass Dome Taut completed two housing projects in Magdeburg from 1912 through 1915, which were influenced directly by the humane functionalism and urban design solutions of the garden city philosophy. The reform estate, created for a housing trust, was built in 1912‚Äì15 in the southwest of Magdeburg. The estate consists of one-story terrace houses and was the first project in which Taut used colour as a design principle. The construction of the estate was continued by Carl Krayl. Taut served as a city architect in Magdeburg from 1921 to 1923. During his time a few residential developments were built, one of which was the Hermann Beims estate (1925‚Äì28) with 2,100 apartments. Taut designed the exhibition hall City and Countryside in 1921 with concrete trusses and a central skylight. Color variations of doors and entrances in the Hufeisensiedlung in Berlin (1925‚Äì1933) Onkel-Toms-H√ºtte, Wilskistrasse, Berlin A lifelong painter, Taut was distinguished from his European modernist contemporaries by his devotion to color. As in Magdeburg, he applied lively, clashing colors to his first major commission, the 1912 Gartenstadt Falkenberg housing estate in Berlin, which became known as the \\"Paint Box Estates\\". The 1914 Glass Pavilion, an illustration of the new possibilities of glass, was also brightly colored. The difference between Taut and his Modernist contemporaries was never more obvious than at the 1927 Weissenhofsiedlung housing exhibition in Stuttgart. In contrast to the pure-white entries from Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Walter Gropius, Taut's house (Number 19) was painted in primary colors. Le Corbusier is reported to have exclaimed, \\"My God, Taut is colour-blind!\\"Kirch, K., The Weissenhofsiedlung Rizzoli International Publications, 1989 In 1924 Taut was made chief architect of GEHAG, a Berlin public housing cooperative, and was the main designer of several successful large residential developments (\\"Gross-Siedlungen\\") in Berlin, notably the 1925 Hufeisensiedlung (\\"Horseshoe Estate\\"), named for its configuration around a pond, and the 1926 Onkel-Toms-H√ºtte development (\\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\") in Zehlendorf, named for a local restaurant and set in a thick grove of trees. Both of these constructions became prominent examples of the use of colorful details in architecture. Taut worked for the city architect of Berlin, Martin Wagner, on some of Berlin's Modernist Housing Estates, now recognized as UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The designs featured controversial modern flat roofs; access to sunlight, air, and gardens; and generous amenities like gas, electric light, and bathrooms. Political conservatives complained that these developments were too opulent for 'simple people'. The progressive Berlin mayor, Gustav B√∂ss, defended them: \\"We want to bring the lower levels of society higher.\\" Between 1924 and 1931, Taut's team completed more than 12,000 dwellings. In tribute to Taut, GEHAG incorporated an abstracted graphic of the Horseshoe Estate in its logo. This state housing association was sold by the Senate of Berlin in 1998; its legal successor is Deutsche Wohnen.  Japan  Being a noted advocate of socialist political policies, Taut was compelled to look for opportunities to emigrate from Germany when the Nazis gained power. He was promised work in the USSR in 1932 and 1933 but was obliged to return to Germany in February 1933 to a hostile political environment. Later in the same year, Taut fled to Switzerland. Then, with an invitation from Japanese architect Isaburo Ueno, he traveled to Japan via France, Greece, Turkey and Vladivostok, arriving in Tsuruga, Japan, on May 3, 1933. Taut made his home in Takasaki, Gunma, where he produced three influential book-length appreciations of Japanese culture and architecture, comparing the historical simplicity of Japanese architecture with modernist discipline. For a time Taut worked as an industrial design teacher, and his models of lamps and furniture sold at the Miratiss shop in Tokyo. Taut was noted for his appreciation of the stark, minimalist vein of Japanese architecture found at the Ise Shrine and the Katsura Imperial Villa in Kyoto. He was the first to write extensively about the architectural features of the Katsura Imperial Villa from a modernist perspective. Contrasting it with the elaborately decorated shrines of shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu at Nikk≈ç, Tochigi, he famously said that \\"Japan's architectural arts could not rise higher than Katsura, nor sink lower than Nikko\\". Taut's writing on the Japanese minimalist aesthetic found an appreciative audience in Japan and subsequently influenced the work of Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius. The only extant Taut-designed architectural work in Japan is the extension to the Hyuga Villa at Atami in Shizuoka. Built-in 1936 on a site below the original villa owned by businessman Rihei Hyuga, and part modern and part traditional Japanese in style, the three rooms provided additional space for social events and views over nearby Sagami Bay.  Turkey  Offered a position as Professor of Architecture at the State Academy of Fine Arts in Istanbul (currently, Mimar Sinan University of Fine Arts), Taut relocated to Turkey in 1936. In Ankara he joined other German wartime exiles, including Martin Wagner and Taut's associate Franz Hillinger, who arrived in 1938. Some of Taut's work was received unfavorably, however, and labeled as \\"cubic\\". In a letter to a Japanese friend he wrote, \\"They gave me a great opportunity in that they gave me freedom for my craft.

His studio resembled that of the Einstein Tower in Potsdam, while the front view recalled a Japanese pagoda. After leaving Germany, Taut gradually moved away from modernism. A colleague remarked that \\"Like everyone who gets old, Taut is stuck with Renaissance principles and cannot find a way towards the new! I am very disappointed...

For years, this stretch of road had only two side-by-side lanes and no emergency breakdown lane. Given the large amount of auto and farm machinery traffic the road carried, plus the high number of fatalities from vehicular accidents, the Commonwealth of Kentucky Department of Transportation opted to add two more lanes. In 1966, discussions were held about how best to widen the road. The original project razed historical structures and would mandate a four-lane divided highway with a uniform grassy median. Local citizens took the Transportation Cabinet to court to stop the plans. In 1977, the Bluegrass Land and Nature Trust stepped in to help oppose the plans. In 1979, an injunction was issued and the existing plans for widening were scrapped. The court issued a statement in that it wanted more considerate and careful alternatives that would preserve the highway's historic significance. In 1980, the Paris Pike widening project was cancelled. An injunction was issued. In 1986, proponents and opponents of the Paris Pike widening project met, agreeing to work together in order to improve the safety and capacity of the deadly road. Fatalities up to that point were increasing every year, claiming, for instance, a family of five in 1985. In 1990, Bluegrass Tomorrow created a committee of supporters and opponents of the Paris Pike project with hope that a compromise could be reached on how the roadway should be improved. Unfortunately, later that year the Kentucky Department of Transportation released their Record of Decision, in that the Paris Pike should be improved by widening the highway to four- lanes with a median, almost exactly like the plans in 1966 which were later cancelled. In 1991, in order to reach a compromise, a Memorandum of Agreement that was coordinated with the state transportation cabinet, the Federal Highway Administration, the National Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, and the Kentucky State Historic Preservation Office in order to satisfy Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act. The Memorandum of Agreement stated that several activities would need to occur before any design or construction on the Paris Pike would take place. Later in 1991, the U.S. District Court turned down a request by federal and state officials to lift portions of a 1979 injunction and denied the state transportation cabinet from selecting a design task force. During this time, a proposal by then governor Brereton Jones was derailed as it would have utilized an abandoned railroad corridor to the east of the existing Paris Pike. In 1992, the Paris Pike Committee was formed with representatives from Fayette and Bourbon counties and two preservation organizations. This new committee would later set specific guidelines regarding roadway design, land use, and preservation, stating that the new highway could be more beautiful than what currently existed. Later meetings extended those statements with a pact to preserve the land around the highway from development forever. Several of those design specifications called for a four-lane highway with grass shoulders, and where possible, the existing roadway would be used. The highway would flow with the contours of the landscape, and the existing rock walls and entryways would be preserved. Other features that were mentioned included guardrail considerations and landscaping. The final report from the Paris Pike Committee was signed off on in May 1993 and endorsed by all preservation and conservation groups who at one point were at odds over this widening project. The injunction was lifted in September 1993. Landscape architect Grant Jones and his Seattle-based firm, working with engineering consultant H. W. Lochner, Inc. of Lexington, designed the new Paris Pike utilizing the criteria set forth by the Paris Pike Committee.\\"Paris Lexington Road. Paris to Lexington, Kentucky.\\" American Society of Landscape Architects 2002 Merit Award (accessed April 21, 2011).Krista L. Schneider, The Paris-Lexington Road: Community-Based Planning and Context Sensitive Highway Design (Island Press, 2003), . Excerpts available at Google Books. The widening project began in 1997 and the four- lane divided highway was completed in 2003. The total budget for the project was $69.9 million, however, it was completed at a cost of $93 million or $4.5 million per mile, 1.8 times the cost of a typical four-lane highway in the state. As a result of the widening project, the level-of-service along the highway went from an overall grade of 'F' (failing) to 'A' (excellent) and became one of the most scenic byways in the nation. The desire by the designers of the highway, the general public, and the numerous preservation organizations to maintain the historic character of the corridor and to maintain its unique character made the cost extraordinarily high but it was well worth the cost. Dry-laid limestone rock fences were dismantled and reconstructed by hand, for instance, and extensive landscaping and tree planting using native species were utilized. As a result of this careful construction, the Paris Pike project won a 2002 Merit-Design award from the American Society of Landscape Architects as well as the 2003 Federal Highway Administration's Environmental Excellence Award and the National Partnership for Highway Quality 2003 State Award. A horse named after Paris Pike won the Scottish Grand National Steeplechase in 2001 before falling at the first fence in the famous 2002 Grand National at Aintree, England.

They were instrumental in the solidification of the minstrel show into a fixed three-act form.New York Times, September 14, 1855: during a legal dispute about the continuing use of the name 'Christy's Minstrels' after the departure of E.P.Christie, the surviving members of the troupe admitted to giving a performance at the Athenaeum hall, Brooklyn, on September 10, 1855 which \\"consisted of musical, terpsichorean and humorous exhibitions of an Ethiopian character.\\" The troupe also invented or popularized \\"the line\\", the structured grouping that constituted the first act of the standardized three-act minstrel show, with the interlocutor in the middle and \\"Mr. Tambo\\" and \\"Mr. Bones\\" on the ends.  Early years  In 1846 they first performed in Polmer's Opera House in New York City. From March 1847, they ran for a seven-year stint at New York City's Mechanics' Hall (until July 1854). After performing at a benefit performance for Stephen Foster in Cincinnati, Ohio, on August 25, 1847, the group specialized in performances of Foster's works. Foster sold his song \\"Old Folks at Home\\" to Christy for his exclusive use. The troupe's commercial success was phenomenal: Christy paid Foster for the exclusive rights to the song.Lott, 1993, 267 Besides Christy himself, the troupe originally included Christy's stepson George Christy, often considered the greatest blackface comic of the era. When by September 1855 George and Edwin Christy had retired from the group, the company continued under the name of 'Christy's Minstrels', until Edwin Christy took out an injunction to prevent them.According to the New York Times report, Edwin Christy took out an injunction against the troupe calling themselves 'Christy's Minstrels' \\"though there was no person among them by the name of Christy.\\" The troupe, then headed by a Joseph Murphy, did perform on September 10th as 'Christy's Minstrels' and were sued for contempt of court. The judge, Mr Justice Clerke, dismissed the contempt charge after the defendants claimed they had announced to the audience prior to the performance that they were not now 'Christy's Minstrels' and had expressed an intention of continuing under a different name. New York Times September 14, 1855:'LAW INTELLIGENCE: MINSTRELS IN COURT' Christy was emotionally affected by the American Civil War, and committed suicide in 1862. In Britain and Ireland 1874 Advertisement J. W. Raynor and Earl Pierce formed a new troupe, using many of the former Christy Minstrel members. It opened in London, England, as \\"Raynor & Pierce's Christy Minstrels\\" at the St. James's Theatre on 3 August 1857. They then performed at the Surrey Theatre and later the \\"Polygraphic Hall\\" on King William Street, where they appeared for ten months. \\"Nellie Grey\\" by Michael Balfe, as sung by Raynor, became popular. In 1859, the troupe moved to the St. James's Hall (Liverpool), performing for another four months and then touring the British provinces. It then returned to Polygraphic Hall, disbanding in August 1860. The success of this troupe led to the phrase \\"Christy Minstrels\\" coming to mean any blackface minstrel show. Soon, four new companies were formed, each claiming to be the \\"original\\" Christy Minstrels, because they each boasted one or two former members of the old troupe. One group played in Dublin at the Chester Theatre in 1864, moving to London at the Standard Theatre in Shoreditch in 1865. The Dublin performances were evidently popular enough that James Joyce mentions them in his short story collection Dubliners and alludes to them on the opening page of Finnegans Wake. Three months later, it moved to St. James's Hall, where it began a run of 35 years until 1904. Eventually, the original members of that troupe retired or died, leaving only \\"Pony\\" Moore and Frederic Burgess surviving into the 1870s. Therefore, the troupe changed its name to the \\"Moore & Burgess's Minstrels\\". Other groups continued to use the title \\"Christy\\", but historian Frank Andrews describes their quality as poor. Some of them continued to perform into the twentieth century.Article by Michael Walters, citing Andrews, Frank, Talking Machine Review, November 1977 issue Performance style Christy's novel three-part shows began with a \\"walkaround\\", the company marching onto the stage singing and dancing. A staple of the walkaround was the cakewalk, which white audiences loved despite not realizing that it originated with plantation slaves imitating their masters' walks. The troupe was then seated in a semicircle, with one member on each end playing the tambourine or the bones. The endmen were named Brother Tambo and Brother Bones, and they engaged in an exchange of jokes between the group's songs and dances. It was customary for Tambo to be slim and Bones to be fat. A character called Mr. Interlocutor sat in the middle of the group, acting as the master of ceremonies. As the interlocutor took his place in the middle of the semicircle he uttered the time-honored phrase: \\"Gentlemen, be seated. We will commence with the overture.\\" During the performance he conducted himself in a dignified manner that contrasted well with the behavior of the rowdy endmen. Part two (the \\"olio\\") was the variety section, a precursor to vaudeville. It included singers, dancers, comedians and other novelty acts, as well as parodies of legitimate theater. A preposterous stump speech served as the highlight of this act, during which a performer spoke in outrageous malapropisms as he lectured. The performer's demeanor was meant to be reminiscent of the hilarious pomposity of Zip Coon; he aspired to great wisdom and intelligence, but his hilarious mangling of language always made him appear foolish and ignorant. Part three ended the show with a one-act play, typically a vignette of carefree life on the plantation. After Uncle Tom's Cabin was published in 1852 and the play became famous, minstrel shows appropriated the major characters for sketches that changed the abolitionist themes in the original into an argument for the supposedly benign character of slavery. New Christy Minstrels The New Christy Minstrels, a folk group from the 1960s, were named with reference to this group, but they did not perform in blackface.

Its alignment runs from southeast to northwest and roughly corresponds to part of the once-proposed Outer Beltway around Washington, D.C. The first segment of the roadway opened in 1987; the road was completed in 2010. The Franconia‚ÄìSpringfield Parkway (SR 289, formerly SR 7900) is a short east-west spur near the south end of SR 286, leading east through Springfield and serving the Franconia‚ÄìSpringfield Metro station. While SR 286 has access to the main lanes of I-95 (Shirley Highway), SR 289 interchanges with the reversible HOV lanes in the median of I-95. Route description The Fairfax County Parkway and its branch to Franconia generally have interchanges at major roads, traffic signals intermediate roads, and right-in/right-out (RIRO) intersections with minor roads and neighborhood streets. Along the main parkway (SR 286), there are 17 full or partial interchanges and 39 signals, with eleven of those signals at interchanges; the Franconia‚ÄìSpringfield Parkway (SR 289) has five interchanges and only three signals. In addition, there are many unsignalized intersections along the road, but none of these are driveways, since the road is limited-access.Google Maps street maps and satellite imagery, accessed October 2007 The road generally has a speed limit of . = Fairfax County Parkway (VA 286) = leftFranklin Farm The south end of SR 286 begins at an intersection with US 1 at Accotink and heads northwest through Fort Belvoir, leaving the fort at a diamond interchange with Telegraph Road (SR 611), crossing I-95 at a full cloverleaf (exit 166), crossing over Fullerton Road, passing through interchanges with Boudinot Drive and Barta Road, and turning west through West Springfield at Rolling Road. This portion replaced the existing Backlick Road (SR 617), which continues north from the I-95 interchange and connects to the Franconia‚ÄìSpringfield Parkway (SR 289). During most of the parkway's life, the portion between Fullerton Road and SR 289 had not been constructed due to delay caused by environmental issues, including an oil spill along its path through the Fort Belvoir Proving Ground. Since approval in 2008, construction began in 2009 and the new portion was opened in late 2010. After merging with the Spur, there is in interchange with Hooes and Pohick Roads (SR 636/SR 641). Continuing northwest to the interchange with Ox Road (SR 123), SR 286 is a surface road, built directly on the former Pohick Road. The parkway beyond Ox Road was built on a new alignment, and has a much smaller number of intersections. Just past Ox Road, SR 286 passes under Clara Barton Drive, a minor residential street. It intersects the west end of Burke Center Parkway (SR 643), crosses over the Virginia Railway Express Manassas Line and Fairfax Station Road (SR 660), and intersects several other roads before a freeway section begins at a folded diamond interchange with Braddock Road (SR 620). A complicated three-level diamond takes SR 286 over Lee Highway (US 29) at the south end of West Ox Road (SR 608), and SR 286 crosses I-66 at exit 55, a cloverleaf. After passing over Fair Lakes Circle (SR 7701), there is a diamond interchange with Fair Lakes Parkway (SR 7700) and Monument Drive (SR 7969). The next interchange, at Lee Jackson Memorial Highway (US 50), is a partial cloverleaf with two signals on SR 286. From US 50 to Franklin Farm Road, the parkway curves northwest to reach the Outer Beltway right-of-way. This straight path is followed until Baron Cameron Avenue (SR 606), and includes an overpass at Pinecrest Road in the Fox Mill Estates neighborhood. After crossing the Dulles Access Road (SR 267), SR 286 follows the east border of Herndon, with interchanges at Sunset Hills Road (SR 675) and Baron Cameron Avenue (SR 606). The parkway leaves the straight Outer Beltway alignment just beyond Baron Cameron Avenue, curving northwest and north to end at a diamond interchange with Leesburg Pike (SR 7), at which the traffic signals are on SR 286. Algonkian Parkway continues north as a four-lane local road, eventually curving back west and south to SR 7 just east of SR 28. SR 286 is also known as the John F. (Jack) Herrity Parkway, designated by the Virginia General Assembly in 1995, and the Trooper Charles Mark Cosslett Memorial Highway, designated in 2010 as the final link through Fort Belvoir. In 2001, SR 289 was named the Joseph V. Gartlan Jr. Parkway. Jack Herrity served for 12 years on the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, and was instrumental in getting the road built; Joseph V. Gartlan Jr. was a state senator who served Fairfax County for 28 years. These names are ceremonial, and are rarely used by the public. =Fairfax County Parkway Trail= The Fairfax County Parkway Trail is a multi-use trail that runs alongside the Franconia‚ÄìSpringfield Parkway and Fairfax County Parkway from Beulah Street in Springfield to SR 7, mostly as a sidepath, but sometimes using adjacent frontage roads and old alignments of the roads that the parkway replaced. It intersects the Washington and Old Dominion Trail north of Sunset Hills Road at Herndon, near that trail's mile 19. The final section of the trail was opened in 2002. = Franconia‚ÄìSpringfield Parkway (VA 289) = Franconia‚ÄìSpringfield Parkway crossing Accotink Creek SR 289 begins at an intersection with Beulah Street (SR 613), with Manchester Boulevard/Kingstowne Boulevard continuing east to Van Dorn Street. The road heads west, with interchanges at the Franconia‚ÄìSpringfield Metro/VRE station, Frontier Drive, the Shirley Highway reversible HOV lanes, and Backlick Road (SR 617). At the Rolling Road (SR 638) interchange, SR 289 ends and merges with SR 286. Rolling Road south of the interchange was rebuilt to carry SR 286, and a large loop ramp is designed for northbound SR 286 traffic. Beyond this interchange, SR 286 has two diamond interchanges, with Sydenstricker Road/Gambrill Road (SR 640) and Pohick Road (SR 641)/Hooes Road (SR 636), before a stretch of several miles with only at- grade intersections. From Backlick Road (SR 617) west to this SR 636 interchange, the parkway paralleled and replaced the existing Hooes Road (SR 636). History =Planning= The Outer Beltway was first planned in 1950 as the \\"Cross Country Loop\\", part of the National Capital Planning Commission's comprehensive plan. In Virginia, by the time of a 1965 plan, shows an earlier plan in Prince William County to the south it was to run through southern and western Fairfax County, crossing the Potomac River at Mason Neck and north of Great Falls, and passing generally west of State Route 123 (Ox Road) and east of SR 645 (Clifton Road, Stringfellow Road, and Lees Corner Road). The straight part of the Fairfax County Parkway between south of Franklin Farm Road and north of Baron Cameron Avenue is built where the beltway would have been. During the 1970s, attention was focused on the Metrorail system, and environmental concerns temporarily pushed the Outer Beltway onto the back burner. In the 1980s and 1990s, when the plan was revived as the Western Transportation Corridor, the route was shifted further west. View west along SR 289 at SR 613 in Franconia The idea for the Springfield Bypass started in the 1970s as a bypass of SR 644 (Old Keene Mill Road) in Springfield. It was soon expanded, by 1978, to include most of what had been planned as the Outer Beltway. The Commonwealth Transportation Board approved final plans on July 16, 1987 for the road, with 16 interchanges and 35 traffic signals between U.S. Route 1 at Fort Belvoir and State Route 7 near Dranesville. A spur to Franconia was included, providing access to the Shirley Highway HOV lanes and the Franconia‚ÄìSpringfield Metrorail station. Except for a short six-lane piece in Reston, the $242 million plan included only four lanes. Since it was a surface road, the highway could incorporate existing roads. This included portions of SR 617 (Backlick Road), SR 636 (Hooes Road), SR 641 (Pohick Road), and SR 680 (Stuart Road). Fifty-five homes and five businesses had to be taken by eminent domain to build the road. Included in these 55 homes were five at the brand-new Innisfree subdivision in Springfield. Only months after families moved into the houses, located between SR 636 (Hooes Road) and the proposed highway, they were informed that their land would be needed for the interchange at SR 640 (Sydenstricker Road). Originally planned as an at-grade intersection, projections of increased traffic led to a redesign that required more right-of-way. The Fairfax County Board of Supervisors changed the name to the Fairfax County Parkway on June 23, 1988, noting that it traveled far from Springfield. The Franconia Spur was not renamed to the suggested Springfield Parkway at that time, to give time to find a single name for the entire spur, already known as Kingstowne Boulevard at its east end. By the next year, the permanent Franconia‚ÄìSpringfield Parkway name had been applied to the portion west of State Route 613 (Beulah Street); the rest of the road was not built as part of the project, and now carries the Manchester Boulevard and Kingstowne Boulevard names. =Construction= SR 286 in Reston ;I-66 to Herndon (1987‚Äì1993) Three bond issues were approved by Fairfax County voters to pay for construction of the highway, as well as other roads in the county: $135 million in November 1985, $150 million in April 1988, and $130 million in November 1992. The first portions of the road to open were financed by developers building in the area: the Cavalier Land Development Corporation from a new interchange on Interstate 66 north to U.S. Route 50, and the Hazel/Peterson Companies from Stringfellow Road north to Franklin Farm Road, both completed in 1987. On October 24, 1989, the gap from US 50 to Stringfellow Road was filled, and the road was extended from Franklin Farm Road north to West Ox Road (SR 608). It was further extended north to a new interchange on the Dulles Toll Road (SR 267) on October 22, 1991, and north to Sunset Hills Road (SR 675) on July 7, 1993. ;Franconia‚ÄìSpringfield Parkway (1989‚Äì1995) View east at the west end of SR 289 where it junctions with SR 286 The first piece of the Franconia‚ÄìSpringfield Parkway, a short bypass of Hooes Road (SR 636) from Rolling Road (SR 638) east over Accotink Creek to near Lackawanna Drive, opened on August 7, 1989. The rest of this spur to Beulah Street (SR 613) in Franconia opened on June 8, 1992, along with the reversible HOV ramps to the Shirley Highway (I-95/I-395). (The Franconia‚ÄìSpringfield station did not open for Virginia Railway Express and Metrorail trains until four and five years later, respectively; the interchange at Frontier Drive serving the station opened in December 1995). ;Springfield to I-66 (1993‚Äì1996) The next pieces of the road to open were in the southwest, with an upgrade and bypass of Hooes Road (SR 636) from Pohick Road (SR 641) east to Rolling Road (SR 638) and the Franconia‚ÄìSpringfield Parkway opening by November 1993. notes problems with cut-through traffic due to the forced right turn from northbound Pohick Road onto the parkway The highway from Ox Road (SR 123) north to Braddock Road (SR 620) opened on July 28, 1995, and was connected to the existing portion at I-66 on September 19. Two interchanges along this portion and the older one to the north ‚Äì at US 50 and at US 29 ‚Äì opened on December 14 and December 20 respectively. From SR 123 southeast to the beginning of the Franconia‚ÄìSpringfield Parkway, existing two- lane roads were widened, opening the road from SR 123 east to Lee Chapel Road (SR 643) by May 1996 and to Pohick Road (SR 641) on July 2, 1996, completing the road from Springfield to Herndon. However, until a new bridge opened in early September 2002, traffic on Pohick Road northbound (just east of Hooes Road) was required to turn right onto the parkway. ;US 1 to I-95 (1997) and Herndon to SR 7 (1999‚Äì2001) The southernmost portion, from US 1 north across I-95 to Fullerton Road, mostly an upgrade of Backlick Road (SR 617), opened south of Telegraph Road (SR 611) by July 1997 and north of Telegraph Road later that year. The first part north of Sunset Hills Road (SR 675), a short piece from the new interchange with SR 7 south to Sugarland Road (SR 604), opened by June 1999. The parkway was extended south from Sugarland Road to Wiehle Avenue (SR 828) on November 1, 2000. The road was extended to Walnut Branch with two lanes extended to Baron Cameron Avenue (SR 606) on December 21, 2000. The gap between Walnut Branch and Sunset Hills was filled on November 5, 2001, finally completing the parkway north of Springfield. ;I-95 to Springfield (2009‚Äì2012) Construction has been delayed many times on the last segment, between Fullerton Road (just north of I-95) and Rolling Road (SR 638), which will allow traffic on the main part of the parkway to connect directly to the I-95 main lanes. Plans were made here in the late 1980s, and it was to be paid for by a developer who was to build a development on land bought from the U.S. Army's Fort Belvoir. But those plans fell through, and traffic growth necessitated a redesign. Plans were again postponed in the early 2000s due to necessary environmental cleanup of that part of Fort Belvoir, which included unexploded ordnance. The Environmental Protection Agency discovered in 2005 that an oil spill on the property had not been properly cleaned. , the project had been designed as a full freeway but was placed on hold.{(cite web publisher=Virginia Department of Transportation url=http://www.virginiadot.org/projects/const-project.asp?ID%3D62 title=Fairfax County Parkway Extension accessdate=July 31, 2007}] As of September 2010, this portion of the parkway opened for traffic, closing the gap that once existed. ;Future improvements Plans have been made for an interchange at Fair Lakes Parkway, just north of I-66. This project will be funded with American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 funds. This project was certified on August 10, 2009, and the construction contract is expected to be let August 2010. Furthermore, improvements are being made to the West Ox Road and Sunrise Valley Drive intersections with the parkway along with interchanges with the new portion of the parkway between Fullerton Road and Rolling Road at Boudinot Drive. Additions and improvements to the I-95 interchange with Fairfax County Parkway are currently under development as well. =Designation as primary state highway= On February 16, 2012, the Fairfax County Parkway was designated SR 286 and the Franconia‚ÄìSpringfield Parkway was designated SR 289.

These included the Monster Jam monster truck series as well as motocross, quad racing and others. Having passed through multiple owners, the rights to the group are now owned by Feld Entertainment,Feld Entertainment Acquires Live Nation Motor Sports which continues to operate the Monster Jam series. History The USHRA was founded as \\"Truck-O-Rama\\" in the late 1970s by Bob George, Ed Thayer, and Tony Vaccaro. By the early 1980s, the company became known as SRO Motorsports, and began promoting events under the USHRA banner. The early events focused on tractor pulling and mud bogging, and were primarily held in stadiums and arenas. Often, specialty vehicles were booked for events as intermission entertainment between competitions. In 1982, one such vehicle, Bob Chandler's Bigfoot, was booked for an event at the Pontiac Silverdome. It was that event, during which Bigfoot drove over a pair of cars in its first stadium car crush, that launched the phenomenon of monster trucks. In 1985, USHRA held their first monster truck racing event, The Battle of the Monster Trucks, at the Louisiana Superdome. Up to this point, monster trucks had only performed freestyle exhibitions, and although for several years exhibitions would be a part of smaller arena shows, racing became used in all events by the early 1990s. Although monster trucks grew in popularity throughout the 1980s, tractor pulling and mud bogging (subsequently known as \\"mud racing\\") remained marquee events. Popular pullers included Art Arfons, who competed with the \\"Green Monster\\" unlimited tractor, David Willoughby, who pulled with his reputable \\"Back in Time\\" modified four-wheel-drive truck, Kenneth and Paula Geuin's Black Gold and Oklahoman four-wheel-drive trucks, Allen Gaines, who had an entire fleet of \\"Orange Blossom Special\\" truck pullers, and Gary Collins and his \\"Budweiser Boss\\" semi-truck. In mud racing, Tom Martin's \\"Mud Patrol\\" and \\"Super Trooper\\" police-themed vehicles dominated for several years, while a young Tom Meents began his rise to fame in the \\"Shake Me\\" machine. In 1991, the parent company, now known as SRO/Pace, bought out competitor TNT Motorsports, and in the process acquired the rights to promote events at several more venues, as well as the booking rights to several of their best known trucks, including Carolina Crusher, Equalizer, and, most notably, Grave Digger. These trucks all competed in the \\"Camel Mud & Monster Series\\", which ran from 1990 to 1994. By the end of the Camel series, monster trucks were the headlining competitors. In 1993, USHRA produced the syndicated television show \\"Monster Wars\\", which was controversial for its implementation of professional wrestling style characters representing the monster trucks. This was also the year that some events began to be promoted with the name \\"Monster Jam\\", which would become the official series name in 1995. 1998 saw competitor USA Motorsports bought out by USHRA's parent, now known as Pace Motorsports, which led to Monster Jam events being shown on TNN's Motor Madness television show. In 1998, Pace was bought by SFX Entertainment, which was bought in turn by Clear Channel in 2000. The live events division of Clear Channel was split off as Live Nation in 2005, and the motorsports division was sold to Feld Entertainment in 2008. Under Feld ownership, all events except Monster Jam and the AMA Supercross Championship, which is sanctioned by the American Motorcyclist Association, have been discontinued, and the USHRA name has largely been phased out in favor of the better known Monster Jam name.

Cisco Bridges - CPR bridge (black) in foreground, CNR bridge (orange arch) in background (with CPR train on it). Photo facing upriver. The Fraser Canyon is a major landform of the Fraser River where it descends rapidly through narrow rock gorges in the Coast Mountains en route from the Interior Plateau of British Columbia to the Fraser Valley. Colloquially, the term \\"Fraser Canyon\\" is often used to include the Thompson Canyon from Lytton to Ashcroft, since they form the same highway route which most people are familiar with, although it is actually reckoned to begin above Williams Lake, British Columbia at Soda Creek Canyon near the town of the same name. Geology The canyon was formed during the Miocene period (23.7‚Äì5.3 million years ago) by the river cutting into the uplifting Interior Plateau. From the northern Cariboo to Fountain, the river follows the line of the huge Fraser Fault, which runs on a north-south axis and meets the Yalakom Fault a few miles downstream from Lillooet. Exposures of lava flows are present in cliffs along the Fraser Canyon. They represent volcanic activity in the southern Chilcotin Group during the Pliocene period and the volcanic vents of their origins have not been discovered. Geography View of Fraser Canyon in the area of the Kwioek Creek (the valley coming in at left) The canyon extends north of Yale to the confluence of the Chilcotin River. Its southern stretch is a major transportation corridor to the Interior from \\"the Coast\\", with the Canadian National and Canadian Pacific Railways and the Trans-Canada Highway carved out of its rock faces, with many of the canyon's side-crevasses spanned by bridges and trestles. Prior to the double-tracking of those railways and major upgrades to Highway 1 (the Trans Canada Highway), travel through the canyon was even more precarious than it is now. During the frontier era it was a major obstacle between the Lower Mainland and the Interior Plateau, and the slender trails along its rocky walls - many of them little better than notches cut into granite, with a few handholds - were compared to goat-tracks. North of Lytton, it is followed by BC Highway 12, then from Lillooet to Pavilion by BC Hwy 99 (the farther end of the Sea-to-Sky Highway, though not carrying that name in this area). The British Columbia Railway (the BC Railway is now owned and operated by the CN) line follows the same stretch of canyon from Lillooet to just beyond Pavilion. Between there and the mouth of the Chilcotin River there are only rough ranching roads, and the terrain is a mix of canyon depths flanked by arid benchland and high plateau. Between Pavilion and Lillooet, the river's gorge is at its maximum depth, with the river throttled through a series of narrow gorges flanked by high cliffs, though still flanked above those cliffs by wide benchlands which stand on the foreshoulder of the mountain ranges flanking the gorge. =Hells Gate= View of Hells Gate looking downstream, c.1955 At Hells Gate, near Boston Bar, the canyon walls rise about above the rapids. Fish ladders along the river's side permit migrating salmon to bypass a rockslide that diverted the river during the blasting of the Canadian Northern Railway line in 1913. The area around Hell's Gate carries the name Black Canyon, which may either be a reference to the colour of the rocks when it rains, or the name of a community built on the cliffsides here during the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush. At the site that once housed railway workers, a tourist attraction built in 1971 takes visitors across Hell's Gate via an aerial tramway. CPR steam locomotive in background passing old railway housing, c.1945 At Siska, a few minutes south of Lytton, there are the Cisco bridges‚Äîa pair of railway bridges at the throat of a rocky gorge. From south to north, the Canadian Pacific has been on the west side of the canyon, while the Canadian National has been on the east side. At Siska, the two railways switch sides: the CP‚Äî truss bridge‚Äîcrosses to the east, the CN‚Äîon a steel-arched bridge over the CP‚Äîis now on the west. The two railways now have an agreement to allow directional running through the canyon as far as Basque. All eastbound trains‚ÄîCN, CP, and Via Rail's eastbound Canadian‚Äîrun on the CP line. All westbound trains‚ÄîCN, CP, Via Rail's westbound Canadian‚Äîuse the CN tracks. =Upper Fraser Canyon= Just north of Lillooet, narrow rock ledges choke the river just at the confluence of the lower canyon of the Bridge River, forming an obstacle to migrating fish that has made this spot the busiest aboriginal fishing site on the river, from ancient times to the present. Concentrations of First Nations people here, from all tribes of the Interior, were believed to have been in excess of 10,000. =Sub-canyons= Many stretches of the Fraser are named in their own right, starting with the Little Canyon between Yale and Spuzzum, which is officially the lowest reach of the Fraser Canyon (although in regional terms Hope, farther south, is considered a canyon town and to be the southern outlet of the canyon because the highway became more difficult from that point; the river is navigable to Yale). Between the Spuzzum and Boston Bar was known in the gold rush as the Big Canyon or Black Canyon;BCGNIS entry \\"Black Canyon\\" there are several named subcanyons of the Big Canyon, most famously Hells Gate Canyon (in some descriptions the Black Canyon is below Hell's Gate). Above the Big Canyon there are the Lillooet Canyon, Fountain Canyon, Glen Fraser Canyon, Moran Canyon, High Bar Canyon, French Bar Canyon and more all the way up to Soda Creek Canyon near Quesnel. Upstream from there the river flows in wider country, but in the Robson Valley between Prince George and T√™te Jaune Cache, the river enters the Grand Canyon of the Fraser. The Black Canyon was the site of a shantytown of the same name, much of which was on catwalks on the ramparts of its dark-rock cliffs. Nearly all tributaries of the Fraser have canyons of varying scale; the few exceptions include the Pitt and the Chilliwack in the Lower Fraser Valley. The Thompson Canyon, from Lytton to Ashcroft, is a sequence of large canyons of its own, some of them also named, although most British Columbians and travellers think of it as part of the Fraser Canyon. Other important canyons on tributaries include Coquihalla Canyon, the Bridge River Canyon, Seton Canyon and adjacent Cayoosh Canyon, Pavilion Canyon, Vermilion Canyon (Slok Creek) and Churn Creek Canyon. The Chilcotin River also has several subcanyons, as does the Chilko River, notably Lava Canyon and another Black Canyon. =Upper canyons= There are other canyons on the Fraser that are not considered part of the canyon, notably at Soda Creek, between Williams Lake and Prince George. The official but comparatively diminutive Grand Canyon of the Fraser is in the river's upper stretch through the Rocky Mountain Trench, about 115 km (71 mi) upstream from Prince George and about 20 km (12 mi) upstream from the Fraser's confluence with the Bowron River. Despite its name, the Grand Canyon of the Fraser is only one treacherous switchback rapid in a shallow rock gorge, and it has neither the roughness of water nor the depth and severity of canyon as is found in the area south from Big Bar to Lillooet or between Boston Bar and Yale. Almost all of the rivers and creeks feeding the Fraser from Williams Lake south have their own canyons which open onto the Fraser, or are just up side-valleys a few miles. These include Marble Canyon, Churn Creek, the Chilcotin River, the Bridge River, Seton Lake and Cayoosh Creek, the Stein River, the Nahatlatch River, the Coquihalla River and the innumerable smaller creeks flanking the river between Kanaka Bar and Yale. =Tunnels= The Canadian Pacific Railway has at least 30 tunnels in its Yale to Lytton section with one up to half a mile in length. The Fraser Canyon Highway Tunnels were constructed from the spring of 1957 to 1964 as part of the Trans-Canada Highway project. There are seven tunnels in total, the shortest being about ; the longest, however, is about and is one of North America's longest. They are situated between Yale and Boston Bar. In order from south to north, they are: Yale (completed 1963), Saddle Rock (1958), Sailor Bar (1959), Alexandra (1964), Hell's Gate (1960), Ferrabee (1964) and China Bar (1961). The Hell's Gate tunnel is the only tunnel that does not have lights, while the China Bar tunnel is the only tunnel that requires ventilation. The China Bar and Alexandra tunnels have warning lights that are activated by cyclists before they enter the tunnels. This was required because the tunnels are curved. It is expected that the Ferrabee tunnel will get the same warning lights as it too is curved. History At the mouth of the Canyon, an archeological site documents the presence of the St√≥:l≈ç people in the area from the early Holocene period, 8,000 to 10,000 years ago after the retreat of the Fraser Glacier. Research farther upriver at the Keatley Creek Archaeological Site, near Pavilion, is dated to 8000 BP, when a huge lake filled what is now the canyon above Lillooet, created by a slide a few miles south of the present-day town. During the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush of 1858‚Äì1860, 10,500 miners and an untold number of hangers-on populated its banks and towns. The Fraser Canyon War and the series of events known as McGowan's War occurred during the gold rush. Other important histories connected with the Canyon include the building of the Cariboo Wagon Road and the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway. The river is navigable between Boston Bar and Lillooet and also between Big Bar Ferry and Prince George and beyond, although rapids at Soda Canyon and elsewhere were still difficult waters for the many steamboats which piloted the river in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The first sternwheeler to pass the rapids was Skuzzy, which was built with a multiple-compartment hull to preserve her from sinking from rock damage. She was used to haul equipment and supplies during the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway, beginning in the 1880s. With the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway in the 1880s came the destruction of key portions of the Cariboo Wagon Road, as there was no room for both railway and road on the narrow, steep mountainsides above the river. As a result, the towns of Lytton and Boston Bar were cut off from road access with the rest of the province, other than by the difficult wagon road to Lillooet via Fountain. During the automotive age and following the construction of the Canadian Northern Railway in 1904‚Äì05, a newer version of the road was built through the canyon. The Fraser Canyon Highway was surveyed in 1920 and constructed in 1924‚Äì25 with a through-route available after the completion of the (second) Alexandra Suspension Bridge in 1926. This was known as the Cariboo Highway and Highway 1 until the construction and designation of the Trans-Canada Highway (circa-1962).

The Journal was founded in Portland by C. S. \\"Sam\\" Jackson, publisher of Pendleton, Oregon's East Oregonian newspaper, after a group of Portlanders convinced Jackson to help in the reorganization of the Portland Evening Journal. The firm owned several radio stations in the Portland area, as well. In 1961, the Journal was purchased by S.I. Newhouse and Advance Publications, owners also of The Oregonian, the city's morning newspaper. Founding The Portland Evening Journal was first published on March 10, 1902.Corning, Howard M. Dictionary of Oregon History. Binfords & Mort Publishing, 1956. This newspaper began as a campaign paper owned by A. D. Bowen, with William Wasson as the first editor. However, within a few months the paper had floundered and was being liquidated. In July 1902, the Evening Journal, was taken over by C.S. \\"Sam\\" Jackson, who had been the publisher of the East Oregonian based in Pendleton. Jackson renamed the paper The Oregon Daily Journal. In his first editorial as publisher of the Journal, on July 23, 1902, Jackson declared: > \\"The Journal in head and heart will stand for the people, be truly > Democratic and free from political entanglements and machinations, believing > in the principles that promise the greatest good to the greatest number - to > ALL MEN, regardless of race, creed or previous condition of servitude.... It > shall be a FAIR newspaper and not a dull and selfish sheet - [and] a credit > to 'Where rolls the Oregon' country.\\" The Journal at its height Sam Jackson served as the Journal's editor and publisher for 22 years, from July 1902 until his death in 1924. He was succeeded by his son, Philip L. Jackson, who, following his father's footsteps, ran the newspaper for 29 years, expanding into broadcasting. Under the Jacksons' leadership, the Journal competed with the state's major newspaper, The Oregonian, also based in Portland, with the Journal touting itself as the \\"strong voice of the Oregon Country.\\" The paper was involved in a number of early 20th century crusades for reform, including better control of Oregon timberlands, adoption of the initiative, referendum and recall laws, direct election of U.S. senators, pure milk, and dredging of the Columbia River navigation channel to allow development of Portland as a major world port. The Journal ventured into radio, purchasing KOIN radio (AM 970). In 1932, the Journal purchased its second station, KALE. In 1946 KOIN was sold to Field Enterprises, In 1947, the Journal became the first newspaper in the country to employ a helicopter on a regular basis to gather news photographs. On June 6, 1948, KALE became KPOJ, standing for, Portland Oregon Journal. Also on this date KPOJ-FM was launched. The Journal's circulation peaked in 1948, with daily sales of 201,421 and Sunday circulation of 217,808.Crick, Rolla J. (September 4, 1982). \\"Journal ends 80 years of service\\". Oregon Journal. Transition and decline In 1953, Philip Jackson died from a heart disease. William W. Knight, who had been the paper's legal counsel, was brought in as its new publisher. C.S. Jackson's widow, Maria Clopton Jackson, died just a few years later, in 1956.The Jackson Foundation, \\"The Jackson Foundation: Created by Maria C. Jackson\\" Accessed: May 27, 2012. With the successive deaths of C.S. Jackson II, Philip Jackson, and Maria Jackson, no family heirs were left to oversee the business and its operations. In this era, afternoon newspapers began their decline due to the rise of television, changing commuting patterns and other forces. The paper's economic vitality was further sapped by a lengthy strike against both Portland newspapers that began in November 1959. The newspapers published a joint strike edition, but while separate publication of the Journal resumed in 1960, its circulation never approached pre-strike levels. Although the will of C.S. Jackson's widow, Maria Clopton Jackson, had specified that the newspaper's stock should be transferred to its employees upon her death, the trustees of her estate challenged that decision in court. Eventually, the courts ruled that the provision was written in wishful, not binding language. In 1961 the trustees, believing that losses from the strike could bankrupt the paper and deprive the foundation of much of its principal, sold the Journal to The Oregonian's publisher, S. I. Newhouse, for $8 million. This amount was twice the bid made by an Oregon group. Newhouse had acquired The Oregonian, Portland's morning daily, in 1950. Newhouse consolidated production and business operations of the two newspapers in The Oregonian's building while keeping their editorial staffs separate. As a result of the Newhouse acquisition, publication of the Journal's Sunday edition was discontinued. The company's radio stations were sold in 1961 to make way for the Journal's sale. The Journal never recovered the readership lost in the 1959 strike. Its circulation steadily declined through the 1960s and 1970s. Final decade(s) William Knight continued as publisher, retiring in 1971. Other key creative forces in the paper's final decades included Editor Donald J.

From 1902 to 1912, it was headquartered in the Goodnough Building at Fifth and Yamhill Streets. In 1912, the newspaper moved to a 12-story building it had constructed at Southwest Broadway and Yamhill Streets. (The building, now known as Jackson Tower, has been on the National Register of Historic Places since 1996.) The paper had outgrown that structure by the 1940s, and in 1948, the Journal moved to a three-block-long structure on SW Front Avenue that had originally been constructed in 1933 as the Portland Public Market. That building was the paper's home until the Newhouse acquisition in 1961. It was torn down in 1969 and is now the site of Tom McCall Waterfront Park.

According to the 19th-century fencing master Louis Rondelle,Rondelle, Louis, Foil and sabre; a grammar of fencing in detailed lessons for professor and pupil, Estes and Lauriat, Boston, 1892. > A classical fencer is supposed to be one who observes a fine position, whose > attacks are fully developed, whose hits are marvelously accurate, his > parries firm and his ripostes executed with precision. One must not forget > that this regularity is not possible unless the adversary is a party to it. > It is a conventional bout, which consists of parries, attacks, and returns, > all rhyming together. Used in this sense, classical fencing is a style of historical fencing focusing on the 19th- and early 20th-century national fencing schools, especially in Italy and France, i.e. the schools out of which the styles of contemporary sports fencing have developed. Masters and legendary fencing figures such as Giuseppe Radaelli, Louis Rondelle, Masaniello Parise, the Greco brothers, Aldo Nadi and his rival Lucien Gaudin are today considered typical practitioners of this period. Classical fencing weapons included the standard foil, √©p√©e (using pointes d'arret), and sabre (including both blunted dueling sabres and, beginning in the early 20th century, modern sporting sabres). History During the classical period, fencing was used both for sport and preparation for the duel. Fencing as a sport was one of the original events in the Olympic Games and widely practiced at schools and domestic competitions. Additionally, there were professional fencers competing for prize money. Fencing tournaments were extremely popular events, with spectators flocking to see the most celebrated swordsmen battle it out on the piste. In many cases, fencers of the period trained for sport fencing the same way they trained for duels‚Äîindeed, many fought highly celebrated duels. Dueling went into sharp decline after World War I, following the wartime deaths of many members of the classes that practiced it, and the social changes following the war's mass carnage. After World War II, dueling went out of use in Europe except for rare exceptions. Training for a duel, once almost mandatory for males of aristocratic backgrounds, all but disappeared, along with the classes themselves. Fencing continued as a sport like boxing or karate, with tournaments and championships. However, the need to prepare for a duel with \\"sharps\\" all but vanished. Scoring was done by means of four judges who determined if a hit was made. Two side judges stood behind and to the side of each fencer, and watched for hits made by that fencer on the opponent's target. A director followed the fencing from a point several feet away from the center of the action. At the end of each action, after calling \\"Halt!\\", the director (or, formally, the president of the jury) would describe the action (\\"Attack is from my left. Parry and riposte from my right.\\"), and then poll the judges in turn (\\"Does the attack land?\\"). The judges would answer \\"Yes\\", \\"Yes, but off-target\\", \\"No\\", or \\"Abstain\\". If the judges differed or abstained, the director could overrule them with his vote. This method was universally used, but had limitations. As described in an article in the London newspaper, The Daily Courier, on June 25, 1896: \\"Every one who has watched a bout with the foils knows that the task of judging the hits is with a pair of amateurs difficult enough, and with a well-matched pair of ma√Ætres d‚Äôescrime well-nigh impossible.\\" There also were problems with bias: well- known fencers were often given the benefit of mistakes (so-called \\"reputation touches\\"), and in some cases there was outright cheating. Aldo Nadi complained about this in his autobiography The Living Sword in regard to his famous match with Lucien Gaudin. The article in the Daily Courier described a new invention, the electrical scoring machine, that would revolutionize fencing. Starting with √©p√©e in the 1930s (foil was electrified in 1950s, sabre in 1980s), side judges were replaced by an electrical scoring apparatus, with an audible tone and a red or green light indicating when a touch landed. The scoring box reduced the bias in judging, and permitted more accurate scoring of faster actions, lighter touches, and more touches to the back and flank than were possible with human judges. The advent of the electrical scoring apparatus had far-reaching consequences. The electrical scoring apparatus and the 20th century's overall modernization of athletic activities occurred alongside an increase in the emphasis on fencing as a sport. The electrical scoring apparatus encouraged an emphasis on the athletic and offensive (rather than defensive) aspects of fencing by altering the ways in which a touch would be considered valid. The result was an eventual schism between sport and classical fencing, both stylistically and philosophically. At the time electronic scoring was introduced, all fencers were classically trained, but there were differences in accepting 20th-century changes in fencing practice. The fencing masters who rejected these changes either preserved their tradition, abandoned it in favor of employment as fencing masters in sport fencing, or, as time passed, simply retired. However, enough classically oriented fencers remained to keep traditional, classical fencing alive. Many people self-identify as classical fencers, but do not share the concept of classical fencing described in this article, preferring the early to mid-20th- century style of competitive fencing (which, in the United States, was formalized and governed by the American Fencing League, or AFL) to the more classical style of the 19th century. This should not be confused with the Amateur Fencers League of America (AFLA), which was renamed to the current United States Fencing Association (USFA) in 1981, which is affiliated with the FIE. Revival In the United States (and elsewhere), renewed interest in Western martial arts (beginning in the 1990s) has led some groups‚Äîoften peer- led‚Äîto attempt to study classical fencing (e.g. from books or instructional videos) without the guidance of a classically trained instructor, creating further variation in the classical fencing community. These groups, in an effort to become more historically authentic, sometimes shift their focus to older, pre-19th-century weapons and techniques‚Äîi.e. historical fencing. Today, classical fencing clubs (and classical fencing instructors and masters) can be found in Europe, the United States, Canada, and Australia. Because there is no agreement as to the exact rules of classical fencing and because competition is de-emphasized, what competitions exist are generally local or regional in nature, with the rules depending upon where the tournament is held. However, there are a number of generalizations that unify contemporary classical fencing. First of these is the expression that \\"classical fencing is a frank encounter between two opponents\\" where the object is to touch the other fencer without being touched. Even though the \\"weapons\\" are blunt, the fencers treat them as though they were in fact sharp. Classical fencing still uses the same weapons that have been used in fencing since the early 19th century‚Äînamely, the standard (non-electric) foil, standard √©p√©e (equipped with a pointe d'arret), and sabre (including both blunted dueling sabres and modern standard sporting sabres). Olympic and classical fencing differ in the use of weapon grips for foil and √©p√©e. In sport fencing, the most used handle for foil and √©p√©e is the pistol grip, with the French retaining significant use in √©p√©e. Classical fencing prohibits the pistol grip, and uses the Italian and French grips primarily, and occasionally the Spanish grip. Safety equipment for classical fencing is essentially the same as used in Olympic fencing. It includes: *A fencing mask, typically made of a wire mesh; *A white fencing jacket, which may be canvas duck, stretch nylon, or some other puncture- resistant material; and *A fencing glove, which protects the hand and overlaps the sleeve of the jacket. Fencers also usually wear breeches of material similar to the jacket, with knee-high white socks, or long pants and athletic shoes. There should be no exposed flesh. In addition, female fencers wear rigid breast protection in the form of cups or a chestplate (as do some male fencers, albeit a flat chestplate in that case). Male fencers often wear an athletic cup. Fencers of both genders wear an underarm protector called a plastron worn on the side of the fencer facing the opponent. This provides additional protection in the event of a broken blade penetrating the fencing jacket.  References  * Richard Cohen, By The Sword, 1st ed.

He is best known for his appearances with the American Wrestling Association and World Class Championship Wrestling in the 1980s as Nord the Barbarian and Yukon John and with the World Wrestling Federation, All Japan Pro Wrestling and World Championship Wrestling in the 1990s as The Berzerker and under his birth name.  Professional wrestling career  = Early career = Nord was trained to wrestle by Eddie Sharkey. He debuted in late 1984 under the ring name \\"The Barbarian\\" for Mid-South Wrestling, where he was managed by Skandor Akbar. = American Wrestling Association = In 1985, the AWA originally promoted him as a member of the New Jersey Generals of the United States Football League. In 1986, he became Nord the Barbarian and wrestled in singles and tag team matches (under manager Sheik Adnan El- Kaissey) in the American Wrestling Association. Here, he frequently teamed with Bruiser Brody. The two faced Greg Gagne and Jimmy Snuka as part of a triple main event at WrestleRock 86. = World Class Championship Wrestling = Nord then went to World Class Championship Wrestling in 1987. As Nord The Barbarian he was (managed by Gary Hart), where he feuded with Kevin Von Erich over the WCWA World Heavyweight Championship. He challenged Von Erich for the title at the fourth annual David Von Erich Memorial Parade of Champions at Texas Stadium in 1987. = American Wrestling Association (1989‚Äì1991) = In 1989, he returned to the AWA under the name Yukon John (a lumberjack gimmick where he would come to the ring with an ax, dressed in blue jeans, flannel shirt, animal skin hat and boots). He mainly competed in singles matches, until forming a tag team in 1990 with Scott Norton, called The Yukon Lumberjacks. They briefly feuded with The Texas Hangmen. = Pacific Northwest Wrestling (1991) = After the American Wrestling Association closed in 1991, Nord joined Pacific Northwest Wrestling as \\"Nord the Barbarian\\". He formed a tag team with The Grappler called \\"The Breakfast Club\\". After winning matches, Nord and The Grappler would humiliate their opponents by pouring Cheerios and milk on them. = World Wrestling Federation (1991‚Äì1993) = In 1991, Nord joined the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) as The Viking. He soon became The Berzerker (managed by Mr. Fuji) and feuded with Davey Boy Smith and Jimmy Snuka. His preferred method of winning matches was by throwing his opponents over the top rope for a countout, all the while holding his wrist, licking his hand, shouting \\"Huss! Huss!\\", and falling flat on his back. He was using the gimmick of his deceased former partner King Kong/Bruiser Brody. He wrestled as part of a four-man team in an elimination match at the 1991 Survivor Series pay-per-view event. He was the last man eliminated for his team. He then feuded with The Undertaker, at one point attempting to stab him with his sword. He wrestled in the 1992 Royal Rumble. In July 1992, he won a 40-man Battle Royal on WWF Prime Time Wrestling, and challenged Bret Hart for the WWF Championship that November. Nord's final appearance was as a participant in a battle royal on the February 15, 1993 edition of Monday Night Raw. = All Japan Pro Wrestling and International (1994,1996) = In 1994, Nord traveled to Japan where he competed for All Japan Pro Wrestling under his real name. There he formed a tag team with Stan Hansen. During 1995 he was inactive. In 1996 he wrestled in Malaysia as the Viking. He lost to Rick Martel on March 5 and also lost to Dick Murdoch on March 6. Then he went to South Africa to work for All Star Wrestling. Later that year he wrestled in the independent circuit in Texas. = World Championship Wrestling (1997‚Äì1998) = In 1997, Nord joined World Championship Wrestling (WCW) with bleached blond hair and a fu manchu moustache, under his real name, John Nord. He wrestled mainly on WCW Saturday Night and had a long winning streak that ended with a loss to another streak holder, Bill Goldberg, on July 4, 1998. Nord then formed a short-lived team with Barry Darsow, and was soon gone from WCW.  Personal life  After retiring from wrestling, Nord went to work at his brother's auto dealership, Nord East Motors, in Hilltop, Minnesota. In July 2016, Nord was named part of a class action lawsuit filed against WWE which alleged that wrestlers incurred traumatic brain injuries during their tenure and that the company concealed the risks of injury. The suit is litigated by attorney Konstantine Kyros, who has been involved in a number of other lawsuits against WWE. The lawsuit was dismissed by US District Judge Vanessa Lynne Bryant in September 2018. Nord appeared on the January 24, 2018 episode of Judge Mathis where he was sued by Christine Schmidt, who he had befriended at the substance abuse facility at which she worked, for $4,759 she covered on two credit cards she had opened for him. Nord said he had been in substance abuse recovery since December 2016 and that he and the plaintiff had actually burned through a $10,000 royalty check from WWE on such things as fancy restaurant dinners. Initially, he intended to repay her with funds from another royalty check he expected, but which never materialized. She, therefore, accepted as reimbursement \\"205 valuable wrestling dolls\\" from his days in the business to sell online. Schmidt sold them for a total of $1,700. Nord claimed she would have earned much more if she sold them at their estimated value, including 5 that were allegedly worth approximately $750 each, about which he informed her when offering them as settlement. Schmidt defended the sale by claiming that she was ignorant about selling online and needed money quickly to pay bills. Mathis ruled that she should have done her due diligence before accepting and selling the dolls, and reduced the amount owed to her by the proceeds from the sale to $3,059. On March 23, 2019, Nord was arrested on two charges, a felony for driving while intoxicated/operating a car under the influence of a controlled substance, and a gross misdemeanor for driving after his license was canceled, which he was deemed \\"inimical to public safety.\\" Nord was placed on a $60,000 bond for the felony DWI charge. This was his seventh DUI arrest, and the latest of 16 incidents over the last decade in which Nord has faced either felony or misdemeanor charges. On July 15, 2019, Hennepin County District Judge Jay Quam sentenced Nord to five years' probation on the condition that he remain in restrictive housing and refrain from \\"driving whatsoever.\\" The prosecution had argued for a four-year prison term, arguing that Nord's history shows him to be a significant risk to public safety. The judge, however, in his decision, took into consideration the fact that Nord is in treatment, has been diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis which has confined him to a wheelchair and will spend the remainder of his life in assisted-living facilities.

The majority of the route was along Rosecrans Street; it also included Ca√±on Street and Catalina Boulevard leading to the tip of Point Loma. The Rosecrans Street portion of SR 209 corresponded to the original routing of the historic La Playa Trail. Rosecrans Street was paved in the late 1900s through the community of Roseville, and was added to the state highway system in 1933 as Route 12. SR 209 was designated in the 1964 state highway renumbering, and a full interchange with I-5 and I-8 was completed in 1969. The designation was removed from the state highway system in 2003 and responsibility for the road was transferred to the city of San Diego. Route description Old Point Loma Lighthouse The route began at a turnaround next to the Old Point Loma Lighthouse in the Cabrillo National Monument, near the southern tip of Point Loma. Heading north along the crest of the Point Loma peninsula, it passed through Fort Rosecrans Military Reservation and Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery before exiting the former through a gate and entering the Wooded Area neighborhood of Point Loma as Catalina Boulevard. SR 209 passed through this residential neighborhood and provided access to Point Loma Nazarene University. The SR 209 designation then made a right turn onto Ca√±on Street, curved to the southeast, and went downhill to the bayside location of the old La Playa Trail. At the intersection with Rosecrans Street, the designation made a turn to the northeast at a right angle onto Rosecrans. As it continued northeast through the Roseville and Loma Portal neighborhoods, SR 209 intersected both Harbor Boulevard and Nimitz Boulevard before passing along the northwestern edge of the Naval Training Center San Diego (now closed and redeveloped as Liberty Station) and providing access to the Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego at Barnett Street. SR 209 continued from Midway Drive northeast to the intersection of Sports Arena Boulevard and Camino del Rio West, where the highway continued north onto the latter, terminating at the ramps leading into the interchange with I-5 and I-8. In 1996, SR 209 had an annual average daily traffic (AADT) of 2,600 vehicles at the southern end in Cabrillo National Monument, and 61,000 vehicles at the northern end at the I-5/I-8 junction, the latter of which was the highest AADT for the highway. History United States Boundary Survey of the San Diego area, 1850, showing the La Playa Trail from La Playa to Old San Diego and the Mission The Rosecrans Street portion of the highway followed the route of the historic La Playa Trail, the oldest European trail on the west coast, which connected the Spanish settlements in Old Town and Mission San Diego de Alcala with the ship loading and unloading area at La Playa. In February 1907, a petition to construct a railway line along Rosecrans Street from 38th Street to MacAuley Street was introduced to the San Diego City Council. By July, work was to begin on grading Rosecrans Street through what was known as the city of Roseville in preparation for construction of the Point Loma Electric Railway line. The work was briefly disrupted due to a labor dispute, but by June 1908, of the had been paved. By March 1909, railroad tracks were being placed along Rosecrans Street. The city assumed maintenance of the road on May 1, after it had been paved from Tide Street to Ocean Beach. Private citizens paid for over $100,000 of the costs, and the city was to pay for $12,000, according to an agreement made in 1904. However, by December the bill had not been paid by the city due to a lack of funds, and the construction company filed a claim; on December 29, the city agreed to pay $12,000, using funds from the water department. The termination of the Point Loma streetcar line was considered in 1923, but the San Diego Electric Railway decided to keep it running after residents opposed the idea of using buses instead. However, by 1946, bus lines were in place on Rosecrans Street, and a petition for increased bus service to Point Loma was given to the city in October 1947. The new divided highway known as Rosecrans Boulevard from Lytton Street to Canon Street was dedicated on June 5, 1940, and was a part of the state highway system extending to Cabrillo National Monument, which served as the western end of Legislative Route 12. Before this project, it was a two-lane road that had issues such as traffic congestion and flooding. A monument marking La Playa Trail at Avenida de Portugal and Rosecrans Street that had been installed in 1934 was removed by the construction in the 1940s; however, a replacement was installed in 2010. Another of the six monuments was moved out of the median near the Midway Drive intersection to a commercial area that same year. During the 1950s, the route from Lytton Street and Rosecrans Street to Pacific Highway was considered a part of US 80. SR 209 was designated in the 1964 state highway renumbering. Plans for an interchange between I-5, I-8, SR 209, and SR 109 date from 1965, although several concerns had to be taken into account, including the preservation of historical Old Town and keeping traffic through the area moving during construction. The goal was to begin construction in 1966, and complete the interchange in 1969. There were concerns about a $3 billion shortfall in funding during May 1966, which caused the San Diego Chamber of Commerce Highway Committee to recommend the completion of SR 109 as a project. Construction had begun on September 22, 1966, and the interchange was to replace the intersection of Pacific Highway and Rosecrans Street. The cost of the interchange was projected to be $10.86 million. The eight-lane freeway was projected to relieve traffic in the Frontier Street area coming from the San Diego Sports Arena. Completion of both the interchange and SR 109 was planned for early 1969. The ramp from south I-5 to Camino del Rio opened in February 1968, with the remainder of the project to be completed in summer 1969. The entire project was completed in September, with the road scheduled to open in October; just a few months before, the routing of SR 209 had been determined. The routing of SR 109 was officially added to I-8 in 1972. In 1971, there was a state proposal to remove SR 209 from the state highway system, which the City of San Diego objected to. However, SR 209 was deleted from the system in 2003, and had been given to the City of San Diego in 2001.

He grew up in Pinar del R√≠o and began to work selling ice cream and newspapers when he was eleven years old. He was a soldier, swimming and kayak instructor, agricultural worker, technician in construction, technical designer, radio speaker, and journalist for 26 years. He is a painter and sculptor and an author of several poetry books. He came to central Havana when he was 37 and was astonished by the level of violence but also by the energy of the people who lived there. He is the author of Dirty Havana Trilogy, King of Havana, Tropical Animal (winner of Spain's Alfonso Garcia Ramos Prize in 2000), The Insatiable Spiderman, Dog Meat (winner of Italy's Narrativa Sur del Mundo Prize), Snake's Nest (winner of the Prix des Am√©riques Insulaires et de la Guyane in 2008), Our GG in Havana, and the short stories of Melancholy of Lions. Dirty Havana Trilogy, Tropical Animal and The Insatiable Spiderman have been translated to English. Since 1994, he has written ten prose books and five books of poetry. In 2007, he published Coraz√≥n Mestizo, a Cuban travel book. Writings Called a master of \\"Cuban dirty realism,\\" like Zo√© Vald√©s and Fernando Vel√°zquez Medina, he tells the stories of the Cuban underclass in a direct, visceral style. His books describe contemporary Cuba from his semiautobiographical perspective as a disillusioned journalist. His books are typically gritty, tragicomic accounts of himself and his countrymen hustling for money, searching for pleasure and happiness, and struggling in desperate situations. He makes heavy use of irony. His stories illustrate the difficulty of achieving self-sufficiency and contentment in a dysfunctional and poverty- stricken society with a paternalistic government. His narrative voice is skeptical, intellectual, humorous, crass, sardonic, and bluntly frank. His literary persona is chiefly concerned with escaping poverty. However, efforts are rarely successful, and much of his time is spent escaping misery through sex and his preferred vices of rum, cigars and marijuana. Dirty Havana Trilogy (Trilog√≠a sucia de La Habana) (1998) is his best known work. It is set during the economic depression in Cuba in the early to mid-1990s. Its first two parts, \\"Anclado en la tierra de nadie\\" (\\"Anchored in No-man's Land\\") and \\"Nada que hacer\\" (\\"Nothing to Do\\"), follow the picaresque adventures of a protagonist, who, like the author, is a one-time journalist called Pedro Juan. He struggles with loneliness, claustrophobia and alcoholism. The third part, \\"Sabor a m√≠\\" (\\"Essence of Me\\"), is a collection of short stories in which Pedro Juan appears only intermittently. Despite his grim depiction of Cuban life, his writing stresses his overriding love for Cuban culture. He frequently praises Cuban music, resourcefulness, and joie de vivre. He writes scornfully of people who avoid risk and self-expression in exchange for smothering safety and boredom-inducing banality.

Dailey along with Dr. George Monell and Thomas Gibson on April 23, 1859, when present-day Denver was part of the Kansas Territory and before the city of Denver had been incorporated. It became Colorado's oldest newspaper and possibly its longest continuously operated business. Its first issue was printed on a printing press from Omaha, Nebraska, that had been hauled by oxcart during the start of the Colorado Gold Rush. Elizabeth \\"Libby\\" Byers accompanied the press from Nebraska to Denver and joined her husband as a copublisher and journalist at the paper. That first issue was printed only 20 minutes ahead of its rival, the Cherry Creek Pioneer. The Rocky went from a weekly to a daily newspaper in August 1860, and from an evening to a morning newspaper in July 1870. =Crime fighter= In 1883, the newspaper took a stand against corruption and crime in Denver. One of its primary targets was city crime boss Jefferson Randolph Smith, alias \\"Soapy\\" Smith. In one crime- fighting campaign, the managing editor, John Arkins, allowed disrespectful comments about Smith's wife and children to be published and Smith assaulted Arkins with a cane, severely injuring the editor. The News continued its crusade to rid Denver of its most celebrated bad man, which took nearly a decade to complete. =Jack Foster= The E. W. Scripps Company bought the Rocky Mountain News in 1926. The Rocky Mountain News and its competitors, including The Denver Post, resorted to gasoline giveaways and other promotions in an attempt to boost circulation. By the early 1940s, the Rocky had nearly died. It was saved by then editor Jack Foster when he convinced Scripps to approve changing the newspaper from a broadsheet format to a tabloid design. Foster reasoned that the new format would make it easier for readers to hold and navigate and would make advertising more affordable. Foster's wife, Frances, introduced America's first \\"advice\\" column, called Molly Mayfield. It became an instant favorite among readers and was soon adopted in many other newspapers, paving the way for advice columnists such as Ann Landers and Abigail Van Buren. =Joint operating agreement= After a continued rivalry that almost put both papers out of business, the Rocky and The Post merged operations in 2001 under a joint operating agreement. Through the agreement, the Denver Newspaper Agency was formed. The new company ran all noneditorial operations of both papers, namely advertising and circulation, and was equally owned by the E. W. Scripps Company and by MediaNews Group, which owns The Post. The two newspapers continued to publish separately except during the weekends, when the Rocky Mountain News was published only on Saturday and The Denver Post only on Sunday; each newspaper had one page of editorials in the other paper's weekend edition. They maintained their rivalry. The Rocky was considered more politically conservative than the Post. The May 2, 2006, front page of the Rocky Mountain News, before the 2007 redesign =Redesign= On January 23, 2007, the Rocky Mountain News was redesigned to a smaller, magazine-style format with more color pages and photographs, full-page photo section covers, a new masthead logo, and different page numbering from the previous design. The redesign was the result of new presses that allowed the newspaper to print about 25% faster than its old presses, at an average speed of 60,000 issues per hour. =Closure= On December 4, 2008, E. W. Scripps put the News up for sale, with industry analysts saying the move was possibly a prelude to shutting down the paper. Although Scripps was contacted by Brian Ferguson, a private equity investor from Texas, who expressed interest, that deal fell through for reasons that included complications of the joint operating agreement. On February 26, 2009, Scripps announced that the Rocky Mountain News would print its final edition the next day, and that the newspaper's masthead, archives, and web site would be offered for sale, separate from its interest in the newspaper agency. Following the shutdown of the Rocky, the Post, now the only daily newspaper in Denver, resumed seven- day-a-week publication. A few years later, a study by a Portland State University professor attributed a decline of 30% in civic engagement following the closure of the Rocky. Revival plans and successors =INDenver Times and the Rocky Mountain Independent= On March 16, 2009, several former Rocky Mountain News staffers announced a plan to develop a new on-line, real-time local newspaper, with a staff of about 30 journalists. The plan required 50,000 subscriber pledges before April 23, 2009; if that goal was met, the full website, with the name INDenver Times, would launch on May 4, 2009. On April 23, 2009, INDenver Times, the name for the proposed restart, reported that only 3,000 people had subscribed to the premium content subscription model. The three co-founders said that they did not intend to continue the planned business model, and, instead, would create a less-staffed news site, while Steve Foster and several former Rocky Mountain News journalists said that they believed that the original business model of a robustly staffed on- line alternative newspaper could succeed and were looking for new backers. INDenver Times, still on-line , does not use the subscription model, instead depending on advertising for its revenue. , the three co-founders Kevin Prebuld, Brad Gray, and Ben Ray, editor Steve Haigh, and contributors Drew Litton and Ed Stein were the only remaining staff from the original venture. The site relies on 15 contributors and six \\"INSighters\\". On September 7, 2009, INDT.com unveiled a new website design, allowing readers to read the news in a more organized format. On July 4, 2009, Steve Foster and several former Rocky Mountain News employees launched a new venture known as the Rocky Mountain Independent. The new website used a three-pronged revenue strategy: advertising, subscription revenues, and outside contributors. Subscriptions cost $4.00 per month and yearly subscriptions were 50% for the first three months, at $24. The 12 owners of the website committed to working for free until the end of September 2009. The website stopped publishing new content on October 5, 2009. =Possible revival= In December 2014 Denver billionaire Philip Anschutz was reported to be exploring the possibility of reviving the Rocky Mountain News; he had placed a prototype online and was conducting market research to assess the feasibility of a relaunch. Awards In 2000, the Rocky Mountain News photo staff was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Photography \\"for its powerful collection of emotional images taken after the student shootings at Columbine High School.\\" In 2002, the paper won more first-place awards than any other Western newspaper. In 2003, the Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Photography was awarded to the Rocky Mountain News photography staff \\"for its powerful, imaginative coverage of Colorado's raging forest fires.\\" The paper also won the Colorado Press Association's General Excellence Award, the award for the best large daily newspaper in Colorado (for the eighth year in a row). The photo and design staffs won 25 Society for News Design awards, placed eighth in the world, and won nine National Press Photographers Association awards and six Pictures of the Year International awards. In 2006, Jim Sheeler of the Rocky Mountain News won the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing for his \\"Final Salute\\" special report, the story of a Marine major assigned to casualty notification and how he helps families with fallen relatives in Iraq cope with their losses. Todd Heisler won the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography the same year for his photos in the same special report.

It is Fowles' sixth major novel, following The Collector, The Magus, The French Lieutenant's Woman, Daniel Martin, and Mantissa. Its title, as the author explains in the prologue, is taken from the archaic sense of the word that means \\"whim\\", \\"quirk\\", \\"obsession\\", or even a snatch of music (see earworm). Another meaning of the word \\"maggot\\" becomes apparent later in the novel, used by a character to describe a white, oblong machine that appears to be a spacecraft. Though the author denied that A Maggot is a historical novel, it does take place during a precise historical timeframe, May 1736 to February 1737, in England. It might be variously classified as historical fiction, mystery, or science fiction. Because of the narrative style and various metafictional devices, most critics classify it as a postmodern novel. Plot summary The book opens with an objective narration about a group of five travellers travelling through Exmoor in rural England. They arrive at an inn in a small village, and soon it becomes clear that they are not who they seem to be. The \\"maid\\" Louise casually rebuffs the sexual advances of the servant, Dick Thurlow, but then goes to his master's room and undresses before them both. Bartholomew calls his supposed uncle \\"Lacy\\" and they discuss Bartholomew's refusal to disclose his journey's secret purpose, as well as fate versus free will. Eventually the narration stops and is followed by letters, interview transcripts, and snatches of more third-person narration, interspersed by facsimile pages from contemporary issues of The Gentleman's Magazine. We learn from a fictional news story that a man has been found hanged near the place where the travellers were staying. The subsequent interviews are conducted by Henry Ayscough, a lawyer employed by Bartholomew's father, who is a Duke. The interviews reveal that Bartholomew had hired the party to travel with him but deceived them about the purpose of his journey. Variations of his story are (1) he was on his way to elope against the wishes of family; (2) he was visiting a wealthy, aged aunt to secure an inheritance from her; (3) he was seeking a cure for impotence; (4) he was pursuing some scientific or occult knowledge, possibly concerning knowledge of the future. He takes Rebecca and Dick to a cave in a remote area. Rebecca's initial tale, retold by Jones, is that he there performed a satanic ritual, and Rebecca herself was raped by Satan and forced to view a panorama of human suffering and cruelty. Rebecca's own testimony admits this was a deception to quiet Jones. She says that she actually saw Bartholomew meet a noble lady who took them all inside a strange floating craft (which she calls \\"the maggot\\"). In this craft she sees what she describes as a divine revelation of heaven (\\"June Eternal\\") and the Shaker Trinity (Father, Son, and female Holy Spirit or \\"Mother Wisdom\\"). She also sees a vision of human suffering and cruelty in this version of her story. Modern readers may interpret her visions as films and her overall experience as a contact with time travellers or extraterrestrials. Rebecca then loses consciousness; she wakes, finds Jones outside the cave, and they leave together. She then tells Jones the satanic version of her experience. Meanwhile, Jones has seen Dick leave the cave in terror, presumably to go and hang himself. Rebecca later finds herself pregnant. She returns to her Quaker parents but then converts to Shakerism, marries a blacksmith named John Lee, and gives birth to Ann Lee, the future leader of the American Shakers. The mystery of Bartholomew's disappearance is never solved, and Ayscough surmises that he committed suicide out of guilt from his disobedience to his father in the matter of an arranged marriage.  Main characters  *\\"Mr. Bartholomew\\" (real name unknown; son of the Duke): Bartholomew is the instigator of the action (the journey from London to Dolling's Cave) and primary actor in the mysterious event at the core of the plot; his disappearance drives an investigation, the documentation of which makes up the majority of the novel. *Rebecca Lee (n√©e Hocknell; aliases Fanny, Louise): A former Quaker forced by circumstances into prostitution. Hired by Bartholomew to accompany him on his journey, she is the only living witness of the mysterious event in the cave, and the fictional mother of the real Shaker leader Ann Lee. *Dick Thurlow: Bartholomew's childhood companion and servant, he is deaf and mute. His apparent suicide following the event in the cave complicates the mystery of Bartholomew's disappearance. *Francis Lacy (alias Mr. Brown): An actor hired by Bartholomew to play his uncle during the journey. His testimony adds little to the mystery of the disappearance, though it includes several important conversations with Bartholomew about the nature of God, fate, free will, and social justice. *David Jones (alias Sergeant Farthing): An actor/loafer and acquaintance of Lacy, hired by Bartholomew to play a soldier who protects the travellers. Provides important testimony from the outside of the cave as well as his retelling of the \\"demonic\\" version of Rebecca's story. *Henry Ayscough: A lawyer hired by the Duke to investigate Bartholomew's disappearance. His letters to the Duke which report his progress, as well as the transcripts of his interrogations of various witnesses, make up the majority of the novel. *The Duke (father of \\"Bartholomew\\"): Though he appears in the story only once (briefly), he initiates the investigation, and Ayscough's letters and transcripts are all sent to him. Some critics argue that readers are implicitly identified with the Duke, leading them to examine their assumptions and interpretations critically. It is widely assumed he is gay. Technique and themes The novel's narrative technique of using letters, interviews, a fictional news story (see false document), and real historical documents harks back to, and to some extent satirises, the conventions in place early in the history of the novel, when the epistolary novel was the most common form. (Fowles' book is set in 1736, just a few decades after the first novels in English, and just a few years before Samuel Richardson's landmark Pamela.) Originally, these strategies were intended to strengthen the illusion of reality and mitigate the fictionality of fiction; Fowles uses them ironically to highlight the disconnect between fiction and reality. At several points in the novel, the characters or narrator foreground their existence as characters in a story, further highlighting the book's fictionality. Moreover, the novel resists many conventions of fiction, such as the omniscient narrator (Fowles' narrator seems omniscient but divulges little of importance) and the drive for climax and resolution. In particular, the novel resists the convention of detective fiction which satisfies the desire for a final solution. The novel also examines the nature of history, historiography, and criminal justice, as Ayscough represents the historian/judge trying to create a coherent narrative out of problematic testimonies. The \\"maggot\\" itself, as a possible time machine, represents historians as intruders in the past who alter it according to their own desires and needs. The power struggle between Ayscough and Rebecca to create the narrative of the past problematises the objectivity of history, making it subordinate to interests of social class and gender. In the end, Fowles uses Rebecca and Ayscough as representatives of two classes of people, one subjective, intuitive, mystical, artistic (i.e., \\"right-brained\\"); the other objective, analytical, and judgmental (i.e., \\"left-brained\\"). See cerebral hemisphere. Finally, Fowles explicitly positions A Maggot in an era which, he claims, saw the beginning of modern selfhood (see self (psychology), self (philosophy), individual). Rebecca is a prototypical modern individual experiencing the difficulty of breaking free from the restraints of society and convention to be radically self-realized. In this we can see Fowles' residual existentialism, though the novel as a whole represents a move beyond existentialism. His postscript both praises the struggle for modern selfhood and criticises it for having been co-opted by capitalism to create excessive consumerism. Selected criticism *Brax, Klaus.

He first appeared in The Eternals #13 (July 1977) and was created by Jack Kirby. He is a member of the near-immortal hidden race known as the Eternals. He was also a member of the Avengers. Don Lee portrays Gilgamesh in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, debuting in Eternals (2021). Publication history The Forgotten One was created by Jack Kirby, and first appeared in The Eternals #13 (July 1977). Fictional character biography During his millennia of activity, the adventurer and warrior Forgotten One has used the names of or been mistaken for numerous heroes of myth and legend, including Gilgamesh and Hercules. He became an outcast from his fellow Eternals when their ruler, Zuras, decreed that he had been too proud a meddler in the mortal world and confined him to a sector of Olympus. Eventually the Eternal known as Sprite convinced him to come out of exile and journey to the mother-ship of the Fourth Host of the Celestials to assist the Eternals in battle against the Deviants.Eternals (vol. 1) #13 After this battle, he was renamed Hero by the One Above All, the chief of the alien Celestials, who had created the Eternals and Deviants. After losing a battle with Thor, Hero and the other Eternals assisted Thor in battling the host of the Celestials to prevent them from destroying humanity. Hero also fought Hercules.Thor #287-289 Hero later became known as the Forgotten One. He helped the other Eternals in battle against Ghaur.Eternals (vol. 2) #6, 9, 12 Later, when the membership of the Avengers had been virtually emptied, the Forgotten One joined them for a time. He renamed himself Gilgamesh, donning a costume that resembled the hide of the Bull of Heaven and went to work as a monster-slayer. He assisted the Avengers in battles against the Growing Man, Nanny, the Orphan-Maker and N'astirh's demons.Avengers #300 He participated in the Avengers' battle against SupernovaAvengers #301-303 and helped them fight the U-Foes.Avengers #304 He assisted the Avengers in their struggle with the Lava Men, and was somehow severely injured during the battle.Avengers #306-308 Gilgamesh was brought to the Eternals' home of Olympia, which had temporarily fallen into the Negative Zone, to recover from his injuries. There, he fought against Blastaar, who had temporarily disintegrated the other Eternals. Gilgamesh left the Avengers at that time, as his essence had been bound to Olympus.Avengers #309-310 He later recovered from his injuries and defeated B'Gon the sorcerer, thereby winning a reputation as a hero on modern day Earth.Avengers Spotlight #25 Gilgamesh was later seen among the superhumans selected by Her as potential mates.Quasar #29 He returned to the Avengers Mansion during \\"The Crossing\\", a crossover, only to be killed by Neut, an agent of the time traveler Immortus, who was at the time disguised as Kang the Conqueror. It was later shown that Gilgamesh is alive, and once again associated with his fellow Eternals.Eternals (vol. 4) #3 (October 2008) Later, he team up with Hercules and after that, travelled to Deviant Lemuria, where he helped the God Thor (Marvel Comics), who was fighting the deviants leaded by Ghaur.Thor, the Deviants saga #3-5 (2012) Powers and abilities The Forgotten One is a member of the Eternal race, and possesses a number of superhuman abilities common to the Eternals, but has trained some of them far beyond the norm. While the exact limits are unknown, his immense, superhuman strength makes him the physically strongest of all known Eternals, save for Thanos. His strength has been shown to rival that of Thor, and Hercules. Like all other Eternals, The Forgotten One is virtually immortal. He hasn't aged since reaching adulthood and he is immune to all known diseases; his body is also highly durable and resistant to physical injury. He is capable of withstanding high caliber bullets, falls from great heights, powerful concussive forces, and temperature extremes, all without being injured. However, it is possible to injure him by disrupting the mental discipline that he maintains over his body. This ability allows him to control every molecule in his body, which in turn allows him to regenerate any damaged or destroyed tissue. However, should his mental discipline be broken, it is possible to permanently injure or kill him. Other abilities that he has in common with most other Eternals include the power to levitate himself and/or fly at great speed, project beams of concussive force or heat from his eyes and hands, and the power to manipulate matter. To what degree these powers have been developed in comparison with other Eternals isn't known, but the first two have been stated as presumed to be average. He also has highly developed senses that helped to compensate for his former blindness, enabling him to be an excellent hunter and tracker. The Forgotten One is one of the most accomplished hand-to-hand combatants among the Eternals. He possesses an extraordinary melee capacity, with knowledge of most methods of hand-to-hand combat known in ancient Earth civilizations. He sometimes wears battle armor of unknown composition, and usually arms himself with simple hand weapons such as an axe, spear, or club. Other characters Other characters have used the identity of either Gilgamesh or Hero. These include: *The Eternal Warrior was called Gilgamesh in Marvel Preview #12. *Jimmy Rogers created Hero to save him from monsters in Venus #17. Reception Newsarama ranked the character, as Gilgamesh, as the second worst Avengers member commenting: \\"What's that you say? You aren't familiar with Gilgamesh, the ancient Sumerian hero? And why is this guy wearing a cow on his head? Let's just say there's a reason this guy is called \\"The Forgotten One\\". Maybe next time you can get Mithras, or at least Marduk\\".

A lawyer before entering foreign politics, most notable was his effort to bring Swedish colonists to northern Maine and later founding the community of New Sweden, Maine in 1870. He is also noted for being the last U.S. ambassador to the united kingdoms of Sweden and Norway.William Widgery Thomas Jr. (Thomas Memorial Library) Consular years A Republican, Thomas found a love for the people of Scandinavia at an early age. At only 23 years of age, and full of enthusiasm for his task, he was appointed consul to Gothenburg, Sweden on October 23, 1862. Prior to that he had gone as American consul to Galatz in Romania, and after a voyage of four months, he reached Gothenburg in the middle of June 1863. He learned quickly to understand and speak Swedish, and as consul, in the kingdom of Sweden-Norway he laid plans for a large emigration of both Swedes and Norwegians, with the hopes that most would seek new fortunes in his home state of Maine. As he wrote April 5, 1864, for the encouragement of immigration: \\"Besides all other reasons, I believe these honest, pious, plodding Swedes would form an excellent balance to the fickle, merry, light-hearted Irish, who are now crowding in such goodly numbers to our shores.\\" After the Second war of Schleswig between Denmark and Prussia ended in 1864, Swedish volunteers coming back from Denmark wanted to go to America and continue fighting there in the American Civil War. Thomas solved this problem without asking his government for directions. He arranged with the captains of the Hamburg steamers to take these soldiers across the ocean at half price, and together with some friends he \\"made up a little purse\\" with which they could be sent to Hamburg. \\"I am well aware,\\" he reported to the U.S. Department of State, \\"that as consul I can have nothing to do with enlisting soldiers, but no international law can prevent me from paying a soldier's passage from here to Hamburg out of my own pocket.\\" In the course of the following winter, Thomas induced more Swedish soldiers to go to America. The same year he had planned to enlarge his propaganda for emigration considerably. He wrote to the Department: \\"I have the honor to ask for a leave of absence from this Consular district, but not from this Kingdom, for three months; my absence to commence about the middle of May next. My design is to visit the mines in the interior of Sweden and Norway and to see and talk with the people of this country in their own homes. One of the chief objects of my expedition will be to encourage all whom I meet to emigrate to the United States. In every hamlet where I pass the night, at every post-station where I await fresh horses, I shall scatter such information as I have found by experience to be best calculated to promote the emigration of these Scandinavians to our own land. It is my intention on my return to report the results of my expedition to the Department, giving special attention to the subject of immigration, stating what impediments still exist, and the best means of overcoming them. Hon. J. S. Haldeman, Minister Resident at Stockholm, has authorized me to mention that he warmly approves of my intended journey.\\" The Department, too, approved. It granted, on March 26, the leave of absence Thomas had applied for. But when this permission arrived, he was so busy arranging his other plans that he decided to postpone his trip until the next year. Towards the end of June 1865, he set out on the journey he had planned, taking with him the text of the Homestead Act and other documents printed in the language of the country, proposing to sow this good seed broadcast all along his way. In fact, the journey came to embrace Norway almost exclusively. Returning to Gothenburg after several months, he sent his report to the Department of State, an excerpt of it reads: > One of the chief objects of my expedition was to diffuse knowledge tending > towards emigration, and whether driving over the fjelds, scaling mountains, > resting at stations, or coasting along the shore in steamers, I everywhere > preached an immigration crusade to the laborer's paradise in the New World. > I spoke of our homestead law ‚Äî the fertility of our soil ‚Äî the length of our > summer ‚Äî the richness of our immense mining districts, but I found nothing > so telling as the simple description of the condition and prospects of the > working man in the United States of America. Of fifty odd postillions I had > along the road, all promised me to immigrate to the United States next > Spring, save one; he, I ascertained, had been in England for nine months, > and, judging all foreign countries by the one he had visited, concluded, > perhaps wisely according to his light, to remain at home. ( ... ) Sometimes > some Norwegian proprietors, not liking perhaps the tendency of things, would > commence a discussion in presence of the deck-passengers. I found it very > easy to refute all their arguments. When driven from every other point they > invariably took refuge under the palladium of patriotism ‚Äî love for Gamle > Norge (Old Norway). To this I replied, that I recognized no love of country, > not connected with love for our countrymen; if then, as they had been > constrained to admit, the Norwegian laborer bettered his condition by > immigrating into the United States, true patriotism should assist him to go, > not hinder him from going. I however always treated these Norwegian > gentlemen personally with the greatest respect. In no case did one > discussion descend to altercation, and no unfriendly words were ever used. Thomas estimated a total of 10,000 immigrants that year to the United States from Sweden and Norway, but he was quick to add the numbers would prove rather under than over the truth. Shortly after this propaganda trip through Norway, the consular activities of Thomas came to an end. At the beginning of November 1865, he received notice from the Department of State that, under the act of Congress, it was not authorized to continue his salary anymore. Consequently, he resigned and left for his home state of Maine. Maine politics In Maine, he became, in 1870, a member of the immigration commission, virtually its leading member, and in that year he went to Sweden, brought a whole colony of Swedes back to America, and founded New Sweden in the northern forests of Maine, where he himself spent the better part of the next four years. He was a member of the Maine House of Representatives 1873‚Äì1875 and served as Speaker of the Maine House of Representatives from 1874 to 1875. Also a member of the Maine State Senate in 1879 and delegate to Republican National Convention from Maine in 1880. Ambassador years The American ambassador William W. Thomas Jr (bearded man) visiting the Curman family in Lysekil. Thomas would return to Scandinavia, serving as American Minister to Sweden and Norway in three separate terms: 1883-1885, 1889-1894 and 1898-1905. Sweden in particular would always remain his great love; he married a Swedish noblegirl, Dagmar T√∂rnebladh (1869-1912), on October 11, 1887 in Stockholm. Thomas was appointed American Minister for his third and last period on December 18, 1898, until he was recalled on May 31, 1905. In a letter to the U.S. Department of State February 2, 1905, Thomas wrote: \\"A serious crisis for the union of Sweden and Norway seems very imminent.\\" He was commenting on the growing concerns that the Norwegian government was about to renounce the union with Sweden. He added in the letter that he was convinced there wouldn't be a war between the two countries, and personally he hoped the union could be preserved. He continued, \\"in this conviction of peace, lies the greatest hope for every friend of Scandinavia, that the union between these two noble nations in the high north, must be preserved in one form or another.\\" In March 1905 he reported home that the Norwegian government had resigned and a new one would be formed. He noted the new one would probably be composed of \\"members of the extreme left, meaning those who wish for an immediate and radical action in regard to the relationship between Sweden and Norway.\\" This \\"extreme left\\" was now prime minister Christian Michelsen, who to all Norwegians would become the leading symbol of the movement towards dissolution of the unpopular union. Thomas' last mission as American Minister ended that spring, he was recalled on May 31, making him in effect, the last US ambassador to the united kingdoms of Sweden and Norway. On June 7, 1905, the union of Sweden and Norway ended, and he would be succeeded by Charles H. Graves.Bio of William Widgery Thomas Jr. (Representative Men of Maine, a Collection of Biographical Sketches. Portland, Maine: Lakeside Press, 1893) Thomas moved back home to Maine. He married a second time on June 2, 1915, in Solna, Sweden, his first wife¬¥s younger sister, Aina T√∂rnebladh (1877-1967). On June 2, 1919, William Widgery Thomas Jr. donated the Thomas Memorial Library to the Inhabitants of the Town of Cape Elizabeth to be maintained as a free public library forever. Ambassador Thomas died on April 25, 1927 at the age of 88 and was buried at Evergreen Cemetery, Portland, Maine. His wives were the daughters of Dr Henrik Ragnar T√∂rnebladh (1833-1912), a headmaster and member of the Swedish Parliament 1873-1875, 1879-1888 and 1889-1909, and his wife Elisabeth Maria Siljestr√∂m (1842-1929). William Widgery Thomas was honoured with the Royal Swedish Order of the Polar Star, Knight Commander 1st class, in 1887, and Grand Cross in 1905.

Background It followed up Executive Order 10479, signed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower on August 13, 1953, which established the anti-discrimination Committee on Government Contracts, which was itself based on a similar Executive Order 8802, issued by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1941. Eisenhower's executive order has been amended and updated by at least six executive orders.National Archives: \\"Executive Orders Disposition Tables, Dwight D. Eisenhower - 1953\\", accessed February 4, 2012 It differed significantly from the requirements of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which required organizations only to document their practices once there was a preliminary finding of wrongdoing. The executive order required the businesses that were covered to maintain and furnish documentation of hiring and employment practices upon request.Faye J. Crosby and Cheryl VanDeVeer, eds., Sex, Race, & Merit: Debating Affirmative Action in Education and Employment (University of Michigan, 2000), 220, available online, accessed February 4, 2012 The executive order also required contractors with 51 or more employees and contracts of $50,000 or more to implement affirmative action plans to increase the participation of minorities and women in the workplace if a workforce analysis demonstrates their under-representation, meaning that there are fewer minorities and women than would be expected given the numbers of minorities and women qualified to hold the positions available. Federal regulations require affirmative action plans to include an equal opportunity policy statement, an analysis of the current work force, identification of under-represented areas, the establishment of reasonable, flexible goals and timetables for increasing employment opportunities, specific action-oriented programs to address problem areas, support for community action programs, and the establishment of an internal audit and reporting system. It assigned the responsibility for enforcing parts of the non-discrimination in contracts with private industry to the Department of Labor. Detailed regulations for compliance with the Order were not issued until 1969, when the Nixon administration made affirmative action part of its civil rights strategy.Faye Crosby, Margaret S. Stockdale, and S. Ann Ropp, eds., Sex Discrimination in the Workplace: Multidisciplinary Perspectives (Blackwell Publishing, 2007), 303.

In April 1971, the court rejected numerous challenges to the order, including claims that it was beyond the president's constitutional authority, was inconsistent with Titles VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and was inconsistent with the National Labor Relations Act.Contractors Association of Eastern Pennsylvania v.

In 1986, the Reagan administration was opposed to the affirmative action requirements of the executive order and contemplated modifying it to prohibit employers from using \\"quotas, goals, or other numerical objectives, or any scheme[,] device, or technique that discriminates against, or grants any preference to, any person on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\\" The contemplated change was never issued because it faced bipartisan opposition in Congress that threatened to counteract it by enacting Executive Order 11246 into law by a veto-proof majority.Nicholas Laham, The Reagan Presidency and the Politics of Race: In Pursuit of Colorblind Justice and Limited Government (Praeger, 1998), 87ff., available online, accessed February 5, 2012 Amendments On October 13, 1967 Executive Order 11375 amended Executive Order 11246 adding the category \\"sex\\" to the anti-discrimination provisions.

It exempted newspapers from certain provisions of antitrust laws. Its drafters argued that this would allow the survival of multiple daily newspapers in a given urban market where circulation was declining. This exemption stemmed from the observation that the alternative is usually for at least one of the newspapers, generally the one published in the evening, to cease operations altogether. In practice two daily newspapers published in the same city or geographic area combine business operations while maintaining separate‚Äîand competitive‚Äînews operations. History The first joint operating agreement was between Albuquerque Tribune (then the New Mexico State Tribune) and the Albuquerque Journal in Albuquerque, New Mexico, signed on February 20, 1933. Their agreement became typical of the type‚Äîboth papers were printed on the same presses at different times of day. Classified advertising sales were consolidated, as were distribution agents. A joint entity to perform these functions was created, with equal representation on its board from both papers. Newsgathering and editorial operations remained completely separate, although located under one roof in different portions of the same building. Arrangements similar to this allowed most medium-sized United States cities to have two daily newspapers until fairly recently. The number of joint operating agreements, as well as the number of evening-published daily newspapers, has declined considerably in recent years, due to the ongoing consolidation of the newspaper industry as a whole, and the decline in readership and interest in evening newspapers in particular, which many observers have attributed to television and the internet, of which the former seems to be magnified by the presence of several 24-hour-a-day news operations on cable television. There have been 28 Joint Operating Agreements to date. The Chattanooga Times and the Chattanooga News-Free Presss joint operating agreement became the first to be terminated on August 27, 1966. The Newspaper Preservation Act was touted as a relief measure to allow multiple newspapers competing in the same market to cut costs, thus ensuring that no one paper could have supremacy in the market by driving the other(s) out of business. However, mounting evidence suggests the passage of the Act was less about protecting editorial diversity within community newspaper markets than about inflating the profit margins of national newspaper chains. By quietly and informally taking on some behaviors of a cartel, large newspaper chains were able to sustain artificially high profits while driving independent newspapers out of business (or forcing them to sell their stake to a chain). Note that many of the papers listed in the sections below have the same few ownership groups. In fact, President Richard M. Nixon initially opposed the passage of the act (as had his predecessor, Lyndon B. Johnson) as being antithetical to the essential practices and character of free market capitalism. He reversed himself upon receiving a letter from Richard E. Berlin, CEO of the Hearst chain of newspapers and magazines. In the 1969 letter, Berlin intimated that failure of the law to pass would carry political consequences and hinted that support from Nixon would conversely help the President and his allies. The Nixon Administration supported the Act's passage, and in the 1972 Presidential Campaign, every Hearst newspaper endorsed Nixon for reelection.

Citro during a public radio broadcast in 1992 to denote an area of southwestern Vermont within which a number of people went missing between 1945 and 1950. This was further popularized in two books, including Shadow Child, in which he devoted chapters to discussion of these disappearances and various items of folklore surrounding the area. According to Citro, the area shares characteristics with the Bridgewater Triangle in neighboring Massachusetts. Precisely what area is encompassed in this hypothetical \\"mystery triangle\\" is not clear, but it is purportedly centered on Glastenbury Mountain and would include some or most of the area of the towns immediately surrounding it, especially Bennington, Woodford, Shaftsbury, and Somerset. Glastenbury and its neighboring township Somerset were both once moderately thriving logging and industrial towns, but began declining toward the late 19th century, and are now essentially ghost towns, unincorporated by an act of the state legislature in 1937. According to Citro's books, stories of strange happenings had been told about Glastenbury and the surrounding area for many years prior to the disappearances in the 1940s, the best-known of which is probably that of Paula Jean Welden. Reported disappearances =Middie Rivers (1945)= Between 1945 and 1950, five people disappeared in the Bennington area. The first occurred on November 12, 1945 when 74-year-old Middie Rivers disappeared while out hunting. Rivers was guiding a group of four hunters up the mountains. On the way back, Rivers got ahead of the group, and was never seen again. An extensive search was conducted, but the only evidence discovered was a single rifle cartridge that was found in a stream. The speculation was that Rivers had leaned over and the cartridge had dropped out of his pocket into the water. The disappearance had occurred in the Long Trail Road area and Vermont Route 9. Rivers was an experienced hunter and fisherman and was familiar with the local area. =Paula Welden (1946)= Paula Jean Welden, 18, disappeared about a year later on December 1, 1946. Welden was a sophomore at Bennington College. She had set out for a hike on the Long Trail. Many saw her go, including Ernest Whitman, a Bennington Banner employee who gave her directions. She was alleged to have been seen on the trail itself by an elderly couple who were about behind her. According to them, she turned a corner in the trail, and when they reached the same corner, she had disappeared. An extensive search was conducted when Welden didn't return to the college campus, which included the posting of a $5,000 reward and help from the FBI. However, no evidence of her was ever found. Unconfirmed rumors speculated that she had moved to Canada with a boyfriend or that she became a recluse living in the mountains. Welden's disappearance was the inspiration for the 1951 novel Hangsaman by Shirley Jackson.https://www.bustle.com/p/shirley-jacksons-horror-novel-hangsaman-was- inspired-by-a-real-life-disappearance-12217498 =James Tedford (1949)= James E. Tedford (also spelled as Teford or Tetford), a veteran, was the third person to disappear. He went missing on December 1, 1949, exactly three years after Paula Welden had disappeared. Tedford was a resident of the Bennington Soldiers' Home. He had been in St. Albans visiting relatives, and was returning home on the local bus when he vanished. According to witnesses, Tedford got on the bus, and was still on the bus at the last stop before arriving in Bennington. Somewhere between the last stop and Bennington, Tedford vanished. His belongings were still in the luggage rack and an open bus timetable was on his vacant seat. =Paul Jephson (1950)= The fourth person to vanish was eight-year-old Paul Jephson. On October 12, 1950, Jephson had accompanied his mother in a truck. She left her son unattended while she fed some pigs. His mother was gone for about an hour. When she returned, her son was nowhere in sight. Search parties were formed to look for the child. Nothing was ever found, though Jephson was wearing a bright red jacket that should have made him more visible. According to one story, bloodhounds tracked the boy to a local highway, where, according to local legend, four years earlier Paula Welden had disappeared. =Frieda Langer (1950)= The fifth and last disappearance occurred sixteen days after Jephson had vanished. On October 28, 1950, Frieda Langer, 53, and her cousin, Herbert Elsner, left their family campsite near the Somerset Reservoir to go on a hike. During the hike, Langer slipped and fell into a stream. She told Elsner if he would wait, she would go back to the campsite, change clothes and catch up to him. When she did not return, Elsner made his way back to the campsite and discovered Langer had not returned, and that nobody had seen her since they had left. Over the next two weeks, five searches were conducted, involving aircraft, helicopters, and up to 300 searchers. No trace of Langer was found during the search. On May 12, 1951, her body was found near Somerset Reservoir, in an area that had been extensively searched seven months previously. No cause of death could be determined because of the condition of her remains. Langer was the last person to disappear and the only one whose body was found. No direct connections have been identified that tie these cases together, other than the general geographic area and time period.Dooling, Michael C.

American Goddess at the Rape of Nanking: The Courage of Minnie Vautrin. Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 2000, pg. 3. After primary schooling, Vautrin attended Secor High School. During her high school career, Vautrin worked several part-time jobs to save for her schooling and volunteered at local churches. Vautrin was accepted to Illinois State Normal University in Normal, Illinois in 1903. Due to her financial situation, Vautrin had to delay her studies several times to work. When she graduated in 1907, she was ranked first in her class of 93 students and spoke at the commencement ceremonies.Lu, Suping. \\"Introduction\\". Terror in Minnie Vautrin's Nanjing. Urbana: University of Chicago Press, 2008: xix. She taught mathematics at LeRoy High School, Illinois before continuing her studies at the University of Illinois. At the University, Vautrin was president of the Student Volunteer Movement for Foreign Missions. She graduated in 1912 as salutatorian of her class with an A.B. in science. The university pastor recommended Vautrin to the recruiters of the Foreign Christian Missionary Society, who requested that she replace a teacher in China. Iris Chang notes that Vautrin was \\"Tall and Handsome in her youth, with long dark hair, she was a vivacious and popular woman who attracted numerous suitors,\\" but who decided that instead of getting married she would become a missionary.Chang, Iris, The Rape of Nanking: The forgotten holocaust of World War ll, Basic Books, A Subsidiary of Perseus Books, L.L.C., 1997 p. 130 When Vautrin received this request circa 1912, Christian missions to China, facilitated by groups such as the Foreign Christian Missionary Society, had begun to flourish as a result of the treaties ending the First Opium War (1840‚Äì42) and Second Opium War (1863-65) that opened Chinese seaports to Christianity. Hua-ling Hu, one of Vautrin's biographers and writer of American Goddess at the Rape of Nanking: The Courage of Minnie Vautrin, writes that \\"by 1914, about six thousand young Americans went to foreign countries as missionaries, over one-third of them to China.\\" Vautrin accepted the Foreign Christian Missionary Society's request to develop a girls' school in China, and when she was 26 years old, she traveled to Hofei to establish the San Ching Girls' Middle School. During her time at the school the number of pupils increased and a high school department was added. In Hofei, Vautrin also met her future fianc√©, a fellow American missionary whose name is unknown. In 1918, after serving for a period of six years in China, Minnie returned to the United States for furlough. She enrolled in Columbia University in New York City to pursue a master's degree in education, which she received in 1919. While at Columbia University, Vautrin was approached by a teacher from Ginling College, and was asked to serve as president of the institution for one year. The College was the third institution founded by a group of American missionaries who sought to \\"establish four woman's colleges in China ‚Äì one each in north, central, west, and south.\\"Feng, Jin. The Making of a Family Saga: Ginling College. Albany: SUNY University Press, 2009, p. 28. Vautrin postponed her wedding for one year in order to become the acting president at Ginling College in 1919. However, she later broke off her engagement and never married.Hu, Hua-Ling, American Goddess at the Rape of Nanking: The Courage of Minnie Vautrin. Southern Illinois University Press, April 2000; , pp. 90, 95-96. At Ginling College, Vautrin decided to extend her one-year agreement. She created courses on education administration and management, an innovative student-teaching program, and handled the planning and funding of the new campus by the West Gate of Nanking. During the fall semester of 1922, Vautrin hosted a fundraiser to build an elementary school for 150 local, mostly illiterate children who lived in the homes near Ginling College's campus. The biographer Hua-ling Hu writes that, while at Ginling College, Minnie \\"attempted to lead the students to fulfill the spirit of Ginling's motto, 'abundant life,' by making them walk out of the 'ivory tower' to see and understand the suffering of the poor and by encouraging them to devote their lives for the betterment of the society.\\" However, some of the College's staff members and students did not support Vautrin's method, who found her overbearing, conservative, and self-righteous. This may be due to her \\"watchful and interfering administrative style.\\" In 1926, after Vautrin returned from a brief visit to her family in America, the Nationalist government's Northern Expedition troops under General Chiang Kai-Shek captured Nanking. While in Nanking, the army perpetrated the Nanking Incident, which involved the destruction and looting of the city and the slaughter of native citizens as well as foreigners. Ginling College was not harmed during the looting, and Vautrin hid in the College's attic with a few others while Chiang Kai-shek's troops were on Ginling's campus. The Nanking Incident deterred many American missionaries from serving in China, and many left the country. However, Vautrin remained at Ginling College, and served as its president until the Chinese Nationalist government mandated that all colleges in China have native-born presidents. She was replaced by a Ginling graduate, Dr. Wu Yi-fang, in September 1928. In 1931, Vautrin returned to the United States on furlough and in order to care for her aging father. She returned to Ginling in 1932. On June 21, 1937, Vautrin received word that her father, Edmond, had died at the age of 83. Upon hearing of the Marco Polo Bridge Incident in 1937, Vautrin cancelled her planned furlough, scheduled for 1938, and immediately returned to Nanking from Tokyo in order to protect Ginling College and its students. Vautrin prepared intensely for the approaching Japanese army. She made arrangements to prepare the campus by sending records to Shanghai, purchased supplies, instructed students and faculty on emergency precautions, cleaned out and converting rooms in campus buildings for storage and refuge, and ordered the building of trenches. The first Japanese air raid on Nanking took place on April 14, 1937. As a result of the raid, the American embassy arranged for the evacuation of Americans from the city. In her diary, Vautrin wrote that she felt compelled to stay in Nanking: > I personally feel that I cannot leave... Men are not asked to leave their > ships when they are in danger and women are not asked to leave their > children. By September, only three Ginling students remained on campus. Due to financial strains, the salaries of the fifteen remaining faculty members at Ginling College were halved. Anticipating a direct Japanese assault on the city, the foreigners who chose to stay in Nanking organized the International Committee for the Nanking Safety Zone (ICNSZ) on November 15, 1937. The committee requested that the Japanese and Chinese governments treat a refugee zone of Nanking as neutral, and both nations agreed and granted the ICNSZ neutrality. The Japanese placed one condition on the neutrality, requiring that the neutral zone would be made void if Chinese military personnel were found hiding within it. In the first few nights of the Japanese attack on the city, 850 refugees came to Ginling College, which was designated as one of the twenty-five refugee camps in Nanking. When the Imperial Japanese Army took complete control of Nanking in December 1937, she and other foreign nationals, including John Rabe, worked to protect civilians in the Nanking Safety Zone. Ginling College took up its full role as a refugee haven, at times harboring up to 10,000 women in buildings designed to support between 200 and 300. During this period, Vautrin wrote fairly frequently in her diary. One of her entries was a prayer: > Oh, God, control the cruel beastliness of the soldiers in Nanking tonight, > comfort the heartbroken mothers and fathers whose innocent sons have been > shot today, and guard the young women and girls through the long agonizing > hours of this night. Speed the day when wars shall be no more. When thy > Kingdom will come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. When all other refugee camps closed on February 4, 1938, a large number of women and children again sought refuge at the College and a census in mid- March showed 3,310 refugees were resident there. Vautrin would patrol the campus grounds and repel incursions of Japanese soldiers into the College and rescue and care for refugees. She saw to the burial of the dead and the reception of newborn babies and was successful in tracing missing husbands and sons. Industrial or crafts classes were provided for women who had lost their husbands, so that they might support themselves. One hundred women graduated under this program. Vautrin recounted the war in her diary in 1937: > There probably is no crime that has not been committed in this city today. > Thirty girls were taken from language school last night, and today I have > heard scores of heartbreaking stories of girls who were taken from their > homes last night‚Äîone of the girls was but 12 years old. Food, bedding and > money have been taken from people. ‚Ä¶ I suspect every house in the city has > been opened, again and yet again, and robbed. Tonight a truck passed in > which there were eight or ten girls, and as it passed they called out > \\"ÊïëÂëΩÔºÅÊïëÂëΩÔºÅ Jiuming! Jiuming!\\"‚Äîsave our lives. The occasional shots that we hear > out on the hills, or on the street, make us realize the sad fate of some > man‚Äîvery probably not a soldier. On 19 December: > In my wrath, I wished I had the power to smite them for their dastardly > work. How ashamed women of Japan would be if they knew these tales of > horror. In 1938, she wrote in her diary that she had to go to the Japanese embassy repeatedly from December 18 to January 13 to get proclamations to prohibit Japanese soldiers from committing crimes at Ginling because the soldiers tore the documents up before taking women away. Near the end of her service at Ginling College, Vautrin wrote several entries that lacked her previous determination and optimism. Among these was April 14, 1940: > I'm about at the end of my energy. Can no longer forge ahead and make plans > for the work, for on every hand there seems to be obstacles of some kind. In the spring of 1940, suffering from severe stress probably due to worry about the fate of Ginling College and its students, Vautrin was accompanied back to the United States by a colleague. After attempting to commit suicide using sleeping pills, Vautrin appeared to recover for a short while. However, she later committed suicide by turning on the stove gas in her apartment in Indianapolis. She was 54 years old.Lu, Suping & Minnie Vautrin, Terror in Minnie Vautrin's Nanjing: Diaries and Correspondence, 1937-38, 2008, University of Illinois Press. pp. xxvii-xxviii One entry in her journal, recorded shortly before her death, displays her devotion to Ginling College and the people of China, whom she served for 28 years as a Christian missionary: > Had I ten perfect lives, I would give them all to China. Legacy After the war, Vautrin was posthumously awarded the Emblem of the Blue Jade by the Chinese government for her sacrifices during the Nanjing Massacre. Her work saving the lives of Chinese civilians during the massacre is recounted in the biographical book, American Goddess at the Rape of Nanking, written by historian Hu, Hua-Ling. In the 2007 documentary film Nanking, Vautrin was portrayed by actress Mariel Hemingway, who recited excerpts from Vautrin's diary. The Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall is a museum built by the Nanjing Municipal Government to memorialize the 300,000 victims of the Nanjing massacre, the survivors, and those who tried to protect the people of Nanjing during the atrocity. In the museum, there is a memorial to Minnie Vautrin. Additionally, there is a statue of Vautrin in Jinling Women's College, among memorials to the other non-Chinese individuals who helped to protect the College and its inhabitants during the Nanjing massacre. The hardcore band Hiretsukan honors Wilhelmina Vautrin in their song Song For Wilhelmina Vautrin on their 2005 record End States. Other She is depicted in Lu Chuan's 2009 film City of Life and Death. In the 2009 movie on John Rabe, Minnie Vautrin is replaced by a fictive Val√©rie Dupres of an \\"International Girls College\\" as an important fellow Nanking Safety Zone committee member. In Nanjing Requiem, a 2011 novel by Chinese-born writer and Boston University professor Ha Jin, Ha writes from the perspective of a fictionalized assistant to Vautrin named Anling Gao. Minnie Vautrin's diaries provided inspiration for the novella 13 Flowers of Nanjing written by Geling Yan, which was the basis for the 2011 film, The Flowers of War (ÈáëÈôµÂçÅ‰∏âÈáµ; pinyin: Jƒ´nl√≠ng Sh√≠sƒÅn ChƒÅi), directed by Zhang Yimou.

He is one of the founders of punk band The Mekons, post-punk group The Three Johns, and alternative country ensembles The Waco Brothers and Pine Valley Cosmonauts. He has worked to campaign against the death penalty in Illinois.  Early life  Langford was born in Newport, Wales, the youngest son of Kit Langford and Denis Langford, a Registered Chartered Accountant for Lloyd's Brewery. Langford's older brother is science-fiction author and critic David Langford, who lives in Reading, England. When he was young, Langford would visit his grandparents in Croesyceiliog, whose family friend ran two pubs, the Cambrian Arms and The Six in Hand. He attended Gaer Infants School and Gaer Junior School, then Brynglas Primary School, the Newport High School middle school, before Queen's Hill. In 1972‚Äì1973, after playing rugby and football, at the age of 15 Langford decided he liked playing music better. He played a lot of David Bowie and was listening to a lot of Man. Langford attended art school at University of Leeds as a painter. He left school temporarily when the Mekons were founded, but later went back to college and finished his degree. Music Since the mid-1980s, Langford has been one of the leaders in incorporating folk and country music into punk rock. He has released a number of solo recordings as well as recordings with other bands outside of The Mekons, most notably the Waco Brothers, which he co-founded after moving to Chicago in the early 1990s. He is involved with the Chicago-based independent record label Bloodshot. In a 2010 interview, Langford said his earliest influences were Tom Jones, Slade, T. Rex, The Kinks, Johnny Cash, Man and Black Sabbath. = The Mekons = Langford was originally the drummer for the punk band The Mekons when it formed at the University of Leeds in 1977, but he later took up the guitar as other band members left. The Mekons were signed to Virgin Records but according to Langford they \\"got fired.\\" They played their first US appearance on New Year's Eve in 1980, gave up live performances for a while, and released 1982's The Mekons Story. They began performing again in public in 1984, playing their first shows as benefits for the British miners' union. After being signed by major American label A&M; Records in the late 1980s, label shuffling resulted in the band trying to leave the label. In response, they gave the label, The Curse of the Mekons, which became only available overseas as an import. A documentary called The Revenge of the Mekons was released in 2014 by director Joe Angio. The Mekons continue to record and perform live, as of 2019. =The Three Johns= With John Hyatt and Phillip Brennan, Langford released several albums of drum-machine-fueled punk between 1982 and 1987. A retrospective box set was released in August 2015. = The Waco Brothers = The Waco Brothers make country-punk music, and are a Chicago-based amalgam of players from the Pine Valley Cosmonauts family and others, who have been recording since 1995. For their first albums, they included Dean Schlabowske (guitar/vocal), Tracey Dear (mandolin/vocal), Alan Doughty (bass/vocal), Mark Durante (pedal steel guitar), and Mekons drummer Steve Goulding) By 2015, Goulding, now based in New York City, had been replaced by Joe Camarillo (drums), and Durante had left. = Pine Valley Cosmonauts = Langford initiated another project, the Pine Valley Cosmonauts, which performs the music of other country music groups. Several alternative country musicians have guested alongside a revolving assortment of Chicago musicians who have backed both Langford and other musicians such as Kelly Hogan. = Wee Hairy Beasties = Wee Hairy Beasties were a children's music group based in Chicago, composed of Jon Langford, Sally Timms, Kelly Hogan, and Devil in a Woodpile. They played their first gig together at the Brookfield Zoo near Chicago, and released two albums in 2006 and 2008. = Solo, Skull Orchard, etc. = Langford's first official solo album, Skull Orchard, a look back at his hometown of Newport, Wales, was released in 1998. He followed it with All the Fame of Lofty Deeds, in 2004, Gold Brick in 2006, Old Devils in 2010 and Here Be Monsters in 2014. Langford and Sally Timms, the other Chicago-based member of the Mekons, continue to collaborate on various recording and performance projects, as of 2020. Circa 2003, Langford started the band \\"Ship & Pilot\\", to perform his songs. It continued to perform into 2006, and very occasionally since. Ship & Pilot also included Sally Timms, Tony Maimone, Jean Cook, and on drums variously Steve Goulding or Dan Massey. In the late 2000s Langford came into contact with the Burlington Welsh Male Chorus based near Toronto. He invited them first to accompany him at a CeltFest in Chicago in 2007, and then to re-record the whole of the Skull Orchard. The album Skull Orchard Revisited (credited to Jon Langford and the Burlington Welsh Male Chorus) was released on 3 June 2011 by Bloodshot Records. 2010's Old Devils is a follow up to the first Skull Orchard album. At the 2014 Hideout Block Party in Chicago, Langford debuted the band Bad Luck Jonathan (a name likely inspired by that of then-president of Nigeria, Goodluck Jonathan). The band, described as \\"socialist voodoo space boogie\\", featured Alan Doughty and Joe Camarillo from the Waco Brothers, Phil Wandscher from Whiskeytown, and Martin Billheimer from Chicago's Pritzker Military Museum and Library. Four Lost Souls is a collaboration between Langford, John Szymanski, Tawny Newsome and Bethany Thomas. Their eponymous debut album was produced by Norbert Putnam and released in 2017. =Men of Gwent= Are a group of mainly Newport-based musicians, including members of Give Me Memphis and The Darling Buds. Previously known as LL, the group have written and recorded intermittently for over 20 years, and have been playing live since 2007. As LL, their only release was a demo track (\\"Rechem\\") on the 1999 compilation Fear of a Red Planet. Debut album The Legend of LL was released on Country Mile Records in 2015 and included reworkings of several songs from the same LL demos, as well as a new version of \\"Pill Sailor\\", first released on Skull Orchard in 1998.

His artwork is available from the Yard Dog Art Gallery in Austin, TX and LeMieux Galleries in New Orleans, LA. Nashville Radio, a collection of his artwork and writings, was published in 2006. For over 10 years, Langford illustrated the comic strip Great Pop Things under the pseudonym Chuck Death with a friend from his hometown, Newport, Wales, Colin B. Morton, who wrote the text. The cartoon strip was published in alternative weekly newspapers in Los Angeles and Chicago, and was a pen-and-ink history of rock-and-roll. An anthology of the best strips was published in a book of the same name. In 2015, Langford was commissioned by the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum to paint a series of portraits for its \\"Dylan, Cash, and the Nashville Cats: A New Music City\\" exhibition, which opened on 27 March 2015. That commission lead to a collaboration between Langford and Hatch Showprint Master Printer Jim Sherraden. Out of this collaboration, their artwork was adapted for the album cover of the 2016 double-LP Trio: Farther Along by Dolly Parton, Linda Ronstadt, and Emmylou Harris. Since 2015, Langford has designed covers for a series of novels by author Jay Spencer Green, including Breakfast at Cannibal Joe's and Ivy Feckett is Looking for Love.

Biography Thomas was born in Pensacola, Florida, to British parents John D. Thomas and Sibyl Addenbrooke. He had two younger brothers, John and David. His father, a Presbyterian minister who was ethnically Welsh, and his mother, a schoolteacher who was ethnically English, stressed the importance of reading, education, and memorization to their son. Thomas says that his father stressed mental images as an important speaking tool. For example, he told his son if he were talking about horses he had to picture horses in his mind. Thomas began his career at 14 as an announcer on a local radio show. Since the station could not pay him due to his age, they arranged for the sponsor, Piper Aircraft, to give him flying lessons in a Piper Cub. Within just a few years, Thomas would be hosting Big Band remotes. With the onset of World War II, Thomas left The Stony Brook School and volunteered for the United States Army in 1943, after being offered an Armed Forces Radio deferment, and served with the First Infantry Division in five major campaigns, including the Battle of Normandy and the Battle of the Bulge. He was issued a Battle star for each of the five campaigns. He was also awarded the Bronze Star, the Purple Heart, the Unit French Croix de guerre, and Belgian Fourrag√®re. Thomas received many awards for his work but cited, as one of his best, the Oscar won by a documentary he narrated, One Survivor Remembers. The film, produced by HBO, chronicles the personal experience of Gerda Weissman Klein, who was interned at the Nordhausen Concentration Camp when she was a teenager; Thomas' unit participated in the liberation of Nordhausen. Klein and Thomas met during the post-production of the documentary, and again at its premiere. Thomas also participated in an HBO film on the Battle of H√ºrtgen Forest, in which he fought with the 1st Infantry Division (United States). Thomas was also the narrator for a miniseries that ran on The Discovery Channel in 1993 entitled How the West was Lost. Thomas was the narrator for the two-hour Nova episode entitled \\"D-Day's Sunken Secrets,\\" broadcast May 28, 2014, just before the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings; in his youth, he had participated in the original D-Day landing on Omaha Beach. Thomas married his high school sweetheart, Stella (n√©e Barrineau) Thomas, on June 29, 1946; she died on June 16, 2014. The couple raised three children (Peter Jr., Doug, and Elizabeth) in Greenwich, Connecticut, and in 1985, they settled in Naples, Florida. He was heavily involved in work with veterans, having served on the board of the National D-Day Memorial Foundation and in other similar roles. Having been involved in liberating Nordhausen, Thomas also was a strong supporter of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum; he narrated the museum's original audio tour and documentary. He worked at his home and, through ISDN, at recording studios throughout the United States. Also using ISDN, he continued narrating at recording studios in New York City, where he worked for the bulk of his narration career. Before pursuing narration full-time, he was a New York anchor for CBS News. He continued to keep an apartment in midtown Manhattan for recordings that required his presence there. Thomas also recorded in many European capitals. =Death= Thomas died on April 30, 2016, at the age of 91.

She was beatified by the Catholic Church for the holiness of her life. Her feast day is 7 February. Life She was born Jeanne-Marie Rendu on 9 September 1786, in Confort, France, not far from Geneva. The eldest of four girls, she came from a family of small property owners which enjoyed a certain affluence and respect throughout the area. She was baptized the day she was born in the parish church of Lancrans. Her godfather by proxy was Jacques Emery, a family friend and future Superior General of the Society of Saint-Sulpice (Sulpicians) in Paris. Rendu was three years old when the Revolution broke out. Starting in 1790 it was compulsory for the clergy to take an oath of support for the Civil Constitution of the Clergy. Numerous priests, faithful to the Church, refused to take this oath. They were driven from their parishes, with some being put to death and others having to hide to escape their pursuers. The Rendu family home became a refuge for these priests, some fleeing to Switzerland. The Bishop of Annecy found asylum there under the assumed name of Pierre. Jeanne- Marie was fascinated by this hired hand who was treated better than the others. One night she discovered that he was celebrating a Mass. It was in this atmosphere of faith, exposed to the dangers of denunciation, that Rendu was educated. She made her First Communion one night by candlelight in the basement of her home. This exceptional environment forged her character. The death of her father, 12 May 1796, and that of her youngest sister, at four months of age, on 19 July of the same year, shook the entire family. Rendu, aware of her responsibility as the eldest, helped her mother, especially in caring for her younger sisters. Madame Rendu, concerned about the education of her eldest daughter, sent her to the Ursuline Sisters in Gex. Jeanne Marie stayed two years in this boarding school. She was \\"highly intelligent\\" but her education was essentially practical. During her walks in town, she discovered the hospital where the Daughters of Charity cared for the sick. She had only one desire, to go and join them. Her mother gave her consent that Jeanne- Marie, in spite of her young age, might spend some time at this hospital. There she gained some experience in caring for the sick. Daughter of Charity Having decided to join the Daughters of Charity, on 25 May 1802, Rendu arrived at the Motherhouse on the Rue du Vieux Colombier in Paris. She was nearly 17 years old. The reopening of the novitiate (suppressed by the Revolutionaries) took place in December 1800. On their arrival, the travelers were welcomed by fifty young women in formation. Upon entering the community, she was given the name of Rosalie. As a young sister, Rendu suffered from a delicate constitution that was weakened by the sustained seclusion required of the novices, and by a lack of physical exercise. On the advice of her physician and that of her godfather, the Abb√© Emery, Rendu was sent to house of the Daughters of Charity on Rue des Francs-Bourgeois-Saint-Marcel in the Mouffetard District. She remained there 54 years. At the time, it was one of the most impoverished districts of the quickly expanding capital, with poverty in all its forms, psychological and spiritual. The houses were dilapidated and damp, the streets narrow and squalid, with refuse-filled streams running across them. She made her \\"apprenticeship\\" accompanying sisters visiting the sick and the poor. Between times, she taught catechism and reading to little girls accepted at the free school. In 1807, Rendu, surrounded by the Sisters of her Community, made vows for the first time to serve God and the poor. Sister Servant Soeur Rosalie Rendu plaque - 3 rue de l√âp√©e de Bois, Paris 5 In 1815 Rendu became the Sister Servant (local religious superior) of the community at the Rue des Francs-Bourgeois. Two years later the community would move to the Rue de l'√âp√©e de Bois for reasons of space and convenience. \\"Her poor,\\" as she would call them, became more and more numerous during this troubled time. She worked with the Department of Welfare established by the Napoleonic government, administering a program that provided vouchers for coal and food. She sent her Sisters into all the hidden recesses of St. M√©dard Parish in order to bring supplies, clothing, care and a comforting word. She dealt with the poor with great consideration, guessing that they are much more sensitive to the manner in which one helps them than to the help itself. \\"One of the greatest ways of doing good to the poor\\", she affirmed, \\"is to show them respect and consideration.\\" Rendu's example encouraged her Sisters. Rendu found her strength in a saying of the founder of the Daughters, Vincent de Paul: \\"You will go and visit the poor ten times a day, and ten times a day you will find God there ... you go into their poor homes, but you find God there.\\" Her prayer life was intense, as a Sister affirmed, \\"... she continually lived in the presence of God.\\" Rendu was attentive to assuring that her companions had time for prayer, but sometimes there was a need to \\"leave God for God\\" as Vincent de Paul taught his Daughters. Once, while accompanying a Sister on a charitable visit, she said to her: \\"Sister, let's begin our meditation!\\" She suggested the plan, the outline, in a few simple, clear words and entered into prayer. Like a monk in the cloister, Rendu walked everywhere with her God. She would speak to God of this family in distress as the father no longer had any work, of this elderly person who risked dying alone in an attic: \\"Never have I prayed so well as in the streets,\\" she would say. Superiors sent Rendu postulants and young Sisters to train. They put in her house, for a period of time, Sisters who were somewhat difficult or fragile. To one of her Sisters in crisis, she gave this advice one day, which is the secret of her life: \\"If you want someone to love you, you must be the first to love; and if you have nothing to give, give yourself.\\" As the number of Sisters increased, the charity office became a house of charity, with a clinic and a school. She saw in that the Providence of God. In the outbreaks which followed the Revolution of 1830 Archbishop Quelen and other clergy took shelter at the Rue de l'√âp√©e de Bois.\\"Blessed Rosalie Rendu\\", Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul To assist all the suffering, Rendu opened a free clinic, a pharmacy, a school, a child and maternal care center, a youth club for young workers and a home for the elderly without resources. For young girls and needy mothers, Rendu soon organized courses in sewing and embroidering. Soon a whole network of charitable services would be established to counter poverty. Rendu was very mindful of the manner of receiving the poor. Her spirit of faith saw in them our \\"lords and masters.\\" \\"The poor will insult you. The ruder they are; the more dignified you must be,\\" she said. \\"Remember, Our Lord hides behind those rags.\\" One of Rendu's companions remarked that, \\"the poor themselves noted her way of praying and acting.\\" \\"Humble in her authority, Sr. Rosalie would correct us with great sensitivity and had the gift of consoling. Her advice, spoken justly and given with all her affection, penetrated souls.\\" Rendu's reputation quickly grew in all the districts of the capital and also beyond to the towns in the region. She knew how to surround herself with many efficient and dedicated collaborators. The donations flowed in quickly as the rich were unable to resist this persuasive woman. Even the former royalty did not forget her in their generosity. Bishops, priests, the Spanish Ambassador, King Charles X, the powerful General Louis-Eug√®ne Cavaignac, and the most distinguished men of state and culture, even the Emperor Napoleon III with his wife, were often seen in her parlor. Students of law, medicine, science, technology, engineering, teacher‚Äëtraining, and all the other important schools came seeking from Rendu information and recommendations. Or, before performing a good work, they asked her at which door they should knock. Rendu became the center of a charitable movement that characterized Paris and France in the first half of the 19th century. Her experience was priceless for these young people. She directed their apostolate, guided their coming and going in the suburbs, and gave them addresses of families in need, choosing them with care. Afterwards, she facilitated discussion and apostolic reflection on their experiences among persons who were poor. Her cousin, Eugene Rendu, said wrote of her: \\"Sister Rosalie‚Äôs principal character trait was her common sense, pushed to the point of genius.\\" In 1833 began mentoring the first members of the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul. Among these, Fr√©d√©ric Ozanam, founder of the \\"Society of St. Vincent de Paul,\\" and Jean L√©on Le Prevost, future founder of the Religious of St. Vincent de Paul, knew well the road to her office. They came, with their other friends, to Rendu seeking advice for undertaking their projects. In 1840 she helped re-establish the Ladies of Charity, who helped in the home visits. In 1851 she took over the running of an orphanage. Rendu also formed a relationship with the Superior of Bon Saveur in Caen and requested that she too welcome those in need. She was particularly attentive to priests and religious suffering from psychiatric difficulties. Her correspondence is short but touching, considerate, patient and respectful towards all. Hardships were not lacking in the Mouffetard District. Epidemics of cholera followed one after another. Lack of hygiene and poverty fostered its virulence. Most particularly in 1832 and 1846, the dedication shown and risks taken by Rendu and her Sisters were beyond imagination. The sisters attended to the living, accompanied the dying, and buried the dead. She herself was seen picking up dead bodies in the streets. In February 1848, barricades and bloody battles were the marks of the opposition of the working class stirred up against the powerful. The Archbishop of Paris, Denis Auguste Affre, was killed trying to intervene between the fighting factions. Rendu was deeply grieved by this. She herself climbed the barricades to try to help the wounded fighters without considering their political loyalties in the fight. Without any fear, she risked her life in these confrontations. Her courage and sense of freedom commanded the admiration of all. When order was reestablished, Rendu tried to save a number of these people she knew and who were victims of fierce repression. She was helped a great deal by the mayor of the district, Dr. Ulysse Tr√©lat, a true republican, who was also very popular. In 1852, Napoleon III decided to give her the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor. She was ready to refuse this individual honor but Jean-Baptiste Etienne, Superior General of the Congregation of the Mission and the Daughters of Charity, made her accept it. Death Tombe Rosalie Rendu, Cimeti√®re du Montparnasse Always in fragile health, Rendu never took a moment of rest, always managing to overcome fatigue and fevers. However, age, increasing infirmity, and the amount of work needing to be done eventually broke her strong resistance and equally strong will. During the last two years of her life she became progressively blind. She died on 7 February 1856 after a brief but acute illness. Emotions ran high in the district and at all levels of society in both Paris and the countryside. After the funeral rite at St. M√©dard Church, her parish, a large and emotional crowd followed her remains to the Montparnasse Cemetery. They came to show their respect for the works she had accomplished and show their affection for this \\"out of the ordinary\\" Sister. Numerous newspaper articles witnessed to the admiration and even veneration that Rendu received. Newspapers from all sides echoed the sentiments of the people. L'Univers, the principal Catholic newspaper of the time, edited by Louis Veuillot, wrote as early as 8 February: \\"Our readers understand the significance of the sadness that has come upon the poor of Paris. They join their sufferings with the tears and prayers of the unfortunate\\". Le Constitutionnel, the newspaper of the anticlerical left, did not hesitate to announce the death of this Daughter of Charity: \\"The unfortunate people of the 12th district have just experienced a regrettable loss. Sr. Rosalie, Superior of the Community at rue de l'Ep√©e de Bois died yesterday after a long illness. For many years this respectable woman was the salvation of the numerous needy in this district\\". The official newspaper of the Empire, le Moniteur Universel, praised the kindly actions of this Sister: \\"Funeral honors were given to Sr. Rosalie with unusual splendor. For more than fifty years this holy woman was a friend to others in a district where there are many unfortunate people to care for and all these grateful people accompanied her remains to the church and to the cemetery. A guard of honor was part of the cortege\\". Many visitors came to the cemetery to meditate and pray but had difficuly locating the common gravesite reserved for the Daughters of Charity. The body was then moved to a more accessible plot, close to the entrance of the cemetery.

According to social theory, this class protects and perpetuates itself by valuing family background, prestigious education, loyalty to friends/classmates/hometown, and chaebol wealth, while those excluded from the class are unable to access these prerequisites for class membership. Leaders of admired institutions, such as Samsung, are often insulated from criticism,https://www.theverge.com/2012/11/30/3709688/samsung-25-years-lee- kun-hee but there is occasionally popular backlash against the perceived abuses of the elite class, such as the 2014 Korean Air \\"nut rage\\" scandal.http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/korean-air-nut-rage-scandal-5-things- to-know-about-heather-cho-hyun-ah The idea of a contemporary Korean ruling class has an important basis in the historical stratification of Korean society, but the exact function of the historical connection is a topic of debate. Prior to the 20th century, the dynastic traditions of Confucianism and the historical legacy of the yangban shaped the Korean aristocracy. On the one hand, the parallels can be seen today in the prestige of elite educational credentials, the wealth of landowners in South Korea's tight real estate market, as well as Confucian ideals of paternalism and loyalty to social connections formed during youth. On the other hand, the parallels are at best symbolic and at worst misleading. As a result of over 35 years of Japanese occupation and the subsequent Korean war, the older Korean polity and its traditions were broken off. Historical Background =Buddhist monks in comparison to medieval monastic power= As monastic orders did during the Europe's Middle Ages, the Buddhist monks became the purveyors and guardians of Korea's literary traditions while documenting Korea's written history and legacies from the Silla period to the end of the Goryeo dynasty. Korean buddhist monks also developed and used the first movable metal type printing presses in history‚Äîsome 50 years before Gutenberg‚Äîto print ancient buddhist texts. Buddhist monks also engaged in record keeping, food storage and distribution, as well as the ability to exercise power by influencing the Goryeo royal court. =Bone Rank System of Silla= The bone rank system was the system of aristocratic rank used in the ancient Korean kingdom of Silla. It was used to segregate society, and particularly the layers of the aristocracy, on the basis of their hereditary proximity to the throne and the level of authority they were permitted to wield.The idea of royal blood in other societies is a close analogue to the idea of sacred bone in Silla thought. Bone rank was strictly hereditary, and thus acted as a caste system. =Korean ruling classes in the Goryeo dynasty= =Neo-Confucian Joseon period yangban leadership= The yangban Confucian scholars grew to prominence during the Joseon dynasty period. From the late 14th century onwards, the yangban class formed the administrative backbone of the Korean nation. They occupied the highest echelon of social caste system. =Japanese colonial rule period= The annexation of Korea by Japan from 1905 to 1945 ushered in not only a harsh colonial period wherein the Japanese took over and dominated every aspect of Korea's sociopolitical, cultural and economic life, it created a demand for Koreans skilled in working alongside the Japanese as petty bureaucrats, minor officials, junior administrators, clerks and low-level public officials such as policemen, station masters, railroad engineers, and army officers. This fostered the need and creation of a skilled indigenous workforce trained and schooled in Japanese ways and methods. Although small in number, this elite group of Koreans represented the first generation of Korean yuhaksaeng(Ïú†ÌïôÏÉù), or overseas students, to be sent abroad for foreign study. From 1910 to 1945 these Koreans studied mostly in Japan's best high schools and universities, especially Tokyo Imperial University. While many overseas Korean students were forcibly conscripted into the Imperial Japanese Army to fight against the allies, many survived the war mostly by being able to evade routine roundups by the Japanese police, usually with the help of sympathetic Japanese teachers and mentors. After Korea's liberation from Japan on August 15, 1945, they immediately were called upon to form Korea's first provisional government in conjunction with a U.S.-administered trusteeship. As they represented the only class of Koreans who were capable of administering the newly formed Republic of Korea upon its establishment in 1948, they became the de facto inheritors of the Japanese colonial system and founders of the first sovereign Korean state in modern times. Among their ranks were a generation's worth of Japanese-trained and educated bureaucrats, administrators, technocrats, military and business leaders, e.g., Park Chung-hee, Lee Byung- chul, etc. In toto, these trailblazers who were educated in Japan during the colonial period, became the founding members of the Republic of Korea as well as movers and shakers in Korean politics and business all the way up till the late 1980s. Collectively, this generation is called the Japanese Generation. =Post World War II= After the Korean war and by the 1960s, a new generation of heavy manufacturing millionaires and soon to be billionaires came into being. * Chung Ju Yung, (1915‚Äì2001) the founder of the Hyundai Group and the richest man in Korea in the 1990s with over 170,000 employees. Business elites and ruling classes Korea's first group of business, political and academic elites was the Japanese Generation, or specifically, those Koreans born during the waning days of the Joseon dynasty or the early years of the colonial period, who were trained and educated exclusively in Japan at elite universities and military academies during the Japanese colonial period from 1910 to 1945. This first generation of Korean overseas students, who as returnees to their native country after Korea's liberation from Japan in 1945, were called upon to form the first sovereign Korean state in modern history. Their studies in administration, agriculture and engineering and other subjects that the Japanese had deemed useful in the creation of a Korean administrative sub-class, were quickly put to use in filling the administrative void and power vacuum left behind by the departing Japanese colonial government. By quickly assuming key technical and administrative positions in South Korea's fledgling government and bureaucracy, as well as assuming leadership in its post-colonial military and police force at the behest of U.S. trusteeship, Korea's Japanese Generation proved themselves as quick learners adept at jump starting Korea's ancient tradition of self-rule. These Koreans were also instrumental in forming, creating and leading Korea's post-war governmental institutions and driving its export-oriented economy well into the 1990s. Today, near the end of the first decade of the 21st century, while a majority of the Japanese Generation has long since retired or passed on, their legacy continues to drive Korea's sociopolitical and economic scene for the time being, albeit less and less so. Meanwhile, increasing numbers of overseas educated Koreans‚Äîthis time trained in the West and fluent in English‚Äîcontinue to return to Korea after their studies in overwhelming numbers seeking commensurate positions in Korea's public and private sector in order to establish their own imprimatur on Korean society based on their own experiences and learning acquired during their stints abroad as students studying at some of the best universities in America and Europe. The overall impact of such disparate experiences in terms of influencing Korea's sociopolitical geography and economic millieu for the future is debatable though, as the current generation differs substantially from its predecessors. Specifically, Korea's current generation, although better educated and more privileged in many respects, lack a defining and unifying experience for their generation. The Japanese Generation, on the other hand was largely successful in terms of acting as Korea's legitimate power elites because they were able to quickly coalesce by capitalizing on the defining and unifying experience of their generation, which was the strong resentment of Korea's poverty and low status attributed to Japanese colonization and the Korean War. As a result, that generation felt an overwhelming obligation to put Korea on the right track at all costs, in order to prevent another return to an abysmal state. Technocrat elites and ruling classes Technocrats with degrees in the sciences or engineering have mostly been subsumed in power and influence in the political process, but have contributed to great success in the larger manufacturing combines, energy and resource cartels, chaebols, and cross-linked industries. Tele-com and internet elites and ruling classes By 2005, a new ruling elite spurred by telecommunications and the internet had come into being: and English studies abroad fell, with a new class of elite studying in China, and planning on extensive business dealings with China upon graduation. At the same time because of the similarity of the Turkic languages to Korean, there have been extensive links with Mongolia launching new elites who will base their fortunes upon export and development in this region. The Korean rich list There is currently no published Korean rich list, despite the Wikipedia entry, but Forbes and other chroniclers of the power elites of the world have found sufficient high profile rich in Korea as to generate accurate numbers. Forbes magazine has hinted at Korea having at the very least 7 high billionaires living on the peninsula, and at least ten families alone who control in the high billions in assets. There are possibly another 5 Korean billionaires abroad, mostly in the USA who maintain dual citizenship. Low billionaire families are generally accepted to number more than 10 and less than 20; while domestic newspapers have indicated that there are at least 100 families who have more than $250 million in assets: primarily real estate and land being developed; or in manufacturing who have a high enough profile as to be reasonably defined as amongst the very wealthy of the world. Estimates on the number of Koreans who own more than a million US dollars in assets apart from their houses, and discarding all debts, are figured to be in the range of 65,000 high-net-worth individuals (HNWI) according to Merrill Lynch research by June 16, 2004.

He appeared in almost every issue until #41 (April 1944). The character was revived in the Modern Age in Femforce #59, by AC Comics, and in Tom Strong #11, by Alan Moore and Chris Sprouse. Character history His secret identity is Professor Archibald (Archie) Masters, an astronomy professor at an unnamed university in the Eastern United States. The character debuted in 1941, his mousy alter-ego being similar to that of Superman's Clark Kent identity. He accidentally got caught in a room with a device called an atom smasher, and, inevitably, the experiment went awry. Instead of killing him, the accident blasted him with radiation, which endowed him with various superhuman abilities. He used these powers to fight crime as the American Crusader. Cribbed from Superman's relationship with Lois Lane, Prof. Masters has a secretary named Jane Peters, who despised the professor but idolized the hero. The Crusader also briefly has a teen sidekick named Mickey Martin. His enemies include Nazis, mad scientists, and Nazi mad scientists, as well as Nazi zombies. The Crusader appeared in the following titles in the Golden Age: * America's Best Comics #6 * Thrilling Comics #19-35, 37-39, 41 Revivals =AC Comics= The American Crusader, along with other heroes from Nedor Comics, was revived by AC Comics through the Vault of Heroes, a suspended animation program for superheroes. He later joined the Sentinels of Justice. =America's Best Comics= The American Crusader, along with other heroes from Nedor Comics, was revived by Alan Moore in his series Tom Strong. This revival set the characters on a parallel world called Terra Obscura, which was also the title of the resulting mini-series. The Crusader apparently (from a Terra Obscura continuity standpoint) operated as a superhero until 1969, when, on a mission to stop an alien from converting Earth into a spaceship, he was imprisoned in an alien restraining device which Tom Strong imagined to be a heavily localized time- loop. This bubble kept him in suspended animation until he was freed in 2000 by Strong and his fellow SMASH member, Tom Strange. Within the Terra Obscura continuity, he is an alcoholic, currently seeking help for his addiction. He operates with the modern incarnation of SMASH. =Living Legends and Tales of the Living Legends= The American Crusader made a brief appearance in the prose story Living Legends, published by Metahuman Press. A flashback comic story featuring rescripted pages over the comic work has also been published as part of the Tales of the Living Legends webcomic. =Project Superpowers= The American Crusader appears in the mini-series Project Superpowers, by Alex Ross and Jim Krueger. He is kept imprisoned and unconscious by a totalitarian government, and clones called Crusaders are created from his DNA to function as super-powered soldiers. In the related Black Terror series, the Black Terror finds Archie and helps him to lure the Crusaders and destroy them, using the last of Archie's energy in the process. The Crusaders all die, and an African-American soldier named Marcus Chamberlain, who was with Archie and the Terror at the last moment, gains the power and becomes the new American Crusader. =Heroes Inc.= Archibald Masters, the American Crusader, appears as a center character in the ongoing webcomic Heroes Inc., created in 2009 by Scott E. Austin. The webcomic takes place in an alternate reality where the allies of World War II lost the war. In present day, the American Crusader gathers DNA from Golden Age heroes in order to create a new generation of heroes. =DC Comics= A version of the character was used in the Multiversity series, where he was the leader of a superteam on a parallel Earth, called the Retaliators (a reference to Captain America and his Avengers). A second version of the character is killed at the beginning of the story to raise the stakes, and the character is shown on the cover of a comic read by a character during the story. Powers and abilities The American Crusader is capable of flight, superhuman strength, invulnerability to bullets, and electromagnetic pulse generation. The full extent of his powers at this time is unknown.

Other prominent members of the gang include Chhota Shakeel, Tiger Memon,http://www.firstpost.com/india/its-official-again-ahead-of-nsa-talks- fresh-photo-passport-copy-of-dawood-confirm-hes-in-pakistan-2403302.html Yakub Memon (linked), Abu Salem and Fazlur rahman . The organization has a history of rivalry with the Mumbai police and other underworld dons such as Chhota Rajan, Ejaz Lakdawala, who was arrested in Canada in 2004, and Arun Gawli. History In the 1970s, Dawood Ibrahim worked for a local smuggler named Bashu Dada. Bashu Dada had a close friendship with Dawood's father, who was a police constable. His father wielded immense clout among the gangsters and common people due to his sense of morality and justice, while also being a part of the Crime Branch. However, Bashu Dada and Dawood had a falling-out after Bashu Dada insulted the latter's father. In 1976, Dawood ‚Äî along with seven of his close friends and his elder brother Shabir Ibrahim Kaskar ‚Äî attacked Basu Dada with empty soda bottles, a first in the history of gang warfare in Bombay. After this incident Bashu Dada's key enforcer Khalid Pehlwan persuaded Dawood to start his smuggling operations, which led to the formation of the D Company. Dawood and his elder brother Shabir, with the help of Khalid Pehlwan, began their smuggling operations. This ultimately led them to clash with the Pathan gang, the most influential gang in Mumbai at the time. By 1986, D Company had eliminated most of the Pathan gang leadership, emerging as the dominant gang in Mumbai. In 1993, D-Company associates were accused of organizing the 1993 Bombay bombings. , although Dawood denies any involvement to this day. In 1997, D-Company former member Abu Salem and Fazlur Rahman was responsible for the murder of T-Series founder and Bollywood music producer Gulshan Kumar. In 2011, Indian intelligence agencies managed to link Dawood Company with the 2G spectrum case, through DB Realty and DB Etisalat (formerly Swan Telecom) promoted by Shahid Balwa. Later in March, security at CBI headquarters in Delhi was tightened after it had been suggested that D-Company might launch an attack in an attempt to destroy documents relating to the ongoing probe of the 2G spectrum case. In 2015, a US Congressional report alleged that the D-Company was a \\"5,000-member criminal syndicate operating mostly in Pakistan, India, and the United Arab Emirates,\\" which has a \\"strategic alliance\\" with ISI and has \\"forged relationships with Islamists, including Lashkar-e-Taiba and al-Qaida.\\" However, the report had no political implications, and was mainly to brief lawmakers. In 2018, Dr Louise Shelley, Professor at the George Mason University, stated that the D-Company was now mainly based in Pakistan and had diversified its assets like Mexican drug organisations¬ª.Dawood Ibrahim's D-company has diversified, US lawmakers told, Indiatimes.com, 23 March 2018 (accessed on 30 July 2019) Dawood was also wire- taped by Indian investigators who found out he had real estate assets in Dubai under someone else's name.Arvind Ojha, Divyesh Singh, Caught on tape: How underworld don Dawood Ibrahim manages his business empire, Indiatoday.in, 9 April 2018 (accessed on 30 July 2019) In popular culture At times, Dawood Company has been linked to the Bollywood film industry, as well as real estate and betting businesses, from which it is said to derive considerable revenue. The 2002 film Company is based loosely on its activities, as well as its sequel (prequel to the storyline) D (2005), Shootout at Lokhandwala (2007), and Once Upon a Time in Mumbai (2010). The 2013 film Shootout at Wadala is based on the rise of the D-Company. It also features in Salman Rushdie's 2018 novel The Golden House, where it is called Z-Company.

The founding members of the kibbutz were primarily from the United Kingdom, South Africa, the United States and the Baltic countries. The kibbutz was named in honor of L√©on Blum, the Jewish socialist former Prime Minister of France who was the focus of a widely publicized, and ultimately unsuccessful, show trial in 1942 mounted by the collaborationist Vichy regime. Kfar Blum 1947 Economy Agriculture (cotton, dairy, fruit) and light industry (metal working) have formed the primary economic basis for the kibbutz. In recent years this has been supplemented increasingly by tourism. Kfar Blum's location near the Jordan River at the foot of Mount Hermon has made it a center for outdoor recreational activities including walking, hiking, kayaking, rafting and bird watching. Education and culture Leon Blum memorial in kibbutz Kfar Blum The kibbutz has a regional school, a sports arena and a hotel. It was also home to Hapoel Galil Elyon, a top division basketball team, which in 1993 became the first club from outside Tel Aviv to win the championship. Between 1969 and 1993, Kfar Blum was home to 24 years of the American Class, an academic-year-long program for an annual cohort of 15 to 30 U.S. and Canadian 10th-graders. Founded by Kfar Blum member Pinchas Rimon, American Class participants lived with kibbutz teenagers, held kibbutz jobs, were ‚Äúadopted‚Äù into kibbutz families, and attended school in a classroom of the Emek Hahula High School. Since 1985 Kfar Blum has been the site of the annual Voice of Music Festival in Upper Galilee, also referred to as the Kfar Blum Festival, a chamber music festival that is held in mid-summer.

The 1980 group should not be confused with Robert Fripp's first semi-professional band in the 1960s, which had the same name. Fripp referred to the 1980 band as \\"a second-division touring new wave instrumental dance band\\". The Trouser Press Record Guide described the League of Gentlemen's music as typically taking \\"a simple medium-to-fast backbeat over which Fripp and Andrews locked horns, with melodic development emerging slowly, surely, subtly.\\" Trouser Press also suggests that the League's foray into dance oriented rock was a precursor to Fripp's reformed King Crimson in the early 1980s. The band toured extensively in Europe and North America throughout 1980. There are 77 specific tour dates detailed in the sleevenotes on the album The League of Gentlemen. Missing from this list are four (possibly warm-up) gigs at the 14th Century Hunting Lodge (now Lodge Farm House), outside the grounds of Kingston Lacy near Wimborne Minster, Dorset, England.

He was killed in action in the battle of Hilli, during the Indo-Pakistan War of 1971. He was posthumously awarded the Param Vir Chakra, India's highest award for valour in the face of the enemy. Early life Albert Ekka was born on 27 December 1942, in village Zari, Ranchi, Bihar. His parents were Julius Ekka and Mariam Ekka. Ekka's family belonged to an Adivasi tribe . Hunting was a common sport among the Adivasis, and Ekka was interested in it from his childhood. With his experience of hunting in jungles, he was able to be a better soldier with his skilful use of ground and movements. As he grew, Ekka developed interest for the army, and was enrolled in the Bihar Regiment on 27 December 1962. Military career After the 14th Battalion of the Brigade of the Guards was raised in January 1968, Ekka was transferred to that unit. He saw action in counter-insurgency operations while in the North East. During the preparations anticipation of Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, Ekka was promoted to lance naik.] =Battle of Gangasagar= As the war broke out, 14 Guards was attached to the IV Corps. The capture of Gangasagar, located to the south Akhaura in the Brahmanbaria District, was crucial for the advancement of IV Corps, and 14 Guards was tasked for that. As the operation began, the unit placed itself south of Gangasagar, about from Akhaura railway station, and formed its defences. The high ground around the railway station was their main defence, followed by anti-tank and anti-personnel mines. During a patrol, Pakistani troops were found moving on the railway tracks. Soon two companies of the battalion attacked the enemy positions along the track.

History During the Second Sino-Japanese War in the 1930s, the Japanese soon found that the 7.7mm cartridge being fired by their Type 92 heavy machine gun in China was superior to the 6.5√ó50mm cartridge of the Type 38 rifle, necessitating the development of a new weapon to replace the outclassed Type 38.Honeycutt and Anthony p. 84 The Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) developed the Type 99 based on the Type 38 rifle but with a caliber of 7.7mm. The Type 99 was produced at nine different arsenals. Seven arsenals were located in Japan, with the other two located at Mukden in Manchukuo and Jinsen in Korea. The IJA had intended to completely replace the Type 38 with the Type 99 by the end of the war. However, the outbreak of the Pacific war never allowed the army to completely replace the Type 38 and so the IJA used both rifles during the war. As the war progressed, more and more cost saving steps were introduced in order to speed up production. Late war rifles are often called \\"Last Ditch\\" or \\"Substitute Standard\\" due to their crudeness of finish. They are generally as crude as the 1945 dated Mauser K98k of Germany, or worse. The Type 99 was produced in four versions, the regular issue Type 99 Short Rifle, the Type 99 Long Rifle (a limited production variant), the take-down Type 2 Paratroop Rifle, and the Type 99 Sniper Rifle. The standard rifle also came with a wire monopod and an anti-aircraft sighting device. The Type 99 was the first mass-produced infantry rifle to have a chrome lined bore to ease cleaning. All of these features were abandoned by mid-war. =Use by other countries= During the Korean War, approximately 126,500 short and 6,650 long Type 99 Rifles were re-chambered under American supervision at the Tokyo arsenal to fire the then-standard .30-06 Springfield cartridge. Apparently intended for the South Korean \\"gendarmerie\\", few rifles appear to have been issued at the end of the war in 1953. These rifles were fitted with a lengthened magazine well and had a small notch cut in the top of the receiver to accommodate the .30-06 round's 1/3 inch greater length. Accuracy suffered, due to the difference in cartridges, rifling rate and characteristics, but they were nonetheless functional. Conversions to both .30-06 and 7.62 NATO as well 7.62 Russian have also been performed by civilians, often along with sporterising modifications. After 1946, the Republic of China re-chambered large numbers of Type 99 rifles to fire the 8√ó57 IS cartridge. Indonesian forces used a large number of Type 99 rifles in the fighting against the Dutch during the Indonesian National Revolution (1945‚Äì1949), although late Japanese production was less reliable. Sniper rifles were also used. The Royal Thai Army received Japanese rifles of all types after 1945 and converted some short Type 99 rifles to fire the U.S. .30-06 cartridge during the early 1950s. =Nomenclature= In the West, Japanese equipment is commonly referred to as \\"Type XX\\", rather than \\"Model XX\\". In the case of a firearm, \\"Model\\" is a more accurate interpretation of the SHIKI (Âºè) character, but the word \\"Type\\" has become well-established by collectors for decades. Design The flip-up anti-aircraft rear sights of a Type 99 rifle. The calipers on the sides are to determine the speed of the targeted aircraft. To gain the superior hitting power of the larger 7.7mm cartridge, several caliber 6.5mm Type 38 rifles were modified for the new round. Although the tests proved satisfactory, the army decided that the added recoil and larger chambering for the 7.7mm cartridge would require an entirely new rifle for the cartridge. It utilized a cock-on-closing action and an unusual safety mechanism, operated by pressing in the large knurled disk at the rear of the bolt with the palm of the hand and rotating it in a 1/8 clockwise turn, which is often misunderstood by Western shooters who are used to the Mauser's thumb lever safety. It featured a quick-release bolt and antiaircraft sights, as well as a sliding bolt cover and monopod. As a bolt- action rifle, the Type 99 was a very solid weapon, but as with all manually operated rifles used during World War II, they were in most close combat situations outclassed by semi-automatic rifles and submachine guns. The Type 99 is one of the strongest military bolt action rifles ever made,Hatcher, P. 206, 210 but many late-war (\\"last ditch\\") rifles used lower quality parts, and a complete lack of finish, as well as shortcuts taken to ease production. The \\"last ditch\\" rifles are usually distinguished by their crudeness: poorly finished stock, wood buttplate, very obvious tooling marks in the metal, rudimentary sights and an unfinished bolt knob and handle. Unlike its predecessors, however, a disadvantage of the Type 99 was its increased recoil due to the lighter weight combined with a heavier cartridge. In some cases, these rifles may actually be training rifles intended for firing cartridges with a wood projectile only. The training rifles were made of mild steel and were never intended for ball ammunition. It is possible that reports of Type 99 rifles blowing up were simply the results of soldiers testing captured weapons. Unaware that they were using drill rifles, they fired ball ammunition in them with poor results and possible injuries. It is possible that this may have unjustly led to the Arisaka having a reputation (at least for the last ditch rifles) for being of poor construction. The Type 99 can be fitted with a Type 30 bayonet. The Type 30 bayonet had a very long, slender blade, and was grooved to reduce weight. The early models featured a hooked quillion. These bayonets attached to a lug under the barrel and were further stabilized by a loop that fit around the muzzle. Unmounted, it handled like a machete. Variants Type 99 long rifle The initial production rifle of the Type 99. Made only by Nagoya Arsenal and Toyo Kogyo under Kokura Arsenal supervision. Only about 38,000 were produced, 8,000 at Nagoya and 30,000 at Toyo Kogyo between summer of 1940 and spring of 1941 when production was switched to the much more common new Type 99 short rifle of which millions were made. Like the early Type 99 short rifles, these rifles were made with a monopod, anti- aircraft lead arms on the rear sight and a dust cover.Voigt, p.18-20 Gallery Image:Arisaka Type 99 full.jpgFull view of a late war Type 99 Image:Arisaka Type 99 butt.jpgButtstock of the Type 99 Image:Arisaka Type 99 boltlocked.jpgLocked Type 99 bolt Image:Arisaka Type 99 boltunlocked.jpgUnlocked Type 99 bolt Image:Arisaka Type 99 bolt.jpgClose-up of the Type 99 bolt Image:Arisaka Type 99 rifling.jpgBarrel of the Type 99 showing rifling Image:Arisaka Type 99 bayonet.jpgType 30 bayonet Image:Arisaka Type 99 bayonet attached.jpgType 99 with Type 30 bayonet attached Image:Type 99 Full View 2.JPGFull view of an early Type 99 short rifle Image:Type 99 Full View 1.JPGFull view of an early Type 99 short rifle Image:Type 99 AA Sights Up.JPGFlip-up anti-aircraft sights on Type 99 Image:Type 99 AA Sights Down.JPGFlip-up anti-aircraft sights on Type 99, in the down position.

In many cases, the imperial chrysanthemum atop the receiver has been defaced by the surrendering Japanese in order to preserve the Emperor's honor: the mark indicated that the rifle was the Emperor's personal property. Rifles with an intact chrysanthemum often bring a premium on the collector market, sometimes almost double the price for a like model defaced rifle. Many have been rechambered to more common calibers due to the relative scarcity of factory 7.7√ó58mm Arisaka; it is particularly suitable for this due to its robust action.

It was the first home of the Art Museum of Toronto. Today, it is part of the Art Gallery of Ontario. The structure was built in 1817, making it the 12th oldest surviving building in Toronto and the oldest remaining brick house. It was built for D'Arcy Boulton (1785‚Äì1846), one of the town's leading citizens and part of the powerful Boulton family that played an important role in the Family Compact. Originally, it was considerably west of the city, but over time, the city grew and Boulton sold his considerable land holdings surrounding the manor at great profit. The house was inherited by D'Arcy's son and Toronto mayor, William Henry Boulton. When he died in 1874, the house passed to his widow, Hariette Boulton. She remarried the prominent scholar Goldwin Smith, and the couple lived in The Grange for the rest of their lives. Upon Goldwin's Smith's death in 1910, the couple bequeathed the building to the Art Museum of Toronto (now known as the Art Gallery of Ontario) and The Grange became the new home of the gallery. The building also served as the first home of the Ontario College of Art and Design, now OCAD University. Since the early 20th century, the Art Gallery of Ontario has been expanded a number of times and the original manor makes up only a small part of the structure. The expanse of lawn to the south of the building, what is left of the grounds, is operated by the city as Grange Park. Also on the old grounds is St. George Church, which was founded by the Boultons and which burned down in 1956. Only the tower and original Sunday school building remain. In 1970, The Grange was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in recognition of the house's significance to the history of Toronto.The Grange, Directory of Designations of National Historic Significance of CanadaThe Grange, National Register of Historic Places History =Early history (1817‚Äì1910)= The Grange was built in 1817 as the home of D'Arcy Boulton (1785‚Äì1846; son of G. D'Arcy Boulton), his wife, Sarah Anne, and their eight children. It was located on 100 acres (40 ha) of land that extended from Queen Street in the south to Bloor Street in the north and from Beverley Street east to McCaul Street. The north section of the property was sold to Bishop Strachan in 1828, to be used for the establishment of King‚Äôs College, an Anglican university. Property to the south was donated in the 1830s and 1840s for St. George the Martyr Church and St. Patrick's Market, both still in existence. Sarah Anne Robinson was born in Lower Canada in 1789 to a loyalist family who had previously moved north from Virginia after the American Revolution. D‚ÄôArcy Boulton, in contrast, immigrated to Canada in 1797 when he was 12 years old. The two met through Sara Anne‚Äôs older brother Peter Robinson and settled at The Grange (so named for the Boulton family estate in Lincolnshire, England) in 1817. Sarah Anne quickly established herself as a superior hostess and The Grange became a central site for the social and political happenings of early Toronto. Over the course of their lives, the Boultons had eight children. D‚ÄôArcy Boulton made his living running a dry good store and obtaining three governments posts. He died in 1846 after a rough decade of family deaths, a cholera epidemic and financial strain. When D‚ÄôArcy died, the house was left to Sarah Anne. She put the house and the land around it in trust for her daughter-in-law, Harriette, as a marriage settlement. Thus, the house was under Harriette‚Äôs control and it was Harriette who bequeathed the house to the Art Museum of Toronto. The head of the household was now his eldest son, William Henry Boulton. Goldwin Smith (centre foreground) at The Grange with friends. Smith lived on the property in the late 19th century Over the course of his life William was mayor of Toronto three times in 1845, 1846, 1847 and was a member of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada. In 1846, William married Harriette Mann Dixon from Boston, yet the couple never had any children. William, however, was fond of gambling and Harriette and her mother- in-law, Sarah Anne, spent much time trying to keep The Grange in Boulton hands. William died in 1874, leaving Harriette as the sole owner of The Grange. In 1875, Harriette married Goldwin Smith, British scholar and political writer. Goldwin Smith was once regius professor of history at Oxford University and personal tutor to the Prince of Wales. However, he decided to settle in Toronto in 1871. Smith was a proud supporter of the arts in Toronto and founded journals and encouraged young artists to paint Canadian subjects. The couple lived happily in The Grange until their deaths in 1909 (Harriette) and 1910 (Goldwin). =Re-purposing into an art gallery (1911‚Äìpresent)= The Grange in 1910, shortly before it was transformed into an art museum By the turn of the 20th century, it was decided that Toronto should have an art gallery, much like many other major cities at the time. By 1900, local artist George Reid was the president of the Ontario Society of Artists and was pushing for the creation of an art gallery. Between Reid and Edmund Walker (prominent banker and champion of the arts), a campaign was established to raise money for the gallery scheme. In 1902, the Smiths joined the cause and decided to bequeath The Grange as the first location of the Art Museum of Toronto. It wasn‚Äôt until 1913 that the museum held its first exhibition, composed of Smith‚Äôs own collection. By 1966, The Art Museum of Toronto was renamed the Art Gallery of Ontario (AGO) and The Grange now sits on the south side of the larger AGO building. From the early days of the Art Museum of Toronto until the restoration of the 1960s, The Grange underwent a variety of changes, including electrification and the inclusion of an apartment for a live-in caretaker. In 1918 and 1926 respectively, additional gallery wings were added to the AGO and several rooms in The Grange were used as staff offices. A tea room was also established in the drawing room and breakfast parlour. By the 1960s, the AGO was once again expanding, therefore forging a new path for The Grange. This was a time in Ontario of increased interest in heritage preservation and so the Junior Women's Committee raised $650 000 for a restoration project. This money was used to restore The Grange to how it would have looked in 1835. In 1970, The Grange was named a National Historic Site of Canada. Designated by the City of Toronto under the Ontario Heritage Act by By-law 130-91317 Dundas Street West, City of Toronto Inventory of Heritage Properties Today, The Grange houses the Norma Ridley Members‚Äô Lounge and exhibit spaces. While it is no longer furnished as a historic house depicting the 1830s, it retains its historic roots and architectural integrity. Visitors to the AGO are free to enjoy The Grange and explore the exhibits, take a tour, and speak to a volunteer about The Grange history. Architecture The Art Gallery of Ontario's five-storey main building situated behind The Grange, a two-storey Georgian-styled residence The original house, designed by an unknown architect, was two storeys high, 60 by 40 feet (18 m √ó 12 m) in area, with a low hipped roof containing a circular window. It is likely that the bricks were made on the property from the heavily clayed soil. The windows are double-hung with brick lintels and louvered wooden shutters. They are 12-over-12 sash on the main floor and 8-over-8 sash on the second. The front door has a moulded reveal and a semi- circular fanlight, with separate sidelights. Originally, the gate of the building extended to Queen Street, however the gates have been crowded back to the head of John Street. As was the custom at the time, The Grange was built in the middle of a hundred-acre park lot. It received the name \\"The Grange\\" after a family estate in England. Reflecting a sense of Georgian balance, the front door opened onto a central hall with the dining room on the left and the drawing room on the right. At the back of the house and on the second floor were bedrooms for the family. There were also four large rooms in the attic, probably for the servants. The kitchen, food storage areas and scullery were in the basement. The property saw two major expansions, with the first series of expansions occurring in the 1840s. Several additions were made to the house, possibly because there had been a fire (this is difficult to confirm). These changes included the enlargement of the drawing room; the elimination of three bedrooms to create a large second-floor assembly room; and an addition on the west end to house an office. William Boulton, who was mayor of Toronto four times and a Member of Parliament, might have needed such a space. The front hall was also enlarged and a new central staircase installed. The painted glass window depicting the family crest was also added. This crest is a visual play on the name Boulton, as it shows a barrel pierced by an arrow, or bolt, with a hogshead of wine or tun. The family motto ‚Äî \\"Dux vitae ratio\\" (\\"The guide to life is reason\\") ‚Äî rests below the crest, always reminding the Boultons of their British ancestry.[Charlotte Gray. House Guests. Art Gallery of Ontario, 2001] William, the secretary of the Turf Club, built St. Leger Race Course to the north. The west wing of The Grange were built in the 1840s and 1885 Following the marriage of Harriette Boulton to her second husband, Goldwin Smith, the property was expanded again in 1885. additions to the house were undertaken. Smith was a scholar and a large library was added to the west of the house. The Georgian-style staircase was replaced with an angular Victorian-style oak stair that skirted the painted window. The wooden front porch was replaced with a stone version. =Gardens= Originally, there was a path running up to the front steps, with an oval drive around the front lawn. The house stood on raised ground with terraces, as it does today. Around it was a mix of open spaces, stands of trees and flower gardens. Behind the house were vegetable and fruit gardens and, farther north, an orchard. The front lawn of The Grange, now known as the Grange Park, was central to Grange activities. This was the site for many garden parties, church school picnics and even a royal visit. Several images of The Grange show a domed glass conservatory on the east side of the house, which would have been filled with plants readily available from catalogues. One 1827 catalogue advertised 79 varieties of apple among other fruit and ornamental trees, as well as a wide variety of shrubs, flowers and greenhouse plants. We know that there was an orchard house on the property growing peaches, nectarines and grapes. William Boulton won prizes at the 1844 Toronto Horticultural Society Show for geraniums, roses, greenhouse plants and pansies. The gardener, John Gray, named a geranium he developed Pelargonium boultonianum after the Boultons. With the sale of the southern part of the property in the mid-19th century, a new entrance to The Grange was created, which included a lodge ‚Äî home to William Chin, the butler, and his family. Other buildings included a stable, a root house, a tool house and a drive shed. Later in the century, cottages for married servants were also erected.

The resultant ‚ÄúType 11 light machine gun‚Äù (named after the 11th year of the reign of Emperor Taish≈ç, or 1922) was the first light machine gun to be mass-produced in Japan and the oldest Japanese light machine gun design to see service in the Pacific War. It was superseded by the Type 96 light machine gun in 1936. Design details The Type 11 with accessories A Type 11 light machine gun in Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution, Beijing The Type 11 light machine gun was a design by famed arms designer Kijir≈ç Nambu, based on a modification of the French Hotchkiss M1909 Ben√©t‚ÄìMerci√© machine gun. It was an air-cooled, gas- operated design, using the same 6.5√ó50mm Arisaka cartridges as the Type 38 infantry rifle. TM-E 30‚Äì480 (1945) A feature of the Type 11 machine gun is its detachable hopper; it can be refilled while attached and does not require removal during operation. Instead of a belt or box magazine, the Type 11 was designed to hold up to six of the same cartridge clips used on the Type 38 rifle. The five-round clips were stacked lying flat above the receiver, secured by a spring arm, and the rounds were stripped from the lowest clip one at a time, with the empty clip thrown clear and the next clip automatically falling into place as the gun was fired. The system had the advantage that any squad member could supply ammunition and that the hopper could be replenished at any time. The relatively short barrel (17.5 inches) produced excessive flash with standard ammunition (initially intended for Type 38 rifles with barrel more than a foot longer). A new load was introduced for this reason, which had a slightly lower muzzle velocity (100fps less), but burned much more completely in the Type 11 short barrel and produced much less flash as a result. This new round was called the 6.5√ó50mm Arisaka genso round, the cartons identified by a circled red \\"G\\". The inherent disadvantage of the hopper was that the open feeder box allowed dust and grit to enter the gun, which was liable to jam in muddy or dirty conditions due to issues with poor dimensional tolerances, which gave the weapon a bad reputation with Japanese troops.Meyer, The Rise and Fall of Imperial Japan. pg.55 Another issue was that the weight of the rifle cartridges in the side-mounted hopper unbalanced the weapon when fully loaded. To compensate, the buttstock was designed in a way that it bent to the right, leading to the Chinese nickname for the weapon \\"bent buttstock\\" (). Reloading the weapon during an assault charge proved impossible due to the clip feeding system. Variants Type 89 \\"flexible\\" ‚Äì two Type 11 actions mounted on a flexible mounting for anti-aircraft use and as a rear-defense aerial gun. The machine gun was chambered for the 7.7x58mmSR Type 89 cartridge. It was equipped with a metallic Y-shaped stock and two spade grips, the barrels had no cooling fins. It was fed from two 45-round quadrant-shaped pan magazines (each magazine had a place for nine five-round stripper clips). The double-barrelled machine gun weighted about 28 kg and had a rate of fire of around 1,400 rpm. Type 91 ‚Äì was a modified Type 11 for use on tanks and armoured vehicles. The machine gun was equipped with an angled pistol grip, the stock and bipod were removed. Additionally, the machine gun was equipped with two brackets (on the right side) for mounting a 1.5x30 scope manufactured by Tomioka Kogaku. Te-4 ‚Äì a modified Type 11 which was designed to replace the Type 89 \\"flexible\\" due to the excessive weight of the latter. It used a different flexible mounting, had a shorter wooden stock and a straight pistol grip with an enlarged trigger guard, the barrel had no cooling fins. It was chambered for the 7.7x58mmSR Type 89 cartridge and fed from 70-round pan magazine. It is uncertain whether the Te-4 was made by splitting the Type 89 \\"flexible\\" or was a direct derivative of Type 11. Combat record IJN Special Naval Landing Forces armed with the Type 11 during the Battle of Shanghai A Type 11 light machine gun captured by the Chinese Army and used against the IJA soldiers. The Type 11 came into active service in 1922, and some 29,000 were produced by the time production stopped in 1941. It was the primary Japanese light machine gun through the Manchurian Incident and in the early stages of the Second Sino-Japanese War. Although superseded by the Type 96 light machine gun in production in 1936, it remained in service with front-line combat through the end of World War II. Many were captured by the Chinese and were used against the Japanese. Manchukuo Imperial Army replaced its ex-Chinese ZB vz. 30s with Type 11s in 1936. Both sides also used Type 11 machine guns during the Chinese Civil War and North Korea used Type 11 and Type 91 during the Korean War. The Viet Minh also used the Type 11 during the First Indochina War, as did the Viet Cong during the Vietnam War.

The earlier Type 11 light machine gun was a lightweight machine gun, which could be easily transportable by an infantry squad into combat. However, the open hopper design of the Type 11 allowed dust and grit to enter into the gun, which was liable to jam in muddy or dirty conditions due to issues with poor dimensional tolerances. This gave the weapon a bad reputation with Japanese troops, and led to calls for its redesign.Meyer, The Rise and Fall of Imperial Japan. p. 55 The Army's Kokura Arsenal tested the Czech ZB vz. 26 machine gun, samples of which had been captured from the National Revolutionary Army of the Republic of China, and (after borrowing certain elements) issued a new design, designated the Type 96 light machine gun, in 1936. The gun was produced at Kokura, Nagoya Arsenal and Mukden between 1936 and 1943, with a total production run of about 41,000. JapaneseWeapons.net While the Japanese design was completely different internally, it did resemble the ZB vz. 26 in its basic layout using the top feed magazine and a bipod mount. The similar looking Type 97 heavy tank machine gun however was a true license built copy of the ZB design firing the heavier 7.7x58mm Arisaka cartridge; it was mounted in the tanks of the Japanese Army.  Design  Marines with a captured Type 96 Type 96 light machine gun with Type 99 (1939) armor shield, size 12 in.x16 in. The Type 96 light machine gun was almost identical in construction to the Type 11 in that it was an air-cooled, gas-operated design based on the French Hotchkiss M1909 machine gun. As with the Type 11, it continued to use the same 6.5x50mm Arisaka cartridges as the Type 38 rifle infantry rifle, TM-E 30-480 (1945) although the more powerful 7.7x58mm Arisaka round had already been adopted and was starting to enter into service with front line combat units. Due to its visual resemblance to the Bren they are often mistakenly regarded as clones. The major difference from the Type 11 was the top-mounted curved detachable box magazine holding 30 rounds, which somewhat increased reliability and lessened the weight of the gun. The finned gun barrel could also be rapidly changed to avoid overheating. The Type 96 had a blade front sight and a leaf rear sight, with graduations from 200 to 1,500 meters, with windage adjustment. A 2.5X telescopic sight with a 10 degree field of view could be attached at the right side of the gun. The Type 96 also had a folding bipod attached to the gas block, and could be fitted with the standard infantry bayonet, which could be attached to the gas block below the barrel, making it, alongside the later Type 99 the only machine gun used in the Second World War that a bayonet could be attached to. The gun had no select-fire capability. Modern Firearms Despite the fact it could cause stoppages, designer Kijiro Nambu did nothing to address the dimensional tolerance issue between the bolt and barrel, which would lead to feed failure if casings got stuck in the chamber. In order to ensure reliable feeding (theoretically), Nambu resorted to oiling the cartridges via an oil pump in the magazine loader. In practice, this tended to worsen the problem instead, as the oiled cartridges tended to become coated with dust and sand.Morse, Japanese Small Arms of WW2; Light Machine Guns Models 11, 96, 99 97 & 92 This feature and its inherent faults were dropped with the introduction of the Type 99 light machine gun.  Combat record  The Type 96 came into active service in 1936 and was intended to replace the older Type 11; however the Type 11 had already been produced in large quantities, and both weapons remained in service until the end of the war. The Type 96 was regarded as rugged and reliable, but its 6.5 mm bullets lacked penetration against cover, especially in comparison to other rifle rounds of the day such as the American .30-06 Springfield and the design was supplanted by the more powerful Type 99 light machine gun with the larger 7.7 mm bullet in 1937. After World War II, it was used by Indonesian forces during the Indonesian National Revolution against Dutch forces notably during the attack on Jogjakarta 1949. It was used by the Viet Minh and the North Vietnamese forces during the First and Second Indochina Wars. Users * Machine Guns: An Illustrated History of Their Impact by James H.

More broadly, they can also include musical ensembles of other federal and state uniformed services, including the Public Health Service and NOAA Corps, the state defense forces, and the senior military colleges. During the colonial period, most British army units posted in the area that would become the United States had bands attached. The first recorded instance of a local American military band was in 1653 in the New Hampshire militia. The oldest extant United States military band is the United States Marine Corps Band, formed in 1798 and known by the moniker \\"The President's Own\\". The U.S. armed forces field eleven ensembles and more than 100 smaller, active-duty and reserve bands. Bands provide martial music during official events including state arrivals, military funerals, ship commissioning, and change of command and promotion ceremonies; they conduct public performances in support of military public relations and recruitment activities such as street parades and concerts; and they provide popular music groups to entertain deployed military personnel. Most bands of the U.S. armed forces reconfigure into combat units during wartime during which they have non-musical responsibilities, including guarding prisoners of war and defending command centers. Unlike Canada, the United Kingdom, and some other nations, the United States federal armed forces do not maintain any \\"voluntary bands\\", or bands composed of unpaid civilian musicians who dress in military uniforms. All U.S. military bands are composed of regularly enlisted or commissioned military personnel. One exception to this is the United States Coast Guard Pipe Band, which is drawn from the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary.  History  = Before independence = For more than 100 years, American martial music was based around the fife. For hundreds of years, military forces have used music to signal their troops. Evidence of the attachment of musicians to military units operating in what would become the United States dates to 1633, when colonial Virginia militia employed drummers to beat marching cadences during drills and maneuvers. According to research by the U.S. Armed Forces School of Music, the first complete military band in the American colonies was organized in New Hampshire in 1653 with an instrumentation of 15 oboes and two drums. The exposure of Americans to martial music increased with the growth of the number of British Army units being rotated through the colonies; most British infantry regiments had military musicians attached, consisting of both field music units that sounded signals during combat, as well as \\"Bands of Musick\\" that performed for special and ceremonial occasions. = War for independence = Early American military music was centered around the fife, with brass instruments only slowly adopted. At the outset of the American Revolution, United States military units primarily relied on fife and drum corps for musical support. Americans were first introduced to the bugle horn (forerunner to the modern bugle) during the Battle of Harlem Heights, when British infantry used the instrument, causing Joseph Reed to later recall, \\"the enemy appeared in open view, and sounded their bugles in a most insulting manner, as is usual after a fox chase. I never felt such a sensation before‚Äîit seemed to crown our disgrace.\\" Some American cavalry units adopted bugle horns during the war, however, a shortage of brass in the Thirteen Colonies largely limited use of the instrument to the opposing British and German forces, with American troops continuing to rely heavily on fifes, drums, and even ‚Äì at the Battle of Saratoga ‚Äì turkey calls. Among the most noted American military musicians during the revolutionary period was Barzillai Lew whose fifing during the bloody Battle of Bunker Hill has been credited with keeping troop morale high. The end of the revolution came \\"the end of everything military\\" in the United States and it was not until 1798, with the establishment of the U.S. Marine Corps, that military music returned in an organized fashion. In the enabling legislation authorizing the creation of the Marines, Congress authorized the funding of a Drum-Major, Fife Major and 32 musicians. This band, the U.S. Marine Band, as of 2020 remains the oldest extant military music organization in the United States and, indeed, the oldest professional musical ensemble in that nation. The establishment of regular U.S. armed forces brought with it a standardization of uniforms. Federal soldiers and Marines wore a variety of uniforms based around the basic color blue with the exception of bandsmen whose uniforms were patterned in red to allow them to be more easily identifiable to field commanders who would need them to signal his orders to troops. The use of red in musician's uniforms is maintained to varying degrees by U.S. military bands today, as seen in the uniforms of the U.S. Marine Corps Band, the U.S. Marine Drum and Bugle Corps, the Old Guard Fife and Drum Corps of the 3rd Infantry Regiment, and in the peaked hats of the U.S. Army Band which are colored red in contrast to the standard U.S. Army blue design. The modern bugle was first introduced to American military units around the time of the War of 1812. During that conflict, only the Rifle Regiment was authorized to use the bugle. All other American forces were required to continue using the traditional American fife. Gradually, however, bugles became more widely adopted by the United States military. An early iteration of the U.S. Marine Band's bearskin helmet, shown in the 1859 uniform regulations In 1855 United States Marine Band director Francesco Scala adopted the bearskin helmet for that band's drum-major in emulation of European trends. This transition occurred as the band was reorganizing itself from a traditional American fife and drum corps into its modern incarnation and the style later became popular headgear used by many military band drum-majors in the United States. (A shortage of bearskins in the late 1880s caused the price of the hats to skyrocket, with the New York Times then reporting their use might be phased out entirely. \\"It can readily be seen what a price has to be paid for keeping up a custom which is rather old, it is true, but is practically a useless one save for the purpose of military display,\\" the newspaper opined.) = Civil War = The regimental band of the 114th Pennsylvania Infantry in zouave uniform, pictured in 1864 Band for the 10th Veteran Reserve Corps during the American Civil War At the time of the American Civil War, U.S. Army bands had a normal strength of 24 musicians for infantry units, and 16 for cavalry. With the mobilization of the Union Army, transition to total war, and decreasing importance of bands in signaling troops, the United States Department of War in 1861 considered cutting military bands entirely, estimated a potential cost savings of $5 million. The proposal was shelved in the face of opposition from officers and soldiers, however, a trimming of bandsmen occurred by eliminating some regimental ensembles in favor of brigade-level bands. Nonetheless, a survey in October 1861 found that 75-percent of Union regiments had a band and, by December of that year, the Union Army had 28,000 musicians in 618 bands. Bandsmen were also, for the first time, tasked with performing combat duties in addition to musical performance, frequently as stretcher-bearers and field hospital orderlies. Musicians were often given special privileges. Union general Phillip Sheridan gave his cavalry bands the best horses and special uniforms, believing \\"music has done its share, and more than its share, in winning this war\\".Lanning pp. 243‚Äì244 In addition to ceremonial and maneuver music, bands during this period also began performing concerts for troops with the popular music of the day, many regimental bands having formerly been civilian bands that enlisted en masse at the outbreak of hostilities. John Partridge, a soldier in the 24th Massachusetts Volunteer Regiment, recorded in a letter home the value the men in his unit placed on the regimental band, formerly a civilian orchestra from Boston led by Patrick Gilmore: John Philip Sousa, pictured here in the 1880s as commander of the U.S. Marine Band, is credited as America's greatest composer of martial music. = March music era (1870 to 1900) = In the post-war era, aided by the large body of work being created by prolific American composers such as John Philip Sousa, Henry Filmore and Edwin Eugene Bagley, American military and military-like bands became known for performing a unique style of quick-tempo marches with thundering brass and heavy percussion. One music critic, writing about the Boston Jubilee of 1872, contrasted the \\"velvety smoothness\\" of the invited Band of the Grenadier Guards to the follow-up performance orchestrated by U.S. Army bandmaster- general Patrick Gilmore which involved \\"a heterogeneous choir of nearly twenty thousand, an orchestra of about a thousand instrumentalists of decidedly mixed abilities, an organ blown by steam power ... a drum of the most preposterous magnitude, and a few batteries of artillery.\\" Beginning in the 1880s, the United States Army Corps of Engineers maintained a band at the U.S. Army Engineer School (then the Engineers School at Willets Point, New York). Then, it was led by Julius Hamper, a Swiss immigrant and conductor. It was dissolved in the early 1900s after over 20 years of service in Washington D.C.https://www.usace.army.mil/About/History/Exhibits/Band-Koeber-Collection/ = 20th century to present = The mounted band of the 2nd U.S. Cavalry leads the parade at the 1902 encampment of the Grand Army of the Republic. By the early 1900s military bands were being established in the far-flung reaches of the American colonial empire. Most notable among them was the Philippine Constabulary Band under the direction of Walter Loving. The group, described by Army and Navy Life as \\"one of the finest of all military bands in the world,\\" and credited with John Philip Sousa as being equal in quality to the U.S. Marine Band, led the 1909 U.S. presidential inauguration parade, the first time a band other than \\"The President's Own\\" had done so. During World War I, the U.S. armed forces experienced a great influx of professional civilian musicians resulting, in part, from the mobilization of 27 African- American regiments to augment the U.S. Army's existing four black regiments. The regimental bands of these newly formed units were frequently led by black blues and jazz musicians experienced performing in the clubs of New York and Chicago. Among them was James Reese Europe, whose 369th Regiment band (the \\"Harlem Hellfighters Band\\") is credited with introducing jazz to Europe. Regimental bands during this time varied greatly in size and quality and \\"intensive recruiting by an ambitious colonel with a band fund and an able conductor might coax a significant number of voluntary enlistments and result in a flexible, professional-quality ensemble.\\" A U.S. Army band leads the entrance of American troops into Verdun, France in 1944. During World War II, the Women's Army Corps (WAC) formed female military bands to perform for departing and arriving troops, on training bases in the U.S., and as part of war bond drives, including the 404th Armed Service Forces Band, the only all- black all-female band in U.S. military history. In 1949 the U.S. Air Force established the USAF Drum and Bugle Corps and a USAF Pipe Band. The former group continued until it was eliminated in 1961 as a cost-cutting measure. The USAF Pipe Band was deactivated nine years later, in 1970. By the 20th century military music had effectively ceased to be an integral part of combat operations with the existence of military bands becoming a function of public duties and troop morale and welfare. Occasional exceptions existed, however. One later example of the use of a band in combat occurred during the Vietnam War when U.S. Army Major-General John Hay ordered the 1st Infantry Division band to march down a road held by the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) while playing the \\"Colonel Bogey March\\". NVA forces were, reportedly, so confused by the impromptu parade that they withdrew from the area, allowing American infantry to seize the road without opposition. A U.S. Army bugler performs \\"Taps\\" at Arlington National Cemetery. In 1992 Senator Sam Nunn ‚Äì fighting to stop closures of U.S. military bases in his home state as part of the peace dividend ‚Äì instead suggested elimination of military bands that support the U.S. Military Academy, U.S. Naval Academy, and U.S. Air Force Academy. Nunn said that cadets and midshipmen should volunteer to form their own bands instead, which would save the U.S. up to $10 million. Representatives of service academies responded by explaining that, due to the unique nature of cadet life relative to student life at civilian universities, it would not be practical for volunteer ensembles to replace the academy bands. The proposal ultimately became stalled in a larger debate about trimming $1 billion from the Strategic Defense Initiative and did not move forward. In 2011 Rep. Betty McCollum, responding to a proposal she opposed that would curb funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, called for 40-percent of military band budgets to be slashed. McCollum's suggestion was decried by the Fleet Reserve Association and described by the National Association for Music Education as \\"potentially devastating.\\" The McCollum bill was initially defeated, but reintroduced by the congresswoman a second time, when it narrowly passed with bipartisan support. It was ultimately dropped by the U.S. Senate. In 2012, McCollum again attempted to defund military music programs by reintroducing her amendment. In an effort to preempt further action by McCollum, the U.S. Air Force proactively disbanded the Band of the Air Force Reserve, the Band of the Pacific-Alaska, and the Band of Liberty. At the time of its deactivation, the Band of the Air Force Reserve was the Air Force's oldest musical ensemble, founded in 1941 as the First Air Force Band of the U.S. Army Air Corps. In addition to the three active-duty bands, six of what were then eleven Air National Guard bands were also deactivated. In 2016, U.S. Representative Martha McSally, a Republican from Arizona, introduced an amendment to the defense spending bill to remove $430 million in funding for military bands to eliminate their performing at concerts, parades, dinners and other public events. The amendment passed the House of Representatives on a voice vote and now goes to the Senate. McSally said military bands would still be allowed to play at military funerals and certain ceremonies.House takes aim at military band spending, Associated Press (June 17, 2016).  Customs and traditions  = Eagle drums = Though largely phased out through the rest of the U.S. military, the U.S. Army Band \\"Pershing's Own\\" retains the tradition of the \\"eagle drum\\". During the American Revolution, some military units, lacking heraldic insignia, painted eagles on the facing of their drums (in the British custom a regiment's armorial achievement would be used to decorate drums). This tradition continued after the war, and the decoration of drums with eagles in various poses, often dictated by the tastes of the individual band, continued. By the War of 1812, eagles were required to be painted on a blue ground for infantry units and red for artillery, though the design of eagles remained a largely individual art. Beginning in the 1840s, the U.S. Army attempted to standardize the eagles used on drums and, by the Civil War, stencils were issued to bands to apply the authorized designs, though some flair continued in the finishing and painting of the final product.https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/ammu/hd_ammu.htm With the later establishment of the Army Institute of Heraldry, eagle drums were phased out in favor of drum designs emblazoned with distinctive unit insignia, a return to the British tradition. Today, The U.S. Army Field Band and the U.S. Army Band \\"Pershing's Own\\" use \\"eagle drums\\". Those drums feature a eagle designs created by Gus Moeller known as \\"the Grand Republic\\". = Regalia = The regalia of the U.S. Army Europe Band, showing (left to right) the baldric, mace, and drum wrap Most U.S. military bands are issued a set of regalia, which typically include a baldric worn by the Drum-Major charged with the distinctive unit insignia of the unit to which the band is assigned and, frequently, other symbols as well such as miniature campaign streamers; a chrome mace carried by the Drum-Major and engraved with the unit's name; and a special mural unique to the unit used to wrap the band's drums. In most bands the drum majors often augment their uniforms with bearskin helmets and white leather gauntlets. Others wear the peaked cap instead. = Unit marches = Some U.S. Army units have officially recognized unit marches. Army units with attached bands can adopt a unit march or song at the request of the commanding officer and approval of the United States Army Center of Military History. Units with official marches and songs include the 1st Infantry Division (\\"Big Red One Song\\"), the 3rd Armored Division (\\"Spearhead Song\\"), the 7th Infantry Division (\\"New Arirang March\\"), and the 3rd Infantry Division ( \\"Dogface Soldier\\") among others.  Ensembles  = Premier ensembles = The West Point Band, a premier ensemble, passes in review. A U.S. military premier ensemble is a military band given special status within the U.S. armed forces. Such groups are configured and commanded in a way intended to attract the highest-quality musicians available and competition for enlistment is typically fierce. Unlike non-premier ensembles, which provide musical support to specific military units or commands, premier ensembles exist to promote the U.S. military to the public at-large and to preserve the heritage of American martial music. There are currently eleven such groups. = Unit bands =  Air Force  In addition to its two premier ensembles, the United States Air Force has nine additional active-duty bands: the Air Force Band of the West (at Lackland Air Force Base), the Air Force Heritage of America Band (at Joint Base Langley-Eustis), the Air Force Heartland of America Band (at Offutt Air Force Base), the Air Force Band of Mid-America (at Scott Air Force Base), the Air Force Band of the Golden West (at Travis Air Force Base), the Air Force Band of Flight (at Wright Patterson Air Force Base), the Air Force in Europe Band, the Air Force Band of the Pacific ‚Äì Asia, and the Air Force Band of the Pacific ‚Äì Hawaii (at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam). There are also five Air National Guard bands. The 144th Illinois National Guard Band during the 2011 Chicago Memorial Day Parade  Army  In addition to its four premier ensembles, the U.S. Army fields 25 active-duty bands assigned as unit ensembles to support divisions, corps, and armies. A further 17 part-time U.S. Army Reserve and 44 part-time National Guard bands are also maintained. During combat operations, Army bands reconfigure as light infantry units responsible for reinforcing military police \\"by performing command post security, all- source production section security, and perimeter security for the division EPW central collecting point and EPW holding area.\\"  Coast Guard  A Coast Guard Pipe Band member pictured in 2015 at Air Station North Bend in Oregon Though the Coast Guard does not have additional ensembles other than the U.S. Coast Guard Band, a mixed civilian/military volunteer unit provides regional musical support to Coast Guard bases. The United States Coast Guard Pipe Band is a 70-member pipe and drums band, organized into nine detachments which provide bagpipers and drummers for Coast Guard ship commissioning, change-of-command ceremonies, and funerals. Though a privately maintained and funded organization, it operates with special permission from the U.S. Coast Guard that allows it to use the name \\"Coast Guard.\\" All of its members are, additionally, personnel of the U.S. Coast Guard Reserve and U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary. The band wears uniforms of modified highland dress with kilts in the Coast Guard tartan. The Arizona Band Flotillahttps://patch.com/new- york/northport/us-coast-guard-auxiliary-band-concert of USCG Auxiliary and Coast Guard Academy \\"Windjammers\\" Drum and Bugle Corps are also maintained through private funds.  Marine Corps  In addition to its two premier ensembles, the U.S. Marine Corps also maintains ten, 50-person field bands assigned to the active-duty divisions and air wings. Marine Corps field bands, unlike the United States Marine Band \\"The President's Own\\" and the U.S. Marine Drum and Bugle Corps \\"The Commandant's Own\\", are not mission-exclusive to music. During combat operations, bands are responsible for rear-area defense, reorganizing as the security platoon for the divisional or wing command center. The 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing Band marches down New York's Fifth Avenue during the 2010 Columbus Day Parade. In 2007 the band was deployed to Iraq to provide security at a tactical air control center. The 10 USMC field bands and \\"The Commandant's Own\\" are options for the Marine Corps Musician Enlistment Option Program (MEOP).  Navy  The Navy has nine \\"fleet bands\\" in addition to its two premier ensembles, six of which are located in the Continental United States, the remaining three based in Hawaii, Italy, and Japan. The Navy School of Music at Joint Expeditionary Base Little Creek‚ÄìFort Story is responsible for training Navy and Marine Corps musicians. = Cadet bands = Each of the six senior military colleges, as well as the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, maintain a cadet-staffed band for ceremonial support and performance at athletic events. The band of Norwich University, founded in 1819, is the oldest such group. The Texas A&M; University Fightin' Texas Aggie Band is the largest military band in the United States with more than 400 members. The U.S. Merchant Marine Academy is the only federal service academy not to have a co-located full-time ensemble. The student band, known as \\"George M. Cohan's Own,\\" is the successor to a full-time band that was established at the school during World War II, but later deactivated. Drummers of the Fightin' Texas Aggie Band pictured in 2007 The Naval Academy Pipes and Drums was established in 1996. Several academies maintain pipe bands. The West Point Pipes and Drums, the pipe band of the U.S. Military Academy's Corps of Cadets, was established in 1973, while the U.S. Naval Academy Pipes and Drums was established in 1996 with an endowment from the academy's class of 1961. Both ensembles wear highland dress patterned in their respective service tartans. The VMI Pipe Band, established in 1997 at the Virginia Military Institute, wears modified highland dress consisting of standard VMI cadet uniforms with kilts patterned in the VMI tartan in lieu of trousers. The Citadels Regimental Pipe Band is composed of between 35 and 40 pipers and drummers. In 1991 it, along with the Citadel's Regimental Band, became the first university military band from the United States to participate in the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo. This is also the case in only three out of the currently four US Military Junior Colleges, all of them sporting military band traditions of their own. = Bands of the State Defense Forces and Naval Militias = Of the currently active state defense forces in the country, several bands stand out in active service to serve the ceremonial needs of their states, their governments and legislatures. Among them are the Maryland Defense Force Band, the Georgia State Defense Force Band, 2nd Company Governor's Horse Guards, a mounted band of the New Hampshire Defense Force, and the Band of the Connecticut State Militia. These bands among others maintain the long tradition of military bands within these services, which they share with the wider Armed Forces and the National Guard. = Field music formations (corps of drums and drum and bugle corps) = Only the Old Guard Fife and Drum Corps of the United States Army and the United States Marine Drum and Bugle Corps of the United States Marine Corps maintain the long standing traditions of field music formations within the United States Armed Forces, a tradition currently absent in the SDFs and the National Guard. These formations can be traced back to the long years of British rule, due to the corps of drums made up of fifers and drummers that arrived in what is now the eastern United States together with the infantry regiments of the British Army that arrived in the colonies, together with locally raised militias and local defense regiments later on in the 17th and 18th centuries.

The Type 96 had been introduced into combat service in 1936, and quickly proved to be a versatile weapon to provide covering fire for advancing infantry.Meyer, The Rise and Fall of Imperial Japan. pg.53 Both the earlier Type 11 and current Type 96 light machine guns used the same 6.5x50mmSR Arisaka cartridges as the Type 38 infantry rifle. TM-E 30-480 (1945) Using similar ammunition in both guns simplified supply and had the added advantage that any squad member could supply ammunition for the light machine gun, or vice versa. However, in 1939 the Japanese army was in the process of switching to a larger and more powerful 7.7 mm cartridge which also had no rim, which improved cartridge handling. This more powerful cartridge: 3,136 J energy, compared to the earlier 6.5x50mmSR Arisaka cartridge: 1,966 J energy, required a firearm that had more steel, bigger springs and a heavier bolt to handle the extra forces involved. This required a switch from the Type 38 rifle to the Type 99 Rifle which could handle the more powerful round. Similarly, it was necessary to develop a new version of the reliable Type 96 light machine gun that would also be able to use this new larger caliber; thus the advantages of common ammunition between riflemen and machine gunners could continue. The Type 99 light machine gun was produced at Kokura, Nagoya Arsenal and Mukden with a total production of about 53,000 weapons. JapaneseWeapons.net Design The Type 99 was basically the same design as the Type 96 light machine gun, and had a number of parts in common. However, it dispensed with the oiler and had better primary extraction, increasing reliability over its predecessors. Early models had a mono-pod at the stock and a flash suppressor on the muzzle, which was screwed onto a threaded portion of the gun barrel. A top-mounted curved detachable box magazine held 30 rounds, and the finned gun barrel could be rapidly changed to avoid overheating. The Type 99 had a blade front sight and a leaf rear sight, with graduations from 200 to 1,500 meters, with a wind adjustment. A 2.5X telescopic sight with a 10 degree field of view could be attached at the right side of the gun. These were often issued to the best marksmen of the unit and occasionally employed like a sniper rifle. A standard infantry bayonet could be attached to the gas block below the barrel, but on the battlefield this feature proved inconsequential due to the weight of the gun and the fact that the blade was largely obstructed by the flash hider when it was fixed on the muzzle. Modern Firearms Combat record IJA paratroopers armed with the Type 99 during the Battle of Palembang The Type 99 came into active service in 1939, and was used side-by-side with the older Type 11 and Type 96, as these models had been produced in large quantities and many front line troops continued to use the Type 38 rifles with their 6.5 mm ammunition. All three weapons remained in service until the end of the war.Morse, Japanese Small Arms of WW2; Light Machine Guns Models 11, 96, 99 97 & 92 The Type 99 was used by Communist forces (Chinese and North Korean armies) during the Korean War. It was used by the Viet Minh and the North Vietnamese forces during the First and Second Indochina Wars. Variants A limited production version of the Type 99 was produced for paratroopers. It had a detachable stock and a forward-folding pistol grip. For deployment, the barrel and butt were detached from the gun, the pistol grip and bipod folded, and the entire set packed into a carrying bag.

Archival photograph from before World War II The Ossolineum in Wroc≈Çaw The Ossolineum or the National Ossoli≈Ñski Institute (, ZNiO) is a Polish cultural foundation, publishing house, archival institute and a research centre of national significance founded in 1817. Located in the city of Wroc≈Çaw since 1947, it is the second largest institution of its kind in Poland after the ancient Jagiellonian Library in Krak√≥w. Its publishing arm is the oldest continuous imprint in Polish since the early 19th century.website of the Ossolineum Publishing House Both institutions bear the name of their founder, Polish nobleman, Count J√≥zef Maksymilian Ossoli≈Ñski (1748-1826).Jab≈Ço≈Ñska, W≈Çadys≈Çawa. (1979) \\"Ossoli≈Ñski J√≥zef Kajetan (1748-1826)\\" Polski s≈Çownik biograficzny. Wroc≈Çaw: Polska Akademia Nauk. pp. 416‚Äì421. (in Polish) Although their origin may be traced to the foreign imposed partitions of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth in the 18th century, the institute's actual history dates from 1817 in the former Polish city of Lw√≥w, then known as Lemberg, capital of Galicia, a province of Austria-Hungary (now Lviv in western Ukraine). The institute first opened its doors to the public in 1817. Ossoli≈Ñski's purpose was not only to establish a library with archival and other historical materials and a printing works as a basis for the most important Polish national cultural institution at a time when sovereign Poland did not exist, but also to disseminate information to the Polish population through publishing as a means of maintaining cultural ties. Due to continued existential ordeals provoked by two world wars and other military and political conflicts, such as the ethnic cleansing of the Polish population of the Eastern Borderlands (Kresy) after the annexation of one-third of Poland's landmass in 1939, much of the library and other collections were plundered, scattered or deliberately destroyed. Barely one-third of the artefacts and printed items from the Ossolineum made it to Wroc≈Çaw after World War II. However those items which survived, did so thanks to the heroic dedication of staff, not least, Mieczys≈Çaw Gƒôbarowicz. \\"not only books. The Ossolineum's collections and their custodians\\". Since its westerly relocation in 1947 the Ossolineum's Polish department has become the most extensive in the country as it strives to complete a record of the whole Polish scientific and literary oeuvre. It is the repository of manuscripts of some of the foremost Polish scientists, writers and poets, including: Nicolaus Copernicus' De revolutionibus orbium coelestium, Jan Kochanowski, Adam Mickiewicz, Adam Asnyk, Jan Kasprowicz, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Reymont, Stefan ≈ªeromski, Juliusz S≈Çowacki and in particular, Henryk Sienkiewicz whose chief publisher it has been. The ZNiO departments are: the Ossolineum Library (1816), the Lubomirski Museum (1823), Ossolineum Publishers (1827), the Pan Tadeusz Museum.  History  J√≥zef Ossoli≈Ñski Joseph Bem in 1848 Prince Henryk Lubomirski Mieczys≈Çaw Gƒôbarowicz, the wartime director who outsmarted the invaders Ossoli≈Ñski who was a politician, writer and researcher had already devoted his long life to building and cataloguing an extremely rich library collection, consisting of books, manuscripts, prints and coins. It was only upon mature consideration and after observing developments since the Congress of Vienna that he opted for Lw√≥w, as the most suitable place in which to house his 52 crates of materials having obtained prior approval of the Austrian emperor, Francis I. Thus began his Institute in Lw√≥w (Institut in Lemberg in German). The income from Ossoli≈Ñski's landed properties served for over three decades to finance his acquisitions and collection. The Ossolineum quickly became a celebrated centre for Polish science and culture which not only survived under foreign rule, but throughout the Second Polish Republic in the Interwar period. Until the 1939 invasion of Poland it had combined a library, publishing house, and the Lubomirski Museum. The National Ossoli≈Ñski Institute had been located from its foundation until 1945 in the former convent and church buildings of the Carmelite Order of nuns in Lw√≥w at 2, Ossoli≈Ñscy street, (since renamed vulytsia Stefanyka). After the first partition of Poland and the dissolution of many convents by the Austrian emperor Joseph II, the convent buildings had become a ruin. Their restoration became a project for General J√≥zef Bem who in 1823 merged the Lubomirski Museum (originally founded by Prince Henryk Lubomirski) with the Ossoli≈Ñski Institute. Under Austrian rule, the Ossolineum became a beacon for the Polish independence movement and was one of the most important centres of Polish culture despite foreign rule and the Germanization of its structures. During that time there were many persecutions such as police searches and arrests of employees of the institute. It housed a clandestine Polish printing works in the early 1840s, and had exclusive rights for publishing textbooks under the relative Galician autonomy. During the revolutionary upheaval in 1848, the Ossolineum became a Polish landmark in an otherwise highly ethnically diverse city. = Collections = In accordance with the intentions of its founder, the Ossolineum became one of the most important research centres for history and Polish literature, with one of the largest book collections in Poland as well as a large collection of manuscripts and autographs, including medieval manuscripts and some of the rarest incunabula. There were also individual smaller archives and book collections deposited at the Ossolineum by grand families such as the: Jab≈Çonowski, Pini≈Ñski, Pawlikowski, Skarbek, Balzer, Sapieha, Lubomirski and Mniszech.  Wars of Independence after WWI  After the Russian Revolution and the collapse of Austria-Hungary, before World War I had even ended, Galicia was the scene of further major more localised armed conflict. The Ossolineum was attacked by Ukrainian soldiers during the fighting over the city in 1918. Before the Second World War, the Ossolineum library consisted of 220,000 works, over 6,000 manuscripts, over 9,000 autographs, over 2,000 diplomas and over 3,000 maps (the collection of J.M. Ossoli≈Ñski from the year 1827 included 10,121 works, 19,055 volumes, duplicates, 567 manuscripts in 715 volumes, 133 maps, 1,445 figures). The Ossolineum also kept a complete collection of the published Polish press from the 19th and 20th centuries, the largest in Poland. In his last will, J√≥zef Ossoli≈Ñski had named members of his family as curators and directors to ensure the continuity of the institute and nominated 28 notable Polish families from among whom successors could be chosen in the event his own family died out.Adolf Juzwenko, Thaddeus Mirecki.

Ossolineum's page, Historia i wsp√≥≈Çczesno≈õƒá During the subsequent German occupation of Lw√≥w, from 29 June 1941 to 27 July 1944, the Ossolineum library was incorporated into the structure of the new German Staatsbibilothek Lemberg. At the beginning of 1944, the German government decided to move not only the collection of Staatsbibilothek Lemberg (Lw√≥w's library), but also the university and polytechnic libraries and the Shevchenko Scientific Society collection. Following German orders, two archival consignments were prepared by professor Mieczys≈Çaw Gƒôbarowicz, the Ossolineum's manager during part of the war, and were supposed to include only specifically German literature and a reference book collection from the main reading room. However, in the event it also contained the most valuable and carefully selected special collections of the Ossolineum's cimelia. Gƒôbarowicz sent instructions by covert letters to his colleagues in Krak√≥w.Robert Bogdanowicz, \\"Przedwojenny profesor ze Lwowa\\" (in Polish) A portrait of Mieczys≈Çaw Gƒôbarowicz (TVP) Tygodnik, 23 February 2018 with video clips and illustrations Altogether there were 2,300 manuscripts, ca. 2,200 documents, ca. 1,700 old prints, ca. 2,400 figures and drawings from an old collection in the Lubomirski Museum, the Pawlikowski collection and hundreds of old coins. Moreover, it also included c. 170 of the most valuable manuscripts of another Polish foundation library the Baworowscy Library, and the most valuable manuscripts and incunabula of the University Library in Lw√≥w. Among the evacuated literature of the 19th and 20th centuries there were the autographs of Pan Tadeusz by Adam Mickiewicz, the entire literary legacy of Juliusz S≈Çowacki: his manuscripts with autographs of Mazepa, Lilla Weneda, Kr√≥l-Duch, and Aleksander Fredro, with autographs of Pan Jowialski, ≈öluby panie≈Ñskie, Zemsta and Do≈ºywocie, and the autographs of works by Seweryn Goszczy≈Ñski, Teofil Lenartowicz, J√≥zef Conrad, Henryk Sienkiewicz, including autographs of The Deluge, J√≥zef Ignacy Kraszewski, Jan Kasprowicz, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Reymont, including the autograph of Ch≈Çopi, and the papers of Stefan ≈ªeromski. The manuscript collection of Lw√≥w's own scholars was included in the move: Wojciech Kƒôtrzy≈Ñski, Ludwik Bernacki, Oswald Balzer, Karol Szajnocha along with the archive of the Galician activist peasant movement of Boles≈Çaw and Maria Wys≈Çouch. In terms of documents, the oldest and most valuable items were selected, including the documents of Pope Gregory IX from 1227 and the Silesian prince, Henry I the Bearded from 1229.Tadeusz Epsztein, Nieznane fakty z biografii Romana Aftanazego, Studia z Dziej√≥w Rosji i Europy ≈örodkowo- Wschodniej. The Ossolineum cargo reached German occupied Krak√≥w during March and April 1944, with the intention of safe storage in a cellar of the Jagiellonian Library during the expected military actions. However, in the summer of 1944, the consignment was transferred by the Germans further West and stored in Adelin (Zgrodno) near Z≈Çotoryja in Lower Silesia. Fortunately, it survived the whole war and in 1947 was able to be incorporated in the collection of the relocated Ossolineum Library in Wroc≈Çaw. After the subsequent reversal of military fortunes and a second seizure of the city of Lw√≥w by the Soviet army, till then under German occupation, from August 1944 the library holdings became part of the so-called Polish Sector of the Lviv Institute of Sciences' library. Only a small part of the library and archival material was transported from Lviv to Wroc≈Çaw during 1946‚Äì1947 as a \\"gift from the Ukrainian people to the Polish nation\\". It arrived in two train consignments in sealed carriages in Wroc≈Çaw, which was still in ruins at the time, and was opened to readers in September 1947.  Postwar appropriation and destruction  In 1946‚Äì1947, the Ukrainian authorities divided the Ossolineum collection into two parts. They followed the general rule that all materials referring to or with origins in lands east of the Curzon line, especially those connected with (in the Ukrainian commission's opinion) the history and culture of West Ukraine, and those connected in any way with Russia, Belarus, Podolia, Volhynia (Wo≈Çy≈Ñ), Lithuania, Turkey were to remain in Lviv. This rule applied even to those materials in which there was only a single reference to West Ukraine. As an example, a large carton of papers pertaining to Greater Poland and Silesian could not be released to Poland since it contained a single page referring to Zhovkva (≈ª√≥≈Çkiew). The same happened to foreign materials which, in the Ukrainian commission's opinion, were not connected to Poland.Norman Davies, God's Playground, a History of Poland, Columbia University Press, 1982, , p.558 Originally, the Ukrainians planned to hand over just 30,000 volumes from the Ossolineum Library. This number was reviewed several times so that in May 1946 it had finally reached 150,000 items including books, prints from the 19th and 20th centuries and manuscripts. It constituted only 15‚Äì20% of the entire collection because the graphical and cartographical collections, and almost the entire collection of Polish periodicals from the 19th and 20th centuries were not taken into consideration. Polish staff was not allowed to participate in the decision- making and were assigned solely to technical tasks, whereas management decisions and therefore ultimate control were the preserve solely of Ukrainian staff. The premises where materials were being packed were closed off, and Polish staff were denied access to them. The whole operation was conducted in a great hurry. While dividing the collections, apparently arbitrary criteria were applied. Among the deeply questionable decisions to withhold documents were: * King Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski's Act of abdication, as it was signed in Grodno (now Hrodna in Belarus) * The Leszczy≈Ñski materials of John Amos Comenius since he was not a Pole but a Bohemian * All materials concerning dissidents * Materials pertaining to the Bar Confederation * Diplomatic correspondence concerning the Partitions of Poland the former Saints Peter and Paul Jesuit Church in Lviv, where the Polish press collection was kept for 50 years before being destroyed rather than transferred to Poland In Lviv stayed a priceless collection of the Polish press, which lay unprotected and \\"temporarily\\" stored for 50 years in the Jesuit Saints Peter and Paul Church. This collection was subsequently deliberately destroyed as a part of the Soviet tendency to eradicate any evidence of Polish heritage and its 600-year role in the history of Lviv. The National Ossoli≈Ñski Institute in Lviv was renamed W. Stefanyk Lviv's National Scientific Library of Ukraine.  Partial transfer to Wroc≈Çaw  \\"The House under the Golden Sun\\" in Market Square, home of the Pan Tadeusz manuscript Since 1947, the Ossolineum Library in Wroc≈Çaw has been reassembled from the original collections in the Lw√≥w Ossolineum, which Poland had only partially recovered from the Soviet authorities. It is estimated that about a third of the entire Interwar period collection found its way to Wroc≈Çaw. The Wroc≈Çaw city authorities allocated a former German secondary Catholic boys school, which had ceased to function in 1945, as the main building for the Ossolineum in the old St. Matthew's Academy at 37, Szewska street. Two further buildings were later provided, one at 24, So≈Çtysowicka Street and the other a Museum and exhibition space at \\"Kamienica pod Z≈Çotym S≈Ço≈Ñcem\\" at 6, Rynek ('The House under the Golden Sun' at no. 6, in the Market Square). After the \\"Agrarian reform Act\\" 1945 in Poland which abolished landed estates, the main source of finance for the institute's maintenance dried up so the Budget took over responsibility in the new order of the Polish People's Republic. Since 1953, when the Polish Academy of Sciences came into being, the Ossolineum Library and publishing house became integrated with the Academy institutions as two distinct operations, whereas the Lubomirski Muzeum was closed down.  The Ossolineum today  Copernicus's De Revolutionibus manuscript in the Ossolineum With an Act of 5 January 1995, the National Ossoli≈Ñski Institute was granted the status of a foundation subsidized from the National Exchequer. At the same time the Ossolineum stopped being part of the Polish Academy of Sciences. Relations between the Ossolineum and the Stefanyk Library were established in the early 1990s, but for a long time, the parties could not come to a mutually satisfactory agreement. In 1997, Poland put forward a proposal for the return of all of the Ossolineum collections from Lviv. In 2003, the Ossolineum was offered the option of full access to the Polish collection stored in the Stefanyk Library with access to copy (scanning and microfilming) for research purposes by Polish specialists. In Wroc≈Çaw an agreement was reached and signed about mutual access for copying the extant Polish and Ukrainian collections in Lviv. In 2006, the Lviv branch of the Wroc≈Çaw National Ossoli≈Ñski Institute was opened. It is located in the renovated premises of the former Baworowscy Library. It consists of an exhibition hall and office for an Ossolineum employee, who is responsible for copying the collection, preparing a catalogue, vetting the condition of the collection and other maintenance needs. In 2015 the Ossolineum library contained items, including complete editions, serial editions, incunabula, manuscripts, prints, drawings, exlibris bookplates, coins and medals, seals, documents relating to social events and microfilms. History of ZNIO - The Ossolineum. =Continuing repository of Polish heritage= Ever since J√≥zef Ossoli≈Ñski donated his own vast collection to start the foundation and persuaded Henryk Lubomirski to do likewise in 1823, Poles have continued to donate their family collections to the Ossolineum. In some instances, there were deposits as \\"loans\\" or deposits for \\"safe-keeping\\" when the clouds of war began to gather. Such donations continue to this day. The story of the autograph of \\"Pan Tadeusz\\" is a case in point. When the representative of the original owners of Mickiewicz's epic, the Tarnowski family, came to reclaim their \\"deposit\\" of the Polish national bard's manuscript after the Fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, its destiny seemed on a knife-edge. Delicate negotiations as described by the Ossolineum's director, Adolf Juzwenko, and Mr. Tarnowski eventually led to a 1/3 purchase and 2/3 donation, which managed to both indemnify the family for a sum and ensure the autograph stayed in the Ossolineum. =Publishing House= Biblioteka Narodowa book series under the Ossolineum imprintEven before de- merging from the Polish Academy of Science, the publishing arm of the National Ossoli≈Ñski Institute continued its independent publishing operation and has resumed its popular world literary classics series, Biblioteka Narodowa, as well as major publishing projects, such as Roman Aftanazy's monumental work of reference Dzieje rezydencji na dawnych kresach Rzeczypospolitej - History of Residences in Poland's Former Eastern Borderlands, (1991‚Äì1997), in eleven volumes by voivodship listing, illustrating and describing the cultural heritage contained in the myriad estates and grand residences in the once Polish Kresy and Inflanty regions. The Lubomirski Museum The Lubomirski Museum in Wroc≈Çaw Restituted in part on 5 January 1995 to Wroc≈Çaw as the Lubomirski Museum, it is now the Fine art section of ZNIO housed in its own building.Ustawa z dnia 5 stycznia 1995 r. o fundacji ‚Äì Zak≈Çad Narodowy imienia Ossoli≈Ñskich (Dziennik Ustaw20171881), Statute of 5 January 1995 concerning the National Ossoli≈Ñski Foundation. Its foundation in Lw√≥w traces back to a pact made between prince Henryk Lubomirski and J√≥zef Ossoli≈Ñski on 25 December 1823. In 1939 the collection was seized by the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic on behalf of the USSR. The original collection consisted of works by leading European masters and items related to the history of Poland. =Departments= Jan Brueghel the Elder Landscape with Hermes in Wroc≈Çaw The Lubomirski collection in Lw√≥w was made up of: * Archeology and Ancient history ‚Äì arranged in chronological sections it contained examples ranging from archeological finds from the Neolithic, the Bronze and the Iron Age with many exhibits of Ceramic through to a museum in miniature of Polish martyrology, a numismatics collection to an Applied arts section with Polish sashes, Crystal glass and Jewellery, an antique horological section and objets including fans, tobacco boxes and other miniatures. * Painting Gallery ‚Äì with examples of Lucas Cranach the Elder, Canaletto, G√©rard, Mengs, Poussin, Vernet, Silvestre, Titian. The print and drawings section had examples of Etchings, Lithography and prints of the German, Dutch, French and English Schools, Old master prints and drawings, including by: Jan Brueghel the Elder, Rembrandt, Peter Paul Rubens, and twenty four original drawings by Albrecht D√ºrer that had attracted the personal attention of Hermann G√∂ring. The exceptional intervention of the US State Department led to the drawings being handed back to just one descendant of the Lubomirski family, who proceeded controversially to sell them off to various museums. Representatives of the Polish school of art were: Bacciarelli, Brandt, Fa≈Çat, Juliusz and Wojciech Kossak, Lampi, Matejko and his first canvas, depicting the Union of Lublin, Piotr Micha≈Çowski, Norblin, Aleksander Or≈Çowski, Kazimierz Pochwalski and Leon Wycz√≥≈Çkowski. Items from the Lubomirski collection recovered in Krak√≥w and in Zagrodno, Lower Silesia and part of the art that belonged to the Pawlikowski Library (Biblioteka Pawlikowskich), were handed to the Ossolineum, where they became the nucleus of the Cabinet of Graphic arts and the Numismatic section. At present there are 700 European works on paper from Henryk Lubomirski's original donation, from count Skarbek and part of the K√ºhnel donation. Over 1,600 drawings come from the Pawlikowski family bequest representing original works of Polish artists, from the letters \\"D\\" to \\"R\\", so the drawings by Daniel Chodowiecki and Franciszek Smuglewicz are missing. There are however European prints from the Pini≈Ñski bequest and several hundred Polish Art Deco and other prints of the interwar period and a collection of 218 Miniature Portraits. The remainder has been withheld in Lviv, including most of the paintings now in the Lviv Gallery of Art and part of the graphical collection, that is, works by Chodowiecki which remain in the Vasyl Stefanyk Library. Of the D√ºrer drawings, apart from one, they either went missing or were sold off. Distinguished employees =Literary curators= :* Jan Wincenty hr. BƒÖkowski 1818‚Äì1826 :* Henryk ks.

Business card CD Mini CDs, or pocket CDs, are CDs with a smaller diameter and one-third the storage capacity of a standard 120 mm disc. Formats Amongst the various formats are the *Mini CD single, a small disc. The format is mainly used for audio CD singles in certain regions (singles are sold on normal 120 mm CDs in many countries), much like the old vinyl single. An 80 mm disc can hold up to 24 minutes of music, or 210 MiB (210 √ó 220 bytes) of data. They are often referred to as Maxi CDs in some countries. **The low density version holds 18 minutes, or 155 MB. **Other formats are 185 MB (21 mins), which has the same data density as a 650 MB full-sized CD, and 210 MB (24 mins), with the same data density as a 700 MB full-sized CD, used for \\"Pocket\\" data storage. (see also miniDVD) *Business card CD (or \\"b-card\\"), a truncated (to the shape and size of a business card) disc with a storage capacity from 30 MB to 100 MB. **The long axis is 80 mm while the short axis (from flat side to flat side) is generally between 58 and 68 mm **The disc may be rectangular with wings added on, to square off the rounded 80 mm disc. *60 mm disc, a round version of the business card, with comparable capacity (50 MB) In 1997 Dean Procter of Imaginet was offering business card sized square CDs with full screen hi-fi stereo video which played in quad speed CD ROMs or DVD drives with the centre well. A variety of laser cut shapes were developed. When Mini CDs were first introduced in the United States, they were initially marketed as CD3, in reference to their approximate size in inches; larger CDs were called CD5, despite the fact that both CD specifications are defined solely in terms of metric units. Now, they are known as either Mini CDs or 80 mm CDs. Compatibility Most tray-loading CD devices have 2 'circular indentation'; one sized for a regular 120 mm CD, and a smaller, deeper circular indentation for Mini CDs to fit into, except for some Blu-ray players. Devices that feature a spindle also support Mini CDs, as the disc can simply be placed onto the spindle as with a normal CD. Some vertically aligned tray-loading devices, such as the older pre-slimline PlayStation 2 consoles when placed vertically, require an adapter for use with 80 mm CDs. Most slot- loading CD drives are generally incompatible (the PlayStation 3 and the car CD players in many Honda vehicles are exceptions), but adapters are available into which one can snap an 80 mm round Mini CD in order to extend the width to match that of a 120 mm CD, and thus work in many slot-loading devices. Most CD players in the late 1980s and early 1990s didn't handle the Mini CD circular indentation and required the use of an adapter, or very careful placement of the CD in the exact middle of the tray. Not until after the major record labels discontinued them, did the CD Players start to have the 80 mm circular indentation as standard. Since the mid-1990s, all tray loading players have a circular indentation for the Mini CD. Retail availability Mini CD-R, Mini CD-RW: As of 2020, many manufacturers offer 80 mm CD-R and CD-RW discs for sale in retail electronics and office supply stores. Most of the blank discs available in retail hold either 185 MB (21 minutes) or 210 MB (24 minutes) of data. The mini discs, despite having less weight and plastic, are generally more expensive than full size CD-R/CD-RW discs. Mini CD Replication Manufacturing: Custom-manufactured Mini CDs with integral data are available to the retail market. There are two variations on how the finished product is created: * Replicated to its finished size and shape: Through a single-step replication process the Mini CD is injection-molded to its finished size and shape and imprinted with data in exactly the same manner as full-size Audio CD or CDROM discs. * Replicated and machine-cut to its finished size and shape: Some CD replication companies make Mini CDs by taking full-size Audio CD or CDROM discs and machine-cutting them down to their finished size and shape. The short lived \\"Lid Rock\\" promotion that gave away CD singles on the underside of soda lids from Regal Movie Theaters used Mini CDs. Devices that use Mini CD While almost any spindle-based or tray-based CD device can utilize mini CD media, some devices have been designed expressly to use the smaller format, usually for portability reasons. = Sony D-88 = The first shirt-pocket CD player was the Sony D-88 (ca. 1990). It only played standard PCM audio (Red Book) CDs. It could play 120 mm discs if a guard was moved to allow the disc to protrude from the unit. =Compaq iPaq PM-1 Mini CD MP3 Player= In 2002, Compaq offered a compact, lightweight Mini CD player that made up for the capacity difference between 120 mm and 80 mm audio CDs by using MP3 compression, resulting in 1.1x to 3.5x the capacity of a standard audio CD, depending on compression ratio. =Memorex 8081 Mini CD MP3 Player= Memorex offered a portable CD player that matched the form factor for the 80 mm CD (Model MPD8081). The player was marketed as an MP3 device, and the user was encouraged to burn MP3 music files to a mini CD, and then play them in the player, which was noticeably smaller than a standard portable CD player. The player could also play Red Book audio content burned onto mini CDs. It can play both CD-R and CD-RW media, as well as pressed mini CDs. =Sony Mavica= Sony's Mavica line of digital cameras also offered some cameras that record directly to mini CD media. There were two models, the CD350 and the CD500, which offered 3.2 megapixels and 5.0 megapixels, respectively. These cameras could also record MPEG video directly to the Mini CD - a sort of precursor to mini DVD camcorders. The media size for these devices was quoted at 156 MB, rather than 185 MB. It is possible that these devices used a packet writing format which took away some available disk space for use by formatting information. A common problem for Mavica owners has been incorrect disc size. If a disc size other than 156 MB is used, the camera will appear to work, but data loss will likely occur. =Imation RipGo= The Imation RipGo! was a portable CD-R burner that was a similar form factor to that of the Memorex Mini CD player. Again, it was marketed as an MP3 device, and it could play MP3 and WMA files burned onto Mini CD media. It was powered by an internal lithium ion battery that could power the unit for five hours of playback. The device suffered some setbacks, most notably a slow CD initialize time (the time during which the drive analyzes the contents of an MP3 CD), maximum of 4X burning speed (due to the device using USB 1.1 to connect to its host computer), and no support for CD-RW media. Some have also reported issues using the device with 24 minute (210 MB) mini CD media; the device was shipped with 21 minute (185 MB) media and seemed unreliable when burning on the slightly higher density media. =Sony Photo Vault= Sony also manufactured a mini CD burning device, designed to be \\"PC-free.\\" The device allowed the user to directly burn images from a Memory Stick or a USB flash drive or camera to a mini CD. It was a precursor to the various portable media storage devices such as the iPod Photo adapters and various other hard disk based photo storage units.

It entered service in 1932 and was the standard Japanese heavy machine gun used during World War II. Known for its reliability, it was used after the war by various forces in East Asia. Designed by Kijiro Nambu and built by Hino Motors and Hitachi, its total production was about 45,000 guns. Design The Type 92 was essentially a scaled-up version of the Type 3 Heavy Machine Gun, with its calibre increased to 7.7 mm, and like the Type 3 was air cooled, ammo strip-fed, and based on the Hotchkiss M1914. It could use both a rimless and semi-rimmed 7.7x58mm Shiki round. A 7.7 mm round could be used if needed or if other ammunition supplies dwindled. Rounds fired from the gun traveled at about , and the rate of fire was about 450 rpm. It was sometimes used as a light anti-aircraft gun during the Pacific War. It was nicknamed \\"the woodpecker\\" by Western Allied soldiers because of the characteristic sound it made when fired due to its relatively low rate of fire, and the \\"chicken neck\\" () by Chinese soldiers due to its appearance. The Type 92 had a maximum range of 4,500 meters, but a practical range of 800 meters. The gun was intended to be fired on a tripod with a team of 3 men. The unusual tripod was designed with removable carry poles, so that the weapon could be transported fully assembled for quicker deployment. An unusual characteristic of this gun was the placement of its iron sights ‚Äì canted slightly to the right instead of center. A number of different sights were produced for the weapon, the Type 93 and Type 94 periscopic sights as well as the Type 96 telescopic sight. A ring- type anti-aircraft sight was also produced. Major problems with this weapon included the short feed strips, which did not allow for as high a volume of fire as a belt-fed gun, and the oiler, which enabled better extraction in clean conditions but could bring dirt inside the gun in the field. The gun has an internal oil pump which is mechanically activated by the bolt. The oil pump dispenses a small amount of oil onto a brush, which then lubricates each cartridge as it is fed into the gun.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgfYvC7LuBY  Combat history  It was used extensively by the Imperial Japanese Army and Collaborationist Chinese forces. Captured weapons were also used by Chinese National Revolutionary Army troops against the Japanese during World War II, the Korean People's Army against the United Nations forces during the Korean War, the Viet Minh against the CEFEO forces during the First Indochina War, and the Indonesian Army against the Netherlands Forces during the Indonesian National Revolution. The Type 92 refers to the Japanese Imperial year 2592 ‚Äì 1932 in the Gregorian calendar ‚Äì in which the gun entered service.

The group has its headquarters in New York City. OTC-traded securities are organized into three markets to inform investors of opportunities and risks: OTCQX, OTCQB and Pink.  History  The company was first established in 1913 as the National Quotation Bureau (NQB). For decades, the NQB reported quotations for both stocks and bonds, publishing the quotations in the paper-based Pink Sheets and Yellow Sheets respectively. The publications were named for the color of paper on which they were printed. NQB was owned by CCH from 1963 to 1993. In September 1999, the NQB introduced the real-time Electronic Quotation Service. The National Quotation Bureau changed its name to Pink Sheets LLC in 2000 and subsequently to Pink OTC Markets in 2008. The company eventually changed to its current name, OTC Markets Group, in 2010. Today, a network of 89 broker-dealers price and trade a wide spectrum of securities on the OTC Markets platform. To be quoted on the platform, companies are not required to file with the SEC, although many choose to do so. A wide range of companies are quoted on OTC Markets, including firmly established foreign firms, mostly through American depositary receipts (ADRs). In addition, many closely held, extremely small and thinly traded U.S. companies have their primary trading on the OTC Markets platform. Many foreign issuers adhere to the listing requirements of qualified foreign stock exchanges and make their home country disclosure available in English. There are also a significant number of U.S.-based issuers who are current in their reporting to regulators such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or make available ongoing quarterly and audited annual financial reports through OTC Markets Group. Many companies in the Pink market tier of the OTC categorization system do not meet the United States' listing requirements for trading on a stock exchange such as the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ. Many of these issuers do not file periodic reports or make available audited financial statements, making it very difficult for investors to find reliable, unbiased information about those companies. For these reasons the SEC views many of the lower-tier companies traded on OTC Markets as \\"among the most risky investments\\" and advises potential investors to heavily research the companies in which they plan to invest. Securities trading on the OTCQB and higher-tiered OTCQX trading marketplaces have status of Blue Sky secondary trading exemptions in 33 states and brokers may recommend such securities to their clients like securities listed on national stock exchanges.https://www.otcmarkets.com/corporate-services/products/blue-sky Markets OTC Markets Group designates securities in one of three markets to indicate the level of financial and corporate disclosure provided by the companies using its quotation system. Apart from the OTCQX market, which has rules that include financial requirements, the designations do not signify issuer quality or merit of any security. Designation is based on the level and timeliness of a company's disclosure and OTCQB and any of the Pink categories can include both high quality as well as speculative, distressed, or questionable companies. Strict promotion policies have been enacted to flag these companies and deny their application for trading if they engage actively in campaigns marked by misleading information or manipulative promotions. The OTCQX and OTCQB markets are considered 'Established Public Markets' by the SEC for the purpose of determining the public market price when registering securities for resale with the SEC in equity line financings. OTC Markets Group can facilitate electronic trading with its SEC-registered Alternative Trading System known as OTC Link¬Æ ATS. =OTCQX= The OTCQX market includes both multinational companies seeking access to U.S. investors and domestic growth companies. To be traded on this tier, companies must undergo a qualitative review by OTC Markets Group. Companies are not required to be registered with or reporting to the SEC, but they must post financial information with OTC Markets Group. In addition, U.S. companies must be ongoing operations (i.e., no shells) and may not be in bankruptcy, while foreign issuers must meet the requirements of qualified foreign exchanges. Additional oversight of OTCQX securities is provided by requiring every issuer to be sponsored by approved third-party investment banks or law firms, called OTCQX Sponsors. =OTCQB= The OTCQB market contains a one penny ($0.01) bid price requirement \\"intended to remove companies that are most likely to be the subject of dilutive stock fraud schemes and promotions\\". Each company verifies via an annual OTCQB Certification, signed by the company CEO or CFO, that their company information is current, including information about a company‚Äôs reporting status, company profile, information on management and boards, major shareholders, law firms, transfer agents, and IR / PR firms. Investor confidence improves when there is more information about a company‚Äôs ownership structure, professional advisors and service providers. This certification will be required for any security newly qualified to be publicly quoted by a broker-dealer under SEC Rule 15c2-11, or when a Pink traded company becomes a current SEC reporting company, beginning May 1, 2014. International Reporting companies are also allowed to upgrade from Pink to OTCQB if they publish their 12g3-2(b) compliant disclosure online and verify their company profile. There is an annual fee for the OTCQB market of $12,000 per year and a one-time $2,500 application fee.  OTC QX/QB Blue Sky Status  As of November 2018, the OTCQX Market has Blue Sky status in 33 states and the OTCQB Market in 30 states. Blue Sky Laws are state regulations established as safeguards for investors against securities fraud. The laws, which may vary by state, typically require sellers of new issues to register their offerings and provide financial details. This allows investors to base their judgments on verifiable information. Since the SEC recognized OTCQX and OTCQB as established public markets, OTC Markets Group has worked collaboratively with state regulators since the 2014 JOBS ACT to apprise them of the easily accessible, free, public online disclosure of current information provided by companies traded on the OTCQX and OTCQB premium markets. As of April 2018, 60% of the 50 states now acknowledging the OTCQX Market for the purposes of secondary trading exemptions. The investor protection and quality control standards of the OTXQX and OTCQB therefore are of Status to meet or exceed the Blue Sky standards of the respective states.https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blueskylaws.asphttps://www.prnewswire.com/news- releases/otc-markets-group-achieves-blue-sky-exemptions- in-30-states-300626613.html =Pink= Pink is an open market that has no financial standards or reporting requirements. The stock of companies in the Pink tier are not required to be registered with the SEC. Companies in this category are further categorized by the level and timeliness of information they provide to investors and may have current, limited, or no public disclosure. Current Information Companies submitting regular Quarterly and Annual Reports go into the Current category. This category can still include shell companies or development stage companies with little or no operations as well as companies without audited financial statements. Companies in this category must not only have Quarterly reports duly posted every three months, but most have Annual reports for at least the preceding two years on file. Limited Information Companies that have submitted information no older than six months to the OTC Markets data and news service or have made a filing on the SEC's EDGAR system in the previous six months are rated as having limited information. Companies that are unwilling or unable to meet OTC Markets' Guidelines for Providing Adequate Current Information with Quarterly and Annual Reports every three months, but which still submit information at least every six months, are in this category. These are often companies with financial reporting problems, economic distress, or in bankruptcy. No Information This tier indicates companies that are unwilling or unable to provide disclosure to the public markets. Companies in this category do not make current information available via OTC Markets disclosure and news service, or if they do, the available information is older than six months. This category includes defunct companies that have ceased operations as well as \\"dark\\" companies with questionable management and market disclosure practices. Securities of publicly traded companies that are not willing to provide information to investors are considered highly risky. Caveat Emptor There is a public interest concern associated with the company designated as Caveat Emptor. Buyer beware. This may include a spam campaign, stock promotion or known investigation of fraudulent activity committed by the company or through inside information. During a spam campaign, any stock that is not in the Current Information category will also have its quotes blocked on otcmarkets.com.  Quotation eligibility  The SEC requires broker-dealers to comply with Exchange Act Rule 15c2-11 before displaying quotes on OTC securities, and requires submission of Form 211 to the FINRA OTC Compliance Unit. In 2019, amendments were proposed to 15c2-11, which had not been significantly amended since 1991. FINRA Rule 6500 contains rules on quoting OTC securities on the OTCBB, but the OTCBB has diminished in importance and by 2016 less than 2% of OTC trades occurred on the OTCBB, as opposed to OTC Markets. In 2014, FINRA proposed to remove Rule 6500 and eliminate the OTCBB, but withdrew the rule and in 2016 proposed to update the OTCBB to provide a backup system in case quotation is disrupted or nonexistent. Other FINRA rules such as Rule 6432 and Rule 5250 relate to the SEC Rule 15c2-11; for example, Rule 5250 prohibits market makers from receiving compensation from issuers.  Risks and regulation  Many of the stocks traded OTC are microcap stocks, also known as penny stocks, which are known for fraudulent microcap stock fraud and penny stock scams. After the passage of Sarbanes-Oxley Act in 2002, some companies delisted and became OTC to save costs and avoid certain regulations, although OTC companies have faced pressure to improve disclosure.  Other OTC markets  = OTCBB = The OTC Bulletin Board (OTCBB) is only a listing of securities that are also traded \\"over the counter\\" similar to the OTC Markets. The OTCBB has diminished in importance, with very little activity, but has been retained as possible last resort system in case of disruption. OTCBB companies are required to file timely reports to a U.S. regulatory agency. Almost all OTCBB companies are now quoted via OTC Markets' OTC Link ATS because its fully electronic trading platform better meets the needs of automated broker-dealers. = Grey Market = Securities that are not listed on any stock exchange nor formally quoted on OTC Markets or OTCBB are considered to be in the Grey Market. Unsolicited transactions are processed independently and not centrally listed or quoted. Trades are reported to a self-regulatory organization (SRO), which then passes the data on to market data companies. The Grey Market is also called OTOTC or Other OTC. Compliance Data Products =Compliance Analytics= The Compliance Analytics Product creates a security specific risk score for all OTCQX, OTCQB, Pink and Grey securities. Risk is assessed over 19 parameters including caveat emptor, shell status, penny stock status, price/volume changes and stock promotion data. Recently, the product integrated \\"Hot Sector\\" information about cannabis, cryptocurrency and blockchain. =Promotion Data= The Promotion Data Product provides market professionals and investors with active and historical promotion data for OTCQX, OTCQB, Pink and Grey securities.

Klingler) is a composer that works in the genres of Noise, Drone and/or Ambient music. Background American composer, Phillip B. Klingler, better known as PBK, has been active in the experimental music underground since 1986.\\"Discogs - Artist Profile\\", accessed 30 May 2011 His work first became known through the homemade independent cassette culture scene of the 1980s, though later releases have also been in compact disc and LP format. His work has correlations to electroacoustic, classic industrial and free jazz genres. His compositions are created using extreme turntable manipulation, sampling, analog and digital synthesis. Improvising spontaneously and with little preconception, PBK creates pulsing, dense soundscapes of unknown sonic origin. In the years 1992-1996, PBK lived in Puerto Rico where he began experimenting with record turntables and extreme use of MIDI sequencer programming creating an early form of glitch best exemplified by the cassette album, Listening To The World Vibrate. Several other projects were completed including a 3-LP boxset titled Domineer/Asesino/Retro and a CD release titled Life-Sense Revoked, a collaboration with other artists. PBK has performed live throughout the U.S. and in Europe. A restless collaborator, he has worked with some of the most respected names in experimental music. A partial list would include such musicians as Asmus Tietchens, Aube, Jarboe(Swans), Jim O'Rourke, Min√≥y, Vidna Obmana and Wolf Eyes. Over the course of nearly thirty years PBK has had over 75 full-length albums released internationally, establishing a complex body of work that reveals a unique approach to the Noise music aesthetic.

Glasser was a member of the Perlo group of Soviet spies during World War II and worked closely with Harry Dexter White. His code name in Soviet intelligence and in the Venona files is \\"Ruble\\".Eduard Mark, \\"In Re Alger Hiss: A Final Verdict from the Archives of the KGB\\" Journal of Cold War Studies 11.3 (2009): 26-67John Earl Haynes, \\"The Characteristic of Ales in Venona 1822 compared to Foote, Stettinius, and Hiss\\" 7 June 2007 accessed: 6 Sept 2010 Transfer to GRU Harold Glasser joined the United States Department of Treasury in 1936 and became its assistant director of the Division of Monetary Research by late 1938. In 1937, J. Peters transferred Glasser to the Soviet Main Intelligence Directorate (Glavnoe Razvedyvatel'noe Upravlenie) or GRU in order to report on Harry Dexter White's cooperation with Soviet intelligence (Soviet case officer Boris Bykov had pressured Whittaker Chambers on the subject of White's intelligence production). Glasser, the number two man in the division beneath White, reported back that as far as he could discern, White was providing everything of importance. In 1940, Glasser was appointed Chief American economic adviser to Ecuador through a joint program of the Treasury and U.S. Department of State. In December 1941, the Secret Service forwarded a report to Harry Dexter White indicating that it had evidence Glasser was involved in Communist activities. White never acted on the report. Glasser continued to serve in Ecuador until 1942. After America became involved in World War II, Glasser received appointments to higher-level positions, such as Vice-Chairman of the War Production Board, was dispatched to serve as economic adviser to American forces in North Africa, U.S. Treasury representative to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and Treasury representative to the Allied High Commission in Italy. Perlo group When Glasser returned to the United States in 1944, he reestablished contact with the Perlo group. Victor Perlo, the groups head, explained to Elizabeth Bentley that Glasser had been a member of the group before the War started, and Glasser was transferred to work with another group. Charles Kramer, another member of the Perlo group, told Bentley that Glasser joined Alger Hiss' group. In a 25 April 1945 memo from Pavel Fitin, head of KGB foreign intelligence, to Vsevolod Merkulov, head of the overall KGB organization, Fitin asked fair treatment for an award to be given to a longtime operative, Harold Glasser. Fitin called Merkulov's attention to the fact that Glasser had been working for Soviet intelligence for a long time, since May 1937, usually for the KGB but also at times for the GRU. Fitin explained how, while Glasser was working with the GRU, Glasser felt he had been slighted. Fitin explained how the group of GRU agents of which Glasser was part, was decorated with honors of the Soviet Union, but Glasser had been neglected because of his transfer back to KGB. The text from KGB Archives reads in part as follows: > Our agent RUBLE, drawn to work for the Soviet Union in May 1937, passed > initially through the military \\"neighbors\\" and then through our station > valuable information on political and economic issues. ... To our work RUBLE > gives much attention and energy is devoted and disciplined agent. > According to data from VADIM the group of agents of the \\"military\\" neighbors > whose part RUBLE was earlier, recently was decorated with orders of the > USSR. RUBLE learned about this fact from his friend ALES, who is the head of > the mentioned group. Taking into account RUBLE's devoted work for the USSR > for eight years and the fact that, as a result of transfer to our station, > RUBLE was not decorated together with other members of the ALES group, > consider expedient to put him forward for a decoration of the Order of the > Red Star. Ask for your consent. Fitin's account corroborates Elizabeth Bentley's deposition. In the transcript # 1759 KGB Washington to Moscow 28 March 1945, Glasser reports the Treasury Department is sending a young lawyer, Josiah DuBois, to Moscow to serve on the American delegation to the Allied Reparations Commission meeting. Glasser says he established \\"most friendly relations\\" with DuBois and judged him to be ideologically a Communist, although he was not a CPUSA member. Glasser reports how he counseled DuBois to be more \\"discreet\\" in expressing left-wing views and notes that his personal relationship with DuBois was such that he could \\"normally obtain by asking\\" anything he wanted. Glasser is in the subject of several June 1945 Venona cables. Three June 1945 transcripts report Glasser's transmitting U.S. State Department reports of Soviet war losses, a State Department report on a Finnish company believed to be hiding Nazi financial assets, and an Office of Strategic Services report on the movement of Nazi gold through Swiss banks. SISS investigation After the war, he was economic adviser to the American delegation at the Council of Foreign Ministers meeting in Moscow in 1947 and economic adviser to the Treasury secretary at the board of governors meeting of the World Bank. In December 1947, at the time of his resignation, Glasser was assistant director of Treasury's Office of International Finance. Glasser's promotions and job ratings throughout his career were determined by fellow Communists Frank Coe and William Ullmann; promotions and job ratings were reviewed and backed by Harry Dexter White. Transcripts of Glasser's promotions and job rating forms signed by Coe, Ullmann, and White are in Interlocking Subversion in Government Departments Report. Pavel Fitin later described as \\"valuable\\" the political and economic information Glasser passed along, all of which found its way into thirty-four special reports to Joseph Stalin and other top Kremlin leaders. Glasser's materials were \\"all of critical interest to the leadership of the USSR\\" because it included the contents of an Office of Strategic Services (OSS) memorandum about the economic consequences of stripping Germany of heavy industry; an internal memorandum from the Department of the Treasury concerning conferences at State Department on postwar reparations; and an internal memorandum by the Treasury Department concerning Lend-Lease policy toward the Soviet Union. A 4 June 1945 cable reports Glasser would be on the Treasury committee advising Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson, the U.S. prosecutor at the Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal.

Life Richardson was born at Queenston, Ontario on the Niagara River in 1796. His mother Madelaine was the daughter of the fur trader John Askin and an Ottawa woman. His father, Dr. Robert Richardson, was a surgeon with the Queen's Rangers. As a young boy, Richardson lived for a time with his grandparents in Detroit and later with his parents at Fort Malden, Amherstburg. His time at Fort Malden would later impact his literature and his life. At age 16, Richardson enlisted in the British 41st Regiment of Foot. During his service with this regiment. he met Chief Tecumseh and Major General Isaac Brock, whom he later wrote about in his novel The Canadian Brothers. While stationed at Fort Malden during the War of 1812, Richardson witnessed the execution of an American prisoner by Tecumseh's forces at the River Raisin, a traumatic experience which haunted him for the rest of his life. During the War of 1812, Richardson was imprisoned for a year in the United States after his capture during the battle of Moraviantown. Richardson was commissioned into the 8th Foot in 1813, exchanged into the 2nd Foot in 1816 and transferred to the 92nd Foot in 1818. His later military service took him to England and, for two years, to the West Indies. While in the West Indies, Richardson was appalled by the treatment of slaves there. Richardson stated that his mixed racial background made him uneasy with his fellow officers in the West Indies. This may have contributed to his evenhanded treatment of First Nations people in his novels. Richardson's most savage characters, Wacousta in the novel Wacousta (1832) and Desborough in The Canadian Brothers (1840), are in fact white men who have turned \\"savage\\". Richardson began his fiction-writing career with novels about the British and French societies of his time. In his third and most successful novel, Wacousta, he turned to the North American frontier for his setting and history. He followed the same practice in the sequel, The Canadian Brothers. In 1838, Richardson returned to Canada from England, promoted to the rank of major. He tried to earn his livelihood by writing fiction and by setting up a series of weekly newspapers. He was appointed superintendent of the police on the Welland Canal in 1845, but was fired the next year. In 1849 Richardson moved to New York City, where he continued to write fiction. However, his attempts to build a literary career in the US failed. John Richardson died (supposedly of starvation) in New York City in 1852. He was buried in the paupers' cemetery in New York; his grave site is unknown.  Further reading  * Michael Hurley: The Ward of 1812: Major John Richardson.

Federal judges, prisoners and those in mental institutions have gained the franchise as a result of this provision, whereas the restriction on minors voting was found to be permissible due to section 1. Section 3 is one of the provisions in the Charter that cannot be overridden by Parliament or a legislative assembly under Section 33 of the Charter, the notwithstanding clause. Section 3's exemption from Section 33 provides extra legal protection to the right to vote and it may prevent Parliament or the provincial governments from disenfranchising any Canadian citizen for ideological or political purposes, among others. Text Under the heading \\"Democratic Rights,\\" the section reads: History No formal right to vote existed in Canada before the adoption of the Charter. There was no such right, for example, in the Canadian Bill of Rights. Indeed, in the case Cunningham v. Tomey Homma (1903), it was found that the government could legally deny the vote to Japanese Canadians and Chinese Canadians (although both groups would go on to achieve the franchise before section 3 came into force).Hogg, Peter W. Canada Act 1982 Annotated. Toronto: The Carswell Company Limited, 1982. Interpretation Stephen Harper, who as leader of the National Citizens Coalition challenged limits on campaign spending in Harper v. Canada, and as leader of the Conservative Party of Canada opposed prisoners' voting rights after Sauv√© v. Canada. =Voting= The section has generated some case law expanding the franchise. In 1988, section 3 had been used to grant suffrage to federal judges and those in mental institutions. A more controversial example is Sauv√© v. Canada (2002),Sauv√© v. Canada (Chief Electoral Officer) [2002] 3 S.C.R. 519. in which it was found that prisoners could vote. They did so in the 2004 federal election, despite public opposition from Conservative leader Stephen Harper.CBC.ca, \\"Canada has restricted political rights to Canadians living abroad for more than 5 years. 12,500 prisoners get to vote on June 28,\\" Thu, 03 Jun 2004 09:28:42 EDT. In the 2002 case Fitzgerald v. Alberta,Fitzgerald v. Alberta (CanLII), [2003] 3 WWR 752. the Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta found that although a minimum voting age of 18 violated section 3 of the Charter, it was justifiable under section 1 of the Charter. The decision was upheld upon appeal.Fitzgerald v. Alberta (CanLII), [2004] 6 WWR 416. =Candidate Requirements= In Figueroa v Canada (AG) the court determined that Section 3 explicitly grants both the right to vote and the right to run for office to all Canadian citizens. In Szuchewycz v. Canada the Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta found that the $1000 federal candidate deposit requirement violated Section 3 and could not be justified under Section 1. Justice Inglis noted in paragraph 59 \\"I agree that the potential to prevent a serious and impressive candidate from running in an election, due to the financial pressure a $1000 deposit could create, is a real risk of the requirement. In my opinion, the impugned Deposit Requirement Provision would infringe many individuals‚Äô ‚Äì including the Applicant‚Äôs ‚Äì ability to communicate their messages to the public, and participate meaningfully in the electoral process as a candidate.\\" =Electoral participation and political spending= Generally, the courts have interpreted section 3 as being more generous than simply providing a right to vote. As stated in the case Figueroa v. Canada (2003),Figueroa v. Canada (Attorney General) (CanLII), [2003] 1 S.C.R. 912. the section has been viewed as a constitutional guarantee to \\"play a meaningful role in the electoral process,\\" which in turn encourages governmental \\"respect for a diversity of beliefs and opinions.\\" This does not mean, however, that interest groups have complete freedom to promote their beliefs and opinions. Since the voter must have an opportunity to balance various ideas in his or her own mind before meaningfully participating in an election, the Supreme Court has, in the case Harper v. Canada (Attorney General) (2004),Harper v. Canada (Attorney General), (CanLII). upheld laws that limit the amount of money a single group can contribute in the election (to prevent a monopolization of the campaign). =Sizes of constituencies= Although one cannot see this on the face of the Charter, the Supreme Court has also ruled that section 3 guarantees a measure of equality in voting. In Reference re Prov. Electoral Boundaries (Sask.) (1991),Reference re Prov. Electoral Boundaries (Sask.), [1991] 2 S.C.R. 158. it was found that constituencies should have roughly the same number of voters, although perfection was not required. The reasoning behind this expansion of section three's meaning was that it supposedly reflected the original purpose of the section, namely to allow \\"effective representation.\\" The concession that perfection is not required stemmed from the fact that perfection would be impractical, given geographical limits in drawing boundaries and a general desire to give minorities more representation. While Saskatchewan's constituencies were found to be valid in the 1991 decision, Prince Edward Island's were later deemed unconstitutional by the courts and the province's electoral map had to be redrawn. =Referenda= While section 3's reach has been expanded to cover the sizes of constituencies, it has not been extended to guarantee the right to vote in a referendum. In Haig v. Canada (1993),Haig v. Canada, 1993 CanLII 58 (S.C.C.), [1993] 2 S.C.R. 995. it was ruled that since section 3 was designed in specific reference to electing representatives, the right could not include participation in a \\"device for the gathering of opinions\\". It was also noted that unlike elections, governments do not have to hold referendums, nor do governments have to commit themselves to the result of a referendum. Thus, how a referendum is administered is within governmental discretion.

It was established by a decree of the Holy See dated 25 May 1927, when it was separated from the Calcutta Archdiocese to form a new Diocese, with its episcopal seat at Ranchi. In 1953 it was elevated to the status of an archdiocese. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Ranchi declares that it \\"subscribes to ahimsa and satyagraha\\". Background The first Belgian Jesuit to enter Chotanagpur was Fr Auguste Stockman. He traveled by bullock cart from Midnapur and after a difficult journey of a fortnight reached Chaibasa on 25 November 1868. His work among the Ho tribe did not yield results, so he moved towards Ranchi district in January 1875. Other Belgian Jesuits came to Ranchi in 1877 to act as military chaplains to the troops at Doranda (Ranchi). As the prospects of evangelization among the tribals of Chotanagpur were bright, the first mission stations were opened among the Mundas. However, the real impetus came from Fr Constant Lievens, who arrived at Doranda on 18 March 1885. He is often called the Apostle of Chotanagpur. He left Ranchi on 26 August 1892, a broken man. He died at Leuven in Belgium on 7 November 1893. A century later on 7 November 1993 his mortal remains were re-interred in the Ranchi Cathedral. To assist the missionaries, the Loreto Sisters from Ireland opened a convent in the red Lodge on Purulia Road, Ranchi, in March 1890. It was here that the Daughters of St. Anne, a Diocesan Congregation, had their beginning in 1897. The Ursuline Sisters of Tildonk, Belgium established themselves in the same compound on 13 January 1903. History By 1927 the Ranchi Mission had developed to such an extent that by decree of the Holy See, dated 25 May 1927, it was separated from the Calcutta Archdiocese to form a new Diocese with Ranchi as its Episcopal seat and Msgr. Louis Van Hoeck, sj, as the first bishop. He was succeeded by Rt. Rev. Oscar Sevrin sj, in 1934, who was pastor for 18 years (1934 - 1952). As the faith spread and took firm root in Chotanagpur, the Catholic Church was being built up and developed, especially through parishes and schools. Soon the rapid growth of the mission made it imperative to call in other labourers, the S.V.D. Fathers, the Australian and American Jesuits. For better pastoral care of the faithful, the vast Archdiocese of Ranchi was divided and on 14 June 1951, the Diocese of Sambalpur gave birth to Rourkela Diocese on 4 July 1979 and Ambikapur became a separate diocese on 14 December 1977. On 19 September 1953, the Diocese of Ranchi was raised to the status of an Archdiocese with Sambalpur and Cuttack as its suffragans. On 2 July 1962, the Diocese of Jamshedpur was created. Then in 1968, the Diocese of Patna and Bhagalpur and the Prefecture of Balasore were made suffragans of Ranchi Archdiocese. Again on 5 June 1971 the Diocese of Daltonganj, comprising the civil districts of Hazaribagh (which itself became a diocese on 12 May 1995), and Palamau was carved out of the Archdiocese of Ranchi. In 1980, Muzaffarpur Diocese was formed from a part of Patna Diocese and made suffragan of Ranchi. The Andamans and Nicobar Islands, became part of Ranchi in 1947, and were since 1966 under the care of the Pilar Fathers, and became a new Diocese on 26 June 1984. On 1 July 1993, two new Dioceses, Gumla and Simdega, were established with territories taken from the Ranchi Archdiocese. On 12 May 1995 the new Diocese of Khunti was established with territories taken from the Archdiocese of Ranchi. It comprises the whole Khunti civil Sub-division. In 1998 two more new Dioceses were created, North of the Ganges, and made suffragans of Ranchi, Bettiah and Purnea. Thus the original Ranchi Diocese divided into 14 Dioceses including the present Archdiocese of Ranchi. On 16 March 1999 the Ranchi Ecclesiastical Province was bifurcated in anticipation of the creation of Jharkhand. Patna, Capital of Bihar, became an Archdiocese with four suffragans: Bettiah, Bhagalpur, Muzaffarpur and Purnea. The dioceses Daltonganj, Dumka, Gumla, Hazaribag, Jamshedpur, Khunti, Port Blair and Simdega are suffragans of the archdiocese. Leadership Cardinal Telesphore Toppo was Archbishop of Ranchi from 1985 to 2018. Vincent Barwa is auxiliary bishop since 2004. Binay Kandulna was appointed auxiliary bishop in February 2009. Felix Toppo is the present Archbishop of Ranchi. He was appointed as the Archbishop of Ranchi on 24 June 2018 and was installed on 6 June 2018.

As a part of a broader range of legal rights guaranteed by the Charter, section 10 rights may be limited by the Oakes test and/or the notwithstanding clause. However, section 10 has also spawned considerable litigation, and has made an impact in numerous cases. Text The section reads: Detention Section 10 is only triggered if a person is arrested or detained. In R v Grant, the Supreme Court stated that \\"detention\\" refers to a suspension of an individual's liberty interest by a significant physical or psychological restraint. Psychological detention is established either where the individual has a legal obligation to comply with the restrictive request or demand, or a reasonable person would conclude from the state conduct that there was no choice but to comply. In cases without physical restraint or legal obligation, it may not be clear whether a person has been detained. To determine whether a reasonable person in the individual‚Äôs circumstances would conclude they had been deprived by the state of the liberty of choice, the court may consider, inter alia, the following factors:R. v. Grant, para. 44 *The circumstances giving rise to the encounter as would reasonably be perceived by the individual: whether the police were providing general assistance; maintaining general order; making general inquiries regarding a particular occurrence; or, singling out the individual for focussed investigation. *The nature of the police conduct, including the language used; the use of physical contact; the place where the interaction occurred; the presence of others; and the duration of the encounter. *The particular characteristics or circumstances of the individual where relevant, including age; physical stature; minority status; level of sophistication. Explanation of arrest or detention Section 10(a) requires that a person who is arrested or detained must be told why. In R. v. Latimer (1997), the Supreme Court of Canada considered an argument in which a person, Robert Latimer, was told he was being \\"detained\\", but was not told he was being \\"arrested\\" and could be charged with the murder of his daughter. The Court found section 10(a) was not infringed. Section 10(a) is meant to ensure those arrested or detained are aware of the gravity of the situation. Latimer argued that since the police did not call the detention an arrest, he was not fully aware of the severity of the trouble he was in. He also claimed this was the reason why he had declined to talk to a lawyer. The Court argued the words used did not matter, but rather how the suspect can interpret the situation. Latimer could be expected to understand the seriousness of the situation since he was told he was being detained in connection with his daughter's death. The police had explicitly said the situation was serious, and had told him of rights one has when being arrested. Counsel The right to consult a lawyer is considered to be important, and the courts have been understanding if, even in cases in which the person arrested or detained preferred not to see any lawyer, it is later argued section 10 is violated because the arrested or detained person did not know any better. This applies, for example, to cases in which the arrested or detained person has a low IQ.Dyck, Rand. Canadian Politics: Critical Approaches. Third ed. (Scarborough, Ontario: Nelson Thomson Learning, 2000), p. 439. Section 10 has also been held not only to guarantee the right to see a lawyer, but also a right to be told that one may see a lawyer, a right to legal aid, and a right to be told that one may seek legal aid. Although the right to counsel itself could be found in the 1960 Canadian Bill of Rights, the right to be told that one may see counsel is new to Canadian bills of rights. Indeed, in the Bill of Rights case Hogan v. The Queen (1978), the Supreme Court found the right to be told that one may see a lawyer did not exist even in a penumbra of the Bill of Rights. \\"In effect,\\" Professors F.L. Morton and Rainer Knopff write, \\"section 10(b) of the Charter overrules Hogan.\\"Morton, F.L. and Rainer Knopff. The Charter Revolution & the Court Party. Toronto: Broadview Press, 2000, page 38. In R. v. Bartle (1994) the Supreme Court ruled that rights to be informed that one may seek counsel included rights to be told of duty counsel and how to obtain it (e.g., through a free telephone call).

An example of bilingualism at the federal government level. Section 16 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms is the first of several sections of the Constitution dealing with Canada's two official languages, English and French. Section 16 declares that English and French are the official languages of Canada and of the province of New Brunswick. Text Under the heading \\"Official Languages of Canada\\", the section reads: Function This section sets out general principles that are expanded in sections 16.1 to 22. Section 16 itself expands upon language rights in the Constitution Act, 1867; whereas section 133 of the Constitution Act, 1867 merely allowed for both languages to be used in the Parliament of Canada and in the Quebec legislature, and in some courts, section 16 goes further by allowing bilingualism in the federal and New Brunswick bureaucracies, and in the New Brunswick legislature.Hogg, Peter W. Constitutional Law of Canada. 2003 Student Ed. Scarborough, Ontario: Thomson Canada Limited, 2003. This was not entirely new, as Canada's Official Languages Act had provided for this at the federal level since 1969, and New Brunswick had similar legislation. Those laws, however, were merely statutes, and section 16 thus made some of their key aspects into constitutional principles. Judicial interpretation =Subsections 16(1) and 16(2)= It has not been easy to understand how section 16 can be applied. In Soci√©t√© des Acadiens v. Association of Parents (1986), Chief Justice Brian Dickson made reference to the \\"academic debate about the precise significance of s. 16,\\" and the question of \\"Whether s. 16 is visionary, declaratory or substantive in nature.\\" He did, however, decide that \\"at the very least it provides a strong indicator of the purpose of the language guarantees in the Charter [ie., sections 17 to 22]... the federal government of Canada and the government of New Brunswick have demonstrated their commitment to official bilingualism within their respective jurisdictions.\\" In the same case, Justice Jean Beetz wrote that the political nature of section 16, as opposed to the generous nature of the rights in the rest of the Charter, indicate that courts should be cautious in interpreting section 16 in new ways. Elected governments would play a larger role in determining its scope. Justice Bertha Wilson went on to speculate that section 16 is meant to represent an opportunity for expansion of language rights. Thus, courts must always ask themselves how their rulings fit in with the current state of affairs regarding official languages policy, and how their rulings are consistent with it. While the rights guaranteed under another language provision of the Charter, section 20, are limited, this does not mean that section 16 is limited or cannot have an effect on the growth of language rights. As far as New Brunswick is concerned, she added, bilingualism was considered \\"crucial\\" to \\"social and cultural development,\\" and thus there should be \\"heightened public expectations\\" that this could be supported by the Charter.Soci√©t√© des Acadiens v. Association of Parents (1986). In R. v. Beaulac (1999), the Supreme Court rejected some of its earlier conservative interpretations. It ruled that a purposive (generous) interpretation would be appropriate for language rights, since this would help minority language communities (i.e. those who speak English or French in a region where that language is the minority language) achieve equality. Many Charter cases regarding the use of the English and French languages have not been fought on the grounds of section 16.Dyck, Rand. Canadian Politics: Critical Approaches. Third ed. Scarborough, Ontario: Nelson Thomson Learning, 2000, p. 441. For example, Quebec's Bill 101, which limited the use of English, was considered to be invalid in certain respects not because it conflicted with section 16, but because it infringed freedom of expression, which is guaranteed by section 2 of the Charter. Likewise, section 16 does not really apply to provinces besides New Brunswick; as the only province that currently considers itself to be officially bilingual, New Brunswick is the only province to have its bilingualism guaranteed by section 16. When Manitoba's laws declaring English to be the only official language of the province were found to be invalid in Re Manitoba Language Rights (1985), this was due to its contradictions with the Manitoba Act. =Subsection 16(3)= Subsection 16(3) provides that a Parliament or provincial government may strive for progress in official bilingualism. This reflects a 1975 court decision, Jones v. Attorney General of New Brunswick, in which it was found governments may do this. Thus, the Supreme Court in Soci√©t√© des Acadiens has argued that it is the elected governments and \\"political compromise\\", rather than the courts, that will mostly advance language rights. Justice Wilson added that subsection 16(3) demonstrates that while language rights need to be improved, they should not be eroded once they have been established.

All stands can be converted into seaters, giving a capacity of around 13,000). It is the home ground of Allsvenskan side Helsingborgs IF. On October 22, 2014 the Helsingborg City Council, who owns Olympia, unanimously voted to renovate and rebuild the stadium. The construction will start after the 2014 Allsvenskan season and will be finished in early to mid 2017. This will be the fourth updating of the arena since 1985. Before 1985 the arena was in a dreadful state with athletic running tracks, wooden stands, and a very poor lighting system. The name of this arena has no actual connection to the Olympic Games, but since the modern Olympic's started in 1896 and Olympia was opened two years later, it seems a possible thought that the name was influenced by the at the time renewed Olympic Games. The record for attendance is 26,154 and was set 14 May 1954, when Helsingborgs IF played Malm√∂ FF. In 1958 the stadium hosted two FIFA World Cup matches, and seven matches in FIFA Women's World Cup 1995.

Biography He notably performed as a member of Long Beach Dub Allstars, but in 1998 it was an encounter with Cedric Bixler-Zavala and Omar Rodr√≠guez-L√≥pez of At the Drive-In at a concert in Irvine which proved fateful. In 1999 Owens lost his job at a financial management firm in Huntington Beach that \\"helped handle billion-dollar accounts for Disney and the Catholic Church\\", but he eventually received an invitation to join the dub reggae band De Facto and found himself touring Europe with Omar, Cedric, and Jeremy Ward. Not long after that he was once again invited to join their new project, The Mars Volta. Since then Owens was notable for being the longest tenured member of the Mars Volta outside Bixler-Zavala and Rodriguez-Lopez, having continually recorded and performed with the band since their 2001 inception, although this came to an end in 2011 when he was not asked by Rodriguez-Lopez to accompany The Mars Volta on their summer tour. The reasons for this decision are currently unknown, although on July 2 Mars Volta bassist Juan Alderete claimed that Owens was currently \\"producing bands these days.\\" Juan later noted, \\"He had some conflicts in his scheduling, and then it all just naturally evolved into what it is today.

Free Moral Agents released their second full-length album Control This in the fall of 2010 (9/28), the first album with the band's expanded line-up. Owens later became part of Jack White's all-male backup band The Buzzards, playing keyboards, organ and piano. He took part in the world tour in support of White's album Blunderbuss, and later also performed on White's second album, Lazaretto, and was in the middle of the supporting tour of the album at the time of his death. Death On October 14, 2014, Owens was found dead due to a heart attack in his hotel room in Puebla, Mexico, aged 39. Two remaining concerts in Mexico in support of Jack White's album, Lazaretto, were cancelled. The band had played in Mexico City three days earlier, in Puebla one night before the incident, and were scheduled to perform in Guadalajara the day of his death.

The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011‚Äì2015 categorized it as a general aviation reliever airport. Originally the airline airport for the New Orleans area, Lakefront Airport relinquished that role in summer 1946 when airline service began from Moisant International Airport (now Louis Armstrong International Airport), a larger facility in the nearby suburb of Kenner. Lakefront Airport continues as a general aviation airport with charter, private, and occasional military operations. Airline service is also available to destinations in the Gulf South Region. The terminal building's interior retains much of its original lavish 1930s decoration, and the art deco exterior, obscured for decades by a \\"bomb-proof\\" facade installed after World War II, has recently been returned to its original appearance. The terminal building houses a restaurant frequented by nearby residents, the Walnut Room. The sculpture in front of the terminal, \\"Fountain of the Winds\\" by Enrique Alferez, is a local landmark. Lakefront Airport was damaged by hurricane-force winds and the storm surge of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and a number of the hangars and outlying buildings were destroyed. While the airport soon resumed functioning, restoration of the terminal building and other facilities proceeds slowly. With the exterior of the main terminal fully restored, however, the classic Art Deco building was used as the headquarters of the fictional company Ferris Aircraft in the 2011 action hero film Green Lantern starring Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively. Since 2014 Lakefront Airport has hosted the WWII Air, Sea & Land Festival. The three-day airshow hosted by the National WWII Museum, Commemorative Air Force, and the Greater New Orleans Sports Foundation honor the men and women of WWII through aviation displays, vehicle displays, and WWII re-enactments.  History  Airport construction began in 1929 by orders of Huey Long, on a man-made peninsula dredged by the Orleans Levee Board, jutting into Lake Pontchartrain on the Eastern New Orleans side of the Industrial Canal. It was designed by New Orleans architect Leon C. Weiss and his firm Weiss, Dreyfous and Seiferth, which also designed the Louisiana State Capitol. It was originally named Shushan Airport after Levee Board president and Long ally Abraham Shushan. The airport opened on 10 February 1934. Visitors noticed that every doorknob, window sill, countertop, and plumbing fixture had the name or the initials of Abe Shushan.Brinkley, Alan \\"Voices of Protest\\" (Random House, 1882)30 After Shushan's name was tarnished from involvement in the Louisiana Scandals of the late 1930s, the airport was renamed New Orleans Airport in 1939. The assigned airport code \\"NEW\\" is retained despite its current \\"Lakefront Airport\\" name. Terminal in late 2005, before restoration During World War II the airfield was used by the United States Army Air Forces and housed the Tropical Weather School in 1945. At the start of the 1960s, thick concrete panels were added to the main terminal building to turn it into a Cold War era bomb shelter. Ammunition manufacturer Joyce Hornady was killed in a Piper Aztec on January 15, 1981. The aircraft, with Hornady at the controls flying in heavy fog, crashed into Lake Pontchartrain while on final approach to Lakefront Airport. Lakefront Airport was badly damaged by storm surge during Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and again during Hurricane Isaac in 2012. The airport was quickly brought back to service, but many facilities remained in temporary trailers for years after Katrina. On January 23, 2010 a United States Navy Beechcraft T-34 Mentor trainer crashed into Lake Ponchartrain just over a mile from the approach end of the airport. The aircraft was intending to land at Naval Air Station-Joint Reserve Base New Orleans but diverted to Lakefront Airport due to weather. The student pilot on board survived, but the instructor drowned. According to official reports, the aircrew lost track of their altitude which resulted in their ditching in the lake. Post-Katrina reconstruction at the airport has included restoration of the main terminal building's original Art Deco facade. The Art Deco interior and restoration of the Shushan terminal is being filmed for a television documentary titled, Return Flight. Filming began in 2012 and will conclude in 2013 when the restoration draws to a close.  Facilities Lakefront Airport covers 473 acres (191 ha) at an elevation of 7 feet (2 m). It has three asphalt runways: 18R/36L is 6,879 by 150 feet (2,097 x 46 m); 18L/36R is 3,697 by 75 feet (1,127 x 23 m); 9/27 is 3,114 by 75 feet (949 x 23 m). In the year ending July 19, 2016 the airport had 60,778 aircraft operations, average 166 per day: 91% general aviation, 3% military, and 6% air taxi. 125 aircraft were then based at this airport: 62% single-engine, 18% multi-engine, 15% jet and 6% helicopter.  In Popular Culture  The airport was used as a location in the 1973 James Bond film Live and Let Die.Moore, Roger & Hedison, David. The 007 Diaries: Filming Live and Let Die. The History Press, June 2018. The airport was the filming location of the film The Green Lantern starring Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively.

The highway takes a generally southeast-to-northwest direction between Frankfort on Lake Michigan and Clare in the central part of the state. The northwestern end is at M-22 next to Betsie Lake; the southeastern end in downtown Clare is at an intersection with Business US Highway 127 (Bus. US 127) and Bus. US 10\\\\. In between, the trunkline runs about through woodlands, including areas that are a part of either the Manistee National Forest or the Pere Marquette State Forest. The highway also passes agricultural areas, several lakes in the region and a state park near Cadillac. M-115 was first designated in the 1920s on the northwestern end near Frankfort. Additional, disconnected sections were designed as part of the trunkline in the 1930s near Cadillac, Farwell and Mesick. All but one of these gaps (Cadillac‚ÄìMesick) was eliminated by the end of that decade. The remaining segment was built in the 1950s to unite M-115 into a single highway. The last change came in 1989 when the highway was extended into Clare to its current southern terminus. Route description M-115 starts in downtown Clare at a four-way intersection with the two business loops, Bus. US 127 and Bus. US 10, in town. From this junction, M-115 runs west following the former routing of US 10 along Ludington Drive to Farwell. In the middle of town, M-115 turns northwesterly to meet the end of the US 10 freeway near Surrey Lake. The highway continues northwest through forest lands and lake country. The trunkline passes into northern Osceola County near its crossing of the Muskegon River. There are intersections with both M-66 and M-61 south of Marion near rural farms. The roadway subsequently crosses into southern Wexford County. Near Stone Lake south of Cadillac, M-115 meets US 131 and M-55. M-55 leaves the US 131 freeway and joins M-115, and the two run concurrently along the western end of Lake Cadillac. They separate near Lake Mitchell, and M-115 turns northwesterly between the two lakes passing Mitchell State Park and the eastern shore of the latter lake. Past the Cadillac area, M-115 runs through the northeastern corner of the Manistee National Forest. The highway continues through woodlands, passing several small lakes in the area as it approaches the community of Mesick. There it turns due west and joins M-37 through town. After M-37 separates to the south, M-115 crosses the Manistee River and continues its northwestern course. The highway crosses the northeastern corner of Manistee County and runs through the community of Copemish on the way to Benzonia. The landscape here turns more agricultural as the highway skirts southwest of Thompsonville crossing the Betsie River. After the river crossing, the highway enters Benzie County and runs through the Pere Marquette State Forest. South of Benzonia, M-115 runs concurrently with US 31 into town. The highways separate in the center of town where M-115 turns westward to run along the south shore of Crystal Lake past Frankfort Dow Memorial Field, the local airport near Frankfort. M-115 follows Forest Avenue, and the highway designation ends at the intersection in town with M-22 near Betsie Lake. The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) maintains M-115 like all other trunkline highways in the state under its jurisdiction. As a part of these responsibilities, the department tracks traffic volumes along its roadways until a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT). This number is a calculation of the traffic level along a segment of roadway for any average day of the year. In 2009, MDOT determined that the highest traffic levels along M-115 were the 12,079 vehicles daily along the section of highway near lakes Mitchell and Cadillac. The lowest AADT was the 2,236 vehicles near Copemish. The trunkline between the US 10 and M-37 junctions has been listed on the National Highway System. a network of roads important to the country's defense, economy and mobility. History In 1929, the first stretch of M-115 was designated from Frankfort to Benzonia. Beginning in the mid-1930s, construction of M-115 began from central to northwestern Lower Michigan. In 1936, an earthen highway was opened between the south side of Cadillac to M-66, with additional sections west of Mesick and northwest of US 10. By the end of the year, the state was paving the earthen section, completed a gravel highway near Mesick and opened an earthen section in Clare County. The section from Copemish to northwest of Mesick was opened as an earthen highway the next year. Construction started in early 1938 to connect Benzonia to Copemish, and before the year was out, the Michigan State Highway Department started work to fill in the gap between M-66 and the highway north of US 10 in Clare County. These two sections were completed as earth-graded highway in 1939. Both discontinuous sections were fully paved by 1945. In 1953, a county road was built along the path of the future M-115 between Mesick and Cadillac. This road was designated as a state highway by 1957, with a connection along Boon Road north of Cadillac and a concurrency along US 131 to close the gap in 1957. The Boon Road segment was removed the next year when the routing near Lake Mitchell opened. The southern end of M-115 was truncated slightly when the US 10 freeway bypass of Clare was opened in 1975. M-115 has since been rerouted in 1989 along the two-lane Old US 10 from its original southeastern ending point near the US 10 overpass through Farwell to Clare. A roundabout was built for the intersection with northbound M-37 east of Mesick and was opened in September 2013.

He founded the Ossoli≈Ñski Institute in Lw√≥w to which he donated his immense library and other collections of manuscripts and coins. J√≥zef was a member of many learned institutions, and a doctor honoris causa of the Jagiellonian University. He became one of the first Polish politicians from Galicia. He took Austrian citizenship when he became prefect of the Imperial Austrian Library in 1793 in Vienna. He employed Samuel Linde as his \\"Gr√§fliche Ossolinskische Bibliothekar\\", librarian of the Ossoli≈Ñski Library until 1803 and under his patronage compiler of the first Polish Lexicon.Arleta Adamska-Sa≈Çaciak, Linde's Dictionary: A landmark in Polish lexicography Biography He was born in Wola Mielecka, near Sandomierz. His father, Micha≈Ç Ossoli≈Ñski was castellan of Czch√≥w and owner of the estates at Mielec, Zg√≥rsk, Cyranka, PiƒÖtkowiec, Wola Mielecka, Partyn, Izbiska. His mother was Anna Szaniawska. He had a strict upbringing as befitted a young nobleman of the day. J√≥zef was regarded as deeply religious, modest and shy. From 1762 to 1771 he attended the highly rated Jesuit Collegium Nobilium in Warsaw. He was taught there by distinguished professors, Adam Naruszewicz, poet, historian and editor, Karol Wyrwicz, geographer, historian and educationalist, Franciszek Bohomolec, author of many ruthless satires about the excesses of the nobility and by I. Nagurczewski and J. Albertrandi. All these men belonged to the intellectual circle of the last king of Poland, Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski. Following the First Partition of Poland in 1772 which \\"sanctioned\\" a land grab by the Habsburg Monarchy, the Ossoli≈Ñski estates found themselves in the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria. Apart from administering the family estates and the occasional trips to Warsaw, Jozef gave himself over to literary pursuits. The Austrians soon awarded him the title of Count. In 1785 he married a relative, Countess Teresa Jab≈Çonowska. The marriage was childless and came to an end in 1791. Between 1789 and 1793 he sat on a committee reviewing the administrative constitution of Galicia to little effect. At the same time he was head of a delegation (1790-1793) to Leopold II, Margrave of Austria. In 1792 He travelled around Central Europe, taking in: Saxony, Bavaria, Austria, Czech lands and Moravia. In 1793 he spent some time in Vienna where he frequented Austrian minister, Thugut, which enabled him to be an intermediary between the Austrian government and members of the Kosciuszko Insurrection (1794). At that time he supported a patriotic Polish daily newspaper in Lw√≥w, \\"Dziennik Patriotycznych Polak√≥w\\" (1792-1798), and lobbied on behalf of imprisoned Polish activists who numbered Hugo Ko≈Ç≈ÇƒÖtaj among them. After the Third Partition of Poland (1795) the occupying powers intensified their policies of germanisation and russification closing down native educational establishments, cultural centres and introducing the invader's language into all administrative matters. The greatest loss for Polish culture were the wholesale deportations to Russia of magnificent Polish cultural collections such as the Za≈Çuski Library. In the circumstances a number of leading lights in Poland determined to create a national library collection. They included Adam K. Czartoryski of Pu≈Çawy, Tadeusz Czacki of Krzemieniec and J√≥zef Maksymilian Ossoli≈Ñski. Samuel Bogumi≈Ç Linde To this end from 1794 Ossoli≈àski hired the services of the German, intellectual and bibliographer, Samuel Linde.Neue Deutsche Biographie In the years he spent with Ossoli≈Ñski he gathered sufficient material for a Polish lexicon, for which he consulted widely in Polish and Slav sources in the count's own collection and benefitted from his mentoring. As a result Linde's fame prospered so that in 1804 he was appointed headmaster of the Warsaw Lyceum. From 1795 Ossoli≈Ñski settled permanently in Vienna where he devoted himself to research and his passion for books. In that period he began collecting materials on a grand scale for his projected national cultural foundation. In 1808 he was nominated as clandestine consultant to the Austrian court and the following year he became prefect of the Imperial Library, which he successfully defended from looting by Napoleon's invading army. He spent 15 years (1808-1823) as curator of the Galician Economic Institute. He was granted the distinction of Royal Marshall by Emperor Francis I of Austria and honoured with the Order of St Stephen of Hungary and Court Bursar of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria. From 1800 he was a member of the Society of Friends of Science in Warsaw, the Warsaw Scientific Society, the Wilno Academy, the Krak√≥w Academy, the Royal Societies in Prague and G√∂ttingen, the Imperial Royal Society in Vienna, the University of Vilna and the Moravian- Silesian Agricultural Society. The University of Lwow gave him an Honorary doctorate in philosophy in 1820. The Ossolineum Library converted by J√≥zef Bem from the former church of St Agnes Ossoli≈Ñski acquired the former Carmelite convent and church in Lwow along with the ruin that was St Agnes' church. A few months later he persuaded Emperor Francis to issue him with a statute for his foundation 8 May 1817. The principal provider of books to Ossoli≈Ñski was the Lwow bookseller, Karol Wild. In his highly complicated act of foundation, Ossoli≈Ñski laid down the staffing and financial arrangements and made express provision for the publication of a newsletter to report on the scientific progress of the institute. In 1823 Ossoli≈Ñski agreed with prince Henryk Lubomirski that he should donate his collections to the new library, but as a distinct museum collection. Abstract in English In 1820 his health failed badly and in 1823 he lost his sight. He died after a long illness in Vienna in March 1826. His grave has disappeared as it was in the part of the Matzleinsdorf Protestant Cemetery that was given up for road building. In 1826 the Galician assembly entrusted Gwalbert Pawlikowski, secretary to the Vienna court, with the task of adopting and cataloguing of Ossoli≈Ñski's collections in Vienna which he achieved in 10 months and despatched to Lwow. The 52 enormous crates contained 10, 121 works in 19, 055 volumes, plus various journals 567 manuscripts 133 maps and 1445 etchings.  Writing  = Selected works in Polish = * \\"My Age\\", Wiek m√≥j.

Thus, neither a budget deficit nor a budget surplus exists (the accounts \\"balance\\"). More generally, it is a budget that has no budget deficit, but could possibly have a budget surplus. A cyclically balanced budget is a budget that is not necessarily balanced year- to-year, but is balanced over the economic cycle, running a surplus in boom years and running a deficit in lean years, with these offsetting over time. Balanced budgets and the associated topic of budget deficits are a contentious point within academic economics and within politics. Many economists argue that moving from a budget deficit to a balanced budget decreases interest rates, increases investment, shrinks trade deficits and helps the economy grow faster in the longer term.  Economic views  Mainstream economics mainly advocates a cyclic balanced budget, arguing from the perspective of Keynesian economics that permitting the deficit to vary provides the economy with an automatic stabilizer‚Äîbudget deficits provide fiscal stimulus in lean times, while budget surpluses provide restraint in boom times. Keynesian economics does not advocate for fiscal stimulus when the existing government debt is already significant. Alternative currents in the mainstream and branches of heterodox economics argue differently, with some arguing that budget deficits are always harmful, and others arguing that budget deficits are not only beneficial, but also necessary. Schools which often argue against the effectiveness of budget deficits as cyclical tools include the freshwater school of mainstream economics and neoclassical economics more generally, and the Austrian school of economics. Budget deficits are argued to be necessary by some within post-Keynesian economics, notably the chartalist school: :Larger deficits, sufficient to recycle savings out of a growing gross domestic product (GDP) in excess of what can be recycled by profit-seeking private investment, are not an economic sin but an economic necessity. Budget deficits can be calculated by subtracting the total planned expenditure from the total available budget. This will then show either a budget deficit (a negative difference) or a budget surplus (a positive difference).  Political views  = United States = In the United States, the fiscal conservatism movement believes that balanced budgets are an important goal. Every state other than Vermont has a balanced budget amendment, providing some form of ban on deficits, while the Oregon kicker bans surpluses of greater than 2% of revenue. The Colorado Taxpayer Bill of Rights (the TABOR amendment) also bans surpluses, and requires the state to refund taxpayers in event of a budget surplus. = Sweden = Following the over-borrowing in both the public and private sector that led to the Swedish banking crisis of the early 1990s and under influence from a series of reports on the future demographic challenges, a wide political consensus developed on fiscal prudence. In the year 2000 this was enshrined in a law that stated a goal of a surplus of 2% over the business cycle, to be used to pay off the public debt and to secure the long-term future for the cherished welfare state. Today the goal is 1% over the business cycle, as the retirement pension is no longer considered a government expenditure. = United Kingdom = In 2015 George Osborne, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, announced that he intended to implement a law whereby the government must deliver a budget surplus if the economy is growing. Academics have criticised this proposal with Cambridge University professor Ha-Joon Chang saying the chancellor was turning a blind eye to the complexities of a 21st-century economy that demanded governments remain flexible and responsive to changing global events. Since 1980 there have only been six years when a budget surplus has been delivered, twice whilst the Conservative's John Major was Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1988 and 1989 and four times whilst Labour's Gordon Brown was Chancellor, in 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001. Balanced budget multiplier Because of the multiplier effect, it is possible to change aggregate demand (Y) keeping a balanced budget. Suppose the government increases its expenditures (G), balancing the increase by an increase in taxes (T). Since only part of the income taken away from households would have actually been spent, the change in consumption expenditure will be smaller than the change in taxes. Therefore, the net change in spending (increased government spending and decreased consumption spending) at this point is positive, and the induced second and subsequent rounds of spending are also positive, giving a positive result for the balanced budget multiplier. In general and in the absence of induced changes in interest rates and the price level, a change in the balanced budget will change aggregate demand by an amount equal to the change in spending. Let the consumption function be :C = c_0 + c_1 \\\\left ( Y - T \\\\right ). The goods market equilibrium equation is :Y=C+I+G+NX where I is exogenous physical investment and NX is net exports. Using the first equation in the second one yields the following solution for Y: :Y= \\\\frac {1} {1 - c_1} \\\\left ( c_0 + I + G+NX - c_1 T \\\\right ), and taking differences of the variables and setting \\\\Delta I=\\\\Delta NX=0 and \\\\Delta T=\\\\Delta G, we have :\\\\Delta Y=\\\\frac{1}{1-c_1}(\\\\Delta G -c_1 \\\\Delta G )=\\\\Delta G. Then dividing through by \\\\Delta G gives the balanced budget multiplier as :\\\\frac{\\\\Delta Y}{\\\\Delta G}\\\\vert_{\\\\Delta T=\\\\Delta G}=1. This is named the Haavelmo theorem which demonstrates that the balanced budget multiplier rises its maximum value when any increase of the public spending \\\\Delta G is corresponded by an equal increase of the fiscal imposition \\\\Delta T, so as to avoid a higher level of public debt. The deficit spending, that is the growth of public spending without an equal amount of monetary entrance into the State Treasury, is always a less efficient political choice in order to speed up the GNP. However, the balanced budget is made smaller when resulting changes in the interest rate change investment spending and money demand and when resulting changes in the price level affect money demand.

The Andover was named after the Avro Andover, a biplane transport used by the RAF for medical evacuation between the first and second world wars; and RAF Andover, where some of its trials were carried out. The Andover had a kneeling landing gear to make ramp loading easier. Design and development At the start of the 1960s the Royal Air Force (RAF) issued a requirement for a medium tactical freighter. Avro started work on a military variant of the Rolls-Royce Dart-powered twin- engined Avro 748 airliner. Handley Page also proposed a variant of the Handley Page Herald. Both types were tested by the Air Force in February 1962 at Martlesham Heath in Suffolk. A prototype Avro 748 Srs 2 was used for the trials. The RAF decided to order a military variant of the 748, designated the Avro 780; and the original Avro 748 prototype was modified with an upswept rear fuselage and rear loading ramp as the Avro 748MF, to test the military version. It had more powerful Dart Mk 301s engines and a unique kneeling landing gear. In April 1963, the RAF ordered 31 aircraft as the Andover C.1 by the RAF. The 748MF first flew from Woodford Aerodrome on 21 December 1963. The aircraft had larger four-bladed propellers than the 748, which required a greater distance between the engines and the fuselage, although the wingtips were reduced by 18 inches to maintain the same wingspan as the 748. A dihedral tailplane was also fitted to keep it clear of the propeller slipstream. The first production Andover C.1 flew from Woodford on 9 July 1965 and the first four aircraft were used for trials and tests with Hawker Siddeley and the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment at Boscombe Down. Following a release to service in May 1966, the fifth production aircraft was delivered to No. 46 Squadron RAF at RAF Abingdon in June 1966. Subsequent RAF types are the Andover CC.2 VIP transport and Andover E.3 electronic calibration aircraft. Operational history Andover C.1 of 46 Squadron RAF in 1971 Andover CC.2 of 60 Squadron RAF in 1987 The Andover C.1 was flown for the first time on 9 July 1965 and the first four examples were flown to RAF Boscombe Down for acceptance trials that year. The full contract of 31 aircraft were delivered to squadrons in Transport Command. These were No. 46 Squadron RAF at RAF Abingdon and later RAF Thorney Island, No. 52 Squadron RAF at RAF Seletar (Far East) and No. 84 Squadron RAF at RAF Sharjah (Middle East).Jefford There was a follow-on order placed with Hawker Siddeley for six aircraft as the CC.2, a version of the standard HS 748, and these went initially to 21 Squadron at RAF Khormaksar. The squadron had these for six months before being disbanded; the aircraft went to 32 Squadron at RAF Northolt, the Metropolitan Communications Squadron. The aircraft were with 32 Squadron for over 18 years, including some time spent on detachment at RAF Bruggen (Germany). Three of the RAF Andovers continued to fly into the second decade of the 21st century, a C.1 with the Empire Test Pilots' School and one C.1 with the Heavy Aircraft Test Squadron of the Joint Test and Evaluation Group. The remaining aircraft was a modified C.1 converted for photo- reconnaissance, the Andover C.1(PR), serial number XS596; the UK-named aircraft under the Treaty on Open Skies; all three were based at RAF Boscombe Down. The Royal New Zealand Air Force operated ten aircraft from 1976, acquired from the RAF while still relatively new. These saw service with UN missions to Somalia and on the Iran-Iraq border and in disaster-relief work in the Pacific. The type was retired from service in 1998. The main difficulty with the Andover's service in New Zealand was its limited range‚Äî of Pacific Ocean separates New Zealand from its nearest neighbours. New Zealand's Andovers were purchased to replace the Bristol Freighter which had even shorter range. Variants ;Avro 748MF :Prototype Avro 748 converted to military prototype which included an upswept rear fuselage and rear loading ramp and unique kneeling landing gear. ;Andover C.1 :First production series for RAF, 31 aircraft built. ;Andover C.1(PR) :Two C1 aircraft was converted for Photographic Reconnaissance duties. ;Andover CC.2 :Not a variant of the cargo/transport Andover but a VIP transport version of the HS 748. ;Andover E.3 / E.3A :Seven C.1 aircraft were converted for radio and airport nav aid calibration. Four aircraft were equipped with an inertial referenced flight inspection system (IRFIS) and were designated E3. The other three aircraft didn't have this equipment installed, and were designated E3A.

An enthusiastic traveler, his work is filled with depictions of nature and a certain sexual energy that is shared with his contemporary Octavio Paz. Biography The young Pellicer studied in Mexico City. In August 1921, along with Vicente Lombardo Toledano, Diego Rivera, Jos√© Clemente Orozco and Xavier Guerrero, he founded the Grupo Solidario del Movimiento Obrero (\\"Solidarity Group of the Workers' Movement\\"). He lectured in modern poetry at the National Autonomous University of Mexico and served as the director of the Department of Fine Arts. He helped establish a number of museums, including the Frida Kahlo and Anahuacalli museums in Mexico City. There is a small archeology museum named for Carlos Pellicer in Tepoztl√°n, Morelos. In 1976 he was elected to the Senate, representing Tabasco for the PRI. His early poems, as in Colores en el mar (Colors in the Sea, 1921) and Piedra de sacrificios (Stone of Sacrifice, 1924), often depicted serene and halcyon landscapes. During his later period, however, Pellicer explored the historical and spiritual implications of his experience of nature. Octavio Paz said of his work: \\"A great poet, Pellicer taught to us to see the world through different eyes, and in doing so modified Mexican poetry. His work, poetry with a plurality of sorts, is solved in a luminous metaphor, an interminable praise of the world.\\" References Category:1897 births Category:1977 deaths Category:20th-century Mexican poets Category:20th-century Mexican male writers Category:Mexican male poets Category:Writers from Tabasco Category:People from Villahermosa Category:Academics of the National Conservatory of Music of Mexico ","title":"Carlos Pellicer"},{"id":"1898047","text":"The World Economic Forum's Networked Readiness Index (NRI), also referred to as Technology Readiness, measures the propensity for countries to exploit the opportunities offered by information and communications technology (ICT). It is published in collaboration with INSEAD, as part of their annual Global Information Technology Report (GITR). The report is regarded as the most authoritative and comprehensive assessment of how ICT impacts the competitiveness and well-being of nations. The Networked Readiness Index (NRI) was first published in 2002 and provided a holistic framework for assessing the multi-faceted impact of ICT on society and the development of nations. Until 2016, the NRI was part of the Global Information Technology Report (GITR) published by the World Economic Forum (WEF), Cornell University and INSEAD. Under the World Economic Forum, the Networked Readiness Index (NRI), also referred to as Technology Readiness, was published as part of the‚Äô ‚ÄòGlobal Information Technology Report (GITR). In 2019, due to some internal reorganizations and changed priorities, the WEF handed over the production of the NRI to its original editors Soumitra Dutta and Bruno Lanvin. This provided an excellent opportunity for the NRI framework to be revisited and make it more future-ready. Within this opportunity, the editors also changed the name of the index from the Networked Readiness Index to Network Readiness Index. In the 2019 edition, the NRI was reviewed to include 4 pillars: Technology, People, Governance, and Impact. In 2019 the NRI was published by Portulans Institute, co-founded by Soumitra Dutta, Bruno Lanvin and Carolina Rossini. The report is regarded as the most authoritative and comprehensive assessment of how ICT impacts the competitiveness and well-being of nations. The index was originally developed by the Information Technology Group, which worked at Harvard University's Center for International Development until 2002. It seeks to better understand the impact of ICT on the competitiveness of nations and is a composite of three components: *the environment for ICT offered by a given country or community (market, political, regulatory, and infrastructure environment)l *the readiness of the country's key stakeholders (individuals, businesses, and governments) to use ICT *the usage of ICT among these stakeholders.  The 2019 Network Readiness Index  The Network Readiness Index 2019 ranks a total of 121 economies. A total of 62 indicators have been identified for the NRI 2019. Of these indicators, 40 are hard/quantitative data, 12 are index/composite indicator data, and 10 are survey/qualitative data. The renewed NRI of 2019 has an improved structure that incorporates several features not included in the most recent model used for the index. This year's results are therefore not entirely comparable with the rankings of previous editions. Nevertheless, the fundamental basis of the NRI is unchanged and, the rankings of NRI 2019 bear many resemblances to the results of NRI 2016. In fact, eight of this year's top 10 countries featured in the top 10 in NRI 2016. The two top 10 countries in this year's index that did not feature in the previous rankings‚Äô top 10 are Denmark (11th in NRI 2016; 4th in NRI 2019) and Germany (15th in NRI 2016; 10th in NRI 2019). # Sweden # Singapore # Netherlands # Norway # Switzerland # Denmark # Finland # United States # Germany # United Kingdom Global Information Technology Report 2016 The 2016 edition covers 139 nations.Global Information Technology Report 2016 (pdf) The top 10 are: # # # # # # # # # # Global Information Technology Report 2015 The 2015 edition covers 143 nations.Global Information Technology Report 2015 (pdf) The top 10 are: # # # # # # # # # # References  External links  * Report Website * Global Information Technology Report 2016 * Global Information Technology Report 2015 * Networked Readiness Index Rankings 2014 * Networked Readiness Index Rankings 2013 * Networked Readiness Index Rankings 2011-2012 * Networked Readiness Index Rankings 2009-2010 (PDF) * Networked Readiness Index Rankings 2008-2009 (PDF) * Networked Readiness Index Rankings 2007-2008 (PDF) * Networked Readiness Index Rankings 2006-2007 (PDF) * Networked Readiness Index Rankings 2005 * Networked Readiness Index Rankings 2004 (PDF) * Information Technology Group at Harvard University Category:Global economic indicators Category:Index numbers Category:IT infrastructure ","title":"Networked Readiness Index"},{"id":"1898061","text":"Jan Cornelisz Rijp (‚Äì) was a Dutch mariner in the late-16th and early-17th centuries.

After discovering Spitsbergen, the ships encountered pack ice blocking the way. Barents decided to turn east and round the northern tip of Novaya Zemlya, as he had successfully managed once before. When Barents urged Rijp to follow, he refused. Rijp insisted that the northern tip of Novaya Zemlya was far too dangerous and returned to the Netherlands.Ein hei√ües Bad in der Eisw√ºste in Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitungvom 2. Oktober 2011, Seiten 60 und 62 Barents and his ship continued in the attempt to round Novaya Zemlya. He realized too late the wisdom of Rijp's decision and became trapped in the ice. Barents perished at sea in one of the two small tenders the crew used to escape to the Kola Peninsula, unlike Rijp, who correctly assessed the risks of the Arctic and returned to pick up the remainder of Barents' crew‚Äîincluding van Heemskerk‚Äînear Murmansk on his next trip in 1597. Rijpsburg settlement on Svalbard is named for him.

It sells auto, home, motorcycle, and renters insurance direct to consumers online and by phone. Its primary competitors are other direct personal insurance writers, mainly GEICO and Progressive. Founded in 1999, the company was purchased by Allstate in 2011, and is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Allstate. History Esurance was founded in 1999 by Jean-Bernard Duler, Jeffrey L. Goodman, Huyen Bui, David Griffin, and Charles Wallace, and became one of the first insurance companies to sell policies directly to consumers over the internet, instead of using in-person meetings or phone calls. In 2000, Esurance was acquired by Folksamerica Holding Company, a subsidiary of White Mountains Insurance Group. Esurance, which is based out of San Francisco, had by that time expanded to offering policies in 24 states, but had also just laid off staff and was actively soliciting a purchaser. In 2004, Esurance began to offer multi-car discount packages to same-sex couples, by offering multi-car discounts to any group of people that lived together. The company claims to be one of the first insurers to have offered such packages to same- sex couples. In May 2011, Allstate announced that it was purchasing Esurance and rate-comparison site Answer Financial for approximately $1 billion. At the time, Esurance was selling policies in 30 states and was in the midst of a five-year growth period that saw them double the number of policies in force. Allstate, for its part, was losing policy holders to the three major online policy retailers: Esurance, Progressive, and GEICO. Allstate's acquisition of Esurance was completed in October of that year. The combined company became the sixth-largest provider of auto insurance policies. In September 2012, White Mountains filed a lawsuit against Allstate alleging that Allstate failed to meet a deadline to produce a financial audit that was part of the sale, and that Allstate deducted $5.2 million in legal expenses from the value of the sale that they were not allowed to deduct by the terms of the agreement. Esurance's first television advertising campaign was launched five years after the company went live. The campaign was aimed at the 18 to 24-year-old male demographic, and had a budget of $60,000, a tiny fraction of the over $1 billion spent on advertisements within the insurance industry. The commercials featured an animated character named Erin Esurance, a pink-haired spy inspired by Sydney Bristow from the television show Alias. The character and campaign were initially well received, leading to over 30 separate advertisements featuring Erin, and a dramatic increase in brand awareness. However, by 2009 industry polling on corporate mascots found Erin had become unpopular with viewers; 30% of viewers found the character annoying - double the industry average - and was below industry average in sincerity and believability. Polling found Erin was less popular than even Microsoft's notorious Clippy character. Additionally, a large number of pornographic images featuring Erin were created, and in some cases sold, by fans of the character. The illustrations became so prevalent that when the character was searched for by name without mature content filters enabled, the vast majority of results were pornographic. The combination of decreasing popularity and the pornographic images led to the character being retired by 2010. After Erin was discontinued in 2010, Esurance launched a new advertising campaign designed by the firm Duncan/Channon. By this point, the company had an advertising budget of $100 million. Set in a fictionalized version of the Esurance office, but featuring actual Esurance employees (although Erin Esurance makes a background appearance) the commercials emphasized both the company's high tech platform and the personal touches offered by speaking to employees. The campaign was a deliberate break from focusing the advertisements on the 18-24 male demographic. The new campaign was short lived; In December 2011, Esurance announced another new advertising campaign. It emphasized efficiency and positioned the company as \\"Insurance for the Modern World\\"; the target demographic was families and professionals in the 25-49 age group. John Krasinski narrated the commercials, which were developed by ad agency Leo Burnett Worldwide. Esurance also markets itself heavily through sports teams and sporting events, where it casts itself as being more environmentally friendly than competitors. The company has sponsored a number of sporting events and teams, including the US Open tennis tournament, the Golden State Warriors, and the San Francisco Giants. In February 2015, Esurance released their Super Bowl XLIX commercial, featuring Bryan Cranston parodying his Walter White character from Breaking Bad. In April 2015, Esurance and Major League Baseball announced a new multi-year sponsorship in which Esurance will be the exclusive auto insurance partner for Major League Baseball. Esurance introduced a new ad campaign featuring Dennis Quaid (in his first-ever appearance in a commercial, and the company's first use of a real-life spokesman) as a tongue-in-cheek \\"highly likeable\\" spokesperson in August 2018. The company introduced a new slogan, \\"surprisingly painless,\\" as part of the rebrand. In December 2019, Allstate aimed to close down Esurance in 2020 for business operations streamlining. In April 2020, Allstate announced that a 15% refund will be forwarded to clients of Esurance due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The sensation can feel like it goes up or down the spine. In many people, it is elicited by bending the head forward. It can also be evoked when a practitioner pounds on the cervical spine while the neck is flexed; this is caused by involvement of the posterior columns. Lhermitte phenomenon is named for French neurologist Jean Lhermitte. Associated conditions The sign suggests a lesion or compression of the upper cervical spinal cord or lower brainstem‚Äîusually dorsal columns of the cervical cord or caudal medulla. Although often considered a classic finding in multiple sclerosis, it can be caused by a number of conditions, including transverse myelitis, Beh√ßet disease, osteogenesis imperfecta, trauma, radiation myelopathy, vitamin B12 deficiency (subacute combined degeneration), compression of the spinal cord in the neck from any cause such as cervical spondylosis, disc herniation, tumor, and Arnold‚ÄìChiari malformation. Lhermitte's sign may also appear during or following high-dose chemotherapy. Irradiation of the cervical spine may also evoke it as an early delayed radiation injury, which occurs within 4 months of radiation therapy. Delayed onset Lhermittes sign has been reported following head and/or neck trauma. This occurs ~2 1/2 months following injury, without associated neurological symptoms or pain, and typically resolves within 1 year. This sign is also sometimes seen as part of a \\"discontinuation syndrome\\" associated with certain psychotropic medications, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, particularly paroxetine and venlafaxine. Typically, it only occurs after having taken the medication for some duration, and then stopped or withdrawn rapidly or after administering reduced dose. Fluoxetine, given its very long half-life, can be given as a single small dose, and often avoid Lhermitte's sign and other withdrawal symptoms. In the dental field, three studies (Layzer 1978, Gutmann 1979, Blanco 1983) have identified Lhermitte sign among nitrous oxide abusers. This is likely due to nitrous oxide depletion of vitamin B12 leading to a very severe, rapid deficiency in the absence of supplementation. Terminology Lhermitte sign is not attributed to its discoverer. It was first described by Pierre Marie and Chatelin in 1917. Jean Lhermitte, a French neurologist and neuropsychiatrist, did not publish his first report until 1920. However, in 1924 he did publish the seminal article on the subject which resulted in it becoming well known. Given that Lhermitte's sign is named for Lhermitte, it is incorrect to spell the term as \\"L'hermitte's sign\\". This holds true for all other named signs or diseases that the discoverers last name does not end in \\"s\\" or had the disease themselves.

The specific ramifications of these depend on the locale in question. Nuclear-free zones usually neither address nor prohibit radiopharmaceuticals used in nuclear medicine even though many of them are produced in nuclear reactors. They typically do not prohibit other nuclear technologies such as cyclotrons used in particle physics. Several sub-national authorities worldwide have declared themselves \\"nuclear- free\\". However, the label is often symbolic, as nuclear policy is usually determined and regulated at higher levels of government: nuclear weapons and components may traverse nuclear-free zones via military transport without the knowledge or consent of local authorities which had declared nuclear-free zones. Palau became the first nuclear-free nation in 1980. New Zealand was the first Western-allied nation to legislate towards a national nuclear free zone by effectively renouncing the nuclear deterrent. Nuclear-free zone by geographical areas =Australia= Many Australian local government areas of Australia have passed anti-nuclear weaponry legislation; notable among these are Brisbane, capital of Queensland, which has been nuclear weapon free since 1983, and the South and North Sydney councils. However the passage of such legislation is generally considered just a symbolic measure. The majority of councils which have passed anti-nuclear weaponry legislation are members of the Australian Nuclear Free Zones and Toxic Industries Secretariat which has 44 member councils. =Austria= Austria is a nuclear free zone, when a nuclear power station was built during the 1970s at Zwentendorf, Austria, start-up was prevented by a popular vote in 1978. The completed power plant is now marketed as a shooting location for film and television.Zwentendorf ‚Äì location On July 9, 1997, the Austrian Parliament voted unanimously to maintain the country's anti-nuclear policy. Ironically, the headquarters of the International Atomic Energy Agency is located in Vienna, and the IAEA maintains nuclear laboratories both in Vienna and Seibersdorf. The IAEA has also established programs to assist nuclear energy projects in developing countries. Austria's anti-nuclear stance also causes tension with its nuclear neighbors. Vienna is located close to the Czech reactor at Temelin, and four reactors are being built in neighboring Slovakia and two in neighboring Hungary. Austria also draws from regional electricity grids, meaning it imports nuclear power, although chancellor Werner Faymann has pledged to eliminate Austria's reliance on foreign power by 2015.Nucl√©aire: l'Autriche se d√©branche d√®s 2015 =Canada= Vancouver is a nuclear weapons free city. Victoria, British Columbia is also a nuclear weapons free city. This has caused problems as nearby Esquimalt houses CFB Esquimalt, Canada's Pacific naval base, which is used frequently by the United States Navy. The USN routinely sends ships or aircraft carriers loaded with nuclear weapons to Esquimalt. As a result, the ships are forced to dock out of the city limits as not to violate the city by-laws.The policy does not limit operations at TRIUMF, Canada's national laboratory for nuclear and particle physics at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver. The province of British Columbia also bans mining for uranium, and the construction of nuclear power plants within its territorial limits.EnergyBC: Nuclear Power Nanaimo, British Columbia, Kitimat, British Columbia; Red Deer, Alberta, and Regina, Saskatchewan are also nuclear weapons-free cities. =Former Soviet Union= Central Asia All states of Central Asia have signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and signed the Central Asian Nuclear Weapon Free Zone treaty. Thus, there are no technologies to create a weapon or enrich the particles, but in Tajikistan, during the Soviet Union, such initiatives were brought to life, but with the collapse of the Soviet Union, the facilities were dismantled and moved to the Russian Federation. The Treaty came into force on 21 March 2009. Estonia After Estonia seceded from the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, Estonia became a nuclear-free country. The two land-based nuclear reactors at the Soviet Navy nuclear submarine training centre in Paldiski were removed when Russia finally relinquished control of the nuclear reactor facilities in September 1995. There are no nuclear power stations in Estonia. =Japan= Nuclear-free Kobe Port, seen from Po-ai Shiosai Park in 2011 As a resource-poor nation, Japan is heavily reliant on nuclear power, but its unique experience in World War II has led to the wholesale rejection of nuclear weapons, holding nuclear weapons shall not be manufactured in, possessed by, or allowed entry into Japan. These tenets, known as the Three Non-Nuclear Principles, were first stated by Prime Minister Eisaku Sat≈ç in 1967, and were adopted as a parliamentary resolution in 1971, though they have never formally been entered into law. They continue to reflect the attitudes of both government and the general public, who remain staunchly opposed to the manufacture or use of nuclear weapons. The Japan Self-Defense Forces have never made any attempt to manufacture or otherwise obtain nuclear arms, and no nuclear weapons are known to have been introduced into the Japanese Home Islands since the end of World War II. While the United States does not maintain nuclear bases within its military installations on the Home Islands, it is believed to have once stored weapons at Okinawa, which remained under US administrative jurisdiction until 1972. =Italy= Italy is a nuclear free zone since the Italian nuclear power referendum of November 1987. Following center-right parties' victory in the 2008 election, Italy's industry minister announced that the government scheduled the construction to start the first new Italian nuclear-powered plant by 2013. The announced project was paused in March 2011, after the Japanese earthquake, and scrapped after a referendum on 12‚Äì13 June 2011. =New Zealand= In 1984, Prime Minister David Lange barred nuclear-powered or nuclear-armed ships from using New Zealand ports or entering New Zealand waters. Under the New Zealand Nuclear Free Zone, Disarmament, and Arms Control Act 1987,New Zealand Nuclear Free Zone, Disarmament, and Arms Control Act 1987Nuclear Free Zone territorial sea and land of New Zealand became nuclear weapons and nuclear-powered ship free zones. It does not ban nuclear power stations. A research reactor was operated by the University of Canterbury until 1981. Official planning for a nuclear power station continued until the 1980s. A nuclear reactor provided electricity for McMurdo Station, in the New Zealand Antarctic Territory from 1962‚Äì1972. The Act prohibits \\"entry into the internal waters of New Zealand 12 miles (22.2 km) radius by any ship whose propulsion is wholly or partly dependent on nuclear power\\" and bans the dumping of radioactive waste within the nuclear-free zone, as well as prohibiting any New Zealand citizen or resident \\"to manufacture, acquire, possess, or have any control over any nuclear explosive device.\\"New Zealand Nuclear Free Zone Extension Bill ‚Äì Green Party Combined with the firm policy of the United States to \\"neither confirm nor deny\\" whether particular naval vessels carry nuclear weapons (a \\"policy of deliberate ambiguity\\"), the Act effectively bars these ships from entering New Zealand waters. New Zealand's security treaty with the United States, ANZUS, did not mention nuclear deterrence and did not require unconditional port access. However, after New Zealand refused entry to USS Buchanan in 1985, the United States government suspended its ANZUS obligations to New Zealand, seeing New Zealand's effective rejection of United States Navy vessels as voiding the treaty. The Lange Labour government did not see their stance as incompatible with the treaty and sought a compromise for over two years before passing the Act. Support for the non-nuclear policy was bolstered by the perceived over-reaction of the United States and by the sinking of the Rainbow Warrior by French spies while docked in Auckland. According to some commentators, the legislation was a milestone in New Zealand's development as a nation and seen as an important act of sovereignty, self-determination and cultural identity.Nuclear threat continues to grow, New Zealand warns on anniversary of anti-nuclear law ‚Äì International Herald Tribune New Zealand‚Äôs three decade anti-nuclear campaign is the only successful movement of its type in the world which resulted in the nation's nuclear-free zone status being enshrined in legislation. The nuclear-free zone law does not make building land-based nuclear power plants illegal. However, the relatively small electricity system, abundance of other resources to generate electricity, and public opposition has meant a nuclear power plant has never gone beyond the investigation phase ‚Äì a nuclear power plant was proposed north of Auckland in the early 1970s, but the discovery of large natural gas reserves in Taranaki saw the proposal shelved. =Nordic countries= Nuclear weapons-free Nordic (Finn. Ydinaseeton Pohjola) was an initiative by the President of Finland Urho Kekkonen for a nuclear weapons-free zone in the Nordic countries. The aim was to prevent the Nordic countries from becoming a nuclear battleground and a route for cruise missiles in the event of a nuclear war between the Soviet Union and NATO. Nuclear energy, however, is used in both Finland and Sweden. =Palau= Palau adopted its first constitution in July 1979, stating that the Micronesian country would be \\"nuclear-free\\". The United States told the Palauan government that this constitution was likely incompatible with the Compact of Free Association. The Palauan government submitted a revised version of the constitution without the \\"nuclear-free\\" clause the following October. The Palauan people rejected the revised document and reinstated the original constitution in July 1980. Seven years later, however, the Palauan people voted to overturn their nuclear-free status out of \\"economic survival\\". =United Kingdom= The Nuclear Free Zone Movement in the United Kingdom was very strong in early 1980s; up to two hundred local authorities including county councils, district councils and city councils such as the Greater London Council (GLC) (before its abolition) declared themselves to be 'nuclear free'. The first 'nuclear-free zone' in the UK was Manchester City Council in 1980 ‚Äì this still exists to this day. Wales became 'nuclear free' on 23 February 1982 after Clwyd County Council declared itself 'nuclear free' and the Nuclear Free Wales Declaration was made. This policy was legally underpinned by Section 137 of the Local Government Act, which allowed local authorities to spend a small amount on whatever members considered was in the interest of their area or a part of their area. UK nuclear-free local authorities refused to take part in civil defence exercises relating to nuclear war, which they thought were futile. The non-cooperation of the nuclear-free zone authorities was the main reason for the cancellation of the national 'Hard Rock' civil defence exercise in July 1982. In England and Wales 24 of the 54 county councils refused to participate and seven more co-operated only in a half-hearted way.Bolsover, Philip, \\"A victory ‚Äì and a new development\\", in Minnion, J., and Bolsover, P., The CND Story, London: Allison and Busby, 1983 This has been seen as a victory for the British Peace movement against the policies of Margaret Thatcher. Generally, nuclear-free zones were predominantly Labour Party controlled councils but Liberal Party and even a few Conservative Party councillors were often active in this respect too. =United States= A number of towns, cities and counties in the United States established themselves as Nuclear-Free Zones in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. The first was Missoula, Montana. In the November 1978 general election, Missoula voters overwhelmingly approved a ballot initiative in the form of a land-use ordinance establishing the entirety of Missoula County as a \\"'nuclear free' zoning district\\" banning all nuclear facilities except those for medical purposes. (In the same election, Montana voters approved a statewide initiative by a 2‚Äì1 margin barring nuclear facilities or reactors without strict state-enforced regulatory standards and ratification by popular referendum, and in a follow-up 1980 initiative, Montanans narrowly voted to ban the disposal of nuclear waste.) That Missoula's measure was originally drafted as a zoning ordinance legally enforceable by the county planning department apparently created the popular term \\"Nuclear Free Zone\\" adopted as the name of the local political action group sponsoring the initiative and later used by other jurisdictions worldwide.For more on the Missoula zoning ordinance, see Missoula Independent, Nov. 30, 2000, at: http://missoulanews.bigskypress.com/missoula/reading-the- sign/Content?oid=1133059. For the zoning ordinance text as updated in 2007, see Missoula County, MT Nuclear Free Zone, at: Subsequently, the tiny town of Garrett Park, Maryland, attracted worldwide attention with its referendum in May, 1982. The following year, Takoma Park, Maryland, was officially declared a nuclear-free zone in 1983 by then-mayor Sam Abbott. A citizen committee of the local city council continues to monitor city contracts. The city cannot hold contracts with any company associated with any aspect of nuclear weapons without a waiver from the citizen committee. In September 2005, Takoma Park took a stand against the transportation of high-level nuclear waste through the City. It voted to amend its Nuclear-Free Zone Ordinance to give its citizen committee responsibility to collect information and from this information and from consultations with individuals and organizations involved in the transportation of high-level nuclear waste, to advise the City on how to promote the safety and welfare of its citizens from harmful exposure to high-level nuclear waste.For more on Takoma Park's nuclear-free history see: Another well-known nuclear-free community is Berkeley, California, whose citizens passed the Nuclear Free Berkeley Act in 1986 which allows the city to levy fines for nuclear weapons-related activity and to boycott companies involved in the United States nuclear infrastructure. The City of Berkeley has posted signs at city limits proclaiming its nuclear free status. The ordinance specifies possible fines for such activities within its borders. The University of California, Berkeley is deeply involved in the history of nuclear weapons, and the University of California system until recently managed operations at Los Alamos National Laboratory, a U.S. nuclear weapons design laboratory, and continues to manage the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. At the time of the passage of the act, the University operated a nuclear reactor for research purposes, the Etcheverry Reactor, which it continued to operate after the act went into effect. The University of California, as a state institution, is not subject to Berkeley's municipal regulations, including the ban. Berkeley also has major freeway and train lines which are used in transporting nuclear materials. On November 14, 1984 the Davis, California City Council declared the city to be a nuclear-free zone.Nuclear Free Zone ‚Äì Davis Wiki Davis has major freeway and train arteries running through it which are used for transporting nuclear materials. The University of California, with a campus at Davis, runs a research reactor at the nearby former McClellan Air Force Base, as well as workers who are involved with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. On November 8, 1988 the city of Oakland, California passed \\"Measure T\\" with 57% of the vote, making that city a nuclear free zone. Under Ordinance No. 11062 CMS then passed on December 6, 1988, the city is restricted from doing business with \\"any entity knowingly engaged in nuclear weapons work and any of its agents, subsidiaries or affiliates which are engaged in nuclear weapons work.\\"Schedule P, City of Oakland, rev. 7/30/01 The measure was invalidated in federal court, on the grounds that it interfered with the Federal Government's constitutional authority over national defense and atomic energy.A Nuclear-Free Zone Is Ruled to Be Invalid, New York Times/AP, 4/28/90Guardian (US), 23 May 1990, p7, via WISE Nuclear Issues Information Service The issue being Oakland is a major port, and like Berkeley, and Davis, has major freeway and train arteries running through it.

Early life, family and career Born in Deltaville, Virginia, Jackson went west in 1880, settling in Pendleton, Oregon. There, he bought the Pendleton-based East Oregonian, becoming its publisher in 1882 and developing it into a successful regional paper. In 1886, Sam Jackson and the former Maria Clopton, also originally from Virginia, were married, in Pendleton. They had two sons, Francis C. and Philip L. Jackson, both born in Pendleton.  The Oregon Journal  In 1902, a group of influential Portlanders persuaded Jackson to sell the East Oregonian and move to Portland to revive the failing Portland Evening Journal. Under his direction, the latter was renamed first the Oregon Daily Journal and then simply The Oregon Journal. The Journal became successful as the main (Democratic-leaning) competitor to Portland's (Republican-leaning) daily paper, The Oregonian. In his first editorial at the helm of the paper, on July 23, 1902, Jackson declared that: > The Journal in head and heart will stand for the people, be truly Democratic > and free from political entanglements and machinations, believing in the > principles that promise the greatest good to the greatest number - to ALL > MEN, regardless of race, creed or previous condition of servitude.... It > shall be a FAIR newspaper and not a dull and selfish sheet - [and] a credit > to 'Where rolls the Oregon' country. Jackson led the Journal for 22 years as owner, publisher and editor, until his death in 1924. His son, Philip succeeded him, serving as publisher for 29 years, until his death at the age of 59, in 1953. Maria Jackson remained involved in the business until her death in 1956, at the age of 93. Honors and legacy C.S. \\"Sam\\" Jackson was inducted into the Oregon Newspaper Hall of Fame in 1979. In 1917, Jackson donated 88 acres (356,000 m¬≤) on Marquam Hill in Portland to the University of Oregon Medical School; the site, then known as Sam Jackson Park, is now the campus of the Oregon Health & Science University. The street serving it continues to be named SW Sam Jackson Park Road. Jackson Tower, former home of The Oregon Journal in downtown Portland, is named for him. In October 1960, four years after Maria Jackson's death, based on provisions in her will, The Jackson Foundation was established.The Jackson Foundation, \\"The Jackson Foundation: Founded by Maria C.

Diane co- founded the Walt Disney Family Museum alongside her family. She was president of the Board of Directors of the Walt Disney Family Foundation. The museum, which opened in 2009, was established to promote and inspire creativity and innovation and celebrate and study the life of Walt Disney. Disney legacy Disney family (1951) Miller was a patron of the arts, as well as a lifelong classical music enthusiast and a generous philanthropist . Miller published a series of eight pieces for the Saturday Evening Post in 1956 titled \\"My Dad, Walt Disney,\\" co-written with Pete Martin. In 1957 she published the book The Story of Walt Disney. After her husband was removed from his executive position at Walt Disney Productions in 1984, Miller began to limit her involvement with the company. In an interview with Diane in 2005, she recalled that she and Sharon lived a typical life, as both parents were very protective, caring and loving. Miller was instrumental in pushing ahead with the Walt Disney Concert Hall in downtown Los Angeles. The project was initiated with a $50 million gift from her mother in 1988, but was stalled for a time due to cost negotiations. She was an ardent supporter of architect Frank Gehry as its designer. The hall finally opened in 2004. After devoting her earlier life to raising her seven children, Miller undertook an active advocacy to document the life and accomplishments of her father, who she perceived to have been the subject of poorly researched biographies and inaccurate rumors. She was also concerned that his name had become more of a corporate identity than a reference to the man himself. In 2001, the Walt Disney Family Foundation released The Man Behind the Myth, a documentary film about Walt Disney's life featuring interviews with his colleagues, peers, and family. In 2009, Diane co-founded the Walt Disney Family Museum with her son Walter Elias Disney Miller, who is a movie producer, and Disney was also the President of the Board of Directors of the Walt Disney Family Foundation at the time of her death, which is a nonprofit organization that owns and operates the Walt Disney Family Museum, located in Presidio in San Francisco. In 2015, the inaugural Diane Disney Miller Lifetime Achievement Award was created to honor the Museum's founder, to recognize those who have made an outstanding impact in the field of arts, education, community involvement, or technological advancements. =Honorees= * 2015 - Richard Sherman * 2016 - Marty Sklar * 2017 - John Lasseter Personal life Born in Los Angeles on December 18, 1933, Diane Disney Miller attended Los Feliz Grammar School, before moving to Immaculate Heart High School (Los Angeles) for junior high school and high school.https://www.mouseplanet.com/10546/Remembering_Diane_Disney_Miller She went on to study English at the University of Southern California. When she was 20 years old, Diane was introduced to 21-year-old University of Southern California student Ron Miller, a member of the USC Trojans football team, on a blind date after a University of California‚ÄìUSC game. They married in a small Episcopal church ceremony in Santa Barbara on May 9, 1954. Together, Diane and Ron had seven children whom they were survived by: Christopher (b. 1954), Joanna (b. 1956), Tamara (b. 1957), Jennifer (later Miller-Goff; b. 1960), Walter (b. 1961), Ronald (b. 1963), and Patrick (b. 1967). Ronald then served in the Army and played professional football before Walt convinced him to work for the Walt Disney Studios, and ascended from film directing and production to president and CEO of what is now The Walt Disney Company. In 1988, Lillian Disney, her mother, announced plans to contribute $50 million to the Los Angeles Concert Hall in Downtown Los Angeles, which Diane would later come to support throughout her life. More than 70 architectural firms submitted proposals to the head director, Frank Gehry. By 1996, the project was almost dead, but Diane persuaded Gehry to move forward with it, despite problems with poor management and disagreements over the design, and Los Angeles County officials' attempts to cancel it. It was supposed to be worth $10 million by 1997. Diane arranged for the Walt Disney Family Foundation to contribute about $25 million to keep Gehry in control, and the hall finally opened in 2003, at the cost of $247 million. Although Lillian Disney died in 1997 and never saw a concert there, Diane continued to support the concert hall. During that time, Diane traveled to Napa Valley with her mother, Lillian, to visit several wineries. The trip inspired Miller to start a vineyard, with the possibility of a winery. With the children grown, Ron left the company and the entertainment industry in 1984, and both he and Diane went on to develop the renowned Silverado Vineyards Winery in Napa, which became their home. In 1976, the family purchased a large property along the Silverado Trail in the Stags Leap District. They planted Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay and started making wine in 1981. They expanded the winery to only using estate-grown grapes, and Diane helped create a home and a family-like atmosphere rather than just a business. Death and dedication Diane Disney Miller died on November 19, 2013, at age 79 from medical complications that developed after a fall. The film Saving Mr. Banks is dedicated to her memory; Miller died shortly before it opened theatrically. Ron and Diane Disney Miller received a special thank you in Inside Out (2015).

The mountains reach a height of . The Judean Mountains can be separated to a number of sub-regions, including the Mount Hebron ridge, the Jerusalem ridge and the Judean slopes. These mountains formed the heartland of the Kingdom of Judah, where the earliest Jewish settlements emerged. Geography The Judaean mountains are part of a more extended range that runs in a north-south direction. The ridge consists of the Samarian Hills in its northern part, and of the Judaean mountains in its southern part, the two segments meeting at the latitude of Ramallah. The westward descent from the hard limestone country of the Judaean mountains towards the coastal plain is by way of a longitudinal trough of fosse cut through chalk, followed by the low, rolling soft limestone hills of the Shephelah, while eastwards the landscape falls steeply towards the Jordan Rift Valley. The southern end of the mountain range is at BeershebaPalestine: Land, Encyclopaedia BritannicaJerusalem Hills - Mapcarta in the northern part of the Negev, where the mountains slope down into the Beersheba-Arad valley. The average height of the Judaean mountains is of , and they encompass the cities of Ramallah, Jerusalem, Bethlehem and Hebron. The northern section of the Judaean mountains is referred to as Jerusalem Hills, and the southern one as Hebron Hills. The Judaean Mountains were heavily forested in antiquity. The range is mostly composed of terra rossa soils over hard limestones. Geology and palaeonthology The Judaean Mountains are the surface expression of a series of monoclinic folds which trend north-northwest through Israel. The folding is the central expression of the Syrian Arc belt of anticlinal folding that began in the Late Cretaceous Period in northeast Africa and southwest Asia. The Syrian Arc extends east-northeast across the Sinai, turns north- northeast through Israel and continues the east-northeast trend into Syria. The Israeli segment parallels the Dead Sea Transform which lies just to the east. The uplift events that created the mountain occurred in two phases one in the Late Eocene-Early Oligocene and second in the Early Miocene. In prehistoric times, animals no longer found in the Levant region were found here, including elephants, rhinoceri, giraffes and wild Asian water buffalo. The range has karst topography including a stalactite cave in Nahal Sorek National Park between Jerusalem and Beit Shemesh and the area surrounding Ofra, where fossils of prehistoric flora and fauna were found. History In ancient times the Judean mountains were the allotment of the Tribe of Judah and the heartland of the former Kingdom of Judah. \\"In both the Idumaean and the Ituraean alliances, and in the annexation of Samaria, the Judaeans had taken the leading role.

It focuses on an author who suffers severe writer's block and delusions at an isolated lake house four years after the death of his wife. It won the Bram Stoker Award for Best Novel in 1998, and the British Fantasy Award for Best Novel in 1999. The book re-uses many basic plot elements of Daphne du Maurier's Rebecca, which is directly referenced several times in the book's opening pages; however, the relation of these elements (including a wife who is dead as the book opens, her posthumous effect on future romance, a drowning, and house haunted by the memories of previous inhabitants) to the plot and characters is markedly different. When the paperback edition of Bag of Bones was published by Pocket Books on June 1, 1999 (), it included a new author's note at the end of the book, in which Stephen King describes his initial three-book deal with Scribner (Bag of Bones, On Writing, and a collection of short stories titled One Headlight, which later became Everything's Eventual), and devotes most of the piece describing the origins of the then-forthcoming Hearts in Atlantis. Background information Stephen King had been publishing his books with Viking since The Dead Zone in 1979. In October 1997, after Viking published King's then-latest novel, Desperation (1996), and King's deal with Viking expired, it was being reported that King was seeking a large advance for his next novel ($17‚Äì18 million according to various reports) and 26% of gross sales, whereas his deal with Viking previously paid a $15 million advance per book. King also wanted to move to a more literary and prestigious publisher. Ultimately, King left Viking and on November 6, 1997 signed an initial three-book deal with Simon & Schuster, with a $2 million advance for Bag of Bones in addition to 50% profit-sharing. The novel, first reported to be a thousand pages but turned out to be nearly half that, was billed as \\"a haunted love story\\", and this phrase was printed on the back cover of the hardcover first edition, which had a print-run of 1.4 million copies. Plot summary The narrator, Mike Noonan, a bestselling novelist, suffers severe writer's block after his pregnant wife Jo suddenly dies due to a brain aneurysm. Four years later, Mike, still grieving, is plagued by nightmares set at his summer house in TR-90 (an unincorporated town named for its map coordinates), Maine. He decides to confront his fears and moves to his vacation house on Dark Score Lake, known as \\"Sara Laughs\\". On his first day, he meets Kyra, a 3-year-old girl and her young widowed mother, 20-year-old Mattie Devore. Mattie's father-in-law is Max Devore, an elderly rich man who will do anything to gain custody of his granddaughter, Kyra. Drawn to Kyra and Mattie, Mike hires John Storrow, a custody lawyer, for Mattie, and things start looking up. Mike begins to write again, and realizes that Jo's ghost is helping him to solve the mystery of Sara Tidwell, a blues singer whose ghost haunts the house. He also learns that Jo frequently returned to the town in the year before her death, without telling him. Mike begins having recurring, disturbing dreams and visions, and realizes he shares a psychic connection with Kyra. Max and his personal assistant, Rogette, try to drown Mike but he survives with the help of his wife's spirit. Max unexpectedly commits suicide that same night. Mike sees a pattern when he sees that local inhabitants have names that begin with \\"K\\" or \\"C\\" and learns how relatives of townspeople have drowned in childhood. While Storrow and the private detective he hired are celebrating the end of the custody battle, Mattie attempts to seduce Mike. As they are embracing, Mattie's trailer is subjected to a drive-by shooting, injuring Storrow and the detective and killing Mattie. The detective is able to kill the driver and incapacitate the shooter with Mike's help. Mike then grabs Kyra and drives back to his home. The shooter's buddies try to stop them, but refuse to follow him to \\"Sara Laughs\\". Under the influence of Sara's ghost, Mike is tormented to drown Kyra and commit suicide himself. Jo's ghost prevents him and calls his attention to the novel he has begun to write. In the pages there are clues that lead Mike to discover documents Jo had hidden, among them a genealogy showing Mike's blood relationship to one of the town families. Several families whose origin lay within the town had firstborn children with \\"K\\" names who were all murdered‚ÄîKyra, as a descendant of Max Devore, is scheduled to be the next to die. The genealogy also shows that Mike and Jo's child would have been the next firstborn child with a \\"K\\" name in the family line. Mike realizes this must be Sara Tidwell's curse for something that had been done to her. He leaves and searches for Sara's grave, stopped by the ghosts of several members of the old families. He learns in a vision that these men had viciously raped and killed Sara, and drowned her son Kito in the lake; all the \\"K\\" children who died were descendants of those men. Mike reaches Sara's grave and succeeds in destroying her bones, ending the curse. Upon returning to the house, Mike discovers that Rogette has kidnapped Kyra. He follows them to the lake, where Mattie's ghost appears and knocks Rogette into the water. Rogette tries to pull Mike in with her, but is impaled by wreckage from the dock. Mattie's ghost says her goodbyes to Mike and Kyra. The novel ends with an epilogue, revealing that Mike has retired from writing and is attempting to adopt Kyra. His status as a single, unrelated male complicates things, and the adoption has taken longer than anticipated. The outcome of the adoption is left unresolved at the end, but the reader is given hope that it will be positive. Reception The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction reviewer Charles de Lint declared Bag of Bones to be \\"a powerful, moving novel.\\"Books to Look For, F&SF;, February 1999 Elizabeth Hand praised it lavishly: \\"What is extraordinary here is how good the writing is. . . . The characterizations are plummy, the dialogue sharp, and even the ghosts play second fiddle to Mike Noonan and his genuinely anguished midlife crisis.\\"Books, F&SF;, May 1999 Awards * Bram Stoker Award winner for Best Novel in 1998 * British Fantasy Award winner for Best Novel in 1999 Audio version The audio version of Bag of Bones is noteworthy in several respects. Like most Stephen King books, the audio version is unabridged. It is read by Stephen King himself, one of several books he has read himself for audio version publication, including Hearts in Atlantis, Lunch at the Gotham Cafe, and In the Deathroom. Intermingled with the text are bits of music and a song sung by Sara Tidwell; this music and song were recorded specifically for the audio version of Bag of Bones. Finally, the audio version of this book includes an interview with Stephen King. Tenth Anniversary Edition A trade paperback edition was published in the fall of 2008, commemorating the tenth anniversary of the novel's release in 1998. It contained a Questions & Answers with Stephen King, along with \\"The Cat from Hell,\\" a short story from his then upcoming collection Just After Sunset. Film adaptation A 2 1/2 hour (approximately 4 hours with commercials) TV miniseries produced by Stewart Mackinnon and Mark Sennet, directed by Mick Garris and with teleplay by screenwriter Matt Venne aired on A&E; in December 2011. Irish actor Pierce Brosnan plays Mike Noonan, with Broadway actress Anika Noni Rose taking the role of Sara Tidwell. Filming took place in and around Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada in August and September 2011. The miniseries changes Sara's son Kito to a daughter named Kisha for unknown reasons, and there is no reference to the genealogy seen in the book, as Mike is well aware that his grandfather lived in Dark Score Lake, but was not aware of the fact that his grandfather had been one of the men who raped Sara. The ending of the miniseries was also changed. Jo confronts Sara while Mike works to destroy Sara and her daughter's bodies with lye and succeeds.

History After fulfilling his contractual obligations to Blanco y Negro in the UK and Sire/Reprise in the US, Mascis holed up in his home studio in Amherst, MA, which he named Bob's Place after his pet bulldog. Recording 99% of the instruments on the recordings, he emerged from the studio with the first J Mascis + The Fog album, More Light, an album title inspired by Mascis's growing interest in \\"hugging saint\\" Ammachi. One of the pivotal songs on the album, \\"Ammaring\\", is also about Ammachi. Mascis signed with Artemis Records to release the album. To promote More Light, Mascis enlisted sometime Dinosaur Jr. drummer George Berz and former Minutemen and Firehose bassist Mike Watt. Mascis had worked with Watt several times before - most notably producing the final Firehose album Mr. Machinery Operator (1993), on which he also contributed some guitar and vocal parts, and contributing guitar and drum performances to several songs on Watt's first solo album Ball-Hog or Tugboat?. They embarked on four separate tours between October 2000 and the spring of 2001, including a tour of Japan and Australia, a European tour, and two full tours of the US. The set lists would be a mix of songs from both More Light and the Dinosaur Jr. back catalog, along with a handful of Stooges songs and a version of Black Flag's \\"I've Had It\\" with lead vocals sung by Watt. During their first European tour, J Mascis + The Fog participated in a John Peel session for BBC Radio 1, during which the band recorded a medley consisting of Teenage Fanclub's \\"Everything Flows\\", Pavement's \\"Range Life\\", and The Ruts' \\"In a Rut\\". This session is the only commercially available studio recording of the 2000‚Äì2001 line-up featuring Watt, and, along with a later J Mascis solo session from 2002, was released on CD by the Strange Fruit label in 2003. At some of the tour dates, the band were frequently joined onstage by former Stooges guitarist Ron Asheton, during which time Mascis and The Fog would play several Stooges classics. Sometimes the group would be joined by guest vocalists like Evan Dando and Primal Scream's Bobby Gillespie; a London appearance by The Fog with Asheton and Gillespie was marred when a fan spat upon Gillespie, which provoked the singer into hitting the fan with a microphone stand as The Fog and Asheton were playing \\"No Fun\\". The Gillespie incident notwithstanding, these appearances by Asheton later led to a one-time supergroup of Mascis, Watt, Asheton, and Ron's brother and fellow Stooge Scott Asheton, which led to the reformation of the Stooges themselves with vocalist Iggy Pop and Watt replacing the late original Stooges bassist Dave Alexander. A second European tour behind More Light was cut short when the band was involved in a van accident en route to a Swedish concert. Mascis suffered minor back injuries but rebounded from them fairly quickly and began work on the second J Mascis + The Fog album, Free So Free, released in 2002. Around the \\"Free So Free\\" tour, Mascis enlisted Kyle Spence on drums and Dave Schools (from Widespread Panic) on bass. This would be the final touring incarnation. In 2003, the house and studio owned by Mascis burned down. In 2005, Mascis put his Fog project on hold in order to tend to other business, mainly the reformation of the original Dinosaur Jr. lineup, to coincide with the re- release on the Merge label of the first three Dinosaur Jr. albums that had previously been on Homestead and SST. In December 2009, Mascis played a few shows in England with The Fog, using the Spence/Schools lineup.

It made several New York Times bestseller lists and Amazon.com included it in two \\"best\\" lists. It sold about 6,000 copies. After the book was released and dozens of women came forward accusing Cosby of sexual assault, it was \\"widely criticized for idealizing Cosby\\", according to CBS.

A forward, he won nine caps for England between 1971 and 1973, scoring one international goal. Brought up in the East End of London, he played youth football for West Ham United before he made his professional debut with Fulham in March 1963. He scored 22 goals in 63 First Division games before falling out with the management and taking a ¬£15,000 transfer to Queens Park Rangers in March 1966. He helped the club to the 1967 League Cup and to consecutive promotions through the Third Division and Second Division. In March 1972 he was sold to Manchester City for ¬£200,000. He featured in the 1974 League Cup final defeat but his time in Manchester was largely disappointing and he left the UK the following year to play for American club Tampa Bay Rowdies. He had a successful career with the Rowdies and went on to coach the club from 1984 to 1986 after previously having brief spells coaching New York United and the Carolina Lightnin'. In the 1990s he began work as a broadcaster on Sky Sports, before he was sacked in January 2005. Since that time he has appeared on numerous reality television shows, and helped to run an American-based property development company with his son. In 2015, Marsh started co-hosting a SiriusXM digital radio show about soccer, titled \\"Grumpy Pundits.\\" His co-host is Irish broadcaster, Tommy Smyth. Early life Marsh was born in Hatfield, Hertfordshire to Lilian Dredge‚Äì a housewife ‚Äì and William Marsh ‚Äì a docker. He grew up in Palatine Road, Stoke Newington, and in fact his mother only spent a few days in Hertfordshire so as to avoid going into labour during the Blitz. He had a rough upbringing as a child, particularly with his father, and in his autobiography said that this tough upbringing left him emotionally traumatised. His father came from an even more violent family himself, and was partially crippled at the age of 19 after being attacked by his father with a hammer. An only child, he described his family as \\"incredibly poor\\", and until the age of 11 he slept in the corner of his parent's bedroom ‚Äì the family shared a three-storey house with two other families and the only other room they had was a living room. He attended Arsenal matches at Highbury with his father, and also went along to see reserve team matches. The family's poverty came to an end just as Marsh was beginning his professional football career ‚Äì his father helped the landlord to fill out his weekly pool coupon, and the landlord had a massive win shortly before his death and left the house to Marsh's father in his will. He played alongside Ron \\"Chopper\\" Harris for Hackney Schools, and scored all three goals as Hackney won the schools national championship. His father secured him a trial for the West Ham United under-16s, and he impressed enough to land himself a place in the academy. However he was released after ten months by Wally St Pier, who let Marsh go so as to open up a place on the youth team for Geoff Hurst. Soon before his sixteenth birthday, Marsh was spotted by scout Bill Brown, who offered him a place in Fulham's youth programme. Playing career =Fulham= Marsh began his career with First Division side Fulham, and made his debut against Aston Villa at Craven Cottage on 23 March 1963 after Johnny Haynes picked up an injury. He scored the winning goal on his debut with a volley from a George Cohen cross, prompting manager Bedford Jezzard to state that \\"No boy could have had a better first game\\". Haynes returned to the starting line-up the next week, but Marsh was accommodated with the number eight shirt. In September 1963, he collided with John Sjoberg whilst scoring a winning goal against Leicester City and was ruled out of action for ten months with a broken jaw and skull. The incident left him with a permanent loss of hearing in his left ear. For weeks he was unable to keep his balance whilst standing, and he was told by one specialist that he would never play football again. He returned to fitness in the 1964‚Äì65 season and was utilized at centre forward, and formed an effective partnership with Haynes to secure 17 goals to become the club's top-scorer. However manager Bedford Jezzard left the club and Marsh did not get along with new boss Vic Buckingham. He ridiculed Buckingham, who in turn froze Marsh out of the first team. =Queens Park Rangers= Marsh moved across West London to join Queens Park Rangers, then in the Third Division, after manager Alec Stock paid out a ¬£15,000 fee in March 1966. QPR finished third at the end of the 1965‚Äì66 campaign, eight points outside promoted Millwall. His first full season with Rangers was his most successful, as he formed an effective strike partnership with Les Allen, whilst Roger Morgan and Mark Lazarus delivered reliable service from the wings. Marsh scored his first hat-trick for the club in a 4‚Äì0 win over Middlesbrough. He scored 44 goals in 53 games as the club became Third Division champions; his 30 league goals made him the division's top-scorer. QPR also won the League Cup, with Marsh setting Rangers on their way with four goals during a 5‚Äì0 victory over Colchester United at Layer Road. They needed a replay to overcome Aldershot, before they beat Swansea Town, top-flight Leicester City, Carlisle United and Birmingham City. Their opponents in the Wembley final were West Bromwich Albion, who had won the cup the previous year. The \\"Baggies\\" took a two-goal lead before half-time, but Rangers fought back in the second half and on the 75th minute Marsh scored what he described as \\"the defining goal of my career\\" when he made a mazy run past numerous defenders before finding the net with a 25-yard shot that went in off the post. Lazarus scored QPR's third goal six minutes later to win the game 3‚Äì2. A week after the final Tottenham Hotspur manager witnessed Marsh put in a strong performance against Bournemouth and he offered to pay QPR ¬£180,000 for Marsh and Morgan, but his offer was rejected by chairman Jim Gregory. The 1967‚Äì68 season saw a second successive promotion as QPR reached the First Division as runners-up in the Second Division, ahead of Blackpool on goal average. Marsh was again top- scorer with 14 goals despite missing the start of the season with a broken foot. He signed a new four-year contract in the summer. Rangers were unable to compete in the top-flight, and Marsh himself struggled with injury as the club suffered relegation with only 18 points to their name. He broke his foot in pre-season training for the 1968‚Äì69 campaign and missed the opening months; during this time the club struggled as Stock resigned before the season started, and he was replaced by Bill Dodgin in a caretaker capacity. By the time Marsh recovered from his injury manager Tommy Docherty's first 28-day spell in charge at Loftus Road had come and gone. In summer 1969 Marsh was sent off in a friendly against Rangers after punching Kai Johansen in retaliation for a kick Johansen gave Marsh. In the 1969‚Äì70 season he and Barry Bridges shared 46 goals equally between them, as QPR finished in ninth position. They also reached the quarter-finals of the FA Cup, which was then the club's joint-best achievement in the competition. Marsh again hit 23 goals in the 1970‚Äì71 campaign, as Rangers again finished in mid-table obscurity under the stewardship of Gordon Jago. However Marsh lost his captaincy to new signing Terry Venables. He hit 20 goals in the 1971‚Äì72 season to finish as the club's top-scorer for the second successive season. Before the season began he signed a new contract on the understanding that he would leave the club if they could not achieve promotion by the end of the season. QPR were still in the hunt for promotion by the time that Marsh was sold ‚Äì they eventually finished a few points short, however the sum offered by Manchester City was too much for the club to refuse. =Manchester City= In March 1972, he was signed for Manchester City by Malcolm Allison for a then-club record ¬£200,000. City were four points clear at the top of the table when Marsh was signed, but by the end of the season they had slipped to fourth. Many pundits criticised the signing, pointing out that Marsh was a maverick player ill-suited to Allison's well-drilled set-up. He initially replaced Wyn Davies up front in a 4-4-2 formation, before playing alongside Davies, Mike Summerbee and Francis Lee in a 4-2-4 set-up. Marsh became City's top-scorer, scoring 19 goals in 1972‚Äì73. However the club entered into a decline when Allison resigned in March 1973; over the next year Johnny Hart, Tony Book and Ron Saunders all had spells as City manager. The \\"Sky Blues\\" finished 11th in 1972‚Äì73 and 14th in 1973‚Äì74. They did though reach the final of the League Cup in 1974, losing 2‚Äì1 to Wolverhampton Wanderers at Wembley. Marsh was so disappointed by the defeat he threw away his runners-up medal. Tony Book started his second spell as City's manager in April 1974, and despite being club captain Marsh showed no respect for Book. City finished eighth in 1974‚Äì75 and 1975‚Äì76. Marsh was transfer-listed and sent to train with the reserves after chairman Peter Swales told Book the details of a private conversation the pair had held: > If you think I'm effing useless it's not going to work. Do you want to take > it back?. (Book) > No chance. In fact, thinking about it more, you're not that good. (Marsh) =Later career= In the middle of 1975 Marsh played a handful of matches for Cork Hibernians for a fee of ¬£600 a game. He later was flown to Los Angeles as a guest of Elton John, who was then chairman of the Los Angeles Aztecs in the NASL, but before he agreed to join the club he was approached by the Tampa Bay Rowdies. He was sold to the Rowdies in January 1976 for a ¬£40,000 fee. He made two oft-quoted remarks during his transfer, stating that \\"football in England had become a grey game, played on grey days by grey people\\" and upon arriving in America he announced that \\"Pel√© is known as the black Rodney Marsh\\" after the Rowdies owner said that \\"Rodney Marsh is known as the white Pel√©\\". He played from 1976 to 1979 in the States, leading the Rowdies to the Soccer Bowl in his final two seasons. Both times they would come up short. Marsh was a NASL All-Star every year, making the first-team in 1976 and 1978, the second team in 1977 and as an Honorable Mention in his final season. Despite this success he suffered from depression and was drinking heavily for much of his time there. Head coach Eddie Firmani resigned from the club in 1977 after becoming frustrated with Marsh's ill-discipline; he was replaced by John Boyle. Marsh stopped his drinking after his doctor told him that alcohol was destroying his liver and seriously shortening his life expectancy. Marsh left the club after being forced out in 1979. He went off in another tantrum after being substituted with ten minutes to go of his competitive career by head coach Gordon Jago. While serving as Rowdies manager for the 1986‚Äì87 AISA season, the long-retired Marsh was pressed into service once again as a player, due to a rash of injuries on the squad. He spent the winter of the 1976‚Äì77 season on loan at Fulham, now in the Second Division, after learning that George Best would also be playing at Craven Cottage. The \\"Cottagers\\" were then a fashionable club where celebrities would often be in attendance and players like Marsh and Best would spend much of their free time in London nightclubs; manager Alec Stock ensured that the partying off the pitch did not hamper progress on the pitch. Stock resigned and new boss Bobby Campbell took the club as high as fourth place before a run of nine defeats in 12 games saw Fulham slide down the table. The bleak wintery conditions eventually took their toll on Best and Marsh, who both returned to the US early in 1976. International career Marsh made his England debut in a 1‚Äì1 draw with Switzerland at Wembley in November 1971, coming on as a substitute for Francis Lee. He won a total of nine caps, scoring one goal, which came in a 3‚Äì0 victory over Wales. It has been reported that the England manager Alf Ramsey told him \\"I'll be watching you for the first 45 minutes and if you don't work harder I'll pull you off at half time,\\" to which Marsh replied: \\"Crikey, Alf, at QPR all we get is an orange and a cup of tea.\\" Style of play Often cited as a player who did not make the most of his talents, Marsh was a strong striker with great technical ability. An excellent dribbler of the ball, he was capable of producing moments of rare skill and extravagant attempts on goal, which earned him a reputation as a show-boater. His ability and the rarity which he played to his full potential earned him comparisons to George Best. He would regularly retaliate against players who used foul play to stop his runs, and picked up numerous fines from the FA for fighting back against his aggressors. Coaching career He retired after 1979, and coached the New York United in the ASL. He resigned three months into his contract when the general manager insisted that he sign five Uruguayan refugees to the club against his wishes. In 1981, he was appointed head coach and CEO of the newly created Carolina Lightnin', and quickly assembled a team around star midfielder Don Tobin. He coached the team to the Freedom Conference title in 1981, and they went on to beat his former club New York United 2‚Äì1 in the championship final. In 1982 they lost at the semi-final stage to the Oklahoma City Slickers. He then hired Bobby Moore as a coach. At the end of a disappointing 1983 campaign the league folded and Marsh returned to the Tampa Bay Rowdies as head coach in October 1983. There he gave Roy Wegerle his debut as a professional player. After the 1984 season the North American Soccer League also disbanded. The club remained however, and later joined the National Professional Soccer League. Marsh relinquished his coaching duties and remained on as CEO, and appointed Mark Lawrenson and later Malcolm Allison, Ricky Hill, David Hay and Ken Fogarty as head coaches. Media career After ending his coaching career, Marsh undertook a three-year roadshow tour with George Best. He began his career in the media with Best, presenting football related videos, before he became a regular feature on television. In 1994, he spent a brief period as CEO of Queens Park Rangers. Marsh worked as a pundit for Sky Sports for many years. Whilst there he was involved in long-running banter with Bradford City and its supporters in the 1999‚Äì2000 season, in which he flippantly dismissed their chances of survival in the Premier League. He offered to shave all of his hair off if the club stayed up, and honoured his bet and had his hair removed in the centre circle of Valley Parade. He appeared on Soccer Saturday for a total of 11 years until he was sacked in January 2005. He was fired after he joked about the 2004 Asian tsunami during a live broadcast of You're On Sky Sports. He had said: \\"David Beckham has turned down a move to Newcastle United because of trouble with the 'Toon Army in Asia'.\\" Marsh subsequently apologised on air however this was not enough to save his job. Since then Marsh attempted to rebuild his career with appearances on reality television. He appeared in the 2007 series of ITV's I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! where he was the fifth person to be voted off the show; Celebrity Come Dine with Me on Channel 4 in January 2009, in which he came in joint second place tied with Abi Titmuss; the first series of Celebrity Coach Trip on Channel 4 in November 2010, where he was partnered with Cheryl Baker; other notable appearances include Sing If You Can and Cash in the Attic. He is currently cohost of Grumpy Pundits on Sirius Radio. Personal life He married Jean Barry in March 1967. The pair met a few years earlier at a jazz club in Manor Park.

Vuckovich was drafted by the Chicago White Sox in 1974. He batted and threw right-handed. Vuckovich graduated from Conemaugh Valley High School and went on to Clarion University to play baseball. Nearly 30 years to the day after the White Sox drafted Vuckovich they drafted his son, Peter Vuckovich, Jr., who also attended both Conemaugh Valley High School and Clarion University, in the 48th round of the 2004 amateur draft. Vuckovich, winner of the 1982 AL Cy Young Award, is a member of the Clarion University Sports Hall of Fame. Vuckovich is also a member of both the Western PA Sports Hall of Fame and the Pennsylvania Sports Hall of Fame. Vuckovich is of Serbian background. Baseball career Vuckovich developed a reputation for bizarre, hyper-competitive behavior during his 12 season career. He would fidget, twitch, pace, and convulse while on the mound. He was known to cross his eyes and stick his tongue out at batters. He would spit in his glove, scream at umpires while in the stretch, and sometimes step to the back of the mound and dry heave. His colorful personality made him a fan favorite. =Toronto Blue Jays and St. Louis Cardinals= After minimal duty with Chicago from 1975‚Äì76, Vuckovich was selected by the Toronto Blue Jays in the 1976 MLB expansion draft. Even though the young Blue Jays lost 107 games in 1977, and although mostly used in relief, Vuckovich managed a 7-7 record with eight saves. He recorded the first shutout in Toronto franchise history, a 2-0 victory over Jim Palmer and the Orioles. He also recorded the first save in Toronto franchise history on April 7, 1977 versus the Chicago White Sox. Involved in a multi-player trade to the St. Louis Cardinals, Vuckovich's career went to the next level. By 1978, he started more often, winning 39 games for the Cardinals during three years. He finished third in the National League in ERA with a 2.55 mark in 1978, and ranked fourth in shutouts (3) in 1980. =Milwaukee Brewers= A part of a blockbuster seven-player trade in December 1980, Vuckovich went to the Milwaukee Brewers along with Rollie Fingers and Ted Simmons. With the Brewers, Vuckovich continued his stellar pitching. He led the American League in wins (14) and winning percentage Win- Loss % (.778) during the strike-shortened season. When Milwaukee won the AL pennant in , Vuckovich won the Cy Young Award with an 18-6 record and a 3.34 ERA, and once again tied for the league lead with the Baltimore Orioles' Jim Palmer in winning percentage Win-Loss % (.750) He lost Game Two of the ALCS to the Angels 4-2, and started the decisive fifth game, though not figuring in the decision. In the 1982 World Series, the Cardinals beat him 6-2 in Game Three, and he got a no-decision in the final loss. This was, however, proved to be the zenith of his career, as Vuckovich had been battling shoulder pain for two seasons, and in spring training of , it was discovered that he had torn his rotator cuff. Vuckovich skipped surgery in favor of an exercise rehabilitation. He attempted an unsuccessful comeback for three games and went 0-2 in 14 innings, then missed all of 1984. Subsequent and prolonged comeback attempts all failed, and by the end of the season, Milwaukee released Vuckovich. In an eleven season career, Vuckovich posted a 93-69 record with 882 strikeouts and a 3.66 ERA in 1455.1 innings pitched. In postseason play, he was 1-2 with a 3.74 ERA. While with the Brewers, Vuckovich co-owned a bar in Milwaukee with outfielder Gorman Thomas. It was called \\"Stormin' & Vuke's\\", a play on their nicknames. =Following retirement= Following his retirement, Vuckovich worked for three years (1989‚Äì1991) as a television announcer for the Milwaukee Brewers. Vuckovich portrayed fictional Yankees slugger Clu Haywood in the film Major League.Major League (1989) In 1992, he was hired by the Pittsburgh Pirates as a pitching instructor. Vuckovich served as the pitching coach for the Pittsburgh Pirates for the 1997-2000 seasons. He then worked his way through the Pirates organization to the position of special assistant to the general manager with the Pirates, and held a similar post with the Seattle Mariners' organization under Jack Zduriencik, Seattle's GM from 2009‚Äì15. In 2016, Vuckovich is serving as a professional scout for the Arizona Diamondbacks.

The book was initially issued in one paperback-only edition by the specialty crime and mystery publishing house. King's next novel for Hard Case Crime was Joyland, which was published in June 2013. Hard Case Crime reissued The Colorado Kid in an illustrated paperback edition in May 2019. The third-person narrative concerns the investigation of the body of an unidentified man found on a tiny island off the coast of Maine. Lacking any identification or obvious clues, the case reaches nothing but repeated dead ends. Over a year later the man is identified, but all further important questions remain unanswered. The two-person staff of the island newspaper maintain a longstanding fascination with the case, and twenty-five years later use the mysterious tale to ply the friendship and test the investigative mettle of a post-graduate intern rookie reporter. A television series loosely inspired by The Colorado Kid, titled Haven, aired on Syfy from July 2010 to December 2015. Plot summary Opening in medias res as the news staff of The Weekly Islander pays for lunch at a restaurant, editor Dave Bowie and founder Vince Teague test young intern Stephanie McCann's powers of deduction regarding their unorthodox tipping procedure. She impresses them by discerning that the restaurant management pools all the tips and splits them equally among the staff, while Dave and Vince want to leave an especially large tip earmarked for their waitress who has fallen on hard times. They discuss some local unsolved crimes and oddities, which have gained circulation in mainland newspapers as far away as Boston during the traditional Halloween season interest in such tales. The friendly assessment becomes more intense as the elderly island natives and Stephanie return to the office, and she asks if the veteran reporters have \\"ever come across a real unexplained mystery\\". Dave and Vince take turns recounting a strange incident and investigation. On April 24, 1980, two teenagers stumbled across a man's body, early in the morning. Slumped against a trash can, and carrying no identification, the body bore no clear indicators of foul play. Cause of death was determined to be asphyxiation, as a large chunk of flesh was extracted from the victim's throat. Every potential clue leads to small revelations, but bigger mysteries. Though the investigation is lightly bungled, everything seems inexplicable, from how the fish-dinner stomach contents could line up with his ferry boat crossing, to the single Russian coin in his pocket, and the pack of cigarettes missing one cigarette when the autopsy indicated he was not a smoker. More than a year later, thanks to a sharp-eyed rookie spotting an out-of-state cigarette tax stamp among the man's personal effects, the John Doe becomes known as The Colorado Kid. Eventually the man's identity is traced: James Cogan of Nederland, Colorado. He was a commercial artist living a normal middle-class life with his wife, last seen at a seemingly average workday before inexplicably disappearing. There was no hint of money troubles, adultery, drug addiction or mental illness -- the factors normally associated with someone leaving home so suddenly. Everyone involved with the case is at a loss as to how or why the man could have traveled over 2000 miles (3000 km) in the five hours between when he was last sighted in Colorado and first sighted in Maine, when there was at the time no direct airline flight to account for his arrival. In the Weekly Islander offices, the three friends, old and new, ferret out all the answers they can from the facts of the 25-year-old investigation, then speculate on what might have happened, and meditate on the nature of true mysteries. Despite the lack of clear evidence, Dave and Vince hypothesize the Colorado Kid was murdered. He probably flew to Maine on a chartered jet under an uncertain but pressing emergency and carried the Colorado cigarettes as a clue to his origins should he come to harm. Though Dave and Vince shared other unsolved crimes and oddities with outsiders, they have kept the Colorado Kid a secret due to their belief that a big-town newspaper or glossy travel magazine would tell the story inaccurately by wanting to provide resolution to the account that stubbornly defied a clean culmination. They inform Stephanie that while they were \\"the last people alive who know the whole thing\\", having heard the tale of The Colorado Kid, \\"Now there's you, Steffi.\\" The warm proclamation seems to signal the young woman's final approval by the old guard of the Islander. Characters ;Dave Bowie :The 65-year-old managing editor of The Weekly Islander, the small-circulation newspaper servicing the island of Moose-Lookit, surrounding isles and some mainland communities. ;Stephanie McCann :A 22-year-old Ohio University graduate on summer internship at the Islander. Her duties on the paper involve writing \\"mostly ads\\" and the \\"Arts 'N Things\\" column.

With little but a wad of meat lodged in his throat, and a nearly full pack of cigarettes in his pocket, there seem to be no indicators to his identity, or how he arrived on Moose-Lookit. King's comments about a clue King noted on his personal website on October 7, 2005 that an apparent research error regarding the rise of Seattle, Washington-based Starbucks Coffee may hold other implications, tying the book's story to the same shared universe of many of his other novels: \\"The review of The Colorado Kid in today‚Äôs issue of today's USA Today mentions that there was no Starbucks in Denver in 1980. Don‚Äôt assume that‚Äôs a mistake on my part. The constant readers of the Dark Tower series may realize that is not necessarily a continuity error, but a clue.\\" Editions The Colorado Kid was originally published in 2005 as a paperback original by Hard Case Crime. In 2007, PS Publishing published the novel as a hardcover limited edition in four different states illustrated by three different artists (Edward Miller, J.K. Potter, and Glenn Chadbourne). An audiobook of The Colorado Kid was produced by Simon & Schuster Audio, narrated by Jeffrey DeMunn. Television adaptation In 2009, Universal Networks International announced the TV series Haven, loosely based on the setting of the novel. The series, which had an initial 13-episode commitment, was developed by E1 Entertainment and Piller/Segan/Shepherd, producers of the Dead Zone TV series. Scott Shepherd served as showrunner, with Lloyd Segan and Shawn Piller executive producing, together with the writers of the series pilot, Sam Ernst and Jim Dunn.Jericho hottie to star in Syfy's Haven The series debuted on Syfy on July 9, 2010. The show ran for five seasons until December 17, 2015.

Born in Santo Amaro, Bahia, she started her career in Rio de Janeiro in 1964 with the show \\"Opini√£o\\" (\\"Opinion\\"). Due to its popularity, with performances all over the country, and the popularity of her 1965 single \\"Carcar√°\\", the artist became a star in Brazil. Beth√¢nia is the sister of the singer-songwriter Caetano Veloso and of the writer-songwriter Mabel Velloso, as well as being aunt of the singers Bel√¥ Velloso and Jota Velloso. The singer has released 50 studio albums in 47 years of career, and is among the 10 best-selling music artists in Brazil, having sold more than 26 million records. Beth√¢nia was ranks in 2012, by Rolling Stone Brasil magazine, as the fifth biggest voice of Brazilian music.  Early life and initial artistic activities  Beth√¢nia is the sixth out of eight children born into the family of Jos√© Telles Veloso (Seu Zeca), a government official, and Claudionor Viana Telles Veloso (Dona Can√¥), a housewife. The name Maria Beth√¢nia was chosen by her brother Caetano Veloso after the homonymous hit song written by composer Capiba and famous at the time in the voice of N√©lson Gon√ßalves. National Archives of Brazil. In her childhood, she had aspirations to become an actress. However, her mother was a musician, so music was prevalent in the Veloso household. Though Beth√¢nia was born in Santo Amaro da Purifi√ß√£o, her family moved to Salvador, Bahia when she was 13. The move allowed her to experience the bohemian, intellectual circles of the city as well as to visit theaters. When she was 16, her brother Caetano Veloso invited her to sing in a film for which he was producing the soundtrack, but she refused. Nevertheless, the film's director, √Ålvaro Guimar√£es, liked her voice and invited the young musician to perform in the 1963 N√©lson Rodrigues's musical Boca de Ouro. This time Beth√¢nia accepted, and for the first time in her life she went on stage to sing for an audience, opening the play performing a samba by Ataulfo Alves. That same year, Beth√£nia and her sister met singers Gilberto Gil and Gal Costa; Caetano had been invited to put on an MPB show to inaugurate the Teatro Vila Velha. The four artists got together and, in 1964, staged N√≥s, por exemplo (We, for example). The show was a success and was presented again twenty months later, with the participation of singer-songwriter Tom Z√©. That same year, the group mounted another show called Nova Bossa Velha e Velha Bossa Nova (New Old Bossa and Old New Bossa). Still in that year, directed by Caetano and Gil, Beth√¢nia performed another musical, this time on her own, called Mora na Filosofia (Lives in Philosophy). She began performing again with her brother, as well as Gilberto Gil, Gal Costa, and Tom Z√©, at the opening of the Vila Velha Theater in the next year. During one of these performances, the bossa nova musician Nara Le√£o offered her an opportunity to take her place in a series of performances titled \\"Opini√£o\\".  Career  Maria Beth√¢nia parades for Mangueira at the carnival of 2016. She released her first single, a protest song called \\"Carcar√°\\", in 1965, the same year that her brother released his first recording. After releasing \\"Carcar√°\\" Beth√¢nia returned from Rio de Janeiro, where she had gone to attend college, to Bahia. This was to only be a brief visit, as around that time she was performing at nightclubs and other venues throughout Brazil. This song also got her an offer from an RCA Records representative to record for the company. However Beth√¢nia continually changed record labels throughout the 1970s. In 1973 Beth√¢nia released Drama, Luz Da Noite, in which she performed traditional Brazilian songs, as well as incorporating literary elements. In 1977 Beth√¢nia went on tour and released a gold-certified album, both with the name of P√°ssaro da Manh√£. She released √Ålibi a year later which was also gold- certified with over a million copies sold. Around the end of the 1970s, Beth√¢nia became more artistically conservative, moving away from the Tropicalismo music her frequent collaborators, including Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil, had been playing. During the 1980s and '90s Beth√¢nia continued to record and perform, with 1993's As Can√ß√µes Que Voc√™ Fez Para Mim becoming the year's most successful album in Brazil. In 1976, she released a live album with Doces B√°rbaros, a M√∫sica popular brasileira supergroup. It was recorded June 24 of that year at Anhembi Stadium in S√£o Paulo.[ Allmusic history] Its members were Gilberto Gil, Caetano Veloso, Maria Beth√¢nia and Gal Costa, four of the biggest names in the history of the Music of Brazil. The band was the subject of a 1977 documentary directed by Jom Tob Azulay. In 1994, they performed a tribute concert to Mangueira school of samba.[ Allmusic] French filmmaker Georges Gachot completed a documentary film \\"Musica √© perfume\\" about her which was worldwide distributed. In 2008 she recorded an album with the Cuban singer Omara Portuondo which was followed by a Live DVD In 2015, her album Meus Quintais was nominated for the 16th Latin Grammy Awards in the Best MPB Album category. Controversy In March 2011, Beth√¢nia found herself in the midst of a controversy after receiving permission from the Ministry of Culture of Brazil to make a poetry blog budgeted for $1.3 million tax free Reais ($783,000 USD). The financing of the project would fall under the so- called Lei Rouanet (English: Rouanet Law), which is designed as an incentive to promote Brazilian culture. The law allows companies and individuals to invest part of their income tax in cultural projects. The singer, considered one of the greats in Brazilian music and who has a track record of working with poets and reading bits of her favorite poetry, would use the platform to interpret poetry, both of her own and from other authors, in song through a daily series of videos, 365 in total, for the blog O Mundo Precisa de Poesia (English: The World Needs Poetry). Much of the criticisms surrounds on the project's cost and the fact that a rich and well-known artist like Beth√¢nia can rely on such a process to get sponsored, while hundreds of other minor artists cannot find ways to survive. Pablo Villa√ßa, from the blog Cinema em Cena (Movie Theater at Home) estimated that, taking out the amount that would go to the collectors, around R$1.17 million would go toward the blog's production. Each video, then, would cost about R$3,200. He stated that this cost would not be compatible with videos of 3‚Äì5 minutes length consisting of just one person reciting poetry. Blogger, journalist and filmmaker Mauricio Caleiro explained that this process, appropriated by the interests of big names and governed by the market, has suffered from great distortions over the years, favoring respected names over beginners, according to him: > \\"(‚Ä¶) the imbroglio involving the baiana singer revealed the problems of the > ‚ÄúRouanet Law‚Äù, a tool that, shortly after being created, played a key role > in the survival of certain artistic areas during the neoliberal autumn, but > as the episode in question shows, it eventually lead to serious distortions > in relations between economy, ideology and cultural production.\\" To mock the whole situation, a satirical blog entitled Bethania: 1 million reasons for you to access was created by blogger Raphael Quatroci. On March 16, the Ministry of Culture released a statement affirming the legality of the process and reiterating that the approval had strictly followed the rules. It said that \\"the criteria in the CNIC (National Commission on Cultural Incentives) are technical and legal, so to reject an applicant because she/he is famous, or not, would set up obvious and untenable discrimination.\\" Then, on March 27, Caetano Veloso, Beth√¢nia's brother, came out to defend his sister, noting that other projects by many other artists, both known and unknown, were authorized to raise larger amounts.  Personal life  She moved to Rio de Janeiro alone, at age 17, in 1963, where she lives today. Very discreet, she is not often seen in social events. Currently she lives alone in a residence that she bought in a neighborhood far away, close to the nature and bush, far from the bustle of Rio. The singer does not have children, and is adept to Brazilian religions of African origin, such as the Candombl√©s.

Scorer of an absolute belter for Norwich against Newcastle, thundering the ball into the top right bracket giving Shay Given absolutely no chance. Club career Safri started his youth career at Rachad Bernoussi. The following year, he was promoted to the senior squad. He was a midfielder best known for his passing and tackling ability. In 2001, he joined Coventry City where he played until 2004, scoring once against Sheffield Wednesday. In December 2003, he had come under fire after breaking the leg of Sunderland player Colin Healy. The next season, he joined Norwich City for an initial fee of ¬£500,000 in the summer of 2004, after the Canaries had been promoted to the Premier League. Safri became popular among the Norwich fans towards the end of the 2004‚Äì05 campaign and during the 2005‚Äì06 season following a series of impressive performances. He scored a 40-yard strike against Newcastle United in April 2005 during the team's fight against relegation from the Premiership. Safri was linked with a move to Feyenoord in the summer of 2005, but stayed at Carrow Road. As a tribute to the player, Norwich City supporters devised a song which was sung regularly at home games, to the tune of Status Quo's 'Rocking all over the world' - \\"Here we are, here we are and here we go, Youssef's better than Juninho, Moroccan all over the world!\\" Following the 3‚Äì1 defeat at Plymouth Argyle in September 2006, Safri and teammate Dickson Etuhu were reported to have traded punches on the team bus during their return journey to East Anglia, although these reports are now thought to have been discredited. After Peter Grant was appointed Norwich manager in October 2006, Safri was not a regular selection. There was speculation that he would leave the club in January 2007, fuelled by his comments in the Eastern Daily Press on 29 December 2006 in which Safri indicated that he would seek a transfer if Grant continued to use him as a substitute. Safri remained at Carrow Road until the end of the 2006‚Äì07 season, but after falling out with manager Peter Grant, Grant stated in the press on 1 August that Safri would not play for the club again. On 2 August 2007 he signed for Norwich's championship rivals Southampton on a two-year contract for a fee rumoured to be of the order of ¬£250,000. On 24 October 2007 he was sent off in the 90th minute of Southampton's away defeat to Bristol City, for a heavy tackle on Lee Johnson, whose subsequent reaction to Safri pushing him by all accounts was exaggerated, resulting in a straight Red. On 7 July 2008 he joined Qatar Sports Club, for a fee in the region of ¬£13,000,000, stating his desire to move to the Persian Gulf region as the reason behind the move. International career Safri was a key player with the Moroccan national team during the 2004 African Nations Cup, and was a member of the national squad competing at 1997 FIFA World Youth Championship, the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. Coaching career At the end of 2013 season he retired and started a role of assisting coach in his first club Raja Casablanca. In the following 2015/16 season, he was assistant manager of Jamal Sellami at Difa√¢ Hassani El Jadidi. In May 2018, Safri returned to Raja Casablanca, again as assistant manager, this time under manager Juan Carlos Garrido.Raja: Youssef Safri nomm√© entra√Æneur adjoint de Garrido, sport24info.ma, 4 May 2018 Garrido was sacked on 28 January 2019, and Safri was appointed caretaker manager.Raja Casablanca sacks head coach Carlos Garrido, yabiladi.com, 29 January 2019 It lasted for two days, before Patrice Carteron was appointed.

Harmon and Schrab created Channel 101, the Los Angeles-based film festival that inspired Channel 101: NY. Channel 101: NY launched on February 3, 2005 as Channel 102 at the Variety Underground showcase at the Parkside Lounge. For that debut screening, all pilots that were submitted which met the five-minute maximum length were accepted . Eleven were shown, and the top five became the first \\"prime time\\" shows of Channel 102. Concept and history The concept is identical to that of Channel 101, and follows its model of operations. Anyone can submit a pilot using a private link or DV tape. The content, genre, and style of the show are entirely open as long as the length of the show is under five minutes. From all the submissions, only a portion is screened for the live audience. Between three and seven new pilots join the previous months' prime time of five continuing shows. At the end of the screening, all audience members fill out \\"Executive Decision Ballots,\\" checking off their five top shows. Only the shows with the highest five ratings will return next month with a new episode, all other shows are \\"cancelled.\\" The \\"Prime Time Panel\\" is made up of representatives from the shows with the highest audience vote totals from the previous month's screening.

It was founded by Bulat Abilov, Altynbek Sarsenbaev, Oraz Jandosov, and Tulegen Zhukeyev, and held its first constituent congress on 29 April 2005. Sarsenbaev was murdered on 12 February 2006, sparking much protest from party opposition. Origin Its constituent congress was held on 29 April 2005. The party was formed as a split from the Ak Zhol party. Differences between the platforms of Ak Zhol and Na«µyz Ak Zhol parties are vague, if they exist at all. The split seems to be a result of personal struggles within the Ak Zhol leadership, which have effectively plagued Kazakh opposition since independence. On 13 February 2005, Ak Zhol Party co-chairman Alikhan Baimenov, cast a vote of no confidence in Altynbek Sarsenbayev, another co-chairman, alleging that Sarsenbayev had been violating the party constitution prohibiting collaboration with other political parties.Ibragim Alibekov, Kazakhstan‚Äôs Leading Opposition Party Faces Split, Eurasia Insight, February 16, 2005, http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav021605.shtml. Sarsenbayev had been active in the formation of the ‚ÄúCoordinating Council of Democratic Forces,‚Äù an alliance including the Communist Party and the Democratic Choice of Kazakhstan movement. Apparently this dispute caused the split in Ak Zhol Party. Development The party's co-leaders were Bulat Abilov, Altynbek Sarsenbaev, Oraz Jandosov, and Tulegen Zhukeyev until Sarsenbayev was murdered. The appeal of Na«µyz Ak Zhol, like all other opposition parties, among the electorate is insignificant. Na«µyz Ak Zhol was denied official registration for more than a year, effectively disqualifying it from nominating a candidate for the presidential elections in December 2005. Na«µyz Ak Zhol, unable to nominate Altinbek Sarsenbaev as a candidate, supported the presidential candidate of the opposition coalition For a Just Kazakhstan in the December 2005 elections.Cengiz Surucu, 4 Aralƒ±k 2005 Kazakistan Ba≈ükanlƒ±k Se√ßimleri √úzerine G√∂zlemler, OAKA, vol: 1, No: 1, 2006, pp. 153-158.

It is located on the River Robe, which empties into Lough Mask two kilometres to the west. The population in the 2016 Census was 3,770. History =Early history= Dating back to 1390, Ballinrobe is said to be the oldest town in Mayo. The registry of the Dominican friary of Athenry mentions the monastery de Roba, an Augustinian friary whose restored ruins are one of the landmarks of the town today. The District Courtroom is housed in the old Market House, a marketing centre for local produce established in 1752. Its development into an important economic centre was due to a Royal Patent granted to the people of Ballinrobe on 6 December 1606 by King James. This allowed the town to hold fairs and markets. Obtaining a market charter was an important step in the economic development of a town and required having a spokesperson who was in the king's favour. The town became the largest and most important in the area. Market day in Ballinrobe was Monday. Each commodity had its special place in the town. Well into the mid-1900s, turf, hay, potatoes, turnips, and cabbage were sold on Abbey Street; poultry on Glebe Street; calves on Bridge Street; and cloth, flannel, woollen socks, lace, wheat, oats, and barley outside the Market House. There were special livestock fairs held at different times of the year for pigs, cattle, and sheep. Perishable goods such as butter, meat, and bread were sold in the lower part of the Market Hall. The upper floor was used as a meeting hall. In 1698, it was the site of a Commission of Inquiry which among other things, relocated property from Catholic to Protestant landlords. In 1716, the County Assizes (Civil and Criminal Courts) were held in Ballinrobe, most likely in the Market Hall. Ballinrobe Chronicle was the local newspaper published from 1866‚Äì1903. On 17 May 1919, the first of the Republican law courts were set up in Ballinrobe.Macardle, Dorothy (1937) The Irish Republic (3-left book club edition, ed. V. Gollanz), p.362 The first court under the direct authority of the Dail sat at Ballinrobe, on 17 May 1920 and was reported with some pride in the national press.The Transformation of Ireland 1900-2000, Diarmuid Ferriter. Cranmore House was built in 1838 by Alexander Clendining Lambert who was an agent of the Knox family. He leased the land on which the house was built from Colonel Charles Nesbit Knox of Castle Lack, County Mayo. It is now a ruin, having had its roof removed in 1960, and is situated at the corner of Bowgate Street and Main Street.The Abandoned Mansions of Ireland 11 : More Portraits of Forgotten Stately Homes:2 By Tarquin Blake Moore Hall was the house and estate of George Henry Moore and family, is situated six miles north of Ballinrobe. The Moores were an aristocratic Irish family who built Moore Hall between 1792 and 1795. The ruin of the house is not open to the public due to its poor condition, but, there are forest walks and fishing on Lough Carra. Bunadober Mill is located off the Ballinrobe/Clonbur road (L1613 and R345) close to Cairn Daithi and is the site of a rare horizontal mill, also known locally as Moran's Mill. The surrounding area was once titled Bun an dTobar (Bottom of the Spring Wells). The water flowing here arrives by an underground river. When tested with dye, it was established its mother source was the Bulkaun River that runs through part of Ballinrobe town. This location for a mill probably dates back many centuries, however, since 1885 it was operated, amongst others by a William Walsh. Around the 1900s John and Bridget Moran took over. Bridget continued to work the mill when John died in 1916 and when their son John took possession he built a corn drying kiln. In 1980 the mill finally closed and was taken under State protection. There is no public access at present but there are plans afoot to restore the mill to full working order by the Office of Public Works. This rare surviving example of the horizontal mill in Ireland contained other mill machinery of significance and once powered a wide range of operations, including blacksmithing, stone and wood cutting. The area just past the mill was used in the 1800s and 1900s as a laundry for washing blankets from the two local barracks, the infantry and cavalry as the water was considered pure and clean with few impurities. Ballinrobe bakeries were Western Pride and Country Crust merged in 1989 to form Irish Pride bread along with Galway based Lydon House and other ones too. =Catholic history= In 1704, a new law required the registration of Catholic priests. The Catholic Church was suppressed throughout Ireland. There are no records for any Catholic rites in the area before 1831, however, some priests continued to perform the rites in secret. The name of one of them is known: Fr. Duffy ministered in Ballinrobe from 1696 until 1712. He was captured and deported to Spain, where he died. There appears to have been a number of other priests between 1649 and 1875, who were associated with the Augustine Abbey. Fr. Conway was appointed the first curate of Ballinrobe in 1847. He was the minister to both Ballinrobe and Partry for a number of years and was responsible for negotiating permission, with a Colonel Knox to construct St. Mary's Catholic Church on Main Street. The church was started under Fr. Conway in 1853. Subsequent curates were Fr. Hardiman and Dean Ronayne. Fr. Hardiman is credited with bringing the Mercy Order of nuns to Ballinrobe in 1851, and Dean Ronayne is credited with bringing the Christian Brothers there in 1876. The local Sisters of Mercy Convent was founded from Westport in 1851. Their mission included the education of children, visitation and care of the sick, and helping the poor. Saint Mary's Catholic Church contains eight low light windows by Harry Clarke which were commissioned by Monsignor d'Alton in the autumn of 1924. The windows depict scenes from the life of Jesus and Mary, and eight Irish Saints.Strangest Genius:The stained glass of Harry Clarke by Costigan and Cullen. Ballinrobe has one of the largest collections of Harry Clarke Stained-glass panels in St. Mary's RC Church with the first four inserted in 1924. This was followed by a further 12 panels in 1925 when Harry Clarke visited Ballinrobe to view his work. Fortunately, there are eight of his signed drawings for these windows in existence with copies in Ballinrobe. For the 150th anniversary of St. Mary‚Äôs a book give an in-depth description of the panels was published. These windows form part of the Ballinrobe Heritage Walk which covers 30 historic sites in Ballinrobe. These are marked with bronze ground markers and a free booklet is available in the local library. =The Union Workhouse= In 1839, the Union Workhouse of the Poor Law Union of Ballinrobe was founded. Ballinrobe suffered greatly during the Great Famine of 1845 to 1849. With 2,000 inmates at the height of the famine, the workhouse was so overcrowded that on 23 March 1847, The Mayo Constitution reported: > In Ballinrobe the workhouse is in the most awfully deplorable state, > pestilence having attacked paupers, officers, and all. In fact, this > building is one horrible charnel house, the unfortunate paupers being nearly > all the victims of a fearful fever, the dying and the dead, we might say, > huddled together. The master has become the victim of this dread disease; > the clerks, a young man whose energies were devoted to the well-being of the > union, has been added to the victims; the matron, too, is dead; and the > respected, and esteemed physician has fallen before the ravages of > pestilence, in his constant attendance on the diseased inmates. This is the > position of the Ballinrobe house, every officer swept away, while the number > of deaths among the inmates is unknown; and we forgot to add that the Roman > Catholic chaplain is also dangerously ill of the same epidemic. Now the > Ballinrobe board have complied with the Commissioner's orders, in admitting > a houseful of paupers and in striking a new rate, which cannot be collected; > while the unfortunate inmates, if they escape the awful epidemic, will > survive only to be the subjects of a lingering death by starvation! Ninety-six people died in just one week in April 1849. The dead were buried in unmarked, shallow graves, located just outside the boundary on the southwest of the ruins. In 1922, during the Irish Civil War, a great deal of the structure was burned, although the main portion remains to this day. =Transatlantic flight by Lituanica II= In 1935, Feliksas Vaitkus landed his plane, Lituanica II, near Ballinrobe. He was the sixth person to make a successful flight over the Atlantic Ocean with a single engine, single seat airplane. Vaitkus fought terrible weather conditions and was helped considerably by hourly broadcasts from an Irish radio station. He learned that Dublin was fogged in, as well as all areas heading east as far as the Baltic Sea. He knew that he could not make it to Kaunas due to his low fuel supply, and being exhausted after a 23-hour struggle fighting the elements, he felt it was best to land somewhere in Ireland. Vaitkus spotted an open field at Ballinrobe and came down, with the airplane suffering extensive damage, but he himself suffered no injuries. Lituanica II was crated for shipment to Lithuania, where it was restored. He went to Kaunas, where he was given a hero‚Äôs welcome.\\"The Second Transatlantic Flight. Felix Waitkus: Forgotten Hero\\" by Edward W. Baranauskas Ballinrobe today Ballinrobe is a market town. Its recent growth is attributable to a national construction boom and its development as a dormitory town for both Galway and Castlebar.

Charles Boycott (1832‚Äì1897) was a British land agent whose ostracism by his community around Ballinrobe gave rise to the term \\"boycott\\". No√´l Browne (1915‚Äì1997), the first inter-party government's minister for health, lived on Church Lane in his youth. He attended the local Christian Brothers School. Shocked by the absence of antenatal care for pregnant woman, and the resulting infant mortality rates in Ireland, he proposed free access to health care for mothers and children in a new \\"mother and child scheme\\".Maverick voices: Conversations with political and cultural rebels by Kurt Jacobsen.

They were also known as the G√©lu√≥l√π (, customary phonetic: Gelu, Khololo, Khorlo, or Harluut). Karluks gave their name to the distinct Karluk group of the Turkic languages, which also includes the Uyghur, Uzbek and Ili Turki languages. Karluks were known as a coherent ethnic group with autonomous status within the G√∂kt√ºrk khaganate and the independent states of the Karluk yabghu, Karakhanids and Qarlughids before being absorbed in the Chagatai Khanate of the Mongol empire. They were also called Uch-Oghuz meaning \\"Three Oghuz\\".Gumilev L.N, 1967, Ancient Turks, p. 61-62. Despite the similarity of names, Mahmud al-Kashgari's Dƒ´wƒÅn LughƒÅt al-Turk wrote: \\"Karluks is a division of nomadic Turks.

However, Marcel Erdal critiques this as a folk etymology, as \\"[i]n Old Turkic the suffix +lXk, which is implied in this account, had fourfold vowel harmony, and the +lXk derivate from kar would in Old Turkic be *karlƒ±k and not karluk\\".Erdal, M.

Thus Erdal concluded that \\"the name is likely to be an exonym, formed as an -(O)k derivate from the verb kar-ƒ±l- ‚Äòto mingle (intr.)‚Äô discussed in Erdal (1991: 662); it would thus have signified ‚Äòthe mingled ones‚Äô, presumably because the tribe evolved from the mingling of discrete groups,\\" as already suggested by Doerfer.Erdal, M.

He conquered the Karluks in the west, the Kyrgyz in the north, and took the title Yizhuchebi Khagan. The Karluks allied with the Tiele and their leaders the Uyghurs against the Turkic Kaganate, and participated in enthroning the victorious head of the Uyghur (Toquz Oghuz). After that, a smaller part of the Karluks joined the Uyghurs and settled in the Bogdo-Ola mountains in Mongolia, the larger part settled in the area between Altai and the eastern Tien Shan.N.Aristov, \\"Usuns and Kyrgyzes, or Kara-Kyrgyzes\\", Bishkek, 2001, pp. 246‚Äì247 In 650, at the time of their submission to the Chinese, the Karluks had three tribes: Mouluo Ë¨ÄËêΩ / Moula Ë¨ÄÂâå (Bulaq?), Chisi ÁÜæ‰øü or Pofu Â©ÜÂåê / Posuo Â©ÜÂ®ë / Suofu Â®ëÂåêEcsedy, Ildik√≥ \\"A Contribution to the History of Karluks in the T'ang Period\\" in Acta Orientalia Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae, Vol. 34, No. 1/3 (1980), p. 29-32 (Sebeƒü?), and Tashili Ë∏èÂØ¶Âäõ (Tashlyk?)\\"Karluk Djabghu State (756-940)\\" Qazaqstan TarihyGolden, Peter B.

On paper, the Karluk divisions received Chinese names as Chinese provinces, and their leaders received Chinese state titles. Later, the Karluks spread from the valley of the river Kerlyk along the Irtysh River in the western part of the Altay to beyond the Black Irtysh, Tarbagatai, and towards the Tien Shan.N.Aristov, \\"Usuns and Kyryzes, or Kara-Kyryzes\\", Bishkek, 2001, p. 246 By the year 665 The Karluk union was led by a former Uch-Karluk bey with the title K√ºl-Erkin, now titled \\"Yabgu\\" (prince), who had a powerful army. The Karluk vanguard left the Altay region and at the beginning of the 8th century reached the banks of the Amu Darya.W. Barthold, \\"Four Studies In History Of Central Asia\\", Leiden, E. J. Brill, 1962, pp. 87‚Äì92 Famed for their woven carpets in the pre-Muslim era, they were considered a vassal state by the Tang Dynasty after the final conquest of the Transoxania regions by the Chinese in 739. The Karluk rose in rebellion against the G√∂kt√ºrk, then the dominant tribal confederation in the region, in about 745, and established a new tribal confederation with the Uygur and Basmyl tribes.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica However, Karluks and Basmyls were defeated and forcibly incorporated into the Toquz Oghuz tribal confederation, led by the Uyghur Yaglakar clan.Old Book of Tang vol. 195 \\"ÊúâÂçÅ‰∏ÄÈÉΩÁù£Ôºå[...] ÊØè‰∏ÄÈÉ®ËêΩ‰∏ÄÈÉΩÁù£„ÄÇÁ†¥ÊãîÊÇâÂØÜÔºåÊî∂‰∏ÄÈÉ®ËêΩÔºåÁ†¥ËëõÈÇèÁ•øÔºåÊî∂‰∏ÄÈÉ®ËêΩÔºåÂêÑÁΩÆÈÉΩÁù£‰∫î‰∫∫ÔºåÁµ±ËôüÂçÅ‰∏ÄÈÉ®ËêΩ\\" tr. \\"There are eleven tutuqs.

Chinese intervention in the affairs of Western Turkestan ceased after their defeat at the Battle of Talas in 751 by the Arab general Ziyad ibn Salih. The Arabs dislodged the Karluks from Fergana. In 766, after they overran the Turgesh in Zhetysu, the Karluk tribes formed a Khanate under the rule of a Yabgu, occupied Suyab and transferred their capital there. By that time the bulk of the tribe had left the Altai, and the supremacy in Zhetysu passed to the Karluks. Their ruler with the title Yabgu is often mentioned in the Orkhon inscriptions. In Pahlavi texts one of the Karluk rulers of Tocharistan was called Yabbu-Hakan (Yabgu-Kagan).Marquart J., \\"Provincial Capitals\\", Rome, 1931, p. 10 The fall of the Western Turkic Kaganate left Zhetysu in the possession of Turkic peoples, independent of either Arabs or Chinese. In 822, the Uyghurs sent four Karluks as tribute to Tang dynasty China. Culture The Karluks were hunters, nomadic herdsmen, and agriculturists. They settled in the countryside and in the cities, which were centered on trading posts along the caravan roads. The Karluks inherited a vast multi-ethnic region, whose diverse population was not much different from its rulers. Zhetysu was populated by several tribes: the Azes (mentioned in the Orkhon inscriptions) and the Tuhsi, remnants of the T√ºrgesh;Gumilyov, L. Searches for an Imaginary Kingdom: The trefoil of the Bird's Eye View' Ch. 5: The Shattered Silence (961-1100)Pylypchuk, Ya. \\"Turks and Muslims: From Confrontation to Conversion to Islam (End of VII century - Beginning of XI Century)\\" in UDK 94 (4): 95 (4).

[Vol. 4] and the interspersing Sogdian colonies. The southern part of Zhetysu was occupied by the Yagma people, who also held Kashgar. In the north and west lived the Kankalis. Chigils, who had joined and been a significant division of the Three-Karluks, then detached and resided around Issyk Kul. The diverse population adhered to a spectrum of religious beliefs. The Karluks and the majority of the Turkic population professed Tengrianism, considered as shamanism and by the Christians and Muslims. Chigils were Christians of the Nestorian denomination. The majority of the Toquz Oghuz, with their khan, were Manicheans, but there were also Christians, Buddhists, and Muslims among them. The peaceful penetration of Muslim culture through commercial relations played a far more important role in their conversion than Muslim arms. The merchants were followed by missionaries of various creeds, including Nestorian Christians. Many Turkestan towns had Christian churches. The Turks held sacred the Qastek pass mountains, believing to be an abode of the deity. Each creed carried its script, resulting in a variety of used scripts, including T√ºrkic runiform, Sogdian, Syriac, and later the Uygur. The Karluks had adopted and developed the Turkic literary language of Khoresm, established in Bukhara and Samarkand, which after Mongol conquest became known as the Chagatai language. Of all Turkic peoples, the Karluk were most open to the influence of Muslim culture. Yaqubi reported the conversion of the Karluk-yabgu to Islam under Caliph Mahdi (775-785), and by the 10th century, several towns to the east of Talas had mosques. Muslim culture had affected the general way of life of the Karluks.W. Barthold, \\"Four Studies In History Of Central Asia\\", Leiden, E. J. Brill, 1962, p.91 During the next three centuries, the Karluk Yabgu state occupied a key position on the choice international trade route, fighting off mostly Turkic competitors to retain their prime position. Their biggest adversaries were Kangars in the north-west and Toquz Oghuz in the south-east, with a period of Samanid raids to Zhetysu in 840-894\\\\. But even in the heyday of the Karluk Yabgu state, parts of its domains were in the hands of the Toquz Oghuz, and later under Kyrgyz and Khitan control, increasing the ethnical, religious, and political diversity.W. Barthold, \\"Four Studies In History Of Central Asia\\", Leiden, E. J. Brill, 1962, pp. 92‚Äì102 Social organization The state of Karluk Yabgu was an association of semi- independent districts and cities, each equipped with its own militia. The biggest was the capital Suyab, which could turn out 20,000 warriors, and among other districts, the town of Beglilig (known as \\"Samakna\\" before Karluk ruleW. Barthold, \\"Four Studies In History Of Central Asia\\", Leiden, E. J. Brill, 1962, pp. 88‚Äì89) had 10,000 warriors, Panjikat could turn out 8,000 warriors, Barskhan 6,000 warriors, and Yar 3,000 warriors. The titles of the petty rulers were Qutegin of the Karluk Laban clan in Karminkat, Taksin in Jil, Tabin-Barskhan in Barskhan, Turkic Yindl-Tegin and Sogdian Badan-Sangu in Beglilig. The prince of Suyab, situated north of the Chu river in the Turgesh land, was a brother of one of the G√∂kt√ºrk khans, but bore the Persian title Yalan-shah, i.e. \\"King of Heroes\\". Muslim authors describe in detail the trade route from Western Asia to China across Zhetysu, mentioning many cities. Some bore double names, both Turkic and Sogdian. They wrote about the capital cities of Balasagun, Suyab, and Kayalik, in which William of Rubruck saw three Buddhist temples in the Muslim town for the first time. The geographers also mentioned Taraz (Talas, Auliya-ata), Navekat (now Karabulak), Atbash (now Koshoy-Kurgan ruins), Issyk-kul, Barskhan, Panjikat, Akhsikat, Beglilig, Almalik, Jul, Yar, Ton, Panchul, and others. =Kirghiz period= Prior to the Kirghiz-Uyghur war of 829-840, the Kirghiz lived in the upper basin of the Yenisei River. Linguistically their language, together with the Altai language, belongs to a separate Kirghiz group of the Turkic language family. At that time they had an estimated population of 250,000 and an army of 50,000. Kirghiz victory in the war brought them to the Karluk door. They captured Tuva, Altai, a part of Dzungaria, and reached Kashgar. Allied with the Karluks against the Uygurs, in the 840s the Kirghiz started the occupation of that part of Zhetysu which is their present home. Karluk independence ended around 840. They fell from dominating the tribal association to a subordinate position. The Kirghiz remained a power in Zhetysu until their destruction by the Kara-Khitans in 1124, when most of them evacuated from their center in Tuva back to the Minusinsk Depression, leaving the Karluks to predominate again in Zhetysu. The position of the Karluk state, based on the rich Zhetysu cities, remained strong, despite the failures in wars in the beginning of the 9th century. Yabgu was enriched by profitable trade in slaves on the Syr-Darya slave markets, selling guards for the Abbasid Caliphs, and control over the transit road to China in the sector from Taraz to Issyk Kul. The Karluk position in Fergana, despite Arab attempts to expel them, became stronger.S. G. Klyashtorny, T. I. Sultanov, ‚ÄúStates And Peoples Of The Eurasian Steppe‚Äù, St. Petersburg , 2004, p.116, The fall of the last Kagan with its capital in √ñt√ºken, which dominated for three centuries, created a completely new geopolitical situation in all Central Asia. For the first time in three hundred years, the powerful center of authority that created opportunities for expansion or even existence of any state in Turkestan had finally disappeared. Henceforth, the Turkic tribes recognized only the high status of the clan that inherited the Kagan title, but never again his unifying authority. Several Muslim historians state that after the loss by the Uygurs of their power (840), the supreme authority among the Turkic tribes passed to the Karluk leaders. Connection with the Ashina clan, the ruling clan of the Turkic Kaganate, allowed the Karluk dynasty to dress their authority with legitimate attire, and, abandoning the old title Yabgu, to take on the new title of Kagan.S. G. Klyashtorny, T. I. Sultanov, ‚ÄúStates And Peoples Of The Eurasian Steppe‚Äù, St. Petersburg , 2004, p.117, =Karakhanid period= Towards 940 the \\"heathen‚Äù Yagma from the southern border seized the Chu valley and the Karluk capital Balasagun. The Yagma ruler bore the title Bogra-khan (Camel Khan), very common among Karakhanids. The Yagma quickly proceeded to take control of all Karluk lands. In the 10th and 12th centuries, the lands on both sides of the principal chain of the Tian Shan were united under the rule of the Karakhanid Ilek-khans (Khans of the Land) or simply Karakhanids (Great Khans). The Karakhanid state was divided into fiefs which soon became independent.W. Barthold, \\"Four Studies In History Of Central Asia\\", Leiden, E. J. Brill, 1962, pp. 22, 93‚Äì102 The Kara-Khanid Khanate was founded in the 9th century from a confederation of Karluks, Chigils, Yagmas, and other tribes. Later in the 10th century a Karakhanid Sultan Satuq Bughra Khan converted to Islam. His son Musa made Islam a state religion in 960. The empire occupied modern northern Iran and parts of Central Asia. This region remained under Karakhanid, and for varying periods it remained an independent vassal of Seljuk and Kara-Khitan. The Karakhanid khanate ended when the last ruler of its western Khanate was killed by the Khwarezmids in 1212. Both the Kara- Khitans and the Khwarezmids were later destroyed by the Mongol invasion. The name KhƒÅqƒÅniyya was given to the Qarluks who inhabited KƒÅshghar and BƒÅlƒÅsƒÅgh≈´n, the inhabitants were not Uighur however their language has been retroactively labelled as Uighur by scholars. =Khitan period= At the beginning of the 10th century, a tribe related to the Mongols, the Khitans with an admixture of Mongols, founded a vast empire, stretching from the Pacific to Lake Baikal and the Tian Shan, displacing the Turkic population. The Khitan language has been classified as para-Mongolic: distantly related to the Mongolic languages of the Mongols. Reportedly, the first Gurkhan was a Manichaean. Owing to its long sway over China, the ruling dynasty, which the Twenty-Four Histories call the Liao dynasty (916‚Äì1125), was strongly influenced by Chinese culture. In 1125, a Tungusic people, the Jurchen, allied with the Southern Song, ending the domination of the Khitan. The Khitan exiles, headed by Yel√º Dashi, a member of the Khitan royal family, migrated to the West. The Khitan settled in the Tarbagatai Mountains east of Zhetysu, and their number grew to 40,000 tents. Around 1130 the local Karakhanid ruler of Balasagun asked for their aid against the hostile Kankalis and Karluks. The Khitan occupied Balasaghun, expelled the weak Karakhanid ruler, and founded their own state, which stretched from the Yenisei to Taraz. They then conquered Kankali and subdued Xinjiang. In 1137 near Khujand they defeated the Transoxanian Karakhanid ruler Mahmud Khan, who then appealed to their suzerain the Seljuks for help. The Kara-Khitans, who were also invited by the Khwarazmians (then also a vassal of the Seljuks) to conquer the lands of the Seljuks as well as in response to an appeal to intervene by the Karluks who were involved in a conflict with the Karakhanids, then advanced to Samarkand. In 1141, the Seljuks under Ahmad Sanjar also arrived in Samarkand with his army, but was defeated by the Kara-Khitans in the Battle of Qatwan, after which the Kara-Khitans became dominant in Transoxania. The western Khitan state became known under its Turkic name, the Kara-Khitan Khanate and their ruler bore the Turkic title Gurkhan \\"Khan‚Äôs son-in law\\". The original Uch- Karluk confederation became split between the Karakhanid state in the west and the Karakhitay state in the east, lasting until the Mongol invasion. Both in the west and east, Karluk principalities retained their autonomous status and indigenous rulers, though in Karakhitay the Karluk khan, like the ruler of Samarkand, was forced to accept the presence of a permanent representative of the Gurkhan. The Gurkhans administered limited territories, populated in 1170 by 84,500 families under direct rule. The Gurkhan's headquarters was called Khosun-ordu (lit. \\"Strong Ordu\\"), or Khoto (\\"House\\"). The Karluk capital was Kayalik. The Karakhanids continued to rule over Transoxania and western Xinjiang. The Kara-khitans did not interfere with the religion of the people, but Islam became less dominant as the other religions took advantage of the new freedom to increase the number of their adherents. The Nestorian Patriarch Elias III (1176‚Äì1190) founded a religious metropole in Kashgar. The Karakhitay metropolitan bore the title Metropolitan of Kashghar and Navakat, showing that the see of Kashghar also controlled the southern part of Zhetysu. The oldest Nestorian tombs in the Tokmak and Pishpek cemeteries go back to the epoch of Karakhitay domination. Ata-Malik Juvayni however stressed the oppression of Muslims by Kuchlug, a son of the last Nayman khan who was ousted (towards 1204) by Mongolia by Genghis Khan. The Nayman Nestorian Christian K√ºchl√ºk usurped the throne of the Kara-Khitans. In 1211, a Mongol detachment under the command of Khubilai Noyon, one of Genghis Khan's generals, appeared in the northern part of Zhetysu. Arslan-khan Karluk killed the Karakhitay governor of Kayalik and proclaimed his loyalty to Genghis Khan. The Zhetysu, together with Eastern Turkestan, voluntarily surrendered to the Mongols. Kuchlug was killed by the invading Mongols in 1218. = Mongol era = In the 1211 a Mongol detachment under command of Khubilai noyon, one of Genghis Khan's generals, appeared in the northern part of Zhetysu. Arslan Khan Karluk, probably the son of Arslan khan and brother of Mamdu khan, killed the Khitan governor of Kayalik and proclaimed his loyalty to Genghis Khan. The Collection of Annals records that Genghis Khan removed his title from Karluk Arslan Khan: \\"Let your name be Sartaktai\\", i.e. Sart, said the sovereign. After the absorption of the Kara-Khanid Khanate by the Chagatai Khanate, the ethnonym Karluk became rarely used. The Karluk language was the primary basis for the later lingua-franca of the Chagatai Khanate and Central Asia under the Timurid dynasty. It is therefore designated by linguists and historians as the Chagatai language, but its contemporaries, such as Timur and Babur, simply called it Turki. =Modern period= In the 20th century, the geopolitical Great Game among great powers demanded the creation of modern nationalities among Central Asian Turks. The ethnonym \\"Karluk\\" was not revived. Instead, Uzbek and Uyghur became the two major divisions among speakers of modern variants of the Chagatai language. Under these two modern nationalities, there are subgroups like the Uyghur Dolan, Aynur and several regional populations of Uzbeks. Some of the Uzbeks share more similarities with Kipchak groups like the Karakalpak and Kazakhs, or with the Iranian Tajiks, than with fellow Uzbeks who speak a descendant of the Karluk language. Genetics A genetic study published in Nature in May 2018 examined the remains of two Karluk males buried at Butakty in the Tian Shan between 800 AD and 1000 AD. One male carried the paternal haplogroup J2a and the maternal haplogroup A, while the other carried the maternal haplogroup F1b1e.

Considered one of the most famous and recognized monster trucks of all time, Grave Digger serves as the flagship team of the Monster Jam series, with seven active Grave Digger trucks being driven by different drivers to allow a truck to appear at every Monster Jam event.  History  Grave Digger was originally built in 1982 by Dennis Anderson as a mud bogger. This first truck was assembled from salvaged parts, including the body of a red 1957 Ford pickup truck. The truck received its name when Anderson, amicably retorting trash talking from his fellow racers about the truck's salvaged parts, said, \\"I'll take this old junk and dig you a grave with it.\\" Anderson gained a reputation for an all-or-nothing driving style and quickly became popular at local events. At one show, a scheduled monster truck failed to show up and Anderson, who already had large tractor tires on the truck, offered to crush cars in the absence of the full- size monster. The promoter accepted and Grave Digger was an instant success as a car crusher and led Anderson to leave mud bogging and pursue monster trucks instead. In 1984 Anderson rebuilt the truck as a true monster truck using a 1951 Ford panel van body originally sporting a silver and blue paint scheme. In 1986 Grave Digger first received its famous black graveyard paint scheme. In 1987 and 1988 Anderson drove the truck primarily at TNT Motorsports races and became a crowd favorite for driving hard despite lacking major funding that better-known teams, like Bigfoot, had. In 1987, Anderson beat Bigfoot in Saint Paul, Minnesota, on a show taped for ESPN. It was the first major victory for Grave Digger. Anderson moved to Grave Digger 2 in 1989, with a new 1950 Chevy panel van body, while his brother Leslie Anderson drove Grave Digger 1. It was during this time that the reputation for wild passes was developed, and the popularity of the truck increased. It was also during this time that \\"Bad To The Bone\\" began to be used as the truck's theme song. TNT recognised his rising popularity and began promoting Grave Digger heavily, especially for races on the Tuff Trax syndicated television series. This was helped by Bigfoot not racing for points in the 1989 championship, leaving Grave Digger as the most popular truck on the tour. When TNT became a part of the United States Hot Rod Association in 1991, Anderson began running on the USHRA tour and debuted his first four-link truck, Grave Digger 3. Throughout the 1990s, the popularity of the truck grew and forced Anderson to hire other drivers to run other Grave Digger trucks. Grave Diggers 4, 5 and 8 were built to suit this purpose, and were never driven in any major capacity by Anderson. Anderson drove Grave Digger 7, a direct successor to 3, for most of the decade. It was replaced by Grave Digger 12, well known as the \\"long wheelbase Digger\\", which was also the first Grave Digger with purple in the paint job. In 1993, Dennis Anderson and Grave Digger #7 were heavily featured on the TV series Monster Wars. Anderson led the beginning of the season until breakages and disqualifications; he finished 5th. That year, Anderson won the 2nd USHRA wreck of the year title after he won and rolled over in Lebanon Valley Speedway, racing UFO. There was footage inside the cab of Anderson uttering his famous catch-saying ‚ÄúYea we turned er over, she‚Äôs over, that‚Äôs what the people want, that‚Äôs what they got, I got a torn up truck!‚Äù In late 1998, Anderson sold the Grave Digger team to Pace Motorsports (now Feld Entertainment). Anderson continued to drive, being the most visible member of the team, and remained in charge of drivers and of training team members. Anderson competed in his final event on January 14, 2017 at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida. On September 18, 2017, Dennis announced his full retirement from Monster Jam, stating however that he would still be behind the scenes and in the pits.

There are seven trucks currently competing. *Grave Digger #1 ‚Äì The original truck was first built as a mud racing truck from a 1957 Ford pickup, then rebuilt as a true monster truck in 1985 using a 1951 Ford panel van body. The rebuilt version, nicknamed \\"Grandma\\", is on display at the Digger's Dungeon shop. A replica of the original configuration using parts saved from the rebuild was assembled to make an appearance at World Finals 8 in 2007 as part of a 25th anniversary celebration of Grave Digger. It is also on display at Digger's Dungeon. *Grave Digger #2 ‚Äì Built in 1989 from a 1950 Chevrolet panel van, which became the model for all subsequent Grave Digger bodies. The steel body was soon replaced by a fiberglass replica. It was heavily damaged in a crash that snapped its frame in late 1990, and retired from full-time competition. In 1994, parts, including the original steel body, were used to construct a special truck to allow Dennis Anderson to perform a water crossing charity stunt. Fully restored in 2016 by Adam Anderson using the original body, it is on display at Digger's Dungeon. *Grave Digger #3 ‚Äì Debuted in 1991. First truck to use a steel-tube-framed, four-link-suspension chassis. It was sold in late 1999. *Grave Digger #4 ‚Äì This truck was operated from 1991 to 1993 by Jack Koberna as part of a franchise agreement for West Coast events. It was built with a traditional frame and leaf-spring suspension chassis with a fiberglass body. After Koberna's franchise ended, Pablo Huffaker signed a similar deal, and used his second Jus' Show'N Off truck (a tube-framed truck built in 1991) with the body from #4. Huffaker drove it as Grave Digger from 1993 to 1995. *Grave Digger #5 ‚Äì Built in 1991 using a new frame with parts salvaged from #2, including the fiberglass replica body and leaf-spring suspension. It was only used until 1992, and became a display truck. Parts were removed for the restoration of #2, and the frame sold. *Grave Digger #6 ‚Äì Built in 1991 as the \\"Street Digger\\", a street-legal display truck. *Grave Digger #7 ‚Äì Debuted in 1992, extensively rebuilt in 1999, and retired in 2005. Currently on permanent display at Digger's Dungeon. *Grave Digger #8 ‚Äì Debuted in 1992, retired in 2005. Used as a display truck as part of Cedar Fair amusement parks' \\"Monster Jam Thunder Alley\\" experience in 2019. *Grave Digger #9 ‚Äì Built in 1994 as a ride truck, it was sold and is now the ride truck Extinguisher. *Grave Digger #10 ‚Äì Built in 1995 by Pablo Huffaker. Became Radical Rescue in 2001 before being retired in 2004. *Grave Digger #11 ‚Äì Built in 1996 as a ride truck. It was rebuilt in 2013 and currently runs as a Grave Digger ride truck. *Grave Digger #12 ‚Äì Debuted in 1996. Originally retired in 2010 as a Grave Digger after a crash in Wildwood, New Jersey, the truck was refurbished and ran as Grave Digger the Legend in 2011 as a backup truck before being finally retired that year. *Grave Digger #13 ‚Äì Skipped per superstitions regarding the number 13, but used as a nickname for Grave Digger #7 after its substantial rebuild. *Grave Digger #14 ‚Äì Debuted in 2001. Retired in 2010 following a crash in Philadelphia. *Grave Digger #15 ‚Äì Debuted 2001, retired in 2009. Currently on display at Digger's Dungeon. *Grave Digger #16 ‚Äì Built 2002 by Pablo Huffaker, retired in 2013. *Grave Digger #17 ‚Äì Pro Modified drag racer sponsored by the team. (The IHRA and USHRA were previously under the same ownership.) No longer racing. *Grave Digger #18 ‚Äì Debuted 2003, retired in 2013. *Grave Digger #19 ‚Äì Debuted 2004, retired in 2014. *Grave Digger #20 ‚Äì Debuted 2005, retired in 2013. *Grave Digger #21 ‚Äì Display truck. The truck is mounted in a trailer where fans can sit in the cab of the truck. *Grave Digger #22 ‚Äì Originally ran as the Batman monster truck from 2006 to 2008 before becoming Grave Digger #22. Retired in 2013. *Grave Digger #23 ‚Äì Debuted 2011, retired in 2017. *Grave Digger #24 ‚Äì Debuted 2011, retired in 2016. *Grave Digger #25 ‚Äì Debuted 2011, retired in 2016. *Grave Digger #26 ‚Äì Debuted 2013, retired in 2016. *Grave Digger #27 ‚Äì Debuted 2014, retired in 2018. *Grave Digger #28 ‚Äì Built by Pablo Huffaker in 2014. Retired from competition in May 2018 when Huffaker retired as a driver. Now a display truck. *Grave Digger #29 ‚Äì Debuted 2015. Currently serves as a back-up truck, used mostly for international shows. *Grave Digger #30 ‚Äì Debuted 2014. Retired in 2018 when Dennis Anderson retired, as this was the last truck he personally drove. *Grave Digger #31 ‚Äì Debuted 2016. Currently serves as a back-up truck. *Grave Digger #32 ‚Äì Originally built in 2011 as \\"Grave Digger: The Legend\\", a retro-themed truck driven by Adam Anderson through the 2015 season, it was renamed and numbered in 2016 when Adam Anderson joined the Grave Digger team full time. Retired in 2018. *Grave Digger #33 ‚Äì Debuted 2017. Currently driven by Morgan Kane. *Grave Digger #34 ‚Äì Debuted 2017. Currently driven by Krysten Anderson. *Grave Digger #35 ‚Äì Debuted 2017.

Currently driven by Brandon Vinson.  Hallmarks  Grave Digger is well known for its damaging crashes. Grave Digger's origins, the imagery associated with the truck, and the truck's wild reputation, are all considered part of the mystique of the truck and have contributed to its continued popularity. The paint scheme, which combines green flames, letters dripping blood, a foggy graveyard scene with tombstones bearing names of competitors, a haunted house silhouetted by a full moon, and a giant skull-shaped ghost, has not strayed far from the first incarnation of the paintwork from 1986. Perhaps the most visible trademark is the red headlights which glow menacingly whenever the truck is in competition. The lights were first used when Anderson was building a transporter out of a school bus and removed the red stop lights. After realizing they would fit in the headlights of the van, he installed them and the truck has had them ever since. alt= Anderson became known for destructive qualifying passes which entertained the crowd but on many occasions put the truck out of competition for the rest of the event. With the advent of freestyle, Anderson gained a means by which he could entertain the crowd with wild stunts while also focusing on winning races. Today, Grave Digger, no matter which driver is appearing, is traditionally the last truck to freestyle at most events, providing the \\"grand finale\\" which caps off the show. The immense popularity of Grave Digger has made it the flagship truck of Monster Jam, and in some cases monster trucks in general. There is much debate over whether Grave Digger has taken over the title of \\"Most Popular Monster Truck\\" from Bigfoot. As a result, the Grave Digger vs. Bigfoot rivalry is one of the strongest in the sport, despite the fact that the teams have not raced each other regularly since the late 1990s.

The lyrics tell of a man who is on the run and planning to head to Mexico after shooting his unfaithful wife. In 1962, Billy Roberts registered \\"Hey Joe\\" for copyright in the United States. In late 1965, Los Angeles garage band the Leaves recorded the earliest known commercial version of \\"Hey Joe\\", which was released as a single. They re-recorded the song and released it in 1966 as a follow-up single, which became a hit in the US. In October 1966, Jimi Hendrix recorded \\"Hey Joe\\" for his first single with the Jimi Hendrix Experience. Their version became a hit in the UK. Authorship The authorship of the song has been contested, and different recordings have credited its writing to either Billy Roberts or Dino Valenti, or have listed it as a traditional song. \\"Hey Joe\\" was registered for copyright in the US in 1962 by Billy Roberts, a California-based folk musician. Scottish folk singer Len Partridge has claimed that he helped write the song with Roberts when they both performed in clubs in Edinburgh in 1956. Roberts may have drawn inspiration for \\"Hey Joe\\" from three earlier works: the song \\"Baby, Please Don‚Äôt Go to Town\\" written by his girlfriend Niela Horn (later Miller), which uses a similar chord progression based on the circle of fifths;Tom Leonardi, \\"Folk Music, the Musical Industrial Complex, and ‚ÄúHey Joe.‚Äù, KZFR.org, September 4, 2014.

Niela Horn Miller's song \\"Baby Don't Go to Town\\" was recorded as a demo tape in 1962, but was not released until 2009 when it appeared on her LP Songs of Leaving. Patrick Sullivan, Review of Songs of Leaving, Allmusic.com. Retrieved 2 April 2020 The lyrics to \\"Little Sadie\\" often locate the events in Thomasville, North Carolina, and \\"down in\\" Jericho, South Carolina (a large rice plantation in the lowlands); Roberts was born in South Carolina. Variations of \\"Little Sadie\\" have been recorded under various titles (including \\"Bad Lee Brown\\", \\"Penitentiary Blues\\", \\"Cocaine Blues\\", \\"Whiskey Blues\\") by many artists, including Clarence Ashley (1930), Johnny Cash (1960 and 1968), Slim Dusty (1961), and Bob Dylan (1970). Some versions change the southbound location from Jericho (South Carolina) to Mexico. Billy Roberts performed \\"Hey Joe\\" regularly in the late 1950s and early 1960s, without copyrighting it, and some other performers including Pete Seeger recognised that it had been developed from Niela Miller's song. In 1962, Roberts registered the song as his composition at the Library of Congress, and recorded a demo tape of it. Niela Miller separately registered some of her songs, including \\"Baby, Please Don‚Äôt Go to Town\\". Seeger offered to testify on her behalf so she could claim part of the credit for \\"Hey Joe\\", but this was not pursued. Roberts also played the song when touring with his friend Dino Valenti. When Valenti moved to California in 1963 he began performing it himself, and copyrighted it in Los Angeles as his own composition. Roberts later regained the composing credit, but a share of the publishing income was retained by the Los Angeles publishing company. Other sources (including singer Pat Craig) claim that Roberts assigned the rights to the song to his friend Valenti while Valenti was in jail, in order to give him some income upon release. Rights to the song were administered from 1966 into the 2000s by the music publisher Third Story Music (now Third Palm Music); there the author is listed as Billy Roberts. Singer Tim Rose recorded the song in 1966, and it was credited as a traditional song. No documentary evidence has been forthcoming to support an assertion that \\"Hey Joe\\" is a wholly traditional work.Tim Rose made a similar claim regarding the authorship of \\"Morning Dew\\". Rose later told writer Richie Unterberger that he had learned the song in 1960 from folk singer Vince Martin. Early recordings (1965‚Äì1966) Roberts' song gained fans in the Los Angeles music scene of the mid-1960s, which led to fast-paced recordings in 1965 and 1966 by the Leaves, the Standells, the Surfaris, Love, the Music Machine, and the Byrds, swiftly making the song a garage rock classic. Both Valenti and the Byrds' David Crosby have been reported as helping to popularize the song before it was recorded by the Leaves in December 1965. The Leaves, who had been introduced to the song while attending performances by the Byrds (who had yet to record their own version of the song) at Ciro's in Los Angeles, recorded and released three versions of \\"Hey Joe\\" between 1965 and 1966. Their first version was released in November/December 1965, but sold poorly. The band's third recorded version of the song became a hit in May/June 1966, reaching No. 31 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and No. 29 on the Canadian RPM Magazine charts. The Leaves' version is notable for being the only recording of the song to reach the Top 40 of the Billboard chart. The Surfaris recording of the song, released on the B-side of their \\"So Get Out\\" single, is sometimes cited as being the first rock recording of the song, but a number of reliable sources contend that the Surfaris' version dates from 1966, well after the Leaves' original 1965 version. There is some dispute over exactly when the Surfaris' recording of the song was released. Some sources list its release date as being late 1965 and other sources list it as being June 1966. However, the catalogue number of the Surfaris' single is Decca 31954, which when cross-referenced with other contemporaneous Decca single releases, allows the release to be conclusively dated to a May‚ÄìJune 1966 time frame. A June 1966 release date is further corroborated by the discographical information on the website of the single's producer, Gary Usher. Three other Los Angeles bands recorded the song in 1966: the Standells with the title \\"Hey Joe, Where You Gonna Go\\", included it on their 1966 Dirty Water album; the Music Machine recorded a slow, moody, fuzz- laden version of the song in late 1966; and Love included a version on their debut album, Love, recorded in January 1966 and released on Elektra Records in April. Love's Bryan MacLean was introduced to the song by David Crosby during 1965, while MacLean had been a roadie for the Byrds. Love's lead vocalist, Arthur Lee, claimed in later years that it was Love's version that turned Jimi Hendrix on to the song as well as most of the other Los Angeles acts who covered the song. Love's recording of \\"Hey Joe\\" features slightly different lyrics than most versions of the song; for example, the lyric \\"gun in your hand\\" became \\"money in your hand\\" in Love's version. The Byrds recording of the song also features the same altered lyrics as Love's version. Love guitarist Johnny Echols claims that Love's and the Byrds' lyrics are the authentic ones. According to Echols, the Leaves (with whom they were friends) had heard Love performing the song and asked them for the lyrics. He rewrote them to play the Leaves a \\"dirty trick\\", accidentally authoring the version that everybody got to know. Also in 1966, the Chicago-based garage-punk band Shadows Of Knight released a nearly six minute long rave-up version of the song on their second LP, Back Door Men.  The Byrds version  The Byrds included a recording of the song, titled \\"Hey Joe (Where You Gonna Go)\\", on their 1966 album, Fifth Dimension. The lead vocalist on the Byrds' version was David Crosby, who was instrumental in bringing the song to the group and in popularizing the song within the larger L.A. music community. Crosby had wanted to record the song almost since the band first formed in 1964 but the other members of the Byrds had been unenthusiastic about the song. By the time of the recording sessions for Fifth Dimension, several other bands had enjoyed success with covers of \\"Hey Joe\\", leaving Crosby angered by his bandmates' lack of faith in the song. Byrds' guitarist and band leader Roger McGuinn recalled in an interview that \\"The reason Crosby did lead (vocal) on 'Hey Joe' was because it was his song. He didn't write it but he was responsible for finding it. He'd wanted to do it for years but we would never let him. Then both Love and the Leaves had a minor hit with it and David got so angry that we had to let him do it.\\" General consensus within the band and among critics was that the Byrds' version wasn't an entirely successful reading of the song and was inferior to previous recordings of the song by Love and the Leaves. In later years, both McGuinn and the band's manager, Jim Dickson, criticised Crosby's vocal performance on the song for not being powerful enough to carry the aggressive subject matter and expressed regret that the song had been included on Fifth Dimension. Crosby himself later admitted that the recording of the song was an error on his part, stating \\"It was a mistake, I shouldn't have done it. Everybody makes mistakes.\\" The song would go on to become a staple of the Byrds' live concert repertoire during 1966 and 1967. The band also included the song in their performance at the Monterey Pop Festival, which is included on the 2002 The Complete Monterey Pop Festival DVD box set as well as on the 1992 The Monterey International Pop Festival CD box set. = Personnel = * David Crosby ‚Äì lead vocals, rhythm guitar * Roger McGuinn ‚Äì 12-string lead guitar * Chris Hillman ‚Äì bass guitar * Michael Clarke ‚Äì drums, cowbell Tim Rose and Jimi Hendrix (1966) Folk rock singer Tim Rose‚Äôs slower version of the song (recorded in 1966 and claimed to be Rose's arrangement of a wholly traditional song) inspired the first single by the Jimi Hendrix Experience. The ex-bassist for the Animals, Chas Chandler, who was now focusing on managing other acts, had also seen Rose performing the song at the Cafe Wha? in New York City and was looking for an artist to record a rock version of \\"Hey Joe\\". Chandler discovered Jimi Hendrix, who had also been playing at the Cafe Wha? in 1966 and performing an arrangement of \\"Hey Joe\\" inspired by Rose's rendition. Chandler decided to take Hendrix with him to England in September 1966, where he would subsequently turn the guitarist into a star. Rose re-recorded \\"Hey Joe\\" in the 1990s, re-titling it \\"Blue Steel .44\\" and again claimed the song as his own arrangement of a traditional song. Some accounts credit the slower version of the song by the British band the Creation as being the inspiration for Hendrix's version; Chandler and Hendrix saw them perform the song after Hendrix arrived in the UK, although the Creation's version was not released until after Hendrix's. It is unclear if the members of the Creation had heard Tim Rose's version. Released in December 1966, Hendrix's version became a hit in the United Kingdom, entering the Top 10 of the UK Singles Chart in January 1967 and peaking at No. 6. The single was released in the United States on May 1, 1967 with the B-side \\"51st Anniversary\\", but failed to chart. Nevertheless, \\"Hey Joe\\" as recorded by the Jimi Hendrix Experience, with backing vocals by the Breakaways, remains the best-known version of the song and is listed as No. 201 on Rolling Stone magazine's The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. In 2000, Total Guitar magazine ranked it as the 13th greatest cover version of all time. In 2009 it was named the 22nd greatest hard rock song of all time by VH1. \\"Hey Joe\\" was the last song Hendrix performed at the Woodstock festival in 1969 and as such, it was also the final song of the whole festival. The song was performed after the crowd, comprising the 80,000 who had not yet left the festival, cheered for an encore. Later recordings / live performances (1967‚Äìpresent) Cher recorded a version of \\"Hey Joe\\" on Imperial Records in late 1966, which peaked at number 94 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. It was included on her 1967 album, With Love, Ch√©r. An AllMusic review noted that her version \\"makes for some fun\\" but was \\"not so spectacular\\" and \\"clearly the wrong material for this great singer.\\" French singer Johnny Hallyday covered the song in French in 1966. His version reached No. 2 in Wallonia (French-speaking Belgium).Ultratop.be - Johnny Hallyday - \\"Hey Joe\\" Marmalade recorded a version of the song in 1968 because they needed a B-side to their single \\"Lovin' Things\\" in a hurry, and because they thought it was a traditional song and as such, the band would get the songwriting royalties from it. Marmalade guitarist Junior Campbell stated in interview that \\"Jimi Hendrix's version had already sold about 200,000 copies and then we sold about 300,000 on the flip of 'Lovin' Thing'. But then the following year, the bloke who'd written the bloody song suddenly turned up out of the woodwork!\\". Frank Zappa recorded a parody of the song, titled \\"Flower Punk\\", on the Mothers of Invention album We're Only in It for the Money in 1968. The song was one of several on the album that parodied the fashionable hippie lifestyle. Lyrics in Zappa's version included \\"Hey Punk, where you goin' with that flower in your hand?/Well, I'm goin' up to Frisco to join a psychedelic band.\\" Wilson Pickett released a version of the song that reached No. 59 on the US Hot 100 in August 1969,Billboard, August 9, 1969, p. 102. No. 29 on the US R&B; chart, No. 42 on the Canadian RPM magazine chart, and No. 16 on the UK chart. His version featured Duane Allman on guitar. Patti Smith released a cover of \\"Hey Joe\\" as the A-side of her first single, backed with \\"Piss Factory\\", in 1974. Her version is unique in that she includes a brief and salacious monologue about fugitive heiress Patty Hearst and her kidnapping and participation with the Symbionese Liberation Army. Smith's version portrays Hearst as Joe with a \\"gun in her hand\\". Sonic Youth's song \\"Hey Joni\\", included on their 1988 album, Daydream Nation, is titled in reference to \\"Hey Joe\\" and to Joni Mitchell, but it shares no lyrical themes with the Billy Roberts song. Charlotte Gainsbourg performed the song on the soundtrack of Lars Von Trier's film Nymphomaniac, in which she starred as a character named Joe. 1,881 guitarists played \\"Hey Joe\\" in Wroc≈Çaw on May 1, 2007, setting what was, at the time, a new Guinness record. 1,572 guitarists played \\"Hey Joe\\" simultaneously in the town square of Wroc≈Çaw, Poland on May 1, 2006, breaking a Guinness record. A new record was set when 1,881 guitarists played \\"Hey Joe\\" in Wroc≈Çaw on May 1, 2007. Then on May 1, 2008, 1,951 guitarists played \\"Hey Joe\\" in Wroc≈Çaw to set a new world record. The record was further broken in Wroc≈Çaw on May 1, 2009, when 6,346 guitarists played the song in the same venue. A new record was set on May 1, 2012, when 7,273 guitarists turned out in Wroc≈Çaw.

Although a work of fiction, Melville included sequences of chapters concerned largely with a pseudo-objective discussion of the properties of whales. The observations, based on a list of sources in addition to Melville's own experiences in whaling in the 1840s, include observations of various species from the order of Cetacea. These chapters are the most likely to be omitted in abridged versions of the novel. Description Ishmael's observations are not a complete scientific study, even by standards of the day. Nevertheless, because of the general lack of knowledge about whales in the middle 19th century, the taxonomy in the novel provides a glimpse of the knowledge of whales by the whaling fleet and naturalists of the era. Ishmael somewhat famously asserts in the novel that the whale is a \\"spouting fish with a horizontal tail\\". He attempts a taxonomy of whales largely based on size, based on his assertion that other characteristics, such as the existence of a hump or baleen, make the classification too confusing. Borrowing an analogy from publishing and bookbinding, he divides whales into three \\"books\\", called the Folio Whale (largest), Octavo Whale and the Duodecimo Whale (smaller), represented respectively by the sperm whale, the orca (which he calls the grampus) and the porpoise. Each such book is then divided into \\"chapters\\" representing a separate species. By the current taxonomy of Cetacea, the classification in Moby-Dick is inaccurate and incomplete as well, presenting only a fraction of the nearly ninety species of Cetaceans known today. In the case of some species, in particular the blue whale (which Ishmael calls the \\"sulphur-bottom whale\\"), very little was known at the time. The classification is thus heavily weighted toward whales hunted for oil and other uses, and presents a picture of the common knowledge of whales at the time of the novel. Since Melville presents the study within a fictional context, voiced by a fictional character in the narrative, it is arguable whether or not Melville intended the classification as a serious scientific contribution. Moreover, Melville includes the larger members of the Cetaceans, as well as the porpoises (dolphins). It is quite possible that in the case of the Duodecimo whales (porpoises), Melville has unknowingly combined many disparate species into a single \\"chapter\\". Ishmael's classification The following is the classification introduced by Ishmael in Chapter XXXII, with the spellings and alternative names mentioned by Melville. He does not introduce the Latin scientific names, however, which are provided here as a cross-reference to the modern taxonomy. The Roman numerals shown here are those used by Ishmael for each \\"book\\" and \\"chapter\\". =I. The Folio Whale= These are the whales of the largest size. *I. Sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus), the most important prey of Nantucket whaling fleet, which operated principally in the Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean. The notorious fictional white whale Moby Dick in the novel is of this species, and is based on the real-life sperm whale Mocha Dick in the South Pacific in the 1840s. For dramatic effect, Melville asserts inaccurately that the sperm whale is the largest creature on Earth. While the blue whale was not well-observed at that time, the fin-back whale, the second largest whale species, was known to whalers and occasionally hunted. *II. Right whale (several species of the genus Eubalaena of the family Balaenidae), also known simply as the Whale, the Greenland Whale, the Black Whale, the Great Whale. Melville claims this whale was the first to be regularly hunted by human beings and is famously known for providing baleen, which was also known as \\"whalebone\\" at the time. The oil of this whale was commercially known as \\"whale oil\\" and was of inferior grade to that of the sperm whale. During the middle 19th century, it was the principal prey of the whaling fleets of the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, which operated largely in the North Atlantic and Arctic Ocean. *III. Fin-back whale (Balaenoptera physalus), also called the Tall-Spout and Long-John. According to Melville, the whale had been seen in almost every part of the oceans and was commonly observed by passengers crossing the Atlantic Ocean between Europe and New York City. *IV. Hump-back whale (Megaptera novaeangliae). Melville states that this species is seen frequently on the northern coast of the United States, where it is frequently captured and towed back to harbor. He compares the distinctive hump on its back to the pack of a peddler. Its oil is not very valuable. \\"He is the most gamesome of species and light-hearted of all the whales, making more gay foam and white water generally than any of other of them\\". *V. Razor-back whale (probably Balaenoptera physalus, identical to the fin-back). The name \\"Razorback whale\\" is now used as a synonym for the finback. Melville includes the razorback as a separate \\"chapter\\", but states (in the voice of Ishmael) that he has only observed him at a distance off Cape Horn. He knows little about this species, \\"nor does anyone else\\". *VI. Sulphur-bottom whale (Balaenoptera musculus, commonly known today as the blue whale). This species was elusive in Melville's day and he states he has observed it only from a distance in the southern seas. Knowledge of the whale among the Nantucket whaling fleet is sparse. He thus provides an incomplete description, mentioning the prominent feature of its \\"brimstone belly\\". According to Melville, the whale is never chased, since \\"he would run away with rope-walks of line\\". =II. The Octavo Whale= These are the whales of middle size. *I. Grampus (Orcinus orca commonly known as the orca or killer whale). Melville states that this species is known for its loud blowing and is well known among whalemen. According to Melville, it swims in herds and is never regularly hunted, although it has considerable oil that is good for producing light. He states that the appearance of the grampus is often taken by whalemen to presage the appearance of the sperm whale. *II. Black Fish whale (one or both species of the genus Globicephala, known today as the Pilot whale). Melville calls him the Hyena whale, based on its appearance, stating \\"the inner angles of his lips are curved upwards, he carries an everlasting Mephistophelian grin on his face\\". He states that the whale is found in all latitudes, and has a peculiar fin which appears similar to a Roman nose. The whale is often hunted by Nantucket whalers when sperm whales are not available, primarily to keep up the ship's own supply of oil. Although it has thin blubber, a single whale can yield up to thirty gallons of oil. *III. Narwhal or Nostril whale (Monodon monoceros). Melville writes at length about this whale, which at the time was a well-known denizen of the polar seas. He describes the horn of the narwhal and speculates on its purpose. According to Melville, it is also known as the tusked whale, horned whale and the unicorn whale. In ancient days the horn was used as an antidote for poison. He recounts that Martin Frobisher presented a narwhal horn to Elizabeth I upon returning from the Canadian Arctic. The oil of the narwhal is \\"very superior, clear and fine; but there is little of it, and he is seldom hunted\\". *IV. Killer whale (probably the orca). Melville states that the whale is little known both by the Nantucket whaling community and by naturalists. Ishmael claims to have seen him from a distance, stating that it is approximately the size of the grampus. It is known to seize the large whales by the lip, hanging there \\"like a leech, till the mighty brute is worried to death\\". It is never hunted and the type of oil it contains is unknown to the narrator. Ishmael somewhat dislikes the name, stating that \\"we are all killers, on land and on sea; Bonapartes and sharks included\\". *V. Thrasher whale (probably the orca, mistaken as a separate species in the North Atlantic). Melville states that little is known of the whale, but it has been observed to mount the Folio whale's back as it swims, working its way upwards by flogging the larger whale with its tail. =III. The Duodecimo Whale= These are the species of the smallest size, which Melville generically calls porpoises. *I. Huzza porpoise (Bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops spps.). The identification arises from Melville's statement that this is the \\"common porpoise found all over the globe\\". Melville's name is completely invented here, based on the fact that the \\"he always swims in hilarious shoals... their appearance is generally hailed with delight by the mariner... They are accounted a lucky omen\\". He states that a well-fed specimen will yield one gallon of good oil, but that the \\"fine and delicate fluid extracted from his jaws is exceedingly valuable\\" and is used by jewelers and watchmakers. The meat from this porpoise is also said to be \\"good eating\\". *II. Algerine porpoise. Melville states that this species is found only in the Pacific Ocean and is slightly larger than the \\"Huzza porpoise\\". Ishmael states that the species is ferocious when attacked, and that although he has lowered for this species many times, he has yet to see this species captured. It is unclear what species Melville meant here. Possibly a pygmy killer whale or the false killer whale. *III. Mealy-mouthed porpoise (Lissodelphis peronii, the southern right whale dolphin). Melville also calls this the right-whale porpoise, since it is often found in the vicinity of the right whale. According to Melville, it is found only in the Pacific Ocean. Beyond the Duodecimo Melville also lists \\"a rabble of uncertain, fugitive half-fabulous whales\\" of which he knew only by name and not experience. These were the Bottlenose Whale, Junk Whale, Pudding-Headed Whale, Cape Whale, Leading Whale, Cannon Whale, Scragg Whale, Coppered Whale, Elephant Whale, Iceberg Whale, Quog Whale, and Blue Whale. Their lack of description makes it difficult to know exactly which taxonomically correct whales these names might refer to, if any. He notes that should any of them be caught and classified they could be easily incorporated into his system.

Wodehouse, and features the young gentleman Bertie Wooster and his valet Jeeves. The story was published in The Strand Magazine in December 1921 in London, and in Cosmopolitan in New York that same month. The story was also included in the 1923 collection The Inimitable Jeeves as two separate chapters, \\"Jeeves Exerts the Old Cerebellum\\" and \\"No Wedding Bells for Bingo\\".Cawthorne (2013), p. 57. In the story, Bertie's friend Bingo Little wants to marry a waitress, and asks for help from Bertie and Jeeves to get his uncle to approve of her. Jeeves suggests a plan involving romance novels.  Plot  = Jeeves Exerts the Old Cerebellum = Bertie is appalled by his friend Bingo Little's new crimson tie, which is decorated with horseshoes. Bingo received it from a waitress named Mabel. It is springtime, and Bingo, who always falls in love in the spring, is in love with Mabel. He met her at a charity subscription (i.e., pay-to-attend) dance, where Bingo also happened to see Bertie's valet Jeeves. Bingo depends on his uncle Mr. Mortimer Little for an allowance, and fears Mr. Little will not approve of Bingo marrying a waitress. To get married, Bingo needs his uncle's approval and also an increase in his allowance. Bingo asks Bertie to pose the problem to Jeeves, who often helps Bertie's pals. When Bertie asks Jeeves for advice, Jeeves agrees to help. He already knows about Mr. Mortimer Little because he is engaged to Mr. Little's cook, Miss Watson. This news surprises Bertie. Knowing that the elder Mr. Little is bedridden with gout, Jeeves suggests that Bingo take the opportunity to read to him. Particularly, Jeeves suggests books by the romance novelist Rosie M. Banks, which portray inter-class marriage as not only possible but noble. Bertie approves the scheme and asks Jeeves to fetch the books for Bingo. = No Wedding Bells for Bingo = Bingo's uncle is deeply moved by the books, and Bertie is confident that Jeeves's plan will succeed. Later, Bingo tells Bertie that his uncle, who has recovered from his gout, wants to have lunch with Bertie. Bingo asks Bertie to tell his uncle that Bingo wants to marry a waitress, which Bingo does not have the nerve to do himself. Though reluctant, Bertie agrees. He has lunch with Mr. Little, who extols Bertie's accomplishments. This confuses Bertie, who has not done much. Bingo telephones to tell Bertie that, to increase Bertie's influence, Bingo told his uncle that Bertie is the author Rosie M. Banks. Bertie maintains the ruse, albeit unhappily. Bertie tells Mr. Little that Bingo wants to marry a waitress, and Mr. Little, moved by the books, approves. When Bertie asks him to raise Bingo's allowance, however, Mr. Little refuses, saying it would not be fair to the woman he soon intends to marry, his cook, Miss Watson. Bertie is sorry to have to tell Jeeves that the woman he was engaged to, Miss Watson, has chosen someone else. Yet Jeeves admits he had wanted to end the engagement anyway. In fact, he has another engagement of sorts with another girl, Mabel, the waitress whom Bingo had wanted to marry. Background References to international conflicts are rare in Wodehouse's stories, though a subtle reference appears in this story; Bertie asks Jeeves if there is any news in the papers, to which Jeeves replies, \\"Some slight friction threatening in the Balkans, sir. Otherwise, nothing.\\" This references the First World War and acknowledges the nonchalance generally exhibited by Edwardian England towards the gathering European crisis before the war broke out. Wodehouse was similarly disengaged in the face of war; according to Wodehouse scholar Robert McCrum, Wodehouse \\"carried on writing about an imaginary world that seemed far more vivid to him than the reality of his own times\\". Publication history 1921 Cosmopolitan illustration by T. D. Skidmore The story was illustrated by A. Wallis Mills in The Strand Magazine, and by T. D. Skidmore in Cosmopolitan.McIlvaine (1990), p. 184, D133.83. Separated into two parts, the story was included in the 1932 collection Nothing But Wodehouse.McIlvaine (1990), pp. 113-114, B2a. Along with the other short stories in the collections The Inimitable Jeeves, Carry On, Jeeves, and Very Good, Jeeves, \\"Jeeves in the Springtime\\" was included in the Jeeves Omnibus, published 30 October 1931 by Herbert Jenkins Ltd. The story was featured again in the second edition of the collection, which was published July 1967 and retitled The World of Jeeves. The second edition included two Jeeves short stories written after the first edition was published.McIlvaine (1990), pp. 112-113, B1. The story was collected in the 1935 anthology The Big Book of Great Short Stories, published by Odhams Press, and in the 1982 anthology Present Laughter, A Personal Anthology of Modern Humour, published by Robson Books.McIlvaine (1990), p. 194, E33, and p. 198, E121-123.  Adaptations  =Television= The story was adapted for an episode of The World of Wooster. Though titled \\"Jeeves Exerts the Old Cerebellum\\", the episode was based on the full short story. It was the fourth episode of the second series and was originally broadcast in the UK on 25 January 1966. This story was adapted in the Jeeves and Wooster episode \\"Wooster with a Wife\\", the sixth and final episode of the second series, which first aired in the UK on 19 May 1991. There are minor differences in plot, including: * In the episode, Jeeves is strongly affected by the sight of Bingo wearing a tie with horseshoes, though Jeeves never sees the tie in the original story. * Bingo's uncle is already Lord Bittlesham at the beginning of the episode, though he did not yet have this title in the original story. * In the episode, Bingo's uncle is never bedridden with gout. * There is no mention of a subscription dance in the episode. * Instead of only Bertie and Bingo's uncle eating lunch together, in the episode they are joined by Bingo and Bingo's young cousin Margaret, who was not in the original story. =Radio= This story, along with the rest of The Inimitable Jeeves, was adapted into a radio drama in 1973 as part of the series What Ho! Jeeves starring Michael Hordern as Jeeves and Richard Briers as Bertie Wooster.

Biography Flynn was born on 1 August 1979 in Nenagh, County Tipperary, Ireland. Her parents Andy and Mary Flynn formerly owned \\"Andy Flynn's\\", a pub/bed & breakfast in her home town of Nenagh and subsequently became the proprietors of Flynn's Bistro located in Pearse Street in Nenagh. Bernadette has an older brother (Andrew), an older sister (Elaine) and twin sisters Catriona and Maria. Her family has always been very supportive of her dancing. At the age of four she started at the Browne Academy of Dance, studying under Dorian Browne. Additionally, her sister Elaine tutored her in Irish dance in the early years, with classes during the week and dance competitions on the weekends. Her competitive achievements include six World titles, seven All-Ireland titles and nine Munster titles. Bernadette attended St. Mary Secondary school in Ireland. She won the 1996 World Irish dancing championship shortly before going to rehearsals for the 1996 opening of Michael Flatley's Lord of the Dance in Dublin. She has no regrets about leaving her school behind, saying, \\"This is what I've always wanted to do, it's a dream come true for any Irish dancer\\". Lord of the Dance When Flynn auditioned for Lord of the Dance, she was chosen to dance the lead role of Saoirse the Irish Colleen while Gillian Norris was chosen to dance the lead role of Morrighann the Temptress. Flynn is the original Saoirse and appears on both the original Lord of the Dance DVD as well as the Feet of Flames DVD. Of her role, she has said: > \\"I had no idea I would get a lead role. Gillian and I just went along to the > auditions just hoping to get in. We both went into Lord of the Dance as > backline dancers. We'd only seen Michael Flatley in Riverdance and when we > had to meet, it was like 'Michael Flatley, oh my god!' After the auditions > we went to the rehearsals and were just learning the dances and steps. At > this stage, we hadn't been given a storyline. It was very, very difficult to > get used to using our hands as well. One day we all had to dance using our > hands, and Gillian and I began to stand out.

It was all unsaid for a while, but then we were told we were > to take the lead roles in the Point in Dublin. We were told it could last a > day, a week, a month or maybe even years!\\" Michael Flatley has said of Flynn: \\"Dancing with Bernadette is like dancing with the air, you don't have to look and see where she is. You can feel her no matter where she is on the stage.\\" Her husband Damien O'Kane is also a member of the Lord of the Dance troupe and has been so since the beginning in 1996. He is one of the male leads and plays the Lord of the Dance. They were engaged in July 2003 and married on 28 December 2005. They have a daughter together named Mia Rose O'Kane. Career Flynn prefers show dancing to competition, because she loves the freedom she has while performing. She has broken a bone in her foot, as well as having a couple of ligament sprains. Highlights of her career include dancing at the Academy Awards in Los Angeles and for the President of Ireland during a visit to Nenagh. She can also be seen in two Olive Hurley Dance instructional videos: Irish dancing Step by Step and The 25th Anniversary World Championship. In January 2009, both Bernadette and Damien represented Ireland on the NBC hit reality TV show 'Superstars of Dance'.

Because the 6.5√ó50mmSR Arisaka cartridge it fired was considered underpowered, a replacement was devised, the Type 99 rifle, but both rifles saw usage until the end of the war. History and development The Imperial Japanese Army introduced the Type 30 rifle in 1897. However, the weapon had numerous shortcomings, which were highlighted by combat experience in the early stages of the Russo-Japanese War. These included bursting cartridges, a poorly designed lock in which excess gunpowder tended to accumulate, burning the face of the shooter, frequent misfires, jamming, difficulty in cleaning, and cartridge extraction. Major Kijiro Nambu undertook a redesign of the Type 30, which was introduced in 1906. Nambu reduced the number of parts making up the Type 30's bolt from nine to six and at that same time simplified manufacture and disassembly of the bolt without the need for tools.Allan and Macy. p.4-5 A dust cover was added because of experiences in the Russo-Japanese War that left rifles inoperable from dust.Honeycutt and Anthony p. 38 The weapon was produced in several locations: *Tokyo Arsenal from 1906 to 1932; 2,029,000 units (est.)Allan and Macy. p.478 *Kokura arsenal from 1933 to 1941: 494,700 units (est.) *Nagoya arsenal from 1932 to 1942: 312,500 units (est.) *Jinsen (in what is now Incheon) arsenal from 1942 to 1942: 13,400 units (est.) *Hoten (was called Mukden Arsenal before the Japanese took it over.Allan and Macy. p.30 In what is now Shenyang) arsenal from 1937 to 1944: 148,800 units (est.) By 1940 more than three million Type 38s had been issued to the Imperial Japanese Army. However, a concern that the 6.5√ó50mmSR Arisaka cartridge did not compare favorable to the ammunition used by the other great powers in the war led to the introduction of a further generation of rifles in 1939, during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Designated the Type 99 rifle, this new rifle used the more powerful 7.7√ó58mm Arisaka cartridge already in use with the Type 92 heavy machine gun and the Type 97 light machine gun. However, not all units received the new weapon, and the mixture of types with incompatible cartridges led to considerable logistics issues during World War II.  Description and variant types  The Type 38 rifle used the 6.5√ó50mm Arisaka cartridge. This cartridge produces little recoil when fired. However, while on par with the Norwegian and Italian 6.5mm military cartridges of the time, the 6.5√ó50mm was not as powerful as several others in use by other nations. The Type 38 at was the longest rifle of the war, due to the emphasis on bayonet training for the Japanese soldier of the era, whose average height was .\\"Battle of the Pacific: How Japs Fight\\". Time magazine, February 15, 1943. Accessed June 24, 2009. The rifle was even longer when the Type 30 bayonet was fixed. The Type 38 was fairly heavy, at about 4.25 kg. Post-war inspection of the Type 38 by the U.S. military and the National Rifle Association found that the Type 38's receiver was the strongest bolt action of any nation'sHatcher, p. 206, 210 and capable of handling more powerful cartridges. Nomenclature note: In the West, Japanese equipment is commonly referred to as \\"Type XX\\", rather than \\"Model XX\\". In the case of a firearm, \\"Model\\" is a more accurate interpretation of the SHIKI (Âºè) character, but the word \\"Type\\" has become well-established by collectors for decades. =Type 38 carbine= Intended for use by cavalry, engineers, quartermasters and other non-frontline troops, the Type 38 carbine was introduced into service at the same time as the standard Type 38. Its barrel was , overall length , and weight . The rifle lacked a bayonet. It was produced in a number of locations: *Tokyo Arsenal from 1906 to 1931; 210,000 units (est.)Allan and Macy. p.479 *Kokura arsenal from 1938 to 1941: 49,500 units (est.) *Nagoya arsenal from 1935 to 1942: 206,000 units (est.) *Hoten/Mukden arsenal from 1938 to 1944: 52,300 units (est.) =Type 44 carbine = Similar to the Type 38 carbine from the middle band back. The cavalry carbine is almost entirely different from the middle band forward with an under-folding bayonet, metal nosecap, stacking hook to the left side of the nosecap and wide front sight guards. This model was introduced in 1911. There are three variations of this rifle. Each variation based entirely on the nosecap size and the spacing of the nosecap screws. They have a unique storage compartment in the buttstock for a cleaning rod. = Type 97 sniper rifle= As with the standard Type 38, but with a rifle scope with 2.5x magnification, introduced in 1937. The scope was offset to allow loading by stripper clip and bolt handle slightly bent down. Some 14,000 were produced. =Type 38 short rifle= In the late 1930s to the early 1940s, an unknown number of Type 38 rifles were converted into short rifles at Nagoya Arsenal, that did all rebuilds of Type 38 and Type 44 rifles and carbines.Allan and Macy. p.234-235 The barrels were shortened to from the standard barrel and the stock shortened to match the barrel while the handguard retained its original length.Allan and Macy. p.234 The end result is a Type 38 which is similar in size to the Arisaka Type 99 short rifle. There is no consistency to serial numbers or arsenal marks as the rifles were converted from existing stock. Although total production is unknown, it is estimated that approximately 100,000 were converted.Allan and Macy. p.235 = Chinese Six/Five infantry rifle = Chinese copy of the Japanese Type 38 at the Taiyuan Arsenal in the very late 1920s to early 1930s for the warlord of Shansi province, General Yen Hsi-shan.

Estimated to have been 108,000 made.Allan and Macy. p.387-392 = Type 918 rifle = These copies of the Type 38 rifles are believed to have been manufactured at the South Manchuria Army Arsenal (also known as the 918 Arsenal), but very little is known about them. Chinese sources state that these rifles were made in China for Japan, but for whom it is not known. It does not bear the Japanese Imperial Chrysanthemum, but instead has a heart symbol and under it written \\"918 Type\\" (‰πù‰∏ÄÂÖ´Âºè). It is also not known if these were made before or right after the surrender of Japanese forces. It has an under-folding bayonet similar to the Japanese Type 44. The 918 stamped on top of the receivers stands for the date of September 18, 1931; the date of the Mukden Incident.Allan and Macy. p.398-401 = North China Type 19 carbine = A relatively crude copy of the Type 38 carbine that is believed to have been made mostly in the Chinese city of Tientsin and may have been intended for puppet troops. Unlike the other Type 19 that is a copy of the Type 30 carbine, but in 7.92√ó57mm Mauser, this Type 19 is chambered in the Japanese 6.5x50sr cartridge. Like the other Type 19, it also has a cherry blossom on the receiver and not the Japanese Imperial Chrysanthemum and also says \\"North China Type 19\\" (ÂåóÊîØ‰∏Ä‰πùÂºè). The 19 may mean the 19th year of Showa Era or 1944. The true military designation is unknown. Approximately 40,000 carbines are thought to have been produced.Allan and Macy. p.401-405 = Siamese Type 66 long rifle = Siam (Thailand) ordered 50,000 Type 38 rifles in 1924 from the Tokyo Army Arsenal chambered in their Type 66 8x52r cartridge. The receiver is marked with the Siamese Charkra with \\"Type 66\\" (‡πÅ‡∏ö‡∏ö ‡πñ‡πñ) written under it. Not only was the caliber changed, but the sights, bayonet and cleaning rod are different than the Japanese version. Almost all parts, including screws cannot be interchanged with the Japanese Type 38.Allan and Macy. p.421-427 = Thai Type 83 rifle = Unlike the Siamese Type 66 (‡πÅ‡∏ö‡∏ö ‡πñ‡πñ), this rifle is a standard Japanese Type 38 in 6.5x50sr that was sent as aid from Japan to Thailand in 1940. These were taken straight from assembly lines at Nagoya and Kokura arsenals, after the Japanese Imperial Chrysanthemum was canceled out by zeros along the petals. In Thailand they called it the Type 83 (‡πÅ‡∏ö‡∏ö ‡πò‡πì). These rifles were issued to second-line troops to free up rifles in their main caliber from front line duties for the Franco-Thai War.Allan and Macy. p.430 Later in the 1950s, some of these rifles had their barrels and stocks cut down to short rifle length with many of those being rechambered for .30-06 Type 88 cartridge and becoming Type Type 83/88s (‡πÅ‡∏ö‡∏ö ‡πò‡πì/‡πò‡πò).Allan and Macy. p.431-432 Very few of these rifles were imported into the United States because of the Gun Control Act of 1968 restricting former military arms from entering the country.Allan and Macy. p.432-433 = Thai Type 91 police carbine = Made after World War II, these carbines were made in Thailand at the Royal Thai Arsenals in Bangkok from Type 38 parts for a handy carbine for police. The stock and barrel was cut down. The stocks were cut out like a M1 carbine stock and used M1 carbine slings and oilers. Some bolts were turned down, some not. Some had the Royal Thai Police symbol stamped on the receiver with \\"91\\" (‡πô‡πë) stamped above it and some received the Siamese Charkra stamped on the receiver. They all retained their original Japanese caliber of 6.5x50sr.Allan and Macy. p.434-440 = Mexican Model 1913 rifle and carbine= Ordered in mid 1913 from the Huerta government in the standard Mexican military caliber, 7√ó57mm Mauser, for 50,000 rifles and later for another 25,000 carbines from the Tokyo Artillery Arsenal. They were made to fit the Mexican Mauser model 1895, 1902 or 1910 bayonets. In early 1914 the first 10,000-15,000 rifles arrived in Mexico, but the Japanese suspended, probably because Huerta had fled the country in mid-1914 and feared they would not be paid for the rest. In late 1914 or early 1915 Imperial Russia, desperate for arms, bought the remainder left in Japan which was either 35,400 or 60,000 rifles and carbines. The first few thousand rifles had three interlocking circles on the receiver, the rest had the Mexican crest under \\"Republica Mexicana\\".Allan and Macy. p.447-451 =Estonian KL .303= Estonian conversion of standard Type 38 to .303 British cartridge, intended for usage by second line troops of the Estonian Defence League. Total 24,000 rifles were rebored during 1929-1934. =7.62x39 conversion= After World War II, a lot of Type 38s were converted for use by China by switching to the 7.62x39 caliber since they were being equipped with AK and SKS rifles.https://www.forgottenweapons.com/rifles/arisakas-in-7-62x39mm/ Two versions of the converted Type 38s consisted of rifles with just a SKS barrel.

It fired the 6.5√ó50mm Arisaka round, and capacity was an internal five-round box magazine, it was fed via five-round chargers. The Type 44 was briefly used to experiment on using the 7.7√ó58mm Arisaka before it was dropped due to problems regarding recoil.http://www.smallarmsreview.com/display.article.cfm?idarticles=2809 =Variants= The Type 44 was produced in three variations (referred to as First, Second, and Third variations). The major differences between variations was in the folding bayonet housing, which increased the length and durability with each variation. The changes to the bayonet housing was because of accuracy issues and to strengthen the stock. A minor difference between variations may be found in the cleaning rod compartment found beneath the buttplate. First variation stocks had two holes drilled for each half of the cleaning rod, while second and third variations had a single larger hole to house both halves of the cleaning rod.

Bendahara (Jawi: ÿ®ŸÜÿØÿßŸáÿßÿ±ÿß) is an administrative position within classical Malay kingdoms comparable to a vizier before the intervention of European powers during the 19th century. A bendahara was appointed by a sultan and was a hereditary post. The bendahara and the sultan shared the same lineage. Tasks of the Bendahara The closest post which is comparable to the post of the vizier as the Malay kingdoms are Islamic kingdoms. As the bendahara is the head of the nobility, the status confers certain responsibility. The bendahara is the backbone of the Malay Sultanate. For the ancient kingdoms of Malacca and Johor, there were many tasks and responsibilities but the primary ones were: * coronation and installation of the Sultan * responsibility of the welfare of the Sultan * adviser to his majesty on affairs of the state based on Sharia and Adat (Prevailing norms and values) * responsibility of the Royal marriage, birth and funeral * responsibility of the royal succession if the Sultan dies without an heir * acting as a vicegerent if the Sultan is still young * acting on any command of the Sultan. Legitimacy of the Sultan lies with the bendahara. The bendahara always consulted the other nobles before arriving at a decision. The bendahara and nobles do this for the well-being of the subjects and is essential if there are problems in the state. These tasks are more extensive than any vizier or the modern prime minister. The involvement of the British and the Dutch in the administration of the Malay States and the subsequent independence of Malaysia and Indonesia has reduced the Bendahara to a symbolic title only. History Though it is unclear when the title was first used, the Sultanate of Malacca had several influential bendaharas. The most famous is Tun Perak. Under Tun Perak's service which spanned several sultans, Malacca reached its height in the late 15th century. According to the Malay Annals and the Hikayat Hang Tuah, the bendahara secretly saved the life of Hang Tuah, a laksamana the sultan had ordered killed. In 1612, Bendahara Tun Sri Lanang of the Sultanate of Johor was commissioned by Sultan Alauddin Riaayat Shah of Johor to compile Malay history and record it into a book. The book was known as Sulalatus Salatin and later known as Sejarah Melayu, an important literary piece in Malay language history. In 1699, Bendahara Abdul Jalil became Sultan Abdul Jalil IV of Johor after the previous sultan, Mahmud Shah II was murdered, leaving no heir behind. After the rule of Sultan Abdul Jalil IV, the bendahara was awarded Pahang as his personal fief. Bendahara Tun Abbas and his descendants ruled Pahang continuously until Tun Mutahir, who was deposed in a civil war in 1863. The current Terengganu sultanate was founded by Sultan Zainal Abidin I of Terengganu in 1708. He was the son of Tun Habib Abdul Majid, a 17th-century bendahara of Johor.

Thereafter the Bendahara of Johor were known as the Bendahara in Pahang. They are also known as \\"Raja Bendahara\\" for their status as the rulers of Pahang as a vassal state of the Johore Sultanate. =Bendahara in Pahang= *Tun Abdul Majid, Raja Bendahara Pahang I (1777‚Äì1802) *Tun Muhammad, Raja Bendahara Pahang II *Tun Koris, Bendahara Paduka Raja, Raja Bendahara Pahang III (1803‚Äì1806) *Tun Ali, Bendahara Siwa Raja, Raja Bendahara Pahang IV (1806‚Äì1847) *Tun Mutahir, Bendahara Seri Maharaja, Raja Bendahara Pahang V (1847‚Äì1863). He was the last reigning Raja Bendahara of Pahang. He was ousted by his brother Wan Ahmad, who was later proclaimed as Sultan of Pahang after the dismemberment of the Johore Empire. Modern-day usage In modern times of Malaysia, it is typical to render the position as prime minister. Though a bendahara's duties are similar to that of a prime minister's, the two terms are not interchangeable. One clear difference is the amount of power held by the two positions. In ancient times, the bendahara was typically the highest-ranking official after the sultan but the sultan retained ultimate authority. The sultan was not answerable to the bendahara, or to anyone else for that matter. The sultan was not just a constitutional monarchy like the Yang di-Pertuan Agong in contemporary Malaysia where the Prime Minister holds effective political power.

Its rear bed has a vertically moveable hopper with a sharp horizontal front edge that cuts into the soil like a carpenter's plane and fills the hopper. When full the hopper is raised, closed, and the scraper transports its load to the fill area for dumping. In an 'elevating scraper' a conveyor belt moves material from the cutting edge into the hopper.  Design  The scraper is a large piece of equipment which is used in mining, construction, agriculture and other earthmoving applications. The rear part has a vertically moveable hopper (also known as the bowl) with a sharp horizontal front edge. The hopper can be hydraulically lowered and raised. When the hopper is lowered, the front edge cuts into the soil or clay like a plane and fills the hopper. When the hopper is full ( heaped, depending on type) it is raised, and closed with a vertical blade (known as the apron). The scraper can transport its load to the fill area where the blade is raised, the back panel of the hopper, or the ejector, is hydraulically pushed forward and the load tumbles out. Then the empty scraper returns to the cut site and repeats the cycle. Caterpillar 613C elevating scraper On the 'elevating scraper' the bowl is filled by a type of conveyor arrangement fitted with a horizontal flights to move the material engaged by the cutting edge into the bowl as the machine moves forward. Elevating scrapers do not require assistance from push-tractors. The pioneer developer of the elevating scraper was Hancock Manufacturing Company of Lubbock, Texas USA. Self-propelled scrapers were invented by R. G. LeTourneau in the 1930s.LeTourneau earthmovers, Eric C. Orlemann, MBI, His company called them Tournahoppers. This concept was further developed by LeTourneau Westinghouse Company.The Wabco Archive Wheel-Tractor Scrapers (Global General Publishing Pty Ltd,2011) Most current scrapers have two axles, although historically tri-axle configurations were dominant. Scrapers can be very efficient on short hauls where the cut and fill areas are close together and have sufficient length to fill the hopper. The heavier scraper types have two engines (\\"tandem powered\\"), one driving the front wheels, one driving the rear wheels, with engines up to . Multiple scrapers can work together in a push-pull fashion but this requires a long cut area.  Configurations  A Caterpillar towed scraper parked up * Open bowl: usually requires a push-cat (bulldozer or similar) to assist in loading. * Elevating scraper: self-loading as it uses an elevator to load material; requires no push-cat. * Tandem scrapers: separate tractor and scraper engines provide greater power, and better traction in steep or slippery areas * Tandem Push-Pull: concentrates the combined horsepower of two such machines onto one cutting edge. The push-pull attachment allows two individual scrapers to act as a self-loading system, typically loading both machines in less than a minute, one after the other. * Auger: uses vertically mounted auger in the bowl to pull material upwards. * Pull type scraper: uses agricultural tractor, articulated dump truck, or bulldozer to pull. Pull type scrapers can be utilized individually or two or three units can be pulled behind a single tractor.

Scrapers are typically formed by chipping the end of a flake of stone in order to create one sharp side and to keep the rest of the sides dull to facilitate grasping it. Most scrapers are either circle or blade-like in shape. The working edges of scrapers tend to be convex, and many have trimmed and dulled lateral edges to facilitate hafting. One important variety of scraper is the thumbnail scraper, a scraper shaped much like its namesake. This scraper type is common at Paleo-Indian sites in North America. Scrapers are one of the most varied lithic tools found at archaeological sites. Due to the vast array of scrapers there are many typologies that scrapers can fall under, including tool size, tool shape, tool base, the number of working edges, edge angle, edge shape, and many more. Method of use The edge of the scraper that is extremely angled is the working edge. This edge is often used to soften hides or to clean meat off of the hides, in addition to being used for wood work. As the term scraper suggests, this tool was scraped at the hide or wood in order to reach the end goal. Scrapers were also made in order to skin animals. Scrapers tended to be large enough to fit comfortably in the hand and could be used without being mounted on wood or bone. However, it is very likely that scrapers were mounted on short handles even though it is very rare to find mounted scrapers. As scrapers are used they have to be resharpened in order to stay effective. This causes them to get progressively smaller as they are used, resharpened, used, resharpened, and used again. Consequently, the majority of the scrapers that are found on sites are ones that have been resharpened and used to the point of being no longer functional. Categories The two main classifications of scrapers are either end scrapers or side scrapers. End scrapers have working edges on one or both ends of a blade or flake, whereas side scrapers have a working edge along one of the long sides. There are a couple of types of scrapers based on their specific use when it comes to wood and hide or based on the shape and design of the scraper itself. The grattoir is a type of scraper made usually made of flint and its main uses were to work wood and to clean hides. This type of scraper has its working edge along the long axis of the blade. The nose scraper typically has a smaller working edge either at both ends or just one end. This type of scraper is made from a convex blade and is used in more fine tuning work. The hollow scraper is a type of scraper that has a notch worked into the side or end of the scraper. Typologies Convex transverse scraper Tool size: This can be determined by either weight or dimensions and typically divided into either large or small scrapers. Tool shape: There are many different shapes scrapers can be, including rectangular, triangular, irregular, discoidal, domed, or keeled. In many cases it can be hard to determine the classification for the shape of the scraper. The shape of the scraper is often considered diagnostic. Shaping vs. Use Damage: Scrapers are often divided between ones that have been purposefully shaped for a specific use and ones that have been shaped due to their use. Tool base: Scrapers are classified based on if they originated from a blade or a flake. Number of working edges: Some scrapers have only one working edge while other scrapers have 2 working edges. It is extremely uncommon for there to be a scraper with three working edges. Edge angle: Some scrapers have vertical working edges while other scrapers have acute working edges. Edge shape: There is distinction between concave, straight, and convex working edges on scrapers. Location of functional edges: One of the main distinctions in scrapers, depends on if the working edge is on the end or the side of the scraper.

Following the standard practice of the time, it was adapted from an existing infantry rifle. The only difference between this rifle and the original Type 38 is that it had a lightened stock, a 2.5 power telescopic sight and a mid-band setup for a monopod, although later models had this deleted. The rifle entered service in 1937. When fired, the mild 6.5x50mm Arisaka cartridge gave off little flash or smoke and made counter-sniper activity difficult. The lack of flash and smoke comes from the length of the barrel; a long barrel allows cartridge propellant to fully burn and attain the optimum combination of accuracy and bullet velocity. The scope was offset to the left, to allow stripper clip loading. Like other Mauser pattern rifles, it has a five-round box magazine. The rifle can be loaded with either a 5-round stripper clip, or single rounds. The Type 97 was manufactured at the Nagoya Arsenal and Kokura Arsenal, with the bulk of them made in Nagoya.  Combat history  After fighting German-trained Chinese snipers, the Japanese Army decided to develop snipers for themselves. Training in camouflage, field craft and other such techniques was common to normal Japanese infantry, so snipers were specially trained only in shooting and given a sniper rifle. Type 97 was the standard Japanese sniper rifle, a regular Type 38 Arisaka fitted with a scope. The Type 97 was used frequently by Japanese snipers, often hidden in palm trees or more usually hidden positions, with deadly results. As they were chambered for the 6.5x50SR Japanese cartridge, which produced virtually no smoke or flash from the long barrel of the Type or Type 97, it was a difficult rifle to spot at ranges greater than 150 yards. Experienced US troops knew they had to continue their advance when fired on by Japanese snipers in order to get closer and spot the sniper.

In the lead-up to autonomy for Bougainville, Kabui opposed the introduction of political parties into the province, stating \\"the people of Bougainville regard political parties as divisive and given the hate, killings, ill- feelings and divisions that existed during the 10-year-old violent crisis on the island, the leaders of Bougainville do not want political parties to come in and divide the people once again\\". In February 2005, it was recognised as a \\"consultative and advisory body\\" to the Interim Bougainville Provincial Government ahead of the first elections later that year. Although Kabui had a stated dislike for political parties, the BPC was registered as a party for the inaugural 2005 election. Kabui ran for the new position of President of the Autonomous Region of Bougainville and won, while party members performed well in the Bougainville House of Representatives.

It was based on the American M1 Garand with an integral 10-round magazine and chambered for the Japanese 7.7√ó58mm Arisaka cartridge. Where the Garand used an en-bloc clip, the Type 4's integral magazine was charged with two 5-round stripper clips and the rifle also used Japanese-style tangent sights. The Type 4 had been developed alongside several other experimental semi-automatic rifles. However, none of the rifles entered into service before the end of World War II, with only 250 being made, and many others were never assembled. There were several problems with jamming and feed systems, which also delayed its testing. History During the Second World War, Japanese soldiers relied on bolt-action type rifles. However, guns were getting scarce and their main military opponent, the United States, had replaced their bolt weapons with modern semi-automatic rifles. At the same time, Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union were also developing their own semi-automatic weapons, such as the SVT-40 and Gewehr 43 which would give them great advantage on the battlefield. This pressured Japan to find a quick way to cope with their military disadvantage. Instead of designing and investing in a new weapon from scratch, they opted to copy the American M1 Garand. Initially, the Japanese experimented with re-chambering captured American M1 rifles, since the 7.7 Japanese cartridge is dimensionally similar to the .30-06. They found that while the Garand could chamber, fire, and cycle with the 7.7 ammunition, the en-bloc clip system was incompatible with the cartridge and would not feed reliably. Instead the Japanese designers reverse engineered the M1 and discarded the en-bloc clip, replacing it with a fixed internal 10 round magazine charged by two 5 round Arisaka Type 99 stripper clips.https://www.forgottenweapons.com/ria-japanese-type-4-garand-copy/ Japan had previously developed semi-automatic service rifles, but none of them had been viewed as successful or of trustworthy quality. The design work for the Type 4 began in 1944. The rifle was meant to be mass-produced in 1945. However, the Japanese defeat in the war in August halted its manufacturing. At the time, only 100 guns were completed out of the 250 in the workshop. Twenty of them were taken by the Allies at the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal on Honshu after the end of the war. Today, the Japanese Garand is a rarity. An example of this rifle can be found in the US National Firearms Museum, in the World War II section.

He played in Major League Baseball as a catcher for the Cleveland Indians (1921‚Äì1932, 1939), Washington Senators (1933‚Äì1934), Chicago White Sox (1935‚Äì1938) and the St. Louis Browns (1942). Sewell batted and threw right-handed. He was regarded as one of the best defensive catchers of his era. Baseball career Born in the rural town of Titus, Alabama, Sewell grew up wanting to play baseball, and graduated from the University of Alabama where, he played for the Alabama Crimson Tide baseball team as an infielder. He was linked to the Cleveland Indians because his brother Joe Sewell became their starting shortstop in 1920. When Indians scout Patsy Flaherty signed Sewell, he insisted that he play as a catcher. He began the 1921 season with the Columbus Senators in the American Association but, after only 17 minor league games, Sewell made his major league debut with the Cleveland Indians on June 30, 1921. Sewell served as a reserve catcher, working behind Steve O'Neill until the 1923 season when O'Neill was injured in an auto accident. Sewell then played in a platoon role alongside Glenn Myatt, in which the left-hand hitting Myatt played the team's home games at League Park due to its 290-foot distance to the right field fence, while Sewell played the team's road games. Sewell eventually took over as the Indians number one catcher in the 1926 season, due to his superior defensive skills. He finished the year with only a .238 batting average but, led the American League catchers with 91 assists. In 1927, Sewell had a breakout year, hitting for a career-high .294 batting average with 27 doubles, 53 runs batted in, and scored 52 runs. Sewell questioned Babe Ruth's integrity in a game on June 11, . He demanded that umpires check Ruth's bat after he clouted two straight home runs off Garland Buckeye. Although he led the league's catchers with 20 errors, he also led the league with 119 assists and 71 baserunners caught stealing. Despite the fact that the Indians finished the season in sixth place, Sewell ranked ninth in voting for the American League Most Valuable Player Award. In 1928, he once again led the league's catchers with 117 assists and 60 baserunners caught stealing and ranked twelfth in voting for the American League Most Valuable Player Award. In 1933, Sewell was traded to the Washington Senators for catcher Roy Spencer. He posted career-highs with 125 hits including 30 doubles along with 61 runs batted in as, the Senators under first-year player-manager Joe Cronin, won 99 games to clinch the American League pennant by nine games over the New York Yankees. During a September game against the Yankees, Sewell made an odd double play. Lou Gehrig and Dixie Walker were on base when, Tony Lazzeri hit a ball to deep right field. Gehrig hesitated as he waited to see if the ball might be caught, before heading towards home plate with Walker right behind him. Sewell received the throw from the outfield and tagged both runners out with one sweeping motion. Cronin credited Sewell as a major factor in helping the Senators' pitching staff. The Senators eventually lost to the New York Giants in the 1933 World Series. In what would be his only postseason appearance, Sewell posted a .176 batting average (3 for 17), with one stolen base, one run scored, and one run batted in during the five-game series. Sewell in 1934 Sewell began the 1934 season with a hand injury and didn't play his first game until June 13. Two weeks later, he was struck in the head and knocked unconscious by a pitch thrown by St. Louis Browns pitcher, Bump Hadley. Sewell ended the season with a .237 batting average. In January 1935, Sewell was traded to the St. Louis Browns, ironically for Bump Hadley. The Browns promptly traded him to the Chicago White Sox on the very same day. His offensive statistics improved with the White Sox, posting a .285 batting average with 67 runs batted in and, finished second among the league's catchers in assists and third in fielding percentage. In 1936, Sewell produced career-highs with 5 home runs and 73 runs batted in and, led American League catchers in assists and in baserunners caught stealing. By the first week of June 1937, Sewell had a .316 batting average to earn a spot as a reserve for the American League team in the 1937 All-Star Game. That year, he put up even better numbers than the consistently good ones he had been posting for a decade. On the season, he had a .269 batting average, with a .343 on-base percentage and six triples. Sewell finished the season ranked fifth in voting for the American League Most Valuable Player Award. Sewell's batting average dropped to .213 in 1938 and, in December of that year, he was purchased by the Brooklyn Dodgers for $7500. In April 1939, the 39-year-old Sewell was released by the Dodgers but, promptly signed a contract as a third-string catcher and pitching coach for the Cleveland Indians. The Indians hoped to groom him as an eventual replacement for manager Oscar Vitt who had fallen from the graces of General Manager Cy Slapnicka. He spent the 1940 season as a pitching coach but, when the Indians decided to hire Roger Peckinpaugh as their manager for the 1941 season, Sewell accepted the manager's position with the St. Louis Browns, replacing Fred Haney. Because of the shortage of major league players during the Second World War, Sewell served as a player-manager during the 1942 season, appearing in six games. He played his final game as a player on August 1, at the age of 41. Career statistics In a 20-year major league career, Sewell played in 1,630 games, accumulating 1,393 hits in 5,383 at bats for a .259 career batting average along with 20 home runs, 698 runs batted in and an on-base percentage of .323. He retired with a .978 fielding percentage. As a catcher, Sewell had a strong throwing arm, leading the American League four times in baserunners caught stealing and four times in assists. Even for the era, Sewell's low strikeout numbers were remarkable. He never struck out more than 27 times in a season, and his career best was just 16 strikeouts in 451 at-bats in . Sewell held the American League record of 20 seasons as an active catcher until Carlton Fisk surpassed the record with 24 seasons as an active catcher with the Boston Red Sox (1969, 1971‚Äì80) and the Chicago White Sox (1981‚Äì93). He caught three no-hitters in his career; Wes Ferrell in 1931, Vern Kennedy in 1935, and Bill Dietrich in 1938. In his book, The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract, baseball historian Bill James ranked Sewell as the fourth best catcher in the American League during his career. James ranked Mickey Cochrane, Bill Dickey and Rick Ferrell as the top three, all of whom were inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Sewell and his brother Joe, rank eighth on the all-time list of combined hits by brothers, with 3,619. Besides his brother, Joe Sewell, a Hall of Fame shortstop, he had another brother named Tommy Sewell, who had one at-bat with the Chicago Cubs. Managing career After retiring as an active player, Sewell continued to manage the St. Louis Browns. He led them to the American League pennant - the team's only championship in its 52 years in St. Louis, although they lost to the St. Louis Cardinals in the 1944 World Series. That year, he managed such players as Red Hayworth, Vern Stephens, and Jack Kramer, led them to an 89-65 record, and was awarded The Sporting News' Manager of the Year Award. After a seventh-place finish in 1946, Sewell stepped down as the Browns' manager. In January 1949 Sewell was hired as a pitching coach by the Cincinnati Reds and, in October of that year, he took over as the Reds' manager from Bucky Walters. After two unsuccessful seasons with the Reds, he resigned in July 1952 and was replaced by Rogers Hornsby. Sewell's major league managerial record was 606-644, a .485 winning percentage. In December , Sewell was hired as manager of the Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League. He led the team to the league championship in his first season and won the International League Manager of the Year Award. Sewell led the Maple Leafs to a second-place finish in 1955. The team had a .622 winning percentage over his two years as manager. In November , he was named as the manager for the Seattle Rainiers of the Pacific Coast League. In August , Sewell was fired after one season in part due to player discontent over his managerial style. Sewell died in Akron, Ohio in at the age of 86.

Known by the ancient Romans as Caere, and previously by the Etruscans as Caisra or Cisra, and as Agylla (or ŒÜŒ≥œÖŒªŒªŒ±) by the Greeks, its modern name derives from Caere Vetus used in the 13th century to distinguish it from Caere Novum (the current town). It is the site of the ancient Etruscan city which was one of the most important Etruscan cities with an area more than 15 times larger than today's town. Caere was one of the city-states of the Etruscan League and at its height, around 600 BC, its population was perhaps around 25,000 ‚Äì 40,000 people. Site The ancient city was situated about 7 km from the sea, a location which made it a wealthy trading town derived originally from the iron-ore mines in the Tolfa Hills.Karl-Wilhelm Weber: Geschichte der Etrusker, Berlin, K√∂ln, Mainz 1979, , S. 38 It had three sea ports including Pyrgi, connected to Caere by a road about 13 km long and 10 m wide, and Punicum. Pyrgi was also known for its sanctuary of monumental temples from 510 BC, built by the king of Caere and dedicated to the goddesses Leucothea and Ilithyia, of which several sculptures are exhibited at the Villa Giulia. History Monuments Via degli Inferi, the main entrance to the Banditaccia Necropolis. Interior of an Etruscan tomb in the Banditaccia necropolis. Sarcophagus of the Spouses (Villa Giulia) Sculpture from a temple at Caere, 525‚Äì500 BC (Altes Museum Berlin) Gold bracelet from the tomb Regolini-Galassi 650 BC Little is known of the ancient city, although six temples are known from various sources. Two of them have been excavated, one of Hera, the other in the north of the city. Parts of the city walls are still visible today and excavations opened up a theatre. Three necropolis were found. The contents of the tombs were excavated, often chaotically and illegally; over the last few centuries, they have yielded rich and exquisite objects, including ceramics and jewellery which today grace many of the world's museums. One famous and important work of art is the Sarcophagus of the Spouses. =Necropolis of the Banditaccia= The most famous attraction of Cerveteri is the Necropoli della Banditaccia, which has been declared by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site together with the necropolis in Tarquinia. It covers an area of , of which can be visited, encompassing a total of about 1,000 tombs often housed in characteristic mounds. It is the largest ancient necropolis in the Mediterranean area. The name Banditaccia comes from the leasing (bando) of areas of land to the Cerveteri population by the local landowners. The tombs date from the 9th century BC (Villanovan culture) to the later Etruscan period (third century BC). The earliest tombs are in the shape of a pit, in which the ashes of the dead were housed; also, simple potholes are present. The most important tombs include: *Tomb Regolini- Galassi with rich gold finds from the mid-7th century BC *Tomb of the capitals (Tomba dei Capitelli), middle 6th century BC *Tomb of the shields and chairs (Tomba degli Scudi e delle Sedie), middle 6th century BC *Tomb of the Painted Lions (Tomba dei Leoni dipinti), 620 BC *Tomb of the Reliefs (Tomba dei Rilievi), 4th ‚Äì 2nd century BC *Tomb of the Sea Waves (Tomba delle Onde Marine), 4th‚Äì3rd century BC *Tomb of the Alcove (Tomba dell'Alcova), 4th ‚Äì 3rd century BC *Tomba della capanna *Tomba dei Vasi Greci *Tomba dei Doli *Tomba calabresi From the later Etruscan period are two types of tombs: tumulus-type tombs and the so-called \\"dice\\", the latter being simple square tombs built in long rows along roads within the necropolis. The visitable area contains two such roads, the Via dei Monti Ceriti and the Via dei Monti della Tolfa (6th century BC). The tumuli are circular structures built in tuff, and the interiors, carved from the living rock, house a reconstruction of the house of the dead, including a corridor (dromos), a central hall, and several rooms. Modern knowledge of Etruscan daily life is largely dependent on the numerous decorative details and finds from such tombs. One of the most famous tombs is the Tomb of the Reliefs, identified from an inscription as belonging to the Matuna family and provided with an exceptional series of frescoes, bas-reliefs and sculptures portraying a large series of contemporary life tools. The most recent tombs date from the 3rd century BC. Some of them are marked by external cippi, which are cylindrical for men, and in the shape of a small house for women. A large number of finds excavated at Cerveteri are in the National Etruscan Museum, Rome, with others in the Vatican Museums and many other museums around the world. Others, mainly pottery, are in the Archaeological Museum at Cerveteri itself. =Other monuments= *The Rocca (castle) *Church of Santa Maria Maggiore, including a medieval section reachable from the 1950s addition through a triumphal arch. *Palazzo Ruspoli, rebuilt as baronial palace by the Orsini in 1533. The portico and the loggia on the fa√ßade are from the 17th century. It is connected to Santa Maria Maggiore through a passetto (enclosed bridge), built in 1760. *The small church of Sant'Antonio Abate, with a 1472 fresco by Lorenzo da Viterbo. *The medieval burgh of Ceri *Castle of Cerenova Cerveteri DOC Around the city of Cerveteri is an Italian DOC wine region that produces red and white blended wines. The red wines are blends of 60% Sangiovese and Montepulciano, 25% Cesanese and up to 30% of Canaiolo, Carignan and Barbera. The grapes are limited to a harvest yield of 15 tonnes/ha and the final wine must have a minimum alcohol level of 11%. The white wines are composed of a minimum blend of 50% Trebbiano Romagnolo and Giallo, a maximum of 35% Malvasia di Candia and a maximum of 15% Friulano, Verdicchio, Bellone and Bombino bianco.

It was developed at the Koishikawa Arsenal and is named for its year of adoption in the Japanese dating system (the 26th year of the reign of the Meiji emperor, i.e., 1893). The revolver saw action in conflicts including the Russo-Japanese War, World War I and World War II. It is an amalgamation of design features from other revolvers made during the time period. The revolver has a design flaw in that the cylinder freewheels when not engaged, so during movement (such as in combat) it may rotate to an already fired chamber. Five distinct phases of production have different markings depending on the time and individual Type 26 produced. The 9mm Japanese revolver ammunition used is unique to the weapon. The Type 26 has a double-action only mechanism and is therefore difficult to aim accurately. The Type 26 was replaced by the Nambu pistol in the first half of the 20th century. History Koishikawa Arsenal before the Great Kant≈ç earthquake Known as the Meiji 26 Nen Ken Ju (meaning \\"Pistol, Pattern of the 26th year of the Meiji era\\"),Hogg, Ian, Military Small Arms of the 20th Century, 7th Edition, (2000) p. 66 the Type 26 revolver was the first indigenous revolver adopted by the Japanese military.Skennerton, Ian, Japanese Service Pistols Handbook (2008) p. 7 The Type 26 was produced to replace the aging Smith & Wesson New Model No. 3Kinard, Jeff. Pistols: An Illustrated History of Their Impact (2003), p. 161 and was officially adopted March 29, 1894.Derby, Harry L. Japanese Military Cartridge Handguns 1893‚Äì1945 (2003), p. 15 The design is widely believed to be a mixture of features taken from other revolvers.Hogg, Ian, Pistols of the World, 4th Edition, (2004) p. 190 The lock design is similar to Galand designs, the hinged frame is similar to Smith & Wesson designs, and the hinged side plate covering the lock is similar to the Mod√®le 1892 revolver. The cartridge was loaded with black powder until 1900 when the cartridges began to be loaded with smokeless powder. The Type 26 is considered a remarkable leap in Japanese pistol development despite the international influence, with the matchlock being the most common domestic Japanese handgun 40 years earlier.Kinard, Jeff. Pistols: An Illustrated History of Their Impact (2003), p. 162 Production stopped after 1923 when much of the Koishikawa Arsenal was destroyed in the 1923 Great Kant≈ç earthquake, with assembly continuing until the exhaustion of stockpiled parts.Hogg, Ian, Pistols of the World, 4th Edition, (2004) p. 191 Approximately 59,000 Type 26 revolvers were produced and an additional 900 revolvers were made in pre-production. Restoration and re-issue of revolvers that had been removed from service because of damage or wear, was carried out on an as needed basis over a period of many years.Derby, Harry L. Japanese Military Cartridge Handguns 1893‚Äì1945 (2003), p. 20 The original Type 26s are missing the external markings of later produced revolvers and are identifiable by numbers stamped on internal parts. Type 26s were still being used in 1945 which, according to firearms expert and author Ian Hogg, is considered a testament to their original workmanship and a much more suitable combat weapon than later Japanese produced pistols. Design The Type 26 revolver is 231 mm (9.09 in) in length and 130 mm (5.12 in) tall, weighing 880 g (1 lb 15oz) unloaded. It has an octagonal barrel, with the foresight blade being embedded directly into the barrel. The rear sight is incorporated into the top of the frame.McNab, Chris, The Great Book of Guns (2004) p. 113 A hinged sideplate allows access to the mechanism for lubricating and servicing.Skennerton, Ian, Japanese Service Pistols Handbook (2008) p. 20 The weapon was opened by lifting the top latch, after which the barrel was swung downward, activating the automatic ejector. The notch that allows access to the cylinder is at the top rear of the frame. The revolver is double-action only because of the absence of a cocking spur, intended to avoid snagging on clothing and firing accidentally. The lock was self-cocking and was slow to respond. The delay in response made accurate shooting virtually impossible. The cylinder contains a serious design flaw, with it only notching while the hammer is cocked. This allows the cylinder to revolve by being brushed against an object or the inertia from a sudden sideways motion. As the cylinder can move freely, an empty or already fired chamber can rotate into position instead of the next shot, a dangerous event for the user during combat. Later Type 26 Revolvers have grips with lateral serrations in place of an earlier knurled pattern as well as differences in external finish, depth, and look of die stamped markings. The bluing of the steel is excellent, even though the steel used is soft compared to Western standards. The 9mm Japanese revolver ammunition used by the Type 26 is unique to the weapon. Both the Type 26 Revolver and the ammunition used was later replaced by semi-automatic pistols such as the Nambu in the beginning of the 20th century. Five production periods Differences in markings and appearance across surviving Type 26 revolvers, has led to the categorization of production runs into five categories. =Limited early production with no markings= Early production Type 26s have no external markings. The revolvers have markings that indicate they were arsenal re- worked and believed to have been produced in late 1893 or early 1894 before official adoption. It is possible that around 300 revolvers with no external marking were produced. No known examples of Type 26 revolvers have duplicate serial numbers. =Limited early production= A small number of revolvers are known to have the external arsenal symbol stamped but without the external serial number stamped on the frame. The revolvers are interspersed among revolvers with standard production markings for unknown reasons. This production range has examples reported to chamber .38 S&W; ammunition but this could be because of later modification.Derby, Harry L. Japanese Military Cartridge Handguns 1893‚Äì1945 (2003), p. 21 =Standard production= All standard production Type 26s have checked pattern grip panels as well as original finished characteristics. Most standard production revolvers have a serial number that is between 1,000 and 58,900. Many of the standard production models suffered from extreme wear because of the long military service the revolvers served. =Limited final production= The final production revolvers were possibly produced after the Great Kant≈ç earthquake and possibly only 325 of these revolvers were produced. Known examples have serial numbers ranging from 58,903 and 59,227. =Arsenal reworked= Arsenal reworked Type 26s lack the bright charcoal blue finish or standard checked patterned grip panels. Serrated grip panels are common among reworked Type 26s and the marking of the Nagoya Arsenal indicate repairing of the Type 26 past its production at the Koshikawa Arsenal. Two existing arsenal reworked Type 26s show stampings of Siamese numerals on the front grips indicating official procurement by the Thai government. Two additional reworked Type 26s have a five-pointed star stamped on the side plate of the revolver indicating Indonesian service after World War II. Accessories =Holster= The Type 26 revolver was issued with a clamshell holster similar to the French Mod√®le 1892 revolver.Skennerton, Ian, Japanese Service Pistols Handbook (2008) p. 30 The earliest Type 26 holsters were black, and the cotton lanyards issued with them were a dark blue color known in Japan as kon.Derby, Harry L. Japanese Military Cartridge Handguns 1893‚Äì1945 (2003), p. 24 A leather pocket for the cleaning rod was provided, sewn onto the forward edge of the holster body. Most examples of holsters are stamped on the inside of the clamshell flap with the maker's identification and arsenal inspection markings with the year of manufacture. Very early holsters, issued in the late 1890s and early 1900s, were of a slightly different size and shape and without a pocket for the cleaning rod.Derby, Harry L. Japanese Military Cartridge Handguns 1893‚Äì1945 (2003), p. 25 A few holsters developed in 1943 have been noted to be all black lacquered hardware, missing the brass and galvanized steel fittings. Holsters produced towards the end of World War II have a last ditch fabric similar to late production Type 94 Nambu pistol holsters, with no shoulder straps or pouches for cleaning rods and ammunition. =Grenade launcher= The Type 90 tear gas grenade launcher was developed to be fired with the Type 26 revolver.Skennerton, Ian, Japanese Service Pistols Handbook (2008) p. 31 Gas grenades could be fired by a special 9x22 mm cartridge in place of the regular ball ammunition.

Development of the Type 94 pistol began in 1929, and after several redesigns the final prototype was tested and officially adopted by the Japanese Army in late 1934 (Japanese calendar, 2594). The Type 94 pistol entered production in 1935. Approximately 71,000 pistols were manufactured before production ended in 1945. The Type 94 pistol was designed for (and popular among) Japanese tank and aircraft crews who preferred a smaller, lightweight design. Japanese weapons experts have subsequently criticized some design elements of the Type 94; in particular the pistol could be fired unintentionally before the breech was fully locked if the sear bar on the side of the receiver was jarred loose and the pistol was improperly handled. Additionally, the process to disassemble the pistol is overly complex and awkward. The build quality of the Type 94 pistol declined over its production run; \\"last ditch\\" pistols made in 1945 were crudely manufactured. History The Type 94 Nambu pistol was designed by Kijiro Nambu after he retired from the Japanese Army and founded the Nambu Rifle Manufacturing Company.Derby, Harry L. Japanese Military Cartridge Handguns 1893‚Äì1945 (2003), p. 189 Design for the Type 94 Nambu pistol commenced in 1929 with the goal of reducing the bulk and price of previous Nambu designs. The Imperial Japanese Army felt a smaller pistol of domestic design that could accommodate the standard 8√ó22mm Nambu cartridge was needed to substitute the larger, heavier, and only official military pistol, the Type 14 Nambu. The demand for officer's handguns had increased as a result of Japan's invasion of Manchuria during the Second Sino-Japanese War. A new design was also wanted by the Japanese Army to include a magazine safety, to prevent unintentional discharges during cleaning that were common among Japanese personnel. Naming of the Type 94 pistol reflects the change in Japanese nomenclature with the 94 reckoning back to the mythical foundation of Japan in 660 BC therefore year 2594 instead of the traditional emperor reign period used to name the Type 26 revolver or Type 14 Nambu pistol.Hogg, Ian, Pistols of the World, 4th Edition, (2004) p. 234 The final prototype for the Type 94 was officially adopted by the Japanese Army in late 1934 after several redesigns. Production began under the supervision of the Nagoya Army Arsenal at the Nambu Rifle Manufacturing Company and later its successor, Chuo Kogyo Company, Ltd. An estimated 71,000 pistols were produced for the military but the exact quantity is unknown because of the production of unserialized pistols and undated pistols. During World War II the pistol became a preferred weapon for tank crews and paratroopers who required a smaller, more convenient pistol. The Type 94 was never officially adopted by the Imperial Japanese Navy but was available to officers through the Japanese officers' union. Design A Type 94 pistol from the HK Museum of History The Type 94 pistol is operated by a different mechanism than previous Japanese sidearms.Skennerton, Ian, Japanese Service Pistols Handbook (2008) p. 22 Unlike previously designed Nambu pistols, the Type 94 operates with a concealed hammer and with a firing pin rather than a hammer. According to authors, Harry L. Derby and James D. Brown, the firing pin is inherently weak and is prone to breakage because of a recess cut provided for the crossbolt and is prone to breaking at this point. The sturdier hammer firing mechanism was developed and included in the Type 94 to replace the poor striker on the Type 14 Nambu. The locking system is a rising- block type which floats independently between the lugs underneath the chamber end of the barrel. The single coil mainspring is positioned around the barrel instead of to the rear of the barrel as found on other Nambu pistols. The grip is smaller than other Japanese pistols and is finished with smooth woodSkennerton, Ian, Japanese Service Pistols Handbook (2008) p. 16 but according to author Jeff Kinard, are more comfortable for use by men with smaller hands.Kinard, Jeff. Pistols: An Illustrated History of Their Impact (2003), p. 247 The magazine holds a maximum of six rounds because of the smaller grip and it is considered difficult to reload the weapon, with pressure from the bolt holding it inside the pistol. The magazine catch protrudes far enough to occasionally disengage when the pistol is placed on its left side on a hard surface. The magazine could also disengage if squeezed into or jarred in a holster. The manual safety lever is located on the left rear of the frame and has the kanji for fire and safe stamped onto the frame. The front blade sight on the muzzle of the Type 94 pistol and the rear fixed V were occasionally inaccurately positioned making them useless when the weapon is being aimed. The rear sight was reduced from a U-shape to a simple notch in 1944 with the front blade being left unchanged but less attention to detail being applied as World War II progressed.Derby, Harry L. Japanese Military Cartridge Handguns 1893‚Äì1945 (2003), p. 207 =Final production= The quality of Type 94 Nambu pistols decreased towards the end of World War II as the Japanese faced bombing raids from allied forces and material shortages increased.Derby, Harry L. Japanese Military Cartridge Handguns 1893‚Äì1945 (2003), p. 219 This drastic change in quality from late March 1945, onwards with all quality standards appearing to disappear towards the end of June 1945.Derby, Harry L. Japanese Military Cartridge Handguns 1893‚Äì1945 (2003), p. 220 The smooth wooden finished grip was replaced by a bakelite checkered pattern. Many pistols were not serialized and no pistols have been reported that bear July 1945 manufacture date. Only four unserialized and undated pistols are known to exist and include mismatch parts with no inspection marks, lanyard loops, and extractors.Derby, Harry L. Japanese Military Cartridge Handguns 1893‚Äì1945 (2003), p. 221 A small number of pistols made during the final production stages include earlier production dates and appear to have been salvaged from previously discarded pistols that had minor or cosmetic defects. Disassembly Disassembly of the Type 94 Nambu pistol is considered difficult and can lead to damage to the pistol if done carelessly. After clearing the Type 94, the operator must draw the slide against the magazine follower to hold the bolt to the rear of the pistol. This will allow the crossbolt to be released after the firing pin is depressed. Removal of the crossbolt without depressing the firing pin will damage both the firing pin and the crossbolt.Derby, Harry L. Japanese Military Cartridge Handguns 1893‚Äì1945 (2003), p. 194 Removing the crossbolt is further complicated as the disassemblers hands are both holding the pistol and depressing the firing pin. Diagram showing the location of the sear bar that can be jarred loose and cause a misfire Holster Holsters for the Type 94 pistol were generally made from either pigskin or cowhide leather and ranged in color from tan to dark reddish brown.Derby, Harry L. Japanese Military Cartridge Handguns 1893‚Äì1945 (2003), p. 225 Holsters faced the same degradation in quality as the Type 94 pistol. As supplies of leather were exhausted in Japan, holsters manufactured in 1944 became fabricated from olive drab fabric. The Type 94 pistol holster is distinguishable from other Japanese holsters having a pointed closure flap and a vertically positioned magazine pouch.Derby, Harry L. Japanese Military Cartridge Handguns 1893‚Äì1945 (2003), p. 224 The pouch tow has a narrow extension to accommodate a cleaning rod. The majority of holsters were made in civilian owned tanneries with some ink stamped with arsenal and inspection marks.Derby, Harry L. Japanese Military Cartridge Handguns 1893‚Äì1945 (2003), p. 226 A belt loop and two shoulder strap \\"D\\" rings are provided on the rear of the holster and are made from brass, galvanized steel, or nickel plating. Unintentional firing The poor design of the breech allowed the Type 94 Nambu to be fired unintentionally. The sear bar on the Type 94 Nambu converts the forward pull of the trigger into a lateral movement that frees the hammer.Skennerton, Ian, Japanese Service Pistols Handbook (2008) p. 23 Because the sear bar is on the outside of the pistol, it could be jarred loose during engagement if the pistol was cocked and handled carelessly. The forward end of the sear bar would need to be depressed approximately 2mm to cause the weapon to fire. The ability to fire the Type 94 without pulling the trigger gave rise to war stories of Japanese soldiers surrendering, only to fire the pistol, earning the pistol monikers such as the \\"suicide special\\" and the \\"surrender pistol\\". These stories are widely discredited because of the difficulty to fire the weapon by squeezing the sear bar. If the safety is engaged on the Type 94 it is impossible for the weapon to discharge unintentionally.

Arc length s of a logarithmic spiral as a function of its parameter Œ∏. Arc length is the distance between two points along a section of a curve. Determining the length of an irregular arc segment is also called of a curve. The advent of infinitesimal calculus led to a general formula that provides closed-form solutions in some cases.  General approach  Approximation by multiple linear segments A curve in the plane can be approximated by connecting a finite number of points on the curve using line segments to create a polygonal path. Since it is straightforward to calculate the length of each linear segment (using the Pythagorean theorem in Euclidean space, for example), the total length of the approximation can be found by summing the lengths of each linear segment; that approximation is known as the (cumulative) chordal distance. If the curve is not already a polygonal path, using a progressively larger number of segments of smaller lengths will result in better approximations. The lengths of the successive approximations will not decrease and may keep increasing indefinitely, but for smooth curves they will tend to a finite limit as the lengths of the segments get arbitrarily small. For some curves there is a smallest number L that is an upper bound on the length of any polygonal approximation. These curves are called and the number L is defined as the . Definition for a smooth curve Let f\\\\colon[a,b]\\\\to\\\\R^n be a continuously differentiable function. The length of the curve defined by f can be defined as the limit of the sum of line segment lengths for a regular partition of [a,b] as the number of segments approaches infinity. This means :L(f)=\\\\lim_{N\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\biggf(t_i)-f(t_{i-1})\\\\bigg where t_i=a+i(b-a)/N=a+i\\\\Delta t for i=0,1,\\\\dotsc,N. This definition is equivalent to the standard definition of arc length as an integral: :\\\\lim_{N\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\biggf(t_i)-f(t_{i-1})\\\\bigg=\\\\lim_{N\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\left\\\\frac{f(t_i)-f(t_{i-1})}{\\\\Delta t}\\\\right\\\\Delta t=\\\\int_a^b \\\\Bigf'(t)\\\\Big\\\\ dt. The last equality above is true because of the following: (i) . (ii) the function f' is continuous, thus it is uniformly continuous, so there is a positive real function \\\\delta(\\\\epsilon) of positive real \\\\epsilon such that \\\\Delta t<\\\\delta(\\\\epsilon) implies \\\\left\\\\Bigf'(t_{i-1}+\\\\theta_i(t_i- t_{i-1}))\\\\Big-\\\\Bigf'(t_i)\\\\Big\\\\right<\\\\epsilon.

This means that in the limit N\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty, the left term above equals the right term, which is just the Riemann integral of f'(t) on [a,b]. This definition of arc length shows that the length of a curve f:[a,b]\\\\rightarrow\\\\mathbb{R}^n continuously differentiable on [a,b] is always finite. In other words, the curve is always rectifiable. The definition of arc length of a smooth curve as the integral of the norm of the derivative is equivalent to the definition :L(f)=\\\\sup\\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\biggf(t_i)-f(t_{i-1})\\\\bigg where the supremum is taken over all possible partitions a=t_0 of [a,b]. This definition is also valid if f is merely continuous, not differentiable. A curve can be parameterized in infinitely many ways. Let \\\\varphi:[a,b]\\\\to [c,d] be any continuously differentiable bijection. Then g=f\\\\circ\\\\varphi^{-1}:[c,d]\\\\to\\\\R^n is another continuously differentiable parameterization of the curve originally defined by f. The arc length of the curve is the same regardless of the parameterization used to define the curve: :\\\\begin{align} L(f) &= \\\\int_a^b \\\\Bigf'(t)\\\\Big\\\\ dt=\\\\int_a^b \\\\Bigg'(\\\\varphi(t))\\\\varphi'(t)\\\\Big\\\\ dt \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\int_a^b \\\\Bigg'(\\\\varphi(t))\\\\Big\\\\varphi'(t)\\\\ dt \\\\quad \\\\textrm{since} \\\\ \\\\varphi \\\\ \\\\textrm{must} \\\\ \\\\textrm{be} \\\\ \\\\textrm{non-decreasing} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\int_c^d \\\\Bigg'(u)\\\\Big\\\\ du \\\\quad \\\\textrm{using} \\\\ \\\\textrm{integration} \\\\ \\\\textrm{by} \\\\ \\\\textrm{substitution}\\\\\\\\\\\\ &= L(g). \\\\end{align} Finding arc lengths by integrating Quarter circle If a planar curve in \\\\mathbb{R}^2 is defined by the equation y=f(x), where f is continuously differentiable, then it is simply a special case of a parametric equation where x = t and y = f(t). The arc length is then given by: :s=\\\\int_a^b \\\\sqrt{1+\\\\left(\\\\frac{dy}{dx}\\\\right)^2}dx. Curves with closed-form solutions for arc length include the catenary, circle, cycloid, logarithmic spiral, parabola, semicubical parabola and straight line. The lack of a closed form solution for the arc length of an elliptic and hyperbolic arc led to the development of the elliptic integrals. =Numerical integration= In most cases, including even simple curves, there are no closed-form solutions for arc length and numerical integration is necessary. Numerical integration of the arc length integral is usually very efficient. For example, consider the problem of finding the length of a quarter of the unit circle by numerically integrating the arc length integral. The upper half of the unit circle can be parameterized as y=\\\\sqrt{1-x^2}. The interval x\\\\in [-\\\\sqrt{2}/2, \\\\sqrt{2}/2] corresponds to a quarter of the circle. Since dy/dx=-x/\\\\sqrt{1-x^2} and 1+(dy/dx)^2 = 1/(1-x^2), the length of a quarter of the unit circle is :\\\\int_{-\\\\sqrt{2}/2}^{\\\\sqrt{2}/2}\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1-x^2}} \\\\, dx. The 15-point Gauss‚ÄìKronrod rule estimate for this integral of differs from the true length of :\\\\Big[\\\\arcsin x\\\\Big]^{\\\\sqrt{2}/2}_{-\\\\sqrt{2}/2}=\\\\frac \\\\pi 2 by and the 16-point Gaussian quadrature rule estimate of differs from the true length by only . This means it is possible to evaluate this integral to almost machine precision with only 16 integrand evaluations. = Curve on a surface = Let \\\\mathbf{x}(u,v) be a surface mapping and let \\\\mathbf{C}(t) = (u(t), v(t)) be a curve on this surface. The integrand of the arc length integral is (\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\circ\\\\mathbf{C})'(t). Evaluating the derivative requires the chain rule for vector fields: : D(\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\circ \\\\mathbf{C}) = (\\\\mathbf{x}_u \\\\ \\\\mathbf{x}_v)\\\\binom{u'}{v'} = \\\\mathbf{x}_u u' + \\\\mathbf{x}_v v'. The squared norm of this vector is (\\\\mathbf{x}_u u' + \\\\mathbf{x}_v v') \\\\cdot (\\\\mathbf{x}_u u' + \\\\mathbf{x}_v v') = g_{11}(u')^2 + 2g_{12}u'v' + g_{22}(v')^2 (where g_{ij} is the first fundamental form coefficient), so the integrand of the arc length integral can be written as \\\\sqrt{g_{ab} (u^a)' (u^b)'} (where u^1 = u and u^2 = v ). = Other coordinate systems = Let \\\\mathbf{C}(t) = (r(t), \\\\theta(t)) be a curve expressed in polar coordinates. The mapping that transforms from polar coordinates to rectangular coordinates is :\\\\mathbf{x}(r,\\\\theta) = (r\\\\cos\\\\theta, r\\\\sin\\\\theta ). The integrand of the arc length integral is (\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\circ\\\\mathbf{C})'(t). The chain rule for vector fields shows that D(\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\circ \\\\mathbf{C}) = \\\\mathbf{x}_r r' + \\\\mathbf{x}_{\\\\theta} \\\\theta'. So the squared integrand of the arc length integral is :(\\\\mathbf{x_r}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{x_r})(r')^2 + 2(\\\\mathbf{x}_r\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{x}_{\\\\theta})r'\\\\theta' + (\\\\mathbf{x}_{\\\\theta}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{x}_{\\\\theta})(\\\\theta')^2 = (r')^2 + r^2(\\\\theta')^2. So for a curve expressed in polar coordinates, the arc length is :\\\\int_{t_1}^{t_2} \\\\sqrt{\\\\left(\\\\frac{dr}{dt}\\\\right)^2 + r^2\\\\left(\\\\frac{d\\\\theta}{dt}\\\\right)^2 }dt = \\\\int_{\\\\theta(t_1)}^{\\\\theta(t_2)} \\\\sqrt{\\\\left(\\\\frac{dr}{d\\\\theta}\\\\right)^2 + r^2}d\\\\theta. Now let \\\\mathbf{C}(t) = (r(t), \\\\theta(t), \\\\phi(t)) be a curve expressed in spherical coordinates where \\\\theta is the polar angle measured from the positive z-axis and \\\\phi is the azimuthal angle. The mapping that transforms from spherical coordinates to rectangular coordinates is :\\\\mathbf{x}(r,\\\\theta,\\\\phi) = (r\\\\sin\\\\theta\\\\cos\\\\phi, r\\\\sin\\\\theta\\\\sin\\\\phi, r\\\\cos\\\\theta). Using the chain rule again shows that D(\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\circ\\\\mathbf{C}) = \\\\mathbf{x}_r r' + \\\\mathbf{x}_{\\\\theta}\\\\theta' + \\\\mathbf{x}_{\\\\phi}\\\\phi'. All dot products \\\\mathbf{x}_i \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{x}_j where i and j differ are zero, so the squared norm of this vector is :(\\\\mathbf{x}_r\\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{x}_r )(r'^2) + (\\\\mathbf{x}_{\\\\theta} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{x}_{\\\\theta})(\\\\theta')^2 + (\\\\mathbf{x}_{\\\\phi}\\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{x}_{\\\\phi})(\\\\phi')^2 = (r')^2 + r^2(\\\\theta')^2 + r^2 \\\\sin^2\\\\theta (\\\\phi')^2. So for a curve expressed in spherical coordinates, the arc length is :\\\\int_{t_1}^{t_2} \\\\sqrt{\\\\left(\\\\frac{dr}{dt}\\\\right)^2 + r^2\\\\left(\\\\frac{d\\\\theta}{dt}\\\\right)^2 + r^2\\\\sin^2\\\\theta \\\\left(\\\\frac{d\\\\phi}{dt}\\\\right)^2}dt. A very similar calculation shows that the arc length of a curve expressed in cylindrical coordinates is :\\\\int_{t_1}^{t_2} \\\\sqrt{\\\\left(\\\\frac{dr}{dt}\\\\right)^2 + r^2\\\\left(\\\\frac{d\\\\theta}{dt}\\\\right)^2 + \\\\left(\\\\frac{dz}{dt}\\\\right)^2}dt.  Simple cases  = Arcs of circles = Arc lengths are denoted by s, since the Latin word for length (or size) is spatium. In the following lines, r represents the radius of a circle, d is its diameter, C is its circumference, s is the length of an arc of the circle, and \\\\theta is the angle which the arc subtends at the centre of the circle. The distances r, d, C, and s are expressed in the same units. * C=2\\\\pi r, which is the same as C=\\\\pi d. This equation is a definition of \\\\pi. * If the arc is a semicircle, then s=\\\\pi r. * For an arbitrary circular arc: ** If \\\\theta is in radians then s =r\\\\theta. This is a definition of the radian. ** If \\\\theta is in degrees, then s=\\\\frac{\\\\pi r \\\\theta}{180\\\\ \\\\text{deg}}, which is the same as s=\\\\frac{C \\\\theta}{360\\\\ \\\\text{deg}}. ** If \\\\theta is in grads (100 grads, or grades, or gradians are one right-angle), then s=\\\\frac{\\\\pi r \\\\theta}{200\\\\ \\\\text{grad}}, which is the same as s=\\\\frac{C \\\\theta}{400\\\\ \\\\text{grad}}. ** If \\\\theta is in turns (one turn is a complete rotation, or 360¬∞, or 400 grads, or 2\\\\pi radians), then s=C \\\\theta/\\\\text{turn}. Arcs of great circles on the Earth Two units of length, the nautical mile and the metre (or kilometre), were originally defined so the lengths of arcs of great circles on the Earth's surface would be simply numerically related to the angles they subtend at its centre. The simple equation s=\\\\theta applies in the following circumstances: :* if s is in nautical miles, and \\\\theta is in arcminutes ( degree), or :* if s is in kilometres, and \\\\theta is in centigrades ( grad). The lengths of the distance units were chosen to make the circumference of the Earth equal kilometres, or nautical miles. Those are the numbers of the corresponding angle units in one complete turn. Those definitions of the metre and the nautical mile have been superseded by more precise ones, but the original definitions are still accurate enough for conceptual purposes and some calculations. For example, they imply that one kilometre is exactly 0.54 nautical miles. Using official modern definitions, one nautical mile is exactly 1.852 kilometres, which implies that 1 kilometre is about nautical miles.CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, p. F-254 This modern ratio differs from the one calculated from the original definitions by less than one part in 10,000. = Length of an arc of a parabola = Historical methods =Antiquity= For much of the history of mathematics, even the greatest thinkers considered it impossible to compute the length of an irregular arc. Although Archimedes had pioneered a way of finding the area beneath a curve with his \\"method of exhaustion\\", few believed it was even possible for curves to have definite lengths, as do straight lines. The first ground was broken in this field, as it often has been in calculus, by approximation. People began to inscribe polygons within the curves and compute the length of the sides for a somewhat accurate measurement of the length. By using more segments, and by decreasing the length of each segment, they were able to obtain a more and more accurate approximation. In particular, by inscribing a polygon of many sides in a circle, they were able to find approximate values of œÄ. =17th century= In the 17th century, the method of exhaustion led to the rectification by geometrical methods of several transcendental curves: the logarithmic spiral by Evangelista Torricelli in 1645 (some sources say John Wallis in the 1650s), the cycloid by Christopher Wren in 1658, and the catenary by Gottfried Leibniz in 1691. In 1659, Wallis credited William Neile's discovery of the first rectification of a nontrivial algebraic curve, the semicubical parabola. The accompanying figures appear on page 145. On page 91, William Neile is mentioned as Gulielmus Nelius. =Integral form= Before the full formal development of calculus, the basis for the modern integral form for arc length was independently discovered by Hendrik van Heuraet and Pierre de Fermat. In 1659 van Heuraet published a construction showing that the problem of determining arc length could be transformed into the problem of determining the area under a curve (i.e., an integral). As an example of his method, he determined the arc length of a semicubical parabola, which required finding the area under a parabola. In 1660, Fermat published a more general theory containing the same result in his De linearum curvarum cum lineis rectis comparatione dissertatio geometrica (Geometric dissertation on curved lines in comparison with straight lines). Fermat's method of determining arc length Building on his previous work with tangents, Fermat used the curve : y = x^{3/2} \\\\, whose tangent at x = a had a slope of : \\\\textstyle {3 \\\\over 2} a^{1/2} so the tangent line would have the equation : y = \\\\textstyle {3 \\\\over 2} {a^{1/2}}(x - a) + f(a). Next, he increased a by a small amount to a + Œµ, making segment AC a relatively good approximation for the length of the curve from A to D. To find the length of the segment AC, he used the Pythagorean theorem: : \\\\begin{align} AC^2 &{}= AB^2 + BC^2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ &{} = \\\\textstyle \\\\varepsilon^2 + {9 \\\\over 4} a \\\\varepsilon^2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ &{}= \\\\textstyle \\\\varepsilon^2 \\\\left (1 + {9 \\\\over 4} a \\\\right ) \\\\end{align} which, when solved, yields :AC = \\\\textstyle \\\\varepsilon \\\\sqrt { 1 + {9 \\\\over 4} a\\\\ }. In order to approximate the length, Fermat would sum up a sequence of short segments. Curves with infinite length The Koch curve. The graph of xsin(1/x). As mentioned above, some curves are non-rectifiable. That is, there is no upper bound on the lengths of polygonal approximations; the length can be made arbitrarily large. Informally, such curves are said to have infinite length. There are continuous curves on which every arc (other than a single-point arc) has infinite length. An example of such a curve is the Koch curve. Another example of a curve with infinite length is the graph of the function defined by f(x) = x sin(1/x) for any open set with 0 as one of its delimiters and f(0) = 0. Sometimes the Hausdorff dimension and Hausdorff measure are used to quantify the size of such curves. Generalization to (pseudo-)Riemannian manifolds Let M be a (pseudo-)Riemannian manifold, \\\\gamma:[0,1]\\\\rightarrow M a curve in M and g the (pseudo-) metric tensor. The length of \\\\gamma is defined to be :\\\\ell(\\\\gamma)=\\\\int_{0}^{1} \\\\sqrt{ \\\\pm g(\\\\gamma'(t),\\\\gamma '(t)) } \\\\, dt, where \\\\gamma'(t)\\\\in T_{\\\\gamma(t)}M is the tangent vector of \\\\gamma at t. The sign in the square root is chosen once for a given curve, to ensure that the square root is a real number. The positive sign is chosen for spacelike curves; in a pseudo-Riemannian manifold, the negative sign may be chosen for timelike curves. Thus the length of a curve is a non-negative real number. Usually no curves are considered which are partly spacelike and partly timelike. In theory of relativity, arc length of timelike curves (world lines) is the proper time elapsed along the world line, and arc length of a spacelike curve the proper distance along the curve.

He also was the CEO of the New England Patriots of the National Football League and president and general manager of the Las Vegas Gladiators of the Arena Football League.  College  A native of Butte, Montana, Jankovich earned a letter in football in 1957 at the University of Montana in Missoula, then known as Montana State University. His playing career was cut short by a serious knee injury; Jankovich tried to give his scholarship back but Grizzly coach Jerry Williams refused his offer.  Coaching career  After graduation, Jankovich became a football coach at Butte High School, where he won two state championships. He later became an assistant coach at Montana State University in Bozeman under head coach Jim Sweeney. In 1968, he followed Sweeney to Washington State University in Pullman, where he served as head assistant coach and defensive coordinator. He left coaching in 1972, when he became an assistant to the athletic director at Washington State.  Athletic administrator  After several years as an assistant athletic director, Jankovich succeeded Ray Nagel as WSU's athletic director in August 1976. He established a reputation for building athletic facilities, primarily expanding Martin Stadium in 1979 by lowering the field and removing the track. This required the addition of the new Mooberry track facility and the relocation of the baseball stadium. In 1983, Jankovich took a job as athletic director at the University of Miami in southern Florida, and held this position until 1990. During his tenure, Miami's football team rose to perennial national power and men's basketball returned after a 15-year absence. Jankovich oversaw several national championships including three in football and one each in baseball, men's and women's tennis, and women's golf.  NFL  In December 1990, Jankovich was hired by Victor Kiam as Chief Executive Officer of the New England Patriots. He was hired to rebuild the team after a league-worst 1‚Äì13 finish, while being plagued by off-the-field problems. He left after two seasons, as the Patriots went 6‚Äì10 in 1991 and 2‚Äì14 in 1992.  Later life  Jankovich then worked as a consultant to various corporations and universities including doing fundraising for the U.S. Olympic Committee. He would eventually become president and general manager of the Las Vegas Gladiators of the Arena Football League. 1979 highway collision In the summer of 1979, Jankovich was involved in a fatal highway collision north of Pullman on a Sunday afternoon. He apparently fell asleep at the wheel and crossed the center line, but did not face criminal charges.

The exact role and identity of Rauni is debated, and theories range from Rauni having been a mother goddess and consort of Ukko to being identified with Ukko himself. Interpretations The opinion among scholars concerning the role of Rauni in Finnish mythology is varied. Some Rauni interpret as a name for the consort of Ukko, the Finnish god of thunder. Some also identify Rauni with the rowan tree, citing the reconstructed Old Norse form *raunir (English: rowan) as linguistic evidence. Others still, among them Martti Haavio, contend that Rauni is simply an epithet for a deity called Ukko, who may or may not be the well-known Finnish thunder god, and that the other theories are based on misreading a poem documenting Finnish Pre-Christian belief authored by Mikael Agricola.

It has many applications in sieve theory. It is named for Peter D. T. A. Elliott and Heini Halberstam, who stated the conjecture in 1968. Stating the conjecture requires some notation. Let \\\\pi(x), the prime counting function, denote the number of primes less than or equal to x. If q is a positive integer and a is coprime to q, we let \\\\pi(x;q,a) denote the number of primes less than or equal to x which are equal to a modulo q. Dirichlet's theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions then tells us that : \\\\pi(x;q,a) \\\\approx \\\\frac{\\\\pi(x)}{\\\\varphi(q)} where \\\\varphi is Euler's totient function. If we then define the error function : E(x;q) = \\\\max_{\\\\text{gcd}(a,q) = 1} \\\\left\\\\pi(x;q,a) - \\\\frac{\\\\pi(x)}{\\\\varphi(q)}\\\\right where the max is taken over all a coprime to q, then the Elliott‚ÄìHalberstam conjecture is the assertion that for every \\\\theta < 1 and A > 0 there exists a constant C > 0 such that : \\\\sum_{1 \\\\leq q \\\\leq x^\\\\theta} E(x;q) \\\\leq \\\\frac{C x}{\\\\log^A x} for all x > 2. This conjecture was proven for all \\\\theta < 1/2 by Enrico Bombieri and A. I. Vinogradov Corrigendum. ibid. 30 (1966), pages 719-720. (Russian) (the Bombieri‚ÄìVinogradov theorem, sometimes known simply as \\"Bombieri's theorem\\"); this result is already quite useful, being an averaged form of the generalized Riemann hypothesis. It is known that the conjecture fails at the endpoint \\\\theta = 1. The Elliott‚ÄìHalberstam conjecture has several consequences. One striking one is the result announced by Dan Goldston, J√°nos Pintz, and Cem Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m,; see also , . which shows (assuming this conjecture) that there are infinitely many pairs of primes which differ by at most 16. In November 2013, James Maynard showed that subject to the Elliott‚ÄìHalberstam conjecture, one can show the existence of infinitely many pairs of consecutive primes that differ by at most 12. In August 2014, Polymath group showed that subject to the generalized Elliott‚ÄìHalberstam conjecture, one can show the existence of infinitely many pairs of consecutive primes that differ by at most 6. Without assuming any form of the conjecture, the lowest proven bound is 246.

It is to be distinguished in modern heraldry from the fusil, which is like the lozenge but narrower, though the distinction has not always been as fine and is not always observed even today. A mascle is a voided lozenge‚Äîthat is, a lozenge with a lozenge- shaped hole in the middle‚Äîand the rarer rustre is a lozenge containing a circular hole in the centre. A field covered in a pattern of lozenges is described as lozengy; similar fields of mascles are masculy, and fusils, fusily (see Variation of the field). In civic heraldry, a lozenge sable is often used in coal-mining communities to represent a lump of coal. A lozenge shaped escutcheon is used to depict heraldry for a female (in continental Europe especially an unmarried woman), but is also sometimes used as a shape for mural monuments in churches which commemorate females.For example the lozenge shaped monument to Arabella Morgan (1741-1828) in St Andrew's Church, High Ham, Somerset, see image :File:St Andrew's Church, High Ham2.jpg Funerary hatchments are generally shown within lozenge shaped frames, for both male and female deceased. Lozengy The blason Lozengy is a form of variation of the field or of another charge (for example a chevron lozengy) which consists of lozenges sem√©e, or sown like seeds (Latin: semen, a seed), or strewn across the field, but in an organised contiguous pattern. The arms granted to the Canadian John Francis Cappucci bring an example of lozengy voided, the same as \\"lozengy\\" but with a smaller lozenge-shaped hole cut out of each segment.

Trust certificate of the Cincinnati, Hamilton & Dayton Railroad Company, issued 8. June 1883 The Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton Railroad (CH&D;) was a railroad based in the U.S. state of Ohio that existed between its incorporation on March 2, 1846, and its acquisition by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in December 1917. (This railroad should not be confused with the Cincinnati, Hamilton & Dayton Railway, an Ohio interurban of exactly the same name which existed between 1926 and 1930.) It was originally chartered to build from Cincinnati to Hamilton, Ohio, and then to Dayton, a distance of ; further construction and acquisition extended the railroad, and by 1902 it owned or controlled of railroad. Its stock and bond value plunged in late 1905 after \\"financial mismanagement of the properties\\" was revealed.  Acquisitions  Map of the CH&D; in 1896 The original CH&D; was founded by John Alexander Collins, who was born on June 8, 1815 in Staffordshire, England. He came to the US as a child in 1825, and worked as a locomotive engineer until moving to Ohio in 1851 to open the CH&D.; Collins remained with the line until 1872, six years before his death in Covington, Kentucky. Collins is buried in Woodland Cemetery in Dayton, where his tombstone details his life and its work. The railway received a charter from the State of Ohio on March 2, 1846 as the \\"Cincinnati and Hamilton Railroad\\". The name was changed by the legislature to the Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton Railway on February 8, 1847. Work on the road began in 1850, and by September of that year the right of way had been obtained between Cincinnati and Hamilton, with the right of way between Hamilton and Dayton being sought. The road was graded by this time as well, since iron for the rails had arrived. By May 1851, the entire right of way was purchased and grading along the entire route finished. The first trains ran on September 18, 1851: Two special inaugural trains from Dayton met two special inaugural trains from Cincinnati at Hamilton. On May 1, 1863, the CH&D; leased the Dayton and Michigan Railroad in perpetuity. In 1891, it acquired the Cincinnati, Dayton and Chicago Railroad, while in March of that year it added the Cincinnati, Dayton and Ironton Railroad. In 1886 the CH&D; was among the railroads controlled by the financial speculator Henry S. Ives before his spectacular collapse the following year.  The CH&D; in Lima, Ohio  The Dayton and Michigan was the second railroad to reach Lima, Ohio, reaching there in 1858. By 1880, they had established a significant shop facility on the north side of town with over two hundred employees. The Detroit and Michigan had a freight depot west of the tracks and south of East North Street, between North Central Avenue (once Tanner Street) and North Jackson Street. Successor CH&D; built a larger structure on the site, which continued to be used by the Baltimore and Ohio at least into the 1950s. The passenger depot followed a similar pattern, but was located farther north, between East Wayne Street and the Pennsylvania Railroad tracks.

Naybet spent the longest and most successful period of his career with Deportivo La Coru√±a in Spain's La Liga, from 1996 to 2004. He won one La Liga league title in 1999‚Äì2000 La Liga , one Copa del Rey and 2 Spanish Super Cup. and for Sporting CP won Cup of Portugal Naybet also earned 115 caps for the Moroccan national team, scoring two goals. He spent most of his 17-year professional career with Deportivo, appearing in 284 competitive games and winning four major titles, including the 2000 national championship. He also competed in France, Portugal and England. Naybet played a record 115 matches for the Moroccan national team, representing the country in two World Cups and six Africa Cup of Nations tournaments. Club career Born in Casablanca, Naybet started playing with local Wydad, being part of the squads that won three Botola championships as well as the 1992 edition of the CAF Champions League. From 1993 to 1996 he represented FC Nantes (France) and Sporting Clube de Portugal, being always an important first-team member and winning one domestic cup in each country. In the 1996 summer Naybet signed a four-year deal with Spain's Deportivo de La Coru√±a, for roughly ‚Ç¨1.6 million. He made his La Liga debut on 31 August 1996, playing the full 90 minutes in a 1‚Äì1 home draw against Real Madrid. Naybet scored a career best four goals in the 1997‚Äì98 season, but the Galicians could only finish in 12th position. He was still an undisputed starter in 1999‚Äì2000 ‚Äì often partnering Argentine Gabriel Sch√ºrrer ‚Äì as the club conquered the first league in its history. Naybet started in all his 13 UEFA Champions League appearances in the 2003‚Äì04 campaign, helping D√©por to the semi-finals of the competition. In the last-four's second leg, at home against FC Porto, he was sent off by Pierluigi Collina after two bookable offenses, and the tie ended 1‚Äì0 in favour of the Portuguese. On 12 August 2004, aged 34, Naybet joined Tottenham Hotspur for a reported fee of ¬£700,000. He netted his first and only goal for the Spurs on 13 November, in a 4‚Äì5 North London derby loss to Arsenal at White Hart Lane. After only three games in 2005‚Äì06, under new manager Martin Jol, Naybet was released and retired from football. In June 2005, however, he had renewed his contract for a further season. International career Naybet was a Moroccan international for 16 years, gaining his first cap on 9 August 1990 in a 0‚Äì0 friendly draw in Tunisia. He proceeded to appear for his country in two FIFA World Cups, playing two games in 1994 and three in 1998 as both editions ended in group stage elimination. Naybet played all six contests in the 2004 African Cup of Nations, helping the Atlas Lions finish second in Tunisia. In early January 2006, five months after announcing his international retirement after falling out of favour with coach Ezzaki Badou, he returned to the national team just ahead of the 2006 Africa Cup of Nations. In August 2007, Naybet was named assistant manager under Henri Michel. Personal life A devout Muslim, Naybet observed fasting during the month of Ramadan, even when it coincided with the football season.

This is slightly earlier than in other western rites, in which the fraction typically takes place at some point after the Our Father. The method of the fraction varies from a simple breaking into pieces by hand to a more elaborate cutting with a liturgical knife known as a spear, as is commonly done in the Byzantine rite. The action is accompanied by the singing of a responsory drawn both from the Emmaus account in the Gospel of Luke (Luke 24:13-35) and a selection from the opening verses of chapter 9 of the Book of Proverbs. > Wisdom has built her house; she has founded it on her seven pillars; she has > sacrificed her victims, mingled her wine, and set her table. > They recognised the Lord. Alleluia. In the breaking of the bread. Alleluia. > Alleluia. > Come and eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mixed. Leave > ignorance and you shall live. > They recognised the Lord. Alleluia. In the breaking of the bread. Alleluia. > Alleluia. > The bread which we break is the Body of the Lord; the cup which we bless is > the Blood of the Lord: a sole and unique Mystery. > They recognised the Lord. Alleluia. In the breaking of the bread. Alleluia. > Alleluia. From Septuagesima until the end of Holy Week, the alleluia is omitted, and the responsory is sung more simply to Gregorian psalm tone 2. =Anglican= In the churches of the Anglican Communion, the rite is similar to that practised in the Roman Catholic Church, and consists of the priest breaking the Host in half and making an exclamation, such as, \\"We break this bread to share in the body of Christ\\", and the faithful making a response, such as, \\"Though we are many we are one body, because we all share in one bread\\" The response may change during certain liturgical seasons, or according to the rite being celebrated. A Fraction Anthem may be sung or spoken during the rite. Eastern Christian the Lamb and particles as they are placed on the diskos (paten) during the Divine Liturgy. In the Eastern Orthodox Church and Eastern Catholic Churches of the Byzantine rite, leavened bread is used for the Eucharist. The round loaves, or prosphora, are stamped so that a Greek cross is in the center, with the letters \\"IC XC NI-KA\\" (Greek for \\"Jesus Christ conquers\\") occupying the quarters formed by the cross' arms. The square portion occupied by this stamp, the \\"Lamb\\", is cut out before the Divine Liturgy during the preparatory rite and is the only part consecrated during the Epiclesis. As part of the Liturgy of Preparation, the priest cuts the Lamb part way through crosswise into four sections from the bottom, leaving the bread united by the stamped crust on top. At the Fraction, which follows the Lord's Prayer and the Elevation, the celebrant breaks the Lamb into four portions along the cuts already made, as he says the words: \\"Broken and divided is the Lamb of God, which is broken and not disunited, which is ever eaten and never consumed, but sanctifieth those that partake thereof.\\" He then arranges the four pieces crosswise on the edge of the diskos (paten). On the invitation of the deacon, \\"Fill, Master, the holy chalice,\\" the celebrant takes the piece with the letters \\"IC\\" and places it into the chalice saying, \\"The fulness of the cup, of the faith, of the Holy Spirit.\\" The portion with the letters \\"XC\\" is used for the communion of the clergy. The two portions \\"NI\\" and \\"KA\\" are divided into small pieces and placed in the chalice for the communion of the people. The portion \\"IC\\" is not used for communion, but is consumed by the deacon along with any other consecrated elements left over at the end of the Liturgy (see Ablution in Christianity).

It was absorbed in 1930 into the new Cincinnati and Lake Erie interurban railway. In typical interurban fashion, in open country it had its own right of way, although this was often adjacent and parallel to a road. In cities and towns it operated on city streets. This included two and three car freight/express trains as well as passenger cars. Creation of the Cincinnati Hamilton and Dayton In 1926, the former Cincinnati and Dayton Traction Company was reorganised under the new name Cincinnati, Hamilton, and Dayton. The C&DTC; right-of-way was part of the former Ohio Electric Railway's line between Dayton and Cincinnati. This new interurban company (which had no relationship with the steam railroad of the same name which eventually was absorbed by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad) was headed by a former Univ of Penn Wharton School professor of finance, Dr. Thomas Conway, Jr., who had already been successful in reviving the interurban Chicago, Aurora, and Elgin Railroad. He ordered badly needed all steel interurban coaches,Middleton, Wm: The Interurban Era, p. 148: excellent photograph of three new \\"100 class\\" Kuhlman Car Company 1926 built CH&D; interurbans on a bridge box-motor express cars and freight cars, and spent heavily to improve track and right-of-way, although the original 1900s rails laid within the brick streets of the cities and towns such as Dayton remained a maintenance problem and were a source of constant arguments with township administrations. Not only were the towns unhappy about who was to pay for street repairs and snow removal, they complained about the long and heavy interurban cars mixing in with growing 1920s automobile traffic. Conway did well at building up the CH&D; freight business utilizing his new interurban freight equipment which often was operated at night, and by virtue of his wide contacts in the railroad industry was more than ordinarily successful in establishing through rates for LCL (less-than-boxcar load freight) with some steam railroads, not an easy thing to accomplish for an interurban. Conway believed that there was still a place for the interurban in medium distance passenger traffic and longer distance LCL freight, and thus conceived the idea of the CH&D.; Corporate concerns Three problems worried CH&D; management: that the CH&D;'s neighboring interurban lines might stop running due to financial problems and break their vital freight interchange with the CH&D; that more and more towns were restricting the operation of freight trains over their streets to nighttime only; that interest payments on the very large CH&D; bonded debt of $1.3 million borrowed in 1926 could not be met through operating revenue. 1926 was a time when many people earned between $1000 and $2000 a year, and a good dinner could be purchased for fifty cents. Expansion makes the CH&D; become the C&LE; In 1930, just as the Great Depression was starting but no one knew how bad it would be, Conway purchased and merged his profitable CH&D; with two essential connecting interurbans Indiana, Columbus and Eastern, and the Lima- Toledo Railroad, to form the Cincinnati and Lake Erie Railroad. This new line now connected Cincinnati in southern Ohio with Toledo in northern Ohio. Conway then borrowed even more money ($3.7 million in bonds and new corporate stock) and ordered more new equipment, including the innovative light weight aluminum body high speed passenger car \\"Red Devils\\" from the Cincinnati Car Company.Middleton, Wm.: The Interurban Era, pp. 147-150 for photographs and history With two other vitally important for C&LE; survival interurban connections at Toledo, the new C&LE; provided through interurban passenger and freight service east to Cleveland (Lake Shore Electric) and north to Detroit (Eastern Michigan Railway). The Red Devils operated directly from Cincinnati to Detroit for a while. Freight trains running from Cincinnati through Dayton and Toledo to Cleveland provided the longest continuous and same equipment interurban freight service to ever existing in the United States. Although each year the C&LE; shipped more and more freight, the only year that it was profitable was 1936, Keenan, Jack \\"Cincinnati and Lake Erie Railroad,\\" 226p, Golden West Books, 1974, chapters 3-5. The accelerating collapse of the American economy through the late 1930s led to further C&LE; financial losses and a steady decline in operations. The two essential Toledo connecting interurban lines closed due to bankruptcy, the Detroit connection earlier in 1932, and the more important for freight Cleveland connection in 1938, and the C&LE; was doomed. It abandoned in 1939.

The music created in this period helped create a distinct identity for modern Sarajevo and make the city the center of Yugoslav rock. The regional influence of the Sarajevo pop rock school has been tremendous, significantly shaping the popular music of the former Yugoslav republics to this day. The start of the Yugoslav wars and the siege of Sarajevo are generally considered to mark the end of the era. The roots of the movement can be found in the 1960s when some of the first local bands, such as Indexi and Pauci, first appeared. By the 1970s, the Sarajevo scene had grown considerably while still retaining the same central figures at the helm. Sarajevo bands such as Bijelo dugme influenced heavily by progressive and classical rock bands such as Deep Purple and Led Zeppelin, soon became idols of the country's youth. Unlike elsewhere, the movement was not slowed down by the punk rock explosion of the late 1970s. Rather, older bands diversified, exploring genres such as pop and folk, while the younger generation of musicians neatly incorporated themselves into the movement while building upon influences such as punk rock and new wave. Noted bands from the later period include Merlin, Plavi orkestar, Divlje jagode, Zabranjeno pu≈°enje, Crno Vino, Crvena jabuka, Bolero and Regina.

New York City became the capital of national communications, trade, and finance, and of popular culture and high culture. More than one-fourth of the 300 largest corporations in 1920 were headquartered there.David R. Goldfield and Blaine A. Brownell, Urban America: A History(2nd ed. 1990), p 299 The era began with the formation of the consolidated city of the five boroughs in 1898, with a total population of 3.4 million. New transportation links, especially the New York City Subway, opened in 1904, bound together the new metropolis. Increased immigration of unskilled Catholic and Jewish workers from Southern and Eastern Europe expanded the labor force until the World War ended immigration in 1914. Labor shortages during the war attracted African Americans from the Southeast, who headed north as part of the Great Migration. They sponsored the Harlem Renaissance of literature and culture celebrating the black experience. The Roaring Twenties were years of glamour and wealth, highlighted by a construction boom, with skyscrapers built higher and higher in the famous skyline. New York's financial sector came to dominate the national and the world economies. The economy of New York City prospered after 1896, with a few short dips, until the decade-long Great Depression, which began with a Wall Street stock market crash in late 1929. The economy recovered by 1940 and flourished during the World War II years. The main bases of the economy were construction, ocean shipping, garments, machine tools, and printing. Labor unions rose and fell and rose again. New York boasted the nation's strongest financial system, a large upscale market for luxury goods, and a flourishing high culture based on many philanthropists, museums, galleries, universities, artists, writers, and publications. The Democratic political machines in the boroughs generally controlled politics. However, they were finally overthrown in 1933 by reformers who elected and repeatedly re-elected Fiorello La Guardia. Heavy federal patronage helped convert the city into a stronghold of the New Deal Coalition and the model of heavy government spending on infrastructure.For a visual overview of the era, see Eric Homberger, The historical atlas of New York City: A visual celebration of 400 years of New York City's history (Macmillan, 2005), pp 114‚Äì145.  Progressive Era: 1890s‚Äì1920s  The Woolworth Building, built in 1913 The modern five boroughs, comprising the city of New York, were united in 1898. That year, the cities of New York‚Äîwhich then consisted of present-day Manhattan and the Bronx‚Äîand Brooklyn were both consolidated with the largely rural areas of Queens and Staten Island.David C. Hammack, \\"Reflections on the Creation of the Greater City of New York and Its First Charter, 1898.\\" New York Law School Law Review 42 (1988) pp: 693+ The total population was 3.4 million in 1900, leaping to 5.6 million in 1920 and leveling off at 7.9 million in 1950. The population was highly diverse in terms of ethnicity, race, religion and class.Lawrence A. Cremin, American Education: The Metropolitan Experience 1876‚Äì1980 (1988) pp 576‚Äì577 The city went through an enormous growth in population, industry, and wealth. The major achievements included the building of the subway system by private enterprise. The city funded major new bridges between Manhattan and Brooklyn and Queens, which facilitated commuting and the rise of an industrial base in those boroughs. The city also expanded its port facilities, improved its traffic system, built hundreds of new elementary and high schools, and engaged in large-scale public health programs. Many early skyscrapers, including several of the world's tallest buildings, were erected in Manhattan as well. = Machine politics versus the reformers = The politics of the consolidated city revolved around conflicts between the political machines and the reformers. In the quiet times, the machines had a solid core of supporters and usually exercised control of city and borough affairs; they also played a major role in the state legislature in Albany. Tammany Hall from the 1880s and onward built a strong network of local clubs that attracted ambitious middle- class ethnics.Roy V. Peel, The Political Clubs of New York City (1935).Martin Shefter, \\"The electoral foundations of the political machine: New York City, 1884‚Äì1897.\\" in Joel Silbey et al. eds., The history of American electoral behavior (1978), pp. 263‚Äì298. In times of crisis however, especially in the severe depressions of the 1890s and the 1930s, the reformers took control of key offices, notably the mayor's office. The reformers were never unified; they operated through a complex network of independent civic reform groups, each focusing its lobbying efforts on its own particular reform agenda. Membership included civic-minded, well-educated middle-class men and women, usually with expert skills in a profession or business, who deeply distrusted the corruption of the machines.Richard Skolnik, \\"Civic Group Progressivism In New York City,\\" New York History (1970) 51#5, pp. 411‚Äì439. Consolidation in 1898 multiplied the power of these reform groups, whenever they could agree on a common agenda such as consolidation itself.David C. Hammack, Power and Society: Greater New York at the Turn of the Century (1982), pp. 308‚Äì313. Huron Club, formerly a neighborhood Democratic club There was no citywide machine. Instead, Democratic machines flourished in each of the boroughs, with Tammany Hall in Manhattan the most prominent. They typically had strong neighborhood organizations, known as \\"political clubs\\", as well as one prominent leader often called \\"the boss\\". Charles Murphy was the highly effective but quiet boss of Tammany Hall from 1902‚Äì1924.J.

Most of the time they looked to Albany and Washington, D.C., for their sphere of influence.Jackson, Encyclopedia of New York City, (1996), pp. 914, 999, 1149‚Äì1151.Marvin G. Weinbaum, \\"New York County Republican Politics, 1897‚Äì1922: The Quarter-Century After Municipal Consolidation.\\" New York Historical Society Quarterly (1966) 50#1, pp. 62‚Äì70. Seth Low, the president of Columbia University, was elected the reform mayor in 1901. He lacked the common touch and lost much of his working class support when he listened to Prohibitionists eager to crack down on the liquor business.\\"Seth Low,\\" in Jackson,Encyclopedia of New York City, (1996), p. 695.Steven C. Swett, \\"The Test of a Reformer: A Study of Seth Low, New York City Mayor, 1902‚Äì1903,\\" New-York Historical Society Quarterly (1960) 44#1, pp. 5‚Äì41. The spirit of the progressive era infused New York politics, energizing the reformers with a condemnation of inefficiency, waste, and corruption. An emphasis was placed on expertise and scientific organization of large scale projects.Kenneth Finegold, \\"Traditional Reform, Municipal Populism, and Progressivism Challenges to Machine Politics in Early-Twentieth-Century New York City.\\" Urban Affairs Review (1995) 31#1, pp. 20‚Äì42. Tammany Hall went along, under the new leadership of Charles Francis Murphy. It promoted a reform image itself, sponsored reformers as mayor, and downplayed overt forms of corruption, graft, and bribery.George J. Lankevich, American Metropolis: A History of New York City (1998), pp. 138‚Äì155. The Irish remained in control of Tammany, and the leadership had many opportunities for what Alderman George Washington Plunkett called \\"honest graft\\" such as an inside track to lucrative construction contracts without any stealing or committing illegal acts. Three reformers became mayor. Seth Low, prominent Brooklyn businessman, experienced politician, and president of Columbia University, united reformers and the Republicans in a fusion ticket that won the mayor's race in 1902. Tammany was back in 1904 with a prestigious reformer, George B. McClellan Jr., the son of the famous Civil War general and an experienced politician in his own right. William Jay Gaynor, reform judge, won the Tammany nomination in 1909. Fusion reformer John Purroy Mitchel, a favorite of President Woodrow Wilson, was elected in 1913. Mitchel had strong support from the progressives, enabling him to reorganize the bureaucracy, crackdown on vice, and make taxation more efficient. Mitchel's support for the Allies in the World War alienated Germans, and the working classes were alarmed at his plans for vocational education. He was defeated in 1917 by John Francis Hylan; Hylan was re-elected in 1921 and collaborated closely with Hearst until he was ousted by Al Smith and Tammany in 1925.Robert A. Slayton, Empire Statesman: The Rise and Redemption of Al Smith (2001), pp. 221‚Äì224. Tammany realized it needed reformers on the ticket, but it had a hard time working with them. It needed McClellan to run for re-election in 1905 to beat off the tremendous challenge by independent publisher William Randolph Hearst. But in 1906 Tammany cut a deal and supported Hearst for governor, so McClellan broke with the machine.Ben Procter, William Randolph Hearst: The Early Years, 1863‚Äì1910 (1998), pp. 203‚Äì211, 220‚Äì227. Gaynor proved much more independent than expected and was denied renomination.Lately Thomas, The Mayor who Mastered New York: The Life and Opinions of William J. Gaynor (1969). = Transportation = Pennsylvania Station, opened in 1910 The municipal consolidation precipitated greater physical connections between the boroughs. The building of the New York City Subway opened with the first IRT line in 1904. Initially the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) and Brooklyn- Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT) systems (with a third system, the Independent Subway System or IND, to be incorporated in 1925) were separate. They immediately became a force for further population spread and development. The opening of the Williamsburg Bridge in 1903 and the Manhattan Bridge in 1909 further connected Manhattan to the rapidly expanding bedroom community in Brooklyn. The world-famous Grand Central Terminal opened as the world's largest train station on February 1, 1913, replacing an earlier terminal on the site. The Pennsylvania Station, a similarly large and grand railway station several blocks to the west that was torn down in 1963, had opened in 1910.William D. Middleton, Grand Central, the World's Greatest Railway Terminal (1977). = Immigrant life = The Sunday magazine of the New York World appealed to immigrants with this April 29, 1906 cover page celebrating their arrival at Ellis Island.Nicholson Baker and Margaret Brentano, eds. The World on Sunday: Graphic Art in Joseph Pulitzer's Newspaper (1898‚Äì1911) (2005) p 85 European immigration escalated exponentially during the early 20th century; the new arrivals were mostly Catholics or Jews, especially Italians and Poles as well as Yiddish-speaking Jews from Eastern Europe.Samuel L. Baily, \\"The Adjustment of Italian Immigrants in Buenos Aires and New York, 1870‚Äì1914.\\" American Historical Review (1983): pp 281‚Äì305. in JSTORIrving Howe, World of Our Fathers: The Journey of the Eastern European Jews to America and the Life They Found and Made (1976). There were smaller but steady streams of \\"Old immigration\\" sources in Ireland, Britain and Germany. The residents of Little Germany, in what is now the East Village, dispersed to more affluent neighborhoods and were replaced by growing numbers of poor immigrants on the Lower East Side.Dorothee Schneider, Trade Unions and Community: The German Working Class in New York City, 1870‚Äì1900 (1994) In 1850 about a third of the 50,000 American Jews lived in New York; they spoke German (not Yiddish), were active in Reform congregations, and took major leadership roles in the city's banking financial, merchandising, and clothing industries. An entirely different group of 1.4 million poor Yiddish-speaking Jews from Russia and Eastern Europe fled pogroms and anti-Semitism between 1880 and 1914. Over one million lived in New York, where by 1910 they comprised a fourth of the city's population. Many became entrepreneurs setting up small shops; the majority operated sewing machines and worked in the city's many small clothing factories.Jackson, Encyclopedia of New York City, (1996) pp 620‚Äì621 Violent confrontations between ethnic groups were strikingly common. Local ethnic gangs controlled their neighborhood turfs and beat up boys who wandered across the line. Each ethnic group had violent youth gangs; Irish gangs were especially aggressive. One serious episode took place in 1902, when the procession of 25,000 to 50,000 Jews marching for the funeral of Jacob Joseph, the chief rabbi of the Orthodox community, passed the Hoe factory. They were attacked by workers or boys throwing debris from the factory windows. The Jews fought back and quickly had the factory and its 1,800 men and boys under siege, breaking all its windows. The (mostly Irish) police broke it up and beat many of the men attacking the factory. They arrested 11 of the Jews and 4 of the factory workers. Jewish oral tradition blamed the anti-Semitism of both the Irish factory workers and the police. However, recent historical research shows that the factory workers were mostly Germans, not Irish, and that the police were following standard practice in quelling a riot. On the whole, the police kept a tight lid on inter-group violence.Edward T. O'Donnell, \\"Hibernians Versus Hebrews? A New Look at the 1902 Jacob Joseph Funeral Riot,\\" Journal of the Gilded Age & Progressive Era (2007) 6#2 pp 209‚Äì225. = Education = 1932 school, Turtle Bay Progressive Era reformers strongly promoted free public schooling through high school, on the assumption that ignorance was a waste and that learning developed the personality as well as skills needed in a modernizing society. Public school enrollment rose from 553,000 in 1900, to 1.1 million in 1930, and then declined a bit. The wide range of schools included elementary, junior high schools, as well as comprehensive, academic, and technical senior high schools. In addition, the system operated training schools in music the arts, science, cooking, the needle trades, printing, and the like, with special schools for handicapped children and a large evening program for adults.Cremin, American Education: The Metropolitan Experience 1876‚Äì1980 (1988) p 577 The availability of free public education through high school was especially attractive to poor Jewish immigrants who placed a high value on human capital. The city's other ethnic groups, most notably the Italians, typically placed a much higher value on home ownership, which required boys and girls to start earning money by age 14 or so.Thomas Kessner, The Golden Door: Italian and Jewish Immigrant Mobility in New York City 1880‚Äì1915 (1977)Miriam Cohen, \\"Changing education strategies among immigrant generations: New York Italians in comparative perspective.\\" Journal of Social History (1982): 443‚Äì466. in JSTOR In the Italian community, girls left school as soon as possible to work at home or to take factory jobs. The shift came in the 1930s, as more of them stayed in school, although at only half the rate of Jewish girls. Some historians argue that the Italians were becoming modernized by American culture; their families became less patriarchal and permitted more individualistic careerism for women. Historian Miriam Cohen, however, says that these more modern attitudes were caused by changing opportunities for all young women in New York.Ileen A. DeVault, \\"Workshop to Office: Two Generations of Italian Women in New York City, 1900‚Äì1950,\\" Reviews in American History (1994) 22#4 pp 620‚Äì625. Catholic priests strongly recommended parochial schools at least for elementary students and were rapidly expanding the Catholic high school system, especially for German and Irish youth whose families had been in the city for decades. The Catholic school system grew from an enrollment of 79,000 in 1900, to 286,000 in 1930, peaking at 332,000 in 1960. Upscale private schools also flourished, as well as training schools for adults, such as the Arthur Murray School of Dancing and many music schools. Tens of thousands of adults took correspondence courses through the mail.Cremin, American Education: The Metropolitan Experience 1876‚Äì1980 (1988) pp 579‚Äì581 Jewish boys and young men thrived in the New York public schools. The problem came with girls attending high school. Jewish men still had doubts about educating girls, and poor families needed the money they could earn in full-time jobs. Those who came to America as young girls picked up English quickly, but the older they were on arrival, the harder the language appeared. Many young Jewish women nevertheless tried, opening their way to clerical and white-collar jobs. Probably most saw their dreams realized in their children rather than themselves.Sydney Stahl Weinberg, \\"Longing To Learn: The Education of Jewish Immigrant Women in New York City, 1900‚Äì1934,\\" Journal of American Ethnic History (1989) 8#2 pp 108‚Äì126.  Higher education  Low Library at Columbia University, ca. 1900 Columbia University developed an international reputation as a major research center in a wide range of the arts, sciences, humanities, and medical fields. New York University in 1890 was still primarily an undergraduate school with a strong Protestant flavor. However it began adding graduate programs, a law school and a medical school, as well as a graduate school of education and a business school. It became one of the nation's largest universities, with an enrollment of 9,300 in 1917 and 40,000 in 1931.Jackson, Encyclopedia of New York City, (1996) pp 848‚Äì849 Fordham University took the lead among the Catholic colleges, adding a medical school, a law school, a business school, and other units. Its football team had a national reputation. Fordham became coeducational in 1964.Jackson, Encyclopedia of New York City, (1996) p 426 In addition there were many smaller specialized schools such as Wagner College (Lutheran), Yeshiva University (Jewish), St. John's University (Catholic), Pratt Institute, Juilliard School of Music, Parsons School of Design, Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute, and The New School for Social Research. There were numerous medical and law schools.Cremin, American Education: The Metropolitan Experience 1876‚Äì1980 (1988) p 581 The city's Protestant elites sent their young men to university-preparatory schools in New England and then to Ivy League colleges, and their young women to the Seven Sisters colleges or to finishing schools. After 1900, Columbia had a reputation as heavily academic and was no longer attractive to upper-class young men.Frederic Copler Jaher, The Urban Establishment: Upper Strata in Boston, New York, Charleston, Chicago, and Los Angeles (1982) p 266‚Äì267 Jewish enrollment reached 40% at Columbia College in 1914; a quota system was installed to cut the proportion to 20%. The public universities, City College and Hunter College, were about 80% Jewish.Harold S. Wechsler, \\"The Rationale for Restriction: Ethnicity and College Admission in America, 1910‚Äì1980,\\" American Quarterly (1984) 36#5 pp. 643‚Äì667 in JSTOR = Journalism = By the turn of the 20th century, the city had 15 to 20 daily newspapers, and many weeklies. Most newspapers were sold at newsstands or hawked by newsboys, as opposed to subscriptions. The Wall Street Journal provided detailed coverage of business affairs. The New York Times had shrunk to almost nothing by the 1890s. However, after its purchase by Adolph Ochs of Knoxville, Tennessee, in 1896, it reached an upscale audience with unbiased and detailed news. There were numerous ethnic papers.for a list of these see Jackson, Encyclopedia of New York City, (1996) pp. 819‚Äì820George E. Pozzetta, \\"The Italian Immigrant Press of New York City: The Early Years, 1880‚Äì1915.\\" Journal of Ethnic Studies (1973) 1#3 pp: 33‚Äì47. The ethnic papers played a major role in keeping immigrants in touch with the old country. More important, they taught them how to become Americans and understand the complexity of American popular culture.Peter Conolly-Smith, Translating America: An Immigrant Press Visualizes American Popular Culture, 1895‚Äì1918 (2004) Starting in 1895, William Randolph Hearst, a mining heir from San Francisco, challenged Joseph Pulitzer, from St. Louis, Missouri, for dominance on the newsstands. Both Hearst's Journal and Pulitzer's World favored the Democrats, and both sought to maximize their sales through yellow journalism with exclusives based on sensationalism, sports, sex and scandal, and features such as comic strips, puzzles, recipes, and advice columns. By 1898, both papers reached the million per day circulation level.W. Joseph Campbell, Yellow Journalism: Puncturing the Myths, Defining the Legacies (2001). Hearst became a leader of the left wing of the Democratic Party and was nearly elected mayor in 1905 and governor in 1906. He had bitter battles with Al Smith over control of the Democratic Party, losing out in 1925. He then moved his base to California. After enthusiastically supporting Franklin Roosevelt for president in 1932, he broke with Franklin D. Roosevelt, moved to the right, and became a critic of the New Deal, using his national magazines and New York Journal to confront Roosevelt's agenda.David Nasaw, The Chief: The Life of William Randolph Hearst (2013). = Disasters = The 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire On June 15, 1904, over 1,000 people, mostly German ethnics, were killed when the excursion steamship General Slocum caught fire and burned in the East River. It was a major blow to the German-American community. On March 25, 1911, the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire in Greenwich Village took the lives of 145 mostly Italian and Jewish female garment workers, which eventually led to great advancements in the city's fire department, building codes, and workplace regulations.David von Drehle, Triangle: The Fire That Changed America (2004) Reaction to the disaster spurred the growth of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union, and took place in the context of broader union movements coordinated by the American Federation of Labor.Jackson, Encyclopedia of New York City, (1996) pp 646‚Äì649 On the night of April 14‚Äì15, 1912, the ocean liner RMS Titanic was en route in the North Atlantic to New York when it sank, killing 1,500 of the 2,200 people. On April 18 the rescue ship RMS Carpathia arrived and was met by some 40,000 onlookers. Immediate relief in the form of clothing and transportation to shelters was provided by the Women's Relief Committee, the Travelers Aid Society of New York, and the Council of Jewish Women, among other organizations. Two Titanic memorials are located in Manhattan. On April 13, 1913, the Titanic Memorial Lighthouse in Lower Manhattan was constructed on the roof of the Seamen's Church Institute. Straus Park, on the Upper West Side, commemorates Isidor Straus and his wife Ida, who both died in the disaster. The Malbone Street Wreck, the worst disaster in the history of any rapid transit system in the United States, occurred on November 1, 1918. Many unionized subway workers went on strike against the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT), so the BRT assigned one of its office workers to be motorman on one train. This particular motorman had almost no training, instead of the usual 20 days minimum of training, and was recovering from the 1918 flu pandemic, which had just killed his daughter. During the rush hour, he made a series of bad mistakes, lost control on a downhill slope, and was racing at high speed when he crashed at a sharp curve outside of Prospect Park station. The Malbone Street Wreck killed 93 of the 650 passengers and seriously injured over hundred more. With a statewide election impending, it became a major campaign episode, leading to the election of Al Smith as governor.Slayton, Empire Statesman (2001) pp 119‚Äì120.Brian Cudahy, The Malbone Street Wreck (Fordham University Press, 1999) On September 16, 1920, radicals in the city perpetrated the Wall Street bombing, a terrorist attack outside the headquarters of the House of Morgan, killing dozens of people and injuring hundreds. Officials blamed anarchist and communist elements, fueling the ongoing Palmer raids, but the culprits were never caught.Beverly Gage, The Day Wall Street Exploded: A Story of America in Its First Age of Terror (2009) = Public health and sanitation = Cleanliness was a heavily promoted virtue, supported by the middle class and led by the public health community of physicians and experts.John Duffy, A History of Public Health in New York City, 1866‚Äì1966 (1974). Street cleaning became a major item of the city budget and produced the sort of jobs that the machines wanted to distribute to their working class clientele.Daniel Eli Burnstein, Next to Godliness: Confronting Dirt and Despair in Progressive Era New York City (2006) Horses were used for transportation in 1900, as they had been throughout the history of the city. There were 200,000 of them in the city, producing nearly of manure daily. It accumulated in the streets and was swept to the sides like snow. The stench was so strong that urbanites welcomed motor vehicles as a profound relief. The city took the lead internationally to combat diphtheria, an often fatal disease that struck thousands of children annually. Researchers applied laboratory-based advances in bacteriology and immunology to the treatment and prevention of this disease, thereby eradicating it as a major threat.Evelynn Maxine Hammonds, Childhood's Deadly Scourge: The Campaign to Control Diphtheria in New York City, 1880‚Äì1930 (1999) A few tens of thousands of people died in the \\"Spanish flu\\" epidemic of 1918‚Äì1919. =Gambling= At the turn-of-the-century in 1900, gambling was illegal but widespread in New York City. The favorite activities included games of chance such as cards, dice and numbers, and betting on sports events, chiefly horse racing. In the upper class, gambling was handled discreetly in the expensive private clubs, the most famous of which was operated by Richard Canfield who operated the Saratoga Club. Prominent players included Reggie Vanderbilt and John Bet-a- Million Gates.Lloyd Wendt and Herman Kogan, Bet a million! The story of John W. Gates (1946) online The chief competitor to Canfield was the \\"Bronze Door,\\" operated 1891-1917 by syndicate of gamblers closely linked to the Democratic machine represented by Tammany Hall. These elite establishments were illegal, and paid off the police and politicians as needed. The working-class was served by hundreds of neighborhood gambling parlors, featuring faro card games, and the omnipresent policy shops where poor folks could bet a few pennies on the daily numbers, and be quickly paid off so they could gamble again. Betting on horse racing was allowed only at the tracks themselves, where the controls were tight. The most famous racing venue was Belmont Park, a complex of five race courses, a 12,000 seat grandstand and multiple stables, centered around a lavish clubhouse. Middle-class gamblers could frequent the city's race tracks, but the center of middle-class moral gravity was strongly opposed to all forms of gambling. The reform movement was strongest in the 1890s. It was led by men such as the Reverend Charles H. Parkhurst, the leading Presbyterian pastor and president of the New York Society for the Prevention of Crime;Warren Sloat, A Battle for the Soul of New York: Tammany Hall, Police Corruption, Vice and Reverend Charles Parkhurst's Crusade Against Them,1892-1895 (2002) review reform mayor William L. Strong, and his police commissioner Theodore Roosevelt. Reformers passed laws in the state legislature against any emerging gambling venue. Such laws were enforced and most of the small towns and rural areas, but not in New York's larger cities, where political machines controlled the police and the courts.Mike Wallace, Greater Gotham: A history of New York City from 1898 to 1919 (Oxford U, 2017), pp 615-618 1920s to 1945 =Politics= Al Smith, leader of the Democrats in the 1910s and 1920s The Democrats, under the leadership of Al Smith and Robert F. Wagner embraced reform in the 1910s and 1920s, especially to the benefit of their core constituency, the working class.Robert A. Slayton, Empire statesman: The rise and redemption of Al Smith (2001) Smith became governor in the 1920s but lost the presidential election in 1928, even though he did very well in Catholic strongholds. Wagner served in the United States Senate from 1927 to 1949, where he was a leader of the New Deal Coalition, paying special emphasis to supporting the labor movement.J. Joseph Huthmacher, \\"Senator Robert F. Wagner and the rise of urban liberalism.\\" American Jewish Historical Quarterly (1969): pp 330‚Äì346. in JSTOR The 1924 presidential election, in which most New Yorkers voted for Calvin Coolidge, was the last time New York City was ever won by a Republican presidential candidate. After 1928, scandal engulfed City Hall. Flamboyant Mayor Jimmy Walker resigned and fled to Europe after state investigations showed he had taken bribes. Coupled with the harshness of the Great Depression, this gave an opening to the reformers. They won in 1933 with a Fusion ticket headed by Fiorello La Guardia.Arthur Mann, La Guardia comes to power: 1933 (1965). He was a liberal Republican Congressman with strong Italian and Jewish connections who appealed across party lines. La Guardia dominated city politics as mayor, 1934 to 1945. He supported President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal; in turn Roosevelt heavily funded the city and cut off patronage for La Guardia's enemies.Mason B. Williams, City of Ambition: FDR, La Guardia, and the Making of Modern New York (2013) La Guardia revitalized New York and restored public faith in City Hall. With the help of Robert Moses he directed the building of low-cost public housing, public playgrounds, parks, and airports. He reorganized the police force, defeated the still-powerful Tammany Hall machine, and reestablished the merit system in place of patronage jobs. La Guardia was a domineering leader who verged on authoritarianism but whose reform politics were carefully tailored to address the sentiments of his diverse constituency. He defeated a corrupt Democratic machine, presided during the Depression and world war, made the city the model for New Deal welfare and public works programs, and championed immigrants and ethnic minorities. He succeeded with the support of a sympathetic president who was equally hostile to Tammany Hall. He secured his place in history as a tough- minded reform mayor who helped clean out corruption, bring in gifted experts, and fix upon the city a broad sense of responsibility for its own citizens. His administration engaged new groups that had been kept out of the political system, gave New York its modern infrastructure, and raised expectations of new levels of urban possibility.H. Paul Jeffers, The Napoleon of New York: Mayor Fiorello La Guardia (2007) =Ethnics come of age= Immigrant families continued establishing themselves, and more started moving into the neighborhoods outside of Manhattan; in a sign of municipal maturation, the 1920 census showed Brooklyn for the first time overtaking Manhattan as the most populous borough. But the great period of European immigration which had only just passed its peak was halted abruptly by the Immigration Act of 1924 which severely limited further immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe. Harlem Renaissance After 1890, black people started moving into the formerly Jewish neighborhood of Harlem on Manhattan's upper West side. Much larger numbers arrived during the era of World War I as the Great Migration brought in blacks to fill more jobs at a time when immigration was suspended.Gilbert Osofsky, Harlem: The Making of a Ghetto: Negro New York, 1890‚Äì1930 (1971). Harlem became the political capital of black America, with highly controversial leadership from Marcus Garvey in the early 1920s.Joanne Reitano, \\"Moving Minds and Mountains: African Americans in New York City from 1919 to 1945,\\" Afro-Americans in New York Life & History (2010) 34#1 pp 118‚Äì134. Sustained civil rights activism took place in the 1930s and 1940s, often led by Baptists minister Adam Clayton Powell, Jr., who was elected to the United States Congress in 1942.Charles V. Hamilton, Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.: The Political Biography of an American Dilemma (1991) Unemployment was a major problem in the Depression years, but New Deal relief agencies such as the Civilian Conservation Corps and Works Progress Administration provided considerable employment on an equal basis. Much of the organize protest was a demand for jobs and stores owned and operated by whites in Harlem.Cheryl Lynn Greenberg, \\"Or Does It Explode?\\": Black Harlem in the Great Depression' (1991). The Harlem Renaissance from 1920 to 1940 brought worldwide attention to African American literature. For many years, especially in the 1920s, Harlem was home to a flourishing of social thought and culture that took place among numerous Black artists, musicians, novelists, poets, and playwrights. The most famous writers included Langston Hughes, James Weldon Johnson, Claude McKay, and Zora Neale Hurston.Nathan Irvin Huggins, Harlem renaissance (Oxford University Press, 2007). =Jazz Age= Louis Armstrong The Jazz Age featured celebrities, among the most notable in the city were Madame Polly Adler; jazz singer Ella Fitzgerald; dancer Martha Graham; speakeasy host Texas Guinan; publisher Henry Luce of Time magazine; writer Dorothy Parker and the pundits at the Algonquin Hotel; editor Harold Ross at The New Yorker magazine; and such nationally famous sports heroes as Babe Ruth and Bill Tilden.Wagner, David, Capital of the World: A Portrait of New York City in the Roaring Twenties (2011) Fun-loving Tammany Mayor Jimmy Walker presided over a period of prosperity for the city, with the proliferation of the speakeasy during Prohibition. Tin Pan Alley developed toward Broadway, and the first modern musical, Jerome Kern's Show Boat, opened in 1927, as the theater district moved north of 42nd Street. A workman helps raise the Empire State Building 25 floors higher than the Chrysler Building (at right), as seen in 1931. During this time, New York City became known for its daring and impressive architecture, including notably the skyscrapers which transformed the skyline. The race to the sky culminated in the dueling spires of two Art Deco icons‚Äîthe Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building‚Äîduring the late 1920s. These two skyscrapers were not topped off until their soaring heights seemed rather overoptimistic. The construction of the Rockefeller Center also occurred during this time, becoming one of the largest-ever private development projects at the time. The city grew outward, too, with residential development replacing most of the farmland of eastern Brooklyn, eastern Bronx, and much of Queens. = Great Depression = Stock Market Crash The Great Depression, which was to affect the rest of the world, began with the Stock Market Crash of 1929. The recently completed Empire State Building would be known as the \\"Empty State Building\\" for many years because it could not attract sufficient tenants in the bleak business climate. When New York Governor Franklin Roosevelt became president, the Hooverville shacks named after his predecessor dotted city parks. The city became a showcase for New Deal spending, especially through the Public Works Administration and the Works Progress Administration. There were massive building projects including highways, bridges, public housing, new schools, and expansion of the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Robert Moses with a model of his proposed Battery Bridge, never built Parkway planner Robert Moses took charge of building many bridges, parks, public housing units, and parkways with mainly federal money. Moses was a great proponent of automobile-centered modernism whose legacy of massive construction projects is still controversial.Pierre Christin and Olivier Balez, Robert Moses: The Master Builder of New York City (2014)Kenneth T. Jackson, and Hillary Ballon, eds. Robert Moses and the Modern City: The Transformation of New York (2007) He opposed the massive subway expansions proposed in 1929 and 1939. However, the last large expansion of the subway system, combined with the merger of privately owned Interborough Rapid Transit and Brooklyn‚ÄìManhattan Transit subway companies with the city-owned Independent Subway System under city ownership, made the subway largely what it is today. =World War II= Aircraft engine at Naval Training School in the Bronx New York, long a great American city with many immigrants, became a culturally international city with the brain drain of intellectual, musical, and artistic European refugees that started in the late 1930s. The 1939 New York World's Fair, marking the 150th anniversary of George Washington's inauguration in Federal Hall, was a high point of technological optimism, meant to mark the end of the Depression. After the start of World War II, though, the theme was changed from \\"Building the World of Tomorrow\\" to \\"For Peace and Freedom\\", and the shadow of the war underway in Europe dampened the proceedings.Larry Zim, Mel Lerner, and Herbert Rolfes, The world of tomorrow: the 1939 New York World's Fair (1988). The economy of New York City was boosted by the war effort, but not to the extent of cities with heavy industries such as Pittsburgh, Chicago, Los Angeles or Detroit. The clothing industry produced uniforms, and machine shops focused on war materials. The Brooklyn Navy Yard again increased its production of warships. The large printing industry was scarcely affected. The port facilities again played their role in shipping supplies and soldiers to Europe. The Port of New York handled 25% of the nation's exports. By the war's end, the Navy Yard was the world's largest shipyard with 75,000 workers. When peace arrived in 1945, New York was clearly pre-eminent in the world, as the only major world city unscathed by the war. Economy = Finance = New York became the financial center of the United States before the Civil War, specializing in railroad securities. By 1900 it grew even more dominant and was starting to approach London as a world financial center.Charles R. Morris, The Tycoons: How Andrew Carnegie, John D. Rockefeller, Jay Gould, and JP Morgan Invented the American Supereconomy (2005)Sven Beckert, The Monied Metropolis: New York City and the Consolidation of the American Bourgeoisie, 1850‚Äì1896 (2003). There were thousands of successful bankers and financiers; a central figure was J.P. Morgan, whose House of Morgan set up national financing programs for the steel, agricultural implements, shipping, and other industries. It also financed much of the British and French war efforts in World War I.Ron Chernow, The House of Morgan: An American Banking Dynasty and the Rise of Modern Finance (2001). John D. Rockefeller, of Standard Oil, expanded from a dominant position in oil to other industries as well as banking. Andrew Carnegie dominated steel until he sold out to Morgan in 1901. After 1900, Rockefeller and Carnegie largely devoted their interest to philanthropy, as to a certain extent did Morgan. With the creation of the Federal Reserve System in 1913, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York became a powerful player under its dynamic president Benjamin Strong.Lester V. Chandler, Benjamin Strong: Central Banker (1958) By 1917, New York was funding the world war efforts of Britain, France and for other Allies. By the 1920s, New York had surpassed London as a world banking center. The New York Stock Exchange was the national focus of wealth making and speculation until its shares suddenly collapsed late in 1929, setting off the worldwide Great Depression.Charles R. Geisst, Wall Street: A History (2nd ed. 2012) =Garment industry= The garment industry involved the manufacture of ready-to-wear clothing for men and women, as well as the wholesaling of these products to stores around the country. New York City dominated the national industry, with Chicago and Los Angeles trailing far behind. It originated in the nineteenth-century \\"rag trade\\" of Jewish tailors, cutters, pressers, peddlers, and shopkeepers. By 1900 it was a largely Jewish owned and operated industry, and most workers were Jewish, although other new immigrants were being hired.Gabriel Goldstein and Elizabeth Greenberg. A Perfect Fit: The Garment Industry and American Jewry, 1860‚Äì1960 (2012) The Yiddish-speaking East European Jews were strong supporters of labor unions, which they related to their socialist influences back in Europe. The International Ladies Garment Workers Union (ILGWU) formed in 1900 and was a major player in the American Federation of Labor. It grew rapidly in its first two decades and took credit for abolishing sewing work in the tenements, establishing a six-day, 54-hour week, writing union contracts that gave preference to ILGWU members applying for a job, and setting up arbitration machinery. The union was much larger and stronger than the hundreds of small shops with which it dealt. However, in the 1920s the ILGWU was ripped apart by battles between the established leadership, the Communists. By 1928 the establishment won out; the Communists only controlled the Furriers union, which they ruled by paramilitary violence.Howe, World of Our Fathers, pp 330‚Äì341 ILGWU membership had dropped to 40,000 (the great majority of whom were women). The early years of the Great Depression further undermined the union. Under the leadership of David Dubinsky, the ILGWU became a major supporter of Roosevelt's New Deal, and it grew rapidly in membership in the late 1930s and during World War II.Robert Parment, The Master of Seventh Avenue: David Dubinsky and the American Labor Movement (2005) The Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America was a more radical breakaway group that formed in 1914. It focused on ready-made clothing for men, and provided banks, recreation, medical care, and even restaurants and housing for the membership. It expelled its Communists in the 1920s. Under the leadership of Sidney Hillman, it played a central role in forming the militant Congress of Industrial Organizations in the mid-1930s, and giving Hillman a powerful voice in the New Deal Coalition.Steven Fraser, Labor Will Rule: Sidney Hillman and the Rise of American Labor (1991) After 1970, both unions lost membership and merged in 1995. With the Democratic Party in the city largely controlled by the conservative Irish, Dubinsky and Hillman and their unions formed a new political party in 1936, the American Labor Party. It ran a ticket only in New York State, where it enthusiastically endorsed Roosevelt's three re-elections. When the Communists infiltrated the Party in 1944, the ILGWU broke away and formed the Liberal Party of New York. The Liberal party was led for many years by Alex Rose, the leader of the hatter's union, a small garment industry union. =On the waterfront= NASA image of the Port of New York and New Jersey The Port of New York and New Jersey was the largest American port by far, serving both passenger and merchant vessels. The port was the main point of embarkation for U.S. troops traveling to Europe during World War I. The congestion at the port led experts to realize the need for a port authority to supervise the extremely complex system of bridges, highways, subways, and port facilities in the New York-New Jersey area. The Port of New York Authority was created in 1921, under the supervision of the governors of New York and New Jersey. By issuing its own bonds, it was financially independent of either state; the bonds were paid off from tolls and fees, and not from taxes. It became one of the major agencies of the New York metropolitan area to handle large-scale projects, especially under the leadership of Austin Tobin. Passenger ships flourished before the coming of transatlantic air carriers in the 1960s. One line of business catered to upscale tourists headed in both directions, with American and British lines in competition. Passenger steamships also carried steerage passengers at low rates. The vast majority were immigrants to the United States, although some immigrants were returning to Europe. Two German companies dominated the immigration traffic to New York from Central and Eastern Europe, the Hamburg-America line and the North German Lloyd. They built elaborate networks of ticket agencies in Europe, offering low-cost one-way packages. Immigrants headed to other cities typically held prepaid tickets paid by their relatives who had already established themselves in the New World. Most new arrivals already had some idea of what they were coming to, from family letters and widely available pamphlet literature.Torsten Feys, \\"Where All Passenger Liners Meet: New York as a Nodal Point for the Transatlantic Migrant Trade, 1885‚Äì1895,\\" International Journal of Maritime History (2007) 19#2 pp 245‚Äì272. The great majority of travelers from Europe came through New York City, and the immigrants did their paperwork at Ellis Island. A small percentage were rejected because of obvious disease; the steamship companies had to pay their fair back, so they screened for sick passengers ahead of time in Europe.Nancy Foner, From Ellis Island to JFK: New York's two great waves of immigration (2000). =World War I= The city played a major role in publicizing and financing World War I, as well as producing uniforms and warships. There was fear of German sabotage, especially in the aftermath of the Black Tom explosion in 1916.Jules Witcover, Sabotage at Black Tom: Imperial Germany's Secret in America, 1914‚Äì1917 (1989). The Bronx Grand Concourse and 161st Street at the beginning of the 20th century. The Bronx's history after 1898 falls into several distinct periods.Lloyd Ultan, The Northern Borough: A History of The Bronx (2011) The first is a boom period during 1898‚Äì1929, with a population growth by a factor of six from 200,000 in 1900 to 1.3 million in 1930. The Great Depression brought a surge of unemployment, especially among the working class, and a slowing of growth. The mid-to-late century were hard times, as the Bronx declined in the 1950s through the '70s from a predominantly moderate-income to a predominantly lower-income area with high rates of violent crime and poverty. An economic and developmental resurgence began in the late 1980s and continued through the 1990s.Robert A. Olmsted, \\"A History of Transportation in the Bronx\\", Bronx County Historical Society Journal (1989) 26#2 pp: 68‚Äì91Olmsted, Robert A. \\"Transportation Made the Bronx\\", Bronx County Historical Society Journal (1998) 35#2 pp: 166‚Äì180 Politics in the borough from 1922 to 1953 was under the tight control of the Democratic organization, with Edward J. Flynn at the helm. Generally referred to as \\"the boss\\", he ran the political machine like a business executive, paying particular attention to choosing top lieutenants, and providing services to grateful voters. In sharp contrast to the leaders of Tammany, he cooperated very smoothly with Franklin Roosevelt both as governor and as president.Edward J. Flynn, You're the Boss (1947), His autobiography.

This tanager is a resident breeder in Costa Rica, Panama, South America south to Ecuador, Bolivia and southern Brazil, and on Trinidad. Taxonomy The bay- headed tanager was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae under the binomial name Fringilla gyrola. The specific epithet is a diminutive of the Latin gyrus meaning \\"ring\\". Linnaeus based his own description on the \\"red-headed green- finch\\" described and illustrated by the English naturalist George Edwards in 1743 in his A Natural History of Uncommon Birds. The type locality is Suriname. The bay-headed tanager is now placed in the genus Tangara that was introduced by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760. Nine subspecies are recognised: * T. g. bangsi (Hellmayr, 1911) ‚Äì Nicaragua to west Panama * T. g. deleticia (Bangs, 1908) ‚Äì east Panama to central, wwest Colombia * T. g. nupera Bangs, 1917 ‚Äì southwest Colombia, west Ecuador and northwest Peru * T. g. toddi Bangs & Penard, TE, 1921 ‚Äì north Colombia and northwest, north Venezuela * T. g. viridissima (Lafresnaye, 1847) ‚Äì northeast Venezuela and Trinidad * T. g. catharinae (Hellmayr, 1911) ‚Äì central Colombia through east Ecuador and east Peru to west, central Bolivia * T. g. parva Zimmer, JT, 1943 ‚Äì east Colombia, south Venezuela, northeast Peru and northwest Brazil * T. g. gyrola (Linnaeus, 1758) ‚Äì southeast Venezuela, the Guianas and north Brazil * T. g. albertinae (Pelzeln, 1877) ‚Äì central Brazil south of Amazon Description Adult bay-headed tanagers are 14 cm long and weigh 19.5 g. The nominate race T. g. gyrola is mainly green apart from a chestnut head, a blue or green belly, and a thin gold collar on the hind neck. Sexes are similar, but immatures are duller with chestnut-flecked green heads. There is considerable plumage variation between the various subspecies, and T. g.viridissima of northeast Venezuela and Trinidad has green underparts concolorous with the rest of the body plumage. The bay-headed tanager's song is a slow seee, seee, seee, tsou, tsooy. Distribution and habitat It occurs in forests, particularly in wetter areas. The bulky cup nest is built in a tree and the normal clutch is two brown-blotched white eggs. The female incubates the eggs for 13‚Äì14 days to hatching, with another 15‚Äì16 days before the chicks fledge. . Behavior and ecology These are social birds which eat mainly fruit, usually swallowed whole. Insects are also taken, mainly from the underside of branches.

The Fall concert has been named Fall Tonic since 1980, while the spring concert (produced since 1993) is known as Happy Hour. Performances and tours take place around campus, around the country, and around the world. These efforts are undertaken in addition to the performances and travels that Hangovers members are also involved in as members of the Glee Club (see above). The Hangovers' first solo tour was to Bermuda in 1971, with subsequent tours undertaken to Antigua, Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Spain, and Switzerland.The Hangovers' tour log at hangovers.com, chronicling recent European tours The ensemble also records periodically, and has released thirteen albums. = Earlier subset history = Prior to The Hangovers, the Glee Club spawned several spinoff a cappella subsets in the second half of the 20th century as collegiate a cappella emerged as a popular form of music. *Cayuga's Waiters (1949‚Äì1956) **disassociated from Glee Club in 1956; existed independently through 2017 *The Sherwoods (1956‚Äì1958) **removed from Glee Club in 1958; existed independently through 1973 **alumni often perform during Cornell Reunions weekend *Glee Club Eight / Glee Club Octaves (1958‚Äì1966) *The Hangovers (1968‚Äìpresent) **continue to tour and perform within the CUGC and separately as the official a cappella subset *Leftovers (1971‚Äì1972) **merged with The Hangovers in 1972  The Sherwoods  First appearing at the Glee Club's 1956 fall concert, The Sherwoods of Cornell gained prominence quickly among collegiate musical groups. They took their name from Sherwood B. \\"Woody\\" Bliss, Cornell class of 1958. They embarked on their first international tour in the summer of 1957 (with an itinerary including Hawaii and the Far East) and by 1958, they were a successful act in great demand both on and off campus.:242 This enormous success came at a price, however, and led to conflicts with the Glee Club, which had nominally remained The Sherwoods' parent organization during these formative years. In the fall of 1958, the two organizations split officially. Glee Club director Thomas Sokol later recalled that The Sherwoods had been \\"twelve of [his] best singers,\\" and that losing them was a difficult‚Äîbut necessary‚Äîstep for both organizations.:242 The Sherwoods toured extensively, traveling to Hawaii, the Far East, Bermuda, the Virgin Islands, and Jamaica and on two extensive tours for the USO, entertaining troops in the Philippines, and throughout Germany (1964). They commonly wore dark (Sherwood) green jackets and ties for performances. Rather than sing stock arrangements, The Sherwoods wrote their own. They were known for rich 6‚Äì8 part harmony music unique among other a cappella groups of their time. Four members accounted for most of their arrangements: Jack Wade '58, Frank Holden '62, Fred Kewley '65, and Dan Murray '70 whose arrangements are numerous on the final Sherwood LP, \\"Green\\" (1971). Holden (resident of Duxbury, MA) and Kewley (a manager of music professionals in Nashville, TN) are now both music directors for two large groups of alumni Sherwoods they call \\"The Founders\\" (singers from classes of '58‚Äì'63) and \\"The Youngers\\" (singers from classes of '64‚Äì'74). Kewley succumbed to pancreatic cancer on June 23, 2013. Eighteen of his Sherwoods traveled to Nashville, TN to join family and friends in a memorial service to honor him. Taking Kewley's place as Sherwoods music director is David Hunter '68. Ron Johnson '68 continues on as business manager. The group intends to continue singing at Cornell's annual reunion each June, and elsewhere, upon demand. The popularity of a cappella singing faded for a period in the early 1970s and The Sherwoods stopped auditioning new members in 1973. 1973 also marked the final year in which the Sherwoods were featured in The Cornellian, Cornell University's annual year book.:242 In 1985 The Class of '65 invited the 'Younger' Sherwoods back to Cornell to entertain them at their 20th reunion. It was the first time in twenty years The Youngers had met to re-learn their songs and practice their entertaining introductions. The 'Younger' Sherwoods have been returning to Cornell's Ithaca campus to perform at reunions every year since 1985, celebrating their 26th annual shows in 2010, once again entertaining the Class of '65, this time at the class's 45th reunion.:242 The 'Founders' Sherwoods gather at various times during the year, continuing to practice and perform the repertoire they sang during their era at Cornell. Between the two Sherwoods groups there are about 45 active Sherwood singers performing today. The Sherwoods released seven albums during their undergraduate years; more recently they have produced two re-mastered compilation CDs entitled \\"Try to Remember ‚Äì The Reunion Album\\" and \\"Old Friends\\". The Sherwoods continue to look for opportunities to perform. Business manager is Ron Johnson '68 of Hingham, MA. Noted hit singer/songwriter Harry Chapin sang with the Sherwoods for several years, writing two songs performed by the group, 'Let me Down Easy' and 'Winter Song'. As an undergraduate, Chapin was preoccupied with his prolific songwriting, and he eventually dropped out of Cornell University to focus on his early career as a successful singer-songwriter. In 1971 Fred Kewley, Sherwood musical director, became Chapin's manager through the best years of his career, from landing the recording contract with Elektra through his hits Taxi, WOLD, and Cats In The Cradle, etc., and the hundreds of concerts around the US and Europe his music spawned.

In natural uranium and in uranium ore, 234U occurs as an indirect decay product of uranium-238, but it makes up only 0.0055% (55 parts per million) of the raw uranium because its half-life of just 245,500 years is only about 1/18,000 as long as that of 238U. The primary path of production of 234U via nuclear decay is as follows: uranium-238 nuclei emit an alpha particle to become thorium-234. Next, with a short half-life, 234Th nuclei emit a beta particle to become protactinium-234 (234Pa), or more likely a nuclear isomer denoted 234mPa. Finally, 234Pa or 234mPa nuclei emit another beta particle to become 234U nuclei. Uranium-234 nuclei decay by alpha emission to thorium-230, except for the tiny fraction (parts per billion) of nuclei which undergo spontaneous fission. Extraction of rather small amounts of 234U from natural uranium would be feasible using isotope separation, similar to that used for regular uranium-enrichment. However, there is no real demand in chemistry, physics, or engineering for isolating 234U. Very small pure samples of 234U can be extracted via the chemical ion-exchange process - from samples of plutonium-238 that have been aged somewhat to allow some decay to 234U via alpha emission. Enriched uranium contains more 234U than natural uranium as a byproduct of the uranium enrichment process aimed at obtaining uranium-235, which concentrates lighter isotopes even more strongly than it does 235U. IAEA research paper TECDOC-1529 concludes the 234U content of enriched fuel is directly proportional to the degree of 235U‚Äîenrichment with 2% 235U resulting in 150 g 234U/tonHM, and the most common 4.5% 235U enrichment resulting in 400 g 234U/tonHM.https://www- pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/te_1529_web.pdf The increased percentage of 234U in enriched natural uranium is acceptable in current nuclear reactors. Recycled (re-enriched) reprocessed uranium contains even higher fractions of 234U. This is advantageous because while 234U is not fissile, it tends to absorb slow neutrons in a nuclear reactor breeding 235U. This is much more efficient than series of steps 238U + n ‚Üí 239Np ‚Üí 239Pu in replacing fissile isotope consumption. Uranium-234 has a neutron-capture cross section of about 100 barns for thermal neutrons, and about 700 barns for its resonance integral - the average of neutrons having a range of intermediate energies. In a nuclear reactor non-fissile isotopes 234U and 238U both capture a neutron breeding fissile isotopes 235U and 239Pu respectively. 234U is converted to 235U more easily and therefore at a greater rate than 238U is to 239Pu (via neptunium-239) because 238U has a much smaller neutron-capture cross section of just 2.7 barns. In the reaction 234U + n ‚Üí 235U reaction, the 234U content of 4.5% enriched fuel drops steadily over the irradiation period falling from 450g/ton HM to 205g/ton HM in fuel with an irradiation of 60GWd/ton HM.https://www.nuclear-power.net/wp- content/uploads/2015/06/uranium_234_irradiated_fuel.png Additionally, (n, 2n) reactions with fast neutrons also convert small amounts of 235U to 234U. This is countered by the rapid conversion of available 234U into 235U through thermal neutron capture. Spent fuel may contain as much as 0.010% 234U, or 100 parts per million, a much higher fraction than in natural uranium's 55 parts per million. Depleted uranium separated during the enrichment process contains much less 234U (around 0.001%WHO  Depleted uranium ) which makes the radioactivity of depleted uranium about one-half of that of natural uranium. Natural uranium has an \\"equilibrium\\" concentration of 234U‚Äîthe point at which an equal number of decays of 238U and 234U will occur.

Rice was Seattle's first, and to date only, elected African-American mayor (Bruce Harrell assumed the post of acting mayor on September 13, 2017). Early life Rice graduated from the University of Washington in Seattle, earning a bachelor's degree in communications and a Master of Public Administration from the university's Daniel J. Evans School of Public Affairs. He became a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. In 1975, he married Dr. Constance Williams. Before entering city government, Rice worked as a reporter at KOMO-TV News and KIXI radio. He served as Assistant Director of the Seattle Urban League. He next worked as Executive Assistant and Director of Government Services for the Puget Sound Council of Governments. Political life Rice was first elected to the Seattle City Council in 1978 to fill a vacancy. He was reelected in 1979, 1983 and 1987, serving eleven years in all. He served as chairs of the Energy, Finance, and Budget committees, and was Council President for one term. Rice facilitated the development of more equitable cost allocation and rate design procedures for Seattle City Light as part of his work on the Energy Committee. His accomplishments on the Finance and Budget Committee included the passage of the Women and Minority Business Enterprise Ordinance, and from 1982 to 1987, the elimination of City investments in firms doing business in apartheid-era South Africa. He ran for mayor in 1985, but lost to Charles Royer. Rice ran again in 1989 in a crowded field and won 99,699 to 75,446. He was re-elected in 1993. During the technology boom of the 1990s, Rice led the rejuvenation of Seattle's downtown. He also served as President of the U.S. Conference of Mayors. In 1995, Rice served as a committee member for the Rudy Bruner Award for Urban Excellence. In 1996, Rice ran in the Democratic primary for Governor of Washington, but he was defeated by then-King County Executive Gary Locke. In 1997, Rice made a guest appearance as himself on an episode of Frasier, entitled \\"The 1000th Show.\\" Civic life Rice at the University of Washington in November 2008 Rice was CEO and then president of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Seattle from 1998 to 2004. Norm Rice loaded the Seattle branch of the bank with billions of dollars of loans which put the Seattle branch in financial difficulty. He voluntarily stepped down in 2004. Rice is serving a three-year term as a Distinguished Practitioner-in-Residence at the University of Washington‚Äôs Daniel J. Evans School of Public Affairs and leads the project Civic Engagement in the 21st Century.

It took place in the Shanghai International Settlement which was under international control. Japanese army officers, defying higher authorities, had provoked anti-Japanese demonstrations in the international District of Shanghai. A Chinese mob attacked Japanese Buddhist priests, killing one. Heavy fighting broke out, and China appealed with no success to the League of Nations. A truce was finally reached on May 5, calling for Japanese military withdrawal, and an end to Chinese boycotts of Japanese products. Internationally, the episode intensified opposition to Japan's aggression in Asia. The episode helped undermine civilian rule in Tokyo; Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi was assassinated on May 15, 1932.Donald A. JordanChina's trial by fire: The Shanghai War of 1932 (University of Michigan Press, 2001). Naming In Chinese literature it is known as the January 28 incident (), while in Western sources it is often called the Shanghai War of 1932 or the Shanghai incident. In Japan it is known as the first Shanghai incident, alluding to the second Shanghai incident, which is the Japanese name for the Battle of Shanghai that occurred during the opening stages of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937. Background After the Mukden Incident, Japan had acquired control over Manchuria and would eventually establish the puppet government of Manchukuo. However, the Japanese military planned to increase Japanese influence further, especially into Shanghai where Japan, along with the various western powers, had extraterritorial rights. On January 18, five Japanese Buddhist monks, members of an ardently nationalist sect, were beaten near Shanghai's Sanyou Factory () by agitated Chinese civilians. Two were seriously injured, and one died.Edwin P. Hoyt, Japan's War, p 98 Over the next few hours, a group burnt down the factory. One policeman was killed and several more hurt when they arrived to quell the disorder. This caused an upsurge of anti-Japanese and anti-imperialist protests in the city and its concessions, with Chinese residents of Shanghai marching onto the streets and calling for a boycott of Japanese-made goods. Battle Chinese military police in combat Japanese troops burning residential districts The situation continued to deteriorate over the next week. By January 27, the Japanese military had already concentrated some 30 ships, 40 airplanes and nearly 7,000 troops around the shoreline of Shanghai to put down any resistance in the event that violence broke out. The military's justification was that it had to defend its concession and citizens. The Japanese issued an ultimatum to the Shanghai Municipal Council demanding public condemnation and monetary compensation by the Chinese for any Japanese property damaged in the monk incident, and demanding that the Chinese government take active steps to suppress further anti-Japanese protests in the city. During the afternoon of January 28, the Shanghai Municipal Council agreed to these demands. Throughout this period, the Chinese 19th Route Army had been massing outside the city, causing consternation to the civil Chinese administration of Shanghai and the foreign- run concessions. The 19th Route Army was generally viewed as little more than a warlord force, posing as great a danger to Shanghai as the Japanese military. In the end, Shanghai donated a substantial bribe to the 19th Route Army, hoping that it would leave and not incite a Japanese attack.JordanChina's trial by fire: The Shanghai War of 1932 (2001). However, at midnight on January 28, Japanese carrier aircraft bombed Shanghai in the first major aircraft carrier action in East Asia. Barbara W. Tuchman described this as also being \\"the first terror bombing of a civilian population of an era that was to become familiar with it\\", preceding the Condor Legion's bombing of Guernica by five years. Three thousand Japanese troops attacked targets, such as the Shanghai North railway station, around the city and began an invasion of the de facto Japanese settlement in Hongkew and other areas north of Suzhou Creek. In what was a surprising about-face for many, the 19th Route Army, which many had expected to leave after having been paid, put up fierce resistance. Though the opening battles took place in the Hongkew district of the International Settlement, the conflict soon spread outwards to much of Chinese-controlled Shanghai. The majority of the concessions remained untouched by the conflict, and it was often the case that those in the Shanghai International Settlement would watch the war from the banks of Suzhou Creek. They could even visit the battle lines by virtue of their extraterritoriality. On January 30, Chiang Kai-shek decided to temporarily relocate the capital from Nanjing to Luoyang as an emergency measure, due to the fact that Nanjing's proximity to Shanghai could make it a target.JordanChina's trial by fire: The Shanghai War of 1932 (2001). Because Shanghai was a metropolitan city with many foreign interests invested in it, other countries, such as the United States, the United Kingdom and France, attempted to negotiate a ceasefire between Japan and China. However, Japan refused, instead continuing to mobilize troops in the region. On February 12, American, British and French representatives brokered a half-day cease fire for humanitarian relief to civilians caught in the crossfire. The same day, the Japanese issued another ultimatum, demanding that the Chinese Army retreat 20 km from the border of the Shanghai concessions, a demand promptly rejected. This only intensified fighting in Hongkew. The Japanese were unable to take the city by the middle of February. Subsequently, the number of Japanese troops was increased to nearly 90,000 with the arrival of the 9th Infantry Division and the IJA 24th Mixed Brigade, supported by 80 warships and 300 airplanes. Map of the fighting in Shanghai On February 14, Chiang Kai-shek sent the 5th Army, including the 87th and 88th divisions, into Shanghai. On February 20, Japanese bombardments were increased to force the Chinese away from their defensive positions near Miaohang, while commercial and residential districts of the city were set on fire. The Chinese defensive positions deteriorated rapidly without naval and armored support, with the number of defenders dwindling to fewer than 50,000. Japanese forces increased to over a 100,000 troops, backed by aerial and naval bombardments. On February 28, after a week of fierce fighting characterized by the stubborn resistance of the Cantonese troops, the Japanese, supported by superior artillery, took the village of Kiangwan (now Jiangwanzhen), north of Shanghai.Canberra Times, 29 Feb 1932; http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article2268041 On February 29, the Japanese 11th Infantry Division landed near Liuhe behind Chinese lines. The defenders launched a desperate counterattack from 1 March, but were unable to dislodge the Japanese. On March 2, the 19th Route Army issued a telegram stating that it was necessary to withdraw from Shanghai due to lack of supplies and manpower. The next day, the 19th Route Army and the 5th Army retreated from Shanghai, marking the official end of the battle.JordanChina's trial by fire: The Shanghai War of 1932 (2001). Peace process Remembrance service for fallen Chinese troops On March 4, the League of Nations passed a resolution demanding a ceasefire, though sporadic fighting persisted. On March 6, the Chinese unilaterally agreed to stop fighting, although the Japanese rejected the ceasefire. On March 14, representatives from the League of Nations arrived at Shanghai to broker a negotiation with the Japanese. While negotiations were going on, intermittent fighting continued in both outlying areas and the city itself.JordanChina's trial by fire: The Shanghai War of 1932 (2001). On May 5, China and Japan signed the Shanghai Ceasefire Agreement (). The agreement made Shanghai a demilitarized zone and forbade China to garrison troops in areas surrounding Shanghai, Suzhou, and Kunshan, while allowing the presence of a few Japanese units in the city. China was allowed to keep only a small police force within the city. Aftermath After the ceasefire was brokered, the 19th Army was reassigned by Chiang Kai-shek to suppress the Chinese Communist insurrection in Fujian. After winning some battles against the communists, a peace agreement was negotiated. On November 22, the leadership of the 19th Route Army revolted against the Kuomintang government, and established the Fujian People's Government, independent of the Republic of China. This new government was not supported by all elements of the communists and was quickly crushed by Chiang's armies in January 1934. The leaders of the 19th Route Army escaped to Hong Kong, and the rest of the army was disbanded and reassigned to other units of the National Revolutionary Army. Yoshinori Shirakawa, the commander of the Shanghai Expeditionary Army and joint leader of the Japanese forces, was severely wounded by Korean nationalist Yoon Bong-Gil during a birthday celebration for Emperor Hirohito held at Shanghai's Hongkou Park and died of his injuries on May 26.

It is kinetically unstable at ambient temperature, however the rate of decay is slow. The lowest excited state of the diatomic oxygen molecule is a singlet state. It is a gas with physical properties differing only subtly from those of the more prevalent triplet ground state of O2. In terms of its chemical reactivity, however, singlet oxygen is far more reactive toward organic compounds. It is responsible for the photodegradation of many materials but can be put to constructive use in preparative organic chemistry and photodynamic therapy. Trace amounts of singlet oxygen are found in the upper atmosphere and also in polluted urban atmospheres where it contributes to the formation of lung- damaging nitrogen dioxide. It often appears and coexists confounded in environments that also generate ozone, such as pine forests with photodegradation of turpentine. The terms 'singlet oxygen' and 'triplet oxygen' derive from each form's number of electron spins. The singlet has only one possible arrangement of electron spins with a total quantum spin of 0, while the triplet has three possible arrangements of electron spins with a total quantum spin of 1, corresponding to three degenerate states. In spectroscopic notation, the lowest singlet and triplet forms of O2 are labeled 1Œîg and 3Œ£, respectively.  Electronic structure  Singlet oxygen refers to one of two singlet electronic excited states. The two singlet states are denoted 1Œ£ and 1Œîg (the preceding superscript \\"1\\" indicates a singlet state). The singlet states of oxygen are 158 and 95 kilojoules per mole higher in energy than the triplet ground state of oxygen. Under most common laboratory conditions, the higher energy 1Œ£ singlet state rapidly converts to the more stable, lower energy 1Œîg singlet state. This more stable of the two excited states has its two valence electrons spin-paired in one œÄ* orbital while the second œÄ* orbital is empty. This state is referred to by the title term, singlet oxygen, commonly abbreviated 1O2, to distinguish it from the triplet ground state molecule, 3O2. Molecular orbital theory predicts the electronic ground state denoted by the molecular term symbol 3Œ£, and two low-lying excited singlet states with term symbols 1Œîg and 1Œ£. These three electronic states differ only in the spin and the occupancy of oxygen's two antibonding œÄg-orbitals, which are degenerate (equal in energy). These two orbitals are classified as antibonding and are of higher energy. Following Hund's first rule, in the ground state, these electrons are unpaired and have like (same) spin. This open-shell triplet ground state of molecular oxygen differs from most stable diatomic molecules, which have singlet (1Œ£) ground states. Two less stable, higher energy excited states are readily accessible from this ground state, again in accordance with Hund's first rule; the first moves one of the high energy unpaired ground state electrons from one degenerate orbital to the other, where it \\"flips\\" and pairs the other, and creates a new state, a singlet state referred to as the 1Œîg state (a term symbol, where the preceding superscripted \\"1\\" indicates it as a singlet state). Alternatively, both electrons can remain in their degenerate ground state orbitals, but the spin of one can \\"flip\\" so that it is now opposite to the second (i.e., it is still in a separate degenerate orbital, but no longer of like spin); this also creates a new state, a singlet state referred to as the 1Œ£ state. The ground and first two singlet excited states of oxygen can be described by the simple scheme in the figure below.For triplet ground state on right side of diagram, see C.E.Housecroft and A.G.Sharpe Inorganic Chemistry, 2nd ed. (Pearson Prentice-Hall 2005), p.35 For changes in singlet states on left and in centre, see F. Albert Cotton and Geoffrey Wilkinson. Advanced Inorganic Chemistry, 5th ed. (John Wiley 1988), p.452 Molecular orbital diagram of two singlet excited states as well as the triplet ground state of molecular dioxygen. From left to right, the diagrams are for: 1Œîg singlet oxygen (first excited state), 1Œ£ singlet oxygen (second excited state), and 3Œ£ triplet oxygen (ground state). The lowest energy 1s molecular orbitals are uniformly filled in all three and are omitted for simplicity. The broad horizontal lines labelled œÄ and œÄ* each represent two molecular orbitals (for filling by up to 4 electrons in total). The three states only differ in the occupancy and spin states of electrons in the two degenerate œÄ* antibonding orbitals. The 1Œîg singlet state is 7882.4 cm‚àí1 above the triplet 3Œ£ ground state., which in other units corresponds to 94.29 kJ/mol or 0.9773 eV. The 1Œ£ singlet is 13 120.9 cm‚àí1 (157.0 kJ/mol or 1.6268 eV) above the ground state. Radiative transitions between the three low-lying electronic states of oxygen are formally forbidden as electric dipole processes. The two singlet-triplet transitions are forbidden both because of the spin selection rule ŒîS = 0 and because of the parity rule that g-g transitions are forbidden. The singlet-singlet transition between the two excited states is spin-allowed but parity-forbidden. The lower, O2(1Œîg) state is commonly referred to as singlet oxygen. The energy difference of 94.3 kJ/mol between ground state and singlet oxygen corresponds to a forbidden singlet-triplet transition in the near-infrared at ~1270 nm. As a consequence, singlet oxygen in the gas phase is relatively long lived (54-86 miliseconds),Physical Mechanisms of Generation and Deactivation of Singlet Oxygen Claude Schweitzer although interaction with solvents reduces the lifetime to microseconds or even nanoseconds. The higher 1Œ£ state is very short lived. In the gas phase, it relaxes primarily to the ground state triplet with a mean lifetime of 11.8 s. However in solvents such as CS2 and CCl4, it relaxes to the lower singlet 1Œîg in milliseconds due to nonradiative decay channels. =Paramagnetism due to orbital angular momentum= Both singlet oxygen states have no unpaired electrons and therefore no net electron spin. The 1Œîg is however paramagnetic as shown by the observation of an electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrum. The paramagnetism is due to a net orbital (and not spin) electronic angular momentum. In a magnetic field the degeneracy of the œÄ* level is split into two levels corresponding to molecular orbitals with angular momenta +1ƒß and ‚àí1ƒß around the molecular axis. In the 1Œîg state one of these orbitals is doubly occupied and the other empty, so that transitions are possible between the two.  Production  Various methods for the production of singlet oxygen exist. Irradiation of oxygen gas in the presence of an organic dye as a sensitizer, such as rose bengal, methylene blue, or porphyrins‚Äîa photochemical method‚Äîresults in its production. Large steady state concentrations of singlet oxygen are reported from the reaction of triplet excited state pyruvic acid with dissolved oxygen in water. Singlet oxygen can also be in non-photochemical, preparative chemical procedures. One chemical method involves the decomposition of triethylsilyl hydrotrioxide generated in situ from triethylsilane and ozone. :(C2H5)3SiH + O3 ‚Üí (C2H5)3SiOOOH ‚Üí (C2H5)3SiOH + O2(1Œîg) Another method uses the aqueous reaction of hydrogen peroxide with sodium hypochlorite: : H2O2 \\\\+ NaOCl ‚Üí O2(1Œîg) + NaCl + H2O A third method liberates singlet oxygen via phosphite ozonides, which are, in turn, generated in situ. Phosphite ozonides will decompose to give singlet oxygen: :(RO)3P + O3 ‚Üí (RO)3PO3 :(RO)3PO3 ‚Üí (RO)3PO + O2(1Œîg) An advantage of this method is that it is amenable to non- aqueous conditions. Reactions Singlet oxygen-based oxidation of citronellol. This is a net, but not a true ene reaction. Abbreviations, step 1: H2O2, hydrogen peroxide; Na2MoO4 (catalyst), sodium molybdate. Step 2: Na2SO3 (reducing agent), sodium sulfite. Because of differences in their electron shells, singlet and triplet oxygen differ in their chemical properties; singlet oxygen is highly reactive. The lifetime of singlet oxygen depends on the medium. In normal organic solvents, the lifetime is only a few microseconds whereas in solvents lacking C-H bonds, the lifetime can be as long as seconds. =Organic chemistry = Unlike ground state oxygen, singlet oxygen participates in Diels‚ÄìAlder [4+2]- and [2+2]-cycloaddition reactions and formal concerted ene reactions. It oxidizes thioethers to sulfoxides. Organometallic complexes are often degraded by singlet oxygen. With some substrates 1,2-dioxetanes are formed; cyclic dienes such as 1,3-cyclohexadiene form [4+2] cycloaddition adducts. The [4+2]-cycloaddition between singlet oxygen and furans is widely used in organic synthesis. In singlet oxygen reactions with alkenic allyl groups, e.g., citronella, shown, by abstraction of the allylic proton, in an ene-like reaction, yielding the allyl hydroperoxide, R‚ÄìO‚ÄìOH (R = alkyl), which can then be reduced to the corresponding allylic alcohol.This reaction is not a true ene reaction, because it is not concerted; singlet oxygen forms an \\"epoxide oxide\\" exciplex, which then abstracts the hydrogen. See Alberti et al, op. cit. In reactions with water trioxidane, an unusual molecule with three consecutive linked oxygen atoms, is formed.  Biochemistry  In photosynthesis, singlet oxygen can be produced from the light-harvesting chlorophyll molecules. One of the roles of carotenoids in photosynthetic systems is to prevent damage caused by produced singlet oxygen by either removing excess light energy from chlorophyll molecules or quenching the singlet oxygen molecules directly. In mammalian biology, singlet oxygen is one of the reactive oxygen species, which is linked to oxidation of LDL cholesterol and resultant cardiovascular effects. Polyphenol antioxidants can scavenge and reduce concentrations of reactive oxygen species and may prevent such deleterious oxidative effects. Ingestion of pigments capable of producing singlet oxygen with activation by light can produce severe photosensitivity of skin (see phototoxicity, photosensitivity in humans, photodermatitis, phytophotodermatitis). This is especially a concern in herbivorous animals (see Photosensitivity in animals). Singlet oxygen is the active species in photodynamic therapy.  Analytical and physical chemistry  Red glow of singlet oxygen passing into triplet state. Direct detection of singlet oxygen is possible using sensitive laser spectroscopy or through its extremely weak phosphorescence at 1270 nm, which is not visible. However, at high singlet oxygen concentrations, the fluorescence of the singlet oxygen \\"dimol\\" species‚Äîsimultaneous emission from two singlet oxygen molecules upon collision‚Äîcan be observed as a red glow at 634 nm and 703 nm.

History In 1937 the North China Area Army had chased Song Zheyuan's 29th Army to the south along the Jinpu Railway (see Tianjin‚ÄìPukou Railway Operation) after his defeat in the Battle of Lugou Bridge. After Japan won the Battle of Nanjing, the North China Area Army advanced southward to establish a Japanese connection between Beijing and Nanjing, ignoring the non-expansionist policy of the Imperial General Headquarters in Tokyo. Most mechanized and air forces in eastern China were wiped out in the Battle of Shanghai in 1937. Although new equipment was purchased, it had yet to be shipped. Han Fuqu, the chairman of the Shandong province, rejected orders from Chiang Kai-shek and kept retreating to preserve his force. After Qingdao was occupied in January 1938, his policy was denounced and he was executed on 24 January. In March 1938 Japanese forces occupied the north of Shandong, including the capital city Jinan. The defense line along the Yellow River was torn apart. Due to pressure from Japanese forces, 64 Chinese divisions gathered around Xuzhou in Jiangsu, the headquarters of 5th Military Region of the National Revolutionary Army. Without surrounding it, Gen. Itagaki Seishiro moved south first to attack Tai'erzhuang, where he was defeated by Li Zongren in a regional asymmetric battle. Following this defeat Japan intended an encirclement against Xuzhou and deployed the North China Area Army to the north and the Central China Expeditionary Army to the south. The North China Area Army had four divisions and two infantry brigades drawn from the Kwantung Army. Central China Expeditionary Army had three divisions and the 1st and 2nd Tank Battalions with motorized support units formed into the Iwanaka and Imada Detachments, which were ordered to advance to the west of Xuzhou to cut off and prevent Chinese forces from withdrawing towards the west. The 5th Tank Battalion was used to support the 3rd Infantry Division advancing north along the railway to Xuzhou. Additional troops were deployed in the Battle of Northern and Eastern Henan by the North China Area Army to stop Chinese reinforcements from the west. A Chinese counterattack here resulted in the Battle of Lanfeng. However, with the approach of the Central China Expeditionary Army from the south, the overall situation was grim, and Chiang Kai-shek ordered the withdrawal of the armies. The demolition of the dykes holding back the Yellow River allowed him more time for the preparation of the defense of Wuhan, but the resulting 1938 Yellow River flood also destroyed much of the area around the new course of the river and claimed appalling losses among chinese civilians: est. 400,000‚Äì500,000 dead and 3 million refugees.Lary, Diana (1 April 2001). \\"Drowned Earth: The Strategic Breaching of the Yellow River Dyke, 1938\\".

The Japanese army won the fierce battle and ultimately captured Xuzhou, but Japanese forces were too small to contain the large number of encircled Chinese troops. Most of the Chinese soldiers broke through the encirclement through gaps in the Japanese lines to the west or dispersed into the countryside as guerrillas. By successfully breaking out of the Japanese encirclement, the Chinese were able to preserve most of their forces. These units would form approximately 50% of the Chinese forces participating in the Defense of Wuhan.Hsu Long-hsuen and Chang Ming- kai, History of The Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945) 2nd Ed., 1971.

It is especially common in situations involving customer service. Music on hold is sometimes referred to as phone on hold, message on hold, on hold messaging, or hold music. Development Music on hold was created by Alfred Levy, an inventor, factory owner, and entrepreneur. In 1962, Levy discovered a problem with the phone lines at his factory: a loose wire was touching a metal girder on the building. This made the building a giant receiver so that the audio broadcast signal from a radio station next door would transmit through the loose wire and could be heard when calls were put on hold.Article Levy patented his work in 1966. While other advancements have come to change and enhance the technology, it was this initial patent creation that began the evolution for today's music on hold. Equipment and formats Most MOH systems are integrated into a telephone system designed for businesses via an audio jack on the telephone equipment labeled \\"MOH\\". There are also some units with built-in message on hold capabilities and units designed for small businesses without an extensive phone system. Today, equipment that supports physical media usually plays CDs. Some older systems may still use cassette tapes (sometimes employing endless-loops), or reel-to-reel tape players. In each case, the unit loads the media into a digital memory chip to prevent premature wearing of the mechanical parts. Equipment that supports virtual media generally plays MP3 files. Several types of units play these files. USB flash drive units allow an MP3 file to be received electronically, downloaded to a flash drive and connected to the player. Ethernet based remote load units connect via the network to a remote IP address. Phone line based remote load systems allow for a connection via an analog telephone line and dialing the number belonging to the unit. For VoIP phone systems, MP3s are loaded without any equipment. Newer technology allows MP3 files to be downloaded automatically from the internet so that messages (or interesting content in the form of news and weather, amongst many) can be changed daily. The new \\"online on hold\\" technology makes the older technology redundant since it requires no additional hardware. All these systems allow analog-to-digital audio storage and playback. As of 2011 technology allows productions to be downloaded or streamed via the Internet or played through a USB flash drive. Consumer perceptions A number of studies have been conducted, which highlight consumer perceptions of music on hold, reinforcing its use by businesses to improve standards of call handling. A survey of more than 2,000 UK consumers commissioned by audio branding specialist PHMG revealed 70% of consumers are put on hold for more than 50% of their calls. When put on hold, 73% of callers want to hear something other than beeps or silence.ArticleArticle A CNN survey found that 70 percent of callers in the United States who hold the line in silence hang up within 60 seconds. Meanwhile, research by North American Telecom found callers hearing music on hold will stay on the line 30 seconds longer than callers experiencing silence. Source of music =Radio= The musical source may be as simple as playing a local radio station through the MOH jack. This is unlawful without the express permission of the music title and mechanical copyright holders, or their representatives. * Although radio stations may provide the desired musical format, there is no control over the specific songs that are played, some of which may be offensive to the callers, or depending on the music played, sound harsh in monaural sound. This kind of system is also vulnerable to interference. * Radio stations typically do not license their music for MOH systems. In the United States, the radio broadcaster has no legal right to provide such a license as they, themselves, obtain a usage license from the music title owner for the right to broadcast said music for limited and personal use. As mentioned above, re-broadcasting of a radio program over a phone system calls for licensing and copyright arrangements to be made for the owner of the MOH system. * Most radio stations (excluding those that are part of non-commercial educational radio networks) will play commercials, which may be offensive or annoying to the caller. Furthermore, it is possible that a competitor's commercial may be played, which would be counter-productive. :See Legal aspects. Owners of radio stations will usually air their broadcast signal as music on hold, using their main program signal, if there are several. Examples include R√öV from Iceland using R√°s 1 as the on- hold music. =Off-the-shelf commercial CDs= Commercial CDs eliminate the problems encountered with radio commercials, and they offer control over the selection of music; they do not, however, grant proper license for MOH use unless users first obtain permission from the song title copyright owner (when the song is not in the \\"public domain\\") and the mechanical copyright owner, or bodies that represent them, such as BMI or ASCAP. (See \\"Radio,\\" above, for more details.) =Stock MOH CDs (with or without voice-overs)= CDs are available that have been specifically recorded and licensed for MOH systems. These may contain only music, or may include periodic voice-overs with messages such as \\"Your call is important\\" or \\"Please stay on the line\\". Such off-the-shelf recordings may be generic or may be specific to individual industries, but will not be customized for individual companies. =Custom- designed MOH= In general, custom music on hold is advised to: #Control content #Control music genre #Use the on hold time to sell to a captive audience #Through a reputable on hold company be fully licensed and legal for on hold playback #Reduce hang-ups and make the business look more professional #Control length of programming based on average caller hold-time CDs (or other MOH formats, such as MP3 files) can be custom-created to suit the particular needs of a business. The announcements can be scripted to emphasize particular attributes of the business such as location, store hours, or special promotions or services. These are typically used for up-selling and cross- selling callers. Companies can either record the messages themselves, or hire a music on hold production company. =Online on hold= A program loaded onto an existing computer and connected to the phone system can allow automatic content updates interspersed with company information. =Streaming MOH= Streaming MOH refers to a live music on hold stream (URL-based delivery) which can also include custom content. Streaming MOH can also refer to a streaming media server, as with Cisco Unified Call Manager, in which case RTP format is utilized. =Free on-hold programs= Programs available to non-profit organizations at no cost. Very few companies offer absolutely free programs. The programs are available in generic and custom formats, and are delivered at no cost to the requesting organization. Styles of music The style of music played by MOH systems depends largely on the type of business offering the service. It is generally best to present music that will not be offensive to the audience, but that would also be of particular interest to the typical caller. A western apparel store may choose to play country music. A Christian book store may choose to play popular Christian music. A university may choose to play classical music. An athletic ticket office may choose to play the team or school's fight song. Light classics, smooth jazz, and beautiful music are common choices, as is fully synthesized melodic music. Among the best known is \\"Opus Number One\\", largely forgotten by Tim Carleton and high-school friend Darrick Deel, the teenagers that recorded it on a four-track tape recorder in 1989. Deel went on to work for Cisco in building the company's first VoIP phone. When a need for default on hold music came up, he recalled the track he and Carleton had recorded and reached out to Carleton for approval. Recent trends With the application of newer equipment, music on hold devices can now interact with the caller. No additional programs are required on the platform, as all the logic is done with the MoH device. This can include services such as 'polling on hold', rating your customer service officer anonymously, etc. The trend toward hosted IP telephony for business phone systems is demanding changes in music on hold message technology. Legal aspects =Copyright law= In the US, and other countries where copyright laws are practiced, authors are granted copyright protection on their musical compositions. Such copyright protection has existed since just after the turn of the 20th century and most music written prior to 1900‚Äì1910‚Äîfrom impressionism back to baroque and antiquity are said to be \\"in the public domain.\\" Use of any said music prior to the creation of these copyright laws may be presumed to be free for use by all‚Äîalthough individual titles may have been later copyrighted through a change in the composition or arrangement. The use of copyrighted music is not for free use in the public domain. All music written after this period, which is copyrighted under multiple acts of congress, are owned by the author(s) or their assignees. The use of this music is protected and controlled in order that the owner may derive usage income. Specific to telephonic MOH (music-on-hold), the US laws currently protect the copyright owners from unlawful, unpermitted use of their music titles in over- the-phone broadcast. Any person or business wishing to use current, popular, post 1900‚Äì1910, copyrighted music for MOH purposes may only lawfully do so by obtaining permission from the owner. Currently, performance rights societies such as ASCAP, BMI and SESAC will sell blanket permission to use music titles in their catalog for MOH purposes‚Äîfor an express annual fee‚Äîcalculated by size and frequency of usage. Failure to obtain this paid permission is a violation of US copyright laws. This same copyright protection is also true in the rebroadcast of any radio program. As mentioned earlier, the broadcaster has been assigned a narrow and specific usage license to air copyrighted song titles. This does not include permission to any person or business to re- broadcast that program on telephonic MOH. The broadcaster may not promote such unlawful use and is not an owner who has any lawful right to grant MOH usage permission. They do not hold the ownership of the title and have no right to license use in any way. Those who plug radio broadcast into their telephone MOH without first obtaining paid permission through the owner's agents (ASCAP, BMI or SESAC) may be in violation of copyright law and may be prosecuted under existing federal laws. =Mechanical copyright= A second copyright exists when it comes to licensing use for telephonic MOH. A piece of music, as mentioned above, is copyrighted and may be licensed for use as a music title and is understood to be a combination of melody, harmony and, where applicable, lyrics. However, neither radio listeners nor MOH listeners could hear this music unless it was recorded - providing a delivery medium whereby the \\"music\\" becomes a \\"performance.\\" As mentioned elsewhere, in countries such as the US, where said copyright laws are enforced, nearly every recording of a song title holds its own \\"mechanical copyright.\\" For most of the 20th century, music was recorded in studios, produced by record company executives, producers, arrangers and engineers who were hired to deliver the artist's finished recordings for mastering and duplication‚Äîfor sale on the varied media: 78, 45 and 33 RPM vinyl, reel-to-reel, 8-track tape, cassette and compact disc. To protect their investment, the record companies obtain a mechanical copyright in order to protect and control the recording with which they derive usage and sales income. (For those still uncertain of the difference between \\"song title\\" and \\"mechanical\\" copyrights, consider the Capitol Records lawsuit for copyright infringement against Nike some 20 years ago. Nike legally obtained permission to use the Beatles song title \\"Revolution\\" from the title's owner, Michael Jackson. They used the Capitol Records owned recording of the Beatles' performance, but failed to obtain and pay for permission and use. Capitol Records sued and prevailed because Nike ONLY had a license to use the title and did not have a license to use the mechanical recording.) Therefore, persons or businesses wishing to play music that falls \\"in the public domain\\" are still legally required to obtain permission to use the mechanical recording of this music, from the mechanical copyright holder. And where the use is of copyrighted music, the same applies. In all cases, before a song title may be broadcast on a telephone MOH, said use must be approved and licensed from BOTH the \\"song title\\" copyright owner (if it is NOT in public domain) and the \\"mechanical\\" copyright owner. =Enforcement= It is generally known within the on-hold industry that some performance rights societies, with regional offices and staff, both monitor and prosecute persons and businesses that infringe on the copyright of title holders in their libraries. ASCAP and BMI are both aggressive about this, from time to time. It is not known whether any record companies are currently or actively monitoring and prosecuting violators of their mechanical license.

He played seven seasons in the Major League Baseball (MLB), from until , with the Cincinnati Reds, Atlanta Braves, and Seattle Mariners. Professional career =Red Sox and Reds= Reitsma, drafted in the first round of the 1996 MLB draft by the Boston Red Sox (34th overall), made his MLB debut in 2001 for the Cincinnati Reds. After spending three seasons with the Reds as both a starter and reliever, the Atlanta Braves traded for him on March 26, 2004 to bolster their bullpen. =Atlanta Braves= Reitsma was used as a setup man for Atlanta's closer John Smoltz in 2004. He appeared in 84 games and did a serviceable job, however he was shelled in Game 5 of the 2004 National League Division Series against the Houston Astros, allowing the game to be broken open, and essentially ending the Braves' season. In , with newly acquired closer Danny Kolb getting off to a rough start, the Braves elected to use Reitsma as the closer rather than returning John Smoltz to that role. Reitsma did relatively well, earning 15 saves, but on the last day of non-waiver trades, the Braves traded for relief pitcher Kyle Farnsworth from the Detroit Tigers. Farnsworth soon replaced Reitsma as the closer, sending Reitsma back to being a setup man. With the Braves unable to retain Farnsworth, who signed with the New York Yankees following the 2005 season, the team feverishly searched to fill the closer's role through free agency or a trade. However, they were not able to find anyone to fill the hole left by Farnsworth's departure, and because of this, Reitsma had numerous chances to be the Braves' closer in . However, he proved to be ineffective in the job throughout his abbreviated season. On July 3, 2006, Reitsma was placed on the disabled list with ulnar neuritis in his right arm. He spent the rest of the season on the disabled list. Bob Wickman was brought in to replace Reitsma near the trade deadline, and after performing well, Wickman was signed to a contract in the offseason by the Braves. =Seattle Mariners= Reitsma was non-tendered by the Braves on December 12, 2006. The Seattle Mariners signed him to a one-year deal with a club option for on January 5, 2007, to be their setup man for incumbent closer J. J. Putz. Reitmsa's 2007 season was marred by injuries, making his last appearance on July 29. He was placed on the 15-day disabled list on July 30 and was transferred to the 60-day disabled list on September 4, ending his season. After the season, his club option was not picked up and Reitsma became a free agent. On January 10, 2008, he re-signed with the Mariners to a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training. However, he never pitched with the Mariners in 2008, and has not played professionally since. International career Reitsma was selected Canada national baseball team at the 2006 World Baseball Classic and 2008 Beijing Olympic Games. Pitching style Reitsma featured three pitches, a sinking fastball which sometimes would induce groundballs, as well a changeup. He also possessed a big, looping curveball which he did not throw as much as his fastball and changeup. Atlanta Braves coaches attempted to have Reitsma focus on only two pitches in an attempt to simplify his delivery. Personal life He is married to Janelle and has three daughters, Kylie, Emily and Allyson. He graduated from Calgary Christian High School in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, with three varsity letters in basketball. He is also a dual citizen of both Canada and the United States. He is a born-again Christian. =The Grim Reitsma= Reitsma's team nickname on the Mariners was \\"The Grim Reitsma\\". Reitsma himself was apparently the last to know his bullpen brethren had taken to wearing T-shirts with his name on them. The relievers began wearing gray shirts with the words \\"The Grim Reitsma\\" on them, complete with a maple leaf logo ‚Äî Reitsma is Canadian ‚Äî and the picture of a Grim Reaper. Seattle reliever George Sherrill and strength coach Allen Wirtala had the shirts made up shortly after a game at Yankee Stadium. Reitsma had gotten up in the bullpen when a fan stood up in the stands and shouted, \\"Grim Reitsma!\\" Reitsma went on the disabled list shortly after. \\"I didn't even know about the shirts until I got back\\", he said. \\"I saw everybody wearing them.\\" =Philanthropy= Reitsma also performs generous charity work in the off season with the mentally and physically handicapped. On June 20, 2008, Reitsma was named as spokesman for the Parkinson's Society of Southern Alberta's SuperWalk fundraiser. Reitsma's father Mike, former senior pastor of River Park Church in Calgary, was diagnosed with Parkinson's in 1985. Chris is the founder of Reitsma's Relievers, whose mission is to benefit at-risk children, youth and their families by providing assistance, programs and events designed to build self-esteem, provide unique life changing opportunities and help them to set and achieve their life goals.

It consisted of three separate battles in the Chinese provinces of Henan, Hunan and Guangxi. These battles were the Japanese Operation Kogo or Battle of Central Henan, Operation Togo 1 or the Battle of Changheng, and Operation Togo 2 and Togo 3, or the Battle of Guilin-Liuzhou, respectively. The two primary goals of Ichi-go were to open a land route to French Indochina, and capture air bases in southeast China from which American bombers were attacking the Japanese homeland and shipping.The U.S. Army Campaigns of World War II: China Defensive, pg. 21 In Japanese the operation was also called Tairiku Dats≈´ Sakusen (), or \\"Continent Cross-Through Operation\\", while the Chinese refer to it as the Battle of Henan-Hunan-Guangxi (). Japanese plans Operation Ichi-Go had two aims. One aim was to neutralize American airfields in southern China. The Japanese were alarmed by American air raids against Japanese forces in Taiwan's Hsinchu airfield by American bombers based in southern China and correctly deduced that southern China could become the base for a major American bombing campaign against the Japanese home islands. Another aim was to link railways in Beijing and Hankou in northern China to the southern Chinese coast at Canton, to spare shipping. Prelude Starting in 1942, Nationalist China diverted troops to retake the province of Xinjiang from the Soviet client-state of Sheng Shicai, whose army was supported by the Soviet Red Army's 8th Regiment in Hami, Xinjiang. The Soviets became involved in the province during the Soviet invasion of Xinjiang in 1934, where the Soviets occupied northern Xinjiang. The Soviets obtained control over the rest of Xinjiang after the Islamic rebellion in Xinjiang in 1937, placing all the province under Sheng Shicai control. The fighting then escalated in early 1944 with the Ili Rebellion; the Soviet-backed Uyghur Communist rebels forced China to commit 120,000 troops in opposition to the rebellion. Compounding the previous difficulties, China had become overconfident after a string of three victories in defense of Changsha; the Battle of Changsha (1939), the Battle of Changsha (1941), and the Battle of Changsha (1942). Chiang Kai-shek and Republic of China authorities deliberately ignored a tip from the French military in Indochina of the impending Japanese offensive. The Chinese military believed the tip to be a result of Japanese disinformation, since only 30,000 Japanese soldiers were involved in the first manoeuvre of Operation Ichi-Go. Since the Japanese force only crossed the Yellow river in Northern China, the Chinese believed that it was a small scale offensive. Another major factor was that the battlefront between China and Japan had remained static since 1940, and Chiang Kai-shek believed Japan was reluctant to break the stalemate. In Northern China, Japan had been content to merely support the puppet government of Wang Jingwei and exploit resources in occupied territories. The Japanese indeed acted this way for most of the 1940s, only making a few weak, failed attempts to capture China's provisional capital in Chongqing. Japan had previously exhibited no intention of linking the transcontinental Beijing-Hankou and Canton (Guangzhou)-Hankou railways. In addition to its earlier victories in Changsha, China had also defeated Japan in the India-Burma theater with X Force and Y Force. China believed the Burma theater to be of far more strategic importance than Southern China, which contributed to their decision to ignore French intelligence. China believed the initial Japanese attack in Ichi-Go to be a localized feint in northern China, so 400,000 troops in Northern China were deliberately withdrawn without a fight in the face of the Japanese advance. The initial force of 30,000 Japanese troops soon grew to number several hundred thousand, and the Chinese defensive line collapsed as the offensive pressed into Central and South China. However, a contingent of 17,000 Chinese held Hengyang against over 110,000 Japanese soldiers in what would become the longest siege of the war. The siege resulted 19,000-60,000 deaths for the Japanese. At Tushan, the Republic of China was forced to deploy 5 armies of the 8th war zone that they were using in the entire war up to Ichigo to contain the Communist Chinese to instead fight Japan. But at that point, dietary deficiencies of Japanese soldiers and increasing casualties suffered by Japan forced Japan to end Operation Ichigo in Guizhou causing the operation to cease. After Operation Ichigo, Chiang Kai-shek started a plan to withdrew Chinese troops from the Burma theatre against Japan in Southeast Asia for a counter offensive called \\"White Tower\\" and \\"Iceman\\" against Japanese soldiers in China in 1945.Hsiung, China's Bitter Victory pgs. 162-166 Campaign 1944 Operation Ichigo There were two phases to the operation. In the first phase, the Japanese secured the Pinghan Railway between Beijing and Wuhan; in the second, they displaced the US air forces stationed in Hunan province and reached the city of Liuzhou, near the border with Japanese-held Indochina. 17 divisions, including 500,000 men, 15,000 vehicles, 6,000 artillery pieces, 800 tanks and 100,000 horses participated in this operation. The Japanese included Kwantung Army units and equipment from Manchukuo, mechanized units, units from the North China theater and units from mainland Japan to participate in this campaign. It was the largest land campaign organized by the Japanese during the entire Second Sino-Japanese War. Many of the newest American-trained Chinese units and supplies were forcibly locked in the Burmese theater under Joseph Stilwell set by terms of the Lend-Lease Agreement. Operation Ichigo, IJA invading Henan, 1944 In Operation Kogo, 390,000 Chinese soldiers, led by General Tang Enbo (), were deployed to defend the strategic position of Luoyang. The 3rd Tank Division of the IJA crossed the Yellow River around Zhengzhou in late April and defeated Chinese forces near Xuchang, then swung around clockwise and besieged Luoyang. Luoyang was defended by three Chinese divisions. The 3rd Tank Division began to attack Luoyang on May 13 and took it on May 25. Japanese occupation (red) of eastern China near the end of the war, and Communist guerrilla bases (striped) The second phase of Ichigo began in May, following the success of the first phase. Japanese forces advanced southward and occupied Changsha, Hengyang, Guilin and Liuzhou. At the Defense of Hengyang, the Japanese only won a Pyrrhic victory since 17,000 Chinese soldiers held out against over 110,000 Japanese soldiers from June 22‚ÄìAugust 8, 1944,inflicting 19,000-60,000 dead on the Japanese. In December 1944, Japanese forces reached French Indochina and achieved the purpose of the operation. Nevertheless, there were few practical gains from this offensive. US air forces moved inland from the threatened bases near the coast. The operation also forced British Commandos working with the Chinese as part of Mission 204 to leave China and return to Burma. The U.S. Fourteenth Air Force often disrupted the Hunan‚ÄìGuangxi Railway between Hengyang and Liuzhou that had been established in Operation Ichigo. Japan continued to attack airfields where US air forces were stationed up to the spring of 1945. The XX Bomber Command operating Strategic B-29 bombers of the Twentieth Air Force, which were attacking Japan in Operation Matterhorn, were forced to move as well, but although this affected their efficiency for a short time, in early 1945 the Twentieth Air Force moved to newly established bases in the Marianas under the command of the newly established XXI Bomber Command. This nullified the limited protection that the Japanese home islands had received from Operation Ichigo. =Henan peasants attack Kuomintang forces= General Jiang Dingwen of the First War Zone gave his account of the behavior of Henan civilians: \\"During the campaign, the unexpected phenomenon was that the people of the mountains in western Henan attacked our troops, taking guns, bullets, and explosives, and even high-powered mortars and radio equipment... They surrounded our troops and killed our officers. We heard this pretty often. The heads of the villages and baojia (village mutual-responsibility groups) just ran away. At the same time, they took away our stored grain, leaving their houses and fields empty, which meant that our officers and soldiers had no food for many days.\\" This was revenge for the 1938 Yellow River flood and the Chinese famine of 1942‚Äì43. General Jiang's account also said: \\"Actually this is truly painful for me to say: in the end the damages we suffered from the attacks by the people were more serious than the losses from battles with the enemy.\\" The Henan peasants picked up the weapons Kuomintang troops had abandoned to defend themselves against the Japanese. When the Kuomintang army ordered the Henan locals to destroy the local highways to prevent the Japanese advance, they refused. In fact they sometimes even went back at night and mended roads which the army had torn up by day. Aftermath With the rapid deterioration of the Chinese front after Japanese launched Operation Ichi-Go in 1944, General Joseph Stilwell saw this as an opportunity to win his political struggle against Chiang Kai-shek, China's leader, and gain full command of all Chinese armed forces. He was able to convince General George Marshall to have President Franklin D. Roosevelt send an ultimatum to Chiang threatening to end all American aid unless Chiang \\"at once\\" placed Stilwell \\"in unrestricted command of all your forces.\\"Romanus and Sunderland, Stilwell's Command Problem, p.446‚Äì447 An exultant Stilwell immediately delivered this letter to Chiang despite pleas from Patrick Hurley, Roosevelt's special envoy in China, to delay delivering the message and work on a deal that would achieve Stilwell's aim in a manner more acceptable to Chiang.Lohbeck, Hurley, p.292 Seeing this act as a move toward the complete subjugation of China, a defiant Chiang gave a formal reply in which he said that Stilwell must be replaced immediately and he would welcome any other qualified U.S. general to fill Stilwell's position.Lohbeck, Hurley, p.298Romanus and Sunderland, Stilwell's Command Problem, p.452 As a result, Stilwell was replaced as Chief of Staff to Chiang Kai-shek and commander of the U.S. Forces, China Theater (USFCT) by Major General Albert Wedemeyer. Stilwell's other command responsibilities in the China Burma India Theater were divided up and allocated to other officers. Although Chiang was successful in removing Stilwell, the public relations damage suffered by his Chinese Nationalist Party (Kuomintang) regime was irreparable. Right before Stilwell's departure, New York Times drama critic-turned-war correspondent Brooks Atkinson interviewed him in Chungking and wrote: > The decision to relieve General Stilwell represents the political triumph of > a moribund, anti-democratic regime that is more concerned with maintaining > its political supremacy than in driving the Japanese out of China. The > Chinese Communists... have good armies that they are claiming to be fighting > guerrilla warfare against the Japanese in North China‚Äîactually they are > covertly or even overtly building themselves up to fight Generalissimo's > government forces... The Generalissimo [Chiang Kai-shek] naturally regards > these armies as the chief threat to the country and his supremacy... has > seen no need to make sincere attempt to arrange at least a truce with them > for the duration of the war... No diplomatic genius could have overcome the > Generalissimo's basic unwillingness to risk his armies in battle with the > Japanese. Atkinson, who had visited Mao Zedong in the communist capital of Yenan, saw his Communist Chinese forces as a democratic movement (after Atkinson visited Mao, his article on his visit was titled Yenan: A Chinese Wonderland City), and the Nationalists in turn as hopelessly reactionary and corrupt. This view was shared by many U.S. journalists in China at the time, but due to pro- Chiang Allied press censorship, it was not as well known to their readers until Stilwell's recall and the ensuing anti-Chiang coverage forced it into the open. The Japanese successes in Operation Ichi-Go had a limited effect on the war. The U.S. could still bomb the Japanese homeland from Saipan and other Pacific bases. In the territories seized, Japanese forces controlled only the cities, not their surrounding countryside. The increased size of the occupied territory also thinned out the Japanese lines. A great majority of the Chinese forces were able to retreat out of the area, and later come back to attack Japanese positions. As a result, future Japanese attempts to fight into Sichuan, such as in the Battle of West Hunan, ended in failure. All in all, Japan was not any closer in defeating China after this operation, and the constant defeats the Japanese suffered in the Pacific meant that Japan never got the time and resources needed to achieve final victory over China. The Japanese suffered 11,742 KIAs by mid-November, and the number of soldiers that died of illness was more than twice this.http://d.hatena.ne.jp/Apeman/20070710/p1Until mid-November, IJA had a illness toll of 66,000Ôºåand a field hospital had taken in 6164 soldiers, 2,281 of which died due to malnutrition È§ìÊ≠ª„Åó„ÅüËã±Èúä„Åü„Å° P116 The total death toll was about 100,000 by the end of 1944. Operation Ichi-go created a great sense of social confusion in the areas of China that it affected. Chinese Communist guerrillas were able to exploit this confusion to gain influence and control of greater areas of the countryside in the aftermath of Ichi-go.China at War: An Encyclopedia. Ed. Li Xiaobing. United States of America: ABC-CLIO. 2012. . Retrieved May 21, 2012. p.163. In popular culture The 1958 novel The Mountain Road, by Theodore White, a Time magazine correspondent in China at the time of the offensive, was based on an interview with former OSS Major Frank Gleason, who led a demolition group of American soldiers during the offensive that were charged with blowing up anything left behind in the retreat that might be of use to Japan. His group ultimately destroyed over 150 bridges and 50,000 tons of munitions, helping slow the Japanese advance. In 1960, it was adapted into a film starring James Stewart and Lisa Lu, noteworthy for being one of Stewart's only war films and the only one where he plays a soldier, as he was opposed to war films due to their inaccuracy. It is generally believed he made an exception for this film because it was anti-war.

In 1982, TSP was reorganized as a week-long event and was held at the Prude Guest Ranch near Fort Davis, Texas. For one year only, in 1997, the event was held at Alto Frio Baptist Encampment, on the banks of the Frio River, 40 miles north of Uvalde, Texas. Also in 1997, \\"Texas Star Party, Inc.\\" was registered as a Texas Non-Profit Corporation. In 1998, TSP returned to Prude Ranch, where it continues to be held annually in late April or in May near the time of new moon. By 2007, the event attracted 580 attendees, even though the weather was very poor. Attendees mostly come from across North America, and some from far overseas. Activities include dark sky observing and imaging, an astrophotography contest, guest speakers, tours of McDonald Observatory, commercial vendors, and the opportunity to view numerous home built telescopes and gadgets. TSP is well known for its very dark skies due to its elevation in the Davis Mountains of around and it remoteness from artificial light sources. It has strongly supported efforts to reduce light pollution. Two annual awards have traditionally been presented at TSP: The Lone Star Gazer Award (for personal achievement, accomplishment, and expertise) and The Omega Centauri Award (for public awareness and/or promotion of astronomy). Complete lists of all past award winners as well as past guest speakers may be found on the TSP History page listed below. The TSP's observing fields at the Prude Ranch are the central field, the upper field, the upper-upper field, and the lower field. The TSP holds telescope programs of varying levels, binocular programs, a novice program, and an advanced observing program. The programs require the participant to observe a certain number of specified objects, and completion of a program will be awarded by a pin and in some cases another award. The binocular programs are usually a regular binocular program, an advanced binocular program, and a binocular program \\"from hell\\". While at TSP 1996, Brian A. Skiff named one of the asteroids that he had previously discovered. That asteroid, 4932 Texstapa (), was discovered on March 9, 1984 and was named for the Texas Star Party on the occasion of its 18th anniversary in May 1996. The TSP is run by around 50-70 volunteers each year, drawn mostly from amateur astronomy clubs with support from the University of Texas‚Äô McDonald Observatory. The 42nd TSP was cancelled in 2020 caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. It was deferred to 2021.

It also offers Koshihikari rice grown from Niigata. Controversies On 25 March 2015, BreadTalk pulled buns commemorating Mr Lee Kuan Yew off shelves after receiving flak from the public. Although the proceeds from sale of the buns were meant for charitable purposes, poor communication of intentions led to the misunderstanding. BreadTalk apologised publicly on its Facebook page. On 4 August 2015, BreadTalk stopped selling soya milk previously labelled \\"freshly prepared\\" as they confirmed (after being confronted with photographic evidence) that the product was repackaged Yeo's soya milk packet drink.

It was founded in 1973 by Togba Nah Tipoteh, who is currently its president.  Liberia  Early members include Henry Boimah Fahnbulleh, Dew Tuan-Wreh Mason, and Amb. Conmany B. Wesseh, Sr, who is currently a senator representing River Gee County. Amos Sawyer, who served as president of the Interim Government of National Unity (IGNU) in 1990‚Äì94, and Kukoi Samba Sanyang, a Gambian revolutionary who had been one of the leaders of a coup attempt in Banjul in 1981. MOJA played an important role in the struggle for social justice and democracy in Liberia. Its sensitization work in the 1970s raised national political consciousness to an unprecedentedly high level, radicalizing the mass of urban and rural poor and sections of the military. The heightened political consciousness and agitation it caused led to the collapse of the settler oligarchy that had ruled Liberia in a colonial manner for over a century.  Gambia  An Africa Contemporary Record in Gambia states that the group Movement for Justice in Africa (Moja-G) published an underground newspaper, The Voice of the Future. The group was prosecuted for publishing an underground newspaper, but leaders of Moja-G technically escaped prosecution. It drew support from disaffected youth in the Banjul-Serrekunda conurbation. The group attacked the People's Progressive Party (PPP) and the country's colonial past. The Europa publication, Africa South of the Sahara 1989, further states that Moja-G had an ideological affinity with a movement of the same name in Liberia, which worked for an overthrow of the Tolbert regime in that country. MOJA has waned significancantly in recent years; but in early 2007, efforts aimed at reviving the movement were initiated. The group operated as a self-styled Marxist group, rejecting parliamentary opposition as futile and advocated extreme political measures. In Gambia's Pre-Crisis phase of political evolution (February 18, 1965-October 26, 1980), after the PPP political party won the elections, the Movement for Justice in Africa ‚Äì Gambia (MOJA-Gambia) was established by Koro Sallah in 1979 as part of the response to the PPP. However, during the Crisis Phase (October 27, 1980-February 8, 1985), two opposition groups, MOJA-Gambia and the Gambia Socialist Revolutionary Party (GSRP) headed by Pingon Georges, were banned by President Jawara for their involvement in the rebellion on November 1, 1980. Dissident Movements and Degenhardt's Revolutionary states that authorities were investigating the group for burning boats in Gambian ports. They also stated that Koro Sallah, the founder of Moja-G, was killed in an attempted coup in July 1981, and MOJA participates in elections under the name Liberian People's Party.

It synthesized the position of the Japanese government on historical recognition and reconciliation with Asia and other nations subjected to Japanese colonialism, primarily involving China and the Republic of Korea. It recognizes the judgements of war tribunals prescribed in Article 11 of the San Francisco Peace Treaty. In this way, the Murayama Statement played a significant role in both the reconciliation of war issues as well as the shift in both domestic and international perception of Japan. Tomiichi Murayama (1924- )  Background  = Japanese Imperialism and War Crimes = Former Chief Cabinet Secretary Yohei Kono (1937- ) The Murayama statement apologizes for Japanese war crimes and atrocities committed during the period of Japanese imperialism, especially during the Second Sino- Japanese War, World War II, and the annexation of South Korea. The war crimes mainly involved the Imperial Japanese Army and the Imperial Japanese Navy, responsible for the deaths of millions. Actions include a wide range including torture of prisoners of war, forced labor, biological warfare, looting, rape, and the use of comfort women. In addition to, Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs states the country acknowledges its role in the damage caused by Japan during World War II. = The Kono Statement (1993) = Japanese governments have issued several official apologies for their war crimes and other actions during the Imperial era. The apology that most immediately preceded the Murayama Statement was the Kono Statement announced by LDP Chief Cabinet Secretary Y≈çhei K≈çno on August 4, 1993. With this statement, Japan acknowledged for the first time that their military was directly or indirectly involved in the military-run brothels and used coercion to make the comfort women provide sex to the Japanese soldiers.  Development of the Statement  The idea of developing a formal, comprehensive apology was raised in January 1995, when the long-dominant Liberal Democratic Party of Japan (LDP) was forced to share power with the Japan Socialist Party (JSP). JSP President Murayama was given the prime ministership in the power-sharing agreement. The Lower House Speaker Takako Doi of JSP emphasized the necessity of trying to resolve Asian distrust in Japan. However, this was first met by strong opposition within the government, with many believing that Japan had already apologized sufficiently for the war, or that the renouncement of war could suggest Japan was abrogating its right to self defense. To overcome opposition to an apology and reach a resolution, Murayama met with the secretary general of each of the three governing parties on May 25 and asked for negotiations to reach an agreement. He targeted his campaign at the younger leaders of the LDP, including Junichiro Koizumi, former minister of posts and telecommunications and a future prime minister. The leaders reportedly promised Murayama a resolution containing clear expressions of regret. The drafting of the document was a process involving much conflict over wording and expressions, for example with the LDP's rejection of unilateral incrimination of Japan against the Socialists feeling that ambiguity in the statement would greatly detract from its significance. Sakutaro Tanino, a member of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was among those who contributed to the drafting process of the Statement. Tanino was responsible for changing the ambiguous wordings through the implementation of the word \\"aggression\\" in the statement. When formulating the statement, Murayama chose the route of \\"cabinet decision\\", a comparatively more politically binding procedure than \\"cabinet understanding\\". Murayama expressed his wish for his statement to be interpreted as the will of the cabinet, in order to bind future cabinets. Although his statement was criticized on August 22 by the new LDP Secretary General Hiroshi Mitsuzuka as exceeding the content of the Diet solution, the incoming LDP President (and soon to be prime minister) Ryutaro Hashimoto stated his own interpretation of the war was in accordance with Murayama's statement.  The Statement  The English translation of the Statement is as follows: > \\"The world has seen fifty years elapse since the war came to an end. Now, > when I remember the many people both at home and abroad who fell victim to > war, my heart is overwhelmed by a flood of emotions. The peace and > prosperity of today were built as Japan overcame great difficulty to arise > from a devastated land after defeat in the war. That achievement is > something of which we are proud, and let me herein express my heartfelt > admiration for the wisdom and untiring effort of each and every one of our > citizens. Let me also express once again my profound gratitude for the > indispensable support and assistance extended to Japan by the countries of > the world, beginning with the United States of America. I am also delighted > that we have been able to build the friendly relations which we enjoy today > with the neighboring countries of the Asia-Pacific region, the United States > and the countries of Europe. Now that Japan has come to enjoy peace and > abundance, we tend to overlook the pricelessness and blessings of peace. Our > task is to convey to younger generations the horrors of war, so that we > never repeat the errors in our history. I believe that, as we join hands, > especially with the peoples of neighboring countries, to ensure true peace > in the Asia-Pacific region -indeed, in the entire world- it is necessary, > more than anything else, that we foster relations with all countries based > on deep understanding and trust. Guided by this conviction, the Government > has launched the Peace, Friendship and Exchange Initiative, which consists > of two parts promoting: support for historical research into relations in > the modern era between Japan and the neighboring countries of Asia and > elsewhere; and rapid expansion of exchanges with those countries. > Furthermore, I will continue in all sincerity to do my utmost in efforts > being made on the issues arisen from the war, in order to further strengthen > the relations of trust between Japan and those countries. Now, upon this > historic occasion of the 50th anniversary of the war's end, we should bear > in mind that we must look into the past to learn from the lessons of > history, and ensure that we do not stray from the path to the peace and > prosperity of human society in the future. During a certain period in the > not too distant past, Japan, following a mistaken national policy, advanced > along the road to war, only to ensnare the Japanese people in a fateful > crisis, and, through its colonial rule and aggression, caused tremendous > damage and suffering to the people of many countries, particularly to those > of Asian nations. In the hope that no such mistake be made in the future, I > regard, in a spirit of humility, these irrefutable facts of history, and > express here once again my feelings of deep remorse and state my heartfelt > apology. Allow me also to express my feelings of profound mourning for all > victims, both at home and abroad, of that history. Building from our deep > remorse on this occasion of the 50th anniversary of the end of the war, > Japan must eliminate self-righteous nationalism, promote international > coordination as a responsible member of the international community and, > thereby, advance the principles of peace and democracy. At the same time, as > the only country to have experienced the devastation of atomic bombing, > Japan, with a view to the ultimate elimination of nuclear weapons, must > actively strive to further global disarmament in areas such as the > strengthening of the nuclear non-proliferation regime. It is my conviction > that in this way alone can Japan atone for its past and lay to rest the > spirits of those who perished. It is said that one can rely on good faith. > And so, at this time of remembrance, I declare to the people of Japan and > abroad my intention to make good faith the foundation of our Government > policy, and this is my vow.\\"  Reactions to the Statement  = Japan = The majority of the Japanese population was greatly supportive of Murayama's statement. Although some were concerned over indiscretions such as by Yoshinobu Shimamura, and feared that Murayama's apology may not necessarily hold if more conservative prime ministers followed to lead Japan. However, many were encouraged when Emperor Akihito spoke in a ritual said that marked the anniversary to reinforce Murayama's apology and expressed deep remorse for Japan's actions as well as mourning for those who suffered in the battlefield. Although the statement was met with general approval from the Japanese public who said they believed expressions of remorse were long overdue, some were cautious of Murayama's words. Some believed that there was no need for an apology, due to what they perceived as insufficient evidence for Japan's actions during World War II. There were occasional beliefs that politicians were apologizing purely for the sake of maintaining and improving diplomatic relations without making investigations. The Education Minister at the time, Yoshinobu Shimamura, told reporters he was unsure whether repeated apologies were useful and that Japan had not necessarily been the aggressor in the war. However, he quickly apologized and retracted his comments after meeting protests from the public population and other Asian countries. = South Korea = The perceptions of the South Koreans grew suspicious about the credibility of the statement as the means of reconciliation were not ensured in concrete measures, neither did they feel that it was met. The Asian Women‚Äôs Fund, which was created in spirit of the statement, was later rejected by South Korean comfort women and the South Korean government. They argued for direct compensation from the Japanese government. The Korean elites, additionally, required the Japanese government to declare, hence, acknowledging that there was a forced annexation in 1910. The Japanese did not comply to this demand. Therefore, South Koreans perceive inconsistency with the Japanese government. After normalizing diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea in 1965, Korean victims could legally not make individual claims against the Japanese government nor the Japanese companies. It strengthens the idea of Japan not being committed to making a genuine reconciliation. Visits at the Yasukuni Shrine by Junichiro Koizumi during his time in office (April 26, 2001 - September 26, 2006) and retracting statements by PM Shinzo Abe have continued the negative sentiments among the South Korean public. A survey conducted by the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in 2012 shows that the South Korean public are unaware of the Murayama Statement and misunderstood it to be related to the Dokdo-Takeshima Island dispute. The study concluded that the island dispute is considered as ‚Äúthe biggest obstacle in mending South Korean-Japan relations‚Äù. Since the Japanese government has made several statements about the dispute instead of concessions in the negotiations over the territory, there is continued suspicion about Japan‚Äôs actions. = China = Murayama was known as the first Japanese prime minister to apologize to China, and also the first to formally address Japan's actions during its colonial rule. According to Chinese media, As the \\"good friend (Â•ΩÊúãÂèã, hao peng you)\\" of Chinese people, Murayama's actions were praised by Asian countries, including China. Murayama's visits to China following the issue of this statement was often met with Chinese leaders mentioning the statement and praise Murayama for acting to improve Japanese- Chinese relations. Even after his resignation, Murayama has been invited to ceremonies in China to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II. In a statement released by People's Daily, Murayama emphasized the two nations' linguistic and cultural similarities, insisting that China and Japan develop a strong bond. = Other Nations = Although some Western nations such as Australia showed warmth and welcome towards the first explicit apology for Japan's imperialist and war time actions, other Asian countries such as Singapore and Malaysia expressed similar reactions to China and South Korea. Reactions were generally subdued compared to Western states, and not all Asian states issued official responses to the Murayama statement. However, in contrast to China and South Korea, Japan seems to have achieved a fair level of reconciliation with Taiwan and other Southeast Asian nations through the statement, that seem to have developed a \\"Forgive, but never forget\\" attitude.  Actions by Succeeding Prime Ministers in Japan  228x228px = The Koizumi Statement (2005) = Former PM Junichiro Koizumi issued an additional statement on August 5th 2005 regarding Japan's 20th century militarism during his time in office from 2001 to 2006. Nations such as China and South Korea repeatedly warned that attempts to avoid explicit apologies that would jeopardize diplomatic ties. In the statement he says: > ‚Äú[I]n the past, Japan, through its colonial rule and aggression, caused > tremendous damage and suffering to the people of many countries, > particularly to those of Asian nations. Sincerely facing these facts of > history, I once again express my feelings of deep remorse and heartfelt > apology, and also express the feelings of mourning for all victims, both at > home and abroad, in the war. I am determined not to allow the lessons of > that horrible war to erode, and to contribute to the peace and prosperity of > the world without ever again waging a war...‚Äù The Koizumi statement also mentions words such as \\"colonial rule\\", \\"aggression\\" and \\"deep remorse\\" but Koizumi's visits to Yasukuni Shrine, which honors 2.5 million Japanese war dead, including 14 Class A war criminals, worsening ties with Beijing and Seoul. = The Abe Statement (2015) = In the summer of 2015, PM Shinzo Abe signaled his government‚Äôs position that the wording of the Murayama Statement could be altered. Doing so would require a Cabinet decision. Abe said that he planned to uphold the general content of statements made by previous Japanese cabinets. He said the upcoming statement will include three main points: an expression of remorse for Japan‚Äôs wartime aggression, comments on the democratic path taken by the country over the last 70 years, and the government‚Äôs plans for the future, including measures to improve regional and global prosperity. The Murayama Statement said the country had caused ‚Äútremendous damage and suffering‚Äù to the people of Asia and other countries through its colonial rule and aggression. Abe seemed reluctant about using the same wording that appeared in the Murayama statement, saying he wanted to avoid ‚Äúbits and pieces of argument over whether the previous wording was used or new wording was added‚Äù. His comments on the issue drew criticism from many opposition leaders. Katsuya Okada, leader of the opposition Democratic Party of Japan, severely criticized Abe‚Äôs approach, saying that the prime minister‚Äôs remarks calling colonial rule and aggression ‚Äòbits and pieces‚Äô could not be tolerated, and that the original statement had already received strong international recognition. Kenji Eda, leader of Ishin no To (Japanese Innovation Party), warned Abe against altering the wording of the Murayama statement, saying doing so would ‚Äúsend a different message to neighboring countries‚Äù. Japanese Communist Party chairman Kazuo Shii also urged Abe to retain key aspects of the Murayama Statement and take appropriate action. In addition to this, Natsuo Yamaguchi, the leader of the junior Komeito party in Abe‚Äôs LDP-led coalition, said that the form of expression used in the Murayama Statement had significant meaning, thus any new statement must be capable of sending a similar message. Abe delivered his statement on August 14, 2015 on the 70th anniversary of Japan's defeat in World War II, causing much controversy especially in China and South Korea. The Abe Statement is based on previous statements such as the Murayama Statement. However, it also consulted the report of a panel commission created to reconsider ‚Äúthe history of the 20th century and Japan‚Äôs role and the world order in the 21st century.‚Äù The fundamental purposes of the panel and Abe statement were to design the view of 21st century, in the context of Japan‚Äôs aim of reconciliation and international contributions in the 70 years since World War II.  Reactions  Abe's speech for Japan's role in World War II China's state media criticized Abe's remarks as refraining from offering his own apology, this being agreed on by both the official broadcaster CCTV and Xinhua News Agency. South Korea criticized it as \\"disappointing\\", followed by comments from other Asian states as well, for example Taiwan calling on the Japanese government to examine its wartime aggression and learn the lessons of history. Abe‚Äôs words about the end of Japan‚Äôs ‚Äúapology‚Äù and that Abe's generation must not let the next generations ‚Äúbe predestined to apologize\\", was regarded unsatisfactory by those believing the Japanese should apologize for generations for the ‚Äúsin of Japanese ethnicity.‚Äù Former PM Tomiichi Murayama had responded to Abe's statement, two hours after it had been announced. He had accused Abe of using words from the Murayama statement and rewording it to create a more abstract version of the statement. While Abe used words such as \\"aggression\\" in his statement, he did not mention about the specific behaviors of Japan during the war, nor did he address whom his statement was for. He stood by the statement and urged Abe Shinzo to do the same. The concern over the statement's wording was combined with the Japanese Foreign Ministry deleting a \\"History Issues Q&A;\\" section on its website. The section was based on statements by Tomiichi Murayama and Junichiro Koizumi, but the section had been slightly altered when it was reinstated on the website on September 18th. The new version of the Q&A; is also criticized for playing down Abe's revisionist position on war related issues in order to facilitate the passage of the upcoming changes in the controversial security legislation.

In the Muppets version, Kermit begins by lamenting his green coloration, expressing that green \\"blends in with so many ordinary things\\" and wishing to be some other color. But by the end of the song, Kermit recalls positive associations with the color green, and concludes by accepting and embracing his greenness.

Lettering is considered an art form, where each letter in a phrase or quote acts as an illustration. Each letter is created with attention to detail and has a unique role within a composition., Lettering is created as an image, with letters that are meant to be used in a unique configuration. Lettering words do not usually translate into alphabets that can later be used in font since they are created with a specific word in mind. , Examples Lettering includes that used for purposes of blueprints and comic books, as well as decorative lettering such as sign painting and custom graphics. For instance; on posters, for a letterhead or business wordmark, lettering in stone, lettering for advertisements, tire lettering, fileteado, graffiti, or on chalkboards. Lettering may be drawn, applied using stencils, or using a digital medium with a stylus, or a vector program. Lettering that was not created using digital tools is commonly referred to as hand-lettering. Brush lettering practice by artist Emmanuel Sevilla. In the past, almost all decorative lettering other than that on paper was created as custom or hand- painted lettering. The use of fonts in place of lettering has increased due to new printing methods, phototypesetting, and digital typesetting, which allow fonts to be printed at any desired size. Lettering has been particularly important in Islamic art, due to the Islamic practice of avoiding depictions of sentient beings generally and of Muhammad in particular, and instead using representations in the form of Islamic calligraphy, including hilyes, or artforms based on written descriptions of Muhammed. More recently, there has been an influx of aspiring artists attempting hand-lettering with brush pens and digital mediums. Some popular styles are sans serif, serif, cursive/script, vintage, gothic/blackletter calligraphy, graffiti, and creative lettering. Several hand-lettering communities have formed, aggregating on sites such as Reddit.,, Some creators sell their lettering projects, and others create Instagram accounts dedicated to the sharing of their lettering. ,,  Related artforms  Lettering can be confused with similar terms, such as calligraphy or typography. Several pages have taken to distinguish the three in comprehensive guides. Calligraphy is known as a more rigid process, that requires learning the shapes of letters and combining thick downstrokes with thin upstrokes. This style of writing is generally created with dip pens and inks. Some calligraphers and hand-letterers say that calligraphy created with brush pens becomes lettering or faux-calligraphy ,, but others believe that the approach used to create the letters is more important than the tools used to do so. , Typography is referred to as the use of type in a repeating system, where each instance of the same letter looks the same. Part of the reason why these misconceptions are common is that some font shops categorize their fonts as \\"hand-lettered\\", \\"illustrated\\" or \\"calligraphy\\". Said fonts can begin with a hand-lettered alphabet that is then digitized and turned into a repeatable system. This identifies them as typography, instead of lettering. Hand Lettering for Beginners defines the three terms as follows: Lettering is the art of drawing letters, calligraphy is the art of writing letters, and typography is the art of using letters.

The Morning Oregonian, p. 9. Oregon In August 1851, Marquam moved to Portland, Oregon, then a small town of under 1,000 inhabitants. For many years he was the largest landowner in Multnomah County, Oregon, counting among his holdings Portland's Fulton District and his homestead on Marquam Hill in southwest Portland. The hill was part of a donation land claim he purchased for $2,500 in 1857 from John Donner, brother of George Donner of the ill-fated Donner Party. The hill is now the site of the Oregon Health & Science University and the Portland Veterans Affairs Medical Center. In 1862, he was elected Multnomah County judge. He served eight years in the position, having been re-elected to a second four-year term in 1866. In 1882, Marquam was elected as a Republican to the Oregon House of Representatives from Multnomah County.Oregon Legislative Assembly (12th) 1882 Regular Session Marquam gained a reputation as a transportation advocate and developer. He was instrumental in the formation of the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company in 1887. He built the Marquam Grand Opera House in Portland, later renamed the Orpheum Theater. The theater was torn down in the 1970s. It was located in the downtown Portland block bounded by Broadway, Alder, 6th and Morrison streets, which block was owned by Marquam. In the south half of the same block he built an eight-story office building, the Marquam Building, completed around 1892, next to his home, a small house at the southeast corner of the block.

The Kiowa and the Comanche played a minor role in actions that occurred in the southern part of the Territory along the Arkansas River.Bertbrong, Donald J. (1963), The Southern Cheyenne, Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, p. 199 The Cheyenne, Arapaho, and Sioux played the major role in actions that occurred north of the Arkansas River and along the South Platte River, the Great Platte River Road, and the eastern portion of the Overland Trail. The United States government and Colorado Territory authorities participated through the 1st Colorado Cavalry Regiment, often called the Colorado volunteers. The war was centered on the Colorado Eastern Plains, extending eastward into Kansas and Nebraska. The war included an attack in November 1864 against the winter camp of the Southern Cheyenne Chief Black Kettle known as the Sand Creek massacre. The engagement, initially hailed as a great victory, was later publicly condemned as an act of genocidal brutality. The massacre resulted in military and congressional hearings which established the culpability of John M. Chivington, the commander of the Colorado Volunteers, and his troops. The Indians' response to the Sand Creek Massacre was a move northward to the more isolated lands of Wyoming to join their relatives, the Northern Cheyenne, the Northern Arapaho, and the main body of the Sioux. En route they carried out extensive raids along the South Platte River and attacked U.S. military forts and forces, successfully eluding defeat and capture by the U.S. army. Background Indian land as defined by the Treaty of Fort Laramie By the terms of the 1851 Treaty of Fort Laramie between the United States and various tribes including the Cheyenne and Arapaho,\\"Treaty of Fort Laramie with Sioux, Etc., 1851.\\" 11 Stats. 749, Sept. 17, 1851. the United States unilaterally defined and recognized Cheyenne and Arapaho territory as ranging from the North Platte River in present-day Wyoming and Nebraska southward to the Arkansas River in present day Colorado and Kansas. The treaty also acknowledged that the tribal territories defined therein were minimum territories and that it didn't preclude the existence of additional tribal territories not mentioned in the treaty. The treaty did not - as is often falsely assumed - \\"allocate territory\\" to various tribes but merely endeavoured to make declaratory delineations of already existing sovereign tribal lands through which the US merely secured a right of way. Initially, the land, often called \\"the Great American Desert,\\" was of little interest to the United States and white settlers. However, the discovery in November 1858 of gold in the Rocky Mountains in ColoradoHoig 1980, p. 61. (then part of the western Kansas Territory)Greene 2004, p. 12. brought on a gold rush and a consequent flood of white emigration across Cheyenne and Arapaho lands. Colorado territorial officials pressured federal authorities to redefine and reduce the extent of Indian treaty lands.Greene 2004, p. 27 On February 18, 1861, six chiefs of the Southern Cheyenne and four of the Arapaho signed the Treaty of Fort Wise with the United States\\"Treaty with the Arapaho and Cheyenne, 1861\\" (Treaty of Fort Wise). 12 Stat. 1163, p. 810. at Bent's New Fort at Big Timbers near what is now Lamar, Colorado. They ceded more than 90 percent of the lands designated for them by the Fort Laramie Treaty.Greene, 2004, p. 27 Their new, much reduced reserve was located in eastern Colorado. Some Cheyenne including the Dog Soldiers, a militaristic band of Cheyennes and Lakotas that had evolved beginning in the 1830s, disavowed the treaty and refused to abide by its constraints.Greene 2004, pp. 12-13. They continued to live and hunt in the bison-rich lands of eastern Colorado and western Kansas, becoming increasingly belligerent over the tide of white immigration across their lands.Hoig 1980, p. 62. Cheyennes opposed to the treaty said that it had been signed by a small minority of the chiefs without the consent or approval of the rest of the tribe, that the signatories had not understood what they signed, and that they had been bribed to sign by a large distribution of gifts. The whites, however, claimed the treaty was a \\"solemn obligation\\" and considered that those Indians who refused to abide by it were hostile and planning a war.Hyde 1968, p. 118. Opening shots Painting of a Cheyenne scout In March 1864, there was little indication that an Indian War in Colorado was about to begin. The U.S. army was planning to withdraw many of its units from the Great Plains to fight the Confederacy in the Civil War. On April 9, however, Colonel John Chivington, commander of the Colorado volunteers, reported that Indians had stolen 175 head of cattle from whites. The Cheyenne later stated that they found cattle wandering freely on the plains and took them to their camps. Lt. George Eayre with soldiers and a howitzer was despatched to recover the cattle. On April 12, Eayre encountered a band of Cheyenne. A fight ensued in which a soldier was killed. Eayre burned the seventy tipis of a nearby encampment and returned to Denver with 20 head of cattle. This fight took place near the headwaters of the Republican River.Grinnell, George Bird (1955), The Fighting Cheyennes, Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, pp. 116-119 On about the same date, a band of fourteen Dog Soldiers encountered a group of fifteen to twenty soldiers just north of the South Platte River. The soldiers demanded that the Dog Soldiers throw down their weapons. The soldiers suspected the Dog Soldiers had stolen four mules from a white owner. A fight ensued and two soldiers were killed and three Dog Soldiers wounded.Halaas, David Fridtjof and Masich, Andrew E. (2004), Halfbreed: The Remarkable True Story of George Bent, Cambridge, MA: Da Capo Press, pp. 113-115 The mixed blood Cheyenne warrior, George Bent, said that the Indians were puzzled by what they regarded as unprovoked attacks by soldiers. Bent speculated that the altercations between soldiers and Indians were an effort by Colonel Chivington and the Colorado Volunteers to avoid being ordered to go to Kansas to fight the Confederates by establishing a need for them to remain in Colorado because of an Indian war.Hyde, George E., ed. Savoie Lottinville (1968), Life of George Bent, Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, p. 127 The war expands Incidents continue to happen regularly, sparked by both the Indians and U.S. soldiers and militia. In May Lt. Eayre was in the field again with 100 men and 2 howitzers. Near the Smoky Hill River in Kansas Eayre had a battle with the Dog Soldiers. He claimed the Indians started the battle; the Indians claimed the soldiers attacked them. Eayre claimed that he killed 28 Indians at a loss of four men of his own. Bent claimed that only three Indians were killed, but among the Indian dead was Lean Bear, a prominent Dog Soldier leader.The War of the Rebellion, Series 1, Vol XXXIV, Part One, p. 935 Hyde, p. 132\\"The Sand Creek Massacre,\\" , accessed 29 Aug 2019 Eayre finished his raid at Fort Larned, near present Larned, Kansas, where 240 of his horses and mules were stolen by the Kiowa. Arapahoes offering assistance to recover the stolen horses were fired on by soldiers and thereafter turned hostile.Grinnell, p. 125 Also, in May, Major Jacob Downing and a force of Colorado volunteers attacked a Cheyenne village in Cedar Canyon north of the South Platte River. The people in the village were mainly old women and children. Downing reported killing 26 Indians. One soldier was killed.Grinnell, p. 122 On June 11, only from Denver, four Arapaho killed the four members of the Hungate family, creating fear in the city that the war was on their doorstep.\\"The Hungate Massacre,\\" , accessed 2 Sep 2019 On July 12, a band of Miniconjou Sioux attacked a wagon train on the Oregon Trail, killing 4 men. Soldiers pursued the raiders but were ambushed and had one man killed. On August 20, Indians killed 5 members of a family in Nebraska. A total of 51 people were reported killed by Indians along the Little Blue River in Kansas and Nebraska. The roads to Denver across the Great Plains were closed from August 15 to September 24.McDermott, John D. (2003), Circle of Fire: The Indian War of 1865, Mechanicsburg, PA: Stackpole Books, pp. 12-13 Soldiers from Kansas also got involved in the war. On September 25, Major General James G. Blunt with 400 soldiers and Delaware Indian scouts encountered Cheyennes on the Pawnee Fork of the Arkansas River. Blunt claimed to have killed 9 Indians at the cost of two dead soldiers. Peace feelers Camp Weld Conference, September 28, 1864, with the Cheyenne and Arapaho. Major Wynkoop is kneeling left. Black Kettle is third from the left in the middle row. In July 1864, Colorado governor John Evans sent a circular to the Plains Indians, inviting those who were friendly to go to a place of safety at Fort Lyon (near present Lamar, Colorado) on the eastern plains, where their people would be given provisions and protection by the United States troops. A substantial number of the Indians desired peace, while the Dog Soldiers pursued war. On August 29, 1864, the two mixed-blood Cheyennes, George Bent and Edmund Guerrier, wrote letters on behalf of \\"Black Kettle and Other Chiefs\\" offering to make peace and return seven white prisoners in exchange for Indian prisoners held by the whites. In response, Major Edward W. Wynkoop, the commander of Fort Lyon (near present-day Lamar, Colorado) led a force of 130 men to try to recover the prisoners. They were met by a band of 600 or more Cheyenne warriors on the Smoky Hill River. In talks with Black Kettle and others, Wynkoop invited the chiefs to visit Denver to meet with the governor, John Evans, and Colonel Chivington. The meetings at Camp Weld ended with Black Kettle and the other chiefs apparently believing that they had made peace with the whites. On their return to Fort Lyon, Wynkoop promised the peaceful Indians protection if they established a village on Sand Creek, northeast of Fort Lyon, and within the area allocated to the Cheyenne and Arapaho by the Treaty of Fort Wise. Black Kettle and his followers moved to Sand Creek. On October 17, however, Wynkoop was relieved of his command by Chivington, apparently because of his advocacy for a peaceful settlement of the war.Grinnell, pp. 135-142 The desire for peace by Black Kettle and others to the contrary, the Dog Soldiers and other hostile Indians continued to raid ranches and wagon trains and to clash with soldiers during the fall, especially in Kansas and Nebraska. Several offensives by the U.S. army were ineffective. Sand Creek massacre Colonel John M. Chivington On November 29, 1864, 675 men mostly belonging to the Colorado Volunteers led by Colonel John M. Chivington, crossed into Cheyenne and Arapaho territory in lands allocated to the Cheyenne and Arapaho by the Treaty of Fort Wise. The soldiers sacked the village of Black Kettle, over which flew both an American flag and a white flag of truce, and killed about 150 Indians, mostly unarmed women, children, and the elderly. There were no Dog Soldiers nor other hostile Indians in the village at the time of Chivington's attack.Smiley, B. \\"Sand Creek Massacre\\", Archaeology magazine. Archaeological Institute of America. Retrieved February 8, 2010. Indian retaliation Spotted Tail, the Brul√© Sioux leader After the Sand Creek massacre, according to George Bent, the Cheyenne, Northern Arapaho, and the Brul√© and Oglala sub-tribes of the Lakota met about January 1, 1865 on Cherry Creek in present-day Cheyenne County, Kansas. They agreed on war with the whites and decided to attack Camp Rankin and the nearby settlement of Julesburg, Colorado. The Sioux, the first to agree to war, had the honor of leading a column of possibly 1,000 warriors and an additional 3,000 women and children. After the attack on Julesburg, the Indians planned to march northward and join their relatives in Wyoming.Hyde, pp. 164-168. The Southern Arapaho had moved south of the Arkansas River and joined the Kiowa and the Comanche. Julesburg consisted of a stagecoach station, stables, an express and telegraph office, a warehouse, and a large store that catered to travelers going to Denver along the South Platte. Its population was about 50 armed men. One mile west was Camp Rankin, with one company, about 60 men, of cavalry. High sod walls surrounded both settlements. On January 7, 1,000 warriors attacked Julesburg and Camp Rankin killing 14 soldiers and four armed civilians at little or no loss to themselves. The surviving soldiers and civilians took refuge inside Camp Rankin while the Indians plundered the settlement.Robrock, David P. \\"The Seventh Iowa Cavalry and the Plains Indians Wars.\\" Montana: The Magazine of Western History.

History of Wyoming, pp. 422‚Äì433. https://archive.org/details/historyofwyoming00cout, accessed 8 Mar 2012 Not all the Indians were committed to war. After the raid, Black Kettle and 80 lodges of his followers (perhaps 100 men and their families) left the main body and joined the Kiowa and Comanche south of the Arkansas River. Many of the Southern Arapaho likewise had moved south of the Arkansas.Hyde, p. 177 From January 28 to February 2, the Indians embarked on a great raid along the valley of the South Platte River. The Cheyenne raided west of Julesburg, the Northern Arapaho near Julesburg, and the Sioux east of Julesburg, destroying a dozen or more ranches and stagecoach stations along of the river valley and accumulating a large herd of captured cattle. Near Valley Station (present day Sterling, Colorado), the Cheyenne had a brush with soldiers. Illustrating the difference in accounts between soldiers and Indians, Lt. J. J. Kennedy said that his force had a battle with the raiders and killed 10 to 20 Indians and recovered 400 stolen cattle. George Bent said it was a minor skirmish in which no Indians were killed or wounded and the only cattle the soldiers recovered were the ones the Indians had abandoned as too poor to steal. During the raid, the Cheyenne encountered a group of nine former soldiers. They killed all nine of them and discovered two Cheyenne scalps in their luggage from the Sand Creek massacre. Although soldiers and ranchers claimed to have inflicted heavy casualties on the raiders, Bent said he knew of only four Indians who were killed during the raids. Three were Sioux who were killed while attacking a wagon train and one was an Arapaho who was killed accidentally by a Cheyenne.Hyde, pp. 177-182McDermott, pp. 27-30 On February 2, the Indians left their large camp on the South Platte River and continued north toward the Powder River country of Wyoming to join their relatives there. The Sioux led the way as they were most familiar with the territory. En route the Indians had two more skirmishes in Nebraska with the U.S. army at Mud Springs and Rush Creek.McDermott, pp. 35-45 In subsequent months, the Indians frequently raided wagon trains and military establishments along the Oregon Trail in Wyoming. In the summer of 1865, the Indians launched a large-scale offensive in the Battle of Platte Bridge (present-day Casper, Wyoming) achieving a minor victory. Later that summer, the U.S. army invaded Indian territory in Wyoming with more than 2,000 soldiers in the ineffective Powder River Expedition.Grinnell, pp. 175-196 Aftermath Edmond Guerrier was the son of Frenchman William Guerrier and Walks In Sight, a Cheyenne. A survivor of the Sand Creek massacre, Guerrier testified to Congressional investigators at Fort Riley, Kansas in 1865 about the massacre. Mixed blood Cheyenne warrior George Bent and his wife, Magpie. Bent was a survivor of the Sand Creek massacre. Historian John D. McDermott said that the Colorado War was the last time the Northern and Southern Cheyennes and Arapahos and the Brul√© Sioux were united to effectively resist the tide of white settlers and soldiers traveling through and settling on what had formerly been their lands. \\"Never again would the Sioux and their allies take the offensive as they did at Julesburg, Mud Springs, Rush Springs,\\" and other battles of the Colorado War. Thereafter, the battles between Indians and whites \\"would become more reactive, rather than active, meant to defend a homeland rather than punish a perpetrator\\" as the Indian reaction to the Sand Creek massacre was intended to be.McDermott, pp. 168-169 By December 1865, the Colorado War had fizzled out. Most of the Southern Cheyenne and Arapaho who had journeyed north to Wyoming had returned to the southern Great Plains. The Brul√© Sioux under Spotted Tail who had been allies of the Cheyenne and Arapaho had peacefully settled near Fort Laramie.McDermott, pp. 168-169\\"Brule Sioux Chief Spotted Tail,\\" , accessed 5 Sep 2019 Black Kettle, always seeking peace, signed the Little Arkansas Treaty in October 1865 obligating his band of Southern Cheyenne to move to Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma). \\"Cheyenne Chief Black Kettle,\\" , accessed 5 Sep 2019 Roman Nose and the Dog Soldiers continued to be hostile and to raid and fight the U.S. army in Kansas and Colorado.\\"Cheyenne Dog Soldiers,\\" , accessed 5 Sep 2019 The two mixed-blood Cheyennes, George Bent and Edmund Guerrier, also returned to the southern plains. Bent became an interpreter between the Cheyenne and the whites and, through a series of letters to scholar George Hyde, a historian of the Colorado War and the Cheyenne.Halaas and Masich, p. 349 Guerrier worked for a time as a scout for George Armstrong Custer in campaigns against his Cheyenne relatives and as an interpreter for many interactions between the tribe and the United States. Guerrier married Julia Bent, sister of George Bent and also a survivor of the Sand Creek massacre.Hardorff, Richard G., compiler & editor (2006). Washita Memories: Eyewitness Views of Custer's Attack on Black Kettle's Village, Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma Press, pp. 50-51, 221-222 Investigations of Sand Creek massacre In 1865, the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War investigated the Sand Creek massacre and concluded the following: \\"the truth is that he [Col. Chivington] surprised and murdered, in cold blood, the unsuspecting men, women, and children on Sand creek, who had every reason to believe they were under the protection of the United States authorities, and then returned to Denver and boasted of the brave deed he and the men under his command had performed.\\";United States Congress Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War, 1865, p. V, , accessed 6 Sep 2019 Another congressional committee, the Joint Special Committee on Conditions of Indian Tribes, also investigated the Sand Creek massacre in 1865 as part of a larger review of U.S.-Native American affairs across the country and territories. Of the five conclusions outlined in their report, the first linked the ongoing conflicts with Indigenous Peoples directly to the actions of \\"lawless white men.\\" A group of legislators from the committee visited Fort Lyon in 1865 and told tribe members there that the government disapproved of Chivington's actions. Chivington had already resigned his military commission and thus was not prosecuted for the massacre. After Sand Creek, Chivington changed residences frequently and was involved in several scandals.McDermott, pp. 174-176 He defended his actions at Sand Creek until the end of his life in 1894.\\"Placing Blame: The 1864 battle of Sand Creek is still ripe for debate\\" (May 1, 2004), True West Magazine, , accessed 6 Sep 2019 The Methodist Church, of which he was a lay preacher, apologized for his actions in 1996 and a street named after him in Longmont, Colorado was renamed in 2005.\\"Sand Creek Massacre research center supported\\"Hughes, Trevor (December 29, 2004), \\"Council: So long Chivington\\", Longmont Times-Call, retrieved April 17, 2011 See also *Red Cloud's War * Colorado in the American Civil War * Sand Creek Massacre * Battle of Julesburg * Battle of Mud Springs * Battle of Rush Creek * Battle of Platte Bridge * Powder River Expedition * Battle of the Tongue River * Raid on Godfrey Ranch * Sawyers Fight Citations References *Atlas of Colorado, Kenneth A.

The behaviours in an ethogram are usually defined to be mutually exclusive and objective, avoiding subjectivity and functional inference as to their possible purpose. For example, a species may use a putative threat display, which in the ethogram is given a descriptive name such as \\"head forward\\" or \\"chest-beating display\\", and not \\"head forward threat\\" or \\"chest-beating threat\\". This degree of objectivity is required because what looks like \\"courtship\\" might have a completely different function, and in addition, the same motor patterns in different species can have very different functions (e.g. tail wagging in cats and dogs). Objectivity and clarity in the definitions of behaviours also improve inter- observer reliability. Often, ethograms are hierarchical in presentation. The defined behaviours are recorded under broader categories of behaviour which may allow functional inference such that \\"head forward\\" is recorded under \\"Aggression\\". In ethograms of social behaviour, the ethogram may also indicate the \\"Giver\\" and \\"Receiver\\" of activities. Sometimes, the definition of a behaviour in an ethogram may have arbitrary components. For example, \\"Stereotyped licking\\" might be defined as \\"licking the bars of the cage more than 5 times in 30 seconds\\". The definition may be arguable, but if it is stated clearly, it fulfils the requirements of scientific repeatability and clarity of reporting and data recording. Some ethograms are given in pictorial form and not only catalogue the behaviours but indicate the frequency of their occurrence and the probability that one behaviour follows another. This probability can be indicated numerically or by the thickness of an arrow connecting the two behaviours. Sometimes the proportion of time that each behaviour occupies can be represented in a pie chart or bar chart Animal welfare science Ethograms are used extensively in the study of welfare science. Ethograms can be used to detect the occurrence or prevalence of abnormal behaviours (e.g. stereotypies, feather pecking, tail-biting), normal behaviours (e.g. comfort behaviours), departures from the ethogram of ancestral species and the behaviour of captive animals upon release into a natural environment. Reactions of animals to human presence Ethograms have also been applied to research concerning the behavioural response of animals to the presence of humans. For example, it has been used to analyze the reactions of black bears and baboons to humans.

Elevated PAI-1 is a risk factor for thrombosis and atherosclerosis PAI-1 is a serine protease inhibitor (serpin) that functions as the principal inhibitor of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and urokinase (uPA), the activators of plasminogen and hence fibrinolysis (the physiological breakdown of blood clots). It is a serine protease inhibitor (serpin) protein (SERPINE1). The other PAI, plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 (PAI-2) is secreted by the placenta and only present in significant amounts during pregnancy. In addition, protease nexin acts as an inhibitor of tPA and urokinase. PAI-1, however, is the main inhibitor of the plasminogen activators. Genetics The PAI-1 gene is SERPINE1, located on chromosome 7 (7q21.3-q22). There is a common polymorphism known as 4G/5G in the promoter region. The 5G allele is slightly less transcriptionally active than the 4G.  Function  PAI-1's main function entails the inhibition of urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), an enzyme responsible for the cleavage of plasminogen to form plasmin. Plasmin mediates the degradation of the extracellular matrix either by itself or in conjunction with matrix metalloproteinases. In this scenario, PAI-1 inhibits uPA via active site binding, preventing the formation of plasmin. Additional inhibition is mediated by PAI-1 binding to the uPA/uPA receptor complex, resulting in the latter's degradation. Thus, PAI can be said to inhibit the serine proteases tPA and uPA/urokinase, and hence is an inhibitor of fibrinolysis, the physiological process that degrades blood clots. In addition, PAI-1 inhibits the activity of matrix metalloproteinases, which play a crucial role in invasion of malignant cells through the basal lamina. PAI-1 is mainly produced by the endothelium (cells lining blood vessels), but is also secreted by other tissue types, such as adipose tissue. Fibrinolysis (simplified). Blue arrows denote stimulation, and red arrows inhibition. Role in disease Congenital deficiency of PAI-1 has been reported; as fibrinolysis is not suppressed adequately, it leads to a hemorrhagic diathesis (a tendency to hemorrhage). PAI-1 is present in increased levels in various disease states (such as a number of forms of cancer), as well as in obesity and the metabolic syndrome. It has been linked to the increased occurrence of thrombosis in patients with these conditions. In inflammatory conditions in which fibrin is deposited in tissues, PAI-1 appears to play a significant role in the progression to fibrosis (pathological formation of connective tissue). Presumably, lower PAI levels would lead to less suppression of fibrinolysis and conversely a more rapid degradation of the fibrin. Angiotensin II increases synthesis of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, so it accelerates the development of atherosclerosis. Pharmacology * Tiplaxtinin (PAI-039) is a small molecule inhibitor that is being studied for use in the attenuation of remodeling of blood vessels, a result of arterial hypertension and activation of the renin‚Äìangiotensin system. * Annonacinone is a naturally occurring PAI-1 inhibitor found in plants of the Annonaceae family.

He was born on a farm in Gloucester Township, Canada West in an area now known as Glen Ogilvie to James Ogilvie of Belfast Ireland and Margaret Holliday Ogilvie of Peebles, Scotland. Ogilvie articled as a surveyor with Robert Sparks, qualifying to practice as a Provincial Land Surveyor in 1869. He married Sparks' sister Mary, a school teacher, on March 8, 1872. He worked locally as a land surveyor, qualified as a Dominion Land Surveyor in 1872 and was first hired by the Dominion government in 1875. He was responsible for numerous surveys from the 1870s to the 1890s, mainly in the Prairie Provinces. From 1887 to 1889, Ogilvie was involved in George Mercer Dawson's exploration and survey expedition in what later became the Yukon Territory. He surveyed the Chilkoot Pass, the Yukon and Porcupine rivers. Ogilvie established the location of the boundary between the Yukon and Alaska on the 141st meridian west. \\"Governor\\" Ogilvie of Y.T. departing the beach at Nome During the Klondike Gold Rush, he surveyed the townsite of Dawson City and was responsible for settling many disputes between miners. Ogilvie became the Yukon's second Commissioner in 1898 at the height of the gold rush, and resigned because of ill-health in 1901. He was the author of Early Days on the Yukon (1913), which is still available in facsimile reprints. The Ogilvie Mountains, Ogilvie River and Ogilvie Aerodrome in the Northern Yukon Territory along with Ogilvie Valley in the Southern Yukon Territory are named after him.

The island is contained within the Maria Island National Park, which includes a marine area of off the island's northwest coast. The island is about in length from north to south and, at its widest, is about west to east. At its closest point, Point Lesueur, the island lies approximately off the east coast of Tasmania. Tasmanians pronounce the name , as did the early British settlers but the original pronunciation was . The island was named in 1642 by Dutch explorer Abel Tasman after Maria van Diemen (n√©e van Aelst), wife of Anthony van Diemen, the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies in Batavia. The island was known as Maria's Isle in the early 19th century. The locality of Maria Island is in the local government area of Glamorgan‚ÄìSpring Bay in the South-east region of Tasmania. Local community and economy The strait between Maria Island and the east coast of mainland Tasmania is called Mercury Passage and was named after HMS Mercury, commanded by John Henry Cox, who charted the area in 1789. There are two towns of size in this part of the east coast: Orford at the mouth of the Prosser River and Triabunna, some further north at the head of Spring Bay. The island's sole settlement is Darlington, near the northern tip of the island. Darlington has many old buildings and it has no permanent inhabitants other than a few park rangers. During the summer holiday period, up to several hundred tourists visit the island. Tourism is important to the local economy. In nearby Triabunna other major industries are fishing, forestry and agriculture. Rock lobster, scalefish, scallops and abalone are taken near the island by both commercial and recreational fishermen, and mussels are farmed in Mercury Passage. History =Aboriginal people= Maria Island has a rich history. Before the colonial era, Aboriginal people of the Tyreddeme band of the Oyster Bay tribe journeyed regularly to the island and much evidence of their presence remains, particularly around the bays on either side of the island's isthmus. In 1802 the French expedition led by Nicolas Baudin encountered the Aboriginal people of Maria Island, as did the whalers of the early 19th century. Ren√© Maug√©, the zoologist on Baudin's expedition, was buried on Point Maug√© on south Maria Island. =Convicts= Commissariat Store, Darlington. For two periods during the first half of the 19th century, Maria Island hosted convict settlements. The island's first convict era was between 1825 and 1832 and its second - the probation station era - between 1842 and 1851. Among those held during the second era was the Irish nationalist leader William Smith O'Brien, exiled for his part in the Young Irelander Rebellion of 1848. His cottage still exists in the nearby former penal colony Port Arthur to where he was deported after his time on Maria Island. He was later transferred to New Norfolk on the Derwent River upstream of Hobart. Three structures from the first convict era remain in the Darlington area: the Commissariat Store built in 1825 and presently used as the park's reception and visitor centre; the convict penitentiary, completed in 1828 and now used to accommodate visitors rather than detain them; and the convict-built dam on Bernacchis Creek, which still provides Darlington's water. =Industry and farming= Sealing was conducted on the island from at least 1805.Parry Kostoglou, Sealing in Tasmania; Historical Research Project, Parks and Wildlife Service, Hobart, 1996, p.70 Shore-based bay whaling was conducted in the 1830s and 1840s at four locations on the island: Darlington, Isle du Nord, Whalers Cove and Haunted Bay. In the 19th century, whaling ships sometimes anchored off shore and hunted for whales. From the 1880s, the Italian entrepreneur Diego Bernacchi set up island enterprises, including silk and wine production and a cement factory, quarrying limestone deposits at the Fossil Cliffs for the raw material. A substantial cement works was built at Darlington in the early 1920s, with a 2 ft gauge tramway linking the quarries to the cement works and a new jetty. At the height of its fortunes in the early 20th century, Darlington had hundreds of residents and several hotels. By July 1930, all of those ventures had failed for a number of reasons, including the Great Depression, poor quality limestone, and competition from mainland producers who were not burdened with high costs of transport. For a period of 40 years until the late 1960s, the island was dominated by farming. The South Island was farmed by John Robey, a South African, with his wife Hilda. Robey's Farm is located on the west side of the south island, and although essentially complete in a \\"just walked away\\" fashion as late as the early 1980s, the location has since been extensively vandalised, and the farmhouse further damaged by weather and neglect by the Parks and Wildlife Service. =National Park= The Tasmanian Government resumed all of the island's freehold land and established the national park, proclaimed in 1972 and extended in 1991, to include part of the surrounding sea. Tourists walking along Rutherford Beach north of the Painted Cliffs, Maria Island Environment Common wombat on Maria Island Cape Barren goose on Maria Island =Geography= Maria Island takes the form of a figure-eight, with the northern section of the island significantly larger than the southern. Both parts of the island have quite rugged relief and they are joined by a tombolo about long known as McRaes Isthmus. The highest point, Mount Maria, is in the northern part of the island and stands above sea level. Maria Island has been separated from nearby mainland Tasmania for some 3-4 thousand years.http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/indeX.aspX?base=2897 =Flora and fauna= Fourteen distinct terrestrial plant communities occur on the island, which is mostly clothed in various forms of eucalypt forest. Natural and historical clearings provide grazing for many animals, such as bare-nosed wombats (Vombatus ursinus) which occur in high quantities on the island and Tasmanian pademelons. Nearly all the island's animals are native to Tasmania although some, including eastern grey kangaroos, red-necked wallabies, and Cape Barren geese, were introduced during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Fallow deer were also introduced to the island and were present primarily in the French's Farm area, but sometimes wandered as far north as the small marsh behind Hopground Beach, just north of Rutherford Beach. Sheep were present until around 1981, escapes from prior sheep farming operations. Other animals include common brushtail, ringtail possums, short-beaked echidnas and three species of snake. Birds Maria Island has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports significant numbers of endangered swift parrots and forty-spotted pardalotes, over 1% of the world population of Pacific gulls, as well as populations of most of Tasmania's endemic bird species. Tasmanian devils In November 2012 captive Tasmanian devils were introduced to the island and are cared for by the Tasmania Parks and Wildlife Service staff who live on the island. These devils form part of the \\"insurance population\\" of devils unaffected by the devil facial tumour disease that is sweeping through mainland Tasmania's devil population. Tasmanian devils are sometimes seen by visitors.https://encountermaria.com.au/wildlife/https://gobehindthescenery.com.au/travel- tips/see-tassies-cute-and-cuddly-creatures/ There is some evidence that the devils are impacting on the bird life of the island. =Marine habitats= The marine section of the national park protects a representative area of Tasmanian East Coast marine habitat, and has significantly larger individuals and populations of key marine species than surrounding waters. This area is one of the most intensively studied marine protected areas in Australia and is popular with divers. The marine section of the park extends from an unnamed point north-east of Bishop and Clerk, westwards to Cape Boullanger and then southwards as far as Return Point. The marine boundary's definition varies, but it is never more than 1 km from Maria Island's low water mark. =Climate= Access =Transport= A ferry sails multiple times a day from the town of Triabunna to the jetty in Darlington Bay at the northern end of Maria Island, a distance by sea of 16 km or nearly nine nautical miles. In winter, some sailings are subject to demand, while in summer extra sailings are provided. A previous ferry operation out of Louisville (near Orford) is now defunct. Common dolphins, Australian fur seals and seabirds such as Australasian gannets and shy albatrosses are often seen on the voyage. Tourist flights to the island can be made from Cambridge Airport or Friendly Beaches. =Facilities= Very basic accommodation is available in Darlington in \\"the Penitentiary\\", a former place of internment, built during the first convict era. Bookings can be made with the Parks and Wildlife Service. There are ten rooms that have bunk beds with vinyl mattresses, a table and chairs, and a wood heater. Nine of the rooms sleep six people each, and the tenth sleeps fourteen people. All cooking gear, lighting, bedding and food must be brought to the island. There is no electricity or running water in the rooms, but toilets, hot showers, and barbecues are nearby. Many visitors also choose to camp in the camping area in Darlington - an advance booking is not necessary for this. =Activities and attractions= The Painted Cliffs Walking, bicycling, swimming, snorkelling, diving, bird watching, wildlife observation and relaxation are the main activities undertaken by visitors. Many people take interest in Maria Island's history, and most of the island's walks include sites of historic interest. The Painted Cliffs and the Fossil Cliffs are two popular walking destinations for day visitors, both on the island's coastline. The Painted Cliffs are sandstone with beautiful patterns formed through staining by iron oxide. The Fossil Cliffs are tall limestone cliffs containing prolific ancient fossils. Longer day walks include tracks that ascend Bishop and Clerk () and Mount Maria (). Mount Maria is a six- to seven- hour return walk from Darlington while Bishop and Clerk can be completed in about four hours return. Nearly all roads and tracks on the island are suitable for bicycling. Bicycles and helmets can be rented in Triabunna and brought over on the ferry. A bicycle is a must for those who want to see as much of the island as possible on a day trip. Bicycle-riding is not permitted on beaches or on the two mountain tracks. A vehicular track extends from Darlington south to Haunted Bay on south Maria Island, with a number of side- tracks and points of interest along the way. Haunted Bay is so named because of the constant calling in the evening of the many fairy penguins that live there. The track south is the usual route for people doing bike rides or multi-day walks. The major campsites outside Darlington are at Frenchs Farm, from Darlington, and Encampment Cove, a further away, which is also used by boating visitors. This area is referred to by boaters as Chinamans Bay (Chinamans is the bay just north of Encampment Cove). Both Frenchs Farm and Encampment Cove have rainwater tanks. The Frenchs Farm tank is less likely to run out during summer. Water can be hard to find elsewhere. From Encampment Cove it is only a little more than a walk to the ruins of Maria Island's second (probation-era) convict station at Point Lesueur on the island's west coast (also known as Long Point). Soldiers Beach and Bloodstone Beach on the western side of the island are also well worth the effort that it takes to reach them, as are Shoal Bay and Riedle Bay, the beaches either side of McRaes Isthmus. In 2007 a disused coastal trader, the Troy D, was scuttled outside the marine section of the national park, west-southwest of the Painted Cliffs, with the intention of creating a dive wreck.

At the same time, she was enrolled at the University of World Economy and Diplomacy (UWED) in Tashkent, where in 2001, was \\"awarded\\" a PhD in political science. Since 2009, she has held a chair of political science at the UWED. She also holds a Bachelor of Arts in telecommunications which she received in 2006, from Tashkent University of Informational Technologies. Career and activities =Political and diplomatic activities= Between summer 1995 and autumn 1997, she was Adviser to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Uzbekistan. During this time she helped on with organizing the Tashkent International Conference \\"Central Asia Nuclear-Weapon- Free-Zone\\" (CANWFZ). In 1998 and from 2000 to 2003, Karimova served as counselor at Uzbekistan's Mission to the United Nations in New York. From 2003 until 2005 she was minister-counselor at the Uzbek embassy in Moscow, and served as adviser to the minister of foreign affairs from 2005 to 2008. In February 2008, she was appointed deputy foreign minister for international cooperation in cultural and humanitarian affairs. In September of the same year, she was named Permanent Representative of Uzbekistan to the United Nations and other international organizations in Geneva and took up the post in December 2008. In January 2010, she was named Uzbek Ambassador to Spain. She is a member of the Cercle Diplomatique de Gen√®ve. In 2012, Karimova was honoured with the \\"Silk Road and Humanitarian Cooperation\\" Award of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. =Business interests= According to US diplomats in Uzbekistan, Karimova \\"bullied her way into gaining a slice of virtually every lucrative business\\" in the country and is viewed as a \\"robber baron\\". Karimova was believed to control Uzdunrobita, Uzbekistan's national mobile telephone network, as well as the country's healthcare, and media sectors. However, since June 2007 Uzdunrobita has been totally owned by Mobile TeleSystems OJSC (\\"MTS\\" NYSE: MBT), the largest mobile phone operator in Russia and the CIS. December 2009, the Swiss magazine \\"Bilanz\\" described Gulnora Karimova as one of the ten richest women in the country. In the interview to the Swiss economic magazine Bilan, Karimova denied her involvement into mentioned cases stating: \\"I have never considered the opportunities of doing business in Switzerland. ... These references are insinuations of my opponents. My name has been mentioned earlier several times in relations to companies such as Zeromax in Zug, Interspan, Oxus Gold, Wimm- Bill-Dann of Russia, Carlsberg and many others.\\" In March 2014, the Swiss Prosecutor's Office announced that it had extended a money laundering investigation to include Karimova. The probe, launched in 2012, had initially focused on four of Karimova's allies. Working though the Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative, the U.S. Department of Justice seized $850 million in 2016 that had been \\"funneled through corrupt deals\\" by Karimova. Karimova is also under investigation in Uzbekistan on charges of corruption, although she denies any wrongdoing. =Promoting Uzbekistan in politics= In 2005, Karimova established and promoted the \\"Centre for Political Studies\\", the first independent think tank. which focuses on scientific-applied research on present-day issues of internal and foreign policy of Uzbekistan, regional security, economic development and international cooperation. The Centre prepares informational, analytical and prognosis materials on these subjects. Today the Centre for Political Studies cooperates with more than 25 institutions worldwide. Karimova is a chief-editor of the monthly published the Information-Analytical Bulletin ‚ÄúUzbekistan & Central Asia‚Äù. =Charity and social initiatives= Gulnora I. Karimova World Economic Forum on the Middle East 2009 Under Karimova's supervision five NGOs have been established in Uzbekistan. In 2009, two of the foundations, the Social Initiatives Support Fund (SISF) and the Women's Council Public Association, organized a conference on \\"Medical aspects and role of Public Organizations in breast cancer problems solutions\\". In 2006, under the SISF, Karimova took on initiative of micro- credits for women farmers in rural areas of Uzbekistan. Karimova is founder and the chairperson of the social organisation called Forum of Culture and Arts of Uzbekistan Foundation (the Fund Forum). The Forum of Culture and Arts of Uzbekistan Foundation (the Fund Forum), the biggest NGO in the country was established in spring 2004 Since then, signed a number of MOU with international organisations and in 2010, received consultative status at the ECOSOC (United Nations Economic and Social Council). On 24 December 2010, the International Olympic Committee honored the Fund Forum with its annual \\"Sport ‚Äì Inspiring Young People\\" Trophy for its activities in the area of sport, education and culture among youth. Beyond national cultural and art promotion, the Fund also provides merit- and need-based scholarships for undergraduate and graduate levels. In June 2010, the Fund Forum in cooperation with other foundations engaged in humanitarian aid to those affected by the events in neighbouring Kyrgyzstan. In 2010, she initiated the organization of a charitable marathon, \\"In the Name of Life\\" under the auspices of the Fund Forum, the Women's Council and the Uzbekistan National Breast Cancer Association. 100,000 people across the Uzbekistan have joined the marathon since its launch. In 2012, Karimova is reported to donated over 25 million sum to the National Breast Cancer Association to purchase cancer medication during the marathon. In 2013, the race attracted 7,000 runners. In April 2012, Karimova announced that she had initiated the establishment of a new NGO, the \\"Forum of Socially Responsible Citizens of Uzbekistan\\", which focuses on support of Uzbek citizens' social initiatives. =Support of youth= In 2004, on her initiative was created \\"YangiAvlod\\" Festival which supports children in arts disciplines. Also in 2009, the news have spread internationally that two of the world's most famous football strikers Cameroonian Samuel Eto'o and Portuguese Cristiano Ronaldo agreed to support Gulnara Karimova's new initiative launching a children's project. Both of the players evidently have signed Memorandums of cooperation with the Fund Forum. Another project of Karimova, the Kelajak Ovozi Talented Youth Contest, has reportedly been attended by 388,000 young people in Uzbekistan since 2005, with projects and ideas ranging from IT, through architecture and design, to social innovations and poetry. =Music= In 2006, Karimova released her first music video singing a song called \\"Unutma Meni\\" (Don't Forget Me) under the stage name \\"Googoosha\\", apparently her father's nickname for her. She also performed in a later music video, singing a duet of \\"Besame Mucho\\" with Julio Iglesias. In December 2012, Googoosha released a duet with French actor G√©rard Depardieu. During his visit to Uzbekistan, the French actor agreed to star in an Uzbek film. Gulnara Karimova wrote a screenplay for \\"The Theft of the White Cocoon,\\" a story about the origin of the famed Central Asian silk, and set in the 5th and 6th centuries. Googoosha's first single \\"Round Run\\" was released in April 2012, with various remixes by DJ White Shadow, Razor N Guido of USA and Max Fadeev of Russia. In June 2012 Karimova released her self-titled debut album in the US and other countries on iTunes. The album was also expected to be released in Asia, Russia and a number of other European countries. However, early reviews by critics have panned the debut album thus indefinitely halting the release in those markets. =Fashion and jewellery design= In March 2009, Karimova presented her own special jewellery collection \\"GULI for Chopard\\", designed for renowned Swiss company Chopard. Reportedly her royalty for design from sales of the collection will benefit the \\"Yangi Avlod\\" (New Generation) Children's Festival. As of June 2016, the Children's Festival has yet to receive any monetary proceeds from the sales. In September 2010, Karimova presented her fashion line \\"Guli\\" featuring Uzbek fabrics and designs based on the traditional Uzbek long coat, at New York's Fashion Week. In September 2011, Karimova's planned spring 2012 fashion show at New York's Fashion Week was cancelled after Human Rights Watch and other organizations had drawn attention to her connection to her father's government and its record on torture, and child and forced labour. According to Human Rights Watch, up to two million Uzbek children are forced to leave school each year for two months to pick cottona fabric woven throughout Karimova's designs. However the fashion show was eventually held in New York, with the location changed to Cipriani. In Uzbekistan, Karimova also hosts Style.uz Art Week featuring catwalk shows of international labels such as Cavalli, Scervino and Chopard. Art Week also includes Theatre.uz International Theatre Festival, Golden Guepard Tashkent International Film Forum, Biennale and Photobiennale exhibitions as well as master-classes, round tables, concerts and charity events. Gulnara Karimova presented her first fragrances, Victorious for men and Mysterieuse for women, on 8 October, as part of Style.Uz Art Week 2012. The fragrances were created by French perfumer Bertrand Duchaufour. Halit Ergen√ß became a face of Victorious for men. =Cinema against AIDS= In May 2010, Karimova was at the center of a scandal surrounding her attendance of the annual \\"Cinema against AIDS\\" gala fundraising event organised by amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research during the Cannes Film Festival. AmfAR faced criticism from NGOs such as Reporters without Borders, with claims that it would be hypocritical for AmfAR to accept the attendance of Karimova given her country's refusal to take AIDS treatment seriously. Just months before the Cinema Against AIDS dinner, a 27-year-old AIDS activist, Maksim Popov, had been sentenced by an Uzbek court to seven years in prison for distributing information to stop the spread of HIV-AIDS. The Uzbek court deemed the information to be against society's moral standards. Personal life =Marriage and divorce= In 1991, she married Mansur Maqsudi, an American businessman of Afghanistan Tajik origin. They have two children, a son, Islam Karimov Jr., born in 1992 and a daughter, Iman Karimova, born in 1998. When the marriage started to crumble in July 2001, Karimova took the two children and left the United States for Uzbekistan. An Uzbek judge granted her a divorce, while a US court granted one to Maqsudi. When Karimova refused to accede to the US court ruling awarding custody of the two children to Maqsudi, an international arrest warrant in her name was filed with Interpol. In return, Maqsudi faced arrest in Uzbekistan, and some of his relatives were arrested and imprisoned. Others were driven to the Uzbek-Afghan border and released in Afghan territory, and Maqsudi had his business assets in Uzbekistan, particularly his interest in a joint-venture with Coca-Cola, taken away. According to The Guardian, as part of her divorce settlement, Karimova kept $4.5 million worth of jewellery and business interests worth approximately $60 million. On 9 July 2008, custody of the two children was fully given to Karimova, by a Consent Order signed by Judge Deanne M. Wilson (Superior Court of the State of New Jersey). =Rumours of marriage to Sodiq Safoyev= In 2003, when Sodiq Safoyev was the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Uzbekistan, rumours about his marriage to Karimova surfaced in local and international media. Safoyev, a career diplomat and a divorcee as of 2001, was hinted to have been picked by the President Islam Karimov as his possible replacement, hence the marriage to his daughter. However, the allegations were denied by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the BBC, which published the story, was accused by First Deputy Minister Vladimir Norov of intruding into the personal lives of Safoyev and Karimova. =Alleged house arrest and rumoured death= It has been reported by the BBC, based on a letter and a voice recording from Karimova (received in March and August 2014, respectively), that she is currently under house arrest. On 22 November 2016, a Central Asian news portal Centre1 claimed that Karimova died on 5 November 2016, after being poisoned and was buried in an unmarked grave in the Minor cemetery in Tashkent. According to RIA Novosti, sources close to the family disputed the claim that she was dead but did not provide any proof as to her current status or whereabouts.http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/the- times/dictators-daughter-killed-buried-in-unmarked-grave/news- story/9c56d8e9898aaa601129a8ab14dac4d8 In December 2016, Karimova's son, Islam Karimov Junior, called for his mother's whereabouts to be revealed by Uzbekistan. He revealed that she was being kept against her will \\"without any even basic human rights that every person deserves on this earth\\". He explained that living in London, he cannot go back to Uzbekistan from fears that he will not be allowed to return, which was also the reason why he did not attend the funeral of his grandfather, who was initially responsible for putting Karimova under house-arrest. In January 2017, The Wall Street Journal reported that Karimova was questioned by Swiss prosecutors in December, 2016, regarding accusations of money-laundering. At the time she was being kept under house arrest. In 2015, an investigation by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project reported that Karimova had taken over US$1 billion in bribes from Scandinavian and Russian telecom companies wanting involvement in the Uzbek market. In 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice seized $850 million that was funneled through corrupt deals by Karimova. Karimova is also under investigation in Uzbekistan on charges of corruption, although she denies any wrongdoing. Conviction On 28 July 2017, the Uzbek Prosecutor-General's Office released a statement saying that she was in custody following a 2015 conviction and faces additional charges in an ongoing investigation, marking the first time authorities have revealed details about her. The statement also said she was a member of an organised criminal group that controlled assets worth more than $1.3 billion in 12 countries, including properties in London worth ¬£22.9 million and hotels in Dubai worth $67.4 million. She was also alleged to have acquired $595 million worth of assets and received $869.3 million in kickbacks that were paid into offshore accounts. In 2017 Karimova was sentenced to 10 years in jail for fraud and money laundering but that was commuted in 2018 to five-year house arrest. In March 2019 she was sent to prison for allegedly violating the terms of her house arrest.

It features then-Boston Red Sox left fielder Manny Ramirez on its cover. The game features full Major League Baseball, Minor League Baseball, and Major League Baseball Players Association licenses. It holds the 98th spot on IGN's reader's choice top 100 games ever as of 2006. As with previous versions of the game, the announcers are Duane Kuiper and Mike Krukow, real-life announcers for the San Francisco Giants. A PlayStation Portable version of the game, titled just MVP Baseball, was later released in May 2005. Since its release, it has been considered by many to be one of the greatest baseball games of all time. Gameplay MVP Baseball 2005 includes all 30 official Major League Baseball teams, stadiums, and all 30 unique dynasties, as well as the more than 1,000 individual players that populate their respective teams. A notable exclusion is Barry Bonds, who does not appear in the game due to his withdrawal from the MLBPA's licensing agreement. His \\"replacement\\" is a fictional player named Jon Dowd. Dowd bears no resemblance in appearance to Bonds, but his skills mimic those of Bonds. Like its predecessor MVP Baseball 2004, this game does not include Kevin Millar, who does not appear in the game because he is not a member of the MLBPA. His \\"replacement\\" is a fictional player named Anthony Friese. The game also includes authentic minor league teams and actual minor league players by including double-A and triple-A-level farm teams. 2005's installment includes ballclubs from the High Single-A ranks as well, giving each MLB team three levels of minor league farm clubs. 2 legends teams, 63 legendary players, 15 classic stadiums, 5 fantasy parks, and more than 100 retro uniforms round out the list of unlockable features. Rosters are current as of January 12, 2005, and the game included the then-new Washington Nationals, along with their then temporary home, RFK Stadium. At the time, new rosters could be downloaded to the Xbox and PS2 versions by accessing their online play menus. MVP Baseball 2005 includes an exhibition mode, a manager's mode, two different franchise modes, a scenario editor, and a handful of baseball-themed practice games. The exhibition mode lets the player quickly set up a game against another team, and both pick a starting pitcher and adjust the lineup, if needed. The manager mode is simulated based on the choices the players make before the opening pitch. The player doesn't actually see the players swing or make plays. Instead, the player picks from a list of managerial choices, and the outcome of each play is printed onscreen in a running box score. The scenario editor lets players adjust 20 different variables‚Äîsuch as the teams involved, inning, count, who's on base, and so on‚Äîthe players can set up every possible scenario that has ever occurred in baseball history. A minor glitch in Kuiper's commentary is about switch-hitters who are currently batting, claiming the batter hits better from one side, but when looking at the batter's power and/or contact stats, they actually hit better from the other side. For example, although Lance Berkman's power and contact stats are both higher batting left-handed in the game by default, Kuiper will claim that Berkman hits better batting right-handed. Another quirk is that he claims Hack Wilson set the MLB single-season runs scored record with 192 in 1930. However, he actually set the MLB single-season RBIs record with 191 in 1930. The single-A Wilmington Blue Rocks' uniforms are misspelled, with an extra L in \\"Wilmington.\\" Franchise Modes Both the dynasty and owner's modes keep track of events and statistics. Injuries and suspensions occur throughout the season, requiring the players to adjust lineups accordingly. Other teams will offer trades, and some of the players' own players will ask to be traded. On the statistics side, the game keeps a running tally of the current and previous season statistics in 64 different categories, along with 120 years' worth of league leading stats. =Dynasty Mode= Dynasty Mode lets gamers draft and manage a team for up to 120 full seasons, including spring training games. Responsibilities include setting lineups, making trades, and shuffling players up and down through the team's three minor league farm clubs. Team chemistry, rivalries, and player moods are also variables in the dynasty mode that can be strengthened or weakened by win/loss records, player salaries, playing time, and position in the batting order or pitching rotation. The players' moods can be monitored via face icons in each player's profile. If a player is unhappy or wants to be traded, the player may send a message in MVP Inbox asking the players if they could consider their desires. The game gives the player a changing series of 1 and 3-year goals to live up to. Meeting these goals boosts managerial rating and team chemistry. Failing to do so has the opposite effect. Games can be played in real time, or chunks of the season can be simulated in one fell swoop. The dynasty mode in MVP Baseball 2004 had a bug that made it impossible for computer-generated players to evolve into A-list superstars unless the players actually played 95% of the team's games. That was fixed in the 2005 release. It's now possible to give players an added stats bonus by playing the batting and pitching minigames during spring training. =Owner Mode= The other franchise-style mode is called Owner Mode, and much like the similar mode in EA's Madden NFL games, it tacks ownership and financial responsibilities on to Dynasty Mode. Here the players can set ticket and concessions prices, hire staff, buy and sell new stadium shops, schedule promotional giveaways, and buy all sorts of stadium upgrades (such as scoreboards, additional seats, home run fireworks, and luxury boxes). The goal is to last for 30 years. There are a variety of player, team, and financial reports to look at that show team's progress on a daily and yearly basis. In Owner Mode, players may design a custom ballpark for their team. The ballpark editor lets the players pick from a set list of various locations, field shapes, and seat colors, as well as specific wall, grass, and dirt designs. It also lets players add on additional seating levels and grandstands throughout the course of the career. =Features= The most prominent new feature in the game is the \\"Hitter's Eye\\" system, which turns the baseball different colors in the pitcher's hand (stays white for fastballs, red for breaking pitches, green for off-speed pitches, pink for sinkers and orange for knuckleballs) and leaves a trail as the ball flies through the air toward the plate to aid in hitting, which game developers said had been too difficult in previous versions. In addition to the Hitter's Eye, an Owner Mode feature and pitching and hitting Mini-Games were added. Other minor features include the ability for the managers to argue with the umpires at any time (automatic ejection for arguing balls and strikes) and a slow motion overhead view of the plate that can be accessed after every pitch (pitch/swing analysis) to see pitch location or the batter's timing. Games can also be rained out, forcing a player to play a doubleheader. Minor league teams from the California, Carolina, and Florida State Leagues (High A) were added to their respective teams, although most Minor League rosters are incomplete and feature developer-created replacement players. The game also supported online play, but as of 2008 the servers for the Xbox and PS2 versions are unavailable. =Soundtrack= The soundtrack for MVP Baseball 2005 includes nine songs all by different artists. The game was the first release for four of these songs, from artists ...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead, The Bravery, Hot Hot Heat and Louis XIV. The soundtrack is widely held as one of the best in- game soundtracks of the 2000s. Reception By July 2006, the PlayStation 2 version of MVP Baseball 2005 had sold 1 million copies and earned $29 million in the United States. Next Generation ranked it as the 55th highest-selling game launched for the PlayStation 2, Xbox or GameCube between January 2000 and July 2006 in that country. Combined console sales of MVP Baseball games released in the 2000s reached 3.5 million units in the United States by July 2006. =Critical response= The game was met with positive to average reception. GameRankings and Metacritic gave it a score of 87.53% and 88 out of 100 for the GameCube version; 87.10% and 87 out of 100 for the PlayStation 2 version; 86.96% and 86 out of 100 for the Xbox version; 84.57% and 85 out of 100 for the PC version; and 66.78% and 67 out of 100 for the PSP version. =Awards= The game was given an award for best sports video game of 2005 from X-Play. In May 2013 the game ranked fourth on a \\"Best sports video games\\" list by ESPN.ESPN's Sports Video Game Rankings on espn.go.com by Jon Robinson (May 2015) MVP Baseball 2005 was a finalist for PC Gamer USs \\"Best Sports Game 2005\\" award, which ultimately went to Tiger Woods PGA Tour 06. = Legacy = After EA lost the license and ended the support for the game, the game's modding community continues the support and releases updated roster lists every year as also alternative leagues (e.g. MVP Caribe, MVP Mods, etc.).Nine Years Later, Latin America's Leagues Keep MVP Baseball Alive on Kotaku by Owen Good (December 22, 2013)Open Source Breathes New Life Into MVP Baseball 2005 Video Game on protecode.com by Sara Purdon (on Sep 15, 2015) See also *MVP Baseball series *MVP 06: NCAA Baseball *Chronology of baseball video games References External links Category:GameCube games Category:PlayStation 2 games Category:PlayStation Portable games Category:Windows games Category:Xbox games Category:Major League Baseball video games Category:2005 video games Category:EA Sports games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Video games developed in Canada ","title":"MVP Baseball 2005"},{"id":"1898803","text":"Battle of Messines, 7 June 1917 The following is a list of Australian Army medical units in World War I.

History  =Early beginnings= Hong Leong Bank began its operations in 1905 in Kuching, Sarawak, under the name of Kwong Lee Mortgage & Remittance Company. The company granted loans against the security of export commodities such as pepper, rubber and other indigenous products. It also provided the services of remitting money of overseas Chinese to their families in the Southeast region of China. In the initial years, the company went through a difficult period of growth, caught in the middle of a few economic crises. The First World War broke out in 1914 causing panic in the financial circles. A few years after hostilities ended, the post-war Recession of 1920-1921 set in. After the recession, the company opened its branch in Sibu in 1923. Three years later, another branch was opened in Singapore in 1926. The year 1929 saw the start of the Great Depression that lasted until 1933. The Depression caused a sharp fall in the export earnings of commodities and many business concerns, including some banks, were in financial difficulties. Kwong Lee Mortgage and Remittance Company survived all these setbacks because of its strong cash reserves and its conservative operational policy. Immediately after the Depression, on 26 October 1934, the company was converted into a public company under the name Kwong Lee Bank. Shortly after, the third branch of the Bank was opened in Sarikei in 1937. The Second World War caused a temporary disruption in the currency and banking system. After the war, the immediate task was one of reconstruction and rehabilitation. In this connection, Kwong Lee Bank played an important role in reviving confidence and business activities by providing financing to enable old businesses to be resumed and new ones to be set up. The aftermath of the war saw the continued expansion of the Bank, and in 1964, Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation of Singapore (OCBC Bank) under the stewardship of Tan Chin Tuan (its then Chairman and Managing Director) acquired a 52% majority stake in Kwong Lee Bank from the Lam family. In 1973, Kwong Lee Bank opened another branch in Bintangor. =Expansion= In late 1977, Yang Amat Mulia Tunku Osman Ibni Tunku Temenggong Ahmad, a member of the royal family from the State of Johor, came in as a shareholder of the bank and acquired 30% of its share capital from both OCBC Bank and the Lam family. The period subsequent to this saw a change in the direction of Kwong Lee Bank's expansion. From five banking branch offices in Sarawak (Kuching, Sibu, Sarikei, Serian and Bintangor) and one in Singapore, the bank expanded its operations to Peninsular Malaysia when it opened its first branch in Kuala Lumpur in May 1978 and this was followed by another branch in Johor Bahru during the same month. Over the next four years, a total of six branches were opened in Labis, Segamat, Bintulu, Kota Tinggi, Kota Kinabalu and Kluang and on 1 January 1982, the Head Office was relocated from Kuching to Kuala Lumpur. = Acquisitions = In May 1982, Kwong Lee Bank Berhad was acquired by the MUI Group, a corporate group controlled by Malaysian business tycoon Tan Sri Dato Khoo Kay Peng. Exiting shareholders include OCBC Bank (which acquired a stake in the bank in 1964) and members of the Lam family (relatives and descendants of the founder Lam Ji Chiew). Kwong Lee Bank Berhad was renamed Malayan United Bank Berhad on 2 February 1983. Subsequently, it was renamed MUI Bank Bhd. Under the MUI banner, the bank grew from 11 branches (including Singapore) to 35 branches. On 3 January 1994, the Hong Leong Group Malaysia acquired MUI Bank Berhad through Hong Leong Credit Berhad and renamed it as Hong Leong Bank Berhad (HLBB). The acquisition of MUI Bank Berhad by Hong Leong Group Malaysia (which is controlled by Malaysian business tycoon Quek Leng Chan) followed shortly after an aborted takeover attempt by another Malaysian tycoon Tan Sri Dato Vincent Tan Chee Yioun (through his vehicle Berjaya Corporation). HLBB was listed on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange on 17 October 1994 with its total paid-up capital enlarged to RM 470 million. Since then, the growth of the bank has been remarkable. The consolidation of the banking institution to meet the requirements of Bank Negara Malaysia marks another milestone for Hong Leong Bank Berhad. The completion of the merger of Hong Leong Bank with Wah Tat Bank and Hong Leong Finance with Credit Corporation Malaysia on 1 January 2001 marks the emergence of a larger banking group. HLBB is a member of the Hong Leong Group. The group has diversified businesses in financial services, manufacturing, property, and infrastructure development. = Acquisition of EON Bank = On 6 May 2011, Hong Leong Bank announced that it had completed its acquisition on EON Capital Bhd's assets and liabilities, making EON Bank part of Hong Leong Bank Group. Within close to 8 weeks, the legal vesting was concluded where all assets and liabilities of the former EON Bank was vested into HLB. The merger creates the country‚Äôs fourth-largest bank with an asset size of more than RM140 billion, with a total of 329 branches.EON Bank Group is now part of Hong Leong Bank Group Corporate affairs =Personal banking= The bank provides banking services and financial products, which include property, auto, personal loans, payment products, share financing, investment, and insurance, as well as deposits and remittance to individuals and small businesses. =Business and corporate banking= Principal business activities include the provision of banking solutions such as deposit and loan services covering business current account, interest-bearing auto-sweep as well as fixed deposit, and financing options ranging from asset acquisition, working capital, and debt capital market structures, for corporate, commercial and SME client base. HLB also specializes in the provision of transaction banking solutions via cash management, trade financing and services.

Controversy In February 2013, the bank had embarked on a rationalization exercise as part of its continuing efforts to review its business and maintain competitiveness. As part of the exercise involves transfer non-executive staffs from all over the country to three centralized locations, it created dissatisfactions amongst affected employees. A picket was held at Wisma Hong Leong in November 2013. Alleged wrongful dismissal of the 27 employees for refusing to transfer has been referred to Industrial Court.

The biblical incense frankincense is an extract from the resin of the tree Boswellia sacra, and is now produced also from B. frereana. Frankincense The four main species of Boswellia, B. sacra (synonyms B. carteri and B. bhaw-dajiana), B. frereana, B. papyrifera, and B. serrata, produce true frankincense, and each type of resin is available in various grades. The grades depend on the time of harvesting, and the resin is hand sorted for quality. Description Boswellia species are moderate-sized flowering plants, including both trees and shrubs, and are native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. The distributions of the species are primarily associated with the tropics.Weeks, A., Daly, D.C. and B.B. Simpson. 2005. The phylogenetic history and biogeography of the frankincense and myrrh family (Burseraceae) based on nuclear and chloroplast sequence data. Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution, 35: 85-101.

Plant Systematics: A Phylogenetic Approach 3rd ed. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, Massachusetts, USA. The flowers may have four or five faintly connate but imbricate sepals with an equal number of distinct, imbricate petals. Also, the stamens, that may contain nectar discs, have distinct glabrous filaments that occur in one or two whorls and in numbers equaling or twice the number of petals; the tricolporate pollen is contained within two locules of the anthers that open longitudinally along slits. The gynoecium contains three to five connate carpels, one style, and one stigma that is head-like to lobed. Each locule of the superior ovary has two ovules with axile placentation that are anatropous to campylotropous. The one- to five- pitted fruit is a drupe that opens at maturity. The endosperm is usually lacking in the embryo. The species name honors Scottish botanist John Boswell, 1710 - 1780 (incidentally uncle of writer James Boswell).https://books.google.com/books?id=A68qyOyhOdkC&pg;=PA331&lpg;=PA331&dq;=boswell+species+names&source;=bl&ots;=BRQKewSEkV&sig;=ACfU3U324g7QINyh3Sn47AbZ82dINTEAUw&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwifxPmF0u_mAhXXv54KHSCaCBQQ6AEwBnoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q;=boswell%20species%20names&f;=false Ecological status In 1998, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) warned that one of the primary frankincense species, Boswellia sacra, is \\"near threatened\\". Frankincense trees are not covered by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, but experts argue that Boswellia species meet the criteria for protection. In a 2006 study, an ecologist at Wageningen University & Research claimed that, by the late-1990s, Boswellia papyrifera trees in Eritrea were becoming hard to find. In 2019, a new paper predicted a 50% reduction in Boswellia papyrifera within the next two decades. This species, found mainly in Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Sudan, accounts for about two-thirds of global frankincense production. The paper warns that all Boswellia species are threatened by habitat loss and overexploitation. Most Boswellia grow in harsh, arid regions beset by poverty and conflict. Harvesting and selling the tree's resin is one of the only sources of income for the inhabitants, resulting in overtapping.

Early life Rivers musical career started fairly early on, with him playing the tuba in a band in Arlington Middle School. He got into music initially because of John Otto, who played jazz-style drums. Many have said that Otto is a cousin of Rivers, but during a documentary that was recorded of the band recording their second album, Rivers admits that they initially thought they were cousins but realised neither parents were related. He attended Bishop Kenny High School. He played guitar before he played bass, but switched at the suggestion of his music teacher. Career =Limp Bizkit= Sam Rivers with Limp Bizkit Rivers first met Fred Durst while working at a Chick-fil-A in a mall in Jacksonville. The two started talking, and found they shared several interests, including skateboarding and music. They decided to get together for a jam session. Rivers was becoming an accomplished bass guitarist, and Durst was to be a vocalist. Together with several other people they formed a short-lived band called Malachi Sage. Rivers' talents on guitar would later come into play in Limp Bizkit's Results May Vary album, the only album not featuring longtime guitarist Wes Borland, with Rivers playing both guitar and bass on select songs such as \\"Creamer\\" and \\"Lonely World\\". When the band did not work out, the two decided to try again, and this time Otto came into the picture to be the drummer at the suggestion of Rivers. In 1994, the three formed Limp Bizkit. Later on guitarist Wes Borland came into the fold, as well as DJ Lethal, in 1996. Rivers was the youngest member of the band. When their first album Three Dollar Bill, Yall was released, he was 19 years old. In 2015, Rivers reportedly left Limp Bizkit following a diagnosis of degenerative disc disease. However, Rivers revealed in 2020 his departure from Limp Bizkit was due to liver disease caused by excessive drinking. Rivers subsequently received a liver transplant. In absentia, live bass duties were covered by Samuel Gerhard Mpungu and Tsuzumi Okai. He was voted Best Bass Player at the 2000 Gibson Awards. =Recent work= After Limp Bizkit went on hiatus, Rivers became a producer for local bands in Jacksonville. He produced the debut albums by Burn Season and The Embraced. Most recently, Rivers has been producing for the Orlando-based band Indorphine. Aside from producing their new studio material, Rivers got them booked as the opening act for a Mushroomhead/SOiL concert. In early 2009, Rivers reunited with Limp Bizkit for tours and their sixth studio album, Gold Cobra released in 2011. Rivers is now pursuing another project with ex Puddle of Mudd bassist Damien Starkey in a band called Sleepkillers, along with Adam Latiff and Saliva vocalist Bobby Amaru, and released their self titled debut album on March 1, 2019. Personal life His influences include bands such as Black Sabbath and Megadeth. Rivers cites Jeff Ament from Pearl Jam as a big influence on his playing. In the early 2000s, Rivers married Kinter Atkins. They divorced due to personal issues. Currently Rivers is in a relationship with porn actress Kayla Paige. Equipment Rivers was originally endorsed by Ibanez, and one of his basses was a customized BTB 5-string, but currently uses custom made Warwick basses, with LEDs in the fretboard. Rivers has also been seen using Wal Basses since 2005, mainly in the studio and uses Ampeg and Warwick amps. Collaborations * Marilyn Manson ft.

The Life, Adventures and Piracies of the Famous Captain Singleton is a novel by Daniel Defoe, originally published in 1720. It has been re-published multiple times since, some of which times were in 1840 1927, 1972 and 2008. Captain Singleton is believed to have been partly inspired by the exploits of the English pirate Henry Every, who operated in the late 17th century. The narrative describes the life of the Englishman, Singleton, stolen from a well-to-do family as a child and raised by Gypsies, eventually making his way to sea. The former half of the book concerns Singleton's crossing of Africa, the latter half concerning his life as a pirate in the Indian Ocean and Arabian Sea. Defoe's description of piracy focuses for the most part on matters of economics and logistics, and Singleton's pirate behaves more like a merchant adventurer, perhaps Defoe's comment on the mercantilism of his day.  Characters  * Captain Bob Singleton * William Walters, a Quaker * Captain Wilmot * Captain Avery  Major themes  * Piracy ‚Äì The novel is not as concerned with piracy itself as it may appear in relation to its title. The concept of piracy allows Singleton a justification for his voyage, but upon reaching the novel's end, he discards the concept in favour of a merchant's identity. * Mercantilism * Exploration ‚Äì Singleton makes an immense sweep geographically, covering areas such as Southampton, Lisbon, the East Indies, Cabo de bona Speranza, Madagascar, Africa, the West Indies, Black Sea and the Asian Archipelagos. His voyages mirror and celebrate those of Christopher Columbus, Magellan and Vasco de Gama. * Conquest * Slavery ‚Äì Captain Singleton's abduction and sale as a young boy is a part of Defoe's exploration of slavery within the novel. Some studies have focused on Captain Singleton in relation to its 'commentary on African slavery', even suggesting that it might be read as a narrative of slavery. There is discussion of the 'Plantation' within the novel; 'a site of unfree, hard labor', and 'by invoking the \\"Plantation\\", Defoe demonstrates the elision between slavery and servitude practiced in the North American colonies and the Caribbean. [...] The notion that an English child can be \\"sold\\" (and invoked by the author in a casual manner as though it is not an unusual occurrence) indicates that slavery in the New World had not settled into racialized dichotomies.' The novel explores many different kinds of slavery, and 'Defoe's character operates in a context where he is both capable of enslaving as well as being enslaved. This duality of experience forms a recurring theme in the novel that illustrates many forms of enslavement and beliefs about enslavement.' The text represents 'anxiety about the many slaveries to which man was prey during the eighteenth century. The enslavements expressed both physically and metaphorically demonstrate concepts in flux as ideas of trade, nationality, and the nature of man clashed. [...] Defoe, through Singleton, comments extensively about different forms of enslavement (as both master and slave), albeit filtered through a very Eurocentric perspective.'  Plot summary  The Life, Adventures, and Pyracies, of the Famous Captain Singleton (1720) covers both land and sea in one volume, in two neatly composed halves. The first half of the novel includes a remarkable overland trek across Africa after the characters are stranded in Madagascar, and the second half is almost entirely at sea, involving piratical heists in the East Indies. Eventually, Captain Bob and his close friend William Walters return to England with their spoils via Venice, disguised as Armenians.'  Plot  At the beginning of the novel, Singleton, as a young boy, is kidnapped and sold to a gypsy by a beggar-woman. He is raised as a ward of a parish, and sent to sea at age twelve. Soon he is captured by Turkish pirates, rescued by sailors from Portugal, and after a two-year stay in that country, sails for the East Indies. By his own account, young Singleton is a rogue who steals from the ship's captain and harbors the desire to kill his master. Nearly hanged for his part in an attempted mutiny, Singleton is set ashore with four companions on the coast of Madagascar. A score of other sailors from the ship join them and the ensuing narrative relates their efforts to survive on the island. The sailors find and rebuild an abandoned boat and eventually decide to pursue a journey through Africa. In their encounters with African natives, the Europeans prove resourceful but brutal. During the hazardous trip Singleton becomes the leader of the group by virtue of his fearlessness and ingenuity. He is a cold pragmatist whose lack of compassion is exceeded only by his talent for survival. When they find a wounded native, Singleton makes a decision based purely on expediency. Singleton makes the decision, after considering to let the native die, that they might find the man useful to them - as is written \\"I found the man had some respect showed him, it presently occurred to my thoughts that we might bring him to be useful to us, and perhaps make him a kind of commander over them\\", they than take to call the native 'prince'. During the arduous march through lands teeming with leopards, elephants, crocodiles, and snakes, the travellers avoid catastrophe because of their modern weaponry and their European belief in reason rather than in magic. The marchers meet an English merchant who has been living with the natives and who persuades Singleton and his companions to stop awhile in order to dig for gold. Having loaded themselves down with gold and elephant tusks, the adventurers finally reach a Dutch settlement, where they divide the spoils and immediately go their separate ways. Once Singleton has spent his fortune in England, he sets out again, this time for the West Indies where, by his boastful admission, he quickly takes to piracy. Singleton's abilities bring him high command, although his piratical activities encourage the growth of a callousness so pervasive that at times it leads to cruelty. He denies that his men have committed certain atrocities, but calmly admits that \\"more was done than it is fit to speak of here\\" (p. 188). In this portion of the novel events pile up rapidly, and there are chases and sea battles in which Singleton proves himself an able, courageous, and imaginative leader. From the Indies the scene shifts to the East African coast and Madagascar where the pirates continue to plunder and sail restlessly in search of new conquests. Defoe draws a portrait of men whose love of gold is less urgent than their need for adventure. This lust for novelty takes Singleton and his men into the Pacific as far as the Philippines, before they trace their way back to the Indian Ocean and Ceylon. Friend William, a Quaker surgeon, becomes the center of the narrative as he outwits a Ceylonese King and rescues a Dutch slave. William displays further resourcefulness by succeeding in trade negotiations with English merchants in India. He serves Singleton loyally and bravely as a kind of man Friday: he is, moreover, a Christian humanist and healer who ultimately persuades his captain that a life of piracy leads nowhere. When Singleton contemplates suicide in the throes of repentance, William convinces him that the idea of taking one's life is the \\"Devil's Notion\\" (p. 332) and therefore must be ignored. When they return to England, they make the decision to stay together for the rest of their lives. Singleton marries William's sister, a widow, and the story ends rapidly on a note of domestic peace.

The title refers to the World War II-era eponymous propaganda movies commissioned by the U.S. Government to justify their decision to enter the war against the Axis Powers. Why We Fight was first screened at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival on January 17, 2005, exactly forty-four years after President Dwight D. Eisenhower's farewell address. Although it won the Grand Jury Prize for Documentary, it received a limited public cinema release on January 22, 2006, and then was released on DVD on June 27, 2006, by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment. The documentary also won one of the 2006 Grimme Awards in the competition \\"Information & Culture\\"; the prize is one of Germany's most prestigious for television productions and a Peabody Award in 2006.66th Annual Peabody Awards, May 2007. Synopsis Why We Fight describes the rise and maintenance of the United States military‚Äìindustrial complex and its 50-year involvement with the wars led by the United States to date, especially its 2003 invasion of Iraq. The documentary asserts that in every decade since World War II, the American public was misled so that the government (incumbent Administration) could take them to war and fuel the military-industrial economy maintaining American political dominance in the world. Interviewed about this matter are politician John McCain, political scientist and former CIA analyst Chalmers Johnson, politician Richard Perle, neoconservative commentator William Kristol, writer Gore Vidal, and public policy expert Joseph Cirincione. Why We Fight documents the consequences of said foreign policy with the stories of a Vietnam War veteran whose son was killed in the September 11, 2001 attacks, and who then asked the military to write the name of his dead son on any bomb to be dropped in Iraq; a 23-year-old New Yorker who enlists in the United States Army because he was poor and in debt, his decision impelled by his mother's death; and a military explosives scientist (Anh Duong) who arrived in the U.S. as a refugee child from Vietnam in 1975.

He had been accused of raping a pregnant white woman in northern Pearl River County, Mississippi. Three days before he was to stand trial, Parker was kidnapped from his jail cell in the Pearl River County Courthouse by a mob, beaten and shot. His body was found in the Pearl River, 20 miles west of Poplarville, 10 days later. Following an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the men who killed him were released. Despite confessions, no one was ever indicted for the killing.\\"FBI re-opens Mack Charles Parker lynching\\" May 9, 2009 The Picayune Item\\"Justice Department still won‚Äôt release names of lynch mob\\", March 3, 2010, Clarion Ledger Historian Howard Smead called the killing the \\"last classic lynching in America.\\" Accusations of rape Parker was arrested for the February 23, 1959, rape and kidnapping of June Walters, a pregnant white woman, in Pearl River County, Mississippi. Walters reported that the crime occurred on a dirt logging road called Black Creek Ford Road, off U. S. Route 11, approximately seven miles south of Lumberton, Mississippi, where she and her child were waiting alone in a car while her husband, Jimmy sought help for repairs. Parker vehemently denied having raped anyone, and statements from his supporters after his death suggested that the rape accusations may have been fabricated by the alleged victim as a means of concealing an ongoing consensual affair with a local white man.\\"Chicagoans Doubt Claims of Rape,\\" Chicago Defender, May 11, 1959 According to reports published in the New Orleans Times-Picayune and the Jackson Clarion-Ledger, Parker and four friends, Norman Malachy, David Alfred, Curt Underwood and Tommy Grant were returning to Lumberton from Poplarville. The five men had been to Slim‚Äôs, an illegal bar which was operated under the protection of the Poplarville City Police. It was located in the black section of Poplarville, and was known for selling white lightning moonshine. As the five neared Lumberton, Parker and his four companions spotted a Dodge sedan broken down on the side of the road. Assuming the car was abandoned, they stopped. Parker got out and shone a flashlight into the car. Upon recognizing a white woman in the car, Parker returned to his brother's Chevy sedan and left. As they left the scene, Parker allegedly turned to his friends and said, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt we stop and get some o‚Äô that white stuff?‚Äù Telling him he was crazy, the four men told Parker to take them home. According to local law enforcement officials, before the woman‚Äôs husband could return to the disabled car, Parker allegedly returned, kidnapped June Walters and her four-year-old daughter, Debbie, at gunpoint and took them to Black Creek Ford Road, where he raped Walters. Curt Underwood, Parker's brother-in-law, who was there that night, disputed the version of events. The woman did not identify her alleged attacker by name or detailed description beyond sex, race and approximate age. After an intensive manhunt, Lumberton police were informed by David Alfred‚Äôs father, a local Baptist minister, that Parker was the perpetrator. Parker was arrested at approximately 10 a.m. on February 24 at his Lumberton home by Lumberton City Marshal Ham Slade. Parker was beaten by Slade and his deputies, to the horror of his mother, Mrs. Eliza Parker. Parker‚Äôs screams could be heard several houses away. Parker vehemently denied having raped anyone. In a line-up at the Lumberton City Jail, the victim identified Parker. A check of the tire tracks left by the perpetrator‚Äôs car indicated they were similar to those of Parker‚Äôs Chevrolet, but a positive identification could not be made. A check of fingerprints failed to implicate Parker. Soon after his arrest, and for his own protection, Lumberton Police had the Mississippi Highway Patrol transfer Parker to the Hinds County Jail in Jackson. While in the Hinds County Jail, Parker was subjected to several lie detector tests. All of the lie detector tests given Parker proved to be inconclusive or that he was telling the truth. In addition, no handgun was ever found by police, nor was one ever connected to Mack Charles Parker. On April 13, Parker was indicted by a Pearl River County grand jury, on one count of rape and two counts of kidnapping. Two days later, Parker was returned to Pearl River County to appear before Judge Sebe Dale, Sr., on April 17. Being represented by attorney and civil rights activist, R. Jess Brown of Vicksburg, Parker pleaded not guilty to each charge. Judge Dale set the trial date for April 27, and Parker was returned to his cell at the Pearl River County Courthouse. The involvement of Brown in the case led to fear he might be freed thanks to civil rights claims such as the absence of any Black in the jury. Murder = Kidnapping from the prison = According to the FBI report on the case, sometime around 12.15 a.m. on April 25, a vigilante mob of eight to ten hooded and masked men, wearing gloves, entered the courthouse. Supposedly, they were let into the locked jail area by a deputy sheriff, Jewell Alford, who was with them. As Alford unlocked the door, eight to ten from the mob entered Parker‚Äôs cell. He begged for help from other prisoners, but the mob threatened them with guns. A life and death struggle soon ensued as Parker tried to escape and he was beaten with clubs by the mob. As the mob dragged Parker out of the courthouse, and down its concrete steps, he was bleeding profusely. He pleaded to be able to walk instead of being dragged. Blood spurted from his wounds, leaving bloody hand prints and pools of blood along the route out of the courthouse. = Transport to the Pearl River = The mob had two cars waiting outside for their escape. Parker was stuffed into the back seat of one and the two cars sped off west toward Bogalusa, Louisiana on Mississippi Highway 26. The car with Parker inside continued west on Mississippi Highway 26 until it reached the Mississippi-Louisiana border at the Pearl River Bridge, approximately 20 miles west of Poplarville. = Killing and disposal of the body = According to the FBI, the mob with Parker in the car drove into Louisiana, where they waited to make sure the road was traffic-free. Once they were assured they were in the clear, Parker was driven to the center of the bridge. He was then pulled from the car and shot twice in the chest from a range of approximately six inches. Parker died within seconds. The original plan had been to castrate Parker and hang him from the superstructure of the Pearl River Bridge; however, with Parker now dead, the mob decided to abandon its plan in fear of being discovered. They proceeded to weight his body down with logging chains which were produced from the trunk of one of the cars. Once the chains were secured around Parker‚Äôs body, it was tossed over the concrete railings of the bridge into the rain-swollen waters of the Pearl River below. = Discovery of the crime = Upon learning of the events in the early morning hours of April 25, Pearl River County Sheriff, Osborn Moody, informed the Mississippi Highway Patrol, who then urged him to contact the FBI. That same morning, Moody obtained a \\"John Doe\\" warrant for the kidnapping of Mack Charles Parker. On May 4, Parker's bloated and decomposing body was found floating in the waters of the Pearl River two and one-half miles south of the Pearl River Bridge at Bogalusa. Investigation = FBI investigation = Almost immediately, 60 agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation descended upon the town of Poplarville. In the two weeks following Parker‚Äôs death, the FBI questioned hundreds of potential witnesses and suspects. Several local Poplarville men, Jewel Alford, Christopher Columbus \\"Crip\\" Reyer, L. C. Davis, \\"Preacher\\" James Floren Lee, his son James Floren \\"Jeff\\" Lee, Herman Schultz, Arthur Smith and J.P. Walker, a former Pearl River County Sheriff‚Äôs deputy, who would be elected sheriff of Pearl River County in November 1963, quickly became the focus of the FBI‚Äôs intensive probe into the abduction and death of Parker. In a three-hour interrogation session, FBI agents browbeat Crip Reyer. Reyer finally admitted that his red and white 1956 Oldsmobile 88 had been used by the mob, but denied having anything to do with the abduction or killing of Parker. On May 13, under intense pressure from FBI agents, Arthur Smith confirmed the role of each of the participants and supplied the names of Walker, Preacher Lee, L.C. Davis and the names of others who were in the two cars. Smith told agents that Lee, Reyer, Davis, and Walker were in the lead car that carried Parker from the jail. = In courts = The judge and prosecutor would not co-operate with the FBI investigation and refused to hand over FBI evidence to the grand jury, deeming it hearsay, even though several of the mob members had confessed to the lynching. Judge Dale, who praised Theodore Bilbo's racial beliefs, and was a member of the White Citizens' Council; refused to indict the suspects. Dale encouraged the grand jury to \\"have the backbone to stand against any tyranny,\\" stating \\"you are now engaged in battle for our laws and courts for the preservation of our freedom and our way of life.\\" He urged them to \\"keep their mouths shut.\\" Dale also previously refused, before the lynching, Sheriff Moody's request to move Parker outside the county or have members of the Mississippi National Guard protect Parker. After a Mississippi grand jury refused to indict the lynchers, a federal grand jury in Biloxi then oversaw the case under District Court Judge Sidney Mize on January 1960 and failed to indict some of the mob by a single vote. Before the trial, Dale went to meet Mize and managed to convince him to narrow the Federal kidnaping statute Before the last grand jury convened, Poplarville mayor Pat Hyde stated that ‚Äúyou couldn‚Äôt convict the guilty parties if you had sound film of the lynching,‚Äù and an unnamed Poplarville businessman rhetorically asked why the FBI even bothered to investigate since no jury would convict the killers. = Reactions = A May 11 article in the Chicago Defender, a popular black newspaper circulated throughout the South, recounted an interview with an anonymous white male from Poplarville, claiming to have personal knowledge that the charges against Parker were fabricated. The alleged witness claimed that the alleged victim, June Walters, was in fact having an affair with a local white man, and she went with him while her husband, Jimmy, was gone to get help to fix the car. When her absence was discovered before she returned, she concocted a rape and kidnapping story to shield her infidelity. The witness also indicated that the alleged victim fainted upon learning of Parker's kidnapping from the jail, and stated that he deserved a trial. On June 1959, attempts were made to enact an anti-lynching bill, which was stalled, as many others, by the Southern Democratic bloc. Unlike the article in the Chicago Defender, biographer Howard Smead, who wrote the book Blood Justice: The Lynching of Mack Charles Parker, believes that Parker was most likely not innocent, but said he was \\"not 100 percent sure.\\" Smead believes that Parker should have been given a fair trial and states that he never had a chance to prove his innocence. Smead writes that the local black community, many of whom knew Parker, were divided in opinion of his guilt. Many who held him, at the time of the crime, to be guilty, never wavered in their view thereafter. Some locals complained about supposed FBI encroachment and other aired typically racist statements, such as one resident stating to reporters that \\"Parker's a good nigger now. The only good nigger is a dead nigger.\\" Other residents complained about \\"reckless conduct\\" from FBI agents, and an unnamed town leader said about the town that \\"We all are shook up over the lynching, but many suffer from a case of a bad conscience.\\" During the campaign for the Democratic primary for governorship, the following posters were affiched in the county by Ross Barnett supporters: > Remember Hungary. Remember Little Rock. Remember the Occupation of > Poplarville by J. P. Coleman and the FBI. Don't forget that it was the > Coleman-Gartin regime that called the FBI into Pearl River County. If Gartin > is elected, the next occupation forces may be the N.A.A.C.P. and specially > trained goon squads from the Justice Department. During a speaking tour for the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission in the North on 1963, Dale said, to persons asking him about the Parker case, that he didn't think the perpetrators would be caught, adding three of them already died. Parker's family left the county after the murder. Current status Despite an extensive investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the presentation of evidence before both county and federal grand juries, no indictment or conviction was ever obtained against any of the men who murdered Mack Charles Parker. The main suspects identified by the FBI have all since died due to old age. In 2009 the FBI announced they were re-opening the Mack Charles Parker case.

It was owned by Petrobras, a semi-public Brazilian oil company headquartered in Rio de Janeiro. The cost of the platform was US$350 million (currently US$). The vessel was built at the Fincantieri shipyard in Genoa, Italy in 1995 as a drilling rig. She was owned then by Societ√† Armamento Navi Appoggio S.p.A. The rig was converted by Davie Industry, L√©vis, Canada to the world's largest oil production platform. P-36 was operating for Petrobras on the Roncador Oil Field, off the Brazilian coast, producing about of crude per day. P-36 was replaced by FPSO-Brasil which is a leased vessel from SBM Offshore. The FPSO-Brasil started its lease contract with Petrobras in December 2002. Accident In the early hours of March 15, 2001 there were two explosions in the aft starboard column at or around the emergency drain tank. The first explosion was caused by an overpressure event, the second by ignition of leaking hydrocarbon vapor. At the time there were 175 people on the rig; 11 were killed. Following the explosions, the rig developed a 16¬∞ list, sufficient to allow down-flooding from the submerged fairlead boxes. Marine salvage teams tried over the weekend to save the platform by pumping nitrogen and compressed air into the tanks to expel the water, but they abandoned the rig after bad weather.

It was founded in 1854. As of 2005 it represents over 200 institutions and has over 15,800 employees. The average teacher in the district makes around $67,000 a year, with a benefit package worth around $24,000 a year. The district includes 113 elementary schools, 24 middle schools, 4 atypical schools, 10 alternative schools, 27 high schools and 25 charter schools. School board The district is governed by a five-member elected board of education. Board members are elected by district for four-year terms. Superintendent The superintendent is appointed by the school board. From 2010 through 2013 the superintendent was Bill Kowba, a retired Navy rear admiral. On February 26, 2013, Kowba announced his retirement, effective June 30. The next day, February 27, the school board unanimously appointed elementary school principal Cindy Marten as the new superintendent. The quick appointment, without a search process or community input, was described as \\"highly unusual - virtually unheard of\\" by the San Diego Union Tribune. Schools List of primary and secondary schools in San Diego organized by district  Partnership with Ocean Discovery Institute  In 2017, the district partnered with the Ocean Discovery Institute, a nonprofit that works to teach kids about science and conservation, to bring a $15 million tuition-free learning and research center to the City Heights neighborhood. The building will be a permanent campus for the nonprofit and will include two laboratories, a garden, a community kitchen and a residence for a live-in staff member. The Living Lab allows the nonprofit to reach all 10,000 students that attend and feed into Hoover High School.  Farm to School Program  In 2010, the district launched a farm to school program in an effort to bring locally grown produce to schools. The program seeks to provide students access to as much local, regional, and California grown produce as possible. In addition to produce grown at farms, the district has a Garden to Caf√© program which allows schools to be certified by the San Diego Department of Environmental Health allowing the school to grow and serve their own produce.

Parliamentary groups may elect a parliamentary leader; such leaders are often important political players. Parliamentary groups often use party discipline to control the votes of their members. Some parliamentary systems allow smaller political parties, who are not numerous enough to form parliamentary groups in their own names, to join with other parties of differing ideologies (or with independent politicians) in order to benefit from rights or privileges that are only accorded to formally recognised groups. Such groups are termed technical groups. International terms Parliamentary groups correspond to \\"caucuses\\" in the United States Congress and the Parliament of Canada. A parliamentary group is sometimes called the parliamentary wing of a party, as distinct from its organisational wing. The term or equivalent applies to a number of countries, including: Australia (party room); Austria (Club); Belgium (fractie/fraction/Fraktion); Brazil and Portugal (\\"grupo parlamentar\\" or \\"bancadas\\"); Germany (Fraktion); Italy (gruppo), Finland (eduskuntaryhm√§/riksdagsgrupp); the Netherlands (fractie); Switzerland (fraction/Fraktion/frazione); and Romania (grup parlamentar), which all have recognized multiparty systems. The political groups of the European Parliament are similar to other parliamentary groups. They are more regulated than other kinds of parliamentary groups: to gain financial support or to join committees, each parliamentary group must consist of no less than 25 MEPs from seven different EU member states. Relationship with party Generally, parliamentary groups have some independence from the wider party organisations. It is often thought improper for elected MPs to take instructions solely from non-elected party officials or from the small subset of the electorate represented by party members. In any case, the exigencies of government, the need to cooperate with other members of the legislature and the desire to retain the support of the electorate as a whole often preclude strict adherence to the wider party's wishes. The exact relationship between the parliamentary party and the party varies between countries, and also from party to party. For example, in some parties, the parliamentary and organisational leadership will be held by the same person or people, whether ex officio or not; other parties maintain a sharp distinction between the two offices. Nevertheless, in almost all cases, the parliamentary leader is the public face of the party, and wields considerable influence within the organisational wing, whether or not he or she has any official position there. Leadership A parliamentary group is typically led by a parliamentary group leader or chairperson, though some parliamentary groups have two or more co- leaders. If the parliamentary group is represented in the legislature, the leader is almost always chosen from among the sitting members; if the leader does not yet have a seat in the legislature, a sitting member of the group may be expected to resign to make way for him or her. If the party is not represented in the legislature for the time being, the leader will often be put forward at a general election as the party's candidate for their most winnable seat. In some parties, the leader is elected solely by the members of the parliamentary group; in others, some or all members of the wider party participate in the election. Parliamentary groups often have one or more whips, whose role is to support the leadership by enforcing party discipline. United Kingdom parliamentary groups ;Conservative Party: Conservative Private Members' Committee (1922 Committee) ;Labour Party: Parliamentary Labour Party =All-party parliamentary groups= In the United Kingdom Parliament there exist associations of MPs called \\"all-party parliamentary groups\\", which bring together members of different parliamentary groups who wish to involve themselves with a particular subject. This term is in a sense the opposite of the term 'parliamentary group', which designates a group that includes only members of the same party or electoral fusion. Parliamentary Friendship Groups One special kind of parliamentary groups are the Parliamentary Friendship Groups, also called Inter-Parliamentary Friendship Groups or Friendship Parliamentary Groups or Parliamentary Group of Friendship [and Cooperation]. \\"Parliamentary Friendship\\" groups are groups of congresspeople/members of parliament who voluntarily organise themselves to promote parliamentary relations between their own Parliament and another country's (or even a region's group of countries') parliament(s), and, in a broader scope, to foster the bilateral relations between said countries. Parliamentary friendship groups play an important role in New Zealand‚Äôs engagement in inter-parliamentary relations, with group members often called upon to participate and host meetings for visiting delegations from the other part, as well as often being invited by the other country's parliament to visit it. Friendship Groups do not speak for the Government of their own country, or even for the whole of the Parliament/Congress to which they belong, as they are usually self-regulating and self-fulfilling. Parliamentary Friendship Groups are active in the national congresses/parliaments of countries such as Armenia, Australia, Brazil, Germany, Israel, Laos, New Zealand, Pakistan, Peru, Romania, Serbia, Slovenia, South Korea, Switzerland, and the United States, among many others.

Born in 1881 in Neapoli, Crete (province Mirambello), Sarris interrupted his studies in 1898 in order to participate in the revolution. Despite his young age, Sarris participated in many battles. When the French army arrived at the department of Lasithi, he enlisted as a volunteer in the gendarmerie. Since he could speak many languages as well as his native Greek, (including English, French, Italian, and Turkish), Sarris became an interpreter at the headquarters of the gendarmerie in Chania. During this time, he also saved the life of a man who was drowning in the harbour of Chania. Educated through the corps, Sarris became an adjutant in 1902. The same year, he visited the Peloponnese for the first time as commander of the music corps. In 1907, Sarris was promoted to the rank of second lieutenant, serving as in Crete as commander of various police departments until 1912. In October 1912, Eleutherios Venizelos ordered the entire Cretan gendarmerie to be transported to Thessaloniki. There Sarris married Calliope Tatti, the great-granddaughter of Constantine Tattis, a member of the Filiki Eteria. In 1913, Sarris participated in the battle to capture Bulgarian troops stationed in Thessaloniki and was decorated with the silver knight's cross of the Battalion of Saviour for his services in liberated Thessalonica. In 1916, along with other citizens and officers of Macedonia, Sarris took part in the creation of the Committee of National Defence. In August 1916, as commander of the first company, he participated in the National Defence coup d‚Äô etat that intended to spur Greece's entry in World War I in favour of the entente powers.

Zhemchuzhina was the director of the Soviet national cosmetics trust from 1932 to 1936, Minister of Fisheries in 1939, and head of textiles production in the Ministry of Light Industry from 1939 to 1948. In 1948, Zhemchuzhina was arrested by the Soviet secret police, charged with treason, and sent into internal exile, where she remained until after the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953. Biography Molotov and Zhemchuzhina in 1960 Zhemchuzhina was born Perl Semyonovna Karpovskaya to the family of a Jewish tailor in the village of Polohy, in the Aleksandrov uyezd of Yekaterinoslav Governorate (today Zaporizhia Oblast, Ukraine). She joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party of Bolsheviks in 1918 and served as a propaganda commissar in the Red Army during the Russian Civil War. As a communist, she went by the surname Zhemchuzhina, which, like her birth name Perl in Yiddish, means \\"pearl\\" in Russian. In 1921, she married Vyacheslav Molotov, by then a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU). She also made a successful career in the Soviet hierarchy, serving in the Narkomat of Food Industry under Anastas Mikoyan, to become in 1939 the first female councillor of Narkom (of Fishing Industry) in the government of the Soviet Union, and was elected as a candidate to the Central Committee that year. During the 1920s, her sister emigrated to the British Mandate of Palestine. According to historian Zhores Medvedev, Stalin was highly suspicious of Zhemchuzhina. He thought that she negatively influenced Molotov, and he recommended Molotov divorce her. Medvedev, Zhores (2003) Stalin and the Jewish Question: New Analysis. Her brother, Sam Carp, was a successful businessman in the United States.Sebag-Montefiore, p. 282 The Molotovs shared an apartment with the Stalins. Zhemchuzhina and Stalin's wife Nadezhda Alliluyeva became close friends. In November 1932, Zhemchuzhina followed Alliluyeva out of a dining room after Stalin had publicly chastised his wife in the company of friends. The next morning Alliluyeva was found dead of an apparent suicide. This event is believed to have fueled a secret hatred of Zhemchuzhina by Stalin.Vasileva, p. 137. In a secret meeting of the Politburo on 10 August 10, 1939, the agenda item number 33, \\"Regarding Comrade Zhemchuzhina\\" and her alleged \\"connections to spies\\", led to a request to verify that information by the NKVD. As it was customary during the Great Purges, many of her coworkers were arrested and questioned, but the \\"evidence\\" (frequently acquired by force) against her was so contradictory that on 24 October, the Politburo concluded the \\"allegations against comrade Zhemchuzhina's participation in sabotage and spying... to be considered slanderous.\\" However, she was severely reprimanded and demoted for unknowingly keeping contacts with \\"enemy elements thereby facilitating their spying missions.\\" In February 1941, she was taken off the list of the candidates to the Central Committee. On the Eastern Front of World War II, Zhemchuzhina actively supported the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee (JAC) and befriended many of its leading members, most notably Solomon Mikhoels. She frequently attended performances by the Moscow State Jewish Theatre. Polina Zhemchuzhina befriended Golda Meir, who arrived in Moscow in November 1948 as the first Israeli envoy to the USSR.Johnson, Paul (1987), A History of the Jews. Associated University Presse. p. 527 Fluent in Yiddish, Zhemchuzhina acted as translator for a diplomatic meeting between Meir and her husband, the Soviet foreign minister. She was arrested for treason in December 1948, as she openly supported the idea of granting the region of Crimea to Jews, consequently being forced into an unwanted divorce from Œúolotov.Redlich, Shimon; Anderson, Kirill Mikhaƒ≠lovich; Altman, I. (1995) War, Holocaust and Stalinism. Psychology Press. p. 149. She was convicted and sentenced to five years in a labour camp.Vasileva, p. 154 After the death of Stalin in March 1953, she was released from captivity by Lavrentiy Beria and reunited with her husband. Her first question upon her release was \\"How's Stalin?\\" Upon being told he had died only days before, she fainted.Sebag-Montefiore, p. 651 However, Molotov now, according to Stalin's daughter, became very subservient to his wife. Molotov yielded to his wife in the same way he had previously yielded to Stalin. She died of natural causes in 1970.Sebag-Montefiore, p. 654  In fiction  Zhemchuzhina is portrayed by English actress Diana Quick in the 2017 film The Death of Stalin.

Kozachenko ran on the ticket of the Human Rights Party (HRP), the local, left- wing third party, which had already succeeded in winning two Ann Arbor, Michigan council seats in 1972.  Biography  Born in Alexandria, Virginia, Kozachenko moved around during her youth. From Toledo, Ohio, she would eventually make it to Plymouth, Michigan. She joined the Human Rights Party in the early 1970s. Kozachenko was an out student at the University of Michigan, where she received support for her progressive agenda, which included a fine of no more than five dollars for possession of small amounts of marijuana. Another part of her platform included \\"a ceiling on the amount of profit a landlord could make from rents on a building\\". Running solely against a liberal Democrat, the 21-year-old Kozachenko was elected to the Ann Arbor City Council on April 2, 1974.

Calder photographed ca. 1870. David Orson Calder (June 18, 1823 - July 3, 1884) was a prominent early pioneer settler in Utah. Biography A native of Thurso, Caithness, Scotland, he joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in 1840, and in 1851 set off for Utah as a Mormon pioneer, accompanied by his widowed mother Anne Johnston Calder, his brother George Calder, and five other siblings. A man of excellent business ability, his talents were quickly recognized. In 1857, he was appointed chief clerk to the Trustee in Trust of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and in that position organized a system of accounts and records in all the departments of the church. Between 1859 and 1870, he held office as Territorial Treasurer of the Utah Territory under Brigham Young. After a visit to his native country, where he also labored as a Mormon missionary, he was chosen business manager and managing editor of the Deseret News, the principal newspaper in Utah at the time, and even today the second-largest newspaper by circulation between Denver and San Francisco. In 1867, Calder was asked by Brigham Young to establish a commercial college in Salt Lake City, which subsequently evolved into one of the components of the University of Utah. Calder ran the Deseret Musical Association in the late 1850s, which was largely a school teaching children to sing in choruses. This group was highly acclaimed in Utah by such people as Eliza R. Snow.Hicks, Michael. Mormonism and Music, (Urbana and Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 1989) p. 93 For part of the 1860s Calder held the monopoly on music supplies in at least Salt Lake City if not all of Utah, as owner of the Calder Music Store in Salt Lake City. He supplied music journals, scores for both classical and popular pieces, and strings, reeds and other necessary aids to playing ones instrument.Hicks. Mormonism and Music. p. 95 Calder was also a founding shareholder of the Utah Central Railroad, and was elected a director of Zion's Co-operative Mercantile Institution (ZCMI), widely viewed as the first department store in the United States. He held his director position until his death in July 1884.

LIPAD was led by Arba Diallo. The militants of LIPAD were generally called lipadistes. LIPAD had its main influence in the trade union movement. The general secretary of the Voltaic Trade Union Confederation (CSV), Soumane Tour√©, was also the head of the LIPAD section in Ouagadougou. LIPAD opted for 'Popular Revolution of National Liberation' (RPLN). Initially LIPAD offered vital support to the revolution of Thomas Sankara. In May 1983 pro-LIPAD students conducted massive demonstrations demanding his release. But when Sankara opted for the 'Popular and Democratic Revolution' promoted by ULC LIPAD withdrew its support. The USSR played an important role in provoking the split away from the Sankara government. From August 3, 1983 to August 1984 LIPAD held five ministerial posts. Arba Diallo was Minister of Foreign Affairs, Philippe Ou√©draogo Minister of Equipment and Telecommunications and Adama Tour√© Minister of Information. After the break in 1984 (generally called la clarification) Diallo and Tour√© were jailed. Diallo was released in 1985 and Tour√© in 1986.

Compression Moulding is a method of moulding in which the moulding material, generally preheated, is first placed in an open, heated mould cavity. The mould is closed with a top force or plug member, pressure is applied to force the material into contact with all mould areas, while heat and pressure are maintained until the moulding material has cured. The process employs thermosetting resins in a partially cured stage, either in the form of granules, putty-like masses, or preforms. Compression molding is a high-volume, high-pressure method suitable for molding complex, high-strength fiberglass reinforcements. Advanced composite thermoplastics can also be compression molded with unidirectional tapes, woven fabrics, randomly oriented fiber mat or chopped strand. The advantage of compression molding is its ability to mold large, fairly intricate parts. Also, it is one of the lowest cost molding methods compared with other methods such as transfer molding and injection molding; moreover it wastes relatively little material, giving it an advantage when working with expensive compounds. However, compression molding often provides poor product consistency and difficulty in controlling flashing, and it is not suitable for some types of parts. Fewer knit lines are produced and a smaller amount of fiber-length degradation is noticeable when compared to injection molding. Compression- molding is also suitable for ultra-large basic shape production in sizes beyond the capacity of extrusion techniques. Materials that are typically manufactured through compression molding include: Polyester fiberglass resin systems (SMC/BMC), Torlon, Vespel, Poly(p-phenylene sulfide) (PPS), and many grades of PEEK. Compression molding is commonly utilized by product development engineers seeking cost effective rubber and silicone parts. Manufacturers of low volume compression molded components include PrintForm, 3D, STYS, and Aero MFG. Compression molding was first developed to manufacture composite parts for metal replacement applications, compression molding is typically used to make larger flat or moderately curved parts. This method of molding is greatly used in manufacturing automotive parts such as hoods, fenders, scoops, spoilers, as well as smaller more intricate parts. The material to be molded is positioned in the mold cavity and the heated platens are closed by a hydraulic ram. Bulk molding compound (BMC) or sheet molding compound (SMC), are conformed to the mold form by the applied pressure and heated until the curing reaction occurs. SMC feed material usually is cut to conform to the surface area of the mold. The mold is then cooled and the part removed. Mold and material behavior vary based on material types. New I-PRESS Servo Hydraulic technology provides end users with a greater degree of flexibility with press movement & pressure profiles and control of external devices such as automation to platen zone temperature control. With the latest of electronic servo motor to high pressure hydraulic pump users save considerable energy and the greatest in speed, distance, pressure, dwell time and burping movements. Servo Hydraulic I-PRESS Compression Molding Controller Materials may be loaded into the mold either in the form of pellets or sheet, or the mold may be loaded from a plasticating extruder. Materials are heated above their melting points, formed and cooled. The more evenly the feed material is distributed over the mold surface, the less flow orientation occurs during the compression stage. Compression molding is also widely used to produce sandwich structures that incorporate a core material such as a honeycomb or polymer foam. Thermoplastic matrices are commonplace in mass production industries. One significant example are automotive applications where the leading technologies are long fibre reinforced thermoplastics (LFT) and glass fiber mat reinforced thermoplastics (GMT). In compression molding there are six important considerations that an engineer should bear in mind: *Determining the proper amount of material. *Determining the minimum amount of energy required to heat the material. *Determining the minimum time required to heat the material. *Determining the appropriate heating technique. *Predicting the required force, to ensure that shot attains the proper shape. *Designing the mold for rapid cooling after the material has been compressed into the mold. Process definition Compression molding is a forming process in which a plastic material is placed directly into a heated metal mold then is softened by the heat and therefore forced to conform to the shape of the mold, as the mold closes. Once molding is completed excess Flash may be removed. Typically, compression molding machines open along a vertical axis. Process characteristics The use of thermoset plastic compounds characterizes this molding process from many of the other molding processes. These thermosets can be in either preform or granule shapes. Unlike some of the other processes we find that the materials are usually preheated and measured before molding. This helps to reduce excess flash. Inserts, usually metallic, can also be molded with the plastic. As a side note, remember not to allow any undercuts on the shape, it will make ejection especially difficult. Thermoplastic matrices with an inherent indefinite shelf-life and shorter cycle moulding times are widely used and examples are shown in Ref 3. Process schematic Compression molding is one of the oldest manufacturing technique for rubber molding. The process parameters includes molding time, temperature, and pressure. Usually, a 300-400 ton clamp pressure is used. The typical mold is shaped like a clam shell. The molding press looked a lot like a ladle filled vertical press used for casting aluminum. The bottom of the mold was always the cavity. Compression molding used preforms made by an extruder/wink cutter or a roller die/die cutter. Wink meaning that 2 blades meet on center to cut the extrudate to length. For example; Molding water bottles used die cut sheets from a roller die. The sheet was 3 inch by 6 inch. The first sheet was placed- one below a core and one sheet of equal size above the core, and then the top of the mold lowered by hand or by hoist to near shut. The mold was then pushed into the press. The start button hydraulically closed the vertical press to full pressure. The mold temperature was about 350 degrees. The platens of the presses were steam heated. When the cycle ended (about 3.5-4.0 Minutes) the press would open and the mold would be pulled out toward the operator. The operator would try to open the clam shell mold top, and then lean the top of the mold back against the press. Exposed is the bottle with the core still inside. While the bottle was still hot the operator would insert prongs like reverse pliers in between the bottle rubber and the steel core. The operator would then stretch the bottle at the neck over the core to free the bottle. In preparation of compression molding baby nipples and golf ball centers the preforms were extruded. The baby nipple was a kidney shape about 2 inches tall and 1/2 inch wide in the middle. The golf ball center preform had a 1 x 1 inch round slug. Both slugs were designed to stand up in the mold cavity. During the cycle the operator would load the jig with slugs. When the mold is opened, the lower platen would lower and the mold would be hydraulically pushed ou to the operator. Therein, the heat sheet (all molded parts from that cycle were joined together by a parting line rind (flash)) were placed in a transfer cart. The next cycle began by the jig being put over the mold. The slide tray was pulled and the preforms were released into the cavity of the mold. The start button moved the lower platen back into the press and the cure cycle bagan again. Therein the first cycle was complete. Each operator ran an average of 4 presses. Loading an unload was done during the cycle. The heat sheets removed from the mold were then transported to a die station. The die out station would remove the rind leaving the finished parts. With the evolution of compression molding, next was injection transfer. Basically the extruder was made part of the molding cycle. The rubber was injected into an upper heated platen station, and then pressure was applied to transfer molten rubber to the clamped mold. The design of injection transfer and improved molds were more so plastic injection molding except the platens and molds of injection transfer are heated. In contrast plastic Injections molding shoots a hot plastic into a cold mold. Workpiece geometry Setup and equipment Typical tools and geometry produced Three types of molds used are the flash plunger-type, straight plunger-type, and the \\"landed\\" plunger-type molds. The flash type mold must have an accurate charge of plastic and produces a horizontal flash (excess material protruding from the mold). The straight plunger-type mold allows for some inaccuracy in the charge of plastic and produces a vertical flash. The landed plunger type mold must have an accurate charge of plastic, and no flash is produced. Further details are explained in Ref 3.

It is located on the slopes of Monte Vulture in the northern part of the region. History The first historical mention of the hamlet of Saint Maria di Rivonigro goes back to 1152, when it is mentioned as a feudal possession of the bishop of Rapolla. In 1316 the inhabitants of Rionero abandoned their hamlet and took part in the construction of the village of Atella which had received tax concessions. The hamlet remained unpopulated during most of the 14th and 15th centuries until the influx of refugees from Albania (i.e. from Scutari and Corona) and several groups taking advantage of tax exemptions promulgated in those years. Its history overlaps with those of the neighbors Barile, Melfi, Ginestra (\\"Lombarda Massa\\") and Maschito. On April 1, 1502 Louis d'Armagnac, Duke of Nemours and Gonzalo Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba met at the Church of St. Antonio Abate in Rionero to negotiate whether France or Spain would control the provinces of Principato Citra, Principato Ultra, Capitanata, and Basilicata. In 1627 the inhabitants of Rionero were forced to change their religious observances from the Greek rite to the Latin rite by Diodato Scaglia, the Bishop of Melfi. Seriously struck by the earthquake of 1694, Rionero's population in that period did not exceed 700. Later on the Caracciolo, princes of Torella, to whom belonged the feudal rights, granted permission for the deforestation, the tillage, and the cultivation of lands occupied from the forests of the locality \\"Gaudo\\" and as a result of the consequent economic development the population endured a strong growth: in the year 1735 the inhabitants had grown to approximately 3,000, in 1752 to approximately 9,000 and by 1811 they had exceeded 11,000. In this year, on May 4, the ancient hamlet obtained the administrative autonomy as a comune from King Joachim Murat. By the mid 19th century the population grew until reaching approximately 20,000 inhabitants. The successive and periodic waves of emigration diminished the population down to roughly 14,000 inhabitants. After the Italian unification, Rionero gave the birth to Carmine Crocco, the most well-known brigand of that period. On 23 September 1943, German paratroopers of the 1st Parachute Division retreated from Atella after being shelled by Canadian artillery. They withdrew northward and for two more days they occupied Rionero. On September 24, sixteen Rioneresi were massacred in the Largo San Antonio by the paratroopers . Two days later on September 26, patrols from the Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry attached to the 1st Canadian Infantry Division entered Rionero and the neighboring town of Barile unopposed.

They performed at the Klein Karoo Nasionale Kunstefees in Oudtshoorn, South Africa (1996), at Vorst Nationaal, Belgium (1998), Canada, France (1999) (as a supporting act for Sting), Spain (1999, 2000), the Netherlands and China (2001). Interview with Dirk Steenhaut (2001) During the summer of 2000 they performed at important festivals in Belgium such as Pinkpop and Rock Werchter. In 2001 they made a much acclaimed return to the festival at Dranouter. In 2003 they made a mini tour along Flemish churches and chapels, singing a capella with the vocal support of Ludo Vandeau. This resulted in the CD \\"A la capella\\". In April 2004 they released their third CD to the market under the title Douce Victime, with covers from Jacques Brel and Herman van Veen. This time it not only contained a capella songs but also Cajun music, the London Chamber Orchestra and some World Music influences. It was recorded at the legendary Abbey Road Studios in London. With their album The Ladies' Second Song, released in September 2007, the group changed their approach and tried to reach a broader public. They could no longer be characterized as folk. The album introduces the use of electric guitars, loops and electronic beats. Their lyrics have equally undergone a thorough overhaul. Instead of drawing their lyrics from old Flemish songbooks, they have turned to poetry from William Butler Yeats, Paul Verlaine and Pablo Neruda. In 2009 they released the album La√Øs Lenski together with the cellist Simon Lenski. Members The female vocal trio part of La√Øs are three young women from Kalmthout: They are accompanied by four men: * Fritz Sundermann (electric and acoustic instruments, harmonium) * Hans Quaghebeur (squeezeboxes, hurdy-gurdy, whistle) * Ronny Reuman (percussion) * Bart Denolf (electric and acoustic bass) La√Øs has also renewed their band: *Elko Blijweert (guitar) *Bjorn Eriksson (guitar, elektronica), *Jeroen Stevens (drums) *Filip Vandebril (contrabas). *Dan Lacksman (synthesizer, former Telex (band), Dan Lacksman's Alliance, producer) did the mixing at the sound console.

He is the founder of Tune Air Sdn. Bhd., who introduced the first budget no- frills airline, AirAsia, to Malaysians with the tagline \\"Now everyone can fly\\". Fernandes managed to turn AirAsia, a failing government-linked commercial airline, into a highly successful budget airline public-listed company. He has since founded the Tune Group of companies. He is also the majority shareholder of Queens Park Rangers Football Club. He was also instrumental in lobbying the then-Malaysian Prime Minister, Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohamad in mid-2003, to propose the idea of open skies agreements with neighbouring Thailand, Indonesia, and Singapore. As a result, these nations have granted landing rights to AirAsia and other discount carriers. As of February 2014, Forbes Asia valued Fernandes' net worth at $650 million, ranking him at number 28 on the Forbes list of Malaysia's Richest. He is also an Overseas Citizen of India, owing to his partial Indian ancestry. Early life and education Fernandes was born in Kuala Lumpur on 30 April 1964 to a Goan father and a mother of mixed Indian (Malayali) and Asian-Portuguese (Kristang) descent who had been raised in Malacca, Malaysia. At a young age, he would follow his mother who sold Tupperware at Tupperware parties. He was educated at The Alice Smith School in Kuala Lumpur. Starting at age 12, from 1976 to 1983, he studied at Epsom College boarding school in England. He matriculated to the London School of Economics and graduated with a degree in accounting. Career He worked very briefly with Virgin Atlantic as an auditor, subsequently becoming the financial controller for Richard Branson's Virgin Communications in London from 1987 to 1989 before he joined Warner Music International London as Senior Financial Analyst.AirAsia 2006 Corporate Annual Report Page 34 Fernandes was admitted as Associate Member of the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) in 1991 and became Fellow Member in 1996. He is currently a member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW). Fernandes was formerly a Warner Music executive in Malaysia, and Vice President, ASEAN at Warner Music South East Asia from December 1999 to July 2001. When Time Warner announced its merger with America Online, Fernandes left to pursue his dream of starting a budget no-frills airline. In September 2001, Fernandes purchased AirAsia and became its chief executive. =AirAsia= It was through Datuk Pahamin A. Rejab, the former secretary-general of the Malaysian Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry that Fernandes came to meet with then Prime Minister, Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohamad in October 2001. Instead of starting from scratch, Mahathir advised Fernandes to buy an existing airline. AirAsia, the heavily indebted subsidiary of the Malaysian government-owned conglomerate, DRB-Hicom, was losing money. Fernandes mortgaged his home and used his personal savings to acquire the company, comprising two Boeing 737-300 jet aircraft and debts of US$11 million (RM40 million), for one ringgit (about 26 US cents), and transformed it into an industry player. One year after his takeover, AirAsia had broken even and cleared all its debts. Its initial public offering (IPO) in November 2004 was oversubscribed by 130 per cent. Fernandes says his timing was in fact perfect: after the 11 September 2001 attacks at New York City and Washington, D.C., aircraft leasing costs fell 40%. Also, airline lay-offs meant experienced staff were readily available. He believed Malaysian travellers would embrace a cut-rate air service that would save them time and money, especially in a tight economy. Fernandes estimates about 50 per cent of the travellers on Asia‚Äôs budget airlines are first-time flyers. Before the advent of AirAsia, he estimated that only six per cent of Malaysians had ever travelled by air. Fernandes' biggest achievement was to open up countries within the region to new budget carriers, which previously did not have open-skies agreements. As a result of Fernandes' lobbying in mid-2003, Dr Mahathir brought up the idea with leaders from neighbouring countries. Those nations subsequently granted landing rights to AirAsia and other discount carriers. In Thailand and Indonesia, AirAsia holds a minority stake in the respective local companies. Thai AirAsia, a joint venture with Shin Corporation, Thailand‚Äôs largest telecommunication conglomerate, took to the skies in Feb 2004 and has to date carried over 1 million passengers in its first year of operations. PT Awair, re-launched as a low fare airline on 8 December 2004 and subsequently renamed Indonesia AirAsia, presently serves 5 domestic destinations in Indonesia. In 2018 Fernandes announced that more low- cost carrier terminals would be developed, and confirmed that while AirAsia needed new planes, he had not yet decided on an aircraft manufacturer. Fernandes‚Äô plans to expand include bidding on the operations and maintenance contract for Clark International Airport in the Philippines. In February 2020, Fernandes step aside as CEO of AirAsia as Airbus bribery allegations probed.CEO Fernandes and chairman step aside as Airbus bribery allegations probed\\" chief Tony Fernandes steps aside amid Airbus probe\\" A month later, Fernandes was reinstated as CEO of AirAsia after the Airbus bribery allegations probe was cleared by Britain's Serious Fraud Office of any wrongdoing.says review cleared Airbus sponsorships; Tony Fernandes reinstated to CEO\\" =Other ventures= In 2007, Fernandes started a hotel chain, Tune Hotels, based on the no frills concept. It has properties in Britain, Australia and the Far East. In March 2012, he served on the International Advisory Board of Global March to Jerusalem, which aims to \\"mobilize the international community in solidarity with Palestinians and to protect Jerusalem.\\"http://gm2j.com/main/concept-and-objectives/ A joint statement was issued, signed by the various members of the Board, including Fernandes.http://gm2j.com/main/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/GMJ-IAB-press- release.pdf In 2013, he hosted The Apprentice Asia, the Asian spin-off of the reality game show The Apprentice, in which a group of aspiring young businessmen and women compete for the chance to work with Fernandes. In 2018, he was named the head of Malaysia Stadium Corporation (MSC) by the Malaysian Youth and Sports Ministry. Caterham Group Fernandes is the founder of the Caterham F1 Formula One team, which began racing in as Lotus Racing and raced in as Team Lotus. On 2 July 2014, Caterham F1 was sold to a Swiss and Middle Eastern consortium. On 16 December 2009, Fernandes accepted a \\"challenge\\" from Richard Branson, a fellow airline boss and the owner of Lotus' fellow F1 newcomers Virgin Racing. The losing team's boss would work on the winner's airline for a day dressed as a stewardess. Fernandes joked \\"The sexier the better. Our passengers will be delighted to be served by a Knight of the Realm, but knowing Richard, the real challenge will be to prevent him from asking our guests 'coffee, tea or me?' That would be scary.\\" In addition, the team produced a poster depicting Branson in an Air Asia uniform. However, the date of the flight was delayed several times: first because of Branson breaking his leg, then because of the royal wedding, finally because of a fire at the Necker Island. On 19 December 2012, Fernandes announced that Branson would honour his bet in May 2013. Branson ultimately honoured the bet on 13 May 2013. Caterham Racing, also created by Fernandes, competes in the GP2 Series. On 27 April 2011, Fernandes announced that his company had purchased Caterham Cars. Football Fernandes is a fan of English club West Ham United and was involved in talks regarding a potential takeover of the club in May 2011, at which stage it looked as if he was going to acquire a 51 per cent stake in the club. Former West Ham chairman Andrew Bernhardt even flew to Kuala Lumpur to try and finalise the deal, but the two parties failed to agree on the price. It was just one month later when Fernandes made another offer to buy 51 per cent of the club, although co-owners David Sullivan and David Gold rejected his bid. Sullivan told the Evening Standard: \\"He wanted 51% of the club for two bob.\\" Sullivan's comments started a war of words on Twitter. \\"It was a good offer with good money and brought in good people,\\" said Fernandes. \\"Gold and Sullivan can say whatever they want. I have been a lifelong fan and would have brought good money, good ideas, new people and a new belief. As for PR stunts. Wow. They are always in the press making huge claims. Were we not supposed to be in Europe. Now we have been relegated. Two sacked managers. All good players will be sold. No new training ground which is the most important ingredient I feel. Look at how many injuries we have. And more investment into the academy.\\" Tony Fernandes' seat at Loftus Road On 18 August 2011, just three months after Queens Park Rangers' promotion back to the Premier League following a 15-year absence, Fernandes was unveiled as their majority shareholder, having bought Bernie Ecclestone's 66% stake. He was also named as chairman of QPR Holdings Ltd. While Neil Warnock remained as the club's manager for their return to the top-flight, a run of eight Premier League games without a win eventually led to his sacking. Mark Hughes was quickly named as his replacement, signing a two-and-a-half-year deal in the process. Despite their new manager, QPR's poor run of form continued, which left them fighting for Premier League survival on the final day of the 2011-2012 season. Relegation rivals Bolton Wanderers needed a win to have any chance of survival, but could only muster a draw with Stoke City, meaning QPR were safe, despite losing 3-2 to Manchester City after Sergio Ag√ºero's injury-time winner - a goal which stole the Premier League title from arch-rivals Manchester United on goal difference. Mark Hughes led the club into the 2012-2013 season, but after just four points from 12 games and without a single win - one of the worst starts in Premier League history - Fernandes dismissed Hughes. Fernandes hired former Tottenham Hotspur manager Harry Redknapp on 24 November 2012, but even he was unable to solve QPR's problems. Following a goalless draw with relegation rivals Reading on 28 April 2013, both teams were relegated to the Championship. Tony Fernandes watching QPR v Newcastle alongside Les Ferdinand at Loftus Road, May 2015 Speaking to the media just one week after Rangers' relegation back to the Championship, Fernandes said he had been exploited since he took over at Loftus Road. After investing an estimated ¬£50 million into the club, he said: \\"I don't think I will be exploited any more. I think I allowed myself to be exploited but that's my choice. Agents are trying to get the best contracts and there are no two ways about it, I had to pay premiums. I've seen all of the parts that make football quite - maybe immoral is a strong word - but they would sell their grandmother to do something. It's all part of the football ecosystem.\\" In 2013 Fernandes noted in an interview that he would leave the club if he was unable to ‚Äúfix‚Äù their problems. In a 2017 interview, after a year in the Premier league in 2014-15 and three years relegated to the Championship league from 2015-18, Fernandes admitted having made several mistakes, but also noted that much had been achieved. He restored the former QPR badge and colours and engaged more with the community near Loftus Road. In August 2018, Fernandes noted that his tenure was ‚Äúfast coming to a close‚Äù.‚Äù. He planned to step down and hand over the position of co- chairman to vice chairman Amit Bhatia, a change finalised on 15 August 2018. On September 11, 2016, Fernandes declared that he has no interest in being the President of the Football Association of Malaysia (FAM), despite his answer to an impromptu question which was blown out of proportion.

Misleadingly called 'The Hermit's Cave', the site in reality comprises a complex of shelters, terraced gardens, exotic plants, water-cisterns, dry- stone walling and linking bridges, stairways and paths that stretch intermittently across more than a kilometre of the escarpment. Made single- handedly by a reclusive Italian migrant, Valerio Ricetti, these structures involved the moving of hundreds of tons of stone and earth, together with the ingenious incorporation of natural features in the landscape. The site is recognised for being a rare example of an Australian hermit's domain. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 12 January 2007.  History  Over the period from around 1929 to 1952 the hermit Valerio Ricetti fashioned an outcrop of rock shelters and rock overhangs on a ridge-top site outside Griffith into his living quarters. The historical archaeological complex includes rock shelters (some modified into cave-like enclosures), dry- stone walling, stone stairways and paths, terraced gardens, water cisterns, remnant plantings, inscriptions and rock murals. Over more than two decades Ricetti developed, utilised and occupied structures along the one-kilometre- long site where he lived in isolated seclusion from 1929 to 1941. He continued to work on the site until 1952, when he returned to Italy, where he died in the same year. =Valerio Ricetti's history as told by others= Valerio Ricetti was born in north Italy around 1897-98 in Sondalo, a small town in a valley in the Italian Alps, close to the border with Switzerland. In his home region he was apprenticed as a cement and stonemason and gained experience working on road and rail tunnel constructions. With the declining economic situation and impending war in Europe, his uncle encouraged him to migrate to Australia to seek better opportunities. Aged 16 or 17, Ricetti arrived at Port Pirie, South Australia, in October 1914. He worked at Port Pirie for a few months before heading off to Broken Hill where he stayed at the Ceccato boarding house (signed on as being 18 years old) and obtained work in the mines with Valentino Ceccato and Francesco Bicego. During his time at Broken Hill Ricetti learned to speak English which he spoke well although he retained an accent. Later, Ceccato and Bicego left Broken Hill and came to Griffith. Ricetti continued to work in the mines until 1918 when he left Broken Hill, heartbroken from being spurned by a barmaid he intended to marry. This love affair devastated him and scarred him for the rest of his life.P Ceccato 2001:15,43, pers.comm. 2004; B Ceccato pers.comm. 2004; J Bicego pers. comm. 2004; J Bugno n.d: 1, cited in Caillard 2005: 28-29 Ricetti travelled to South Australia where he worked at various jobs for several years. His life experiences fed his disillusionment with humanity. With a year's timber- cutting wages in his pocket he departed for Adelaide where he visited a brothel. On leaving he found that he had left his wallet behind, but the bouncer would not allow him back in. He hurled a rock through a window, was chased and ended up in Adelaide Gaol. On release he left for Victoria. In Melbourne he intended to pawn his one remaining possession, a coat, but a passer-by who offered to pawn it for him never returned. He moved on to Burrinjuck, NSW, in 1928. In the decade since he left Broken Hill Ricetti had befriended many people but few of these friendships had lasted long. Leaving Burrinjuck, he set out on his own. For the next twelve months or so Ricetti followed the Murrumbidgee River downstream to the Lachlan River then upstream to Hillston, NSW. Griffith's newspaper, \\"The Area News\\", reported in 1977 that \\"He finally found work on a riverboat of the period. He later explained that he had been a sailor on the Murray and that his \\"ship\\" had been the Mary Anne. The Mary Anne was one of the many boats that steamed the Murray, Murrumbidgee and Lachlan, and it would appear that Ricetti was to learn more about life during the period he spent on board her; perhaps something about love, unrequited. On the walls of his cave he etched a brief, pathetic epitaph to those days - two hearts and an anchor\\".(Fenwick 1977: 8 ) Ricetti walked along the railway line to Griffith, with no idea of where he was heading. He was searching for a location where he could be on his own. That did not eventuate and he reached in Griffith in 1929. Arriving on the outskirts of Griffith, a sudden rainstorm drove him to seek shelter on Scenic Hill. Next day he explored the area. About a quarter of the way down from the hilltop, he found a huge overhanging rock which was dry underneath. Close by he saw two reservoirs full of water and fruit and vegetable farms at the foot of the hill. To the west was the town rubbish dump which teemed with rabbits. Tired of travelling, and with no money left, he later recalled saying to himself \\"I have found the Garden of Eden\\". Ricetti decided to construct a private utopia, by making the cave his permanent home. He scavenged the rubbish dump where he found a half-worn out shovel, a pick head and an axe head. He felled tree branches to make handles for them. He believed himself to be the only Italian in the area and kept entirely to himself. In reality, his old compatriots Ceccato and Bicego from Broken Hill had settled nearby and increasing numbers of Italian migrants were settling the area. Ricetti cleared and decorated the caves, creating massive stone galleries and pathways, cliff-side gardens and floral painted rock walls. He worked at night and early in the morning, to remain unseen, eventually moving hundreds of tonnes of rock. Digging under the huge rock, the earth that he threw out rolled down the steep hillside. So he set about building a stone retaining wall. As it was gradually back-filled, he increased the retaining wall height and length. Finally it reached 9 metres long and 2.4 metres high. This gave him a level surface of 2.7 to 3.7 metres outside the cave. Portions on either side of the rock were closed off with stones and clay mortar leaving an opening just over 1 metre wide and 2 metres high to enter the cave. Outside he planted flowers on both sides of a path that led to the top of the retaining wall. Turning right, he then followed along the top of the wall for about 6 metres where he had made a pathway a little over half a metre wide that led to and from the cave. Under the lookout, some 36 metres to the right, is a formation of three high rocks in a half circle. The centre one is fashioned by nature as a dome. In front of these rocks he built a stone retaining wall about 1.5 metres high and 4.5 metres long. This he filled with earth to level it, and then he planted more flowers. He called it his \\"shrine\\". Further west he found an area that was partly surrounded by a sheer wall of rocks jutting out from the sloping hill. He made flower beds with pathways leading from one bed to another. On the sloping side he built small stone retaining walls. Near a corner of this complex were four large rocks, joined together front and back, with one either side forming a central open space about 3 metres in diameter. The top was open. On the garden side was a hole about a metre deep that he had to crawl through to get inside. Ricetti dug down in front of the hole to make it large enough to walk through, but just over half a metre down he found rock. At this level he dug inwards, carrying the soil up and forming more flowerbeds. At the centre of this \\"room\\" was a rock a little over half a metre high and too large to move. So with stone and clay mortar he shaped it into a table. At the entrance he made a stairway so he could walk down to the cave. For the top he laid thin poles across like a lattice, planting grapevines and wisteria to form a canopy. Close to these gardens he had a couple of places to hide when people came. These places were not developed in any prominent way. But over the other side of the hill, some 180 metres from the main cave, he built a stone walled circular cave amongst shrubs, around a large tree with a peephole which afforded him another place to hide when people appeared. In 1935 Ricetti fell off some rocks, breaking his leg and badly bruising his ribs. A passing swagman found him and notified an ambulance that took Ricetti to hospital where the Government Medical Officer, Dr E.W. Burrell, attended to him. He became a celebrity when the enormity of his work on Scenic Hill was discovered. During Ricetti's hospitalisation Wade Shire Council came to his assistance, resolving 'to attend to and maintain the gardens during the hermit's indisposition. Councillor Lenehan stated that the recluse, by vast labour, had added considerably to the interest of Griffith outlook and it was up to the Council to do something for him.' After leaving hospital Ricetti returned to his reclusive existence. Anxious to pay Dr Burrell for his treatment, however, Ricetti slipped into town at night and worked in the doctor's garden. After a few visits the doctor caught him and explained to Ricetti that payment was made to him by the Government. A friendship grew between the two, which Ricetti valued greatly. Dr Burrell would visit Ricetti regularly at the cave and leave boxes with useful items such as clothes and shoes. In 1937 a Mr Agostini wandered up the hill one night and came face to face with Ricetti. In conversation the names Ceccato and Bicego came up and Ricetti commented that he had worked at Broken Hill with people of those names. Agostini informed Ceccato of his contact with Ricetti and the acquaintance between Ceccato, Bicego and Ricetti was renewed. On weekends they would pick up Ricetti, and take him to places where he met many people. They would try to coax him to come and live among them, but the hill remained his home. By now Ricetti had become more socialised and did not shy away from people. During World War II Ricetti was interned as an enemy alien. He had allegedly lined one of his caves with newspapers that included reports of Hitler with the swastika prominently displayed (Fenwick 1977: 9 ). He was put to work building roads and instructed his captors on how to improve their road-building methods. After four months he was assessed, declared a deranged person and moved to a mental institution at Orange, NSW. Six months later he was released and sent back to Griffith where the police met him and told him to get a job, find accommodation and not go back to the hill. Asked if he could name someone he gave Valentino Ceccato's name, who agreed to take him in. From 1942 to 1952 Ricetti worked and lived at the Ceccato's, first on Valentino Ceccato's farm until 1948 and then on the farm of Valentino'a son and daughter-in-law, Bruno and Nora Ceccato. From 1943-47 Ricetti worked in the orchards and vineyards alongside Valentino's son, Peter Ceccato, to whom he told stories of his life.P. Ceccato 2001: 43, 45; B & N Ceccato pers. comm. 2004, cited in Caillard 2005: 29, 32-33 But Ricetti was always a loner, working away from others on the farm and sleeping in the pruning shed. He was troubled by visions and obsessed with his cave: \\"Disturbing him also was an illusion - a \\"man and woman in the sky\\". Very real to him, they towered above him, demanding that he do more and more work.\\" By all accounts these visions stemmed from his disastrous love affair in Broken Hill.Ceccato 2001: 37; pers. comm. B & N Ceccato and P. Ceccato 2004, cited in Caillard 2005: 33 Ricetti spent as much time as possible at his cave where he stuffed his earnings from Ceccato into clefts in the rocks before Ceccato opened a bank account into which he paid Ricetti's wages direct (Fenwick 1977: 9 ). In May 1952 Ricetti was in bad health and used the 1400 pounds he had amassed in wages to return to Italy and his brother, with whom he had lost contact. He clearly intended to return as he bought a return ticket and left his savings in the bank. But in November 1952 Bruno Ceccato received notice from the Municipality of Sondrio Vatellina that Ricetti had diedB&N;Ceccato pers. comm. 2004P Ceccato 2001: 47, cited in Caillard 2005: 34Peter Kabaila, \\"Griffith Heritage\\", 2005: 105-108W.H. Fenwick, \\"The Area News\\", 3 February 1977, 8-9Bobby Caillard, \\"Recovering the Lost Landscape of Valeri Ricetti: the archaeology of an individual\\", BA (Hons) thesis, University of Sydney, 2005: Vol 1, 28-34. =Valero Ricetti's history as documented= There is very little documentation on Valerio Ricetti's life in Australia and it is almost exclusively confined to records of his internment, dated 1942-45, held by National Archives Australia. Much of the information contained in these records is in the form of Ricetti's answers to a Military Police Questionnaire prior to his internment in 1942. But very little of this information provided by Ricetti can be substantiated by other documents. Additionally, a photocopy of an employee record for BHP mines was obtained by both J Bicego and J Bugno. Photocopies of most documents are reproduced in Bobby Caillard, \\"Recovering the Lost Landscape of Valeri Ricetti: the archaeology of an individual\\", BA (Hons) thesis, University of Sydney, 2005: Vol 2, 1-30. Additional enquiries were undertaken by the Heritage Office with National Archives Australia (NAA); State Record Offices in South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales; Glenside Campus (formerly Parkside Lunatic Asylum), Adelaide and Griffith Base Hospital, NSW. There is no record of Ricetti's date of birth. In 1942 it is recorded as 12 March 1897Caillard 2005: 7, 8, 11,12 and also as 12 March 1903. The latter date is likely incorrect as Ricetti would have been only 11 or 12 years old on arrival in Australia. Ricetti's arrival date and port of entry into Australia cannot be verified. In 1942 he reports that he arrived in 1914 at Adelaide, date and ship's name unknown, that he paid his own fare and that he had no family or friends in Australia on arrival.Caillard 2005: 7, 8, 11, 12 But there is no record of his entry into a South Australian port as either a passenger, crew member or ship's deserter over a wide date range around 1914. Neither is he recorded as a passenger entering through a port in Western Australia or Victoria over an equally wide date range. Passenger shipping arrivals into Sydney for this period are not indexed, therefore were not searched (Heritage Office pers. comm. 2006: NAA Adelaide, Perth, Melbourne; State Records SA, NSW; Public Record Office Victoria). On arrival in Australia, Ricetti claims to have spent \\"about one year in a mental hospital in South Australia, after which he went to Alice Springs and on to the Northern Territory\\".Caillard 2005: 8 One month later Ricetti claims that he worked in the Broken Hill mines from 1914‚Äì17 and on the railways at Grafton, NSW, from 1917-21 after which he came to Griffith where he was employed by various Italian farmers for a few days at a time. The records from 1942 also note Ricetti's two court appearances in the period before his arrival in Griffith: at Adelaide on 7 October 1919 for a breach of the War Precautions Act (Aliens) (offence unspecified), fined five pounds or one month's hard labour and at Barham, NSW, on 14 October 1927 for stealing, fined ten pounds or two months hard labour. The same records note that Ricetti claimed to have left his passport at the Adelaide Police Station but that enquiries failed to confirm this and that examination of his finger prints revealed that Ricetti was also known in Adelaide as Frank Pullen and Frank Muler.Caillard 2005: 12, 14 Of these claims, only Ricetti's employment at the Broken Hill mines in 1917, his 1927 fine for stealing and a possible gaol sentence in Adelaide in 1919 can be substantiated in the documentary record. Records of the former Parkside Lunatic Asylum, Adelaide (the only such institution in South Australia at that time) for the period 1914-20 reveal no entries under various possible spellings of Valerio Ricetti or his two aliases.Caillard 2005: 41 Ricetti's employment at Broken Hill mines can be verified for only 9 days, 17 to 26 May 1917, after which date he left. The record shows that he resided at Eyre St, South Broken Hill which was the Ceccato boarding house at 305 Eyre Street. He is recorded as Vito Ricetti and his age given as 22 years (instead of 20 years), his age probably falsified to gain employment.Caillard 2005: 3 The Adelaide Register of Prisoners has no record for Valerio Ricetti but has two entries for Franz Recitti in 1919 and 1920. The related documents have not been sighted by the Heritage Office but these entries may tally with one of Ricetti's aliases and relate to either his 1919 breach of War Precautions or the Adelaide brothel offence related by Peter CeccatoCeccato 2001: 17-23(Heritage Office pers. comm. 2006: State Records SA). There is no record of Ricetti working on the railways at Grafton between 1917 and 1921 (Heritage Office pers. comm. 2006: NSW State Records). The Police Charges and Summons Book, 1924-28 for Barham, NSW, (on the Murray River) records that Ricetti pleaded guilty on 14 October 1927 to stealing 40 dozen oranges for which he was fined 10 pounds in default of two months hard labour in Deniliquin Gaol (Charles Sturt University, NSW, Regional Archives). During World War II, \\"enemy aliens\\" resident in Australia were required to register under National Security (Aliens Control) Regulations, to report to the police station each week and to carry an identify card at all time to avoid arrest (Dalton & Polkinghorne 1990: 845). Ricetti's internment record and associated documents held by the NAACaillard 2005: 16-25 confirm his internment as an enemy alien between May 1942 and December 1943. The documents also reveal the difference in assessment of Ricetti the individual by the local and state police services. Ricetti was arrested by Griffith Police on 4 March 1942 for failing to register as an alien and to report to police. Ricetti's statement that he was unaware of the requirement to register was accepted by the local police. He was charged with \\"being deemed insane and found wandering at large\\" but was discharged five days later following examination by Dr Burrell (who had attended him in Griffith Hospital in 1935) who pronounced him \\"completely harmless and therefor (sic) not a subject for medical attention in an institution\\". In his reports to the Commissioner of Police, Sydney, the Officer-in-Charge of Griffith Police noted that Ricetti spoke German, French and Italian quite fluently. He commented on Ricetti's residence on Scenic Hill, his \\"considerable skill in stonework\\", and his work \\"to beautify the hill\\" which Ricetti had asserted to him to be \\"his mission in life\\" The officer noted that Ricetti had \\"long been regarded as an eccentric\\" and the \\"difficulty is experienced in getting anything like a coherent story from him\\". He concluded that Ricetti was a \\"harmless mental deficient who lives the life of a hermit\\" and that it was not proposed to begin proceedings against him.Caillard 2005: 8, 11 Military Police Intelligence, Sydney, however, thought otherwise. They required Ricetti's completion of a four-page questionnaire and a search of his premises for \\"literature of subversive or disloyal nature\\" or \\"prohibited possessions\\". The search carried out on 10 April 1942 by Griffith Police found nothing.Caillard 2005: 10, 13 The questionnaire appears to have been completed in two stages with handwritten entries by Griffith Police and later, typed entries (that include Ricetti's court appearances) probably entered by Military Police Intelligence in Sydney. These typed entries give a more critical assessment of Ricetti. They comment that Ricetti resides \\"in the highest and most secluded locality in the District ... about a mile from the various petrol depots, electricity substations and water channels in the Irrigation Area\\" and that he \\"is known to wander about at night\\". The entry continues that Ricetti \\"is regarded with a good deal of suspicion\\"‚Äîa statement that does not square with Griffith Police's assessment of Ricetti as \\"harmless\\" and \\"eccentric\\"‚Äîand concludes \\"We are of the opinion that this alien should be interned.\\".Caillard 2005: 8, 12-15 Ricetti was arrested on 3 May 1942 on Scenic Hall and removed to the Liverpool internment camp (south-west of Sydney), from where he was transferred to Cowra in July 1942. Records show he was released from Camp 12, Cowra, on 16 December 1942 but also transferred from Cowra to Loveday internment camp, SA, on 21 April 1943.Caillard 2005: 18, 23 One account suggests Ricetti was moved during his internment to a mental institution in Orange, NSW, for treatment.Ceccato 2001: 35 & 9 However, there is no record for that period of Ricetti being admitted to Bloomfield Hospital, Orange (at that time the only mental institution in Orange).Caillard 2005: 44 Ricetti was released from Loveday on 5 December 1943 and taken to Sydney, where he gave his new place of abode as Farm 219 Yoogali, Griffith (Valentino and Elizabeth Ceccato's farm). A year later (30 November 1944) Ricetti notified his change of abode from Farm 219 Yoogali to Scenic Hill, Griffith. This would indicate the earliest official acceptance of his occupation of this Crown Reserve as his place of abode, even though he is remembered as living on the Ceccato farm at that time. Ricetti's departure from Sydney cannot be confirmed as NSW passenger shipping lists for 1952 are not indexed and therefore were not searched. The absence of documentary verification for much of Ricetti's story can be at least partly explained by the loss or destruction of many records over time. =European traditions of hermitism and North Italian cultural influences= Ricetti's experience aligns with European traditions of hermitism that are not essentially religious in origin whereby an individual makes a conscious (rather than an enforced) choice to remove himself or herself from society, often after a long period of solitary wandering (Ricetti trekked on foot for a decade from Adelaide through north Victoria and southern NSW to Griffith). Ricetti's choice of landscape conforms to many European hermit dwellings. Caves are frequently chosen, particularly those located on steep hillsides or in mountains. In this respect Ricetti would have drawn on his Italian upbringing in a mountain valley of north Italy in making his choice of dwelling on the escarpment of the southern edge of the McPherson Range‚Äîa prominent ridge top location in the predominantly flat Riverina Plain. Spiritual iconography is common even among hermits living outside a recognised religious tradition. North Italian cultural influences can be seen in Ricetti's use of: :(a) skilled stonemasonry with dry stone walling combined with backfilling to create terraces for cultivation on steep and rocky slopes. The use of stone for farmhouses and the skill of dry stone (with no mortar) constructions are prominent in this region as is the use of terracing for cultivation. :(b) planting of grape vines and fruit trees :(c) the \\"Chapel\\" with its painted Christian iconography.Bobby Caillard, \\"Recovering the Lost Landscape of Valeri Ricetti: the archaeology of an individual\\", BA (Hons) thesis, University of Sydney, 2005: Vol 1: 134  Description  Dry stone walling at the Hermit's Cave complex The Hermit's Cave Complex is a collection of rock shelters and rock overhangs (several of which have been modified by Ricetti to create cave-like enclosures) with elaborate stoneworks and earthworks created by Ricetti, all of which are located along a long, narrow ridge top site outside Griffith. Ricetti's work is over more than one kilometre along the south-eastern face of Scenic Hill which is a escarpment on the southernmost part of the McPherson Range. Scenic Hill is now adjacent to the western edge of the Collina residential suburb. The southern and northern edges of the site are defined by Ricetti's hide-outs constructed in rocky outcrops. The western perimeter is currently defined by the road reserve boundary of Scenic Drive although there are possibly remnants of other constructions west and north-west of this road. The area of the nominated site comprises 16.16 ha with a length of 1150 m and varying widths of approximately 120 to 190m. The archaeological remains of the site are located in discrete areas along the length of the site across a distance of over one kilometre. From south-east to north-west these remains are grouped as follows: ;1) Far South Rock Shelter (possible main western hide-out) * 40-step stone stair; * hide-out with open rock shelter with three large stone blocks placed in a row; * small, natural shelter with a narrow passage leading into a small chamber containing natural stone blocks that form a window opening. ;2) South Rock Shelter (possible first dwelling) Rock shelter containing: * 18-step stone stair; * dwelling with partly intact stone enclosure walls; * remnant stonework (remains of the wall and another stone stair). The small size of the shelter and absence of rock inscriptions and rock murals suggests this was a short-term dwelling used by Ricetti before he constructed and moved into the second, more substantial dwelling. ;3) Southern Garden and Rock Shelter (possible second dwelling) This dwelling is associated with two gardens, three cisterns, a rock shelter popularly known as \\"La Scala\\" (Opera House) and its inscriptions. It is recorded in historical photographs and is remembered to have been built and occupied before the third dwelling. A) Rock Shelter containing: * east stone stair leading to the garden; * bottom stone stair from the east, leading to a narrow passage between two boulders with a low wall into the dwelling; * dwelling, being a rock shelter overhang that was walled off, containing a stonework window; * top stone stair rising from the rock shelter overhang; * west stone stair into a narrow passage between two boulders leading to a second, small chamber that contains a large flattish stone). This chamber is thought to have been a cistern. * holes (chiselled out) that were used to support timber trellis structures. B) Gardens The largest and most complex zone of the site being 60 metres long and 35 metres wide. Located along the base of a cliff face below the ridge top with a drop in level of 10 metres. :i) Upper Garden. Designed as three terraces with cisterns, connecting stairs, paths and a dwelling. Its remnant features are earthwork terraces with stone retaining walls; metal materials (steel sheet, wire) for shoring terraces and construction; remnant fig plantings; remnant yucca plantings and yucca plantings that have invaded the surrounding area. :ii) Lower Garden. Contains the best -constructed and best-preserved example of Ricetti's stonework. It comprises an earth-filled stone retaining wall forming an elevated walkway. C) Cisterns :i) Uppermost Cistern. Situated in the top terrace and fed by moisture from the cliff face. :ii) Second Cistern. Situated outside the north-eastern retaining walls of the garden at the middle terrace level and fed by moisture from the cliff face and surface run-off. :iii) Lower Cistern. Adjacent to and below the lower garden and fed by surface run-off from the gardens and possibly the top cistern. D) Natural Amphitheatre-Shaped Rock Shelter featuring: * stone retaining wall to form a bridge; * stone staircase remnants; * location of a bush timber ladder that was used to provide access to a rock shelf; * rock inscriptions at the base of the cliff with a mixture of Christian and other motifs. i) Rock shelter popularly known as 'La Scala' (or the 'Opera House') * a place of suitable acoustics where Ricetti used to stand and call out. His voice could sometimes be heard as far away as the town ii) Rock inscriptions at 'La Scala': Rock inscriptions occur in three areas. a) The lower rock gallery is at the base of the cliff and contains a mixture of Christian and other symbols: * a court jester's face and hat, with three crucifixes representing the hill of Calvary; * three fishes (an early Christian symbol) intertwined; * apocalyptic message, incomplete, in back to front lettering in a combination of Latin and Italian: 'paratus nun qua no...'('be prepared'). b) Partly up the rock face, near the stone stair to the \\"La Scala\\" rock shelf, is the date 1918 and initials RV ( Valerio Ricetti's, back to front). This date predates Ricetti's known arrival in the area. c) Inscription on a rock floor of later date is (also predates Ricetti's arrival). E) Two Stone Stairs * upper stone stair built with low risers (possibly for carrying rocks from the quarry); * hidden stone stair, winding down through a passage between boulders. ;4) Central 'Hide-Outs' * stone stair on contour forming part of the main track linking the gardens with the 'Main Cave'; * natural chamber formed by two boulders with stone blocks at the entrance (the lower hide-out); * small natural rock shelter with no stonework (the upper hide-out). ;5) Main Cave (possible third dwelling) This dwelling is the best-known and best-maintained of Ricetti's works. It is associated with other structures that are popularly known as \\"Kitchen\\", \\"Gun Post\\", \\"Art Gallery\\", \\"Chapel\\", stone stair and \\"The Cliffs Cave\\" inscription. A) Rock Shelter containing: * stone-walled sleeping chamber with doorway; * painted rock murals featuring flower and ship's anchor motifs; * second chamber with fireplace, known as the 'Kitchen'; * remnant fig planting; * remnant oleander planting; * back-filled retaining walls separating the dwelling from the \\"Gun Post\\". B) 'Gun Post' A stone earthwork resembling a small fortification. Historical photographs show a gang plank bridge connecting it to the third dwelling. No evidence of a real defensive purpose has been found, but it appears to have been used by Ricetti to monitor his surroundings. C) 'Art Gallery' A separate chamber connected to the third dwelling. This was remembered to contain a cinema poster of King Kong. D) 'Chapel' * natural rock amphitheatre with views to the east; * earthwork terraces with stone retaining walls; * various materials (steel, wire) still in place and visible, for shoring up and reinforcing the terraces; * rock mural with cross and the initials VR to the left of the cross and RV to the right of it. E) Stone Stair 90-step remnant of stone stair constructed by Ricetti. F) \\"The Cliffs Cave\\" Inscription A historic inscription (predating Ricetti's occupation) reads \\"H.M. Alf. Irv. Driver The Cliffs Born Nov. 21/-70\\". Alf Driver was the pioneer selector of the local property, The Cliffs. The inscription is chiselled in elegant, cursive script into the floor of the rock shelter which is located near a hazardous rock ledge that is reached by a narrow passage between two boulders. From the rock shelter there is a magnificent 180 degree view of the Riverina Plain and the slopes of the hill below. The site clearly has a larger and previous history of use by settlers and travellers and probably an even older Aboriginal association. ;6) North Rock Shelter (1) A narrow, rectangular shelter with two built walls, it is well concealed at the foot of a sheer rock face. Located about 100 metres north-east of the third dwelling, it is connected by pathways to the third dwelling, ridge top and North Rock Shelter (2). ;7) North Rock Shelter (2) Defining the northern limits of the Hermit's Cave Complex, it is located about 100 metres north-east of North Rock Shelter (1): * enclosed rock shelter, well concealed and out of sight from both the ridge top and from below; * 30-step stone stair connecting the shelter to the ridge top and the bottom of the hill. The top section (10 steps) is steep and narrow, descending between two rock faces. * faded white diagonal lines painted on one internal rock face. ;8) Site of Western Shelter This site is known through archival photographs and supported by oral history although no physical evidence of the structure has been found. Its stone structures were probably dismantled for use in gardens. Its location has been given as 'just to the west of the track [Scenic Drive] about 100-200 yards in on the flat, north-north-west of the cave's old entrance, north of the look-out'. Archival photographs indicate a worked stone structure with large, smooth-finished rectangular blocks framing a wooden doorway with jambs and curved lintel of \\"wilga timber\\". The structure was a small room built around a hollow wilga tree at the base of which Ricetti had built a fireplace so that the tree could serve as a chimney. The door and a peephole allowed Ricetti to view the approaches from all sides. Ricetti used the structure as both a kitchen and a hide-out but abandoned it because of visitors or vandals.Peter Kabaila, 'Hermit's Cave, Conservation Management Strategy for Griffith City Council', 2006Bobby Caillard, \\"Recovering the Lost Landscape of Valeri Ricetti: the archaeology of an individual\\", BA (Hons) thesis, University of Sydney, 2005) = Condition = The gardens were reported to be in a fair condition as at 19 June 2006, although erosion of clay mortar supporting the stone masonry work on the retaining walls is a concern. Erosion is equally a concern on the retaining walls to the \\"Chapel\\". Graffiti is a concern, with graffiti damage to some of Ricetti's original rock art. Some of the staircases are still in a pristine condition. Taking into account the nature of the rudimentary construction, the site is remarkably intact. The site has considerable archaeological potential. There are possibly remnants of constructions to the west and north-west of Scenic Drive (outside the nominated curtilage) but their locations are unknown. The site retains most of its original design and material. Much of the original stonewalling is intact. It has suffered some damage due to graffiti, vandalism and erosion of original material. = Modifications and dates = The landscape has been modified on several occasions between the 1970s and 1990s. The most prominent modifications ( by Council) are the Sir Dudley de Chair look-out area above the \\"Chapel\\" and a steel hand-rail along the stairs from the lookout to the \\"Chapel\\" together with work undertaken by the Apex Club in the 1970s, being the construction of a 60-step stone stair from the lookout to the \\"Chapel\\". Apex have also attempted to reconstruct part of the \\"Main Cave\\". Apex, however, used cement mortar, which deviated from Ricetti's utilisation of clay-mortar and dry-stone techniques.  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries The cultural landscape and historical archaeological complex known as the Hermit's Cave Complex has state significance as a rare example in New South Wales of a documented, extensive and relatively intact complex of recluse dwellings that is an outstanding twentieth century archaeological site containing rare examples of rock art, historic graffiti, numerous stone structures, earthworks and remnant cultivation. The Hermit's Cave Complex has multicultural heritage values that constitute material evidence of the response of one individual, the Italian migrant Valerio Ricetti, to the impact of migration in the period after World War 1. The site documents Ricetti's resourcefulness and skill and demonstrates a rare interpretation and integration of natural landscape and materials to create not just a shelter but, over time, an elaborate complex comprising hide-outs, a lookout and modified cave-like enclosures supplemented by retaining stone walls, linking bridges, stone stairways, paths and earthworks with terraced gardens, remnant plantings and water cisterns. The Hermit's Cave Complex illustrates a European tradition of hermitism that is rarely found in New South Wales. The Hermit's Cave Complex has outstanding educational, interpretative and research potential as a resource for the study of historical archaeology and ethnic history. Hermit's Cave Complex was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 12 January 2007 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Hermit's Cave Complex has state significance for its capacity to demonstrate a historical pattern of migration experiences in material form. Ricetti's story of a young, non English-speaking migrant with no family or friendship networks in Australia is significant for the individuality of his response (in an Australian context) to the pressures and opportunities of migration. Ricetti's retreat from human interaction was marked initially by a decade of aimless solitary trekking around inland southern New South Wales and adjacent parts of Victoria and South Australia that ended with his decision to set down roots, build a retreat and live off the land in seclusion when he sighted the rocky ridge top of Scenic Hill on the outskirts of Griffith. Over a 23-year period Ricetti did more than merely construct a habitable shelter on the ridge top. He invested a vast amount of time and physical labour in considerably modifying the landscape to suit his purposes and to create an aesthetically pleasing environment. He backfilled a total area of 505 square metres to create terraces for cultivation on the steep slopes of the escarpment. The soil in the cultivated areas has been identified as fine and pebble-free in an otherwise stony environment which indicates a sieving process (Ricetti could access and adapt materials located on the town dump nearby). The terraces were planted with a variety of edible and ornamental plants which demonstrates aesthetic as well as practical values. Ricetti collected, shifted, cut and placed thousands of cubic metres of stone to create the series of retaining walls around the ten identified terrraces and the extensive stairways that link the elements of the site. The plantings have been identified as including grape vines, fig, olive and stone- fruit trees. These take several years to fruit which would indicate Ricetti viewed this cultivation as long term investment. Other plantings such as tomato, passion-fruit vines, sweet peas and lettuce would have required intensive care and nurturing in Griffith's semi-arid climate, evidenced by Ricetti's construction of water cisterns. This level of activity and attention demonstrates that Ricetti valued his dwelling with a high degree of both physical and emotional investment as a permanent home and a long-term project.Caillard 2005: Vol 1: 139-141 Oral history indicates he was driven by \\"visions\\" to work on his project. Ricetti's response can perhaps be understood in the context of European traditions of hermitism, especially in the Alpine regions of northern Italy where his choice of landscape echoes that of many European hermit dwellings. North Italian cultural influences can be seen in Ricetti's use of : :(a) skilled stonemasonry with dry stone walling; :(b) planting of grape vines and fruit trees; and :(c) the chapel cave with its painted Christian iconography. Ricetti's is an important story in the narratives of \\"difference\\" or \\"the other\\", not only for his response to society but also for society's response to him. At the local level the community understands his \\"difference\\" and values his work on Scenic Hill: his hospitalisation engenders community support during his absence and, in World War II, the local police consider him no threat and his work to be valuable. At the impersonal level of state jurisdiction, however, his \\"difference\\" is viewed unfavourably. He is demonised for his nationality and nonconformity and interned as an enemy alien, suspicions compounded by his 14 years of social alienation. These distinctions may reflect wider patterns in wartime internment processes. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The Hermit's Cave Complex is of local significance for its association with the extensively documented life of Valerio Ricetti, the subject of local folklore as the \\"hermit\\" of Scenic Hill. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Hermit's Cave Complex is significant at state level as an example of multicultural heritage and as an aesthetically distinctive cultural landscape. It demonstrates through its landmark qualities an individual's adaptation of the landscape and natural materials to provide shelter, food and an aesthetically pleasing environment as a response to social dislocation and isolation. As such it is in the tradition of European ascetic/hermit retreat dwellings created to provide for seclusion from society. The landmark qualities of the Hermit's Cave Complex align with European traditions of hermitism that are not essentially religious in origin. Ricetti's choice of landscape conforms to many European hermit dwellings. Caves are frequently chosen, particularly those located on steep hillsides or on mountains. In this respect Ricetti would have drawn on his Italian upbringing in a mountain valley of north Italy in making his choice of dwelling the escarpment of the southern edge of the McPherson Range‚Äîa prominent ridge-top location in the predominantly flat Riverina Plain. Spiritual iconography is common even among hermits living outside a recognised religious tradition. Ricetti's work reflects Italian hermit traditions of painting and inscribing important images and texts on cave walls. North Italian cultural influences can be seen in Ricetti's creative and technical achievements, specifically in his: :(a) skilled stonemasonry with dry stone walling combined with backfilling to create terraces for cultivation on steep and rocky slopes. The use of stone for farmhouse building and the skill of dry stone (with no mortar) constructions are prominent in this region and are reflected in the stonework of the Hermit's Cave Complex, as is the use of terracing for cultivation. :(b) planting of grape vines and fruit trees :(c) decoration of the chapel cave with its painted Christian iconography. The site is a popular place for meditative walks, in a setting reminiscent of ancient European archaeological monuments. The stonework and gardens recall the stone structures and intensively modified rural landscapes of northern Italy. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Hermit's Cave Complex has social significance at the local level for the Griffith community, and in particular the Italian community of Griffith and the surrounding Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area, as an important element of local folklore. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Hermit's Cave Complex is of state significance as an outstanding example of a twentieth century historical archaeological site that is suitable for further research. It has outstanding educational, interpretative and research potential as a resource for the study of historical archaeology, multicultural heritage and migration history: * as an example of \\"ethnic nostalgia\\", reproducing aspects of structures and modified landscapes of rural Italy in an alien setting (specifically the stonework and gardens) * as a complex historical archaeological site * as a migration story of an individual's response to the impact of settlement, internment and poverty. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Outstanding level of rarity. The Hermit's Cave Complex has state significance as a rare, documented example of a known hermit dwelling and a document of recluse living, especially in terms of the extent and complex nature of the site. Some of the known examples of hermit and/or cave dwellings evidence some construction techniques similar to Ricetti's, such as dry stone walling, some terracing and water provision. But these examples are either on a considerably smaller scale, are evidence of community activity or are constructions by squatters who were not hermits. The known examples of cave dwellings appear to be linked to squatting, mainly in the 1930s depression. None of these examples show similar evidence of the extent and complexity of Ricetti's construction works at the Hermit's Cave Complex. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The Hermit's Cave Complex has state significance for being representative in its physical forms of some aspects of the small number of known examples of recluse living in New South Wales, most of which are in the Sydney region. Enquiries have revealed a number of previously occupied caves in New South Wales that reflect either depression era occupation, squatting by individuals who are not necessarily hermits, or more elaborate constructions by communities of fringe dwellers. Many cave shelters throughout the national parks that flank Sydney --- the Royal to the south, the Blue Mountains to the west and Kuring-gai Chase to the north --- were depression-era dwellings of the 1930s, such as the former fishermen's caves at Cape Solander (Botany Bay), the caves in the Domain in the city, and Poet's Cave in Lane Cove National Park, Sydney, that was inhabited by a hermit who was also believed to be responsible for a biblical inscription on a rock in the park. In north-western New South Wales caves were occupied at Lightening Ridge and in the Warrumbungle Ranges, the latter reputedly used by cattle duffers (dates unknown). Other \\"hermit-type\\" dwellings like the Crater Cove huts on Sydney Harbour and huts along the Hawkesbury River grew in popularity in the 1930s depression but originated earlier and continued their existence later as communities of fringe dwellers. The Crater Cove huts were first constructed by squatters during the 1920s in the Middle Harbour bushland and remained inhabited until 1988. They were built on the low cliffs and wide rock platforms facing the harbour with water tanks carved into the rock, stone built chimneys, paths and edging. A group of Hawkesbury River huts (with boat access only) were occupied by one family group and included wells, terracing of the ridges, gardens, extensive dry stone walling and linking pathways. A large and impressive two-storey, Swiss chalet style dwelling was constructed by a squatter over a 40-year period from the 1920s at Hungry Beach in Kuring- gai Chase National Park. The building had circular stone walls, its own water supply, polished concrete floors and all fixed furniture (sofas, kitchen benches, cupbords, wardrobes etc) was built of polished ferrocement. During World War II it was occupied by the United States military. The builder was not a hermit and he sourced (and paid for) building materials that he brought in by barge from Sydney. The building was reputedly demolished in 1969 while the occupant (then in his eighties) was hospitalised. The Hermit's Cave Complex is representative of some of these construction techniques as a class or type of item and is the finest known example of its type.

The H3 receptor has also been shown to presynaptically inhibit the release of a number of other neurotransmitters (i.e. it acts as an inhibitory heteroreceptor) including, but probably not limited to dopamine, GABA, acetylcholine, noradrenaline, histamine and serotonin. The gene sequence for H3 receptors expresses only about 22% and 20% homology with both H1 and H2 receptors respectively. There is much interest in the histamine H3 receptor as a potential therapeutic target because of its involvement in the neuronal mechanism behind many cognitive H3R-disorders and especially its location in the central nervous system.Rapanelli, Maximiliano. ‚ÄúThe Magnificent Two: Histamine and the H3 Receptor as Key Modulators of Striatal Circuitry.‚Äù Progress in Neuro- Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry 73 (February 2017): 36‚Äì40 Tissue distribution * Central nervous system * Peripheral nervous system * Heart * Lungs * Gastrointestinal tract * Endothelial cells  Function  Like all histamine receptors, the H3 receptor is a G-protein coupled receptor. The H3 receptor is coupled to the Gi G-protein, so it leads to inhibition of the formation of cAMP. Also, the Œ≤ and Œ≥ subunits interact with N-type voltage gated calcium channels, to reduce action potential mediated influx of calcium and hence reduce neurotransmitter release. H3 receptors function as presynaptic autoreceptors on histamine-containing neurons. The diverse expression of H3 receptors throughout the cortex and subcortex indicates its ability to modulate the release of a large number of neurotransmitters. H3 receptors are thought to play a part in the control of satiety. Isoforms There are at least six H3 receptor isoforms in the human, and more than 20 discovered so far. In rats there have been six H3receptor subtypes identified so far. Mice also have three reported isoforms. These subtypes all have subtle difference in their pharmacology (and presumably distribution, based on studies in rats) but the exact physiological role of these isoforms is still unclear. Pharmacology Histamine =Agonists= There are currently no therapeutic products acting as selective agonists for H3 receptors, although there are several compounds used as research tools which are reasonably selective agonists. Some examples are: *(R)-Œ±-methylhistamine *Cipralisant (initially assessed as H3 antagonist, later found to be an agonist, shows functional selectivity, activating some G-protein coupled pathways but not others) *Imbutamine (also H4 agonist) *Immepip *Imetit *Immethridine *Methimepip *Proxyfan (complex functional selectivity; partial agonist effects on cAMP inhibition and MAPK activity, antagonist on histamine release, and inverse agonist on arachidonic acid release) =Antagonists= These include: *A-304121 (No tolerance formation, silent antagonist) *A-349,821 *ABT-239 *Betahistine (also weak H1 agonist) *Burimamide (also weak H2 antagonist) *Ciproxifan *Clobenpropit (also H4 antagonist) *Conessine *Failproxifan (No tolerance formation) *Impentamine *Iodophenpropit *Irdabisant *Pitolisant *Thioperamide (also H4 antagonist) *VUF-5681 (4-[3-(1H-Imidazol-4-yl)propyl]piperidine) Therapeutic potential The H3-receptor is a promising potential therapeutical target for many (cognitive) disorders that are caused by a histaminergic H3R dysfunction, because it is linked to the central nervous system and its regulation of other neurotransmitters.Bolam, J.

This receptor has been proposed as a target for treating sleep disorders. The receptor has also been proposed as a target for treating neuropathic pain. Because of its ability to modulate other neurotransmitters, H3 receptor ligands are being investigated for the treatment of numerous neurological conditions, including obesity (because of the histamine/orexinergic system interaction), movement disorders (because of H3 receptor-modulation of dopamine and GABA in the basal ganglia), schizophrenia and ADHD (again because of dopamine modulation) and research is underway to determine whether H3 receptor ligands could be useful in modulating wakefulness (because of effects on noradrenaline, glutamate and histamine).Sadek, Bassem, Ali Saad, Adel Sadeq, Fakhreya Jalal, and Holger Stark. ‚ÄúHistamine H3 Receptor as a Potential Target for Cognitive Symptoms in Neuropsychiatric Diseases.‚Äù Behavioural Brain Research 312 (October 2016): 415‚Äì430 There is also evidence that the H3-receptor plays an important role in Tourette syndrome.Cox, Joanna H., Stefano Seri, and Andrea E.

The Lavochkin La 5 & 7, number 149. Profile publications Ltd., P.O. Box, 1a North Street, Leatherhead, Surrey, UK. p. 3 It entered production in 1940 and saw service in a number of Soviet aircraft. It powered the Tupolev Tu-2 and Pe-8 bombers and the inline engine-powered LaGG-3 was adapted for the ASh-82 producing the famous Lavochkin La-5 fighter and its development, Lavochkin La-7, additionally the Lavochkin La-9 with its Lavochkin La-11 escort variant and Ilyushin Il-14 airliner were created around the engine. Over 70,000 ASh-82s were built. They were built in the 1950s to 1960s era under licence, both in Czechoslovakia (as the M-82) by the Walter (Motorlet) factory in Prague-Jinonice and in the German Democratic Republic by the VEB Industriewerke Karl-Marx-Stadt.  Variants * ASh-82-111 (M-82-111) - First mass-produced ASh-82, with carburettors and one two-speed supercharger. Engine had lubrication and carburettor problems in harsh winter conditions. * ASh-82-112 (M-82-112) - Improved M-82-111 with longer Time between overhaul (TBO) and better reliability. Redesigned carburettors, oil pumps, gear, turbocharger and reinforced pushrods. * ASh-82F (M-82F) - Identical to ASh-82 except for longer Time between overhaul and improved cooling and lubrication system. * ASh-82FNV (M-82FNV) - Improved M-82F with direct fuel injection, power output increased to 1,380 kW (1,850 hp) compared to the 1,268 kW (1,700 hp) of the M-82 and M-82F. * ASh-82FN (M-82FN) - Series production M-82FNV, used by Pe-8 long-range bombers and Lavochkin La-5FN and La-7 fighters. * ASh-21 (M-21) - Single-row 7-cylinder version of ASh-82 for Yakovlev Yak-11 trainer, entered production in 1946, used also to power e.g. the Mil Mi-1 helicopter.

The black metal plates mid-engine are baffles that re-direct airflow from the front of the engine (on the left in this image) over the heads of the cylinders. * ASh-82T (M-82T) - New version of the ASh-82FNV developed in the early fifties for civilian aircraft. Previous version twin superchargers were replaced with a large single-speed compressor attached to an after-cooler (the critical altitude was 2,000 m, 6,561 ft). New alloys were used and some components were upgraded, thus reducing maintenance operations. Special care was put into reducing the engine noise level and an optional exhaust double silencer was available. The engine had a new fuel injection system and improved specific fuel consumption. A four-blade high efficiency propeller, the Typ AV-50m, was developed for the 82T version. Take-off power was 1,900 hp (1,417 kW) at 2,600 RPM, with 95 octane Avgas. Maximum continuous power was 1,630 hp (1,215 kW). At 85 octane Avgas and minor modifications, power output was rated at 1,700 hp (1,268 kW).ORDER. Chief of Civil Air Fleet.

The ASh-2TK had a two-stage two-speed supercharging system with intercooler (similar to the ASh-73) that compromised the engine's long TBO. Finally the ASh-2TK was discarded and a new version was developed, the ASh-4K, with an experimental variable-speed turbocharger and after-cooler, which allowed a cruising altitude of 11,000 m (36,089 ft). The engine had 82.4 litres (5,030 cu in) and 4,000 HP (2,985 kW) at 2,600 RPM (dry). The Ash-2K (ASh-4K) version had 4,700 HP (3,507 kW) wet, with a water-methanol system. For political reasons, these engines were prematurely installed in Tupolev Tu-4LL testbeds at the end of 1950, when the prototypes' initial tests had barely begun. The engines had various teething and overheating problems, and required a long testing period. Most of the flaws were fixed in the mid-fifties, but the production was cancelled: in those days, the priority for the Soviet Air Force were the turboprop and jet engines. *Dongan HS-7 A Chinese license built copy of the ASh-82V, and the chosen engine for powering modern 21st century reproductions of the Focke-Wulf Fw 190A built in Germany. *Dongan HS-8 A modified version of the Dongan HS-7 which \\"combined the main body and supercharger of the HS-7 with the reduction gear and propeller drive of the Shvetsov ASh-82T\\".

With roots in the heavy Conestoga wagon developed for the rough, undeveloped roads and paths of the colonial East, the covered wagon spread west with American migration. The Conestoga wagon was far too heavy for westward expansion. Typical farm wagons were merely covered for westward expansion. Heavily relied upon along such travel routes as the Great Wagon Road, the Mormon Trail and the Santa Fe and Oregon Trails, covered wagons carried settlers seeking land, gold, and new futures ever further west. With its ubiquitous exposure in 20th century media, the covered wagon grew to become an icon of the American West. The fanciful nickname prairie schooner and romantic depiction in wagon trains only served to embellish the legend. History A Prairie Schooner on the Cariboo Road or in the vicinity of Rogers Pass, Selkirk Mountains, c. 1887, by Edward Roper (1833-1909). Mormons crossing the frozen Mississippi River from Nauvoo, Illinois Once breached, the moderate terrain and fertile land between the Appalachians and the Mississippi was rapidly settled. In the mid-nineteenth century thousands of Americans took a wide variety of farm wagons across the Great Plains from developed parts of the Midwest to places in the West such as California, Oregon, Utah, Colorado, and Montana. Overland migrants typically fitted any sturdy wagon with five or six wooden or metal bows that arched high over the bed. Over this was stretched canvas or similar sturdy cloth, creating the distinctive covered wagon silhouette. Prairie schooner is a fanciful name for the covered wagon, drawing on their broad white canvas covers, romantically envisioned as the sails of a ship crossing the sea.The Prairie Schooner Got Them There, American Heritage Magazine For \\"overlanders\\" migrating westward, covered wagons were a more common mode of transportation than wheelbarrow, stagecoach, or train. Oxen were the most common draft animal for pulling covered wagons, although mules and horses were also used. Authors of guidebooks written for emigrants noted that oxen were more reliable, less expensive, and nearly as fast as other options.Unruh, pp. 107-08.

Although it didn't receive critical acclaim, the film was a commercial success at the box office.  Story  Govindarajulu (Chiranjeevi) is a mesthri (construction worker) who drinks a lot and lives a carefree life. On the other hand, his son Siddartha alias Siddu (Chiranjeevi) is a popular TV show host and more disciplined man ‚Äî the opposite of his father. Siddu gets Govinda married to Shanti (Tabu) to sober him. Siddu is in love with Swetha (Rimi Sen), the daughter of a big-time contractor named Veerendra (Prakash Raj). Veerendra happens to be a childhood friend of Govinda but currently dislikes him due to his behaviors and social class. Thus, he agrees to get Swetha married to Siddu but tells Govinda that in order for the marriage to take place, he must distance himself from Siddu, as Veerendra does not like Govinda's influence on Siddu. Govinda, being the loving and caring father that he is, decides to fake kicking Siddu out of the house so that the latter can marry Swetha. During the time of the engagement, though, Siddu breaks it in front of everyone, publicly revealing the condition that Veerendra has given. It is revealed that Govinda's friend had told Siddu about the condition, and it is the sole reason that Siddu was kicked out of the house. Siddu returns to Govinda, and a vengeful Swetha decides to separate the family and have Siddu for herself. She begs Govinda to forgive her and take her as his daughter-in-law, as she had not known about Veerendra's condition. Govinda says that if Siddu wants her, then he is willing to have her in the house because he holds no grudge and wants Siddu to be happy. Siddu decides that as long as Govinda is happy, he is too, and agrees to marry Swetha. Swetha moves into the house and starts making sketches to create differences between Govinda and Siddu with the help of her cousin-brother Sathi Babu (Sunil), but she fails miserably. The rest of the film is about if she succeeds or not. Meanwhile, Govinda has differences with a big-time rowdy and contractor named Satti Pehelwan (Pradeep Rawat).

Organisations include Tatura Milk Industries, Goulburn- Murray Water's corporate headquarters, Jacobs Engineering Group, Department of Environment and Primary Industries (Victoria), as well as major regional processing plants for multinational corporations such as Unilever and Snow Brand Milk Products. Attractions include the Cussen Park wetlands, the Wartime Camps, an effluent pond just off the main street and Irrigation Museum. The name of the town is an Aboriginal word meaning \\"small lagoon.\\"  History  The Post Office opened on 1 February 1875. The Tatura Magistrates' Court closed on 1 January 1990. = World War II internment camps = Several internment camps were set up around Tatura, Rushworth and Murchison (Dhurringile) during World War II. Four of these were for civilians, and three were for prisoners of war. Between 1940 and 1947, there were 10,000 to 13,000 people in the camps at different times. Before the war, Britain was home to around 73,000 Germans, who had left Germany due to the rising tensions and the rise of the Nazi regime in the country. Many of these were also young male Germans who had been in schools in Britain before the outbreak of WWII. It was believed that many of these refugees were spies, and they were shipped out of the country, predominantly to Australia (on the HMT Dunera) and Canada. In 1941, German Templers were shipped from Palestine and interned for the duration of the war, which led to the establishment of the Temple Society Australia. After arriving in Australia on 25 August 1941, the Templer's established themselves in Camp 3 in Tatura. Because of their previous internment during World War I, they were experienced in living in those conditions, and established a school and a kindergarten, as well as developing work routines to prevent depression. After the War, the majority of Templer families remained in Australia. In 1941, Major Julian Layton arrived from England on a mission. Layton, a Jew like many of the Dunera internees, managed to secure the release of many of them if they enlisted in the British or Australian Army. At the end of the war all of the Dunera internees were released. Among the more notable internees were the crew of the German auxiliary cruiser Kormoran, taken prisoner following the battle between HMAS Sydney and the Kormoran. There were also German detainees from the Anglo- Soviet invasion of Iran. The Tatura German Military Cemetery () is the final resting place of 351 German civilians and servicemen who died during internment in World War I and World War II.  Agriculture  The Tatura Show is held yearly in March and International Dairy Week (which is the second largest dairy show in the Southern Hemisphere) in January each year attracting over 6,000 exhibitors, vendors and onlookers from Australia as well as overseas.  Food  Tatura Hot Bread has won prizes in the Professional Section of The Great Australian Vanilla Slice Triumph in 2006 and again in 2007.The Great Australian Vanilla Slice Triumph The Taste of Tatura Food and Wine Festival is held on the first Sunday in March drawing many of the region's locals. Sport Tatura has many sporting facilities located within the town, including Australian Rules football ovals, Soccer fields, Cricket pitches, Tennis courts, Lawn Bowls greens, a multipurpose Indoor Stadium and the 18-hole Golf course of the Hilltop Golf Club. The town has an Australian Rules football team competing in the Goulburn Valley Football League, the Tatura Bulldogs. Tatura is home to the Tatura Racecourse Reserve, where the Tatura & Shepparton Racing Club Inc hosts a minimum of three full TAB race meetings each season, including the iconic Italian Plate Festival in December - a celebration of the local Italian community and culture - and the Tatura Easter Cup.

Manor Just before the Norman conquest of England Hacun, a Dane, held the manor of Meretone and also the nearby manor of Piddington. The toponym is derived from the Old English for a tun, hamlet or settlement by the mere. The Domesday Book records that by 1086 Countess Judith of Lens, a niece of William I of England held the manor. Countess Judith was betrothed to Simon I de Senlis but refused to marry him and fled England. William I confiscated her estates and allowed Simon to marry Judith's eldest daughter Maud. Simon received estates including Merton as the honour of Huntingdon. In 1152 or 1153 Simon's son Simon II de Senlis, Earl of Huntingdon-Northampton gave Merton to the Knights Templar. In 1185 the manor covered seven hides, making it their largest estate in Oxfordshire. In 1312 Pope Clement V ordered the Templars' dissolution and their English estates were confiscated by Edward II, who granted Merton to the Knights Hospitaller in 1313. In 1540 the Hospitallers were suppressed in the Dissolution of the Monasteries and surrendered Merton to the Crown, which left it in the possession of the Templars' tenant, William Mablyston of Ludgershall, Buckinghamshire. =Harington baronets= In 1554 the Mablystons' lease expired and Robert Doyley of Chiselhampton and his son John acquired the manor. John died in 1593 and his widow Anne married Sir James Harington in 1601. In 1640 Sir James Harington, 3rd Baronet married Katherine, daughter of Sir Edmund Wright, Lord Mayor of London. Sir James was a Member of Parliament from 1646 until 1655 and during the English Civil War he served as a major- general in the Parliamentarian army. After the English Restoration his baronetcy was forfeited for life in 1661 under the Indemnity and Oblivion Act. Sir James fled to the European mainland and died in exile. Sir James' father- in-law had remained a Royalist throughout the Civil War and Commonwealth, which helped Lady Katherine to claim she did not share her husband's politics. In 1662 the Crown granted letters patent placing the estate in trust, and upon Lady Katherine's death in 1675 it passed to her and Sir James' eldest son Sir Edmund Harington, 4th Baronet. The Harington baronets owned Merton until Sir James Harington, 6th Baronet ran up large sporting debts and in 1740 mortgaged Merton to Sir Edward Turner, 2nd Baronet of the neighbouring parish of Ambrosden. Sir James was a Jacobite who supported the Stuart claim to the United Kingdom. In 1747, he joined Charles Edward Stuart in exile and in 1749 Sir Edward Turner (later Page-Turner) obtained Merton by foreclosing the mortgage. The Page-Turner baronets (later Dryden baronets) retained Merton until 1930. =Manor house= The Doyleys built the manor house in the latter part of the 16th century. It is thought to have been L-shaped, but after Sir Edward Page-Turner bought the manor in 1749 he had the south wing demolished and the surviving wing turned into a farmhouse. In 1838 the house's oak panelling was sold. In 1860 the house was modernised and its Elizabethan porch, gables, stone roof and mullioned windows were all removed. The house now has sash windows. The original kitchen and stone-arched cellar survive, and the cellar includes a well. A dairy wing was added late in the 19th century. The house's 17th century square, two-storeyed dovecote also survives. The house is now a nursing home. Church and chapel St Swithun's parish church: chapel in the south aisle, with 14th century Decorated Gothic east window monument to Elizabeth Poole (died 1621), now mutilated and neglected The Church of England parish church of Saint Swithun is Decorated Gothic, built early in the 14th century. It has a south aisle, linked with the nave by an arcade of four bays. Late in the 15th century the Perpendicular Gothic clerestory was added to the nave. The chancel windows and one window in the south aisle are also Perpendicular Gothic. The font is much older than the church, dating from late in the 12th century. St Swithun's had a north aisle but it was demolished in the 15th or 16th century. Its arcade of three bays was blocked up and remains in the north wall of the nave. The tower had a spire but it became unsafe and in 1796 it was removed. St Swithun's most notable monuments are wall-mounted ones in the chancel commemorating John Doyley (died 1593) and his wife, Elizabeth Poole (died 1621) and Richard Harrington (died 1712). The Poole monument has strapwork and Tuscan columns but is significantly mutilated and in want of restoration. A turret clock for St Swithun's was made late in the 17th century. Its original dial had only an hour hand. In 1867 this was replaced with a new dial that has both hour and minute hands. Some time after 1989 a new turret clock was installed; the 17th century original is now displayed in the nave. The Gothic Revival architect Charles Buckeridge restored St Swithun's from 1865 until 1872. St Swithun's had been decorated with mediaeval wall paintings, once brightly coloured but by 1823 described as \\"dim with age\\". During the restoration work it was found impossible to remove the layers of whitewash covering them. St Swithun's is a Grade I listed building. In the Edwardine Inventory of 1552 St Swithun's had three bells and a Sanctus bell. In 1795 the bell tower had a ring of seven bells but the churchwardens obtained permission to sell five of them to pay for a new lead roof for the church. By the 1950s there were only two bells: one cast by Richard Keene of Woodstock in 1694 and the other cast in 1887. In 1565 the Crown sold the advowson and rectory to William Petre, who in 1572 gave both to Exeter College, Oxford. The ecclesiastical parish of Merton is now part of the Benefice of the Ray Valley. A Congregational chapel was built in 1890. It was still in use for worship in 1953. Economic and social history The Plough public house, which has ceased trading St Swithun's parish church: late 17th-century turret clock, now displayed in the nave The Knights Templar established a watermill in the parish. The earliest known record of it is from 1156 to 66. West of St Swithun's is a rubblestone tithe barn that may have been built in the 15th century or early 16th century. It has a queen post roof and is thatched. In the late 20th century it was converted into four homes. There were small enclosures of land in the parish in the 14th and 16th centuries but an open field system of farming prevailed until 1763. In the 1761 Parliamentary election Sir Edward Turner entered the House of Commons as Member of Parliament for Penryn in Cornwall. In 1762 Sir Edward got Parliament to pass an Inclosure Act for the parish of Merton. This extinguished all common land rights in Merton and assigned most of the land to Sir Edward. In 1814 one of the earliest National Schools to be established under the auspices of the National Society for Promoting Religious Education was opened in Merton. A new stone-built school building, complete with lodging for the matron, was completed in 1829. Ownership and management of the school were transferred to the vicar and churchwardens in 1870. The school was enlarged in 1872 and 1893. The number of pupils then declined and in 1913 the school was closed and 12 pupils were transferred to Ambrosden. In 1930 the house and school were sold and became a private home. Merton used to have a public house, the Plough Inn, whose building is partly Tudor. In the 2000s the owners closed the pub and applied to Cherwell District Council for planning permission to redevelop the site for housing. The council refused the application but the pub remains closed. Since the Plough's closure the village has held real ale festivals at least once a year in its village hall.Merton Village Website Charlton Services bus on route 94 at its terminus outside Balliol College, Oxford Bus Charlton-on-Otmoor Services bus route 94 provides Merton and neighbouring villages with a Monday to Saturday service between Bicester and Oxford via Arncott and Islip.

He was educated at Bryanston School and the Architectural Association. He was a pupil of architect Raymond Erith, with whom he formed the partnership Erith & Terry. Quinlan Terry is a well-known representative of New Classical architecture and the favourite architect of Charles, Prince of Wales. He has a keen interest in how traditional architecture contributes to the debate on sustainability and has lectured frequently on the subject. Quinlan Terry continues to practice full time with partners Roger Barrell and Eric Cartwright under the name Quinlan Terry Architects LLP. Work Brentwood Cathedral Richmond Riverside, London, 1984‚Äì87 =In the United Kingdom= Terry works principally in classical Palladian architectural styles. The firm, Quinlan Terry Architects LLP continues the architectural style of the practice which was started by Raymond Erith in 1928, and specialises in high quality traditional building, mostly in classical idioms. The practice is based in Dedham, Essex, and employs 12 staff. A book about the firm's work written by David Watkin, entitled Radical Classicism: The Architecture of Quinlan Terry (New York: Rizzoli International Publications), was published in 2006. The first work by Raymond Erith on which Quinlan Terry had a major role was the new house Kings Waldenbury, Hertfordshire, completed for the Pilkington family in 1971, when new building in a classical manner was deeply unfashionable. During the three-year construction period of the house, Terry kept a diary, published later, in which he bemoaned the modern world and stoically defended his conservative, reformed, evangelical faith. His design for the 1992 Maitland Robinson LibraryQuinlan Francis Terry Architects ‚Äì Maitland Robinson Library, Downing College at Downing College, Cambridge, won the Building of the Year Award in 1994. One of his best known works is Brentwood Cathedral in Essex. This is radical extension of a nineteenth century Roman Catholic Gothic revival church is in the English Baroque manner owing much to James Gibbs and Thomas Archer and makes little or no attempt to be in keeping with the older building. Terry's new work has a portico based on the south portico of St Paul's cathedral designed by Sir Christopher Wren. Unusually, all five classical orders of architecture were used and Terry has said in lectures that he views classical architecture as an expression of the divine order. During the 1980s he was also appointed by Margaret Thatcher, then Prime Minister, to renovate the interiors of 10 Downing Street, restored 40 years previously by Raymond Erith, Terry's teacher, after war damage. Terry's work there is more assertive than Erith's. In Gloucestershire, he designed Waverton House, where he used the style made popular by Matthew Brettingham in the late 18th century, featuring a central staircase lit from above, surrounded by rooms on both floors. In 1989, he designed a series of three new villas for the Crown Estate Commissioners in Outer Circle in London's Regent's Park. Building in the park was controversial but said to be in the spirit of the Prince Regent's original though unrealised intentions for the park, which was to contain numerous villas for Regency courtiers surrounding a new royal palace. Terry's three new villas have near-identical plans, based on Palladio's Villa Saraceno, but the external elevations vary, showing respectively Gothic, Italian Mannerist and muscular Neo-classical features in the manner of William Chambers. Six villas were eventually built between 1989 and 2002. In the mid-1990s, Terry designed the restoration of St Helen's Bishopsgate, controversially turning the orientation of the medieval church through 90 degrees, moving or removing some fittings, and reworking its previous Tractarian Anglican layout into a Georgian stripped-back meeting house plan informed by the precepts of Reformation theology, in tune with its current firmly evangelical congregation. Also in the 1990s, he designed a castle for the Barclay brothers on their private island of Brecqhou in the Channel Islands. Terry designed the external envelope of New Margaret Thatcher Infirmary at the Royal Hospital Chelsea, with Steffian Bradley Architects as the lead consultant and planners for the building; a new Georgian Theatre for Downing College Cambridge; new offices, retail and residential development at 264‚Äì267 Tottenham Court Road, London; offices and retail at 22 Baker Street, London; and Queen Mother Square, Poundbury; mixed use development Richmond Riverside =In the United States= His works in the US include the Abercrombie Residence, a classical mansion based on Marble Hill House, Twickenham, London. Complete with a piano nobile approached by an external staircase, it has a pediment supported by Corinthian columns. The house is constructed of Kasota limestone, with Indiana limestone dressings. Appraisal Terry's architecture has been championed by David Watkin, who wrote the monograph Radical Classicism: The Architecture of Quinlan Terry (2006), and by Roger Scruton who called it \\"one long breath of fresh air\\" in his Spectator article \\"Hail Quinlan Terry: our greatest living architect\\".Scruton, Roger, \\"Hail Quinlan Terry: our greatest living architect\\", The Spectator 8 April 2006. > Quinlan Terry is the single most distinguished and prolific architect at > work in the Classical tradition in either Britain or the United States of > America. He has attempted more completely than any other architect in > Britain to pull the rug from beneath the false certainties of Modernism. > ‚Äì David Watkin Radical Classicism: The Architecture of Quinlan Terry (2006) Conversely, Terry has been the subject of considerable criticism. A 2015 article in the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) Journal quoted the late architectural historian Gavin Stamp, author of the Piloti column in the magazine Private Eye, in which Stamp derided Terry's work as \\"stiff, pedantic and uninspiring, classical details stuck on to dull boxes\\". The cultural critic Jonathan Meades, in a 2020 article in The Critic, repeated Stamp's strictures and dismissed Scruton's praise, \\"[a man] who had no eye\\", as \\"embarrassingly silly\\"; while Stephen Bayley is among those who have attacked the close relationship between Terry and the Prince of Wales. In a column in The Guardian in 2009, Bayley mocked the Prince's circle of architectural advisers as, \\"a coterie of fogeyish misfits, dreamers, forelock-tugging courtiers, DIY specialists, greasy pole-climbers [and] short-sighted antiquarians\\", reserving particular scorn for Terry, \\"a specialist in architectural pastiche [whose] modesty and art are in inverse proportion\\". Honours In 2003 Terry won the Best Modern Classical House 2003, awarded by the British Georgian Group for Ferne House in Wiltshire. In 2005 Terry won the 3rd Annual Driehaus Prize, the most prestigious award for outstanding classical and traditional architects. He holds the Philippe Rothier European Prize for the Reconstruction of the City of Archives d'Architecture Moderne (1982). He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2015 New Year Honours for services to classical architecture.

Touch rugby refers to games derived from rugby football in which players do not tackle each other but instead touch their opponents using their hands on any part of the body, clothing, or the ball. A formal, competitive variety, known as Touch, developed from rugby league and now exists as a sport in its own right. In addition, touch rugby games are played as training activities for rugby league and rugby union; as safer variants of rugby, particularly in schools and junior clubs, and as an informal social sport. Features Touch rugby has a number of differences from the traditional games, including its simplicity (it requires very little equipment or goalposts), its ease of learning, and the decreased likelihood of injury. As a result, it is a popular social game; mixed-gender and women-only games are also very popular in the UK, where Touch Rugby is played in many popular centres around England and Scotland. Touch Rugby League is a growing competition in Brisbane, Australia.http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,25316571-5014143,00.html Touch rugby is also gaining popularity in the United States. The USA Touch association hosts an annual national championship. In 2019, 27 clubs from cities across the USA registered teams into 6 competitive divisions. The sport is known as \\"Touch\\" in many parts of the world. Beach touch is also popular. Social touch games in South Africa are played barefoot, while 1-touch or six down is played with cleats that have no more than 10 studs on each foot. Since 1988, the Federation of International Touch has organized 9 World Cup championships. Typically, Australia and New Zealand have dominated as champions and runner-ups in each of the now 11 competitive divisions. Every 4 years, a member country is selected to host the tournament. In 2019, the World Cup was hosted in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and welcomed 28 participating nations. The 2023 FIT World Cup host has yet to be announced.  Rule variations  The most popular, codified form of touch rugby is derived from rugby league and features two teams of six players. Played under the auspices of the Federation of International Touch (FIT), it is officially known as Touch, and is also called touch football, particularly in Australia, and sometimes 'six down' or 'sixes' in South Africa. FIT rules have become the most common rules used both in FIT-sanctioned competitions and informal games of touch rugby. A version of the FIT rules known as one touch in South Africa features a change of possession after a single touch rather than the six in the league-derived game. League tag is a semi-contact version of rugby league. It was used initially as a coaching aid to get players new to rugby league in Ireland used to the play-the-ball, retreating to an onside line, and upperbody tackling that stops the ball being passed in the tackle. It was formally codified in 2008 at University College Cork, it allows ball carriers to hold off defenders, and defenders to grab the ball carrier in their bid to touch the ball. Touching the ball effects a tackle Other versions of touch rugby are not fully codified. For example, as an activity for fitness and skills training, and to reduce the risk of injury, rugby players will sometimes play touch rugby based on modified rugby rules. One common variation is that a fair touch must be below the waist, or, with two hands, or, to encourage rucking, a small non-contact ruck may be formed when a player is \\"touched\\". The \\"touched\\" player must fall to the ground as he would if he were tackled, and then two players from the attacking team must \\"ruck\\" over him within three seconds to keep possession of the ball. A scrum-half then recovers the ball, and play continues. Touch rugby is often played informally, rather like a pick-up soccer or basketball game. In addition to tackles being replaced by touches, the rules of both rugby codes are simplified, removing elements such as scrums, rucks, mauls, line-outs and kicks. In the United States, Touch Rugby is usually played following pre-1967 rugby league rules, minus kicking. Players being touched with two hands must place the ball down or play the ball at the spot of the \\"tackle,\\" and the defensive team must retreat 5 yards or meters. There is often no tackle count, meaning that almost the only way that the defence can obtain the ball is through offensive mistakes. Whenever an offensive infraction occurs (ball into touch, knock-on, or forward pass), the defence receives a tap-kick at the spot of the infraction. Teams switch sides after each try is scored, and the team scoring the try kicks off from the half point. Until 2003/2004 the English RFU in its junior development program called The Three Stages of the Rugby Continuum encouraged the playing of Non- contact/touch rugby in its under-eights competition, although now promotes Mini Tag instead.

After training with Mildred Burke, she wrestled in Japan under the name Monster Ripper. In 1987, she returned to Canada and began working with Stampede Wrestling, where she was their first Stampede Women's Champion. In 1995, she worked in the World Wrestling Federation as the comedic character Bertha Faye, winning the WWF Women's Championship. She also wrestled in World Championship Wrestling to help generate interest in their women's division. Professional wrestling career =Training= While growing up in Calgary, Sing attended numerous Stampede Wrestling events with her mother. She knew she wanted to be a wrestler from a young age and frequently beat up the neighborhood children. As a teenager, Sing approached members of the Hart wrestling family and asked to be trained, but she was rejected as they did not train women wrestlers at the time. Bret Hart, however, claims it had more to do with scheduling conflicts. During a trip to Hawaii in 1978, she saw Japanese women's wrestling on television and decided she wanted to pursue the sport. She later wrote to Mildred Burke, after a friend gave her a magazine with Burke's contact information, and sent her a biography and photo. Shortly thereafter, she joined Burke's training facility in Encino, California. =Japan, Canada, and Puerto Rico (1979‚Äì1995)= After a few weeks of training with Burke, Sing was scouted by All Japan Women (AJW), despite her inexperience. Sing's debut match in Japan was a tag team match with partner Mami Kumano, defeating the Beauty Pair (Jackie Sato and Maki Ueda) in January 1979. In Japan, she began wrestling under the name Monster Ripper. Although she found adjusting to the Japanese culture difficult, Sing held AJW's title on two occasions and was the first Calgary born wrestler to gain success in Japan. During her time in the company, the Japanese female wrestlers gave her a hard time because they did not like losing to foreigners. Sing also had difficulty because of her youth and inexperience in the ring. Sing, however, was comforted by New Japan Pro Wrestling's Dynamite Kid, who had also trained in Calgary. Sing won the WWWA World Single Championship from Jackie Sato on July 31, 1979. Despite losing the title to Sato six weeks later, she regained it on March 15, 1980. The title was vacated in August 1980. After another stint in Japan, Sing returned to Stampede Wrestling in late 1987 and was renamed Rhonda Singh by Bruce Hart, the owner of the company. There were plans to pair her with Gama Singh, but they never came to fruition. During 1987, she was named their first Women's Champion because she had defeated Wendi Richter prior to returning to Stampede. She held the title until September 22, 1988, when she lost to Chigusa Nagayo. Over the next few years, Sing once again traveled throughout the world and wrestled for a number of companies, holding several titles. Between 1987 and 1990, Sing worked in Puerto Rico for the World Wrestling Council (WWC), where she held the WWC Women's Championship on five separate occasions by defeating Wendi Richter, Candi Devine, and Sasha in matches for the title. . As Monster Ripper on the WWC 18th Anniversary Show (July 6, '91), she faced and beat El Profe on a woman vs man match. =World Wrestling Federation (1995‚Äì1996)= WWF as Bertha Faye In 1995, Sing was contacted by the World Wrestling Federation to help their ailing women's division. She, however, was repackaged as Bertha Faye, a comedic character who lived in a trailer park and dated Harvey Wippleman. (in an OWW radio interview Wippleman revealed that the two never got along well)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7FSa5fhNcE WWF management originally wanted her to have an on-screen feud with Bull Nakano, but there was a change of plans after Nakano was charged with cocaine possession. Sing made her WWF debut on the April 3, 1995 episode of Monday Night Raw participating in a sneak attack on Alundra Blayze, making it appear as if Blayze's nose had been broken. At SummerSlam, Faye defeated Blayze for the WWF Women's Championship and held the title until the October 23, 1995 airing of Monday Night Raw, where Blayze regained the title, ending Faye's reign at only 57 days. Fan interest in women's wrestling sunk once again as the year closed, and Sing tired of working there. Moreover, Faye was frustrated with her gimmick. WWF management asked her not to perform the same power moves as the male wrestlers, so instead, Faye was forced to act as comic relief. After a year with the company, Sing asked for a release from her contract. She briefly returned to Japan, but did not like the new system, which did not guarantee payouts. =World Championship Wrestling (1999‚Äì2000)= In late 1999, she worked with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) briefly, appearing on several telecasts to help generate interest in a women's division. She was also a contender for both the WCW Cruiserweight Championship and WCW Hardcore Championship. In addition to competing in matches using her Singh and Monster Ripper gimmicks, she also made a couple of appearances with the Nitro Girls dance troupe under the name \\"Beef\\", for comic relief. Personal life Backstage, Sing was friends with the male, rather than the female, wrestlers. During her time in the WWF, she developed a close friendship with Owen Hart. After leaving WCW, Sing took a break from wrestling. In 2001, she worked as a caregiver to the disabled. On July 27, 2001, Sing died from a heart attack at the age of 40. Bruno Lauer disputes her cause of death in an interview with Online World of Wrestling Radio where he states that, \\"she took herself out.\\" She never married or had children.

He founded Barclay Records. Life Ruault, the son of a caf√© waiter and a post office worker, was born in Paris on January 26, 1921. He spent much of his early childhood with his grandmother in Taverny (in today's Val-d'Oise). His parents bought the Caf√© de la Poste bar in the middle of Paris while he was a child and at the age of 15 he left school to work in the caf√©. He had not enjoyed his studies but he taught himself music and piano. He particularly liked American jazz and embraced the music of Fats Waller. He often visited the Hot Club de France to hear the quintet of St√©phane Grappelli and Django Reinhardt. He became a pianist at \\"L'√âtape\\" club in rue Godot-de-Mauroy, Paris, where his half-hour sets alternated with the young Louis de Fun√®s, also at the start of his career. When the German occupiers of France banned jazz, he held regular social gatherings with other zazous at his home to listen to jazz records and illegal radio stations. Pierre-Louis Gu√©rin employed him as a pianist at Gu√©rin's first nightclub, \\"Le Club\\". After the war, Eduard Ruault changed his name to Eddie Barclay and opened \\"Eddie's Club\\" in Paris. In 1947 he started a band which featured his wife, Nicole, on vocals under the name Eve Williams. Barclay and his wife started \\"Blue Star Records\\", using their apartment to store 78 rpm discs, with Barclay delivering them himself. Musicians on the label included Don Byas and Eddie Constantine. Barclay wrote songs with Charles Aznavour and Boris Vian, and with Vian he edited Jazz magazine. In 1952 Alan Morrison, a visitor to Barclay's club, had invited him to visit the US to see the new recording technology that enabled the production of 45s and LPs. In 1955 Barclay agreed to manufacture and distribute Mercury Records in Europe. He took 60 masters to Path√©-Marconi's Paris factory and began promoting the new microgroove format to the French market. As well as releasing US records by the likes of Ray Charles, Dizzy Gillespie, Sammy Davis, Jr. and Duke Ellington, Barclay engaged Gerhard Lehner, a German sound engineer, to make original recordings in Avenue Hoche, Paris. After selling 1.5 million copies of the Platters' \\"Only You\\", Barclay Records rose to become the top music production company in France. His success led to his nickname as \\"empereur du microsillon\\" (king of microgroove). His francophone discoveries included the singers Hugues Aufray, Michel Delpech, Dalida (whom he launched in 1956), Mireille Mathieu, Claude Nougaro, and Eddy Mitchell. His artistes delighted in the artistic freedom that he afforded them, and in the trust that he placed in their judgement. Aznavour joined the Barclay stable in 1956 even though they had been friends for over a decade by that time. They collaborated on some songwriting including Quand tu m'embrasses (When You Hold Me). Jacques Brel, the Belgian poet-singer who stayed with Barclay until his death in 1978, began his long association with Barclay in 1962, recording hits including \\"Le plat Pays\\" (The Flat Country), and \\"Les Bigotes\\" (The Holier-than-Thous) on the Barclay label. Brel left Philips Records to join Barclay as did Juliette Gr√©co. Philips threatened to litigate but the matter was settled out of court and Barclay released Johnny Hallyday to Philips as part of the settlement. Anarchist poet L√©o Ferr√© was another established singer-songwriter who joined Barclay Records to great mutual benefit. Barclay's nose for success was not infallible, however. He refused to sign Bob Marley, ended his collaboration with Pierre Perret and dropped Michel Sardou, four years after discovering him, by telling him \\"My little old fellow, write songs if you want, but especially do not sing them. You do not have any talent!\\" At the beginning of the eighties, recovering from cancer of the throat, which had been diagnosed in 1979, he sold 80% of his label to Polygram, and retired to Saint-Tropez, where he had spent 25 years building a house called Maison du Cap, Ramatuelle, since Brigitte Bardot persuaded him to buy land there in the late 1950s. His trademark was a white suit, and his Saint-Tropez parties at which all the guests wore white became huge events for the French media. He emerged briefly from retirement with a new record label but it was not the success he wished. The house was bought by Amanda Eliasch and Johan Eliasch and is now owned by Johan Eliasch alone. In March 1994 Barclay underwent quadruple bypass surgery after a heart attack. On April 29, 2005 he was admitted to the Ambroise-Par√© hospital in Paris with urinary and pulmonary infections. He died there during the night of May 12, 2005 and was pronounced dead in the morning. He has one son, Guillaume, from his third marriage to Marie-Christine Steinberg. Works Barclay transcribed and interpreted early jazz numbers. He co-wrote the songs Quand tu m'embrasses with Charles Aznavour, and Le rock de Monsieur Failair with Boris Vian. He wrote the original soundtracks for several films, including Bob le flambeur (1955, English title: Bob the Gambler; one translation is \\"Bob the high roller\\") directed by Jean-Pierre Melville. In 1988 he published his autobiography. Wives Barclay was notorious for his many wives to the extent that some journalists referred to him as 'Bluebeard'. At one of his later weddings, the officiating mayor of Neuilly said: \\"Ah, good day, Monsieur Barclay, what a pleasure to see you yet again.\\" His nine wives were: * Michele (2 years) married in 1945 * Nicole (14 years), jazz singer under the name of Eve Williams * Marie-Christine (4 years) * B√©atrice (1.5 years) - she subsequently married Guy Marchand * Michele (briefly) * Danielle Mauroy (1 year) * Cathy (3 years) * Caroline (11 years) married in 1988 * Tiara, married in June 2002 on the island of Moorea.

Dunnigan's ZIP code is 95937 and its area code 530. It lies at an elevation of 69 feet (21 m). History The town of Dunnigan was founded as Antelope by two early settlers, J. S. Copp and Jolin Wilson. During the year 1853 they were living down nearer the Sacramento River, but the winter flood washed them on to higher ground and they settled on new claims here. Next year, A. W. Dunnigan, a Yolo County postal worker, came and gave name to the place. With him were Henry Yarick and Abial Barker, the former going into the hotel business with Dunnigan, the inn being known as \\"Dunnigan's.\\" Other neighbors were Irving W. and William Brownell, Isaac Rice, D. T. Bird, Harry Porterfield and M. A. Rahm. The first store was opened in 1866 by G. B. Lewis, who sold out to William Earll. Z. J. Brown was the proprietor of a drug and notion store for several years, after which he was succeeded by G. W. Gray. In 1876 the railroad came along, and the town plat of Dunnigan was filed for record at the county seat November 1 of that year. A post office opened in 1856, the name was changed from Antelope to Dunnigan in 1876.

Nick McCave's research looks at perturbations in the deep oceans, using evidence from micro-fossils combined with carbon dating, to obtain information on pre-historical climate change. It is important to understand the normal cycles of climate change, in order to assess the degree to which the global warming we are experiencing now is caused by man, and the likely consequences by analysis of past analogues. One problem is the interaction between atmospheric climate change and the observed changes in the ocean currents. There is a 'chicken and egg' question: are the perturbations seen in atmospheric CO2 concentrations forced by the vigour of the deep ocean currents, or vice versa? McCave uses monitoring points in the North Atlantic Ocean, Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean to study how the Earth‚Äôs meridional heat flux is distributed by warm surface-ocean currents and cold deep-ocean currents.

Historically a part of Lancashire, it is located next to the village of Aspull. The western boundary is the River Douglas which separates the township from Wigan. To the north a small brook running into the Douglas divides it from Blackrod. At the 2001 census it had a population of 594.Census 2001 History Haigh is derived from the Old English haga, a hedge and means \\"the enclosure\\". The township was variously recorded as Hage in 1193, Hagh in 1298, and Haghe, Ha and Haw in the 16th century. =Manor= Between 1220 and 1230 the manor was part of the Marsey fee. Hugh de Haigh, probably Hugh le Norreys paid 3 marks in 1193‚Äì4 for having the king's good will. Richard de Orrell granted land in Haigh to Cockersand Abbey in 1220. In 1282 Hugh le Norreys was lord of Haigh. His daughter Mabel married William Bradshagh and in 1298 they inherited the manors of Haigh and Blackrod from Mabel's father. Bradshagh took part in Adam Banastre's rebellion in 1315 for which he was outlawed and by 1317 his manors were confiscated by the crown and granted to Peter de Limesey. William was presumed dead and Mabel remarried, but he returned in 1324 and killed Mabel's new husband. Sir William was killed at Winwick in August 1333. As penance, a legend states that Mabel walked barefoot from Wigan to Haigh every week for the rest of her life. The legend was made into a novel by Sir Walter Scott, and is remembered by Mab's Cross in Wigan Lane. In 1336 and 1337 Mabel Bradshaigh arranged for the succession of the manors to her husband's nephews; Haigh to William, son of John de Bradshagh, and Blackrod to Roger, son of Richard. In 1338 she founded a chantry in Wigan Church. She held the manor until 1346. She is honoured in the naming of Lady Mabel's Wood, a Woodland Trust wood at Haigh Hall country park. Early in 1365 Roger de Bradshagh of Westleigh claimed the manor from William de Bradshagh and Sir Henry de Trafford. Thomas de Bradshagh took part in the Rising of the North of 1403 and was present at the Battle of Shrewsbury and was later pardoned by Henry IV. Edward Bradshaigh (d. 1652), a Carmelite friar ‚Äì known as Elias √† Jesu ‚Äì was the fourth son of Roger Bradshaigh. Three brothers were Jesuits, and one brother a secular priest. Sir Roger Bradshaigh MP, was created a baronet in 1679 (see Bradshaigh baronets). Sir Roger Bradshaigh, the third Baronet, MP for Wigan for over 50 years, was Father of the House in the House of Commons from 1738 to 1747. Over time the name has been variously recorded as Bradshagh, Bradshaghe and Bradshaw. The Bradshaigh variant dates from about 1518.Haigh Country Park, visitor guide map leaflet, published by Wigan Leisure and Culture Trust. Haigh Hall On 1 June 1780 Elizabeth Dalrymple, great niece of the fourth Baronet and heiress of Haigh as a result of the failure of the male line in her maternal family (Bradshaigh), married Alexander Lindsay, 6th Earl of Balcarres. In 1787 the Earls of Crawford (after 1848, the Earls of Crawford and Balcarres) moved their seat to Haigh Hall for several generations. A manor house had stood on the Haigh estate since the Middle Ages. The present hall was built between 1827 and 1840 on the site of the ancient manor house, by Alexander's son the 7th Earl Balcarres who designed and supervised its construction whilst living in a cottage in the grounds. James, the 9th Earl, a bibliophile, established an extensive library at the hall. David, the 11th Earl sold the hall and grounds to Wigan Corporation in 1947 for ¬£18,000 and moved back to the family's original home in Balcarres. =Coal= In 1540 John Leland reported that Sir Roger Bradshaigh had discovered a seam of cannel coal on his estate which could be burnt or carved by hand or machine into ornaments. It was an excellent fuel, easily lit, burned with a bright flame and left virtually no ash. It was widely used for domestic lighting in the early 19th century before the incandescent gas mantle was available but lost favour when coal gas made it obsolete. The cannel coal was mined from Tudor times but by the mid-1600s the mines were wet and started flooding. To remedy this, between 1653 and 1670, Sir Roger Bradshaw built a sough or adit, the Great Haigh Sough which ran for about a mile under his estate. It still drains water from the ancient workings. The Bradshaws successors, the Earls of Crawford and Balcarres, founded the Wigan Coal and Iron Company in 1865. Collieries in Haigh belonging the Wigan Coal and Iron Company in 1896 were the Alexandra, Bawkhouse, Bridge, Lindsay and Meadow Pits. The central workshops for Balcarres' collieries in Haigh and Aspull were built on the north bank of the canal between 1839 and 1841. The forge, smithy, joinery and fitting shops were powered by a steam engine. The site became the sawmill for the Wigan Coal and Iron Company's pits and Kirkless Iron and Steel Works. The Georgian office block survives. =Haigh Foundry= Haigh Foundry was opened in the steep-sided Douglas valley in 1788 by the 6th earl, his brother and Mr Corbett an iron founder from Wigan. It was an iron works producing pig iron and castings. Brock Mill Forge, of even earlier origins, was acquired. From 1808, the firm manufactured winding engines and pumps for the mining industry. In 1812, it built Lancashire's first locomotive and two more by 1816. In 1835 E. Evans and T.C. Ryley took a 21-year lease. They built 0-4-0 and 2-2-0 locomotives, subcontracted from Edward Bury. In 1837, Ajax was supplied to the Leicester and Swannington Railway, followed by Hector, an 0-6-0. In 1838 two broad gauge locomotives were built for the Great Western Railway. Four saddle tank locomotives designed by Daniel Gooch were built for the South Devon Railway. Long boiler locomotives were built for Jones and Potts and three locomotives were built for T.R.Crampton. In 1855 two 0-8-0 locomotives were built for use in the Crimean War, hauling guns up inclines as steep as 1 in 10. Over 100 locomotives were built before the lease expired in 1856. In 1848, Haigh produced a beam engine of 100 inch bore by 12 feet stroke, possibly the largest in the world at that time. During the same decade, it supplied massive swing bridges for Albert Dock, Liverpool and Hull Docks - both extant in 2011. A new lease was signed by Birley & Thompson who concentrated on mining machinery, mill engines and large iron fabrications. Until 1860, castings had to be carted up the hill out of the valley and records exist of at least 48 horses being hired from farmers to move a single casting. A railway was built but was re-routed a few years later. The foundry lease was given up in 1884 and the works closed in 1885. Several of Haigh's engineers left to form engine building companies - Walker Brothers, Ince Forge and Worsley Mesnes Ironworks Ltd. Much of the site, with the exception of Brock Mill Forge, was intact in 2011 and the route of the mineral railway, including four bridges, is little changed. The foundry has been demolished but the site is used for manufacturing. The cast iron gateposts remain and a four storey building and chimney by the River Douglas. The foundry drawing office was on Wingates Road in a building with large windows and a stone floor supported by cast iron columns. Governance Lying within the historic county boundaries of Lancashire since the early 12th century, Haigh was a township in the ecclesiastical parish of Wigan in the Hundred of West Derby. It was part of the Wigan Poor Law Union which after 1837 took responsibility for the administration and funding of the Poor Law in that area. Haigh was part of the Wigan Rural Sanitary District until 1894 and Wigan Rural District from 1894 until 1974. Geography Haigh's western boundary is the River Douglas and a small brook, a tributary of the Douglas, divides it from Blackrod in the north. The township which covers 2198 acres is on ground that rises towards the east and north. The village, about 2¬Ω miles northeast of Wigan, is near the Aspull boundary at about above sea level. Haigh Hall Country Park occupies 250 acres of woods and parkland on south-western slopes. To the east are Winter Hill and the West Pennine Moors. Roads lead north to Blackrod, west to Standish, and south to Wigan and Aspull. The Lancaster Canal portion of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal crosses the western part of the township near the River Douglas. Haigh's underlying rocks are the sandstones, shales and ironstones of the Middle Coal Measures of the Lancashire Coalfield and coal and cannel were extensively mined. The Great Haigh Fault throws the Cannel and King Coal seams close to the surface at Haigh and deeper seams outcropped east of the fault within Haigh Hall Estate. The deepest seam of the Middle Coal Measures, the Arley outcrops a quarter mile north of the estate boundary, Arley Brook. Demography According to the United Kingdom Census 2001, the civil parish of Haigh had a population of 594.Neighbourhood Statistics - Haigh (CP). URL accessed 17 June 2007. Landmarks Haigh Windmill after restoration in 2011 Haigh Windmill, the only remaining windmill in Greater Manchester, was built in 1845 and supplied well water to John Sumner & Company's Haigh Brewery which, until the 1950s, was situated behind the Balcarres Arms public house. The disused windmill was restored in 2011 in a ¬£60,000 scheme made possible by Heritage Lottery Funding. The damaged brickwork was repaired and a broken and missing sail replaced. Transport Henry Eastman was the engineer for part of the Lancaster Canal to Haigh which was completed in 1799. This is the section where the canal joined the western arm of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal near Wigan Top Lock. In 1810 the Leeds and Liverpool Canal Company was allowed to use the Lancaster Canal south of Johnson's Hillock and the two joined in 1816. The canal passed through the Haigh estate and a Packet House for goods, mail and passengers was built near the Wigan Road entrance. The Springs Branch Railway which ran from Ince Moss to Haigh and Aspull opened in 1838. There was a station at Red Rock which opened in 1869 on the Lancashire Union Railway. A waiting room was maintained for the occupants of Haigh Hall from 1870 until they left in 1946. The station was closed in 1949. Religion St David's Church St David's Church is a Commissioners' church built as a chapel of ease to Wigan All Saints. The architect was Thomas Rickman and it was consecrated in 1833. In 1838 the parish of Haigh and Aspull was formed. The Roman Catholic Church of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception was founded as a mission in 1853 and the church opened in 1858.

It covers an area of along the Murray River from where it flows into South Australia from New South Wales and Victoria downstream to Blanchetown. The major town centres are Renmark, Berri, Loxton, Waikerie, Barmera and Monash, along with many minor townships; the population is approximately 35,000 people. The Riverland is located about 1.75 to 3 hours (or ) north-east of Adelaide, and 90 minutes west (or ) from Mildura, Victoria via the Sturt Highway. The Riverland has a Mediterranean climate with warm, dry summers and relatively mild winters, with temperatures a few degrees above those of Adelaide. The average summer temperature is , with a winter average of and an average rainfall of . History =Indigenous history= At the time of British colonisation of South Australia in the 1830s, and for tens of thousands of years before then, the area today known as the Riverland was inhabited by Aboriginal Australian peoples. At the time of colonisation, these were (from west to east) the Ngaiawang, Ngawait, and Erawirung, sometimes collectively referred to as the Meru people. Based on available data, the pre-European population along the Murray River within South Australia is estimated to have been several thousand people, with a density of up to 0.3 to per person.Ceremonial exchanges were major events, with people travelling from far and wide to participate. At this time, the peoples of the central River Murray area were \\"engaged in a broad- based economy embedded in a diverse and highly productive mosaic of riverine habitats\\". Archaeological finds The oldest known River Murray Indigenous site, a midden of ancient river mussel shells, confirmed the occupation of the site by Aboriginal peoples for at least 29,000 years. The find has expanded the scarce knowledge of the area's ancient history. A study reporting the find and describing the dating as \\"based on 31 radiocarbon age determinations\\" was published on 14 July 2020, saying that this pushes back the previously known occupation of the area by 22,000 years, into the last ice age. The research was carried out as part of an ongoing collaboration between the River Murray and Mallee Aboriginal Corporation (RMMAC) and researchers from Flinders University led by Amy Roberts, and is a first step in a larger project tracking hows how people lived during that time. Evidence of trade in chert and large sandstone grinding dishes had already been found, but this find helps to show how their ancestors survived times of hardship and plenty. =European settlement= The first district to be established in the region was Renmark in 1887 by the Chaffey Brothers, who also established the Mildura Irrigation District in the neighbouring upstream region of Sunraysia. Other settlements followed in the 1890s at: Holder, Kingston, Lyrup, Moorook, Murtoa, New Era, New Renmark, Pyap, Ramco and Waikerie. Some of these irrigation schemes were developed as a government response to the economic depression of the 1890s, where the aim was to keep energy, talent and capital from leaving South Australia using Village Settlement Schemes. In 1901 a Royal Commission recommended that the settlements be subdivided and leased to individual settlers instead of village associations, and over time most of these areas became government irrigation areas. Soldier settlement schemes were later allotted for returned servicemen at: Berri, Chaffey, Cadell and Cobdogla from 1917. Loxton and Cooltong were allotted from 1946 on. During World War II, the region hosted an internment camp for people of Japanese, German and Italian origin or descent. This camp was based at Loveday but little remains today to indicate its existence. In 1956 and 1961 the privately developed Sunlands/Golden Heights schemes were established. As pumping technology became more affordable and efficient, more recent development occurred through private irrigation, where irrigators operated their own pumping infrastructure pumping water from the River. Water trade enabled further growth in these properties from the early 1990s, with the Riverland purchasing water from pasture users in upstream states, or from the downstream lower Murray region, to expand the wine grape and almond industries. Some of this development was funded through managed investment schemes. Climate and economy The region enjoys a warm Mediterranean/temperate climate, with seasonal temperatures a few degrees above Adelaide‚Äôs temperatures. The average winter temperature is and the average summer temperature is , with a mean of. Average rainfall of Renmark is . The Riverland's economy is driven by primary production. The region has sustainable comparative advantages for high value irrigated horticulture, including soils, climate, reliability of water supply, best practice water supply systems, ability to grow a diversity of crops, fruit fly free status and proximity to markets. The area is Australia's largest wine-producing region, growing over half (63 per cent in 2014) of South Australia's wine grapes. In 2013 the region produced 22 per cent of Australia's wine grape crush with approximately under wine grapes, which was produced by over 1,000 growers. The Riverland is also a significant almond and stone fruit-growing region, producing 18 per cent of Australia's almonds and 7 per cent of Australia's fresh stone fruit, and Riverland juices and milk drinks are stocked on supermarket shelves across Australia and internationally. The agriculture industry is the largest employer in the area. the Central Irrigation Trust manages irrigation water for \\"1,600 growers who irrigate of horticultural crops in 12 Private Irrigation Districts\\" (Berri, Cadell, Chaffey, Cobdogla, Kingston, Loxton, Moorook, Mypolonga, Waikerie, Lyrup, Golden Heights and Sunlands). There is also the Renmark Irrigation Trust, which supplies water to 4,700 ha. All the water is supplied from the River Murray. Many of the towns were established for the re-settlement of soldiers after their return from World War I or World War II. Most towns were established as separate irrigation districts.  Transportation  The Riverland is located on the main eastern state transit link, which connects Adelaide to the eastern states. Road: The Sturt Highway, a part of the National Highway Network, is the major highway connecting the Riverland Region with interstate and overseas freight connections at Adelaide's Outer Harbor and Adelaide Airport. Main roads provide regional access between towns, as well as alternative routes to major regional areas such as Murray Bridge. Air: Renmark has a regional airport that provides services for light planes, and potential for future expansion of commuter services. Waikerie airport has a sealed runway and is an operating airfield. Recreation The region is known for its natural wonders, with the opportunity to go for guided and self-guided walks, horse-riding or bike riding (both mountain biking or cycling), canoeing or kayaking on the river and creeks. Lake Bonney provides opportunities for sailing, zorbing or windsurfing. Lake Bonney was also the site where on 23 November 1964, Donald Campbell achieved the Australian Water Speed Record of in his boat, BlueBird, although he was unable to smash the world record on that attempt. The region also has a vibrant motorsports culture with options for 4-wheel driving, trail bike or motocross riding, go-kart and speedway.  Festivals  =Renmark Rose Festival= Renmark is well known for its annual Rose Festival, a 10-day long event held in October each year, which is a major tourist attraction. The very first Rose Week was run in 1994, and was the brainchild of Eithne Sidhu, who collaborated with David Ruston, who owns Australia's largest rose garden () and houses the National Rose Collection. =Loxton Christmas Light's Festival= Starting with a single Christmas light display out on a property in Loxton North, the Loxton Christmas Lights Festival today incorporates many homes throughout the township, and attracts thousands of visitors to the region over the period from November through December each year. It began when Peter Mangelsdorf was inspired to start a small Christmas display known as Christmas Wonderland. The frontage of Peter's property is filled with a magnificent display of Christmas lights and images, ranging from Bethlehem scenes to popular characters dressed for the festive season. =Riverland Food and Wine Festival= Held in mid-October each year, the Riverland Food and Wine is the region's main food and wine event showcasing local wines, ales, ciders and spirits, along with local cuisine. Held on the banks of the Murray River, the day includes entertainment, and has become a popular event with locals and visitors alike.  Tourism  Destination Riverland is the Riverland's tourism body, with this industry worth around $148 million annually.  Governance  The region is represented at a state level in the South Australian House of Assembly by local Liberal Member for Chaffey, Tim WhetstoneTim Whetstone MP Federally, Liberal Member for Barker, Tony PasinTony Pasin MP is the region's representative in the House of Representatives. Local, Anne Ruston is a Federal Senator for South Australia.

Conservation The predominant natural environment consists of River Red Gum and Black Box forests that line the river banks and flood plains, as well as steep cliffs. The Riverland is abundant in wildlife, the more common species encountered being Pelicans, Kookaburras, Brush Tail Possums and Perons Tree Frogs. Less common species include Koalas (introduced to Renmark), Bush Stone Curlews and Carpet Pythons (rated 'vulnerable' to extinction in the region). Riverlanders share an interest in the health of the River Murray. The Riverland region lies in the southern part of the Murray Darling Basin where the broad River Murray floodplain and its river meanders for approximately through red sandy Mallee dune landscapes. Several conservation reserves protect biodiversity and provide for conservation and wise use activities. Protected area associated with the River Murray include Murray River National Park, Loch Luna Game Reserve and Moorook Game Reserve. Mallee landscape reserves include Chowilla Regional Reserve, Billiatt Conservation Park, Pooginook Conservation Park, Calperum Station and several privately owned reserves including Birds Australia's Gluepot Reserve. In the river valley, there are several hundred wetlands including two Ramsar wetlands of international importance ‚Äî Banrock Station Wetland Complex and the Riverland Wetland which encompasses Chowilla floodplain, and other wetlands including Pike River basin, Gurra Gurra wetlands and Katarapko Creek.

The pharmaceutical analogs of naturally occurring GM-CSF are called sargramostim and molgramostim. Unlike granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, which specifically promotes neutrophil proliferation and maturation, GM-CSF affects more cell types, especially macrophages and eosinophils.  Function  GM-CSF is a monomeric glycoprotein that functions as a cytokine ‚Äî it is a white blood cell growth factor. GM-CSF stimulates stem cells to produce granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils) and monocytes. Monocytes exit the circulation and migrate into tissue, whereupon they mature into macrophages and dendritic cells. Thus, it is part of the immune/inflammatory cascade, by which activation of a small number of macrophages can rapidly lead to an increase in their numbers, a process crucial for fighting infection. GM-CSF also has some effects on mature cells of the immune system. These include, for example, enhancing neutrophil migration and causing an alteration of the receptors expressed on the cells surface. GM-CSF signals via signal transducer and activator of transcription, STAT5. In macrophages, it has also been shown to signal via STAT3. The cytokine activates macrophages to inhibit fungal survival. It induces deprivation in intracellular free zinc and increases production of reactive oxygen species that culminate in fungal zinc starvation and toxicity. Thus, GM-CSF facilitates development of the immune system and promotes defense against infections. GM-CSF also plays a role in embryonic development by functioning as an embryokine produced by reproductive tract.  Genetics  The human gene has been localized in close proximity to the interleukin 3 gene within a T helper type 2-associated cytokine gene cluster at chromosome region 5q31, which is known to be associated with interstitial deletions in the 5q- syndrome and acute myelogenous leukemia. GM-CSF and IL-3 are separated by an insulator element and thus independently regulated. Other genes in the cluster include those encoding interleukins 4, 5, and 13.  Glycosylation  Human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor is glycosylated in its mature form.  History  GM-CSF was first cloned in 1985, and soon afterwards three potential drug products were being made using recombinant DNA technology: molgramostim was made in Escherichia coli and is not glycosylated, sargramostim was made in yeast, has a leucine instead of proline at position 23 and is somewhat glycosylated, and regramostim was made in Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) and has more glycosylation than sargramostim. The amount of glycosylation affects how the body interacts with the drug and how the drug interacts with the body. At that time, Genetics Institute, Inc. was working on molgramostim, Immunex was working on sargramostim (Leukine), and Sandoz was working on regramostim. Molgramostim was eventually co-developed and co- marketed by Novartis and Schering-Plough under the trade name Leucomax for use in helping white blood cell levels recover following chemotherapy, and in 2002 Novartis sold its rights to Schering-Plough. Sargramostim was approved by the US FDA in 1991 to accelerate white blood cell recovery following autologous bone marrow transplantation under the trade name Leukine, and passed through several hands, ending up with Genzyme which subsequently was acquired by Sanofi. Leukine is now owned by Partner Therapeutics (PTx). Imlygic was approved by the US FDA in October 2015, and in December 2015 by the EMA, as an oncolytic virotherapy, commercialized by Amgen Inc. This oncolytic herpes virus, named Talimogene laherparepvec, has been genetically engineered to express human GM-CSF using the tumor cells machinery. Research directions GM-CSF is found in high levels in joints with rheumatoid arthritis and blocking GM-CSF as a biological target may reduce the inflammation or damage. Some drugs (e.g. otilimab) are being developed to block GM-CSF. In critically ill patients GM-CSF has been trialled as a therapy for the immunosuppression of critical illness, and has shown promise restoring monocyte and neutrophil function, although the impact on patient outcomes is currently unclear and awaits larger studies.

In North America, the company sells coffee directly to consumers via home delivery and through big box stores such as Wal-Mart. Gevalia discontinued sales of tea in 2015. Customers order from a customer service center and a website that was relaunched in August 2009. In North America, Gevalia is a wholly owned subsidiary of Kraft Heinz based in Chicago, Illinois. Gevalia produces more than 40 different varieties of coffee and tea. Gevalia history Located in G√§vle, Sweden (Gevalia in Latin), Gevalia was introduced in 1853 in Sweden by the trading company Victor Theodore Engwall & Co KB. Jacob Engwall was CEO from 1963 to 1972. After 120 years as a family company, it was sold in 1971 to Mondelƒìz International predecessor company, General Foods. Most Gevalia coffee is sold in Sweden, Denmark and in the Baltic area, but some is exported to America. Gevalia owes a large part of its current success in Northern Europe to a well-known and long-running marketing campaign with the theme of \\"unexpected visitors\\", starting in the early 1990s. The campaign featured in addition to print ads and movie commercials also installations in public places in Sweden featuring submarines and airplanes. Gevalia began North American sales, via mail-order delivery service, in 1983. Gevalia is perhaps most well known for its introductory offer of a free coffeemaker and other coffee-related incentives. These offers were seen in magazine advertisements, direct mailings, and television commercials, but were later overtaken by online advertising. Some of these Gevalia.com advertisements were the basis of the 2005 Hypertouch based lawsuit. In September 2013, Gevalia Introduced specialty drink K-Cups using real milk. In 2011, Kraft announced the retail launch of Gevalia in the United States; the in-store collection started with a complete line of ground, whole bean, decaf and flavored options. A mainstream supermarket brand in Northern Europe, Gevalia is marketed in the United States as a premium brand. Gevalia holds the royal warrant of appointment for coffee roasters from the King of Sweden. Gevalia also maintains an Office Coffee Service, offering mail-order coffee by the case, as well as coffee singles. Gevalia is also sold for the Tassimo and K-Cup systems in the United States. Coffees and teas As of February 2007, Gevalia offered more than 40 different coffees and teas, according to Gevalia.com. The majority of these coffees are Arabica blends, using beans from Kenya, Guatemala, Colombia, and Costa Rica. Gevalia Kaffe is composed of up to six different varieties of these Arabica beans, as well as Brazilian beans.  Controversies  In 2005, Kraft was sued by Hypertouch, an ISP, for spamming its Gevalia coffee brand. Kraft was accused of sending multiple waves of junk advertisement to the ISP's customers, the action brought under the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 act.

Worthington Company, a wholesale hardware and industrial distribution firm, in 1829 (until 1991 Cleveland's oldest extant business), as well as numerous banking and mining concerns, and contributed to the early commercial and industrial development of Cleveland. Early life and family George Worthington was born in Cooperstown, New York, to Clarissa (n√©e Clarke) and Ralph Worthington, a banker and manufacturer, who had moved to Cooperstown from his birthplace of Colchester, Connecticut, at a young age. Worthington was also second cousins with the American engineer Henry Rossiter Worthington of New York. On November 16, 1840, Worthington married Maria Cushman Blackmar, and soon after, moved into his newly constructed home on Euclid Avenue, the street which would, in the second half of the 19th century, come to be known as Millionaire's Row. Maria C. Worthington had eight children; five girls and three boys, one of each dying in infancy, leaving his two sons, Ralph and his younger brother, George Jr., to inherit their father's business interests upon his death in 1871. Business George's first store occupied the ground on which now stands the Bethel Building. Afterwards, he purchased the stock of Cleveland, Sterling & Co., on the corner of Water and Superior streets, where the National Bank buildings now stand, and associated with himself as business partner of Mr. William Bingham. In 1841, Mr. Bingham sold out his interest. A few years later, Mr. Worthington associated himself with his cousin Mr. James Barnett and Mr. Edward Bingham. In around 1862, Mr. Worthington projected the Cleveland Iron and Nail Works in connection with Mr. William Bingham. Shortly afterwards, they built works for the manufacturing of a gas pipe. On the passage of the National Bank Law, Mr. Worthington, with other capitalists, organized the First National Bank of Cleveland. The bank was incorporated in 1863, and at the first meeting of the stockholders, held in June of that year, he was chosen as one of the directors and elected president of the bank. In 1865, Worthington was among the Cleveland businessmen who organized the Hahnemann Life Insurance Company (named for German physician Samuel Hahnemann), the first such firm in the U.S. to offer to insure those whose medical belief and practice were exclusively homeopathic, at lower rates than those subjecting themselves to traditional medical treatment; as some contemporary evidence showed a lower rate of mortality under the former. Worthington was also a director of the Ohio Savings and Loan Bank, for some years a director of the Cleveland, Columbus, Cincinnati & Indianapolis Railway Company, and was president of the Cleveland Iron Mining Company. He was also one of the pioneers in the development of the iron interests of Cleveland. Architecture and development The George Worthington Co. constantly required relocation to larger facilities. In 1882, the hardware-wholesale- turned industrial supply company moved into its last building on 820 St. Clair Avenue. Designed by the Cleveland architectural firm of Cuddell and Richardson, The George Worthington Building is noted as a \\"highly decorative brick structure, notable for its unusually wide window bays grouped in two multi-story arched ranks, a brick cornice, recessed spandrels and finials.\\" Having fallen into disrepair in the later half of the 20th century, the George Worthington Building was rehabilitated as modern loft apartments in 1996 on what is today Worthington Square, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as well as being a Cleveland landmark. Worthington also did much in the way of building up the city, especially in the business portions, and owned at one point 14 buildings in what is today the Historic Warehouse District. George Worthington is interred in the Worthington Mausoleum at the Lakeview Cemetery in Cleveland.

Otani is also the acting President of the company. Professional wrestling career =New Japan Pro Wrestling (1992‚Äì2001)= Idolizing Kengo Kimura as a little child, and after graduating from high school, Otani moved out from his parents house after being heavily criticized by them for choosing a professional wrestling career, he left with 60.000 yen in his pocket. He went to Tokyo to start training in Animal Hamaguchi's gym. Otani's life was hard at the beginning, since he was homeless and his money only paid for a small tatami-like dwelling for 24,000 yen. However, thanks to Hamaguchi, Otani found himself working in a liquor store, where he gained a lot of money that paid his debts, and got him a better place to live, and at the same time he was training for his upcoming debut. He debuted on June 25, 1992 against Hiroyoshi Yamamoto. Like every young lion, he lost almost all of his matches, picking up victories over fellow young lions, such as future tag team partner Tatsuhito Takaiwa, Tokimitsu Ishizawa and Yuji Nagata. By 1995, he was already in the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship picture, and also aiding New Japan against UWF-i alongside Nagata, Ishizawa, Takaiwa, Koji Kanemoto, Black Cat and Takashi Iizuka. A little bit later, Otani became the first WCW World Cruiserweight Champion, defeating Wild Pegasus in a tournament final to be crowned champion on March 20, 1996. This was the start of his push as a legitimate junior heavyweight contender. Over the years, Otani earned the J-Crown and was also part of the first IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Champions with Tatsuhito Takaiwa in 1999, having legendary feuds with Jyushin Thunder Liger, El Samurai, his own partner Kanemoto, Minoru Tanaka and many others. Also around that time, he started associating himself with Shinya Hashimoto, his future business partner. In 2000, New Japan booker Riki Choshu, eager to push his prot√©g√© Kensuke Sasaki above everyone else, downgraded the junior heavyweight members to mere jobbers for the heavyweights. Otani protested and was sent abroad to bulk up. Returning in 2001 as a full-fledged heavyweight, Otani challenged Sasaki for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship, but failed. =Pro Wrestling Zero-One/Zero-1 Max/Zero1 (2001‚Äìpresent)= He then joined Shinya Hashimoto in creating their own promotion, Pro Wrestling Zero1, where he became one of the top stars after Hashimoto's departure in 2004 and subsequent death. During the company's relaunch following Hashimoto's death it was renamed to Pro Wrestling ZERO1-MAX. In ZERO1 he formed a tag team with Masato Tanaka called Emblem; Team Emblem (as they were later known) would appear in the US promotion Ultimate Pro Wrestling, and include Keiji Sakoda. This tag team has formed, disbanded, and reformed numerous times during Otani's time in ZERO1. EMBLEM would go on to win the NWA Intercontinental Tag Team Championship (ZERO1's top Tag Team Title Belt) two times. (Otani has held that title 4 times) Otani has won ZERO1's annual round-robin tournament the Fire Festival three separate times (2001, 2002, 2005). On January 22, 2006, Otani defeated Steve Corino for the AWA Superstars of Wrestling World Heavyweight Championship. On December 24, 2007 it was announced by ZERO1's parent company FIRST ON STAGE that Otani would become the President of ZERO1. Otani took office officially on January 23, 2007, replacing previous President Yoshiyuki Nakamura who became Director of FIRST ON STAGE. He defeated Yuji Nagata on February 27, 2009, to win the World Heavyweight Championship. On January 4, 2013, at Wrestle Kingdom 7 in Tokyo Dome, Otani made a special return to New Japan, when he replaced an injured Daichi Hashimoto in a tag team match, where he and Keiji Mutoh were defeated by Hiroyoshi Tenzan and Satoshi Kojima. Beginning in September 2015, Otani downgraded himself back to the junior heavyweight division, proclaiming that the division had \\"lost its way\\" and \\"needed more heart\\". On September 23, he reformed his junior heavyweight team with Tatsuhito Takaiwa and defeated NWA International Lightweight Tag Team Champions Takuya Sugawara and Brother Yasshi to win the titles, the team's fourth tag team title overall and their first in 15 years. On October 11 Otani defeated Minoru Tanaka (who had defeated him and Takaiwa in 2000, along with Koji Kanemoto, to end their second IWGP junior tag reign) to win both the Zero1 International and NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championships.

In many situations, the electron density of a plasma is assumed to behave according to the Boltzmann relation, due to their small mass and high mobility. Equation If the local electrostatic potentials at two nearby locations are œÜ1 and œÜ2, the Boltzmann relation for the electrons takes the form: :n_e (\\\\phi_2) = n_e(\\\\phi_1) e^{e (\\\\phi_2-\\\\phi_1)/k_B T_e} where ne is the electron number density, Te is the temperature of the plasma, and kB is the Boltzmann constant. Derivation A simple derivation of the Boltzmann relation for the electrons can be obtained using the momentum fluid equation of the two-fluid model of plasma physics in absence of a magnetic field. When the electrons reach dynamic equilibrium, the inertial and the collisional terms of the momentum equations are zero, and the only terms left in the equation are the pressure and electric terms. For an isothermal fluid, the pressure force takes the form :F_{\\\\rm fluid}=-k_BT_e abla n_e, while the electric term is :F_{\\\\rm electric}=e n_e abla\\\\phi . Integration leads to the expression given above. In many problems of plasma physics, it is not useful to calculate the electric potential on the basis of the Poisson equation because the electron and ion densities are not known a priori, and if they were, because of quasineutrality the net charge density is the small difference of two large quantities, the electron and ion charge densities. If the electron density is known and the assumptions hold sufficiently well, the electric potential can be calculated simply from the Boltzmann relation. Inaccurate situations Discrepancies with the Boltzmann relation can occur, for example, when oscillations occur so fast that the electrons cannot find a new equilibrium (see e.g. plasma oscillations) or when the electrons are prevented from moving by a magnetic field (see e.g. lower hybrid oscillations).

Based on the 1898 novella The Turn of the Screw by the American novelist Henry James, the screenplay was adapted by William Archibald and Truman Capote, who used Archibald's own 1950 stage play‚Äîalso titled The Innocents‚Äîas a primary source text. Its plot follows a governess who watches over two children and comes to fear that their large estate is haunted by ghosts and that the children are being possessed. Archibald's original screenplay for The Innocents was based on the premise that the paranormal events depicted were legitimate. Displeased with Archibald's take on the material, director Jack Clayton appointed American writer Truman Capote to rework the script. Capote's rewrites incorporated psychological themes, resulting in a final work that suggests other alternatives to the plot. Filming took place partly on location at the Gothic mansion of Sheffield Park in Sussex, with additional shoots occurring at Shepperton Studios in Surrey. Shot in CinemaScope, The Innocents incorporated bold minimal lighting as well as deep focus, employed by cinematographer Freddie Francis to achieve a distinctive‚Äîand sometimes claustrophobic‚Äîatmosphere. The film also pioneered the use of synthesised electronic sound created by Daphne Oram. Clayton was dissatisfied with the original score of the movie by French composer Georges Auric and requested some alteration. But because Auric was not available due to health problems, Clayton turned to W. Lambert Williamson. The Innocents received international distribution from the American film studio 20th Century Fox, and received its London premiere on 24 November 1961. It was released in the United States the following month on 15 December in Los Angeles and Christmas Day in New York City. The psychological underpinnings of the film's screenplay have resulted in it being the subject of numerous critical and scholarly essays, particularly in the area of film theory. Of the various film adaptations of James's work, The Innocents has received the most critical debate. It was selected by The Guardian as one of the 25 best horror films ever made.  Plot  Miss Giddens applies for her first job as a governess. The wealthy bachelor interviewing her is unconcerned with her lack of experience. He values his freedom to travel and socialise and unabashedly confesses that he has \\"no room, mentally or emotionally\\" for his niece and nephew. They were orphaned and left in his care as infants, and he keeps them at Bly, his large country estate. The previous governess, Mary Jessel, died suddenly less than a year ago. All he cares about is that Miss Giddens accept full responsibility for the children, never troubling him with whatever problems may arise. At Bly, Miss Giddens is instantly taken with Flora, the niece. She also forges a friendship with Mrs. Grose, the kindly housekeeper. The boy, Miles, is away at boarding school, but soon returns to Bly after being expelled from school for being a \\"bad influence\\" on his peers. Mrs. Grose says she cannot imagine Miles misbehaving, and when Miss Giddens meets the boy herself, she too thinks his teachers must have exaggerated. He seems charming and mature ‚Äì though perhaps too mature, with flirtatious flattery toward his governess. Miss Giddens soon grows disturbed by the children's occasional odd behaviours and secretiveness, and is bothered by disembodied voices and apparitions of a man and woman she witnesses in the house, whom Mrs. Grose identifies, from their descriptions, as Miss Jessel and Peter Quint, another deceased employee of the children's uncle. Mrs. Grose also reluctantly reveals that the two were in a relationship prior to their deaths. Miss Giddens concludes that the ghosts of Quint and Miss Jessel possess the bodies of the children so they can physically continue their relationship. She is determined to rescue them from this possession. One night, while left alone with Miles, Miss Giddens presses him to talk about the ghosts, and about why he was expelled from school. Initially, Miles is glib and evasive, but he eventually admits that he frightened the other boys with violence and vulgar language. Miss Giddens enjoins him to say who taught him this language and behaviour. Miles suddenly begins yelling obscene insults and laughing maniacally, and Quint's face appears in the window behind him, joining in the boy's laughter. Miles then runs outside; Miss Giddens follows, begging him to \\"say his name.\\" Quint appears on a hedge nearby, but Miles does not appear to see him. He finally shouts Quint's name, and Quint appears. Miles grows still and falls to the ground. Miss Giddens cradles him and assures him that he is free. She then realises that Miles is dead. Sobbing, she leans over him and kisses him on the lips.  Cast  * Deborah Kerr as Miss Giddens * Michael Redgrave as The Uncle * Peter Wyngarde as Peter Quint * Megs Jenkins as Mrs. Grose * Martin Stephens as Miles * Pamela Franklin as Flora * Clytie Jessop as Miss Mary Jessel * Isla Cameron as Anna Critical analysis The Innocents has received attention from academics and specialists in film theory, beginning with the literary theorist Edmund Wilson, who wrote extensively on the film's source novella, insisting that the supernatural phenomena were in fact the product of Miss Giddens' own sexual repression. According to literary scholar Leonard Orr, of the many adaptations of James's work, The Innocents has received the largest amount of critical attention. Film scholar David J. Hogan reiterated the film's underlying themes of sexual repression becoming the focus of supernatural activity, and compared elements of the film to Robert Wise's The Haunting (1963), based on The Haunting of Hill House by Shirley Jackson. Hogan also interprets the film's final scene as \\"a perverse variation on the Sleeping Beauty story, as Kerr symbolically liberates the boy from a presumed possession with a kiss after he has fainted.\\" In the book Fifty Classic British Films, 1932-1982: A Pictorial Record (2013), film writer Anthony Slide noted: \\"Through the use of shadows, oblique camera angles, and an atmospheric soundtrack, Jack Clayton not only captured the horror of James's story, but also its deeper sadness‚Äîthe children's isolation from the real world, the governess' problematic sexuality, and the curiously pitiful nature of the former governess, Miss Jessel.\\" Production =Conception= The original screenplay for The Innocents was adapted by playwright William Archibald from his 1950 play of the same name, which itself was based on Henry James's novella The Turn of the Screw. In both his stage and screen adaptations, Archibald wrote under the assumption that the supernatural experiences of Miss Giddens were real, and that the ghosts she encountered were legitimate entities as opposed to figments of her imagination (a possibility left unresolved in James's original work). Archibald's interpretation of the source material was made clear in a denouement in the original draft of the script, which: A key point of dispute between Clayton and screenwriter William Archibald was whether the children (pictured) were conduits for malicious spirits, or the phenomena was the invention of the protagonist's mind Director Jack Clayton envisioned a more ambiguous conclusion for the film: \\"My original interest in the story was in the fact that one could tell it from a completely different point of view,\\" he said. \\"In other words‚Äìevil was alive in the mind of the governess and in fact she more or less creates the situation. Now this was long before I read the notes on Henry James and found that somebody else also imagines that Henry James wrote it this way‚Äîsort of almost Freudian hallucinations the governess had.\\" Clayton was ultimately unhappy with Archibald's screenplay due to their conflicting interpretations of the material, and asked American writer Truman Capote (whom he had met while working on Beat the Devil) to rework Archibald's script. At the time, Capote was in the middle of writing In Cold Blood; however, because he was a fan of the James novella, he agreed, and took a three-week hiatus to rewrite the screenplay. Capote introduced the Freudian symbolism that is prominently highlighted in the relationships and visual compositions of the film, with implications that the supernatural phenomena experienced by Miss Giddens is a result of her own sexual repression and paranoias rather than legitimate paranormal experiences. Clayton later brought in writer John Mortimer to give the dialogue a \\"Victorian\\" polish. Clayton intended to maintain a sense of claustrophobia and, at the same time, open up the play, which took place entirely in the drawing room of the house. Clayton saw the house as one of the characters in the film and used it as such to highlight certain scenes. Cultural critic Christopher Frayling attributes approximately 90% of the film's script as it appears on the screen to Capote (The final credits attribute the screenplay to Archibald and Capote, with Mortimer receiving credit for \\"Additional Scenes and Dialogue\\"). Frayling also notes a Southern Gothic feel present in Capote's script alterations ‚Äì particularly with the governess's repressed erotic sensibility counterpointed by shots of lush and decaying plants and rapacious insect life. Director Clayton, though, chose to downplay this aspect in the finished film, to preserve the ambiguity between the ghost story and Freudian element. An unreliable narrator was originally intended to feature in the narrative and the film was to open with a funeral scene. There are stills of the scene that circulated at the time, but Clayton ultimately elected to open the film with darkness, a song sung by a little girl, and the image of Kerr's hands that are clasped in prayer, with her rosary between her fingers, as she murmurs and sobs. Gradually Kerr's face is highlighted. According to film scholar Frayling, the opening scene creates a sense of intimacy and, perhaps, trust that the governess should be trusted, but the use of darkness surrounding her suggests that it is possible that the story that follows could be nothing more than in her own mind ‚Äì isolated and creating its own supernatural world. =Casting= Deborah Kerr was cast in the lead role of Miss Giddens at the counsel of the film's studio and distributor, 20th Century Fox, despite the fact that the governess character in James's original work was twenty years old (Kerr was forty at the time). On discussing the part with Clayton, Kerr recalled: \\"I remember asking Jack what he wanted me to stress in playing the part, and he replied, \\"You play it the way you feel, but don't forget the ambiguity!\\" So I tried the very nervous tight-rope between sanity and insanity, and left the audience to exercise its intelligence.\\" Kerr's role in the film is significant, as she appears onscreen in approximately 95 minutes of the film's 99 minute runtime. She was paid US$400,000 for her work in the film. For the roles of the children, Clayton cast eleven-year-old Pamela Franklin (in her film debut) as Flora, and Martin Stephens as her brother, Miles; Stephens had featured in the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer horror film Village of the Damned (1960). Australian-born actress Clytie Jessop was cast as the spectral Miss Jessel (also in her film debut), while Peter Wyngarde was cast in the role of Quint, Miss Jessel's illicit lover. Though he receives top billing, Michael Redgrave appears only in the beginning of the film in a cameo role as the children's uncle. On September 19, 2013, Wyngarde and Jessop were interviewed by Matthew Sweet for a special episode of Night Waves dedicated to the film as part of the BBC Radio 3 programme Sound of Cinema. This episode also featured behind-the-scenes anecdotes provided by Susie Orbach, Christopher Frayling and Jeremy Dyson. During the interview, Wyngarde revealed that Alec Guinness and Cary Grant had expressed a strong interest in playing the role of Peter Quint. Jack Clayton turned them down. Radio programme =Filming= Cinematographer Freddie Francis painted the edges of the lenses for interior night scenes to allow for a more closed-in, claustrophobic sensibility Clayton wanted the film to be quite different from the Hammer horror films of the period, and employed a number of cinematic devices to achieve this end, including using genuinely eerie sound effects and moody, stylised lighting. For the first 45 seconds of the film, the screen is black and singing is heard, and only after this do the credits appear. Clayton, who had previously made films associated with the British New Wave, took on the project specifically to avoid being typecast as a New Wave director, and to work in a different genre. Filming of The Innocents took place primarily at Shepperton Studios in Surrey. Interior sequences were shot on sound stages at Shepperton, as well as the sequences which took place in the greenhouse veranda; a fa√ßade for Bly house was also built by the art department on the studio lot. On-location exterior scenes were shot at the Gothic mansion of Sheffield Park in East Sussex. To ensure that his child actors' performances remained uninhibited, Clayton withheld the full details of the story from Martin Stephens and Pamela Franklin, who only received those parts of the script that lacked the surprising and mysterious adult elements of the film. According to script supervisor Pamela Mann, star Deborah Kerr was specifically attuned to making sure the children \\"had fun on set\\". Writer Truman Capote was present during the first several weeks of filming, writing additional dialogue for Stephens and Franklin, and making minor script alterations. 20th Century Fox insisted that The Innocents be shot in CinemaScope, while Clayton wanted to shoot it in standard academy ratio, feeling that he would be unable to make use of the additional space on both sides of the frame. Cinematographer Freddie Francis insisted that he could work with the CinemaScope aspect ratio, having shot Sons and Lovers (1960) for director Jack Cardiff in the format. Francis won the Oscar for Best Cinematographer for his work on the earlier film. He used colour filters and used the lighting rig to create darkness consuming everything at the edge of the frame. As the shoot progressed, Clayton found uses for the edges of the screen and began composing for the CinemaScope format. Francis used deep focus and narrowly aimed the lighting towards the centre of the screen. It was so bright on set in that area that actress Kerr arrived to the set wearing sunglasses one day. Francis and Clayton framed the film in an unusually bold style, with characters prominent at the edge of the frame and their faces at the centre in profile in some sequences, which, again, created both a sense of intimacy and unease, based on the lack of balance in the image. For many of the interior night scenes, Francis painted the sides of the lenses with black paint to allow for a more intense, \\"elegiac\\" focus, and used candles custom-made with four to five wicks twined together to produce more light. During principal photography, Clayton and editor Jim Clark‚Äîwhom he had hired on the recommendation of his colleague Jimmy Ware, editor of Clayton's first feature, Room At The Top‚Äîwould meet each evening and view the footage shot that day, assembling daily rough cuts as they progressed; this allowed Clayton to make adjustments and shoot pick-ups along the way, giving him closer supervision during the filming process. =Post-production= Editing cross dissolves in post-production, merging as many as four images in a single frame In his 2010 memoir Dream Repairman, Jim Clark recalled his work as editor on The Innocents as \\"a true collaboration\\" and that he and Clayton became close friends and regular drinking partners during production, since both were single at the time, and lived near each other. He described The Innocents as \\"a real pleasure to edit, since Jack had a very certain approach to his material, having worked out everything beforehand. He was a perfectionist who left nothing to chance, and was very precise in his approach to work.\\" Inspired by George Stevens' A Place in the Sun, Clark crafted numerous dissolves and superimpositions, which he also described as \\"mini montages\\", in which he edited the cross-fades between certain scenes to run four or five times longer than the standard \\"mix\\", and often blended in a third, near-subliminal image; film scholar Anthony Slide would later refer to the film's use of dissolves as \\"obsessive\\". Clark achieved this process by using blank film rolls as a template on which he would manually assign Clayton's film negatives with hand-marked reel numbers, slate numbers, and time stamps indicating the duration each image should remain within a single frame. Clayton explained in later interviews that he felt the dissolves entirely appropriate and in accordance with his vision of the film as \\"mood-oriented\\", adding: \\"It gave me opportunities to explore this field, which I had never done before: to create in those multiple dissolves images which hang there, and have a meaning which applies both to the end of the last scene and the beginning of the next.\\" Clayton maintained close supervision over the editing of the film, specifically making sure that no single scene ran too long; because of the film's small cast, Clayton worried that \\"if [the film] sags, we've got no other characters to go to\\". According to Clark, Clayton went through \\"a lot of anguish\\" over the final scene, in which Miles dies in Miss Giddens' arms, and that the director was \\"quite prone to agonizing over scenes if he was uncertain of them, and we would run them over and over again, hardly changing a frame, until he felt reconciled to the sequence.\\" Clayton felt the climactic scene should be \\"claustrophobic and played very close‚Äîdeveloping into violence and savagery\\". Clark also revealed that, despite their previously harmonious working relationship, he unexpectedly fell out with Clayton just before the film was released, and felt that he had allowed himself to become too close to his director. Clark recalled that on the evening of the pre-release critics' screening, Clayton went into a rage because, through no fault of her own, his personal assistant Jeanie Sims was late in phoning him with the critics' reactions. When Sims called Clark to Clayton's office the next day, he discovered that Clayton had completely smashed a large plaster scale model of Bly House, and was refusing to speak to either of them. In spite of this rift, Clark and Clayton gradually repaired their friendship, and Clayton subsequently invited Clark to edit his next film, The Pumpkin Eater. Score and sound design The original score for The Innocents was composed by Georges Auric, who had scored several films Clayton had been involved with in the past, such as Moulin Rouge (1952) and The Bespoke Overcoat (1956). Clayton was dissatisfied with Auric's final score for The Innocents, and requested he make alterations; however, Auric was unable to do so because of his ailing health, and re-orchestration was completed by W. Lambert Williamson. The film also pioneered the use of synthesised electronic sounds created by Daphne Oram. These \\"spectral massed sine tones\\" were incorporated into the film's sound design, though Oram was not credited for them. \\"O Willow Waly\\" ‚Äì the song from the film by Auric and Paul Dehn; sung on the soundtrack by Isla Cameron ‚Äì was released in the United Kingdom on a Decca single in March 1962. It was covered by The Kingston Trio on their 1962 album Something Special. Release =Box office= In the United Kingdom, the original classification in 1961 given by the British Board of Film Censors (now the British Board of Film Classification or BBFC) had been the \\"X\\" rating, which meant that no person under the age of 16 years would be allowed into the cinema to see it. The Innocents had its world premiere at the Carlton Theatre in London on 24 November 1961. In North America, 20th Century Fox devised a marketing campaign that branded the film a \\"strange new experience in shock\\". The film premiered in the United States at the El Rey Theatre in Los Angeles, California on 15 December 1961, and opened in New York City on 25 December 1961, screening at the Criterion Theatre and 72nd Street Playhouse. The film grossed a total of $1.2 million in the North American territories of the United States and Canada. =Critical response= Bosley Crowther wrote an unfavourable review of the film in The New York Times when the film was first shown in New York City in December 1961: \\"But we fear that old hands long familiar with the traffic and tricks of horror films will feel a bit bored by this screen version of Henry James' famous tale, The Turn of the Screw, so mild and ingenuous it is alongside others of the genre. And especially do we fear they will be let down by the lucent performance of Deborah Kerr as the supposedly morbid young woman who is the focal figure in the tale\\". A review published in Time magazine praised Kerr's performance and the film's \\"dangerous, intelligent darkness\\", but criticized the screenplay, suggesting that Archibald and Capote's script \\"unhappily press[es] hard, much harder than James did, for the psychiatric interpretation. They have obviously failed to perceive that in suggesting a normal, everyday basis for supernatural phenomena, they must inevitably relieve the spectator of his nameless horror of what might happen. But isn't horror, when all's said and done, the one important experience this tale is intended to communicate?\\" In a Variety review, the film was deemed a \\"high-quality spine-chilling drama\\". In the summer 1962 issue of Film Quarterly, Pauline Kael called the film \\"the best ghost movie I have ever seen\\", praising Stephens' performance as well as Capote's adaptation of the source material. Boyd Martin of The Courier-Journal praised the film as a \\"spooky chiller... the hypnotic influence is there, and audiences will, I suspect, feel what the governess feels.\\" The film was nominated for two BAFTA Awards, including Best British Film and Best Film. For his direction, Clayton was awarded the National Board of Review Award for Best Director. William Archibald and Truman Capote won a 1962 Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America for Best Motion Picture Screenplay. The film was entered into the 1962 Cannes Film Festival. =Home media= The Innocents received distribution on DVD in the United States through 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment on September 6, 2005. This release also features a Spanish language mono track and the film in both widescreen and fullscreen versions. The Criterion Collection released a new edition of the film on DVD and Blu-ray on September 23, 2014. This release features a new 4K transfer, an introduction and audio commentary with cultural critic Christopher Frayling, an interview with cinematographer John Bailey (discussing the work of Freddie Francis), and a 2006 documentary on the making of the film hosted by Frayling. In the United Kingdom, the film received a Blu-ray release on 23 August 2010 through BFI. Applications for certification since 2000 have led to the film being rated as a \\"12\\" or \\"12A\\". Legacy The Innocents is regarded as a classic psychological horror film. With the British cinematic re-release of The Innocents as part of the BFI's Gothic Season in December 2013, the film has received overwhelmingly positive reviews from contemporary critics. The Innocents holds a 94% \\"fresh\\" rating on the internet review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes from a sample of 50 reviews. Its consensus reads, \\"Creepily atmospheric, The Innocents is a stylishly crafted, chilling British ghost tale with Deborah Kerr at her finest\\". Peter Bradshaw, film critic for The Guardian, gave the film five out of five stars in December 2013, praising it as an \\"elegant, sinister and scalp-prickling ghost story\\". Tim Robey, writing for The Telegraph, also gave the film five out of five stars, recognising the \\"immaculate\\" directorial ability of Jack Clayton, and commending the \\"eerie, coldly beautiful\\" adaptation of James' novel. Author and film critic Leonard Maltin in 2009 awarded the film three and a half out of a possible four stars, calling it a \\"first-rate thriller\\". Director Martin Scorsese placed The Innocents on his list of the 11 scariest horror films of all time. Similarly, Andrew Pulver placed the film at number 11 in The Guardian's list of the best horror films of all time. Time Out named it as the 18th in a list of the 100 greatest British films. \\"The Infant Kiss\\", a song by Kate Bush, from her 1980 album Never for Ever, was inspired by the film. Mexican director Guillermo del Toro cites the film as an influence on his 2015 gothic horror film Crimson Peak. On January 4, 2017, Martin Stephens gave an extensive interview on his career as a child actor during a TEDx episode titled \\"Movies, Marriage and Meditation\\".

Time-bound measures Time-bound measures to address this issue will attempt to: *Prevent the engagement of children in the worst forms of child labour. *Provide direct assistance for the removal of children from the worst forms of child labour and for their rehabilitation and social integration. *Ensure access to free basic education and appropriate vocational training for all children removed from the worst forms of child labour. *Identify and reach out to children at special risk, and *Take account of the special situation of girls. Time- bound programmes The Time-Bound Programme (TBP) approach constitutes one of the means put in place by the International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC) to assist countries in fulfilling their obligations under the convention. TBPs are designed as a comprehensive framework that governments can use to chart a course of action with well-defined targets. They comprise a set of integrated and coordinated policies and interventions with concise goals, specific targets and a defined time frame, aimed at preventing and eliminating a country‚Äôs WFCL. They emphasize the need to address the root causes of child labour, linking action for the latter‚Äôs elimination to national development policy, macro-economic trends and strategies, and demographic and labour market processes and outcomes, with particular emphasis on economic and social policies to combat poverty and to promote universal basic education and social mobilization. The TBP‚Äôs time horizon is set in accordance with the prevalence of the WFCL, the availability of resources, the level of local expertise and other conditions prevailing in the country. Focusing heavily on the rapid elimination of the worst forms of child labour, the TBP approach represents a logical progression of IPEC‚Äôs work to date while drawing on the experience that has been accumulating since the programme‚Äôs inception. TBPs pull together many of the successful approaches piloted by IPEC and others in the past into a comprehensive and scaled-up programme combining upstream policy-oriented interventions covering awareness raising, legislation and enforcement, education, employment and social protection with withdrawal and rehabilitation interventions. IPEC sees the TBP as a key strategic approach for attaining large-scale impact on the WFCL.

He is known for his roles as Pete Tyler in Doctor Who, as Reg Trotter in Rock & Chips and as D.C. Mark Rivers in Touching Evil. Early life Shaun Dingwall was born in 1970 and attended Ilford County High School for Boys until 1988. His initial ambition was to become a photographer and for several years he worked as an assistant photographer within the fashion industry and commercial car industry. In 1990 he decided to change direction and attended the Central School of Speech and Drama. Television Dingwall has played leading roles in many drama series such as the BAFTA winning BBC One serial Charles II: The Power and the Passion (as Thomas Osborne, Earl of Danby), directed by Joe Wright.

He is best known for his time with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) from 1995 to 2000, where he held the Cruiserweight Championship once. Professional wrestling career =World Championship Wrestling (1997‚Äì2000)= Early years (1997‚Äì1999) Carlson was trained by Eddie Sharkey and debuted in 1995. He first appeared in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) as Lane Carlson, a jobber. He made his WCW debut on the April 14, 1997 episode of Monday Nitro by losing to the World Television Champion Ultimo Dragon. He later changed his ring name to Lenny Lane on the May 24 episode of Saturday Night during a match against Buff Bagwell, which Carlson lost. He began to wear boots marked \\"LL\\", possibly due to his resemblance to Lex Luger in his early days despite his smaller size. He made his pay-per-view debut at the 1998 Slamboree event as a participant in a battle royal to determine the number one contender for the World Cruiserweight Championship. He was eliminated by Juventud Guerrera. His first storyline saw him as Chris Jericho's lackey. He later began advertising a (fictional) product known as \\"Ab Solution Plus.\\" It was a health drug that supposedly benefited the abdominal muscles. Lane picked up his first victory in WCW on the October 3 episode of Saturday Night against Lash LeRoux. He appeared in the World War 3 battle royal at the eponymous pay-per-view on November 22 for a future shot at the World Heavyweight Championship and Kevin Nash won the match. West Hollywood Blondes and Standards and Practices (1999‚Äì2001) In June 1999 he approached Lodi and stated \\"They're not doing much with me and they're not doing much with you. Why don't we form a tag team?\\" Lane had been inspired by a Saturday Night Live vignette featuring \\"The Ambiguously Gay Duo\\". WCW management were initially reluctant, but booker Kevin Nash approved the idea, and Lane and Lodi were renamed The West Hollywood Blondes (as opposed to the Hollywood Blonds, \\"Stunning\\" Steve Austin and Brian Pillman). The Blondes were implied to be homosexuals, wearing pink trunks emblazoned with large pink triangles (a symbol of the gay community) and with Lane sporting pigtails, facial glitter and a lollipop. Controversially, the Blondes were later revealed to be brothers. The Blondes were an effective villainous tag team, though they rarely won matches. In an upset victory, Lane defeated Rey Mysterio, Jr. on the August 19 episode of WCW Thunder in Lubbock, Texas to win the World Cruiserweight Championship. With the assistance of Lodi, he defended the title successfully including notably against Shaggy 2 Dope of the Insane Clown Posse over the next six weeks. On the October 3 episode of WCW Monday Nitro, Psychosis was announced as having defeated Lane for the World Cruiserweight Championship at an unspecified live event. Lane had already been set to drop the title to Disco Inferno that night, but WCW management was worried about a possible incident. Lane did not appear that night and Psychosis defended and lost the title to Disco instead. The Blondes were taken off television in the same month following protests from the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, who threatened to organize a boycott of WCW, claiming that \\"the character of Lenny is presented with the intention to incite the crowd to the most base homophobic behavior\\" and \\"the audience's reaction [to Lenny Lane and Lodi being physically attacked by other wrestlers] gives permission to viewers to do harm to gay people in a very literal way.\\"Movie & TV News @ IMDb.com - Studio Briefing - 12 October 1999 Lane and Lodi returned as \\"Standards and Practices\\", a censorious duo who opposed the \\"adult themes\\" present in WCW. In a drastic departure from their previous appearance, they wore designer suits, carried briefcases and were accompanied by a secretary, Miss Hancock. Standards and Practices was supposedly an attempt to mock the conservative views of WCW management, and was not unlike the Right to Censor faction the WWF would have shortly afterwards due to complaints from the Parents Television Council over their programming. Miss Hancock eventually abandoned the team. Soon the gimmick of Standards and Practices were dropped on an edition of WCW Nitro when both Lane and Lodi stripped off their suit and tie. In the following weeks, they competed under the tag team name 2XS, a gimmick more resembling two hard rock party goers who wore just jeans to the ring and came out to theme music resembling something from Van Halen. Announcers also began calling Lodi \\"Idol\\" (his name backwards) during the matches. This gimmick too was short lived as they failed to get over, even in a tag team title match and were soon pulled off TV a few weeks later. Both Lane and Lodi were released from WCW in August 2000. Lane briefly reappeared for a short feud with The Wall, but was released once more. =Independent circuit (2000‚Äìpresent)= Lenny Lane moved on to Texas Championship Wrestling, in April 2001, where he formed a tag team with Shane Helms, winning the TCW Tag Team Championships. The team was split when Helms was signed by the World Wrestling Federation. He also appeared on The AWA Stars Tour wrestling in the upper Midwest with Jim Brunzell, Buck \\"Rock n' Roll\\" Zumhofe, Sheik Adnan Al-Kaissy, Mantaur, and others. The Blondes reunited in the now defunct World Wrestling All-Stars promotion in late 2001. Lane was signed by Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (Lodi would have been signed too, but he was injured) and debuted on June 19, 2002. Lane formed a short- lived tag team with Bruce known as The Rainbow Express and competed on the second-ever TNA pay-per-view on June 26. Lane sustained an injury, however, and the team split on November 20, 2002 after Bruce turned on Lane. He left TNA soon after. Lane competed for Steel Domain Wrestling throughout 2003, and for the New Age Wrestling Alliance in 2004 and early 2005. He also works for the American Wrestling League, which is in the same TV slot and wrestles in the same venues as Steel Domain Wrestling did. Lenny Lane currently owns and wrestles for Prime Time Wrestling, an independent wrestling promotion out of Bloomington, Minnesota. He main evented the first show in September defeating Mitch Paradise. In January 2012, Lenny Lane defeated Chiropractor DC to become the first PTW Champion. He would later lose it to him in May. In September, Lenny Lane would defeat Renny D to become the only two-time PTW champion but would lose it to Black Stallion on the same night. In May 2013, Lane defeated Ariya Daivari to become the only three-time PTW Champion. In December of that year a match would take place between John Johnson and Renny D which Renny D would win. Lenny Lane would then award the PTW Championship to Renny D making him a two-time champion. =World Wrestling Entertainment (2004, 2008)= Lane appeared on the October 31, 2004 edition of WWE Heat teaming with Ken Anderson against Rob Conway and Sylvain Grenier and on the September 30, 2008 edition of WWE's ECW on Sci Fi, losing a squash match to Jack Swagger.

Headed by Giacomo da Lentini, they produced more than three-hundred poems of courtly love between 1230 and 1266, the experiment being continued after Frederick's death by his son, Manfred. Origins These poets drew inspiration from the troubadour poetry of Occitania written in langue d'oc, which applied the feudal code of honor to the relation between a man (acting as the vassal) and a woman (acting as king or superior). This is a reversal of the traditional role of women, traditionally dependent on men, and marks a new awareness in medieval society: the decadence of feudalism with the increasing power of the middle class, causes a shift in the reading public, the epic (traditionally devoted to great military pursuits) gradually giving way to the lyric (generally focused on love). In the lower Middle Ages more and more women were reading books than ever before and poetry tried to adapt to their point of view and their newly acquired role in society. Normanni, one of the places that hosted Frederick's Magna Curia This features French poetry, then very influential in Italy. What distinguishes the Sicilian School from the troubadours, however, is the introduction of a kinder, gentler type of woman than that found in their French models; one who was nearer to Dante's madonnas and Petrarch's Laura, though much less characterised psychologically. The poems of the Sicilians hardly portray real women or situations (Frederick's song cannot be read as autobiographical), but the style and language are remarkable, since the Sicilians (as Dante called them) created the first Italian literary standard by enriching the existing vernacular base, probably inspired by popular love songs, with new words of Latin and Proven√ßal origin.  The work of a roving school  \\"It is lyric poetry to be in the forefront of literature, inspiring a widespread enthusiasm whose effects will be felt for centuries. The initial boost given by the Sicilian poets from the Svevs' court, the first to use a standardised vernacular to make art poetry will be passed on to many others: and all of them, not just the pedantic imitators of the Siculo-Tuscan school (such as Bonagiunta Orbicciani) but also Guinizzelli, the poets of Dolce Stil Novo and more widely all writers of verse, will have to deal, though by different degrees, with the Sicilian models, so that some peculiarities will be assimilated into standard usage of Italian poetry.\\" (Bruno Migliorini, Storia della letteratura italiana) Though yet confined to a few notaries and dignitaries of the emperors, such poetry shows for the first time uniform linguistic traits and a richness in vocabulary far exceeding that of the Sicilian language by which it was inspired. The Magna curia was not based in any given city, but always moving across Southern Italy, a fact which helped the school avoid the temptation of choosing any local dialect as the starting point for their new language. That is why the new standard was a Koin√© language, a melting pot of many different vernaculars. The reason for moving from city to city was mainly political. Although his experiment was short-lived, Frederic successfully created the first modern state in Europe, run by an efficient bureaucracy: its members were neither appointed from the aristocracy nor the clergy with good reason, since the former were far more interested in defending their own privileges than the welfare of the country and often plotted against him in the hope of regaining their power, while the latter were basically faithful to the Pope, his biggest enemy. Frederic was in fact dismantling the feudal system of government inherited from the Normans, his magna curia and minor dignitaries were usually chosen from lay orders (like his poet-notaries). He also abolished internal barriers: free trade brought prosperity to the South, making Bari (as witnessed by Cielo in his Contrasto) one of the richest cities in the Mediterranean. But, keeping this modern state afloat, meant that his barons had no power to collect taxes, their greatest source of revenues. Hence the necessity for Frederick to bring law and order by moving his court to and fro.  Style and subject-matter  Though the Sicilian School is generally considered conventional in theme or content it rather \\"stands out for his refined lexicon, near to the style of trobar clus and for the wise treatment of figures of speech and metaphors of stylnovistic taste taken from natural philosophy\\" (Cesare Segre). There is a visible move towards neoplatonic models, which will be embraced by Dolce Stil Novo in the later 13th century Bologna and Florence, and more markedly by Petrarch. Unlike the Northern Italian troubadours, no line is ever written in Occitan. Rather, the Occitan repertoire of chivalry terms is adapted to the Siculo-Italian phonetics and morphology, so that new Italian words are actually coined, some adapted, but none really loaned. A most famous specimen is Io m'aggio posto in core by Giacomo da Lentini, who apparently inspired the movement. Giacomo da Lentini is also widely credited by scholars (as Francesco Bruni, Cesare Segre et al.) for inventing the sonnet, a literary form later perfected by Dante and, most of all, Petrarch. He uses it in a number of poems. We quote here the most famous that probably inspired the whole school: The limitations of Sicilian poetry De arte venandi cum avibus of Frederick II The main inhibiting factor on Sicilian poetry was probably the political censorship imposed by Frederick: literary debate was confined to courtly love. In this respect, the poetry of the north, though stuck to the langues d'o√Øl, provided fresher blood for satire. The north was fragmented into communes or little city-states which had a relatively democratic self-government, and that is precisely why the sirventese genre, and later, Dante's Divina Commedia and sonnets were so popular: they referred to real people and feelings, though often idealised like Beatrice. A sirventese is, in effect, eminently political: it usually refers to real battles and attacks real military or political enemies, the author often being the soldier or the knight involved in the strife, as in Guittone d'Arezzo's Rotta di Montaperti (Defeat of Montaperti), a bloody battle where Manfred of Sicily, Frederick's son, defeated the guelfs. Dante himself will commemorate the event in the Commedia many years later, where, mindful of the political strife that had him exiled, he will attack many princes and popes, such as Boniface VIII, one of his biggest personal enemies. Frederick's censorship is also apparent from the structure of the song: the Sicilians transformed the tornada, the strophe which in troubadour poetry contains a dedication to a famous person with a congedo, where the poet bids goodbye to his reader and asks the song to bear his message to his lady. The re-shaping of the Occitan model also involved the suppression of music. The authors were great readers and translators, but apparently could not play any instrument, so their work was intended for reading, which called for logical unity, posing a question, proposing, and finding a solution in the end. That meant no interchangeable lines as in troubadour poetry and fewer repetitions: for a French jongleur who sang his poems these were necessary, but they sounded redundant to the Sicilian authors. Their poetry was music to the eye, not to the ear, and their legacy is also apparent in Dante and Petrarch's lyrics. The sonnet is even more exacting on this point: the separation between the octave and the sestet is purely a logical one, the rimes drawing a visual line between the first and last part. However, the fact that Italian poetry was being made for the reading public may have facilitated its circulation.  Realism and parody: Cielo d'Alcamo  Cielo d'Alcamo Villa Giulia (Palermo) Frederick's Augustale (c. 1250), a valued currency widely used throughout Italy is mentioned in the Contrasto, and helped scholars establish its date. Though lyric poetry prevailed at Frederick's (and later Manfredi's) court, it is at this time that we have an interesting exception in Rosa fresca aulentissima (transl: \\"Fresh very perfumed rose\\"), widely known as Contrasto and attributed to Cielo d'Alcamo (also known as Ciullu di Vincenzullu), about which modern critics have much exercised themselves. This Contrasto is written in a Sicilian language close to that spoken in the city of Messina, with several influences from continental Italian variants. The subject is a humorous fight between two young lovers, a kind of poetry quite common in the Middle Ages (as contrasti or pastorelle). It is about a young suitor who sneaks into the garden of a young lady from a rich Sicilian family and secretly declares his love to her. He then tries to seduce the girl with his one-liners; she berates him for his \\"ill\\" intentions and keeps him at bay to protect her honor, but her prudeness proves eventually to be just a love game: she gives in completely to his bold advances. However, the language uses much of the courtly language of lyric poetry and the result is a parody of the Sicilian School's clich√©s. The Contrasto belongs to the time of the emperor Frederick II (it can be dated between 1230 and 1250, but probably closer to the latter), and is also important as a proof that there once existed a popular, independent of literary, poetry prior to Frederick's times. Now most critics agree that the Contrasto of Cielo d'Alcamo is probably a scholarly re-elaboration of some lost popular song. It is perhaps the closest to a kind of poetry that has perished or which was smothered by the Sicilian literature of Frederick's. Its distinguishing feature was its hilarity and down-to-earthedness as opposed to the abstract verse of the Sicilian School. But it has been argued that its style betrays a profound knowledge of Frederick's movement and some critics have hinted the man who penned it must have been acquainted with or even been part of, the court itself. Given the highly satiric and erotic vein Ciullo d'Alcamo may well be a fictitious name. His Contrasto shows vigor and freshness in the expression of feelings: Such \\"low\\" treatment of the love-theme shows that its subject-matter is certainly popular. This poem sounds real and spontaneous, marked as it is by the sensuality characteristic of the people of southern Italy.  Linguistic notes on the Sicilian standard  The standard of the Sicilian school combines many traits typical of the Sicilian, Latin, Proven√ßal and to a lesser, but not negligible extent, Apulian and certain southern dialects. Such a melting pot greatly helped the new Italian language: the Proven√ßal suffixes -i√®re and -ce, for example, generated hundreds of new Italian words in -iera and -za as it. riv-iera (\\"river\\") or costan-za (\\"constancy\\"). Such affixes would be then adopted by Dante and his contemporaries, and handed on to future generations of Italian writers. Dante's styles illustre, cardinale, aulico, curiale were partly developed from his close study of the Sicilian School which he quotes widely in his studies, especially in his De Vulgari Eloquentia. The Sicilian school was later re-founded by Guittone d'Arezzo in Tuscany following the death of Manfredi, Frederick's son, so many of these poems were later copied in manuscripts that widely circulated in Florence. This first standard in which they were written, was, however, modified in Tuscany. In fact, Tuscan scriveners perceived the five-vowel system used by southern Italian dialects (i, e, a, o, u) as a seven-vowel one (i, √©, √®, a, √≥, √≤, u). As a consequence, the Italian texts may contain lines that no longer rhyme with each other (sic. -i > tusc. -√©, sic. -u > tusc. -√≥). Tuscans also changed words as gloria [pron. gl√≤ria] to ghiora, aju [pron. √†yu] (\\"I have) to aggio [pron. adjo] etc. Though some original texts have been restored to their original Sicilian, we must see such remakes only as tentative reconstructions of originals that, unfortunately, may have been lost forever. Dante and his contemporaries would take this newborn language a step further, expanding and enriching it with even more words of Latin and Florentine origin, carefully working on the style to create volgare illustre, a higher standard quite close to today's Standard Italian.

It also refers to a type of performance dance developed by the Ukrainian diaspora in North America. It originated in the eastern Galician (Modern West Ukrainian) town of Kolomyia (Hutsulshchyna). It was historically popular among the Ukrainians and Poles, and is also known in north-eastern Slovenia where in Austro-Hungarian times some Ukrainians settled (as the kalamajka) .Ba≈°, Angelos. 1980. Slovensko ljudsko izroƒçilo: pregled etnologije Slovencev. Ljubljana: Cankarjeva zalo≈æba, p. 228. Kolomyjkas are still danced in Ukraine, as a tradition on certain holidays, during festivities, or simply for fun. In Ukraine's west, they are popular dances for weddings. The Kolomyka can be a combination of tune, song, and dance with some recordings having a line of singing alternating with a line of instrumental melody, whilst others are purely instrumental. The text tends to be in rhyming couplets and is a humorous commentary on everyday life. Its simple 2/4 rhythm and structures make the kolomyka very adaptable, and the text and melodies of thousands of different versions have been annotated. One collection done by Volodymyr Shukhevych in 1905, contains more than 8,000. Although a very old form they continue to be popular due to their fast, energetic and exciting melodies often with syncopation.  Bela Bartok and the Kolomyjka  Hungarian composer Bela Bartok's first concerto for piano and orchestra incorporates a rhythmic and melodic scheme that has a symmetrical structure, combining two measure units, that move typically in a narrow stepwise motion and often use scalar patterns and note repetitions. In Hungary, this rhythmic type is associated with the swineherd dance that Bartok believed was derived from the Ukrainian kolomyka. Bartok also considered the swineherd songs to be the source of the popular kurucz song repertoire and of the instrumental verbunktos, suggesting that these too were based on Kolomyka melodies-\\"The latter (Verunkos), again, seems at least partially a derivation from the so-called Hungarian Sheperd-dance melodies whose source is probably the Ukrainian Kolomyjka dance-melodies\\" (Bela Bartok), \\"Concerning the origin of the Rumanian (b) 1 and (c) types, let us indicate two alternatives, however, in principle equally possible. They may have originated directly from either the Verbunkos music or the Ukrainian Kolomyjka. The latter alternative is likely because of the comparatively long frontier between Rumanian and Ukrainian linguistic territory.\\" (Bela Bartok)  Development in the diaspora  In North America, the kolomyjka is primarily a social dance. Participants form a circle, joining hands. The dance begins with the participants turning the circle, usually counterclockwise, then clockwise, or by forming a spiral. Further into the dance soloists will perform in the centre of the circle. According to Andriy Nahachewsky, a former professional stage dancer, Director of the Kule Centre for Ukrainian and Canadian Folklore, and Huculak Chair of Ukrainian Culture and Ethnography at the University of Alberta, kolomyjky as practised in Canada are a separate genre of dance from what is known in Ukraine. The diasporic kolomyjka developed from the old country folk dance but with a prevailing influence from stage dancing. Originating in Western Canada in the 1950s and 60s, the kolomyjka is considered the highlight of Ukrainian weddings and dances in Canada: when any attendees who have experience as stage dancers perform their favourite \\"tricks\\" involving lifts, spins, high kicks, even building human pyramids. It is a chance for individuals and groups to \\"show off\\" their most impressive or dangerous moves so as to entertain the audience and win approval. Nahachewsky suggests that despite being a relatively new tradition the Canadian kolomyjka is an important symbol of Ukrainian culture in Canada and that the dynamism of this type of Ukrainian dance helps to interest young people in Canada in retaining Ukrainian culture.

Biography He was born at Florence, the son of a burgher named Marco Magliabechi, and Ginevra Baldorietta. Although Magliabechi was apprenticed to a goldsmith, and worked in this capacity until his fortieth year, Michele Ermini, librarian to Cardinal de' Medici, recognized his academic ability and taught him Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. In 1673 he became librarian to Cosimo III de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany. Magliabechi became the central figure of literary life in Florence, and scholars of every nation sought his acquaintance and corresponded with him. Whilst this eminent post gave him considerable prominence, he is remembered more for his personal characteristics and his vast store of self-acquired learning. He has been described as a literary glutton, and the most rational of bibliomaniacs, inasmuch as he read everything he bought. His own library consisted of 40,000 books and 10,000 manuscripts. His house literally overflowed with books; the stairways were lined with them, and they even filled the front porch. Many stories are told of his marvellous memory that was \\"like wax to receive and marble to retain.\\" In worldly matters Magliabechi was extremely negligent. Reputedly, he once even forgot to draw his salary for over a year. He wore his clothes until they fell from him, and thought it a great waste of time to undress at night, \\"life being so short and books so plentiful\\". He welcomed all inquiring scholars, provided they did not disturb him while at work. He had a hearty dislike for Jesuits. The story goes that one day in pointing out the Palazzo Riccardi to a stranger he said, \\"Here the new birth of learning took place,\\" and then turning to the college of the Jesuits, \\"There they have come back to bury it.\\" Magliabecchi died at the age of 81, in 1714, at the monastery of Sta. Maria Novella. He left his books to the Grand Duke to be used as a public library; his fortune went to the poor. His library, known as the \\"Magliabechiana\\", was combined with the grand-ducal private library by Victor Emmanuel II of Italy in 1861, the two forming the core of the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale Firenze. Eccentricities Magliabechi was known as an eccentric. He was a man of a most forbidding and savage aspect, and exceedingly negligent of his person. He refused to be waited upon. His diet was commonly three hard-boiled eggs, with a draught of water.Newman, Jeremiah Whitaker. (1838). The Lounger's Common-Place Book, Volume 2. London. p. 5Brewer, Ebenezer Cobham. (1880). The Reader's Handbook of Allusions, References, Plots and Stories: With Two Appendices. Lippincott. p. 592 Magliabechi did not care about personal hygiene and slept in his clothes. He had a small window in his door, through which he could see all those who approached him; and if he did not wish for their company, he would not admit them. He spent some hours in each day at the palace library; but is said never in his life to have gone farther from Florence than to Prato, whither he once accompanied Cardinal Henry Norris, librarian at the Vatican, to see a manuscript.

It is a rare autosomal recessive disorder resulting from accumulation of free cystine in lysosomes, eventually leading to intracellular crystal formation throughout the body. Cystinosis is the most common cause of Fanconi syndrome in the pediatric age group. Fanconi syndrome occurs when the function of cells in renal tubules is impaired, leading to abnormal amounts of carbohydrates and amino acids in the urine, excessive urination, and low blood levels of potassium and phosphates. Cystinosis was the first documented genetic disease belonging to the group of lysosomal storage disease disorders.Nesterova G, Gahl WA. Cystinosis: the evolution of a treatable disease. Pediatr Nephrol 2012;28:51‚Äì9. Cystinosis is caused by mutations in the CTNS gene that codes for cystinosin, the lysosomal membrane-specific transporter for cystine. Intracellular metabolism of cystine, as it happens with all amino acids, requires its transport across the cell membrane. After degradation of endocytosed protein to cystine within lysosomes, it is normally transported to the cytosol. But if there is a defect in the carrier protein, cystine is accumulated in lysosomes. As cystine is highly insoluble, when its concentration in tissue lysosomes increases, its solubility is immediately exceeded and crystalline precipitates are formed in almost all organs and tissues.Gahl WA, Thoene JG, Schneider JA. Cystinosis. N Engl J Med 2002;347:111-121. However, the progression of the disease is not related to the presence of crystals in target tissues. Although tissue damage might depend on cystine accumulation, the mechanisms of tissue damage are not fully understood. Increased intracellular cystine profoundly disturbs cellular oxidative metabolism and glutathione status,Kumar A, Bachhawat AK. A futile cycle, formed between two ATP-dependent Œ≥-glutamyl cycle enzymes, Œ≥-glutamyl cysteine synthetase and 5-oxoprolinase: the cause of cellular ATP depletion in nephrotic cystinosis?; J Biosci 2010;35:21‚Äì25. leading to altered mitochondrial energy metabolism, autophagy, and apoptosis.Park MA, Thoene JG. Potential role of apoptosis in development of the cystinotic phenotype. Pediatr Nephrol 2005;20:441‚Äì446. Cystinosis is usually treated with cysteamine, which is prescribed to decrease intralysosomal cystine accumulation.Besouw M, Masereeuw R, Van den Heuvel L et al. Cysteamine: an old drug with new potential. Drug Discov Today 2013. However, the discovery of new pathogenic mechanisms and the development of an animal model of the disease may open possibilities for the development of new treatment modalities to improve long-term prognosis. Symptoms There (are) three distinct types of cystinosis each with slightly different symptoms: nephropathic cystinosis, intermediate cystinosis, and non-nephropathic or ocular cystinosis. Infants affected by nephropathic cystinosis initially exhibit poor growth and particular kidney problems (sometimes called renal Fanconi syndrome). The kidney problems lead to the loss of important minerals, salts, fluids, and other nutrients. The loss of nutrients not only impairs growth, but may result in soft, bowed bones (hypophosphatemic rickets), especially in the legs. The nutrient imbalances in the body lead to increased urination, thirst, dehydration, and abnormally acidic blood (acidosis). Slit-lamp photographs of three-year-old patient with nephropathic cystinosis before (left) and after (right) cysteamine eyedrop therapy. The drops dissolve the crystals in the cornea. By about age two, cystine crystals may also be present in the cornea. The buildup of these crystals in the eye causes an increased sensitivity to light (photophobia). Without treatment, children with cystinosis are likely to experience complete kidney failure by about age ten. With treatment this may be delayed into the patients teens or 20s. Other signs and symptoms that may occur in patients include muscle deterioration, blindness, inability to swallow, impaired sweating, decreased hair and skin pigmentation, diabetes, and thyroid and nervous system problems. The signs and symptoms of intermediate cystinosis are the same as nephropathic cystinosis, but they occur at a later age. Intermediate cystinosis typically begins to affect individuals around age twelve to fifteen. Malfunctioning kidneys and corneal crystals are the main initial features of this disorder. If intermediate cystinosis is left untreated, complete kidney failure will occur, but usually not until the late teens to mid twenties. People with non-nephropathic or ocular cystinosis do not usually experience growth impairment or kidney malfunction. The only symptom is photophobia due to cystine crystals in the cornea. =Crystal morphology and identification= Cystine crystals are hexagonal in shape and are colorless. They are not found often in alkaline urine due to their high solubility. The colorless crystals can be difficult to distinguish from uric acid crystals which are also hexagonal. Under polarized examination, the crystals are birefringent with a polarization color interference. Genetics Cystinosis has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Cystinosis occurs due to a mutation in the gene CTNS, located on chromosome 17, which codes for cystinosin, the lysosomal cystine transporter. Symptoms are first seen at about 3 to 18 months of age with profound polyuria (excessive urination), followed by poor growth, photophobia, and ultimately kidney failure by age 6 years in the nephropathic form. All forms of cystinosis (nephropathic, juvenile and ocular) are autosomal recessive, which means that the trait is located on an autosomal gene, and an individual who inherits two copies of the gene ‚Äì one from both parents ‚Äì will have the disorder. There is a 25% risk of having a child with the disorder, when both parents are carriers of an autosomal recessive trait. Cystinosis affects approximately 1 in 100,000 to 200,000 newborns. and there are only around 2,000 known individuals with cystinosis in the world. The incidence is higher in the province of Brittany, France, where the disorder affects 1 in 26,000 individuals. Diagnosis Cystinosis is a rare genetic disorder that causes an accumulation of the amino acid cystine within cells, forming crystals that can build up and damage the cells. These crystals negatively affect many systems in the body, especially the kidneys and eyes. The accumulation is caused by abnormal transport of cystine from lysosomes, resulting in a massive intra-lysosomal cystine accumulation in tissues. Via an as yet unknown mechanism, lysosomal cystine appears to amplify and alter apoptosis in such a way that cells die inappropriately, leading to loss of renal epithelial cells. This results in renal Fanconi syndrome, and similar loss in other tissues can account for the short stature, retinopathy, and other features of the disease. Definitive diagnosis and treatment monitoring are most often performed through measurement of white blood cell cystine level using tandem mass spectrometry. =Types= * ‚Äì Infantile nephropathic * ‚Äì Adolescent nephropathic * ‚Äì Adult nonnephropathic Treatment Cystinosis is normally treated with cysteamine, which is available in capsules and in eye drops. People with cystinosis are also often given sodium citrate to treat the blood acidosis, as well as potassium and phosphorus supplements as well as others. If the kidneys become significantly impaired or fail, then treatment must be begun to ensure continued survival, up to and including renal transplantation.

Inside the tram The Colonial Tramcar Restaurant is a restaurant operating from a converted fleet of three vintage W class trams in Melbourne, Australia. The Colonial Tramcar Restaurant Company Limited was formed in 1981 to operate restaurant trams, with 1927 W2 class tram number 442 acquired for conversion after 55 years of Melbourne & Metropolitan Tramways Board service.Tram-rolling-stock-Part-3 : Page 48, Heritage Victoria, ...Designation:W2 442.

Conversion work commenced in 1982 at Preston Workshops, with the drop centre floor raised to give a level floor throughout, and a single entry door provided on one side of the tram. Two saloons were provided either side of a central kitchen and washroom, one saloon seating 12 while the other seats 24 patrons. It was based at the Metropolitan Transit Authority's (MTA) South Melbourne depot.\\"News in Brief\\" Trolley Wire issue 203 December 1982 page 2\\"The City of Melbourne: Dining in Style by Tram\\" Trolley Wire issue 214 October 1984 pages 3-11 The service started on 2 November 1982 (Melbourne Cup day) with the single tram, as amendments were required to the Liquor Licence Act to allow for the service of alcohol on a mobile restaurant. The driver and conductor were provided by the MTA while onboard staff are Colonial Tramcar Restaurant employees. Until 1992, the restaurant had to carry a conductor to comply with tramways union regulations about two-man teams operating all trams (in case the brakes failed). This conductor cost the Colonial Tramcar Restaurant $50,000 per year until former premier Jeff Kennett did away with the need for conductors. One of the conductors was a lady who could be seen knitting throughout the entire service. Two 1948 SW6 class trams, 937 and 939, were later added to the fleet in October 1992 and February 1995 respectively.\\"Melbourne News\\" Trolley Wire issue 251 November 1992 page 24\\"Melbourne Trams\\" Trolley Wire issue 261 May 1995 page 17 With the closure of South Melbourne depot in February 1997, operation was transferred to Southbank depot.\\"Melbourne Notes\\" Trolley Wire issue 270 August 1997 page 25 In 2006 the 442 was retired and replaced with a third SW6 class tram 938.\\"Restaurant tram No 442\\" Trolley Wire issue 304 February 2006 page 11 In 2011 nos 937 and 939 were withdrawn from service and replaced with 935 and 964. All have distinctive burgundy livery, and can seat 36 passengers each. The restaurant, which has one lunch and two dinner sittings each day, advises booking well in advance. The trams are boarded from the Clarendon Street Junction stop near the Melbourne Exhibition and Convention Centre. They then run on selected standard tram routes through the city and some nearby inner suburbs, returning to their origin. The ride in the restaurant tram is generally quite steady. Food is prepared offsite in a commercial kitchen and is loaded onto the trams in a raw form. Each tram has its own chef and all of the food is freshly cooked as the tram is moving. The menu provides a limited choice, as does the wine list. However, unlimited alcohol is included in the fixed, prepaid meal price. On 11 August 2012, 30 diners and three staff had to be evacuated from one of the restaurant tramcars after it caught fire in East Melbourne. In 1985 The Colonial Tramcar Restaurant became the first restaurant in Melbourne to ban smoking. The Colonial Tramcar Restaurant is a four-time winner of the coveted National Tourism Award (1984, 1988, 1992, and 1993). It is also a nine-time winner of the Victorian Tourism Award (1984, 1985, 1986, 1988, 1989, 1991, 1992, 1993, 2002) and was welcomed into the Hall of Fame in 1993. Hall of Fame is awarded to an entrant that has won the same category over three consecutive years. On 19 October 2018, Yarra Trams announced that the restaurant trams had been withdrawn from service and were no longer allowed to operate on the network due to safety considerations. At the same time, Yarra Trams said it was working with the restaurant operator to enable a \\"stationary dining experience\\" to continue.

Sanders is best known for his time in World Championship Wrestling, where he was a one time Cruiserweight Champion. Early life Sanders was named in honor of the Apollo 11 astronauts Michael Collins, Edwin \\"Buzz\\" E. Aldrin, Jr. and Neil A. Armstrong as Sanders was born on the day the moon landing occurred. Professional wrestling career =World Championship Wrestling (1998‚Äì2001)= After beginning his training at the Power Plant in June 1998, Sanders made his World Championship Wrestling debut on the October 10, 1998 episode of Saturday Night in a losing effort to Chavo Guerrero, Jr.. After being utilized as a jobber in a handful of matches on Saturday Night and WorldWide throughout 1998 and 1999, Sanders picked up his first victory on the July 19, 2000 episode of Thunder by defeating Crowbar. Sanders was introduced in mid-2000 as \\"Above Average\\" Mike Sanders. On the August 16 episode of Thunder, Sanders was courted by Disco Inferno to join The Filthy Animals. After accompanying Rey Mysterio, Jr. and Juventud Guerrera for their tag team match against Sean O'Haire and Mark Jindrak, Sanders turned on the Animals and, along with Chuck Palumbo, Shawn Stasiak, and Reno, helped O'Haire and Jindrak attack the Animals and lose the match via disqualification in the process. On the August 21 episode of Nitro, the stable was named The Natural Born Thrillers, with Sanders serving as the stable's mouthpiece. After Sanders was interrupted during a promo by Filthy Animal member Konnan, the Thrillers (Sanders, Jindrak, and O'Haire) subsequently defeated the Animals (Mysterio, Jr., Guerrera, and Disco Inferno) in a six-man tag team match. The Thrillers continued their feud with the Animals, with Sanders defeating the Inferno on the August 23 episode of Thunder and the Thrillers defeating the Animals in an elimination match. On September 17 at Fall Brawl, the Thrillers faced the Animals, Big Vito and their mystery partner (later revealed to be Paul Orndorff) in an elimination match, which ended in a no-contest due to Orndorff suffering a stinger during the match. The Thrillers would then go on to lose a two-on-five handicap match against the Animals on the September 18 episode of Nitro despite having a numerical advantage, ending the feud between the two stables. Following their feud with the Filthy Animals, the Natural Born Thrillers would go on to lose to The Jung Dragons on the September 20 episode of Thunder. After naming himself the new WCW Commissioner on the September 27 episode of Thunder, the Thrillers gained Kevin Nash as a \\"coach\\". With Nash, Sanders defeated then- Cruiserweight Champion Elix Skipper in a handicap powerbomb match orchestrated by Sanders on the October 2 episode of Nitro, resulting in Sanders becoming the new Cruiserweight Champion. He then went on to retain the Cruiserweight Title against Lance Storm in his first title defense on the October 4 episode of Thunder. Sanders then entered into a feud with Ernest Miller over the Commissionership, and defeated Miller in a kickboxing match at Halloween Havoc on October 29 to retain his position as Commissioner thanks to interference by Shane Douglas. The Thrillers then ended their alliance with Nash by attacking him during a title match against then-World Heavyweight Champion Booker T, after finding Nash no longer useful due to Sanders being the new Commissioner. The Thrillers then lost to Nash in a handicap match via disqualification on the November 12 episode of Nitro. On November 16 at the Millennium Final pay- per-view, Miller defeated Sanders to become the new WCW Commissioner. After retaining the Cruiserweight Title against Kwee Wee on November 26 at Mayhem, Sanders lost the title to Chavo Guerrero, Jr. on the December 6 episode of Thunder. On the December 12 episode of Nitro, Sanders was squashed by Sid, though the Thrillers would manage to defeat The Insiders (Nash and Diamond Dallas Page) in a handicap match later in the night in what turned out to be the Thrillers' final match together. At Sin on January 14, 2001, Sanders faced Miller in a rematch for the Commissionership, but was once again defeated. Following this, Sanders teamed with Kwee Wee and lost to the Jung Dragons in a first round match of a tournament to crown the inaugural Cruiserweight Tag Team Champions. On the final episode of Thunder on March 14, Sanders wrestled his final match for WCW as he and Disqo lost to Konnan and Hugh Morrus in a tag team match. In late March 2001, the World Wrestling Federation bought out WCW. =World Wrestling Federation / Entertainment (2001‚Äì2002)= When WCW was purchased by the World Wrestling Federation, Sanders' contract was acquired as part of the deal and he was then sent to Heartland Wrestling Association (HWA), one of the WWF's developmental territories. While there, he was a member of the Team WCW stable along with fellow WCW alumni Johnny The Bull, Reno, Mark Jindrak, Jason Jett, Lash LeRoux, Shannon Moore, Evan Karagias, Kwee Wee, Elix Skipper, and Jamie Knoble. Sanders later formed a tag team with Lance Cade called Natural Born Attitudes, and on February 13, 2002, the duo captured the HWA Tag Team Championship belts after defeating Val Venis and Steve Bradley. However, the Tag Team Title was vacated that same day, and Cade defeated Sanders on February 20 to win the title and subsequently named Bradley as his tag team partner.HWA results In March 2002, Sanders became the head booker of HWA after suffering a foot injury. On June 24, 2002, Sanders wrestled his only match for the now-renamed World Wrestling Entertainment as he and Jason Sugarman defeated B.J. Payne and Steve Bradley in a tag team dark match before Sunday Night Heat. He was released from the company on July 19, 2002. =Independent circuit and retirement (2002‚Äì2003, 2005)= After a brief tour with World Wrestling All-Stars in 2002 as the promotion's Commissioner, Sanders debuted in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling on January 15, 2003, where he lost to Jerry Lynn. Sanders then immediately joined Sports Entertainment Xtreme (S.E.X.), the top heel stable in TNA. On January 22, Sanders picked up his first victory in TNA as he and David Flair defeated Lynn and Ron Killings in a tag team match. After mixed success over the next few months, Sanders challenged Kid Kash for the X Division Championship, but was unable to win the title. On May 21, Sanders entered the Hard 10 Tournament and defeated Brian Lee in the first round. On June 18, Sanders lost to New Jack in the semi- finals. Sanders wrestled his final match for TNA on July 2, where he lost to Shark Boy. After taking a two-year hiatus, Sanders returned to wrestling on February 20, 2005 for Vince Russo's Ring of Glory promotion, where he and Glenn Gilbertti defeated Adam Jacobs and Johnny Swinger. On December 16, Sanders returned to Ring of Glory and wrestled his final match, as he and Erik Watts lost to Gilbertti and D'Lo Brown. Comedy career After his final match in 2005, Sanders performed his first open mic at The Punchline, a comedy club in Sandy Springs, Georgia. Since then, Sanders has gone on to become a full-time stand-up comedian and improv actor, and has also worked alongside fellow comedians Tommy Davidson, Mark Lundholm, Diana Jordan, Craig Robinson and Vinnie Coppola. He currently performs at clubs and corporate events and gives motivational speeches. Personal life Sanders' father runs a towing business. Sanders owns \\"Roll Speed Media\\", a talent solutions company that represents actors in Atlanta; he also owns \\"The Party Paramedic\\", a DJ and entertainment company for weddings, parties, corporate events and trade shows. Sanders has been divorced twice; he and his ex-wife DeLana have two children, Kenneth and Alexis.[Stated in the May 2001 issue of WOW Magazine Pg. 57.] Sanders remains good friends with former WCW creative writer Vince Russo and fellow professional wrestlers Chuck Palumbo, Disco Inferno, Mark Jindrak and Sean O'Haire until O'Haire's death.

His older brother was the pedagogue, composer, conductor and pianist Eduard Zuckmayer. Life and career Carl sen., Amalie, Carl jun., Eduard Born in Nackenheim in Rhenish Hesse, he was the second son of Amalie (1869‚Äì1954), n√©e Goldschmidt, and Carl Zuckmayer (1864‚Äì1947). When he was four years old, his family moved to Mainz. With the outbreak of World War I, he (like many other high school students) finished Rabanus-Maurus- Gymnasium with a facilitated \\"emergency\\"-Abitur and volunteered for military service. During the war he served with the German Army's Field Artillery on the Western Front. In 1917, he published first poems in the pacifist journal Die Aktion and he was one of the signatures of the Appeal published by the Antinational Socialist Party after the German Revolution of 9 November 1918. By this time Zuckmayer held the rank of a Leutnant der Reserve (Reserve Officer). After the war, he took up studies at the University of Frankfurt, first in humanities, later in biology and botany. In 1920, he married his childhood friend Annemarie Ganz, but they were divorced just one year later, when Zuckmayer had an affair with actress Annemarie Seidel. His first ventures into literature and theatre were complete failures. His first drama Kreuzweg (1921) fell flat and was delisted after only three performances, and when he was chosen as dramatic adviser at the theatre of Kiel, he lost his new job after his first, controversial staging of Terence's The Eunuch. In 1924 he became dramaturg at the Deutsches Theater in Berlin, jointly with Bertolt Brecht. After another failure with his second drama Pankraz erwacht oder Die Hinterw√§ldler he finally had a great public success with the rustic comedy Der fr√∂hliche Weinberg (\\"The Merry Vineyard\\") in 1925, written in his local Mainz- Frankfurt dialect. This work won him the prestigious Kleist Prize two years after it was awarded to Brecht, and launched his career.Mitchell, Allan, Unrepentant Patriot: The LIfe and Work of Carl Zuckmayer, p. 23-24 Also in 1925, he married the Austrian actress Alice Herdan, and they bought a house in Henndorf near Salzburg in Austria. Zuckmayer's next play Der Schinderhannes was again successful. In 1929, he wrote the script for the movie Der blaue Engel (starring Marlene Dietrich) based on the novel Professor Unrat by Heinrich Mann. That year, he was also awarded the Georg B√ºchner Prize, another prestigious German language literary award. In 1931, his play Der Hauptmann von K√∂penick premiered and became another success, but his plays were prohibited when the Nazis came to power in Germany in 1933 (Zuckmayer's maternal grandfather had been born Jewish and converted to Protestantism). Zuckmayer and his family moved to their house in Austria, where he published a few more works. After the Anschluss, he was expatriated by the Nazi government, and the Zuckmayers fled via Switzerland to the United States in 1939, where he first worked as a script writer in Hollywood before renting Backwoods Farm near Barnard, Vermont in 1941 and working there as a farmer until 1946. In 1943/44 he wrote \\"character portraits\\" of actors, writers and other artists in Germany for the Office of Strategic Services, evaluating their involvement with the Nazi regime. This became known only in 2002, when the approximately 150 reports were published in Germany under the title Geheimreport. The family's Vermont years are narrated in Alice Herdan Zuckmayer's Die Farm in den gr√ºnen Bergen (The Farm in the Green Mountains), a best seller in Germany upon its 1949 publication. In January 1946, after World War II, Zuckmayer was granted the US citizenship he had applied for already in 1943. He returned to Germany and traveled the country for five months as a US cultural attach√©. The resulting report to the War Department was first published in Germany in 2004 (Deutschlandbericht). His play Des Teufels General (\\"The Devil's General\\"; the main character is based on the biography of Ernst Udet), which he had written in Vermont, premiered in Z√ºrich on 14 December 1946. The play became a major success in post-war Germany; one of the first post-war literary attempts to broach the issue of Nazism. It was filmed in 1955 starring Curd J√ºrgens. Zuckmayer in Amsterdam (1956) Zuckmayer kept writing: Barbara Blomberg premiered in Konstanz in 1949 and Das kalte Licht in Hamburg in 1955. He also wrote the screenplay for Die Jungfrau auf dem Dach, the German-language version of Otto Preminger's 1953 film The Moon is Blue. Having shuttled back and forth between the U.S. and Europe for several years, the Zuckmayers left the U.S. in 1958 and settled in Saas Fee in the Valais in Switzerland. In 1966, he became a Swiss citizen, and he published his memoirs entitled Als w√§r's ein St√ºck von mira quotation from the poem Ich hatt' einen Kameraden (\\"A part of myself\\"). His last play Der Rattenf√§nger (music by Friedrich Cerha) premiered in Z√ºrich in 1975. Zuckmayer died on 18 January 1977 in Visp. His body was interred on 22 January in Saas Fee. Zuckmayer had been granted numerous awards, such as the Goethe Prize of the city of Frankfurt in 1952, the Bundesverdienstkreuz mit Stern in 1955, the Austrian Staatspreis f√ºr Literatur in 1960, Pour le M√©rite in 1967, and the Austrian Verdienstkreuz am Band in 1968.

IPEC's aim is to work towards the progressive elimination of child labour by strengthening national capacities to address child labour problems, and by creating a worldwide movement to combat it. About IPEC‚Äôs priority target groups are children in worst forms of child labour such as slavery and practices similar to slavery, such as bonded child labour and children in hazardous working conditions and occupations. IPEC also focuses on children who are particularly vulnerable, i.e. very young working children (below 12 years of age), and working girl children. The political will and commitment of individual governments to address child labour in cooperation with employers' and workers' organizations, other non-governmental organizations and relevant parties in society ‚Äì such as universities and the media ‚Äì is the starting point for all IPEC action. Sustainability is built in from the start through an emphasis on in-country \\"ownership\\". Support is given to partner organizations to develop and implement measures which aim at preventing child labour, withdrawing children from hazardous work and providing alternatives, and improving the working conditions as a transitional measure towards the elimination of child labour. Strategy A phased and multi-sectoral strategy is applied consisting of the following steps: *Motivating an alliance of partners to acknowledge and act against child labour. *Carrying out a situational analysis to find out about child labour problems in a country. *Assisting with developing and implementing national policies on child labour problems. *Strengthening existing organizations and setting up institutional mechanisms. *Creating awareness on the problem nationwide, in communities and workplaces. *Promoting the development and application of protective legislation. *Supporting direct action with (potential) child workers for demonstration purposes, including Time-bound Programmes to address Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention. *Replicating and expanding successful projects into the programmes of partners. *Mainstreaming child labour issues into socio-economic policies, programmes and budgets.

Biography Born in London, he was the eldest son of Michael Waldman OBE JP, a sometime Mayor of Hackney, and was educated at Dame Alice Owen's School, Islington, and Pembroke College, Oxford. Career Waldman began his career as an actor and producer (1935‚Äì1938) before joining the BBC Variety department in 1938. Following wartime service in the Royal Air Force Voluntary Reserve, he became the assistant Head of Variety Productions in 1948. The British public knew him best for his work with Harry S. Pepper as presenter of the popular Monday Night at Eight radio magazine programme, which was broadcast every week live. The programme started in 1937 as \\"Monday Night at Seven\\", becoming \\"Monday Night at Eight\\" soon after the outbreak of the Second World War. It was broadcast throughout the war and continued for several years after it. Waldman's speciality was \\"Puzzle Corner\\", with a \\"deliberate mistake\\" which listeners were invited to spot in time for next week's show. Each week saw a birthday guest star allowed four wishes, and one wish came true, if it could be arranged. After becoming a producer in Television Light Entertainment, in 1950 Waldman rose to be the BBC's Head of Light Entertainment. He launched many of distinguished names in light entertainment, such as Julie Andrews and Morecambe and Wise. Waldman later served as the Business Manager of BBC Television Programmes (1958‚Äì1960), General Manager of BBC Television Enterprises (1960‚Äì1963), Managing Director of Visnews (1963‚Äì1977), President of the Lord's Taverners (1966) and as a trustee of the International Institute of Communications (1975‚Äì1978).

He studied illustration at the Royal College of Art under Edward Bawden and John Nash. He has worked in watercolour, lithography and wood engraving, at scales ranging from platform-length murals for Charing Cross Underground Station in London to postage stamps and logos. His themes include paintings of landscape and environmental posters to drawings of street life and protest placards. He has written and illustrated many books, mostly about countries and cities. He also designed a number of British commemorative postage stamps. Biography Gentleman was born in London and grew up in Hertford, the son of Scottish artists Tom Gentleman and Winifred Gentleman who had met at the Glasgow School of Art. He attended Hertford Grammar School and the St Albans School of Art, did national service as an education sergeant in the Royal Army Education Corps in charge of an art room in Cornwall, and then went to the Royal College of Art. He stayed there as a junior tutor for two years before becoming a freelance artist. He has lived and worked on Gloucester Crescent in Camden Town since 1956, and also in Suffolk, travelling only for work. He has four children: a daughter by his first wife Rosalind Dease, a fellow-student at the RCA, and two daughters and a son by his second wife Susan Evans, the daughter of the writer George Ewart Evans. His and Susan's daughter Amelia, a Guardian journalist, is married to the Conservative politician Jo Johnson. His work is represented in Tate Britain,David Gentleman in the gallery catalogue.

Retrieved 14 May 2010. and the Fitzwilliam Museum.As may be verified via the museum's search facility  Works  = Watercolours and drawings = Gentleman paints and draws landscapes, buildings and people, and uses drawing in his design work. Many of his watercolours have been made in London and Suffolk and around Britain, on extended travels in France, Italy and India, and during briefer spells in South Carolina, East Africa, the Pacific and Brazil. He has held many exhibitions of these works. Commissioned series of watercolours have included landscapes for Shell, several Oxford Almanacks for the Oxford University Press, and interiors of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office for the FCO. His drawings and watercolours have been reproduced on textiles and wallpapers, dinner plates for Wedgwood and on a Covent Garden mug for David Mellor. His architectural drawings have appeared in House & Garden, The Sunday Times, New York Magazine, and on the RIBA's series of Everyday Architecture wallcharts. His most recently published watercolours were made as illustrations for In the Country, 2014. In 2010, Gentleman was commissioned by Dulwich Picture Gallery to create a design for its Christmas Card. = Wood engravings and a mural on the Underground = Detail of Gentleman's mural at Charing Cross tube station Gentleman's early wood engravings were for Penguin paperbacks, greetings cards, wine lists, press ads, and books ‚Äì Swiss Family Robinson and John Clare's The Shepherd's Calendar. He engraved a series of 32 covers for the New Penguin Shakespeare series. His wood engravings appear on many of his stamps, and in a 100-metre- long mural, his most widely seen public work. In 1978, London Transport commissioned the platform-length Eleanor Cross murals on the underground at Charing Cross station. It shows, as in a strip cartoon, how the medieval workforce built the original cross, from quarrying the stone to setting in place the topmost pinnacle. Its wood-engraved images of stonemasons and sculptors, enlarged twenty times to life-size, mirror today's passengers going about their day's work. =Books= Between 1982 and 1997, Gentleman wrote and illustrated six travel books: David Gentleman‚Äôs Britain, London, Coastline, Paris, India and Italy, and more recently London You‚Äôre Beautiful, 2012, In the Country, 2014 and My Town: An Artist‚Äôs Life in London, 2020. He also wrote and illustrated four books about a small child on holiday: Fenella in Ireland, Greece, Spain and the South of France. =Illustration= Gentleman has illustrated many books by other people, including drawings for the cookbook Plats du Jour. In 2009 he painted watercolours to illustrate Ask the Fellows Who Cut the Hay by George Ewart Evans. For the Limited Editions Club of New York City he illustrated The Swiss Family Robinson, Keats's Poems, The Jungle Book, and The Ballad of Robin Hood, and several books for children, including Russell Hoban's The Dancing Tigers. He has designed many paperback covers and jackets: for Penguin Books, E. M. Forster's novels and the New Penguin Shakespeare wood engravings; for Faber, many watercolours for Siegfried Sassoon and Lawrence Durrell novels; and for Duckworth, wood engraved or typographical designs for scientific and classical works. =Stamps, coins and logos= Between 1962 and 2000 Gentleman designed 103 stamps for the Post Office, making him the most prolific stamp designer in Britain at that time.Gentleman on Stamps ‚Äì Unadopted Designs and Issues These include sets for Shakespeare, Churchill, Darwin, British Ships, Concorde, the Battle of Britain, the Battle of Hastings, the BBC, Good King Wenceslas, The Twelve Days of Christmas, Social Reformers, Ely Cathedral, Abbotsbury Swannery and the Millennium. His stamp designs included an album of experimental designs commissioned by Tony Benn, then Postmaster General to show how stamps could dispense with the large photograph of the Queen then mandatory, or alternatively replace it with a smaller profile silhouette derived initially from Mary Gillick's coinage head. More than 40 years later, the wider range of subjects, the profile and the simpler designs that it made possible remain a feature of all British special stamps.Gentleman on Stamps ‚Äì A Revolution in British Stamp Design He won the Phillips Gold Medal for postage stamp design in both 1969 and 1979.\\"News of the World: Top stamp award for David Gentleman\\" in Gibbons Stamp Monthly, Vol. 53, No. 4, September 1979, p. 59. The Royal Mint have issued two of Gentleman's coin designs. The first (issued jointly with the Monnaie de Paris in 2004) celebrated the centenary of the Entente Cordiale, and the second in 2007 commemorated the bicentenary of the Act for the abolition of the slave trade. Other miniature design commissions have included symbols or logos for the Bodleian Library, British Steel and a redesign of the National Trust's familiar symbol of a spray of oak leaves. =Posters= Gentleman has designed posters for public institutions including London Transport (Visitors' London and Victorian London), the Imperial War Museum, and the Public Record Office. A series in the seventies for the National Trust, used unconventional designs, photographs and photo-montages; some won design awards. Later, poster-like designs replaced words in his book A Special Relationship (Faber, 1979) on the US/UK alliance.\\"No longer a Gentleman\\", London Evening Standard, 1979. Gentleman regretted that these images were not displayed as actual posters. On the eve of the Iraq war in 2003, Gentleman offered the Stop the War Coalition a poster saying simply 'No', which was carried on the protest march. Other march placards followed, including 'No more lies' and 'Bliar'. His largest design was an installation in 2007 of 100,000 drops of blood, one for each person already killed in that war. The bloodstains were printed on 1,000 sheets of card pegged out in a vast square covering the grass in Parliament Square. =Lithographs and screenprints= Gentleman's first lithographs were posters for a Royal College of Art theatre group production of Orphee and a student exhibition, and one of his first commissions was for a large Lyons lithograph. Between 1970 and 2008 he made suites of lithographs of buildings (Covent Garden, South Carolina, Bath) and landscapes (of Gordale Scar, of the Seven Sisters, and of Suffolk subjects). These lithographs were printed in colour and were essentially representational. In 1970 he made six more poster-like screenprints, Fortifications, published in New York City. A number of these are in the collections of Tate Britain.

Merchants and traders from ancient Egypt would travel over the Nubian Desert to buy gold, cloth, stone, food, and much more from the ancient civilization of Nubia. The largest city of the Nubian Desert is Port Sudan, located on the eastern end of the desert, on the Red Sea. Other important cities of the Nubian Desert are Atbara on the river of the same name, as well as Massawa on the Red Sea. The town of Abidiya is located on the Nile river. This desert is the only habitat for the critically endangered palm Medemia argun, which only appears rarely in some oases in the desert.List of Threatened Species, IUCN Red List On October 7, 2008 the meteoroid 2008 TC3 exploded above the Nubian Desert.

Early life Porter was born in Shepherd's Bush, London, to bus conductor Richard John Porter and Phoebe Elizabeth (n√©e Spall). His parents hoped he would become an electrical engineer, so he was educated at the Technical College in Wimbledon, then worked for the Marconi Telegraph and Wireless company as a joint-solderer. He made his stage debut at the Cambridge Arts Theatre in 1945 at the age of 17. Career In 1955, Porter played the title role in Ben Jonson's Volpone at the Bristol Old Vic. He won the London Evening Standard award in 1959 for his performance in Ibsen's Rosmersholm at the Royal Court Theatre. In 1960 he joined the Royal Shakespeare Company; that year, he played Ferdinand in John Webster's The Duchess of Malfi. In 1962, he performed as Iachimo in Cymbeline. Other roles included Ulysses, Macbeth, Leontes, Malvolio, Shylock, King Lear and Henry IV, as well as Barabas in Marlowe's Jew of Malta. Porter was seen as the tortured solicitor Soames Forsyte in the BBC drama The Forsyte Saga (1967). The series was a huge international success, and his role, for which he won a BAFTA Best Actor award, also made him a star. Porter's 1981 portrayal of Neville Chamberlain in Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years won critical praise. He played Count Bronowsky in The Jewel in the Crown; he was also seen as Fagin in the 1985 BBC version of Oliver Twist; as Thomas Danforth in the 1980 BBC production of The Crucible; and as Professor Moriarty opposite Jeremy Brett's Sherlock Holmes in Granada Television's The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes stories The Red-Headed League and The Final Problem (both 1984). He also played Polonius in a 1980 television production of Hamlet, made as part of the BBC Shakespeare series, and starring Derek Jacobi in the title role. Porter continued to act on stage, again winning the London Evening Standard Theatre Award for Best Actor in 1988 for his role in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. His last on-screen role was as painter James Player in the remake of Message for Posterity (1994), a television play by Dennis Potter. Personal life As quoted in the 2016 biography Peter O'Toole: The Definitive Biography by Robert Sellers, Susan Engel told the biographer that Eric Porter was gay: \\"His memorable BAFTA Best Actor Award-winning performance as Soames in the BBC's 1967 television adaptation of The Forsyte Saga should have led to greater things, but it didn't. 'He couldn't cope with his own sexuality,' says Susan. 'It was so awful for gay men in those days. I don't know how some of them managed to survive; and many didn't. You went to prison if you were caught. I think he suffered terribly. He was tortured.'\\" In The Telegraph, Ben Lawrence, in an article on the Forsyte Saga, observed that \\"the series made a star of Porter who, according to some sources, was secretly gay and deeply uncomfortable about the attention which The Forsyte Saga foisted on him.\\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/0/edwardian-soap-met-swinging-sixties- forsyte-saga-made-tv-drama/ In 1956 and All that: The Making of Modern British Drama (1999), the dramatist and academic Dan Rebellato includes Porter in a list of \\"gay men... powerful in the British theatre of the forties and fifties\\".1956 and All that: The Making of Modern British Drama, Dan Rebellato, Routledge, 1999, p. 163 The 2017 biography Eric Porter The Life of an Acting Giant, by Porter's \\"friend and chosen biographer\\" Helen Monk, however, indicates that he was \\"previously understood... to be secretly gay\\", and details his relationships with \\"a string of female lovers\\", including \\"the foremost woman in his life for 40 years until his death... glamorous Dutch widow, Therese Megaw\\", Australian artist Alexandra Alderson, and his live-in secretary, Kay, a \\"Judi Dench-lookalike\\", with Monk concluding Porter \\"probably was bisexual\\".https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/life/843158/Eric- Porter-Forsyte-Saga-star-Tortured-love- lifehttps://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/news/nostalgia/acting-great-struck-up- unlikely-481024 Filmography * The Fall of the Roman Empire (1964) - Julianus * The Pumpkin Eater (1964) - Psychiatrist * The Heroes of Telemark (1965) - Josef Terboven * Kaleidoscope (1966) - Harry Dominion * The Forsyte Saga (1967) - Soames Forsyte * The Lost Continent (1968) - Capt.

It is a systemic benzimidazole fungicide that is selectively toxic to microorganisms and invertebrates, especially earthworms, but nontoxic toward mammals. Due to the prevalence of resistance of parasitic fungi to benomyl, it and similar pesticides are of diminished effectiveness. Nonetheless it is widely used. Toxicity Benomyl is of low toxicity to mammals. It has an arbitrary LD50 of \\"greater than 10,000 mg/kg/day for rats\\". Skin irritation may occur through industrial exposure, and florists, mushroom pickers and floriculturists have reported allergic reactions to benomyl. In a laboratory study, dogs fed benomyl in their diets for three months developed no major toxic effects, but did show evidence of altered liver function at the highest dose (150 mg/kg). With longer exposure, more severe liver damage occurred, including cirrhosis. The US Environmental Protection Agency classified benomyl as a possible carcinogen. Carcinogenic studies have produced conflicting results. A two-year experimental study on mice has shown it \\"probably\\" causes an increase in liver tumours. The British Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food took the view this was brought about by the hepatotoxic effect of benomyl. In regards to occupational exposures to benomyl, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration has set a permissible exposure limit of 15 mg/m3 for total exposure over an eight-hour time-weighted average, and 5 mg/m3 for respiratory exposures. =Birth defects= In 1996, a Miami jury awarded US$4 million to a child whose mother was exposed in pregnancy to Benlate. The child was born without eyes (anophthalmia). The mother had been exposed to an unusually high dose of Benlate through her exposure from a near by farm, during pregnancy. An important issue in the case was the timing and magnitude of exposure. In October 2008, DuPont paid confidential settlements to two New Zealand families whose children were born with either anophthalmia or other birth defects. The mother of one of the children had been exposed to Benlate while working as a Christchurch parks worker before his birth. Environmental effects Benomyl binds strongly to soil and does not dissolve in water to any great extent. It has a half-life in turf of three to six months, and in bare soil, a half-life of six months to one year. In 1991, DuPont issued a recall of its Benlate 50DF formula due to suspected contamination with the herbicide atrazine. In the wake of the recall, many US growers blamed Benlate 50DF for destroying millions of dollars' worth of crops. Growers filed over 1,900 damage claims against DuPont, mostly involving ornamental crops in Florida. Subsequent testing by DuPont determined the recalled product was not contaminated with atrazine. The reason for the alleged crop damage is unclear. The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services suggested Benlate was contaminated with dibutylurea and sulfonylurea herbicides. After several years of legal argument, DuPont paid out about US$750 million in damages and out-of-court settlements. By 1993, a coalition of farm worker and environmental groups came together to form \\"Benlate Victims Against DuPont\\", a group which called for a nationwide boycott of DuPont products. After carrying out tests, DuPont denied Benlate was contaminated with dibutylurea and sulfonylureas and stopped compensation pay-outs. In 1995, a Florida judge rejected a complaint from the Florida Department of Agriculture that had alleged such a link. Cellular biology Benomyl is used in molecular biology to study the cell cycle in yeast; in fact, the name of the protein class \\"Bub\\" (Bub1, etc.) comes from their mutant in which budding was uninhibited by benomyl. Benomyl acts by depolymerizing microtubules. Benomyl is also useful in the laboratory because it is selectively toxic to most members of the Ascomycota, whereas members of the Basidiomycota are largely resistant.

It took place on 24 May 1798 after the stationing of the 9th Dragoons, and members of the Tyrone, Antrim and Armagh Militias at Ballymore in County Kildare near the Kildare-Wicklow border on 10 May. The town had been recently garrisoned by almost 200 soldiers and militia who had been sent to repress sedition in the area. The troops had been dispersed in billets among the populace as per counter-insurgency practice of \\"free- quarters\\" where responsibility for the provisioning and sheltering of militia was foisted onto the populace. During this time a quantity of arms were surrendered and letters of protection issued. On 23 May, 120 soldiers were recalled, leaving a garrison of around 40-50 men. At around 1 a.m. on 24 May, the rebel force of approx. 500 attacked the town. As in the attacks on Naas and Prosperous, the rebels sought to surprise and overwhelm the garrison by coordinated attacks before it could react and rally against them. The houses containing troops of the 9th Dragoons and the Tyrone Militia were to be attacked simultaneously. However, the attack on garrison headquarters was miscarried due to lack of coordination and numbers so that the building became a rallying point for the Government troops. Captain Beevor was attacked in his own bedchamber by two rebels. Lieutenant Parkinson and some dragoons came to his aid and both rebels were slain. Other isolated billets were attacked but some units managed to cut themselves free and fight their way through the streets to the headquarters. A number of properties, including the Protestant church, were set on fire. For two hours, the rebels attacked the strongpoint but without artillery, were unable to take the building and lost many men in the process. The momentum had by now slipped away from the rebels, and a decisive counter charge by dragoons routed them leaving behind around 100 dead but at a cost to the garrison of at least 12 dead and 5 wounded. The battle led directly to the Massacre of Dunlavin Green, in which fears of a possible rebel attack on the garrison at nearby Dunlavin led to the mass execution of rebel prisoners.

It is often used together with chloroquine or atovaquone. When used with chloroquine the combination will treat mild chloroquine resistant malaria. It is taken by mouth. Side effects include diarrhea, constipation, skin rashes, hair loss, and itchiness. Because malaria tends to be more severe in pregnancy, the benefit typically outweighs the risk. If used during pregnancy it should be taken with folate. It is likely safe for use during breastfeeding. Proguanil is converted by the liver to its active metabolite, cycloguanil. Proguanil has been studied at least since 1945. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In the United States and Canada it is only available in combination as atovaquone/proguanil. Medical uses Proguanil is used for the prevention and treatment of malaria in both adults and children, particularly in areas where chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum malaria has been reported. It is usually taken in combination with atovaquone, another antimalarial drug. It is also effective in the treatment of most other multi-drug resistant forms of P. falciparum; the success rate exceeds 93%. Side effects Proguanil is generally well tolerated, and most people do not experience side effects. However, common side effects include abdominal pain, nausea, headache, and fever. Taking proguanil with food may lessen these side effects. Proguanil should not be taken by people with severe renal impairment, pregnant women, or women who are breastfeeding children less than 5 kg. There have also been reports of increased levels of liver enzymes, which may remain high for up to 4 weeks after completion of treatment. Mechanism When used alone, proguanil functions as a prodrug. Its active metabolite, cycloguanil, is an inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). Although both mammals and parasites produce DHFR, cycloguanil's inhibitory activity is specific for parasitic DHFR. This enzyme is a critical component of the folic acid cycle. Inhibition of DHFR prevents the parasite from recycling dihydrofolate back to tetrahydrofolate (THF). THF is required for DNA synthesis, amino acid synthesis, and methylation; thus, DHFR inhibition shuts down these processes. Proguanil displays synergism when used in combination with the antimalarial atovaquone. This mechanism of action differs from when proguanil was used as a singular agent. In this case, it is not thought to function as a DHFR inhibitor. The addition of proguanil has shown to reduce resistance to atovaquone and increase the ability of atovaquone to trigger a mitochondrial apoptotic cascade. This is commonly referred to as \\"collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential.\\" Proguanil lowers the effective concentration of atovaquone needed to increase permeability of the mitochondrial membrane.

Plot On a visit to Moe's, Homer has no money to pay for his beer and Moe will not give him any freebies. As a result, he goes around town trying other things to feel drunk, such as breathing thin air on top of a mountain, licking toads and giving blood. Moe feels guilty about refusing to serve Homer and gives him a free beer, but Homer is already heavily intoxicated. Moe, Lenny and Carl put Homer in a taxi to take him home. In the cab he is secretly videotaped for a reality show called Taxicab Conversations, and says some unpleasant things about Marge and the kids, as well as revealing his dream of becoming a rock star. His family is not impressed with him, but soon realize that they do somewhat burden him. To make up for this, the family takes Homer to a Rock 'n Roll Fantasy Camp, run by the Rolling Stones. At the camp, Homer and a bunch of other Springfield citizens learn about rock music, from instructors Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, Elvis Costello, Lenny Kravitz, Tom Petty and Brian Setzer. Finally, the wannabe-rockstars have a mock rock concert, with Homer as the lead guitarist and singer. When Homer learns that the camp is just a one-week only camp, he is bitterly disappointed and refuses to leave. Mick Jagger eventually placates Homer by offering him a chance to perform at a benefit gig, the \\"Concert for Planet Hollywood\\". An excited Homer gets passes for his friends so they can see him at the concert. Homer's glee turns to embarrassment when he is asked to perform the duties of a roadie. When he goes on stage to test the microphone, seeing his family and friends out there rooting for him, he sings a rock song and steals the show. This angers the rock stars, who attempt to run Homer off the stage with a big mobile fire-breathing devil's head. The devil's head goes out of control and plows into the audience. The performers, feeling sorry about their actions, offer Homer an opportunity to perform at another benefit concert (for the victims of the recently messed-up gig), but he declines and prefers to perform at home instead. However, at the end of the episode he replaces his car with the big devil's head (given to him by the band) using it to take Bart and Lisa to school. Principal Skinner tells Homer that he is not allowed to stop his car in the school bus zone. In retaliation, Homer activates the devil's fire breath, burning off Skinner's clothes, much to the delight of the kids. Cultural references The cab videotaping Homer is a parody of Taxicab Confessions. The title of the episode is a play on words, referencing Joe Strummer of The Clash; in something of an unfortunate coincidence, Strummer would succumb to a sudden, fatal heart attack just one month after the episode's original airdate. The couch gag is a visual pun of the slang term \\"jump the shark\\", which describes when a TV show has reached its creative peak and is slowly declining in quality. When the camp is over, Mick Jagger tells Homer to cheer up, \\"it's only rock and roll camp\\", and Homer responds, \\"but I like it.\\" This is in reference to the Rolling Stones song \\"It's Only Rock 'n Roll (But I Like It)\\". The songs include \\"Rip This Joint\\", \\"Start Me Up\\", and \\"She's So Cold\\", all by the Rolling Stones; \\"Are You Gonna Go My Way\\" by Lenny Kravitz; \\"Pump It Up\\" by Elvis Costello; and \\"The Last DJ\\" by Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers. The name of the camp is a reference to Bad Company song \\"Rock 'n' Roll Fantasy\\". The episode title is a reference to a short essay that many children are asked to write upon returning to school after the summer vacation. Reception Mike B. Anderson (pictured) directed the episode. In 2003, Annie Alleman of The Herald News named the episode her all-time favorite Simpsons episode. The same year, writers of Entertainment Weekly listed it as the twenty-second best Simpsons episode of all time. They elaborated that \\"You've gotta admire a show that lands the greatest names in rock and then gives them as much respect as a brown M&M.; [...] While rockers have always shone in 'Simpsons' solos, the Stones so giddily mock their hall- of-fame status it makes \\"Strummer\\" the series' Woodstock: a classic-rock show even Disco Stu could get behind.\\" Robert Canning of IGN in a Flashback Review gave the episode an 8.6 saying it was \\"Great\\" and also stated \\"In a season that I generally see as ho-hum (\\"Pray Anything\\" is the only other episode I rate highly), \\"How I Spent My Strummer Vacation\\" simply rocks\\".Canning, Robert (August 25, 2008) The Simpsons Flashback: \\"How I Spent My Strummer Vacation\\" Review IGN Retrieved May 30, 2010 In 2007, Simon Crerar of The Times listed Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Elvis Costello and Lenny Kravitz's performances among the thirty-three funniest cameos in the history of the show. In 2011, Kravitz revealed that his greatest achievement was the appearance on The Simpsons in the eyes of his young relatives. He explained that \\"To my nieces and nephews appearing on 'The Simpsons' was when I actually made it. All the other stuff doesn't count.\\" New York magazine named the episode one of the top ten later Simpsons episodes.

His most acclaimed paintings are urban landscapes of Manchester, now in the collection of Manchester Art Gallery. Today, he is chiefly remembered as L. S. Lowry's tutor.Mark Brown \\"Exhibition for 'Monet of Manchester' who inspired Lowry\\", The Guardian, 14 October 2011 Life and career Born in Saint-√âtienne in eastern central France, on 13 October 1876, he trained at the Ecole Municipale de Beaux-Arts et des Arts Decoratifs in Bordeaux. Valette arrived in England for unknown reasons in 1904 and studied at the Birkbeck Institute, now part of the University of London. In 1905 he travelled to the North West of England where he designed greetings cards and calendars for a Manchester printing company. He attended evening classes at Manchester Municipal School of Art and in 1907 he was invited to join the staff as a teacher. His French teaching style, painting by demonstration, was new to the United Kingdom. Photograph of Valette (date unknown) Salford painter, L. S. Lowry became a pupil of Valette, expressed great admiration for his tutor, who taught him new techniques and showed him the potential of the urban landscape as a subject. He called him \\"a real teacher ... a dedicated teacher\\" and added: \\"I cannot over-estimate the effect on me of the coming into this drab city of Adolphe Valette, full of French impressionists, aware of everything that was going on in Paris.\\" In 1920 Valette resigned from the Institute owing to ill health. He stayed in Lancashire for eight more years, teaching privately and painting in Manchester and Bolton. In 1928 he returned to Paris, and subsequently moved to Blac√© en Beaujolais where he died in 1942. Valette's paintings are Impressionist, a style that suited the damp fogginess of Manchester. Manchester Art Gallery has a room devoted to him, where the viewer may compare some of his paintings with some of Lowry's, and judge to what extent Lowry's own style was influenced by him and by French Impressionism generally. The Lowry hosted an exhibition of about 100 works by Valette, alongside works by Lowry, between October 2011 and January 2012. It included paintings of Manchester from Manchester Art Gallery and loans from private owners.

Truman in his inaugural address on January 20, 1949. It took its name from the fact that it was the fourth foreign policy objective mentioned in the speech. Background Following World War Two, the United States found itself in a Cold War struggle against the USSR. The Truman administration came up with the idea for a technical assistance program as a means to win the \\"hearts and minds\\" of the developing world after countries from the Middle East, Latin America, Asia and Africa had complained about the emphasis on European aid by the U.S.Thomas G. Paterson. Foreign Aid under Wraps: The Point Four Program. The Wisconsin Magazine of History Vol. 56, No. 2 (Winter, 1972‚Äì1973), pp. 119‚Äì126. Wisconsin Historical Society. By sharing US know-how in various fields, especially agriculture, industry and health, officials could help \\"third world\\" nations on the development path, raise the standard of living, and show that democracy and capitalism could provide for the welfare of the individual. In his inauguration speech on January 20, 1949, President Truman stated the fourth objective of his foreign policy as follows: > \\"we must embark on a bold new program for making the benefits of our > scientific advances and industrial progress available for the improvement > and growth of underdeveloped areas. More than half the people of the world > are living in conditions approaching misery. Their food is inadequate. They > are victims of disease. Their economic life is primitive and stagnant. Their > poverty is a handicap and a threat both to them and to more prosperous > areas. For the first time in history, humanity possesses the knowledge and > skill to relieve suffering of these people. The United States is pre-eminent > among nations in the development of industrial and scientific techniques. > The material resources which we can afford to use for assistance of other > peoples are limited. But our imponderable resources in technical knowledge > are constantly growing and are inexhaustible\\"Text of the Speech in > Department of State Bulletin, January 30, 1949, p. 123 Truman denied that this was a colonial venture to dominate other countries. Rather, he insisted, \\"The old imperialism‚Äîexploitation for foreign profit‚Äîhas no place in our plans. What we envisage is a program of development based on the concepts of democratic fair-dealing. All countries, including our own, will greatly benefit from a constructive program for the better use of the world‚Äôs human and natural resources.\\" This was not a call for economic aid‚Äîon the order of the Marshall Plan but for the US to share its \\"know-how\\" and help nations develop with technical assistance. Point Four was the first global U.S. foreign aid program, yet it drew some inspiration from the nation's wartime Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs (OCIAA), which extended technical assistance to Latin American countries. Nelson Rockefeller, the administrator of the OCIAA, strongly supported the establishment of Point Four in congressional hearings.United States Congress, House of Representatives, Committee on Foreign Affairs, International Technical Cooperation Act of 1949, 81st Congress, 1st Session, Washington: GPO, 1950, pp. 79‚Äì97. http://congressional.proquest.com/congressional/docview/t29.d30.hrg-1949-foa-0013 According to the US Secretary of State Dean Acheson, it was the initiative of the then legal counsel to the president Clark Clifford, who suggested to president Truman to initiate an assistance on a worldwide basis, and to include the issue in his inaugural address.Dean Acheson, Present at the Creation: My Years in the State Department (New York, 1969) p. 265 According to Robert Schlesinger's book, White House Ghosts, it was Benjamin H. Hardy who first came up with the concept. After the suggestion was as good as lost in the foggy miasma of the State Department's bureaucracy, Hardy decided to bring the idea to the attention of Truman aide, George Elsey. Elsey and Clifford went on to herald the abstraction into policy. Hardy eventually left the Department of State and became the new Technical Cooperation Administration's Chief Information Officer.Schlesinger, Robert. White House Ghosts: Presidents and Their Speechwriters. New York: Simon & Schuster, 2008. Print. pp. 60‚Äì63\\"Truman Library ‚Äì Benjamin H. Hardy Papers.\\" Harry S. Truman Library and Museum. Web. http://www.trumanlibrary.org/hstpaper/hardybh.htm Implementation In order to implement the program, on February 9, 1949 a new committee was established within the Department of State, known as the Technical Assistance Group, chaired by Samuel Hayes. The program was approved by Congress on June 5, 1950 in the Foreign Economic Assistance Act, which allotted to the program a budget of $25,000,000 for fiscal year 1950/51.\\"Point Four Program\\" Grolier Encyclopedia of Knowledge, volume 15, (1991), Describing the new program, Truman noted that, \\"Communist propaganda holds that the free nations are incapable of providing a decent standard of living for the millions of people in under-developed areas of the earth. The Point Four program will be one of our principal ways of demonstrating the complete falsity of that charge.\\"\\"Texts of Truman Orders to Implement Point IV Plan,\\" New York Times, Sep. 9, 1950 After Congressional approval on October 27, 1950, the Technical Cooperation Administration (TCA) was established within the Department of State to run the Point Four program and the OCIAA became incorporated into the new organization. Henry G. Bennett was the first TCA administrator from 1950 to 1951. The program was carried out with the countries whose governments concluded bilateral agreements with the US government regarding aid under the program, and the TCA established field missions within those countries, which worked to improve agricultural output and distributed technical know-how on improving the economy in general. The first government to do so was the government of Iran, on October 19, 1950. The Point Four Program was different from other programs in that it was not confined to any specific region; it was extended to countries such as Pakistan, Israel, and Jordan,Robins, Philip. A History of Jordan. Cambridge, U.K.: Cambridge University Press, 2004. Among the first nations to gain extensive technical assistance was India. From 1950-1951 India saw the implementation of a penicillin plantation, an increase in schools and medical research facilities as well as dam construction. In addition to economic assistance India also agreed to maintain a democratic government. U.S. Officials hoped this would prevent India forming alliances with the Soviet Union and China. Republican President Dwight D. Eisenhower discarded the Point Four name in favour of simply referring to it as a 'technical assistance program', and reorganized the TCA into the Foreign Operations Administration; its successor agencies include the International Cooperation Administration and the present-day Agency for International Development. Legacy of the program The Point Four Program was the first US plan designed to improve social, economic and political conditions in 'underdeveloped' nations. It marked the promotion of international development policy to the centre of the U.S. Foreign Policy framework. Although designed to uplift nations, the programmes legacy was one of self-interest as America improved their imports of strategical raw materials, without significantly alleviating the partnered nations of deprivation. The post-war climate and rising threat of communism alongside lack of investment from both congress and American businessmen led to the faltering of the Point Four Program.
