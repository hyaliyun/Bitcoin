It was first published by Prometheus Books in the United States in 1995. The title of the book is a homage to Bertrand Russell's essay, Why I Am Not a Christian, in which Russell criticizes the religion in which he was raised.  Motive, contents and reviews  Outraged over the fatwa and death threats against Salman Rushdie, Ibn Warraq assumes a pseudonym to write what the historian and writer Daniel Pipes called \\"serious and thought- provoking book\\" using a \\"scholarly sledgehammer\\" approach to \\"demolish\\" Islam. Warraq claims the work is his contribution ('my war effort') in the struggle against the kinds of people who would want to murder Rushdie. The author's \\"polemic\\" criticizes Islam's mythology, theology, historic achievements, and current cultural influence. Warraq, drawing largely on previous research, provides what English philosopher Antony Flew called an \\"invaluable compilation\\" of Islam's shortcomings. Flew wrote that the book \\"makes a compelling case\\" that Islam is \\"flatly incompatible\\" with \\"individual rights and liberties of a liberal, democratic, secular state\\". According to Warraq, one either has to believe that the Qur'an is the word of God, or that Muhammad was a liar. Moreover, progress made in modern critical scholarship of the Bible has serious and possibly detrimental consequences for belief in the inerrancy of the Qur'an once it is subjected to the same type of scholarly criticism. Dutch arabist Hans Jansen noted that 'it is remarkable that in this first book, Ibn Warraq makes no distinction at all between 'normal' Islam and Islamic fundamentalism. Both oppose the freedom of expression with all their might.' Jansen wondered whether the criticism of Islam that Warraq, Rushdie and other British‚ÄìIndian writers such as V.S. Naipaul and Arun Shourie displayed was perhaps so 'ruthless' ‚Äì compared to the much milder approach commonly adopted by Judaeo-Christian writers ‚Äì because of vestiges of 'Hindu prejudices', or because these authors felt no inhibition to scrutinise a fellow Abrahamic religion.

Casing hangers must be designed to take the full weight of the casing, and provide a seal between the casing hanger and the spool. Casing Hangers may also be suspended within the wellhead by means of radial distortion of the wellhead bore e.g. the \\"Pos-Grip\\" method.

Background While a student at the City College of New York, Perl joined the Steinmetz Club, the campus branch of the Young Communist League, where he met and befriended Julius Rosenberg, Morton Sobell and Joel Barr. Perl graduated with a degree in engineering in 1939, and in 1940 began working for the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) at their Langley Army Air Base research facility in Hampton, Virginia. In 1944 Perl transferred to the NACA Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory in Cleveland, Ohio. Both jobs provided Perl with access to extensive classified materials. NACA sent Perl to Columbia University to pursue doctoral studies in Physics. While at Columbia, Perl lived in the same Morton Street apartment where Barr and Alfred Sarant had lived.Radosh and Milton, p. 117 Career Following his doctoral work at Columbia, Perl returned to Cleveland to work on a jet propulsion project related to supersonic flight. Perl was nearly given a position with the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission when his connection with Barr and Sarant, suspected Communists, was turned up by a security check. Rosenberg Case  In July 1950, Vivian Glassman, Barr's fianc√©e, visited Perl in Cleveland to give him $2,000, advising him to go to Europe. Unlike Barr and Sarant, Perl decided not to flee the country, perhaps thinking he might be able to salvage his career. ACLU lawyer Raymond L. Wise \\"of 80 Broad Street\\" served as Perl's attorney. =Rosenberg Grand Jury= Perl appeared before the Rosenberg Grand Jury in the summer of 1950, denying any relationship with Julius Rosenberg, Morton Sobell, Max Elitcher, Ann Sidorovich, and Michael Sidorovich. By August 29, 1950, Wise was advising Perl to cooperate. On March 10, 1951, Wise and Perl met with FBI agents; Wise stated that Perl had paid him a \\"substantial fee\\" as retainer.TRIALS: Off Base TIME 1 June 1953. On March 15, 1951, Perl was arrested. In April 1951, FBI advised Wise that they would make no deal with Perl over a plea of perjury. Wise argued that the Government lacked jurisdiction to indict, to no avail. The Government delayed the trial in September 1951 due to Wise's illness. In June 1952, Wise asked for a reduction in bail from twenty to five thousand dollars; the judge reserved the decision. In December 1952, Wise asked for another deferral, as he would be in Florida for the winter; the judge decided to keep to resumption in February 1953. In March 1953, Wise again asked for deferral until after Wise's return from Florida on April 21, 1953, stating that Perl would otherwise ask for adjournment. On March 26, 1953, the Government agreed to resume on May 4, 1953. After his return in late April 1953, Wise \\"stated in strict confidence that he felt Perl should plead guilty and cooperate with Government in giving espionage into.\\" By early May 1953, Wise reported that Perl remained unwilling to cooperate. On May 4, 1953, U.S. Judge Thomas Francis Murphy (government prosecutor in the Hiss Case) referred trial for instant case of perjury to Judge Sylvester J. Ryan of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, to commence on May 19, 1953, with Lloyd McMahon and Robert Martin prosecuting and Raymond L. Wise and Stanley Kanavek defending. =Trial= In court, the Government argued that Perl had knowingly lied that he knew Julius Rosenberg and Morton Sobell when they were all members of the Young Communists League or that he knew Helene Elitcher, Michael Sidorovich, or Anne Sidorvich. Wise argued that Perl did not lie intentionally. Perl could not explain how or whether Vivian Glassman had given him paper with Rosenberg's name on it because Perl had destroyed the paper. He could not explain why Sobell had used him as a job reference. Wise then argued that, earlier, Perl had appeared voluntarily when answering, not as a defendant and not under oath. On May 26, 1953, in his summation, Wise argued that Perl believed his answers true at the time he was answering. For instance, he answered truthfully that he did not \\"know\\" Sobell, as in \\"intimately,\\" not whether he ever knew him at all. As for evidence from Helene Ellitcher, Wise argued that the court could only expect her to corroborate the testimony of her husband, Max Elitcher, a communist and known perjurer. Perl had no motive to perjure himself; Wise asked for acquittal on all four perjury charges. On May 22, 1953, Perl was found guilty on two counts of perjury for lying about his \\"acquaintance and association\\" with Rosenberg and Sobell (and acquitted of two other counts). Perl served two concurrent five-year sentences at the New York House of Detention.

Objective, rules, and general gameplay One player plays the \\"mother\\", \\"father\\" or \\"captain\\". The other players are the \\"children\\" or \\"crewmembers\\". To begin the game, the mother or father stands at one end of a room and turns around facing away, while all the children line up at the other end. The children take turns asking \\"Mother/Father, may I ____?\\" and makes a movement suggestion.https://www.care.com/c/stories/3800/4-mother- may-i-game-alternatives/ For example, one might ask, \\"Mother/Father, may I take five steps forward?\\" The mother/father either replies \\"Yes, you may\\" or \\"No, you may not do that, but you may _____ instead\\" and inserts his/her own suggestion. The players usually move closer to the mother/father but are sometimes led farther away. Even if the mother/father makes an unfavorable suggestion, the child must still perform it. The first of the children to reach the location of the mother/father wins the game. That child then becomes the mother/father himself, the original mother/father becomes a child, and a new round begins. Some suggestions that fill in the \\"Mother/Father/Captain, may I ____?\\" blank include: * Take (#) steps forward * Take (#) giant steps forward (usually a small number, due to large step size) * Take (#) baby steps forward (usually a large number, due to tiny step size) * Take (#) umbrella steps forward * Hop forward like a frog, (#) times * Run forward for (#) seconds * Crabwalk forward for (#) seconds * Take (#) Cinderella steps - Twirl forward with index finger touching the top of the head * Open-and-shut the book (#) times - jump forwards with feet apart then again bringing the feet together * Lamppost - lie face down and stretch arms forwards, bring your feet to the point reached by the fingertips If the \\"children\\" are reaching the \\"mother\\" or \\"father\\" too quickly, the \\"mother\\"/\\"father\\" may reject the child's suggestion by replacing it with \\"No, you may not do that, but you may ____ instead.\\" They may reduce the child's original suggestion (for example, reducing five giant steps to three giant steps), or make a different suggestion, such as: * Take (#) steps backward * Run backward for (#) seconds * Walk backward until I (mother/father) say \\"stop\\" * Return to the starting line (in rare cases) A common alternative gameplay is for \\"mother\\" or \\"father\\" (who can be facing the children) to begin each child's turn by issuing the instruction to be carried out. The child must reply, \\"Mother/Father, may I?\\" before carrying out the order, to which Mother/Father always consents. However, if the child omits to ask permission he or she is required to go back to the start. Children who have advanced a long way towards the goal are thus brought to ruin; instructions to go backwards must also be asked for lest a worse fate awaits. The art to being a good mother or father is to bring everyone as equally as possible. Other variations of this kind of crossing- over game are \\"What's the Time, Mr Wolf?\\" (sometimes called \\"Old Mrs. Fox, What Time is It?\\", although this version is slightly different), \\"Grandmother's Footsteps\\" and \\"Bulldog\\", played in Britain. In the first of these, gameplay is similar: Mr Wolf faces away from the children (or Mrs. Fox faces the children), the children together chant in a well-known fashion \\"What's the time, Mr Wolf?\\" (or \\"Old Mrs. Fox, what time is it?\\"), and if he or she replies with 9 o'clock, the children move 9 steps forward. Should anyone reach Mr Wolf, he or she becomes the new Mr Wolf. Alternatively, however, should Mr Wolf reply to the question by saying \\"Dinner Time!\\" (or in the Mrs. Fox version, \\"Midnight!\\") he turns and chases the children back towards the start. If he catches one before he or she reaches safety, that child is the new Mr Wolf.

Because of his close friendship with Morton Sobell and Julius Rosenberg, as well as his damaging testimony, Max Elitcher was the most injurious prosecution witness in the Rosenberg case. Elitcher and Sobell became friends while attending Stuyvesant High School together.http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/rosenb/ROS_BELI.HTM The two men attended the City College of New York where they met Julius Rosenberg. Following graduation, where Elitcher received a degree in engineering, he and Sobell moved to Washington to become junior engineers at the Navy Bureau of Ordnance. The two remained close friends and even shared an apartment together. In 1948, Elitcher left government service to take a job at Reeves Instrument Corporation. Elitcher and his wife moved into a house in Queens. Their backyard neighbors were the Sobells. Elitcher maintained that Julius Rosenberg had attempted to recruit him as a spy during the years 1944-1948. Although Elitcher shared many of Rosenberg's and Sobell's political beliefs, he claimed to have never passed secret information to either. Elitcher testified that he accompanied Sobell to Catherine Slip in New York, where Sobell passed film to Julius Rosenberg. According to the authors of Invitation to an Inquest (1983): \\"At the trial, Elitcher had to be led frequently by Saypol as he told a story that was vague and improbable. He claimed that Rosenberg and also Sobell had on a number of occasions invited him to engage in espionage activities and that they had continued these requests sporadically over a four-year period - despite the fact that he never had turned over a single scrap of information to them.\\" Walter Schneir and Miriam Schneir, Invitation to an Inquest (1983) page 326 The New York Daily News reported: \\"Elitcher left trial observers with the impression that his must have been a masterpiece of equivocation and temporizing, since the first pressure was put to him in 1944... He was still resisting suggestions from Sobell and Rosenberg, he asserted... in 1948.\\" New York Daily News (9 March 1951) The only evidence against Morton Sobell was Elitcher's story about the visit to see Julius Rosenberg in July 1948, when he was living in Knickerbocker Village. He described the \\"35-millimeter film can\\" that Sobell was carrying but he admitted that he did not know what, if anything, the can contained, nor had he actually seen Sobell deliver it to Rosenberg. Elitcher was unable to say if Sobell gave Rosenberg any information that was secret.http://spartacus-educational.com/Max_Elitcher.htm In 2008, Sobell publicly admitted to spying.

By Eero J√§rnefelt, now in the Finnish National Gallery Svedjebruk is a Swedish and Norwegian term for slash-and-burn agriculture that is derived from the Old Norse word svi√∞a which means \\"to burn\\". This practice originated in Russia in the region of Novgorod and was widespread in Finland and Eastern Sweden during the Medieval period. It spread to western Sweden in the 16th Century when Finnish settlers were encouraged to migrate there by King Gustav Vasa to help clear the dense forests. Later, when the Finns were persecuted by the local Swedes, svedjebruk farming was spread by refugees to Eastern Norway in the Eastern part of Sol√∏r, in the area bordering Sweden known as Finnskogen (\\"the Finnish woods\\"). The practice also spread to New Sweden in North America. Reinforced by the use of fire in agriculture and hunting by Native Americans, it became an important part of pioneering in America (Pyne, 1997:470). Description of process Svedjebruk involved stripping a ring of bark completely around the trunk of coniferous trees like pine or spruce or felling them, allowing them to dry, setting fire to the dried forest and growing crops on the fertile ash-covered soil. The resulting ash was highly fertile, but only for a short period. The clearing was initially planted to rye as soon as the ash had fully settled and sufficiently cooled. When the rain came, it packed the ash around the rye. The rye germinated & grew prolifically, with anywhere from 25 to 100 stalks (or straws), each with multiple grains. Only two tools were required, the axe and the sickle. The axe cut the trees to start the cycle. When the rye had ripened, it was harvested with a sickle, which could reach among the rocks and stumps where a scythe would have been ineffective. In the second and third year the field would be sown with turnips or cabbages. It then might be grazed for several years before being allowed to return to woodland.  Svedjebruk culture Svedjebruk required felling new forest and burning a new area every year. It was necessary to allow the former fields to regrow with forest for 10‚Äì30 years before repeating the cycle. As a result, the dwellings were often many kilometers from the fields. Further, since the process was man-power intensive, extended families tended to work together and live in compact communities. The svedjebruk farming approach requires a large area. When forest was plentiful, the Finns were very prosperous. As population grew and restrictions were placed on the forest which could be burned, it became increasingly difficult. By 1710, during the conflict with Sweden, because of their suspect loyalties Norwegian authorities considered expelling them from the border area but did not do so because it was judged they were too poor to survive if evicted.

The group was an early practitioner of heavy metal and progressive rock; they also incorporated elements of jazz and fusion into their music, especially in their fourth album Banquet of 1974. Beyond heavy metal, the band has been cited, too, as one of the pioneers of doom metal, helping to define both genres due to their heavy sound and dark oriented lyrics of their debut Lucifer's Friend of 1970,Christe (2003), pg. 345, \\"Beginning with the overlooked Lucifer's Friend and Necromandus in the early 1970s, doom crawled through the 1980s with Trouble, Witchfinder General, the Obsessed, Candlemass, Pentagram, and Saint Vitus, then into the 1990s with Cathedral, Sleep, and Burning Witch.\\" and returning to their roots in 1981 with Mean Machine, although more influenced by speed metal. History Vocalist John Lawton's band Stonewall broke up while on tour in Germany in 1969. While the band returned home to Britain, Lawton elected to stay in Germany for the time being, and there he met Peter Hesslein, Dieter Horns, Peter Hecht and Joachim Reitenbach, all members of a band called The German Bonds. The five joined together to record an album under the band name Asterix in 1970, soon changing their name to Lucifer's Friend. The early albums were released on the Vertigo Records label in Europe, but in the United States those albums were released on a series of small independent record labels (Billingsgate, Janus, Passport), often a year or more after their release in Europe. Thus, despite airplay in some markets and a cult following, the band's albums were hard to find and commercial success eluded them. The band was finally signed to Elektra Records in 1977: it released three albums with a more commercial pop oriented sound, but by then interest in the band had waned; those albums were even less successful than the earlier ones. Lucifer's Friend was known for changing musical styles and influences on each album. The self-titled 1970 debut had dark lyrics and a stripped-down guitar and organ style and sounded similar to Deep Purple, Uriah Heep, Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath . That album is still sought after by fans of early heavy metal music. The second album, Where the Groupies Killed the Blues (1972), took an entirely different direction. It was a very experimental album of progressive and psychedelic rock, mostly composed by John O'Brien Docker. On the third album, I'm Just a Rock & Roll Singer (1973), they changed direction again, this time in the straightforward rock style popularized by such groups as Grand Funk Railroad, and gritty \\"life on the road\\" themes in the lyrics. Banquet (1974) featured extended, multi-layered jazz fusion compositions and a 30-piece backup band, alternating with some shorter tracks reminiscent of Chicago and Traffic. Those first four albums are all concept albums of a sort and along with the self-titled Asterix album are the most sought after today. Mind Exploding (1976) established a holding pattern and tried to combine the jazz of Banquet with the garage-rock of Rock & Roll Singer, but was not as well received as the earlier albums. Vocalist John Lawton left in 1976 to join Uriah Heep. He was replaced by Ian Cussick. With him the band recorded and released 7\\" single \\"Old Man Roller / Writing On The Wall\\" in June 1977. Later same year he was replaced by Mike Starrs, former vocalist with Colosseum II. John Lawton returned for the 1981 album Mean Machine. On the two albums without Lawton the band moved to a more commercial sound, on 1978's Good Time Warrior and 1980s Sneak Me In. John Lawton's 1980 solo album on RCA, Heartbeat, was a Lucifer's Friend album in everything but name, with the lineup from Sneak Me In performing as backup musicians on that project. Lawton's official return, Mean Machine, found the band returning to heavy metal, this time in the vein of Rainbow and NWOBHM. The band officially broke up in 1982 but thirteen years later, in 1994 John and Peter Hesslein briefly reformed to release a new CD, Sumo Grip under the name of Lucifer's Friend II, with Curt Cress, Andreas Dicke, Jogi Wichmann and Udo Dahmen replacing the classic line-up. After this they broke up once more. =Recent years= Although John Lawton stated that the crew weren't interested in getting back to record or perform live again, in August 2014 he published the news in his website of an eventual reunion with the original line-up to play some dates of 2015 including Sweden Rock Festival in June, after almost 40 years since their last gig together. Also they will release a new compilation album called Awakening on April 6, followed by four new tracks. Due to the demise of their original drummer Joachim \\"Addi\\" Rietenbach a few years ago, his position is now occupied by Stephan Eggert. Also, the original keyboardist Peter Hecht refused to participate in the reunion. Due to this, the guitarist Peter Hesslein played the keyboard parts on the new album, hiring once again Jogi Wichmann (who played on Sumo Grip) as the live keyboardist for the shows in 2015 and 2016. The Lucifer's Friend song \\"Ride in the Sky\\" is played in the Bulgarian film Love.net, starring Lawton, as a song by a fictional band called Tabloid. =Legacy= Tim Baker, lead singer of the doom metal band Cirith Ungol, cited Lucifer's Friend as an influence on Cirith Ungol's sound in an interview with Metal Forces, stating that \\"We really wanted to be like [Lucifer's Friend]\\".

In 1945, she defected from the Communist Party and Soviet intelligence by contacting the FBI and reporting on her activities. She became widely known after testifying in some trials and before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). In 1952 Bentley became an informer for the U.S., as she was paid by the FBI for her frequent appearances before different committees and investigations. She exposed two networks of spies, ultimately naming more than 80 Americans who, she said, had engaged in espionage. Early life Elizabeth TerrillLauren Kessler's 2003 biography spells Bentley's middle name as 'Turrill'. Bentley was born in New Milford, Connecticut, to Charles Prentiss Bentley, a dry-goods merchant, and the former May Charlotte Turrill, a schoolteacher. In 1915 her parents had moved to Ithaca, New York. By 1920, the family had moved to McKeesport, Pennsylvania, and that year they returned to New York, settling in Rochester. Her parents were described as a strait-laced \\"old family\\" of Episcopalians from New England. She attended Vassar College, graduating in 1930 with a degree in English, Italian, and French. In 1933, while she was attending graduate school at Columbia University, she won a fellowship to the University of Florence. While in Italy, she briefly joined a local student fascist group, the Gruppo Universitario Fascista. Under the influence of her anti-Fascist faculty advisor Mario Casella, with whom she had an affair while at Columbia, Bentley soon shifted her politics. While completing her master's degree, she attended meetings of the American League Against War and Fascism. Although she would later say that she found Communist literature unreadable and \\"dry as dust,\\" she was attracted to the sense of community and social conscience she found among her friends in the league. When she learned that most were members of the Communist Party of the United States (CPUSA), she joined the party herself in March 1935. Espionage activity Bentley initiated her entry into espionage. In 1935, she obtained a job at the Italian Library of Information in New York City; this was fascist Italy's propaganda bureau in the United States. She reported the job to CPUSA headquarters, telling them of her willingness to spy on the fascists. Juliet Stuart Poyntz, who also worked at the Italian Library of Information, approached and recruited Bentley. The Communists were interested in the information Bentley could provide, and NKVD officer Jacob Golos was assigned in 1938 to be her contact and controller. Golos (born Yakov Naumovich Reizen) was an immigrant from Russia, who became a naturalized United States citizen in 1915. At this point, Bentley thought she was spying solely for the American Communist Party. But Golos was one of the Soviet Union's most important intelligence agents in the United States. At the time when he and Bentley met, Golos was involved in planning the assassination of Leon Trotsky, which would take place in Mexico in 1940. Bentley and Golos soon became lovers. It was more than a year before she learned his true name, and, according to her later testimony, two years before she knew that he was working for Soviet intelligence. In 1940, two years into their relationship, the Justice Department forced Golos to register as an agent of the Soviet government under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. This increased his risk in contacting the network of American spies he controlled, and accepting documents from them. He gradually transferred this responsibility to Bentley. Golos also needed someone to take charge of the day-to-day business of the United States Service and Shipping Corporation, a Comintern front organization for espionage activities. Bentley took on this role as well. Although she was never directly paid for any of her espionage work, she would eventually earn $800 a month as vice president of U.S. Service and Shipping, a considerable salary for the time, (per month). As Bentley acquired an important role in Soviet intelligence, the Soviets gave her the code name Umnitsa, loosely translated as \\"Wise girl\\". (In some literature it is less correctly translated as \\"good girl\\".) =Silvermaster group= Most of Bentley's contacts were in what prosecutors and historians would later call the \\"Silvermaster group\\", a network of spies centered around Nathan Gregory Silvermaster. This network became one of the most important Soviet espionage operations in the United States. Silvermaster worked with the Resettlement Administration and later with the Board of Economic Warfare. He did not have access to much sensitive information, but he knew several Communists and sympathizers within the government who were better placed and willing to pass such information to him. Using Elizabeth Bentley, he sent it to Moscow. At this time, the Soviet Union and the United States were allies in the Second World War, and much of the information Silvermaster collected for the Soviets had to do with the war against Nazi Germany. As the Soviets were absorbing all of the burden of the ground war in Europe, at a frightful cost in terms of people and materi√®l, they were interested in US intelligence: It included secret estimates of German military strength, data on U.S. munitions production, and information on the Allies' schedule for opening a second front in Europe. The contacts in Golos's and Bentley's extended network ranged from dedicated Stalinists to, in the words of Bentley's biographer Kathryn Olmsted, \\"romantic idealists\\" who \\"wanted to help the brave Russians beat the Nazi war machine\\". =Conflicts with Soviet spymasters= Late in 1943, Jacob Golos suffered a fatal heart attack. After meeting with CPUSA General Secretary Earl Browder, Bentley decided to continue her espionage work and accepted Golos's place. Her new contact in Soviet intelligence was Iskhak Akhmerov, the leading NKGB Illegal Rezident, or undercover spy chief working without a diplomatic cover. Under orders from Moscow, Akhmerov wanted to have Bentley's contacts report directly to him. Bentley, Browder and Golos had resisted this change, believing that using an American intermediary was the best way to handle their sources, and fearing that Russian agents would endanger the American spies and possibly drive them away. With Browder's support, Bentley initially ignored a series of orders that she \\"hand over\\" her agents to Akhmerov. She expanded her spy network when Browder gave her control over another group of agents. This was the \\"Perlo group\\", with contacts in the War Production Board, the United States Senate, and the Treasury Department. Bentley had been noted since her days in Florence as suffering from bouts of depression and having a problem with alcohol. Now, despondent and lonely after the death of Golos and under increasing pressure from Soviet intelligence, she began to drink more heavily. She missed work at U.S. Service and Shipping, and neighbors described her as drinking \\"all the time\\". In early June 1944, Browder acceded to Akhmerov's demands and agreed to instruct the members of the Silvermaster group to report directly to the NKGB. Bentley later said that this was the event that turned her against Communism in the United States. \\"I discovered then that Earl Browder was just a puppet, that somebody pulled the strings in Moscow,\\" she would say.Grand jury testimony in United States of America vs. Alger Hiss, quoted in Her biographers suggest that Bentley's objections, rather than being ideological, were related more to a lifelong dislike of being given orders and a sense that the reassignments of her contacts left her with no meaningful role., Late in 1944, Bentley was ordered to give up all of her remaining sources, including the Perlo group she had recently acquired. Her Soviet superior also told her that she would have to leave her position as vice president of U.S. Service and Shipping. =Break with Soviets= In 1945 Bentley began an affair with a man whom she came to suspect to be either an FBI or a Soviet agent sent to spy on her. Her Soviet contact suggested that she should emigrate to the Soviet Union, but Bentley feared this might end with her execution there. In August 1945, Bentley went to the FBI office in New Haven, Connecticut and met with the agent-in-charge. She did not immediately defect. She seemed to be \\"feeling out\\" the FBI, and it was not until November that she began to tell her full story to the agency. In the meantime, her personal situation continued to worsen. In September she met with Anatoly Gorsky, her latest NKGB controller, and was recorded as arriving drunk to the meeting. She became angry with Gorsky, berated him and his fellow Russian agents as \\"gangsters\\", and obliquely threatened to become an informer. She soon realized that her tirade could have put her life in danger. When Gorsky reported on this to Moscow, his recommendation was to \\"get rid of her\\". Moscow advised Gorsky to be patient with Bentley and calm her down. A few weeks later it was revealed that Louis Budenz, editor of the CPUSA newspaper and one of Bentley's sources, had defected to the United States. Budenz had not yet revealed any of his knowledge of espionage activity, but he knew Elizabeth Bentley's name and knew she was a spy. Imperiled on both sides, Bentley made her final decision to defect and went back to the FBI on November 6, 1945. Defection and after In a series of debriefing interviews with the FBI beginning November 7, 1945, Bentley implicated nearly 150 people in spying for the Soviet Union,Knight, Amy W. (2006) How the Cold War Began: The Igor Gouzenko Affair and the Hunt for Soviet Spies. Carroll & Graf. p. 93. including 37 federal employees. The FBI already suspected many of those she named, and some had been named by earlier defectors Igor Gouzenko and Whittaker Chambers. This increased FBI confidence in her account and person. They gave her the code name \\"Gregory,\\" and J. Edgar Hoover ordered the strictest secrecy measures be taken to hide her identity and defection. Hoover advised Sir William Stephenson, head of British Security Coordination for the Western hemisphere, of Bentley's defection, and Stephenson duly notified London. But Kim Philby was the head of the British Secret Intelligence Service's (SIS or \\"MI6\\") new Section IX (counter-espionage against the Soviet Union). He was a Soviet double agent who would escape to the Soviet Union in 1963. Philby promptly alerted Moscow about Bentley, and they shut down all contact with Bentley's network, just as the FBI was beginning surveillance of them. Bentley's NKGB contact Gorsky again recommended to Moscow that the American be \\"liquidated\\", and again Moscow rejected the idea. The breach of secrecy around Bentley's defection foiled a year-long attempt by the FBI to have her act as a double agent. Additionally, because of the shutdown of Soviet espionage activity, the FBI surveillance of the agents Bentley had named turned up no evidence that could be used to prosecute them. Some 250 FBI agents were assigned to the Bentley case, following up the leads she had provided and, through phone tap, surveillance and mail openings, investigating people she had named. The FBI, grand juries and congressional committees would eventually interview many of these alleged spies, but each of them would either invoke their Fifth Amendment right not to testify or maintain their innocence. For J. Edgar Hoover and a few highly placed FBI and army intelligence personnel, the definitive corroboration of Bentley's story came some time in the late 1940s to early 1950s, when the highly secret Venona project succeeded in decrypting some wartime cables sent between Soviet intelligence agents and Moscow. In these cables, Bentley was referred to by the codename which she had told the FBI, and there were discussions of several of her known contacts and documents which she was known to have passed on to the Soviets. The Venona project was classified and was considered so secret that the US Government was unwilling to expose it by allowing any material from it to be used as evidence in any trial. Neither presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt nor Harry Truman were aware of the Venona project by name, though they received some of its conclusions as summarized by J. Edgar Hoover in weekly intelligence reports. =Public testimony= Press photos of Bentley during her testimony With the chances of successful prosecution looking unlikely, Hoover gave the names of some of Bentley's contacts to certain U.S. Congressmen, with the understanding that the accused spies would be questioned before congressional committees. He believed that the publicized suspicion and accusations would be sufficient to ruin their careers. Additionally, Attorney General Tom C. Clark decided to present the Bentley case to a grand jury, although he thought there was little chance they would be able to return any indictments. Bentley testified before this grand jury on several occasions, lasting until April 1948. During this period, some details of her case began to leak to the press. Bentley decided to reveal her full story herself, to exert more control. She met with Nelson Frank and Norton Mockridge, journalists from the New York World-Telegram. During four consecutive days, the newspaper published a series of front-page stories about the unnamed \\"beautiful young blonde\\" who had exposed a ring of spies. The articles were: * \\"Red Ring Bared by Blond Queen\\" (July 21, 1948) * \\"Super-Secrecy Veiled Russia's Spy Cells Here\\" (July 22, 1948) * \\"Citizens Tricked into Spy Ring by U.S. Reds\\" (July 23, 1948) * \\"Commie Chieftains Ordered Budenz to Aid Red Spy Queen\\" (July 26, 1948) Almost immediately following the World-Telegram articles, Bentley was subpoenaed to testify at a public hearing of the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) on July 31, 1948, (see hearing transcript ). According to Olmsted's biography, reporters' accounts and analyses of Bentley's testimony varied with their politics. The strongly anti- communist New York Journal-American described Bentley as a \\"shapely\\" \\"blonde and blue-eyed New Yorker\\" who \\"lured\\" secrets from her sources, while A. J. Liebling of The New Yorker ridiculed her story and called her the \\"Nutmeg Mata Hari.\\" For her part, Bentley portrayed herself as na√Øve and innocent, corrupted by her liberal professors at Vassar and seduced into espionage by Golos. Starting on August 3, 1948, during additional HUAC hearings, Bentley received some corroboration from Whittaker Chambers. Under subpoena by HUAC, he testified that he knew at least two of Bentley's contacts, Victor Perlo and Charles Kramer, as communists and members of his earlier Ware Group. He also supported her accusation that Harry Dexter White, a prominent economist who had worked in the Treasury Department, was a communist sympathizer. Comparing their testimony, Chambers wrote in his memoir: > I knew that I was simply back-stopping Miss Bentley, that hers was the > current testimony. The things that I had to tell were ten years old and I > had only to let the shadows, dust and cobwebs conspicuously drape them to > leave the stand unscathed. Many reporters and commentators were skeptical about Bentley's claims. Since some of those she accused were prominent figures in two Democratic administrations, Democrats in particular were eager to have her discredited. President Truman at one point characterized her testimony as a Republican- inspired \\"red herring.\\" Republicans, in turn, accused Truman of \\"covering up\\" communist espionage. Conflicts of this nature, along with fears of Soviet communist power in Europe and the increasingly publicized hearings of HUAC, were the background to the rise of McCarthyism. The witch hunt for communists initiated by Senator Joseph McCarthy (R-Wisconsin) became a central factor in domestic American politics in the 1950s. =Meet the Press= Bentley in 1948 On August 6, 1948, Bentley appeared on NBC Radio's Meet the Press, broadcast at 10 p.m. via WOR. On Sunday, September 12, 1948, she appeared on the first- ever television broadcast of NBC's Meet the Press, via WNBT, and was the first person interviewed. Journalists included: Nelson Frank, Inez Robb, Cecil Brown, and Lawrence Spivak. Brown asked her three times whether she would accuse William Remington of being a communist, outside of congressional protection, and she finally did so. When he was called before a Truman Loyalty Review Board, Joseph L. Rauh Jr. defended him. His attorney Richard Green asked on Remington's behalf for Bentley to withdraw the allegations by September 30. When she did not, Green filed a libel suit on October 6, 1948 against Bentley, NBC, and its television sponsor General Foods Corporation, seeking $100,000 in damages. Bentley failed to appear in court in October. On December 29, 1948, Green said he had personally served a summons on her. (The same day, judges and lawyers agreed to suspend Alger Hiss's libel suit against Whittaker Chambers because of Department of Justice indictments of Hiss on two counts of perjury two weeks before). =Trials and credibility= Most of the people accused by Bentley invoked the Fifth Amendment and refused to answer her charges. A few, however, specifically denied them. Most notable of these was Harry Dexter White. He was already suffering from known heart disease; he died of a heart attack a few days after his testimony before HUAC. Others who denied Bentley's charges were Lauchlin Currie, formerly President Roosevelt's economic affairs advisor; William Remington and William Henry Taylor, both midlevel government economists; Duncan Lee, formerly with the Office of Strategic Services (OSS); and Abe Brothman, a private-sector chemist who worked on defense projects. As noted above, in October 1948, William Remington sued Bentley and NBC for libel. In hopes of discrediting her, Remington's attorneys hired private detectives to look into her past. They produced evidence of her alcoholism, periods of severe depression, and a suicide attempt while a student in Florence; they alleged that her master's thesis had been written by someone else, and that, by the standards of the day, she had been sexually promiscuous since her college days. Bentley declined to testify at a Remington loyalty board hearing, and NBC settled the libel case out of court for $10,000. Bentley testified in the trials of four accused spies: The perjury trial of William Remington, a case against Abe Brothman for obstruction of justice, and Julius and Ethel Rosenberg trials on charges of conspiracy to commit espionage. Bentley was peripherally involved in the Rosenberg case. She was used by the prosecution to develop two points: first, the actions of American Communists in becoming spies for the Soviet Union; and second, to establish, if only vaguely in the jury's mind, a connection between Julius Rosenberg and Golos. She testified that she would receive calls from a man who identified himself as Julius, after which Golos would go out to meet him. After defecting to US authorities, Bentley's personal life became increasingly tumultuous. She continued to drink heavily, was involved in car accidents, and had a relationship with a man who beat her severely. She avoided subpoenas on a number of occasions. These incidents, along with generally erratic behavior, resulted in her FBI handlers worrying that she was \\"bordering on some mental pitfall\\". But she was invariably calm and professional on the witness stand, earning praise from the prosecutors whose cases she was supporting. As Bentley repeatedly testified before grand juries, congressional committees and jury trials, however, she refined and embellished some details of her story. Information passed to her about a process for manufacturing synthetic rubber that was originally \\"vague\\" and \\"probably of no value\\" became \\"super-secret\\" and \\"an extremely complicated thing.\\" She would also assert that her espionage gave her advance notice of the Doolittle raid on Japan and the D-Day invasions of France, both claims that appeared to have been exaggerated. William Remington Remington's first trial began in late December 1950. Roy Cohn, later to become famous as chief counsel for Senator Joseph McCarthy‚Äôs Government Operations Subcommittee and already a noted anti-communist, joined the prosecution's legal team. Bentley later supplied a wealth of detail about Remington's involvement with her and the espionage conspiracy. Remington's defense was that he had never handled any classified material, hence could not have given any to Bentley. But she remembered all the facts about the rubber-from-garbage invention: > \\"We had searched through the archives and discovered the files on the > process. We also found the aircraft schedules, which were set up exactly as > she said, and inter office memos and tables of personnel which proved > Remington had access to both these items. We also discovered Remington's > application for a naval commission in which he specifically pointed out that > he was, in his present position with the Commerce Department, entrusted with > secret military information involving airplanes, armaments, radar, and the > Manhattan Project (the atomic bomb).\\" Cohn, Roy (1968) McCarthy. New > American Library. p. 38. During the trial eleven witnesses claimed they knew Remington to be a communist. This included Bentley; ex-wife Ann Remington; Professor Howard Bridgeman of Tufts University; Kenneth McConnell, a Communist organizer in Knoxville; Rudolph Bertram and Christine Benson, who worked with him at the Tennessee Valley Authority; and Paul Crouch, who provided him with copies of the southern edition of the communist newspaper, The Daily Worker.William Remington  Occupation currency plates  Bentley also testified that Harry Dexter White was responsible for passing Treasury plates for printing Allied currency in Occupied Germany to the Soviet Union, which used them to print millions of marks. Russian soldiers exchanged these marks for goods and hard currency. They were catalysts for a black market and serious inflation throughout the occupied country, and costing the U.S. a quarter of a billion dollars. Bentley wrote in her autobiography Out of Bondage (1951) that she had been \\"able through Harry Dexter White to arrange that the United States Treasury Department turn the actual printing plates over to the Russians.\\" In her 1953 testimony before McCarthy's Senate subcommittee, she elaborated, testifying that she was following instructions from NKVD New York rezident Iskhak Abdulovich Akhmerov to pass word through Ludwig Ullmann and Nathan Gregory Silvermaster for White to \\"put the pressure on for the delivery of the plates to Russia.\\"\\"Testimony of Elizabeth Bentley,\\" S. Prt. 107-84 ‚Äì Executive Sessions of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Committee on Government Operations (McCarthy Hearings 1953‚Äì54), Vol. 4, p. 3427 Bentley had not previously mentioned the printing plates in any earlier debriefings or testimony. There was no evidence at the time that she had any role in the transfer of the plates. Bentley biographer Kathryn Olmsted concluded that Bentley was \\"lying about her role in the scandal\\". She cited historian Bruce Craig's conclusion \\"that the whole 'scheme' was a complete fabrication\\"; i.e., that neither Bentley nor Harry Dexter White had a role in the plate transfer. After Olmsted's 2002 biography was published, a memorandum found in the newly accessible Soviet archives and also published in 2002, corroborated Bentley's testimony in this matter. In it, Gaik Ovakimian, head of the American desk of the NKVD, cites an April 14, 1944 report reporting that, \\"following our instructions\\" via Silvermaster, White had \\"attained the positive decision of the Treasury Department to provide the Soviet side with the plates for engraving German occupation marks.\\" Since Bentley was the Soviets' contact to Silvermaster at this time, her involvement in this incident is substantiated.  Paid informer (1952)  After her defection, Bentley was frequently asked to provide testimony before various bodies investigating communist espionage and influence in the US. She continued occasional consultations with the FBI for the rest of her life. In 1952, she began accepting payments for times when she testified, making her a \\"paid informer\\" for the FBI. Biographer Olmsted writes that she received frequent requests from Catholic and veteran groups \\"happy to pay her $300 fee.\\"  Conversion and Speaking Circuit  Though she had been a successful executive with a profitable shipping company while she was with the Communists, she changed fields after her defection. First she supported herself through secretarial work and then through a variety of teaching jobs. In 1948 she was converted to Roman Catholicism by Fr. Fulton Sheen, later Auxiliary Bishop of New York. She was frequently invited to lecture on Communism, and her experience of the Communist movement, by Catholic groups. Death Bentley died on December 3, 1963, aged 55, from abdominal cancer at Grace-New Haven Hospital in New Haven, Connecticut. Obituaries were published in The New York Times and The Washington Post. Olmsted notes in Bentley's biography the marked contrast between the notice paid to Bentley's death and that of Whittaker Chambers two years earlier. The National Review devoted a special memorial issue to Chambers' death. It allotted only a paragraph to Bentley. Time magazine had devoted two pages to its Chambers obituary, but gave Bentley's death a two-sentence mention in its \\"Milestones\\" section. Legacy Although Bentley did not name Whittaker Chambers in her late July 1948 testimony, Robert E. Stripling said her testimony had made him \\"think of Chambers.\\" He had him subpoenaed and Chambers appeared only a few days after Bentley, thus launching the Hiss Case. In sum, Bentley exposed two networks of spies, ultimately naming more than 80 Americans who had engaged in espionage for the Soviets. Her public testimony, which began in July 1948, became a media sensation and had a major effect on prosecution of cases of Soviet espionage in the 1950s. It also added to American fears of a widespread communist conspiracy within the government, fanned by Senator McCarthy. Bentley provided no documentary evidence to support her claims. Reporters and historians were divided for decades as to the validity of her allegations. In the 1990s, declassification of both Soviet documents and the U.S. codebreaking Venona project lent some credence to Bentley's allegations. After she defected, the Soviet Union temporarily suspended espionage activities in the United States. But some of Bentley's claims remain controversial due to questions about the accuracy of translations and the vague nature of identities, given that agents were identified by code names in encrypted records captured in Venona.

It is immediately north of Highway 402, and east of Colonel Talbot Road. Almost all of its residents live in low-density, single detached dwellings. As of 2011, the area is home to 4,410 residents. The neighbourhood is considered a middle to upper-income area, with an average family income of $129,685 an average dwelling value of $340,707 and a home ownership rate of 93%. History Lambeth was formerly a population centre in Westminster Township, Middlesex County, Ontario, Canada. It held the status of Police Village (lacking corporate status as a village, but administered by a board of trustees) until an effort was made by the local Reeve, David Murray, to stop annexation by the City of London which brought about the creation of the Town of Westminster in 1988, which itself ceased to exist on December 31, 1992. On January 1, 1993, the Town of Westminster, including the village of Lambeth, became part of the City of London. As Lambeth is still somewhat separated from the city's urban area, some residents still think of the neighbourhood as a distinct town, and there still official town limit signs when entering it. Its post office dates from 1857. During World War II, the Royal Canadian Navy set up an radio direction finding (radar) station at Lambeth. Its purpose was to acquire a bearing whenever a German U-boat transmitted a radio messages back to their HQ. The resultant bearing was then sent to the Officer-In-Charge in Ottawa over a dedicated teletype line. Direction finding equipment was housed in a white shack located at an airfield in what is now a big box retail complex at the northwest corner of Wharncliffe Road and Wonderland Road (formerly Airport Road) a couple of kilometres from Lambeth. The station began operating in the first few days of January 1943 and closed war‚Äôs end. Nothing remains of the runways or the buildings. Arts and culture The neighbourhood comes together to celebrate its agricultural past each fall. This celebration is called Harvestfest and it usually takes place the first week after Labour Day, beginning on the Thursday and running until late Sunday. It features many events such as a baseball tournament, an adult dance, teen dance, and pre-teen dance, parade, occasional rides for kids, pancake breakfast for the town, auto show and shine, as well as two beer tents in different locations featuring a live band all day and night. Lambeth celebrated its 200th anniversary of settlement throughout 2009. Government and politics Lambeth exists within the federal electoral district of Elgin‚ÄîMiddlesex‚ÄîLondon. It is currently represented by Karen Vecchio of the Conservative Party of Canada, first elected in 2015. Provincially, the area is within the constituency of Elgin‚ÄîMiddlesex‚ÄîLondon. It is currently represented by Jeff Yurek of the Progressive Conservative Party, first elected in 2003 and re-elected in 2011 and 2014. In London's non-partisan municipal politics, Lambeth lies within ward 9. It is currently represented by Councillor Anna Hopkins, first elected in 2014. Infrastructure Until 1960, Lambeth was served by the Byron Telephone Company. The Byron Telephone Company had installed its first automatic dial exchange in Lambeth in the late 1950s, the Oliver 2 exchange, which replaced the manual magneto phone system that continued to operate in the Byron area until September 1963. The Byron company was sold to Bell Canada in August 1960, and Byron itself, a population centre, was annexed to London on January 1, 1961. Immediately prior to the conversion to dial, the Byron operator was reached from London telephones by dialing 471, which became the exchange prefix upon conversion to dial.

Personal life In 1638, Murad Bakhsh, at the age of fourteen years married the Safavid princess, Sakina Banu Begum, a daughter of Shah Nawaz Khan Safavi. She was the younger sister of his elder sister-in-law, Dilras Banu Begum, who was Aurangzeb's wife.

During the same year he received the Ottoman ambassador Manzada Husain Agha, who arrived in the port of Surat and was on his way to meet Shah Jahan in Agra. Manzada Husain Agha mentions his disappointment regarding the wars between Shah Jahan's sons. Murad Bakhsh joined hands with Aurangzeb to defeat Dara Shikhoh, the eldest son of Shah Jahan. In fact it was the ferocious charge led by Murad Bakhsh and his Sowars that eventually turned the outcome of the battle in favor of Aurangzeb during the Battle of Samugarh. On 7 July 1658, while he was in a tent with his brother Aurangzeb, he was intoxicated and was secretly sent to the prison and transferred to Gwalior Fort from January 1659. He faced a trial that sentenced him to death for having murdered former Diwan clerk named Ali Naqi, in 1661.

The term \\"sub-Roman\\" was originally used to describe archaeological remains such as potsherds found in sites of the 5th and 6th centuries, and hinted at the decay of locally made wares from a previous higher standard that had existed under the Roman Empire. It is now more often used to denote this period of history instead. The term Post-Roman Britain is also used, mainly in non-archaeological contexts. Although the culture of Britain in the period was mainly derived from Roman and Celtic sources, there were also Saxons settled as foederati in the area, originally from Saxony in northwestern Germany. Saxons and other Germanic peoples gradually assumed more control, creating Anglo-Saxon England in the process. The Picts in northern Scotland were outside the applicable area. Meaning of terms The period of sub-Roman Britain traditionally covers the history of the area which subsequently became England from the end of Roman imperial rule, traditionally dated to be in 410, to the arrival of Saint Augustine in 597. The date taken for the end of this period is arbitrary in that the sub- Roman culture continued in northern England until the merger of Rheged (the kingdom of the Brigantes) with Northumbria by dynastic marriage in 633, and longer in the West of England, and Cornwall, Cumbria and Wales especially. This period has attracted a great deal of academic and popular debate, in part because of the scarcity of the written source material. The term \\"post-Roman Britain\\" is also used for the period, mainly in non-archaeological contexts; \\"sub-Roman\\" and \\"post-Roman\\" are both terms that apply to the old Roman province of Britannia, i.e. Britain south of the Forth‚ÄìClyde line. The history of the area between Hadrian's Wall and the Forth‚ÄìClyde line is similar to that of Wales (see Rheged, Bernicia, Gododdin and Strathclyde). North of the line lay a thinly populated area including the kingdoms of the Maeatae (in Angus), Dalriada (in Argyll), and the kingdom whose kaer (castle) near Inverness was visited by Saint Columba. The Romans referred to these peoples collectively as Picti, meaning 'Painted Ones'. The term \\"late antiquity\\", implying wider horizons, is finding more use in the academic community, especially when transformations of classical culture common throughout the post-Roman West are examined; it is less successfully applied to Britain at the time. The period may also be considered as part of the early Middle Ages, if continuity with the following periods is stressed. Popular (and some academic) works use a range of more dramatic names for the period: the Dark Ages, the Brythonic Age, the Age of Tyrants, or the Age of Arthur.John Morris, The Age of Arthur (1973) is his title for a popular history of the British Isles from 350 to 650. Written accounts There is very little extant written material available from this period, though there is a considerable amount from later periods that may be relevant. A lot of what is available deals with the first few decades of the 5th century only. The sources can usefully be classified into British and continental, and into contemporary and non-contemporary. Two primary contemporary British sources exist: the Confessio of Saint Patrick and Gildas' De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae (On the Ruin and Conquest of Britain).Discussion in Ken Dark, Britain and the End of the Roman Empire, (Stroud: Tempus, 2000), pp.32‚Äì7 Patrick's Confessio and his Letter to Coroticus reveal aspects of life in Britain, from where he was abducted to Ireland. It is particularly useful in highlighting the state of Christianity at the time. Gildas is the nearest to a source of Sub-Roman history but there are many problems in using it. The document represents British history as he and his audience understood it. Though a few other documents of the period do exist, such as Gildas' letters on monasticism, they are not directly relevant to British history. Gildas' De Excidio is a jeremiad: it is written as a polemic to warn contemporary rulers against sin, demonstrating through historical and biblical examples that bad rulers are always punished by God ‚Äì in the case of Britain, through the destructive wrath of the Saxon invaders. The historical section of De Excidio is short, and the material in it is clearly selected with Gildas' purpose in mind. There are no absolute dates given, and some of the details, such as those regarding the Hadrian's and Antonine Walls are clearly wrong. Nevertheless, Gildas does provide us with an insight into some of the kingdoms that existed when he was writing, and how an educated monk perceived the situation that had developed between the Anglo- Saxons and the Britons. There are more continental contemporary sources that mention Britain, though these are highly problematic. The most famous is the so-called Rescript of Honorius, in which the Western Emperor Honorius tells the British civitates to look to their own defence. The first reference to this rescript is written by the 6th century Byzantine scholar Zosimus and is found in the middle of a discussion of southern Italy; no further mention of Britain is made, which has led some, though not all, modern academics to suggest that the rescript does not apply to Britain, but to Bruttium in Italy.Birley, Anthony Richard The Roman Government of Britain OUP Oxford (29 Sep 2005) pp.461-463 Halsall, Guy Barbarian migrations and the Roman West, 376‚Äì568 Cambridge University Press; illustrated edition (20 Dec 2007) pp.217-218Discussion in Martin Millett, The Romanization of Britain, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990) and in Philip Bartholomew 'Fifth-Century Facts' Britannia vol. 13, 1982 p. 260 The Gallic Chronicles, Chronica Gallica of 452 and Chronica Gallica of 511, say prematurely that \\"Britain, abandoned by the Romans, passed into the power of the Saxons\\" and provide information about St Germanus and his visit(s) to Britain, though again this text has received considerable academic deconstruction.Michael Jones and John Casey, 'The Gallic Chronicle Restored: A Chronology for the Anglo-Saxon Invasions and the End of Roman Britain', Britannia 19, (1988), pp.367-98; R.W. Burgess, 'The Dark Ages Return to Fifth-Century Britain: The 'Restored' Gallic Chronicle Exploded', Britannia 21, (1990), pp.185-195 The work of Procopius, another 6th-century Byzantine writer, makes some references to Britain, though the accuracy of these is uncertain. There are numerous later written sources that claim to provide accurate accounts of the period. The first to attempt this was the monk Bede, writing in the early 8th century. He based his account of the Sub-Roman period in his Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum (written around 731) heavily on Gildas, though he tried to provide dates for the events Gildas describes. It was written from an anti- Briton point of view. Later sources, such as the Historia Brittonum often attributed to Nennius, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle (again written from a non- Briton point of view, based on West Saxon sources) and the Annales Cambriae, are all heavily shrouded in myth and can only be used with caution as evidence for this period.David Dumville, \\"Sub-Roman Britain: History and Legend\\", History 62, (1977), pp.173‚Äì192 There are also documents giving Welsh poetry (of Taliesin and Aneirin) and land deeds (Llandaff charters) that appear to date back to the 6th century. After the Norman Conquest there were many books written that purport to give the history of the Sub-Roman period. These have been influenced by the fictionalised account in Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae (History of the Kings of Britain). Therefore, they can only be regarded as showing how the legends grew. Not until modern times have serious studies of the period been undertaken. Some \\"Lives of Saints\\" relating to Celtic clerics are early, but most are late and unreliable. St. Thaddaeus is described as visiting a Roman villa at Chepstow, while St Cuthbert visited deserted Carlisle. Archaeological evidence Archaeology provides further evidence for this period, though of a different nature from that provided by documents. Archaeology suggested to Richard Reece that the depopulation of Roman towns and the development of villa and estate organization was already occurring in the 4th century.\\"Town and Country: The End of Roman Britain\\", World Archaeology 12.1, (June 1980:77-92); Simon T. Loseby, \\"Power and towns in Late Roman Britain and early Anglo-Saxon England\\" in Gisela Ripoll and Josep M. Gurt, eds., Sedes regiae (ann. 400‚Äì800), (Barcelona, 2000:319-70 (on-line text ) makes a strong case for the discontinuty of urban life. The 5th and 6th centuries in Britain are marked by a sharp discontinuity in town life, perhaps always a somewhat artificial Roman imposition on the landscape, dependent on imperial military requirements and requirements of administration and tax collection; the exceptions are a handful of sites: Londinium, Eboracum, Canterbury, WroxeterPhilip Barker's excavation in the Baths Basilica at Wroxeter, (1975) is noted by R. Reece, \\"Town and country: the end of Roman Britain\\", World Archaeology, 1980. and possibly Cambridge, but the discontinuity in the episcopate, \\"the institution most responsible for the survival of towns in Gaul\\", as H. R. Loyn observes, speaks against town survival in Britain.H.R. Loyn, Anglo-Saxon England and the Norman Conquest, 2nd ed. 1991:15f: \\"it is altogether unlikely that organized town-life can have survived through the troubles of the fifth and sixth centuries. Gildas lamented the destruction of the twenty-eight cities of Britain, and there is no reason to doubt the essential truth of his statement\\" (p16). The Roman villa system, represented by some five hundred archaeological sites, did not survive either; unlike Gaul, in Britain not a single villa name survived into the Germanic period. It may be possible that the villa system did not survive the disastrous Pictish incursions in 367 and following years.Loyn 1991:16f. In the sub-Roman period, building in stone came to an end; buildings were constructed of less durable materials than during the Roman period. However, brooches, pottery and weapons from this period have survived. The study of burials and cremations, and the grave goods associated with these, has done much to expand the understanding of cultural identities in the period.See discussion in A.S. Esmonde Cleary, \\"The Roman to medieval transition\\" in Britons and Romans: advancing an archaeological agenda. ed. S. James & M. Millett, (York: Council for British Archaeology, 2001) Archaeology has shown some evidence of continuity with Roman education, trade with the Mediterranean and with Celtic art. Excavations of settlements have revealed possible changes in social structures, and to what extent life in Britain continued unaltered in certain pockets into the early medieval period. Hilltops, the so-called \\"hillforts\\", castra and monasteries have been excavated. Work on towns has been particularly important. Work on the hill- forts has shown evidence of refurbishment, and also of overseas trade, in this period. One of the earliest major excavations was at Tintagel (Radford 1939). This uncovered rectangular structures and much Mediterranean pottery. The buildings were initially interpreted as a monastery, but later as a princely stronghold and trading post. Another important excavation was at Dinas Powys (Alcock 1963) which showed evidence of metalworking. Alcock also led the excavations at South Cadbury (Alcock 1995). Many other sites have now been shown to have been occupied during the sub-Roman period, including Birdoswald and Saxon Shore forts. Work on field systems and environmental archaeology has also highlighted how much agricultural practice continued and changed over the period.John Davey, \\"The Environs of South Cadbury in the Late Antique and Early Medieval Periods\\" in Debating Late Antiquity in Britain AD 300-700. ed. Rob Collins & James Gerrard, (Oxford: British Archaeological Review, 2004) Archaeology, however, has its limits, especially in dating. Although radiocarbon dating can provide a rough estimate, this is not accurate enough to associate archaeological finds with historical events. Dendrochronology is accurate enough to do this, though few suitable pieces of wood have been uncovered. Roman coins findings clearly indicate the areas of biggest \\"romanization\\" and presence in Roman Britain Coins would normally be the most useful tool for dating, but not for sub-Roman Britain since no newly minted coins are believed to have entered circulation after the very early 5th century.A.S. Esmond Cleary, The Ending of Roman Britain, (London: Batsford, 1989), pp.138-139 There is some archaeological evidence for Anglo-Saxons and Britons living on the same site. For example, in the cemetery at Wasperton, Warwickshire, one can see a family adopting Anglo-Saxon culture over a long period.Helena Hamerow, 'The earliest Anglo-Saxon kingdoms' in The New Cambridge Medieval History, I, c.500-c.700. ed. Paul Fouracre, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), p.265 Breakdown of Roman society Because of the sparse evidence for the period, many interpretations are possible. Some have taken all the sources at their face value (e.g. Alcock 1971, Morris 1973, Ashe 1985) and others set aside the non-contemporary sources. Any interpretation can only be tentative and dates more so. At the start of the 5th century, Britannia was part of the Western Roman Empire under Honorius.http://www.worcester.ac.uk/8805.html, http://www.worcester.ac.uk/8816.html But there were already signs of decline, and some Saxons may already have been in England as mercenaries. Some Roman troops were withdrawn by Stilicho in 402, and bulk coin payments ceased around then. In 406 the army in Britain revolted, electing three successive \\"tyrants\\", the last of whom took further troops to Gaul. He established himself briefly as Constantine III but was defeated and subsequently executed in 411. Meanwhile, there were barbarian raids on Britain in 408, but these seem to have been defeated. After 410 Honorius apparently sent letters to the cities of Britain telling them to fend for themselves, though this is sometimes disputed.Birley, Anthony Richard The Roman Government of Britain OUP Oxford (29 Sep 2005) pp.461-463 Halsall, Guy Barbarian migrations and the Roman West, 376-568 Cambridge University Press; illustrated edition (20 Dec 2007) pp.217-218 Discussion in Martin Millett, The Romanization of Britain, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990) and in Philip Bartholomew 'Fifth-Century Facts' Britannia vol. 13, 1982 p. 260 The withdrawal of most Roman troops did not end the Roman culture of the \\"lost province\\", which still remained part of the Roman cultural world, with inhabitants who identified themselves as Roman. From the middle of the 5th century the Germanic raiders began to settle in the eastern river valleys.H.R. Loyn, Anglo-Saxon England and the Norman Conquest, 2nd ed. 1991:3. Later civil wars seem to have broken out, which have been interpreted either as being between pro-Roman and independence groups or between \\"Established Church\\" and Pelagian parties (Myres 1965, Morris 1965), a class struggle between peasants and land owners (Thompson 1977, Wood 1984) and a coup by an urban elite (Snyder 1988). A recent view explored by LaycockLaycock, Britannia the Failed State 2008. sees Britain violently fragmenting into kingdoms based on British tribal identities; 'violently' is disputable, but clearly most of the civitates gradually transformed into kingdoms. Life seems to have continued much as before in the countryside, and on a reduced scale in the towns as evidenced by the descriptions of Germanus' visits. Feuding kingships replaced the centrally governed Roman provinces. Gildas says that a \\"council\\" was convened by Vortigern to find ways of countering the barbarian threat. The council opted to hire Saxon mercenaries, following Roman practice. After a while these turned against the British and plundered the towns. A British leader, Ambrosius Aurelianus, fought against them in a number of battles apparently over a long period. Towards the end of this period was the Battle of Mons Badonicus, around 490, which later sources claimed was won by King Arthur, though Gildas does not identify him. After this there was a long period of peace. The British seem to have been in control of England and Wales roughly west of a line from York to Bournemouth. The Saxons had control of eastern areas in an arc from East Yorkshire through Lincolnshire and perhaps Nottinghamshire, to East Anglia and South East England. Writing in Latin, perhaps about 540, Gildas gives an account of the history of Britain, but the earlier part (for which other sources are available) is severely muddled. He castigates five rulers in western Britain ‚Äì Constantine of Dumnonia, Aurelius Caninus, Vortipor of the Demetae, Cuneglasus and Maglocunus (Mailcun or in later spelling Maelgwn of Gwynedd) ‚Äì for their sins. He also attacks the British clergy. He gives information on the British diet, dress and entertainment. He writes that Britons were killed, emigrated or were enslaved but gives no idea of numbers. In the late 6th century there was another period of Saxon expansion, starting with the capture of Searoburh in 552 by the dynasty that later ruled Wessex, and including entry into the Cotswolds area after the Battle of Deorham (577), though the accuracy of the entries in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle for this period has been questioned. These conquests are often said by modern writers, on no clear evidence, to have separated the Britons of South West England (known later as the West Welsh) from those of Wales. (Just after the period being discussed, the Battle of Chester in 611 might have separated the latter from those of the north of England.) Until the 570s, the Britons were still in control of about half of England and Wales. Kingdoms Britain c. 540, in the time of Gildas Various British kingdoms existed at some point in the period. Some changed their names and some were absorbed by others. Not all of their names, especially in the southeast, are known, nor are the details of their political development; some authority structures left from the Roman period may have continued in charge of some areas for some time. At times some of the kingdoms were united by a ruler who was an overlord, while wars occurred between others. During the period the boundaries are likely to have changed. The major ones were: * Bryneich ‚Äì Northumberland; eventually taken by the Angles of Bernicia * Dumnonia ‚Äì south west England, Cornwall and much of Devon * Lindinis \\\\- Somerset, Bristol, and parts of Devon, north Dorset, and western Wiltshire. * Dyfed ‚Äì south west Wales * Ergyng ‚Äì south west Herefordshire, northern Monmouthshire and the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire * Gwent, Brycheiniog and Glywysing ‚Äì south Wales * Powys ‚Äì mid Wales * Gwynedd ‚Äì north Wales * Elmet ‚Äì south west Yorkshire * Rheged ‚Äì Cumbria and Lancashire * Ebrauc ‚Äì around York and northern Yorkshire * Strathclyde ‚Äì (c. 900 ‚Äì c. 1100) in south west Scotland, Cumberland, Westmorland * Gododdin ‚Äì centred on Traprain Law in Lothian Some areas fell under the domination of Anglian or Saxon chieftains, later kingdoms: * Bernicia ‚Äì the Anglian kingdom of Bernicia before joining with Deira to become Northumbria * Deira ‚Äì the Anglian kingdom of Deira before joining with Bernicia to become Northumbria (East Yorkshire) * East Anglia ‚Äì including Suffolk and Norfolk * Kent * Hwicce ‚Äì most of Gloucestershire except the Forest of Dean and western Oxfordshire. * Sussex \\\\- including the settlement of Haestingas, containing people of possibly Jutish origin. * Essex ‚Äì including Middlesex and Surrey * Wessex ‚Äì formed from areas in the upper Thames valley and later incorporating an area of Jutish settlement in the Meon Valley and around Southampton (including Isle of Wight) * Mercia ‚Äì centred on Repton * Middle Anglia ‚Äì east Midlands, later joined with Mercia * Northumbria ‚Äì formed from Bernicia and Deira * Wihtwara =Religion= Officially the Roman Empire was Christian at the start of the 5th century, but there is evidence of rural pagan temples being refurbished at the start of this period in western England. However, most temples seem to have been replaced eventually by Christian churches on the same site or nearby. \\"Celtic\\" churches or monasteries seem to have flourished during this period in the British areas, such as that at Glastonbury, though mostly not until the 6th century; but the \\"Saxons\\" were pagan. This reinforced a great antipathy between the peoples. Many Roman cemeteries continued into much later times, such as that at Cannington, Somerset. In the east there was a gradual transition among the pagan Saxons from cremation to inhumation. Although the arrival of Saint Augustine is traditionally seen as the significant Christianising event for the Saxons, a bishop had already arrived in Kent with the king's Merovingian wife. Other Saxons remained pagan after this time. In 429, a British Deacon, Palladius, had requested support from the Pope in Rome to combat Pelagianism. Bishops Germanus and Lupus of Troyes were sent. Germanus, a former military commander, is reported to have led the British to the \\"Hallelujah\\" victory, possibly in Wales or Herefordshire. Germanus is saidThompson, E. A.

Participation by a British bishop at a synod in Gaul demonstrates that at least some British churches were in full administrative and doctrinal touch with Gaul as late as 455.H. R. Loyn, Anglo-Saxon England and the Norman Conquest, 2nd ed. 1991:3. In the north, Whithorn is said to be the earliest church in Scotland, being founded in 397 by Saint Ninian. Coroticus (or Ceretic) was a Christian king who was the recipient of the letter from Saint Patrick. His base may have been Dumbarton Rock on the River Clyde, and his descendant Rhydderch Hael is named in the Life of Saint Columba. Rhydderch was a contemporary of √Åed√°n mac Gabr√°in of Dal Riata and Urien of Rheged in the late 6th century, as well as of √Üthelfrith of Bernicia. Unlike Columba, Kentigern, the supposed apostle to the Britons of the Clyde and alleged founder of Glasgow, is a shadowy figure. Anglo-Saxon migration The famous alt= =Linguistic evidence= Linguistics is useful in the analysis of culture, and to an extent political associations. Bede in Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum (completed in 731) wrote that \\"currently, [there are in Britain] the languages of five peoples, namely that of the Angles (English), the Britons (Welsh), the Scots (Gaelic), the Picts and the Latins\\" (HE 1.1).in praesenti ... quinque gentium linguis, ... Anglorum uidelicet, Brettonum, Scottorum, Pictorum et Latinorum A review of the changes in the Brythonic language during this period is given by Kenneth H. Jackson.See Kenneth Jackson, Language and History in Early Britain: A Chronological Survey of the Brittonic Languages, (Edinburgh, 1953) for a traditional introduction Studies of Old English, P- and Q-Celtic and Latin have provided evidence for contact among the Britons, the Gaels, and the Anglo-Saxons. The consensus is that Old English has little evidence of linguistic contact. Some scholars have suggested that there is more evidence in the grammar than in the lexicon, though this is challenged by many. Latin continued to be used for writing but the extent of its use for speech has been much disputed. Similarly, studies of place names give clues about the linguistic history of an area. England (except Cornwall and Cumbria) shows patchy evidence now of Celtic in its place names. There are scattered Celtic place names throughout, increasing towards the west. There are also Celtic river names and topographical names. An explanation of the toponymic and linguistic evidence is that Anglo-Saxon language and culture became dominant due to their political and social preeminence in the south and east of Britain. Names with a Latin element may suggest continuity of settlement, while some places are named for pagan Germanic deities. Names of British origin may or may not indicate survival of a British population. Names based on the Anglo-Saxon word for the British, wealh, are also taken as indicating British survival. An example is Walton, meaning settlement of the BritishHamerow, H. 1993 Excavations at Mucking, Volume 2: The Anglo-Saxon Settlement (English Heritage Archaeological Report 21) and this name is found in many parts of England, though it sometimes means Wall-town. Surviving inscriptions on stones provide another source of information on the settlements of Britons and the Anglo-Saxons. Celtic inscribed stones from this period occur in western England, Wales and southern Scotland. Inscriptions in parts of Scotland, Wales, and Cornwall, are in ogham, some containing forms which scholars have not been able to understand. =Extent of the migrations= Two contrasting models of the end of sub-Roman Britain have been described by Richard Reece as \\"decline and immigration\\" and \\"invasion and displacement\\". It has long been held that the Anglo-Saxons migrated to Britain in large numbers in the 5th and 6th centuries, substantially displacing the British people. The Anglo-Saxon historian Frank Stenton in 1943, although making considerable allowance for British survival, essentially sums up this view, arguing \\"that the greater part of southern England was overrun in the first phase of the war\\".F.M. Stenton, The Anglo- Saxons, 3rd edition, (Oxford: University Press, 1973), p.30 This interpretation was based on the written sources, particularly Gildas but also the later sources such as the Anglo-Saxon historian Bede, that cast the arrival of the Anglo-Saxons as a violent event. The toponymic and linguistic evidence was also considered to support this interpretation, as very few British place names survived in eastern Britain, very few British Celtic words entered the Old English language and the Brythonic language and peoples migrated from south-western Britain to Armorica, which eventually became Brittany. This interpretation particularly appealed to earlier English historians, who wanted to further their view that England had developed differently from Europe, with a limited monarchy and love of liberty. This, it was argued, came from the mass Anglo-Saxon invasions. While this view was never universal ‚Äì Edward Gibbon believed that there had been a great deal of British survival ‚Äì it was the dominant paradigm. Though many scholars would now employ this argument, the traditional view is still held by many other historians, Lawrence James writing in 2002 that England was \\"submerged by an Anglo-Saxon current which swept away the Romano-British.\\"Lawrence James, Warrior Race, (London: Abacus. 2002), p.30 The traditional view has been partly deconstructed (considerably in some circles) since the 1990s, with a reduction in the numbers of Anglo-Saxons believed to have arrived in Britain. A lower figure is sometimes accepted, which would mean that it is highly unlikely that the existing British population was substantially displaced by the Anglo-Saxons.Michael Jones, The End of Roman Britain, pp.8-38. If fewer Anglo-Saxons arrived, it is proposed that they formed a ruling elite, with acculturation of the local population. Thus some \\"Saxon\\" graves may be of Britons, though many scholars disagree.Andrew Tyrrell, Corpus Saxon in Social Identity in Early Medieval Britain by Andrew Tyrrell and William O. Frazer (London: Leicester University Press. 2000) Two genetic studies published in 2016, using data from ancient burials found in Cambridgeshire, Yorkshire and Durham, found that the ancestry of the modern-day English population contained substantial contributions from both Anglo-Saxon and Celtic peoples. End of Roman Britain Various dates have been proposed to mark the end of Roman Britain, including the end of Roman currency coinage importation in 402, Constantine III's rebellion in 407, the rebellion mentioned by Zosimus in 409, and the Rescript of Honorius in 410.See for instance E.A. Thompson, 'Britain, AD 406-410', Britannia 8, (1977), pp.303-18 and P. Bartholomew, 'Fifth-Century Facts', Britannia 13, (1982), pp.261-70 Unlike modern decolonisation, the dating of the end of Roman Britain is complex, and the exact process is unknown. There is some controversy as to why Roman rule ended in Britain. The view first advocated by Theodor Mommsen was that Rome left Britain.See discussion in Michael Jones, The End of Roman Britain, (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1996), pp.256-7 This argument was substantiated over time, most recently by A.S. Esmonde-Cleary.Esmonde-Cleary, The Ending of Roman Britain, p.161 According to this argument, internal turmoil in the Roman Empire and the need to withdraw troops to fight off barbarian armies led Rome to abandon Britain. It was the collapse of the imperial system that led to the end of imperial rule in Britain. However, Michael Jones has advanced an alternative thesis that argues that Rome did not leave Britain, but that Britain left Rome.Michael Jones, The End of Roman Britain, esp. chapters 4 and 7 He highlights the numerous usurpers who came from Britain in the late 4th and early 5th centuries, and points out that the supply of coinage to Britain had dried up by the early 5th century, so that administrators and troops were not getting paid. All of this, he argues, led the British people to rebel against Rome. Both of these arguments are open to criticism, and the question is still open. It was a violent period, and there was probably widespread tension, alluded to in all the written sources. This may have led to the deaths of many Britons. There are also references to plagues. Laycock (Britannia the Failed State, 2008) suggests tribal conflict, possibly even starting before 410, may have sliced up much of Britain and helped destroy the economy. The evidence from land use suggests a decline in production, which might be a sign of population decline.Davey, The Environs of South Cadbury, p50 It is clear that some British people migrated to Europe, and Armorica in northwest Gaul became known as Brittany. There is also evidence of British migration to Gallaecia, in Hispania. The dates of these migrations are uncertain, but recent studies suggest that the migration from south western Britain to Brittany may have begun as early as 300 and had largely ended by 500. These settlers, unlikely to be refugees if the date was this early, made their presence felt in the naming of the westernmost, Atlantic-facing provinces of Armorica, Kerne/Cornouaille (\\"Kernow/Cornwall\\") and Domnonea (\\"Devon\\").Gwena√´l le Duc, \\"The Colonisation of Brittany from Britain: New Approaches and Questions\\" in Celtic Connections: Proceedings of the Tenth International Congress of Celtic Studies. Volume One. ed. Black, Gillies and √ì Maolaigh, (East Linton: Tuckwell Press, 1999), However, there is clear linguistic evidence for close contact between the south west of Britain and Brittany across the sub-Roman period.Wendy Davies, \\"The Celtic Kingdoms\\" in The New Cambridge Medieval History, Volume I, c.500-c.700. ed. Paul Fouracre, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), pp255‚Äì61 In Galicia, in the north west corner of the Iberian peninsula, another region of traditional Celtic culture, the Suebian Parochiale, drawn up about 580, includes a list of the principal churches of each diocese in the metropolitanate of Braga (the ecclesia Britonensis, now Breto√±a), which was the seat of a bishop who ministered to the spiritual needs of the British immigrants to northwestern Spain: in 572 the bishop, Mailoc, had a Celtic name.Fletcher, Saint James's Catapult, ch. 1, note 61. The settlers had brought their Celtic Christianity with them but finally accepted the Latin Rite at the Council of Toledo in 633. The diocese stretched from Ferrol to the Eo River. In Spain, the area has sometimes been dubbed \\"the third Britain\\" or \\"the last Britain\\".\\"San Rosendo, bispo dunha Igrexa direfente nunha Galicia distinta\\" , La Voz de Galicia Non- Anglo-Saxon kingdoms began appearing in western Britain, and are first referred to in Gildas' De Excidio. To an extent these kingdoms may have derived from Roman structures.Ken Dark, Britain and the End of the Roman Empire, pp.150‚Äì192 But it is also clear that they drew on a strong influence from Hibernia, which was never part of the Roman Empire. Archaeology has helped further the study of these kingdoms, notably at sites like Tintagel or the hillfort at South Cadbury. In the north there developed the British kingdoms of the Hen Ogledd, the \\"Old North\\", comprising Ebrauc (probable name), Bryneich, Rheged, Strathclyde, Elmet and Gododdin. 5th- and 6th-century repairs along Hadrian's Wall have been uncovered, and at Whithorn in south western Scotland (possibly the site of Ninian's monastery). Chance discoveries have helped document the continuing urban occupation of some Roman towns such as Wroxeter and Caerwent.Roger White and Philip Barker, Wroxeter: Life and Death of a Roman City, (Stroud: Tempus, 1998)\\"Archaeological assessment of Wroxeter, Shropshire\\" by Roger White and Hal Dalwood Continued urban use might be associated with an ecclesiastical structure. Western Britain has attracted those archaeologists who wish to place King Arthur as a historical figure.Leslie Alcock, Arthur's Britain: History and Archaeology AD 367‚Äì634, (Harmondsworth: Allen Lane, 1971), ; Francis Pryor, Britain AD: A Quest for Arthur, England and the Anglo-Saxons. (Harper Collins, 2004), Though there is little contemporary written evidence for this, archaeological evidence does suggest that a Romano-British king might have wielded considerable power during the sub-Roman period, as demonstrated by the creation of sites such as Tintagel and earthworks such as the Wansdyke. Such interpretations continue to attract the popular imagination and the scepticism of academics. While pushed back politically and linguistically, British scholars and ecclesiastics had a significant impact on the Anglo-Saxon newcomers through literacy, ecclesiastical social constructs and historical memory of the Roman period in Britain, particularly after the Christianizing of the Anglo-Saxons. Coming from a fully oral cultural background, the Anglo-Saxons were heavily influenced by the more developed Christianized and literate culture of the Britons. British scholars were often employed at Anglo-Saxon courts to assist in the management of the kingdoms. This reintroduced British culture to those parts of Britain lost to the British politically. The epitome of this process is the adoption of the legendary British war leader, King Arthur, as the national hero of the English, due to the literary work of Welsh historians. Environmental change effects There is evidence for climate change in the 5th century, with conditions turning cooler and wetter. This shortened the growing season and made uplands unsuited to growing grain. Dendrochronology reveals a particular climatic event in 540.Davey, 'The Environs of South Cadbury', p.50 Michael Jones suggests that declining agricultural production from land that was already fully exploited had considerable demographic consequences.Jones, The End of Roman Britain, pp.186-243 Population fluctuation =Theories for reduction= Background Slaves were important in the economy and the army in the Roman Empire. Estimates for the prevalence of slavery in the Roman Empire vary: some estimate that around 30% of the population of the Empire in the 1st century was enslaved. A more recent study suggests 10-15% even for the early empire \\"as any greater estimate would require implausible levels of transformation in a pre-modern context.\\" The difference the lower percentage in the Later Roman Empire can be attributed to fewer slaves in sub elite households and agricultural estates (replaced by a great expansion in various types of tenancy). The Germanic region was one of the main sources of slaves. It was mainly wholesale dealers, who followed the Roman armies, who sold slaves. After the Empire expanded, there were fewer places to obtain slaves. Around 210, piracy increased around the North Sea and boosted the supply, taken from villages in that area, along with those captured for ransom. Britain was not easily defensible. It did not pay completely the costs of occupation. Nevertheless the Romans were forced to keep 3 or 4 legions, 30-40,000 men with auxiliary units in place to defend it. They managed fairly well until the collapse of Roman authority after the garrison was reduced in size by Magnus Maximus in 388 and Stilicho in 401. It seems that post-350 the Roman government was having more difficulty in recruiting soldiers. In an effort to remedy the situation it resorted to payment instead of provision of recruit, the aurum tironicum. Landowners could pay a set fee to prevent any of their tenants from being pressed into the army (slaves were rarely resorted to even at critical moments in exchange for their freedom).A.H. M. Jones, LRE. pp. 184, 363, 64 Not enough men wanted to enter military service. The gold from the tax led to a greater use of Germanic or other tribal groups who did not need to be expensively equipped, housed and paid pensions, as the tax was used to recruit mercenaries as foederati, but it also drained the treasury. Previously foreigners were put into units, the auxilia, officered by Romans. Roman army units, the smaller Later Roman legions, continued to exist but gradually disappeared in the 5th century leaving defense of the Empire to hirelings. After the Battle of Adrianople, the Gothic foederati, by the Treaty of 382, were allowed to remain with the Empire intact, which reversed the centuries-old Roman policy of destroying barbarian enemies by killing them all, selling them or incorporating them into the Roman army by scattering them across units. The hospitalitas system granted a third of the land (or fees) of a region to barbarians who had invaded and occupied those lands assigned to them. In return, these people declared loyalty to the Emperor and provided military support, whilst retaining their independence. If the theory is correct, Germanic peoples may have been resident in Britain before and after these reforms. One thing led to another to create a spiral. The policy of substituting mercenaries who were paid in gold which should have gone to support the professional standing army and accommodation to their presence spelled the doom of the Western Empire. The federates, operating from within the boundaries of the Empire, eventually became the new landlords, as there was no professional Roman army to subdue them. Ancient authors bitterly comment on this series of policy mistakes. The East which relied far less on mercenaries escaped Britain's fate. The Britons in the decades post-410 repeated the mistakes the emperors had done with the Visigoths, Burgundians, Sueves, Vandals and Franks - they invited mercenaries to protect them, then those same mercenaries subsequently took control over Britain. Plague of Justinian The population of Britain may have decreased by between 1.5 and 3 million after the Roman period, perhaps caused by environmental changes (the Late Antique Little Ice Age) and, subsequently, by plague and smallpox (around 600, the smallpox spread from India into Europe). It is known that the Plague of Justinian entered the Mediterranean world in the 6th century and first arrived in the British Isles in 544 or 545, when it reached Ireland. It is estimated that the Plague of Justinian killed as many as 100 million people across the world. As a result, Europe's population fell by around 50% between 550 and 700. The later medieval Welsh Lludd and Llefelys mentions a series of three plagues affecting the British of London. Anglo-Saxon settlement According to research led by University College London, Anglo-Saxon settlers could have enjoyed a substantial social and economic advantage over the native Celtic Britons who lived in what is now England, for more than 300 years from the middle of the 5th century. However, this scenario, assuming that the Anglo-Saxons were just Germanic Ingaevones, has been questioned. Minor migrations theories The traditional view about the numbers of Anglo-Saxons arriving in Britain during this period has been deconstructed. Incoming people uniting with the existing population could explain why the island conquest was as slow and incomplete as it was, and why the island was exposed to external attacks by Danish pirates and Normans, as well as other issues about the population composition. =Stephen Oppenheimer's theory= Stephen Oppenheimer, basing his research on the Weale and Capelli studies, maintains that none of the invasions since the Romans have had a significant impact on the gene pool of the British Isles, and that the inhabitants from prehistoric times belong to an Iberian genetic grouping. He says that most people in the British Isles are genetically similar to the Basque people of northern Spain and southwestern France, from 90% in Wales to 66% in East Anglia. Oppenheimer suggests that the division between the West and the East of England is not due to the Anglo-Saxon invasion but originates with two main routes of genetic flow ‚Äì one up the Atlantic coast, the other from neighbouring areas of Continental Europe ‚Äì which occurred just after the Last Glacial Maximum. He reports work on linguistics by Forster and Toth which suggests that Indo-European languages began to fragment some 10,000 years ago, at the end of the last Ice Age. He claims that the Celtic languages split from the Indo-European earlier than previously suspected, some 6000 years ago. He claims that the English language split from the other Germanic languages before the Roman period, and became the English that was spoken by the Belgae tribes of what is now southern and eastern England, northeastern France, and Belgium prior to their conquest by the Romans, and long before the arrival of the Anglo-Saxon.Oppenheimer, S. (2006). The Origins of the British: A Genetic Detective Story: Constable and Robinson, London. . Bryan Sykes came to fairly similar conclusions as Oppenheimer in his research, which he set forth in his 2006 published book Blood of the Isles: Exploring the Genetic Roots of our Tribal History, published in the United States and Canada as Saxons, Vikings and Celts: The Genetic Roots of Britain and Ireland. In its summary of their article \\"Who were the Celts?\\", the National Museum of Wales note, \\"It is possible that future genetic studies of ancient and modern human DNA may help to inform our understanding of the subject. However, early studies have, so far, tended to produce implausible conclusions from very small numbers of people and using outdated assumptions about linguistics and archaeology\\".

Finnskogen (\\"Forest of the Finns\\") is an area of Norway and Sweden situated in the counties of Innlandet and V√§rmland respectively, named so because of immigration of Finnish people in the 17th century, the so-called Skogfinner/\\"Forest Finns\\". The core area of Finnskogen lies in the eastern part of a small region known as Sol√∏r, on the border with Sweden. It consists of a forested belt of land, about wide. It is adjacent to the Swedish region with similar Finnish immigration, named Finnskogarna. There are also similar forested areas in other parts of eastern Norway, Brandval, Vinger Finnskog of Kongsvinger (Austmarka), S√∏re Osen, Finnemarka near the city of Drammen and in Nordmarka just outside Oslo. History Finns, or Finnish people, were encouraged to migrate from the Finnish part of the Kingdom of Sweden to Sweden proper, where they were initially well received by the Duke of S√∂dermanland (who became King Karl IX (1604‚Äì1611). At the time, the kingdom of Sweden covered both Sweden and Finland as we know them today. The migrants were settled on crown lands in V√§rmland and Dalsland to occupy the area immediately adjacent to the border with Denmark-Norway. More were encouraged to come to Sweden during the reign of Gustavus Adolphus (1611‚Äì1632). The local Swedish peasants did not appreciate the immigrants, who lived by slash-burn agriculture (svedjebruk), and tensions led to persecution. In 1636 a Swedish decree evicted all Finns who were not registered as taxpayers, which in practice amounted to an expulsion of most of the Finns. Most moved across the Norwegian border into Sol√∏r, forming a colony at Grue. The 1686 census indicates many there were born in Finland, but had been living in Sweden before eventually settling in Norway.East Norway and Its Frontier by Frank Noel Stagg, George Allen & Unwin, Ltd. 1956 Their loyalties during the Hannibal War (1643‚Äì1645) were with Sweden and some were caught spying on Norwegian troops. In 1709 the Danish-Norwegian general Hausmann so distrusted them that he ordered they all be evacuated from Sol√∏r. The bailiff declined to evict them on the basis that they were subsistence farmers and so poor they would have starved if moved from the land they customarily used. By the 20th century the blood had so intermingled that it was probably impossible to find inhabitants of pure Finnish descent in the Finnskogen. But in Grue, over a quarter of the place names are still in Finnish.

Meanwhile, Mr. Garrison gets a nose job that makes him resemble actor David Hasselhoff. \\"Tom's Rhinoplasty\\" was the first Valentine's Day-themed episode of the series and was written by series co-creator Trey Parker. The episode advocates the concept of inner beauty through the Mr. Garrison subplot, and shows the boys' efforts to win Ms. Ellen's affection despite the fact that she is a lesbian. Natasha Henstridge makes a guest appearances as Ms. Ellen, marking the first time a celebrity guest played a major role in a South Park episode. She is credited as \\"The Chick from Species\\" in the opening credits. The episode marked the first time a real photographic image of a person's head (in this case David Hasselhoff) was superimposed over a cartoon body, a practice which would become common throughout the series. \\"Tom's Rhinoplasty\\" introduced the song \\"No Substitute\\", which was sung by Chef and was later included on Chef Aid: The South Park Album. Trey Parker and Matt Stone said they were initially unhappy with \\"Tom's Rhinoplasty\\" when production of the episode concluded, and were surprised when fans responded positively to it. Plot Valentine's Day approaches, and Wendy suggests to her boyfriend Stan ways to spend time together. However, when their schoolteacher Mr. Garrison decides to get a rhinoplasty, a new substitute arrives named Ms. Ellen (Natasha Henstridge) and all the boys in class find themselves inexplicably enamored with her, including Stan. Wendy becomes incredibly jealous and warns Ms. Ellen to stay away from Stan, unaware that the substitute teacher does not return Stan's affection. Concerned about the children's education, Ms. Ellen reveals she will buy dinner for the winner of a spelling test. The boys actively try to court Ms. Ellen, but Chef (having beaten them to it) warns them she is a lesbian and thus only likes other lesbians. The boys do not realise what this means and try to become lesbians in order to attract Ms. Ellen. Meanwhile, Mr. Garrison's nose job makes him a \\"hot and sexy\\" man, with his face resembling David Hasselhoff, and he decides to quit teaching to pursue women. Stan wins the dinner (much to Wendy's dismay), but finds out that Ms. Ellen has no intention of making love with him. Wendy however sees them through the window and leaves distraught. The next day, several Iraqi men burst into the classroom and declare that Ms. Ellen is actually an Iraqi fugitive. As she resists arrest, she inadvertently kills Kenny by impaling him with a sword to his face. The soldiers take her into custody and shoot her into the center of the Sun via a rocket. Mr. Garrison becomes a successful model, but he soon finds himself being chased throughout the streets by a large group of women attracted to him. Frightened by all the attention, Mr. Garrison decides to return to his normal looks. Wendy reclaims Stan as her boyfriend, and it is made clear that she encouraged the town's women to pursue Mr. Garrison so relentlessly that he decided to return to teaching. Wendy speaks with the Iraqi men in fluent Arabic and pays them with a wad of American money. Later, Wendy watches joyfully as the rocket blows up in the sun, and Kyle realizes Wendy hired the Iraqis to kill Ms. Ellen. Outraged by this, Kyle angrily confronts Wendy for this, but Wendy declares (with deranged eyes), \\"I told her: 'Don't... fuck... with... Wendy... Testaburger!'\\" Kyle looks shocked. Production Natasha Henstridge (pictured) was cast as Ms. Ellen solely because Trey Parker found her attractive in the 1995 science-fiction horror film Species \\"Tom's Rhinoplasty\\" was written and directed by South Park co- creator Trey Parker. It first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on February 11, 1998. It is considered the show's first Valentine's Day episode, since it came out three days before Valentine's Day and involved semi-romantic plot-lines. Natasha Henstridge makes a guest appearance as substitute teacher Ms. Ellen. Following the success of \\"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo\\", a large number of celebrities started contacting Comedy Central with the hopes of making guest appearances in South Park episodes, allowing Parker and fellow co-creator Matt Stone to practically take their pick of guest stars. Parker asked for Henstridge solely because he found her attractive in Species, the 1995 science fiction horror film in which she starred. Henstridge was nervous performing the role because she had never conducted a voice over performance before. Henstridge was credited as \\"The Chick from Species\\" in the opening credits. \\"Tom's Rhinoplasty\\" marked the first time a real photographic image of a person's head (in this case David Hasselhoff) was superimposed over a cartoon body, a practice which would become common throughout the series. Parker said the technology was not previously available in the earliest episodes of the series. Comedy Central was required to pay royalties to the photographer of the picture used for Hasselhoff's head, but was not required to pay Hasselhoff himself. \\"Tom's Rhinoplasty\\" displayed noticeable differences South Park's animation, which was gradually changing throughout the first season and settling into the defined look the series has maintained throughout the years. One of the exterior scenes in \\"Tom's Rhinoplasty\\" featured the first perspective angle of a street, which were previously only shown sideways or straight angles. Additionally, the simulated rain during a scene with Wendy watching Ms. Ellen and Stan from outside a restaurant was far more sophisticated than any such animation in previous episodes. Chef sings a song called \\"No Substitute\\" to Ms. Ellen in an attempt to woo her. The brief song was later expanded and included in Chef Aid: The South Park Album, a South Park soundtrack released in 1998. \\"No Substitute\\" was performed by Isaac Hayes and was written by Parker, Stone and Bruce Howell, a South Park composer and producer. During one montage scene in \\"Tom's Rhinoplasty\\", a jealous Wendy recalls memories of her relationship with Stan while a sad song plays in the background. The song is performed by actress Courtney Ford, who appeared as an extra in the 1998 comedy film BASEketball, which starred Parker and Stone. Like Henstridge, Parker asked Ford to appear in the episode because he found her attractive. The Indigo Girls-style song in \\"Tom's Rhinoplasty\\" was written and sung by Toddy Walters, who played protagonist Polly Pry in Trey Parker's 1996 film, Cannibal! The Musical. The song is called \\"I Love Domestic Chores\\", and was written \\"as sort of a lesbian anthem\\". South Park co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone wrote \\"Tom's Rhinoplasty\\" During one scene, Wendy tells Stan that she smelled Ms. Ellen taking a \\"smelly dump\\" in the bathroom in an attempt to make him less attracted to her. In the original script, Wendy originally told Stan that she had a yeast infection, but Comedy Central censors made Parker and Stone change the line. Parker and Stone said although the network typically provides great leniency in permitting obscene jokes, they often object to lines about female hygiene problems. During a cafeteria scene, a boy visible at a lunch table in the background looks exactly like Craig Tucker, but the color of his hat has been changed to make him appear to be a different character. The idea of Ms. Ellen taking one of the children to dinner came from Parker's real-life experiences. At his school, the children were able to have lunch with the teacher and principal if they were awarded \\"Student of the Week\\". Parker said he went on one of the lunches once and found the experience \\"really, really creepy\\" because he had the impression the teacher and principal were having a romantic affair. Parker and Stone had trouble deciding how to end \\"Tom's Rhinoplasty\\" in a way that would bring everything back to normal in South Park. Originally, the episode ended with Ms. Ellen being taken away by the Iraqi soldiers, leaving the impression that she was in fact an Iraqi fugitive. They ultimately decided this was a poor way to end the show, so they recast the ending to make Ms. Ellen an innocent woman who was framed by Wendy. Parker and Stone also struggled with how to make Mr. Garrison decide he wanted his old nose back. It was only a few days before the episode aired that these final decisions about the ending were made. Theme Describing the general tone of the show, Teri Fitsell of The New Zealand Herald explains that \\"South Park is a vicious social satire that works by spotlighting not the immorality of these kids but their amorality, and contrasting it with the conniving hypocrisy of the adults who surround them.\\" The humor of the show comes from the disparity between the cute appearance of the characters and their crude behavior. However, Parker and Stone said in an early interview that the show's language is realistic. \\"There are so many shows where little kids are good and sweet, and it's just not real ... Don't people remember what they were like in third grade? We were little bastards.\\" \\"Tom's Rhinoplasty\\" in general advocates the concept of inner beauty by showing how miserable Mr. Garrison becomes after having his nose job; as a model, he becomes a burnout and heroin addict who only finds happiness once he sheds his new outer image and becomes his old self. The episode also demonstrates the lack of understanding many have about the gay community by portraying the characters as seeking to become lesbians in order to win Ms. Ellen's affection, even though they do not know what a lesbian is. Cultural references and impact David Hasselhoff was the first celebrity whose head was used on the body of an animated South Park character. After Mr. Garrison gets a nose job, his face resembles that of David Hasselhoff, the actor and singer best known for the series Knight Rider and Baywatch. Mr. Garrison refers disparagingly to the 1997 science fiction drama film Contact. Parker and Stone said they went out of their way to include the reference due to their own strong distaste for the film. The song that plays when Mr. Garrison strolls down the street after his nose job is \\"Shadow Dancing\\" by Andy Gibb. When Chef tries to determine how attractive Ms. Ellen is, he asks the boys how she compares various celebrities, including Vanessa L. Williams, Toni Braxton, Pamela Anderson, and Erin Gray. For the latter actress, he specifically asks if Ms. Ellen is as attractive as Gray was in the second season of the NBC series, Buck Rogers in the 25th Century. When Ms. Ellen asks the class about the last lesson Mr. Garrison taught them, Cartman said they had been learning about how actress Yasmine Bleeth was dating Richard Grieco, the star of television series 21 Jump Street and Booker. The store Tom's Rhinoplasty first appeared in the background of the short Jesus vs. Santa; it is regularly shown in the background throughout the rest of the series, as well as in the 1999 South Park film, South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut. A South Park drinking game included in the book \\"The Complete Guide to Television and Movie Drinking\\" encourages viewers to drink whenever South Park residents walk by or gather in front of the Tom's Rhinoplasty building. Release and reception When production of \\"Tom's Rhinoplasty\\" ended, Parker and Stone were dissatisfied with the final product and believed audiences would hate it, but were surprised to receive largely positive feedback from fans, some of whom described it as their favorite of the latter half of the season. \\"Tom's Rhinoplasty\\" has been described as one of the classic episodes of South Park. In 2003, the Chicago Tribune listed it among the top 10 episodes of the series. Walt Belcher of The Tampa Tribune praised the episode and said it \\"celebrates Valentine's Day [as] only the Comedy Central series can\\", although he warned it was not for children. During a brief scene in \\"Tom's Rhinoplasty\\", Mr. Garrison leans against a mailbox with a United States Postal Service logo printed on the side. The Postal Service contacted Comedy Central after the episode aired and threatened legal action if the logo was used again without permission. \\"Tom's Rhinoplasty\\" was released, along with 11 other episodes, in a three-disc DVD set in November 1998. It was included in the third volume, which also included the episodes \\"Starvin' Marvin\\", \\"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo\\" and \\"Mecha-Streisand\\". The DVD commentary recorded by Parker and Stone for \\"Tom's Rhinoplasty\\" has been cited as one of the primary reasons the commentaries were not included in the South Park Season One DVD release. Warner Bros., which released the DVD set, refused to include the commentaries due to \\"standards\\" issues with some of the statements unless Parker and Stone allowed the tracks to be edited, which they refused. Media outlets said the commentary that most bothered Warner Bros. executives was the one for \\"Tom's Rhinoplasty\\", in which Parker and Stone say they agree with Mr. Garrison's character that the 1997 film Contact (also released by Warner Bros.) was \\"terrible\\". The commentaries were ultimately released on CD separately from the DVDs.

A bulla was worn around the neck as a locket to protect against evil spirits and forces. Bullae were made of differing substances depending upon the wealth of the family. =Roman boys= Before the age of manhood, Roman boys wore a bulla, a neckchain and round pouch containing protective amulets (usually phallic symbols), and the bulla of an upper-class boy would be made of gold. Other materials included leather and cloth. A freeborn Roman boy wore a bulla until he came of age as a Roman citizen.

Some modern sources interpret Macrobius's single reference to an amulet worn by a triumphal general during his procession as evidence that the childhood bulla was also a standard item of triumphal regalia.Beard, Mary: The Roman Triumph, The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Mass., and London, England, 2007, pp. 229-230, 375-376, note 29; citing see also Macrobius, 3. 6. 9. =Roman girls= A girl child did not wear a bulla per se, but another kind of amulet, called a lunula, until the eve of her marriage, when it was removed along with her childhood toys and other things.

Bronze Age Ireland A small number of bullae have been found in Ireland; they are called \\"bullae\\" based on their resemblance to the Roman form.Other than superficial resemblance, Irish and Roman bullae have no known connection. The Irish bullae so far found were made of base metalIrish bullae are usually made of lead, but also tin. Bullae made of clay are rare. ‚Äì sometimes clay ‚Äì covered with a folded over piece of gold foil. The Irish bullae date to the Late Bronze Age, about 1150‚Äì750 BCE. They were presumably worn suspended round the neck with a cord running through the hole below the flat top. The body of the bulla has roughly vertical sides before making a semi-circle or inverted pointed arch at the bottom. The gold is incised with geometrical decoration. Whether they were purely for adornment or had an amuletic or other function is unclear. Despite the small weight of gold used they would have been available only for elite groups.

Part of a set of five piano pieces entitled Morceaux de fantaisie, it is a 62-bar prelude in ternary (ABA) form. It is also known as The Bells of Moscow since the introduction seems to reproduce the Kremlin's most solemn carillon chimes. Its first performance was by the composer on 26 September 1892, at a festival called the Moscow Electrical Exhibition. After this premi√®re, a review of the concert singled out the Prelude, noting that it had ‚Äúaroused enthusiasm‚Äù. From this point on, its popularity grew. Rachmaninoff later published 23 more preludes to complete a set of 24 preludes covering all the major and minor keys, to emulate earlier sets by Bach, Chopin, Alkan, Scriabin and others.  Background  This work was one of the first the 19‚Äëyear‚Äëold Rachmaninoff composed as a \\"Free Artist\\", after he graduated from the Moscow Conservatory on 29 May 1892. He performed this new work for the first time at one of the concerts of the Moscow Electrical Exhibition on 26 September 1892. It was printed the following year as the second of five Morceaux de fantaisie (Op. 3), all dedicated to Anton Arensky, his harmony teacher at the Conservatory. Because at the time Russia was not party to the 1886 Berne Convention, Russian publishers did not pay royalties, so the only financial return he ever received for this piece was a 40 ruble (about two months' wage of a factory worker) publishing fee.  Composition  The prelude is organized into three main parts and a coda: * The piece opens with a three-note motif at fortissimo which introduces the grim C-sharp minor tonality that dominates the piece. The cadential motif repeats throughout. In the third bar, the volume changes to a piano pianissimo for the exposition of the theme. * The second part is propulsive and marked Agitato (agitated), beginning with highly chromatic triplets. This passionately builds to interlocking chordal triplets that descend into a climactic recapitulation of the main theme, this time in four staves to accommodate the volume of notes. Certain chords in the section are marked with quadruple sforzando. * The piece closes with a brief seven-bar coda which ends quietly.  Reception  The prelude became one of Rachmaninoff's most famous compositions. His cousin Alexander Siloti was instrumental in securing the Prelude's success throughout the Western world. In the autumn of 1898, he made a tour of Western Europe and the United States, with a program that contained the Prelude. Soon after, London publishers brought out several editions with titles such as The Burning of Moscow, The Day of Judgement, and The Moscow Waltz. America followed suit with other titles (such as The Bells of Moscow). It was so popular that it was referred to as \\"The Prelude\\" and audiences would demand it as an encore at his performances, shouting \\"C-sharp!\\" Because of this, Rachmaninoff grew very tired of it and once said, \\"Many, many times I wish I had never written it.\\" Rachmaninoff recorded the piece electrically, on Welte-Mignon reproducing pianos, and on Ampico piano rolls. The prelude has been arranged for orchestra in several versions. It has been used in many films, and many songs have sampled it.

He is one of the three original founders of the seminal Punk magazine that gave the movement its name; as well as being a former editor at Spin and editor-in-chief of Nerve Magazine. Punk Magazine At the age of 19, McNeil gathered with two high school friends, John Holmstrom and Ged Dunn, and decided to create \\"some sort of media thing\\" for a living. Holmstrom had an idea of combining comics with rock n roll. They settled upon a magazine, assuming that people would \\"think [they were] cool and hang out with [them]\\" as well as \\"give [them] free drinks\\", and it worked. Within days of its first publication, Punk Magazine, McNeil, Holmstrom, and Dunn were famous. The name \\"Punk\\" was decided upon because \\"it seemed to sum up...everything...obnoxious, smart but not pretentious, absurd, ironic, and things that appealed to the darker side\\". Holstrom wanted to call it \\"Teenage News Gazette\\" to which Ged said,\\"Absolutely not.\\" The name Punk was McNeil's idea; Dunn agreed to it instantly, Holmstrom rather reluctantly. Nicknamed \\"Resident Punk\\" in the magazine, McNeil claims (to much dispute) that he was the first person (along with co-founder John Holmstrom) to have coined the term \\"punk\\" to describe a certain type of music, fashion, and attitude. He says he came up with the name punk because Telly Savalas used the line \\"You lousy punk!\\" on the show Kojak. According to McNeil: \\"After four years of doing Punk magazine, and basically getting laughed at, suddenly everything was \\"punk,\\" so I quit the magazine.\\" Later work McNeil is the co-author (with Gillian McCain) of Please Kill Me: The Uncensored Oral History of Punk, which has been published in 12 languages and helped launch the oral history trend in music books. The New York Times called the book \\"lurid, insolent, disorderly, funny, sometimes gross, sometimes mean and occasionally touching.\\" McNeil is also co-author of The Other Hollywood: The Uncensored Oral History of the Porn Film Industry. As Publisher‚Äôs Weekly said, ‚ÄúThis compulsively readable book perfectly captures the pop culture zeitgeist. It doesn't hurt that the history of American pornography is inextricably intertwined with all the subjects that captivate us: sex, drugs, beauty, fame, money, the Mafia, law enforcement and violence.‚Äù McNeil is also the co-author of I Slept with Joey Ramone (A Punk Rock Family Memoir) with Mickey Leigh, Joey Ramone‚Äôs real brother. McNeil‚Äôs most recent book, Dear Nobody: The True Diary of Mary Rose is another collaborative effort with Gillian McCain. Dear Nobody was published on April 1, 2014 and received widespread critical acclaim as being the authentic version of Go Ask Alice. McNeil has appeared on many TV documentaries, from the History Channel to VH1, and has produced and hosted a three-hour TV special on Court TV over three nights on the porn industry, which was the highest-rated original programming in that network‚Äôs history. In 2016, a 2014 interview with McNeil was featured in Danny Says, the biographical documentary about the influential rock music publicist, Danny Fields, appearing alongside Fields, Iggy Pop, Alice Cooper, and others.

After several failures and reorganizations, the most notable version of the league was organized by Ban Johnson on November 20, 1893. In 1900, the league was renamed the American League, and declared its major league status in 1901 against the older National League of 1876, which was centered in the American Northeast states. History Before its most notable incarnation in November 1893, the Western League existed in various forms. The League was formed as a minor league on February 11, 1885. The original clubs were located in Indianapolis‚Äö Kansas City‚Äö Cleveland‚Äö Milwaukee‚Äö Toledo and Omaha/Keokuk, Iowa. The season began on April 18, 1885 with the Indianapolis Hoosiers winning the first title with a record of 27‚Äì4‚Äì1. The league then folded on June 15, 1885. The league was reformed on January 18, 1886 to play an 80-game schedule. Denver would win the pennant on September 20, 1886 with a record of 54 wins and 26 losses. In 1887, the league was dominated by Topeka's Golden Giants, a high-priced collection of major leaguers, including Bug Holliday, Jim Conway, Perry Werden and Jimmy Macullar, which won the title by 15¬Ω games on October 2, 1887. The league returned in February 1888 but after a partial season would dissolve on June 21, 1888. Denver had finished first with a record of 18 wins and 6 losses. The league would not be heard of for over three years until it was revived in 1892. Columbus would win the title with a record of 46 wins and 26 losses. The league would shut down on July 11, 1892. The league was revived on May 17, 1893 and had planned a schedule before being shut down on June 20, 1893. =Reorganization and conversion to American League= In a meeting in Detroit, Michigan, on November 20, 1893, the Western League reorganized again. From this point forward, this version of the WL has continued in existence, eventually becoming the modern-day American League. At that meeting, Ban Johnson was elected President, and would remain so until his retirement nearly 35 years later. Johnson, a Cincinnati-based newspaper reporter, had been recommended by his friend Charles Comiskey, a former major league star with the St. Louis Browns in the 1880s, who was then managing the Cincinnati Reds. After the 1894 season, when Comiskey's contract with the Reds was up, he decided to take his chances at ownership. He bought the Sioux City team and transferred it to Saint Paul, Minnesota. These two men would be among the cornerstones of the American League. After the 1899 season, the National League announced it was dropping four of its franchises, reducing its membership from 12 to 8 teams. The franchises that were eliminated were Baltimore, Cleveland, Louisville and Washington. This afforded an opportunity for the Western circuit to expand into those vacated cities. In a meeting in Chicago on October 11, 1899, the Western League renamed itself the American League. It was still a minor league, subject to the National Agreement, and generally subordinate to the older National League of Major League Baseball, founded 1876. The NL gave permission to the new AL to put a team in Chicago that year, and Comiskey moved his St. Paul club to the South Side. However, the new team in Chicago was subject to rules from the NL. The Cubs (then called the Orphans) were allowed to draft two players each year from the AL team. Comiskey was also barred from using the name \\"Chicago\\" in all of his dealings, so he cleverly revived the old moniker \\"White Stockings\\" from the days of Cap Anson for his team. The AL also transferred the Grand Rapids team to Cleveland for the 1900 season. After the 1900 season, the American League declined to renew its membership in the \\"National Agreement\\" and declared itself a \\"major league\\". It began raiding NL team rosters and attempting to compete directly against the NL. The franchises in the smaller cities of Buffalo, Indianapolis, Kansas City and Minneapolis were replaced by the larger, more important urban centers of Baltimore, Boston, Philadelphia and Washington for the 1901 season. The second and third of those cities already had NL teams. Next, Milwaukee moved to St. Louis in 1902. Baltimore, having fallen into disarray, was replaced by New York City in 1903, for the reason that the new league would not be totally respected and have \\"major league\\" status without a team in the nation's largest city. The American League team lineup settled on five franchises in cities that already had NL teams (Boston, Chicago, New York, Philadelphia, and St. Louis) and two in cities that had been recently abandoned by the NL (Cleveland and Washington), but only one in a city remaining from the former Western League lineup of 1899 (Detroit). Four of the other 1899 Western League cities now host Major League Baseball today (Kansas City, Milwaukee, and St. Paul and Minneapolis jointly), while three do not (Buffalo, Grand Rapids, and Indianapolis, but all have minor league teams). This membership list for both leagues lasted in place for nearly a half-century until the move of the Boston Braves to Milwaukee in 1952, the St. Louis Browns to Baltimore, becoming the new Baltimore Orioles in 1954, and the Philadelphia Athletics to Kansas City in 1955. The American League's claim to major league status was disputed, but had to be recognized after the Boston Red Sox defeated the NL champion Pittsburgh Pirates in the first World Series held in late 1903. =Another Western League= When Ban Johnson changed his league's name to the American League before the 1900 season, another \\"Western League\\" was immediately formed to function on the supporting \\"minor league\\" level. This League operated from 1900 to 1937 and later from 1947 to 1958. Its franchises were located west of the Mississippi River, in the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains states, as in that early part of the 20th century, it was difficult and long-enduring for teams to go on \\"road trips\\" to distant cities by the then existing railroad passenger train systems. In its post-World War II incarnation, the later Western League included clubs in Denver, Colorado (now represented in the National League by the Colorado Rockies), Des Moines, Iowa, Omaha, Nebraska, and Colorado Springs, Colorado (now all represented by teams of the Class AAA (\\"Triple A\\") Pacific Coast League). Several other 20th century minor league circuits have also used the same name.

It is a sweep of the history of international relations and the art of diplomacy, largely concentrating on the 20th century and the Western World. Kissinger, as a great believer in the realist school of international relations, focuses strongly upon the concepts of the balance of power in Europe prior to World War I, raison d'√âtat and Realpolitik throughout the ages of diplomatic relations. Kissinger also provides insightful critiques of the counter realist diplomatic tactics of collective security, developed in the Charter of the League of Nations, and self determination, also a principle of the League. Kissinger also examines the use of the sphere of influence arguments put forth by the Soviet Union in Eastern and Southern Europe after World War II; an argument that has been maintained by contemporary Russian foreign relations with regard to Ukraine, Georgia and other former Soviet satellites in Central Asia. The history begins in Europe in the 17th century, but quickly advances up to the World Wars and then the Cold War. Kissinger refers to himself numerous times in the book, especially when recounting the Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford presidencies. Kissinger dedicated the book to the men and women of the United States Foreign Service.

Biography Lawton began his musical career in North Shields, UK, in the early '60s with The Deans, a bunch of kids who decided at random that he should be singer. He then moved on to West One and later Stonewall which included John Miles, Vic Malcolm (later of Geordie) and Paul Thompson (later of Roxy Music). After Stonewall finished their stint at Top Ten Club in Hamburg in 1969, Lawton decided to stay in Germany, after having been offered the job as singer with legendary German rock cult band Lucifer's Friend (1969‚Äì1976 and 1979‚Äì1995) with whom he recorded seven studio albums. He also joined the Les Humphries Singers, in the early '70s (which included the Eurovision Song Contest in '76). In 1976 Lawton joined Uriah Heep as their frontman, recording the albums Firefly, Innocent Victim, Fallen AngelStrong, Martin C. (2002). The Great Rock Discography, pp. 109-110. Edinburgh: Canongate Books Ltd. and Live in Europe '79, touring Europe and the U.S. until September 1979. During his longstanding career Lawton has worked with some big names of rock, on various projects, including Roger Glover's \\"Butterfly Ball\\" live at the Royal Albert Hall in 1975, featuring David Coverdale, Glenn Hughes, Ian Gillan and Twiggy. He sang on Eddie Hardin's \\"Wizard's Convention II\\" with Chris Farlowe, Denny Laine, Paul Jones and Tony Ashton. Lawton worked with some of the finest record producers, including Tony Clarke (Moody Blues), Jimmy Miller (Rolling Stones), and Harold Faltermeyer (Pet Shop Boys), who produced the titles Lawton sang on the Lenny McDowell Project \\"Lost Paradise\\". Lawton sang with German rock band Rebel, later known as Zar, on three albums, during the late '80s -'90s including their hit singles \\"Line of Fire\\" and \\"Eagles Flight\\", and moved on to Volker Barber's classical project \\"Excalibur\\". He also sang on several German commercials, including the \\"Colgate Gel\\" TV spots, the \\"Peter Stuyvesant Travel\\" spots, the Stuyvesant single \\"Come Together\\" and a stint for Harley Davidson Motorbikes. Lawton formed GunHill, later known as JLB (John Lawton Band), in January 1994, touring the UK and Europe. In 1995 he briefly rejoined Uriah Heep for 2 weeks, to tour South Africa and Austria with Deep Purple, filling in for their singer Bernie Shaw, who was suffering from voice problems at the time. Inspired by German top producer Robert Papst and his partner Reinhold Hoffman, Lawton re- recorded one of the Les Humphries Singers' favourites, the 1970s hit \\"Mama Loo\\", in January 1998. In August 2000, his solo album Still Paying My Dues to the Blues, produced by Robert Papst, was released in Europe, UK and Scandinavia, by Hypertension Music Hamburg and distributed through EDEL Germany. (The album has been re-released in 2010) During the 4th Uriah Heep Annual Convention in London, May 2000, plans were made for a one-off concert by the so-called Hensley/Lawton Band. Lawton was joined by former Heep keyboardist Ken Hensley, for the first time 21 years after Lawton's departure from Uriah Heep in 1979. With them were Paul Newton (their original bassist), and 2 members of Lawton's band Reuben Kane on lead guitar and Justin Shefford on drums. They played a collection of old Heep classics and some of Hensley & Lawton's solo songs, and the concert was recorded for a CD release called The Return. In 2001 Lawton teamed up with Ken Hensley to form the Hensley Lawton Band. After extensive touring, during Spring and Summer of 2001, culminating with a concert in Hamburg, Germany, featuring a full orchestra and a new rendition of Heep's old classic \\"Salisbury\\", both Ken and John returned to their respective solo careers. On 7 December 2001, both John Lawton and Ken Hensley appeared on stage with Uriah Heep during the annual Magician's Birthday Party at the Shepherd's Bush Empire in London. This concert was recorded and released as a CD/DVD. The John Lawton Band - \\"JLB\\" was taken on by Classic Rock Productions in 2001 to record the acoustic CD Steppin' It Up, which features John & Steve Dunning. One More Night Live at the Mean Fiddler, CD & DVD, was recorded in 2002, which was followed in 2003 by JLB's Sting in the Tale CD, an original studio rock album. Later that year followed another Live CD & DVD Shakin' The Tale. JLB had been touring extensively with their last gig in Hamburg, September 2004, when Lawton decided to take an indefinite break. In May 2006 Lawton joined forces with Dutch guitarist Jan Dum√©e (ex- Focus) to form the On The Rocks project. On The Rocks - \\"OTR\\" featured Brazilian musicians Ney Concei√ß√£o on bass, Xande Figueiredo on drums, and Marvio Ciribelli on keyboards. Lawton and Dum√©e wrote and recorded the tracks for the debut album Mamonama, released in October 2008. In September 2008 John Lawton appeared on stage at the Heepvention 2008 in Spain, with former Uriah Heep members Ken Hensley, Lee Kerslake and Paul Newton, together with Jan Dumee from the OTR project on guitar. In December 2008 John entered the world of television by presenting the Bulgarian travel documentary series \\"John Lawton presents\\" which also includes music from the Mamonama album. Made by the Bulgarian TV company \\"Skat\\", the films feature interesting historical landmarks of Bulgarian towns and cities, traditional festivities and interviews with the city mayors and local people. So far the series consists of 19 documentaries, including the municipalities of Karnobat, Sozopol, Tsarevo, Primorsko, Burgas, Smolyan, Pamporovo, Varna, Malko Tarnovo, Velingrad, Shumen, Popovo winter, Popovo spring, Chepelare, Lovech, Kavarna, Stara Zagora, Nedelino. In 2009 John again joined Ken Hensley, Lee Kerslake and Paul Newton to appear at Heepvention 2009 in Salo, Finland with a Finnish guitarist completing the line-up. In March 2010, John made his acting debut in the motion picture Love.net, filmed and produced by Bulgarian film company Miramar Film. Part of John's scenes were shot at Liscombe Park, UK, featuring a guest appearance by Uriah Heep guitarist Mick Box, with the remainder filmed in Sofia. He also recorded the movie's soundtrack song - Tonight. The film was premiered in Sofia on 26 March 2011.

The Claus process is the most significant gas desulfurizing process, recovering elemental sulfur from gaseous hydrogen sulfide. First patented in 1883 by the chemist Carl Friedrich Claus, the Claus process has become the industry standard. C. F. Claus was born in Kassel in the German State of Hessen in 1827, and studied chemistry in Marburg before he emigrated to England in 1852. Claus died in London in the year 1900.Ralf Steudel, Lorraine West, Vita of Carl Friedrich Claus - inventor of the Claus process for production of sulfur from hydrogen sulfide, online document of 2015 on the platform ResearchGate.net The multi-step Claus process recovers sulfur from the gaseous hydrogen sulfide found in raw natural gas and from the by-product gases containing hydrogen sulfide derived from refining crude oil and other industrial processes. The by-product gases mainly originate from physical and chemical gas treatment units (Selexol, Rectisol, Purisol and amine scrubbers) in refineries, natural gas processing plants and gasification or synthesis gas plants. These by-product gases may also contain hydrogen cyanide, hydrocarbons, sulfur dioxide or ammonia. Gases with an H2S content of over 25% are suitable for the recovery of sulfur in straight-through Claus plants while alternate configurations such as a split-flow set up or feed and air preheating can be used to process leaner feeds.Gas Processors Association Data Book, 10th Edition, Volume II, Section 22 Hydrogen sulfide produced, for example, in the hydro-desulfurization of refinery naphthas and other petroleum oils, is converted to sulfur in Claus plants. The reaction proceeds in two steps: :2 H2S +3 O2 ‚Üí 2 SO2 \\\\+ 2 H2O :4 H2S +2 SO2 ‚Üí 3 S2 \\\\+ 4 H2O The vast majority of the 64,000,000 tonnes of sulfur produced worldwide in 2005 was byproduct sulfur from refineries and other hydrocarbon processing plants.Sulfur production report by the United States Geological SurveyDiscussion of recovered byproduct sulfurDer Claus-Prozess.

Sulfur is used for manufacturing sulfuric acid, medicine, cosmetics, fertilizers and rubber products. Elemental sulfur is used as fertilizer and pesticide. History The process was invented by Carl Friedrich Claus, a German chemist working in England. A British patent was issued to him in 1883. The process was later significantly modified by IG Farben.Bibliographic Citation Sulfur Recovery Technology, B.G.

The Claus technology can be divided into two process steps, thermal and catalytic. =Thermal step= In the thermal step, hydrogen sulfide-laden gas reacts in a substoichiometric combustion at temperatures above 850 ¬∞C Or between 950 and 1200 ¬∞C and even hotter near the flame, as stated in Der Claus-Prozess.

The H2S content and the concentration of other combustible components (hydrocarbons or ammonia) determine the location where the feed gas is burned. Claus gases (acid gas) with no further combustible contents apart from H2S are burned in lances surrounding a central muffle by the following chemical reaction: :2 H2S + 3 O2 ‚Üí 2 SO2 \\\\+ 2 H2O (ŒîH = -518 kJ mol‚àí1) This is a strongly exothermic free-flame total oxidation of hydrogen sulfide generating sulfur dioxide that reacts away in subsequent reactions. The most important one is the Claus reaction: :2 H2S + SO2 ‚Üí 3 S + 2 H2O The overall equation is: :2 H2S + O2 ‚Üí 2 S + 2 H2O The temperature inside Claus furnace is often maintained above 1050¬∞C.Klint, B. \\"Hydrocarbon Destruction in the Claus SRU Reaction Furnace.\\" Proceedings of the Laurance Reid Gas Conditioning Conference. 2000.Rahman, Ramees K., et al. \\"Reduction in natural gas consumption in sulfur recovery units through kinetic simulation using a detailed reaction mechanism.\\" Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research (2018). This ensures BTEX (Benzene, Toluene, Ethyl benzene and Xylene) destruction which otherwise would clog downstream Claus catalyst.Rahman, Ramees K., Salisu Ibrahim, and Abhijeet Raj. \\"Oxidative destruction of monocyclic and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) contaminants in sulfur recovery units.\\" Chemical Engineering Science 155 (2016): 348-365. Gases containing ammonia, such as the gas from the refinery's sour water stripper (SWS), or hydrocarbons are converted in the burner muffle. Sufficient air is injected into the muffle for the complete combustion of all hydrocarbons and ammonia. The air to the acid gas ratio is controlled such that in total 1/3 of all hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is converted to SO2. This ensures a stoichiometric reaction for the Claus reaction in the second catalytic step (see next section below). The separation of the combustion processes ensures an accurate dosage of the required air volume needed as a function of the feed gas composition. To reduce the process gas volume or obtain higher combustion temperatures, the air requirement can also be covered by injecting pure oxygen. Several technologies utilizing high-level and low-level oxygen enrichment are available in industry, which requires the use of a special burner in the reaction furnace for this process option. Usually, 60 to 70% of the total amount of elemental sulfur produced in the process is obtained in the thermal process step. The main portion of the hot gas from the combustion chamber flows through the tube of the process gas cooler and is cooled down such that the sulfur formed in the reaction step condenses. The heat given off by the process gas and the condensation heat evolved are utilized to produce medium or low-pressure steam. The condensed sulfur is removed at the liquid outlet section of the process gas cooler. The sulfur forms in the thermal phase as highly reactive S2 diradicals which combine exclusively to the S8 allotrope: : 4 S2 ‚Üí S8 Side reactions Other chemical processes taking place in the thermal step of the Claus reaction are: * The formation of hydrogen gas: :2 H2S ‚Üí S2 \\\\+ 2 H2 (ŒîH > 0) : CH4 \\\\+ 2 H2O ‚Üí CO2 \\\\+ 4 H2 * The formation of carbonyl sulfide: : H2S + CO2 ‚Üí S=C=O + H2O * The formation of carbon disulfide: : CH4 \\\\+ 2 S2 ‚Üí S=C=S + 2 H2S =Catalytic step= The Claus reaction continues in the catalytic step with activated aluminum(III) or titanium(IV) oxide, and serves to boost the sulfur yield. More hydrogen sulfide (H2S) reacts with the SO2 formed during combustion in the reaction furnace in the Claus reaction, and results in gaseous, elemental sulfur. :2 H2S + SO2 ‚Üí 3 S + 2 H2O (ŒîH = -1165.6 kJ mol‚àí1) One suggested mechanism is that S6 and S8 desorb from the catalyst's active sites with simultaneous formation of stable cyclic elemental sulfur. The catalytic recovery of sulfur consists of three substeps: heating, catalytic reaction and cooling plus condensation. These three steps are normally repeated a maximum of three times. Where an incineration or tail-gas treatment unit (TGTU) is added downstream of the Claus plant, only two catalytic stages are usually installed. The first process step in the catalytic stage is the gas heating process. It is necessary to prevent sulfur condensation in the catalyst bed, which can lead to catalyst fouling. The required bed operating temperature in the individual catalytic stages is achieved by heating the process gas in a reheater until the desired operating bed temperature is reached. Several methods of reheating are used in industry: * Hot-gas bypass: which involves mixing the two process gas streams from the process gas cooler (cold gas) and the bypass (hot gas) from the first pass of the waste-heat boiler. * Indirect steam reheaters: the gas can also be heated with high-pressure steam in a heat exchanger. * Gas/gas exchangers: whereby the cooled gas from the process gas cooler is indirectly heated from the hot gas coming out of an upstream catalytic reactor in a gas-to-gas exchanger. * Direct-fired heaters: fired reheaters utilizing acid gas or fuel gas, which is burned substoichiometrically to avoid oxygen breakthrough which can damage Claus catalyst. The typically recommended operating temperature of the first catalyst stage is 315 ¬∞C to 330 ¬∞C (bottom bed temperature). The high temperature in the first stage also helps to hydrolyze COS and CS2, which is formed in the furnace and would not otherwise be converted in the modified Claus process. The catalytic conversion is maximized at lower temperatures, but care must be taken to ensure that each bed is operated above the dew point of sulfur. The operating temperatures of the subsequent catalytic stages are typically 240 ¬∞C for the second stage and 200 ¬∞C for the third stage (bottom bed temperatures). In the sulfur condenser, the process gas coming from the catalytic reactor is cooled to between 150 and 130 ¬∞C. The condensation heat is used to generate steam at the shell side of the condenser. Before storage, liquid sulfur streams from the process gas cooler, the sulfur condensers and from the final sulfur separator are routed to the degassing unit, where the gases (primarily H2S) dissolved in the sulfur are removed. The tail gas from the Claus process still containing combustible components and sulfur compounds (H2S, H2 and CO) is either burned in an incineration unit or further desulfurized in a downstream tail gas treatment unit. =Sub dew point Claus process= The conventional Claus process described above is limited in its conversion due to the reaction equilibrium being reached. Like all exothermic reactions, greater conversion can be achieved at lower temperatures, however as mentioned the Claus reactor must be operated above the sulfur dew point (120‚Äì150 ¬∞C) to avoid liquid sulfur physically deactivating the catalyst. To overcome this problem, the sub dew point Clauss reactors are oriented in parallel, with one operating and one spare. When one reactor has become saturated with adsorbed sulfur, the process flow is diverted to the standby reactor. The reactor is then regenerated by sending process gas that has been heated to 300‚Äì350 ¬∞C to vaporize the sulfur. This stream is sent to a condenser to recover the sulfur. Process performance Over 2.6 tons of steam will be generated for each ton of sulfur yield. The physical properties of elemental sulfur obtained in the Claus process can differ from that obtained by other processes. Sulfur is usually transported as a liquid (melting point 115 ¬∞C). In elementary sulfur viscosity increases rapidly at temperatures in excess of 160 ¬∞C due to the formation of polymeric sulfur chains. Another anomaly is found in the solubility of residual H2S in liquid sulfur as a function of temperature. Ordinarily the solubility of a gas decreases with increasing temperature but with H2S it is the opposite. This means that toxic and explosive H2S gas can build up in the headspace of any cooling liquid sulfur reservoir. The explanation for this anomaly is the endothermic reaction of sulfur with H2S to polysulfanes H2Sx.

She was a member of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly from 2001 to 2012, representing the electorate of Arafura. She was the Labor Party Deputy Chief Minister of the Northern Territory from November 2007 until February 2009, and was the highest-ranked indigenous woman in government in Australia's history. She was also the first indigenous woman to be elected to the Northern Territory Parliament. (See: List of Indigenous Australian politicians) Scrymgour, a senior minister under former Chief Minister Clare Martin, had a rapid rise within the party throughout the 2000s, and despite a reputation for outspoken views on indigenous issues, rose to become Deputy Chief Minister under Paul Henderson after the retirement of long-time deputy Syd Stirling in 2007. She had a controversial term as Education Minister under Henderson, and was shifted to the Attorney-General portfolio in February 2009, in a move widely seen as a demotion. Several days later, she resigned from Cabinet and as Deputy Chief Minister, citing \\"health reasons\\". Scrymgour remained on the Labor backbench until June 2009, when she resigned from the Labor Party over its stance on remote indigenous communities. She sat in the Legislative Assembly as an independent, and held the balance of power; Labor had held only a one-seat majority before her departure. On 4 August 2009, Scrymgour rejoined the ALP. Early life Scrymgour was born in Darwin, the capital of the Northern Territory. Her mother was a Tiwi Islander, and her father had been forcibly removed as a child from his home in Central Australia. Scrymgour attended primary and secondary school in Darwin, but initially decided against tertiary education, working in several office administration positions. She later undertook correspondence courses as a mature age student in book-keeping, accounting, administration and health economics. She subsequently served as director of the Wurli Wurlinjang Aboriginal Corporation, co-ordinated several trial community care programs around Katherine, and as Director of the Katherine West Health Board Aboriginal Corporation.Official biography Marion Scrymgour ‚Äì Member for Arafura Labor Party, accessed 26 December 2007 Scrymgour was also an active member of the Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Union, and had represented the union at the national conference of the Australian Labor Party. Early political career Scrymgour contested and won Labor preselection for the Legislative Assembly seat of Arafura, after the retirement of Maurice Rioli. The seat was considered safe for Labor, and she was re-elected with a lesser majority, due to the presence of two high-profile independent candidates on the ballot. In winning the seat, she became the first indigenous women to be elected to the Legislative Assembly. Scrymgour was promoted to the ministry under Clare Martin on 17 December 2003, as part of a reshuffle caused by the sacking of Health Minister Jane Aagaard. She was assigned the portfolios of Family and Community Services and Environment and Heritage, and in doing so, became Australia's first Aboriginal woman cabinet minister.Hawker Britton (2004) Northern Territory Government: Ministerial Reshuffle Hawker Britton Occasional Papers , January 2004 As Minister for Family and Community Services, Scrymgour was tasked with responding to the issues of substance abuse and domestic violence. She chaired a select committee into substance abuse, and was the relevant minister during the roll-out of non-sniffable Opal fuel across remote indigenous communities. She was shifted to a new portfolio after the 2005 election, being appointed Minister for Natural Resources, Environment and the Arts. After a further reshuffle in August 2007, she retained Arts and Museums, regained Family and Community Services and was made Minister for Child Protection. She also oversaw planned changes to the territory's heritage laws, which created a heritage council to protect important sites, as already exists in several states.Scrymgour, Marion (2005) New Heritage Laws to Benefit All Territorians Media release, 11 May 2005 Scrymgour developed a reputation for outspoken views on indigenous issues during her second term. She clashed with her own party on the issue of the MacArthur River Mine in 2006, and joined three other indigenous MPs in crossing the floor to oppose the mine's expansion. She made national news in late 2007 when she publicly condemned the federal government's intervention into indigenous communities, the Northern Territory National Emergency Response, labelling it \\"a vicious new McCarthyism.\\"http://ses.library.usyd.edu.au//bitstream/2123/1985/5/Scrymgour_Oration2007_Transcript.pdf Deputy Chief Minister to Independent Chief Minister Clare Martin resigned in November 2007 after having lost the support of her caucus, and was replaced by Paul Henderson. The newly elected Henderson appointed Scrymgour as his deputy, which was considered a surprise choice at the time. On 24 December 2007 Scrymgour spent several hours at the emergency department of Royal Darwin Hospital undergoing treatment for \\"an emotional and physical collapse\\".Adlam, Nigel (2007) Top pollie breaks down Northern Territory News, 26 December 2007 In January 2008 Scrymgour was appointed Acting Chief Minister of the Northern Territory while the incumbent Paul Henderson was on holiday, becoming the first Aboriginal government leader in Australian history. She served for two weeks.Adlam, Nigel (2008) Tiwi Islander makes political history news.com.au, 7 January 2008 Scrymgour had taken on the education portfolio upon her ascension to Deputy Chief Minister, but had been regularly criticised in the press for her performance, particularly after her controversial sacking of the head of the territory's Education Department in 2008. This culminated in Henderson's decision in February 2009 to remove Scrymgour from the portfolio, shifting her to the less politically difficult Attorney-General role. The following week, Scrymgour resigned from Cabinet and as Deputy Chief Minister, citing recurring problems with depression caused by the death of her father. On 1 June 2009, Scrymgour publicly opposed the Government on its announced policy of concentrating indigenous development in 20 larger communities and discouraging \\"homeland\\" or \\"outstation\\" settlement, which she labelled as insulting. She said that she realised while recovering from surgery that she had lost touch with her constituents, and that \\"I feel strongly because we have lied to Aboriginal people\\". On 4 June, after a significant degree of speculation in the media, she resigned from the Labor Party, reducing it to minority government. On 4 August 2009, after the defection of another minister, Alison Anderson, Scrymgour announced that she would rejoin the Labor Party. She retired from politics at the 2012 election. After working for the Australian Red Cross in 2013‚Äì2014, Scrymgour returned to Wurli Wurlinjang Aboriginal Corporation as its CEO. In December 2013 she was elected as Chairperson of the Aboriginal Medical Services Alliance Northern Territory. In November 2013, Scrymgour was awarded an honorary doctorate in Health Sciences by the University of Sydney, the first Aboriginal recipient of such an honour from the Faculty of Health Sciences. In March 2019 Scrymgour was appointed CEO of the Northern Land Council and became the first woman CEO of any land council in the Northern Territory.

The proximity of Mobil oil depot to Mayfair Gardens triggered the protest of the islanders. The residents demanded a relocation of the depot to a more distant area. The depot remained unmoved, but the planned development of Blocks 1, 2 and 3, together with a bus terminus and a cinema, were forced to be withdrawn. Although the results of the protests were not what the campaigners desired at the time, this was one of the main examples of a civil protest movement in Hong Kong in the mid-1980s. Actions against the government were organised by residents and social workers. The movement encouraged greater participation in newly devised District Board and resulted in more public involvement in policy formulation. The area originally intended for Blocks 1-3 is now a basketball court, a tennis court and a playground, so the estate is open to Victoria Harbour despite the existence of the newly built Container Terminal 9 and Rambler Crest which partially blocks the sea view. The oil depot has since been relocated to the west shore of the island, separated from the residential population by the geographic barrier of Tsing Yi Peak. Access Following the partial withdrawal of the development, Sai Shan Road is the only road access to the housing estate. Its bus terminus is installed at the road. Most residents on the other hand use the footbridge entrance at Ching Hong Road. Transportation Transportation Routes List =Bus= There is a bus terminus in Mayfair Gardens (Sai Shan Road) with the following routes: * 243M Mayfair Gardens - Tsuen Wan (Discovery Park) * 243P Mayfair Gardens - Tsuen Wan (Discovery Park) in the morning peak hours only They also share the bus stop(s) at Mayfair Gardens (Ching Hong Road) and/or at Ching Wai House (which is located opposite to Mayfair Gardens) with the following routes: * 41 Cheung Ching - Kowloon City Ferry * 42 Cheung Hong - Shun Lee * 42A Cheung Hang - Jordan (Wui Cheung Road) * 43 Cheung Hong - Tsuen Wan West Station * 43A Cheung Wang - Shek Lei * 43C Cheung Hong - Island Harbourview - peak hours only * 43M Kwai Fong MTR Station - Cheung Ching (Circular) * 242X **Cheung Hang to Tsim Sha Tsui (Middle Road) - morning peak hours only * 249M Tsing Yi AR Station - Mayfair Garden (Circular) * 948 Cheung On - Tin Hau in the morning and evening peak hours only * N241 Cheung Hang - Hung Hom Station (Overnight service) =Public Light Bus= Green Minibuses are also available inside or near Mayfair Gardens: Inside the estate * 88C Mayfair Gardens - Kwai Fong MTR station On Ching Hong Road * 88A Mayfair Gardens - Tam Kon Shan * 88D Tivoli Garden - Kwai Fong MTR station * 88F Rambler Crest - Tsing Yi AR Station * 405 Cheung Hang - Lai King MTR Station via Cho Yiu Chuen  Anecdote  There was an incident that a 12-year-old girl committed suicide because of the academic problem in 2008, therefore some people think that the estate is haunted.

O'Connor Jr. (December 9, 1944 ‚Äì September 1, 2006) was an American politician who was the Mayor of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania from January 3, 2006, until his death. Personal life and early career Born in the Greenfield neighborhood, and a longtime resident of Squirrel Hill, O'Connor graduated from Pittsburgh's Taylor Allderdice High School in 1962 and was inducted into their alumni hall of fame in 2011. He worked briefly as a steelworker, and then entered the restaurant business. He eventually became executive vice- president of the Pappan chain of restaurants in the Pittsburgh area. Family He and his wife, Judy Levine O'Connor, had one daughter, Heidy Garth, and two sons, Corey and Terrence, who became a Catholic priest. Corey is a politician, currently representing the same neighborhoods that his father represented on the Pittsburgh City Council. Political career O'Connor's political career began with his first election to Pittsburgh City Council in 1991. He served on the council under mayors Sophie Masloff and Tom Murphy. He challenged Murphy in the Democratic primaries for mayor in 1997 and 2001. The 2001 race was especially contentious, as there was a five-way Democratic party primary. Both O'Connor and Murphy spent more than $1 million on their respective campaigns and in the end earned around 30,000 votes each in a very close race. O'Connor lost the race by 699 votes, and conceded the race several days after the primary. In 1998, he was elected as city council president and later resigned from the city council in 2003 to work for Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell. =Mayoral election= In 2005, O'Connor did not face Tom Murphy, who decided to not seek a fourth term as mayor. O'Connor was able to raise the most money, collect many endorsements, establish the energetic and dedicated \\"Delta Team\\" led by Bob \\"Jabo\\" Jablonowski, and beat a group of challengers. Among the runners up in the May 17 Democratic primary were Bill Peduto, a member of the city council, and Michael Lamb, a County Row Office Holder. On November 8, O'Connor defeated Republican lawyer Joe Weinroth and, on January 3, 2006, he was sworn into office as mayor. =Legacy as mayor= While in office and after his death, O'Connor was widely referred to as \\"The People's Mayor.\\" A lifelong sports fan, O'Connor took office soon before the Pittsburgh Steelers' win in Super Bowl XL. During his brief tenure, O'Connor started the \\"Redd Up Pittsburgh\\" campaign. (\\"Redd up\\" is a Pittsburgh English term which means \\"to clean up\\" or \\"straighten up\\".), and strongly emphasized the positives of the city. Each month, from November 2006 to November 2007, local volunteer organization hosted a \\"Redd Up Pittsburgh\\" day in a different neighborhood to honor him. On November 17, 2006, the O'Connor family was presented with the Hall of Fame Shining Lights Award for the former mayor's \\"Redd Up Pittsburgh\\" initiative. He was the first to receive this award. Illness and death O'Connor had been in office just six months when, in early July 2006, he complained of chronic fatigue and underwent multiple tests. On July 10, 2006, O'Connor was diagnosed with primary central nervous system lymphoma, a rare brain cancer. He began intense treatment, including chemotherapy, immediately. Though the prognosis was initially good, he experienced many complications including seizures and infections. In August, his condition deteriorated. Yarone Zober, who had been recently appointed deputy mayor, served as acting mayor in his absence. During his illness, thousands of black and gold rubber bracelets, inscribed with the words \\"Bob O'Connor...Everybody's Mayor\\" and \\"The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society\\" were sold. The proceeds were earmarked to benefit The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society. On September 1, 2006, at 8:55 pm EDT, O'Connor died at UPMC Shadyside Hospital, 24 hours after being removed from life support. He was 61 years old. City Council President Luke Ravenstahl became mayor in the wake of O'Connor's death. He was sworn in at 10:36 pm EDT at the City County Building in downtown Pittsburgh. O'Connor's funeral and burial followed on September 7, 2006, at the Cathedral of Saint Paul and Calvary Cemetery, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The grave is located in the south-west area of the cemetery in the Gethsemane section, lot 6, grave 5. The GPS coordinates are N 40¬∞ 24.770 W 079¬∞ 55.838.

November 1, 2012 marked the 65th anniversary of the founding of Service (originally known as the Dominion Wildlife Service). The Canadian Wildlife Service is a Branch of the federal Department of the Environment, and has been Canada's national wildlife agency since 1947. Its core areas of responsibility are the protection and management of migratory birds, species at risk, and their nationally important habitats. Functions of the Canadian Wildlife Service include scientific, regulatory, property management, policy and financial support work. Scientific monitoring of migratory bird and species at risk population sizes and distribution, wetlands and critical habitats occurs throughout the country. Biologists also review environmental assessments, and review and issue permits under the Migratory Bird Regulations, Migratory Bird Sanctuary Regulations, Wildlife Area Regulations, and Species at Risk Act. Canadian Wildlife Service also manages 54 National Wildlife Areas and 92 Migratory Bird Sanctuaries, primarily where key waterfowl and seabird nesting and staging habitats occur. Planning includes preparing Bird Conservation Region Plans under the North American Bird Conservation Initiative, and Recovery Strategies and Management Plans under the Species at Risk Act. Canadian Wildlife Service also leads or supports international and interprovincial agreements regarding biological diversity, alien invasive species, indigenous wildlife management boards, the Canadian Wildlife Directors Committee, and the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada. Canadian Wildlife Service delivers many substantial funding programs that support other Federal Departments, Provinces and non-governmental agencies to protect and restore wildlife habitats. Those funds include Habitat Joint Ventures under the North American Waterfowl Management Plan, Interdepartmental Recovery Fund for Species at Risk, Habitat Stewardship Program for Species at Risk, Aboriginal Fund for Species At Risk, National Wetland Conservation Fund, and Species at Risk Partnerships on Agricultural Lands. Prior to 2006, Canadian Wildlife Service was also home to wildlife research and enforcement staff. Wildlife research is now a part of the Science and Technology Branch, and Enforcement is now a separate Branch. Wildlife research is predominantly waterfowl and seabird population ecology and toxicology, with a few scientists addressing reptiles, polar bears, and caribou. Enforcement perform compliance promotion, patrols, and investigations under powers from the Migratory Birds Convention Act, Canada Wildlife Act, Species at Risk Act, Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, and Wild Animal and Plant Protection and Regulation of International and Interprovincial Trade Act. Wildlife management in Canada is constitutionally a shared responsibility among the federal and provincial / territorial and aboriginal governments. Canadian Wildlife Service works closely with these governments on a wide variety of wildlife issues. The Service engages in cooperative management projects with a number of international and domestic non government agencies and funds a significant number of management and research or monitoring initiatives. Canadian Wildlife Service in 2017 had approximately 550 staff, with offices in all Canadian provinces and territories except Prince Edward Island. The organization has a regional structure, with a Pacific Region (British Columbia), Northern Region (Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut), Prairie Region (Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba), Ontario Region, Quebec Region, and Atlantic Region (New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland and Labrador). Headquarters in Ottawa/Gatineau has the largest number of staff. History CWS traces its history to the early 20th century with the decline and/or extinction of several species of migratory birds in eastern North America as a result of hunting, including the passenger pigeon. It became apparent to the federal government that the provincial responsibilities toward hunting regulation of migratory birds by various sub-national jurisdictions (provinces in Canada, states in the United States) was limited in scope. In 1916, Great Britain (for Canada) and the United States of America signed the \\"Migratory Birds Convention\\", followed by the Parliament of Canada passing the Migratory Birds Convention Act in 1917, which gave the federal government responsibility for managing migratory bird species either harmless or beneficial to man. The Convention adopted a uniform system of protection for certain species of birds which migrate between the United States and Canada, in order to assure the preservation of species including setting dates for closed seasons on migratory birds and prohibiting hunting insectivorous birds, but allowed killing of birds under permit when injurious to agriculture. The Convention was amended by the Parksville protocol (initialled by the parties in 1995) to update and improve the conservation of migratory birds and to establish a legal framework for the subsistence take of birds. Canada implemented the Protocol by enacting the revised Migratory Birds Convention Act, 1994. With the federal government's reorganization of the Department of Resources and Development, the Dominion Wildlife Service (DWS), was established in November 1947. As a part of the new Lands and Development Services Branch, it was not meant to be as much of a research organization, but a \\"development and administrative service.\\" The DWS dealt with policy and methods in the conservation and management of wildlife resources. \\"Few people in the 1940s saw wildlife from a holistic point of view. Like trees, birds, mammals, and fish were generally viewed a resources to be responsibly managed for the purpose of generating long-terms economic returns.\\" Wildlife was a national asset. By 1950 the DWS was known as the Canadian Wildlife Service (CWS). Harrison Lewis was the first head of the new service, remaining in that post until his retirement in 1952. When the CWS was founded, important research on wildlife had been undertaken through the National Museum of Canada. After 1947, CWS scientists and technicians earned recognition for research including work on migratory birds, particularly waterfowl and sea birds, in addition to barren-ground caribou and polar bears in the northern territories. Although Last Mountain Lake Bird Sanctuary in Saskatchewan was first created in 1887, many Migratory Bird Sanctuaries were established in the 1950s and 60s, and National Wildlife Areas in the 1960s and 70s. In 1973 the Canada Wildlife Act was passed, giving the federal government clear authority to undertake wildlife research, acquire lands for wildlife conservation, and deliver interpretation activities. Significant growth of the organization occurred during this period, and CWS began providing broader wildlife research and management services to National Parks. In the 1960s, 1970s and into the early 1980s, Canadian Wildlife Service produced Hinterland Who's Who, a successful series of 60-second educational public-service television clips about Canada's native wildlife. The first four black-and-white vignettes - on the beaver, the moose, the gannet, and the loon - were produced through a collaboration with the National Film Board and the CWS. The vignettes resulted in millions of pamphlets about wildlife being mailed in response to viewers' requests to CWS. Individual Canadian Wildlife Service scientists and biologists became renowned for their work in conservation. Ernie Kuyt became well known for his pioneering work on the recovery of Whooping Cranes in Wood Buffalo National Park. Ian Stirling had a long career monitoring polar bear populations and discovering the effect of climate change on arctic ice and polar bear survival. Environmental contaminants and toxicological effects on wildlife became a significant focus of research programs in the 1960s and 70s. Tony Keith, director of the National Wildlife Research Centre from 1976 to 1996, presented his work on PCBs and the environment to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). David B. Peakall contributed to the OECD's adoption of \\"Minimum Pre-market Data\\" criteria regarding common standards for regulation and approval of new pesticides. In the 1970s the Department of the Environment was created. Environmental movements of that time encouraged a move away from the protection of individual species, towards a more holistic approach of protecting various ecosystems and the species that inhabited them. With the signing of the 1974 Canada-USA Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement, more funding became available. By 1975 David Peakall as WSC Division Chief was focusing his work on persistent bioaccumulatory organochlorines such as DDT, dieldrin and PCBs. The North American Waterfowl Management Plan (1986) lead to greatly increased funding and partnerships with Ducks Unlimited Canada and the Provinces to protect and enhance upland and wetland habitats for waterfowl, primarily in the Prairie Provinces. The Canadian Environmental Protection Act (1990) and Canadian Environmental Assessment Act (1994) further supported a need for toxicological research on waterbirds and aquatic ecosystems to support regulations and development decisions. In 1976 the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada brought together experts in all taxa from across the country and began preparing lists of species at risk using criteria consistent with the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. By the late 1990s there was political support for a national endangered species law, and in 2002 the Accord for the Protection of Species At Risk in Canada was a precursor to the Species At Risk Act. In spite of these increased responsibilities and public awareness, there were deep budget cuts in the 1980s that reduced CWS budgets and reduced staff by 23%. Later austerity budgeting in 1994 lead to more restructuring and elimination of vacant positions. The Fisheries Act (1986) transferred some responsibilities for aquatic ecosystem research to the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, but Canadian Wildlife Service also retracted from servicing the National Parks, cut caribou research in the arctic, several interpretive centers opened in the early 1980s were closed by the late 1980s, and growth of the National Wildlife Areas and Migratory Bird Sanctuaries effectively ended during this period of time.  SARA and Restructuring (2002-2006)  By 2006 the Canadian Wildlife Service had been restructured, with research scientists and enforcement officers moved to other Branches of Environment Canada. Publication series and public outreach functions were discontinued, and centralized control of communications reduced the freedom and frequency of CWS staff speaking at conferences or to the media. Attempts were made to eliminate the name \\"Canadian Wildlife Service\\" to something that reflected a broader role in biodiversity conservation, and the logo of the Loon adopted in the early 1980s was banned for use in official communications. By 2010 the Canadian Wildlife Service no longer had a homepage on-line, despite still existing as an organizational unit within Environment Canada. The changes were ushered in following a dramatic shift in human and financial resources away from migratory bird research and management to the administration and implementation of the Species at Risk Act. Ongoing departmental reorganizations through this time period also impacted the Service through the creation of centralized services.

The town was then part of the Polish Prince-Bishopric of Warmia under rule of Cardinal Hosius. The Collegium Hosianum was one of the biggest Jesuit schools and one of the most important centres of Counter- Reformation in Europe and was particularly established to educate Catholic clergy of different countries. History Cardinal Stanislaus Hosius, founder of the Collegium Hosianum The first Jesuits were called to Warmia by its cardinal Hosius, in order to counter the widespread Protestant movement in Prussia and elsewhere in Central and eastern Europe. The Jesuits arrived 2 November 1564. They were strongly opposed by the largely Protestant Prussian burghers and caused a religious split in the country. Despite difficult material conditions throughout the 16th century, they quickly founded many educational establishments: gymnasium (1565), convictus nobilium - school for Polish szlachta (1565), Diocesan Seminary (1567), Papal Seminary (1578) and dormitory for poor students (1582). The 16th century foundation was designed for 20 Jesuits, but the number soon approached 80, which resulted in problems with the finances of the schools and suitable number of school-rooms. The Collegium was opened in a former Fransciscan friary. Renovation of the buildings was possible by funds given by Bishopric of Warmia. The Collegium was located in the western part of the building, convictus in the northern, and in the eastern part was located a school. In the first years the gymnasium was not very big due to lack of classrooms. There were five standard \\"classes\\" (courses) in it, of which the lowest was \\"infirma\\", and the highest was \\"rhetoric\\". To the initial problems of the schools were added boycotting by the Protestants and some fights between German and Polish students. The Collegium in Braniewo distinguished itself from the other Jesuit schools in Poland and all of Europe with a specific curriculum: from 1566 there were taught German language, mathematics, singing and dialectic apart from standard subjects. After opening of the Diocesan and Papal Seminary some theological courses were introduced, and in 1592 also philosophical courses, which was a sign of the high reputation of the school. The school was elite and the number of students was not high, fluctuating from 130 to 300. The Collegium had an international character; besides local Germans, students came from all over Europe, with the majority of Poles, since the 1580s Swedes and Ruthenians added by Antonius Possevinus. The Collegium was temporally closed in 1626 due to war of Poland with Swedish king Gustavus Adolphus (Polish-Swedish War (1625‚Äì1629)), and reopened in 1637. In 1646 Matthaeus Montanus (Matthias Bergh), a canon of Warmia, funded a new, large schoolhouse. In the years 1665-1668 the school was closed again due to destructive Swedish invasion in Prussia and Poland, Swedish Deluge. In the 18th century in the Collegium humanities, theology, mathematics and Greek and Hebrew languages were taught. In 1701 and later Polish Jesuits applied to Rome for changing the Collegium into full university, but without success. In 1743 they bought from the city of Braunsberg a location for a new schoolhouse, which was built in the next years. At the time of the Partitions of Poland the prince-bishopric of Warmia with Braunsberg became a part of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1772, and in 1773 the Society of Jesus was suppressed. The Prussian government turned the closed Collegium in 1780 into Gymnasium Academicum, from 1818 called Lyceum Hosianum, which in 1912 became a State Academy. In 1945 Braunsberg returned to Poland and to its Polish name Braniewo. Of the Collegium, only the ground floor walls and one of the baroque portals were still standing. The rest of the complex was reconstructed between 1960 and 1973, however. A secondary school was reinstated. The right-side corner tower, left over from before the wartime destruction is known as the \\"Pfaffenturm\\" (loosely, \\"priest tower\\") and recalls the position of the former Franciscan monastery. Today it also comprises the assembly hall of the secondary school. The moat section to the south was known as the \\"Pflaumengrund\\" (loosely, \\"plumb orchard\\"). A small open-air arena has been installed, surrounded by the moat's remaining water. Incomes Fixed incomes of the Ermland Jesuits came from their real estates, which aggregated in 1603 700 Polish z≈Çotys, in 1622 2540 z≈Çotys, in 1651 3530 z≈Çotys, in 1681 2263 z≈Çotys, in 1730 3102 z≈Çotys, in 1764 5680 z≈Çotys. To the Jesuits belonged (in different periods) villages: Stary Dw√≥r (Althof), Bleish√∂fen, Kiszpork (Christburg), Daszkowo, Dƒôbiniec, ≈Åawice (Hansdorf), Hiplau, Hirsfelde, Julianowo (Juliensh√∂he), Klajzak, Krosno (Krossen), ≈Åabuchy (Labuch), Nowa Cerkiew (Neukirchen), Petlik√≥w, Rothflies, Ruciana G√≥ra, Sank√≥w, Turznice, Wangory i Wronie. Papal Seminary Papal Seminary (Papal Alumnate) was established officially on 15 March 1581. Its founder was Antonius Possevinus. The Papal seminary served as school for the youths from Protestant countries, who after graduating went back to their countries and encouraged their recatholization. Many alumni after graduating came first to Wilno to study philosophy and theology in Jesuit University of Wilno. In the 16th century the number of alumni fluctuated from 23 to 40. In 1586 the Swedish College was established as an autonomous part of the Papal Seminary. John Drews, rector of the Papal seminary at the end of the 17th century, built a new building with fancy garden and fountains. Diocesan Seminary Diocesan Seminary served as a seminary for the Bishopric of Warmia. It was funded by Stanislaus Hosius in 1567 and opened on 25 November 1567. In the 16th century it had from 17 to 24 alumni. Diocesan seminary was directed by a rector of the collegium and by a prefect (lat. praefectus), called later a regens, who was responsible for its students. The Seminary was located in the building of the Priestly Fraternity. Novitiate The novitiate of the Polish Province of Society of Jesus was opened in Braunsberg in 1568. The first person who entered the novitiate was Micha≈Ç Cha≈Çkowski, whose examination took place in Braunsberg on 15 June 1569. In the years 1569-1575 126 people applied for admission to the Polish Province of Jesuits, mainly Polish nobles. The first master of novices was Robert Abercromby. The novitiate was located at first in the building of the collegium, then in the old building of the convictus. In 1586 the novitate was moved from Braniewo to Krak√≥w.

Romberg was born in Vechta, in the Duchy of Oldenburg. He learned the violin from his musician father Gerhard Heinrich Romberg and first performed in public at the age of six. In addition to touring Europe, Romberg also joined the M√ºnster Court Orchestra. Cellist and composer Bernhard Romberg was his cousin. He joined the court orchestra of the Prince Elector in Bonn (conducted by the Kapellmeister Andrea Luchesi) in 1790, where he met the young Beethoven. He moved to Hamburg in 1793 due to wartime upheavals and joined the Hamburg Opera Orchestra. Romberg's first opera, 'Der Rabe', premiered there in 1794. He also composed his own setting of Messiah (Der Messias). After a time in Paris, Andreas settled in Hamburg where he became a central figure in the city's musical life. In 1815 he succeeded Louis Spohr as music director at the court of the Duke, in Gotha, Thuringia. He died there on 10 November 1821. Selected works Among his compositions are: * String Quartets, Op. 1 * Violin Concerto No. 1 in E op. 3 * 3 Concertant Duos for 2 Violins, Op.4 * Symphony No. 1 in E flat op. 6 * Violin Concerto No. 2 in C op. 8 * Symphony No. 2 in D op. 22 * String Quintet, Op.23 * 3 String Quartets, Op.30 * Symphony in C op. 33 * 3 Flute Quintets, Op. 41 * Was bleibet und was schwindet, Op.42 * Violin Concerto No. 3 in d minor op. 46 * Violin Concerto No. 4 in G op. 50 * Sinfonia alla turca [No. 4] in C op. 51 * Te Deum Laudamus, Op.55 * 3 Concertant Duos for 2 Violins, Op.56 * Psalmodie, Op.65 * Dixit Dominus * 3 Violin Sonatas Further reading *, 1821.

It is a marine reptile, belonging to the family Cheloniidae. The average loggerhead measures around in carapace length when fully grown. The adult loggerhead sea turtle weighs approximately , with the largest specimens weighing in at more than . The skin ranges from yellow to brown in color, and the shell is typically reddish brown. No external differences in sex are seen until the turtle becomes an adult, the most obvious difference being the adult males have thicker tails and shorter plastrons (lower shells) than the females. The loggerhead sea turtle is found in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, as well as the Mediterranean Sea. It spends most of its life in saltwater and estuarine habitats, with females briefly coming ashore to lay eggs. The loggerhead sea turtle has a low reproductive rate; females lay an average of four egg clutches and then become quiescent, producing no eggs for two to three years. The loggerhead reaches sexual maturity within 17‚Äì33 years and has a lifespan of 47‚Äì67 years. The loggerhead sea turtle is omnivorous, feeding mainly on bottom-dwelling invertebrates. Its large and powerful jaws serve as an effective tool for dismantling its prey. Young loggerheads are exploited by numerous predators; the eggs are especially vulnerable to terrestrial organisms. Once the turtles reach adulthood, their formidable size limits predation to large marine animals, such as sharks. The loggerhead sea turtle is considered a vulnerable species by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. In total, 9 distinct population segments are under the protection of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, with 4 population segments classified as \\"threatened\\" and 5 classified as \\"endangered\\" Commercial trade of loggerheads or derived products is prohibited by CITES Appendix I. Untended fishing gear is responsible for many loggerhead deaths. The greatest threat is loss of nesting habitat due to coastal development, predation of nests, and human disturbances (such as coastal lighting and housing developments) that cause disorientations during the emergence of hatchlings. Turtles may also suffocate if they are trapped in fishing trawls. Turtle excluder devices have been implemented in efforts to reduce mortality by providing an escape route for the turtles. Loss of suitable nesting beaches and the introduction of exotic predators have also taken a toll on loggerhead populations. Efforts to restore their numbers will require international cooperation, since the turtles roam vast areas of ocean and critical nesting beaches are scattered across several countries. Description The carapace of this loggerhead is reddish brown; five vertebral scutes run down the turtle's midline bordered by five pairs of costal scutes. The loggerhead sea turtle is the world's largest hard-shelled turtle, slightly larger at average and maximum mature weights than the green sea turtle and the Galapagos tortoise. It is also the world's second largest extant turtle after the leatherback sea turtle. Adults have an average weight range of , averaging about , and a straight-line carapace length range of . The maximum reported weight is and the maximum (presumed total) length is . The head and carapace (upper shell) range from a yellow-orange to a reddish brown, while the plastron (underside) is typically pale yellow. The turtle's neck and sides are brown on the tops and yellow on the sides and bottom. The turtle's shell is divided into two sections: carapace and plastron. The carapace is further divided into large plates, or scutes. Typically, 11 or 12 pairs of marginal scutes rim the carapace. Five vertebral scutes run down the carapace's midline, while five pairs of costal scutes border them. The nuchal scute is located at the base of the head. The carapace connects to the plastron by three pairs of inframarginal scutes forming the bridge of the shell. The plastron features paired gular, humeral, pectoral, abdominal, femoral, and anal scutes. The shell serves as external armor, although loggerhead sea turtles cannot retract their heads or flippers into their shells. Sexual dimorphism of the loggerhead sea turtle is only apparent in adults. Adult males have longer tails and claws than females. The males' plastrons are shorter than the females', presumably to accommodate the males' larger tails. The carapaces of males are wider and less domed than the females', and males typically have wider heads than females. The sex of juveniles and subadults cannot be determined through external anatomy, but can be observed through dissection, laparoscopy (an operation performed on the abdomen), histological examination (cell anatomy), and radioimmunological assays (immune study dealing with radiolabeling). Lachrymal glands located behind each eye allow the loggerhead to maintain osmotic balance by eliminating the excess salt obtained from ingesting ocean water. On land, the excretion of excess salt gives the false impression that the turtle is crying. The urea content is high in Caretta caretta tears. The skull is most easily distinguished from other sea turtles by having maxillae that meet in the mid- line of the palate. The portion of skull behind the eyes is also relatively large and bulbous due to the extensive jaw muscles. Distribution Range of the loggerhead sea turtle The loggerhead sea turtle has a cosmopolitan distribution, nesting over the broadest geographical range of any sea turtle. It inhabits the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans and the Mediterranean Sea. In the Atlantic Ocean, the greatest concentration of loggerheads is along the southeastern coast of North America and in the Gulf of Mexico. Very few loggerheads are found along the European and African coastlines. Florida is the most popular nesting site, with more than 67,000 nests built per year. Nesting extends as far north as Virginia, as far south as Brazil, and as far east as the Cape Verde Islands. The Cape Verde Islands are the only significant nesting site on the eastern side of the Atlantic. Loggerheads found in the Atlantic Ocean feed from Canada to Brazil. In the Indian Ocean, loggerheads feed along the coastlines of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and in the Arabian Sea. Along the African coastline, loggerheads nest from Mozambique's Bazaruto Archipelago to South Africa's St Lucia estuary. The largest Indian Ocean nesting site is Oman, on the Arabian Peninsula, which hosts around 15,000 nests, giving it the second largest nesting population of loggerheads in the world. Western Australia is another notable nesting area, with 1,000‚Äì2,000 nests per year. Pacific loggerheads live in temperate to tropical regions. They forage in the East China Sea, the southwestern Pacific, and along the Baja California Peninsula. Eastern Australia and Japan are the major nesting areas, with the Great Barrier Reef deemed an important nesting area.C.Michael Hogan. 2011. Coral Sea. Encyclopedia of Earth. Eds. P. Saundry & C.J.Cleveland. National Council for Science and the Environment. Washington DC Pacific loggerheads occasionally nest in Vanuatu and Tokelau. Yakushima Island is the most important site, with three nesting grounds visited by 40% of all nearby loggerheads. After nesting, females often find homes in the East China Sea, while the Kuroshio Current Extension's Bifurcation region provides important juvenile foraging areas. Eastern Pacific populations are concentrated off the coast of Baja California, where upwelling provides rich feeding grounds for juvenile turtles and subadults. Nesting sites along the eastern Pacific Basin are rare. mtDNA sequence polymorphism analysis and tracking studies suggest 95% of the population along the coast of the Americas hatch on the Japanese Islands in the western Pacific. The turtles are transported by the prevailing currents across the full length of the northern Pacific, one of the longest migration routes of any marine animal. The return journey to the natal beaches in Japan has been long suspected, although the trip would cross unproductive clear water with few feeding opportunities. Evidence of a return journey came from an adult female loggerhead named Adelita, which in 1996, equipped with a satellite tracking device, made the 14,500 km (9,000 mi) trip from Mexico across the Pacific. Adelita was the first animal of any kind ever tracked across an ocean basin. The Mediterranean Sea is a nursery for juveniles, as well as a common place for adults in the spring and summer months. Almost 45% of the Mediterranean juvenile population has migrated from the Atlantic. Loggerheads feed in the Alboran Sea and the Adriatic Sea. Greece is the most popular nesting site along the Mediterranean, with more than 3,000 nests per year. Zakynthos hosts the largest Mediterranean nesting with the second one being in Kyparissia Bay.; Because of this, Greek authorities do not allow planes to take off or land at night in Zakynthos due to the nesting turtles. In addition to the Greek coast, the coastlines of Cyprus and Turkey are also common nesting sites. One record of this turtle was made in Ireland when a specimen washed ashore on Ballyhealy Beach in County Wexford. Another records one specimen being washed up on a beach in County Donegal, Ireland.https://www.donegaldaily.com/2019/03/13/rare-turtle-found-in- donegal-doing-swimmingly-in-new-aquarium-home/ Habitat Loggerhead sea turtles spend most of their lives in the open ocean and in shallow coastal waters. They rarely come ashore besides the females' brief visits to construct nests and deposit eggs. Hatchling loggerhead turtles live in floating mats of Sargassum algae. Adults and juveniles live along the continental shelf as well as in shallow coastal estuaries. In the northwestern Atlantic Ocean, age plays a factor in habitat preference. Juveniles are more frequently found in shallow estuarine habitats with limited ocean access compared to non-nesting adults. Loggerheads occupy waters with surface temperatures ranging from during non- nesting season. Temperatures from are most suitable for nesting females. Juvenile loggerheads share the Sargassum habitat with a variety of other organisms. The mats of Sargassum contain as many as 100 different species of animals on which the juveniles feed. Prey found in Sargassum mats may include barnacles, crab larvae, fish eggs, and hydrozoan colonies. Some prey, such as ants, flies, aphids, leafhoppers, and beetles, are carried by the wind to the mats. Marine mammals and commercial fishes, including tuna and mahi-mahi, also inhabit the Sargassum mats. Ecology and behavior A resting loggerhead sea turtle Loggerhead sea turtles observed in captivity and in the wild are most active during the day. In captivity, the loggerheads' daily activities are divided between swimming and resting on the bottom. While resting, they spread their forelimbs to about midstroke swimming position. They remain motionless with eyes open or half-shut and are easily alerted during this state. At night, captives sleep in the same position with their eyes tightly shut, and are slow to react. Loggerheads spend up to 85% of their day submerged, with males being the more active divers than females. The average duration of dives is 15‚Äì30 min, but they can stay submerged for up to four hours. Juvenile loggerheads and adults differ in their swimming methods. A juvenile keeps its forelimbs pressed to the side of its carapace, and propels itself by kicking with its hind limbs. As the juvenile matures, its swimming method is progressively replaced with the adult's alternating-limb method. They depend entirely on this method of swimming by one year old. Water temperature affects the sea turtle's metabolic rate. Lethargy is induced at temperatures between . The loggerhead takes on a floating, cold-stunned posture when temperatures drop to around . However, younger loggerheads are more resistant to cold and do not become stunned until temperatures drop below . The loggerheads' migration helps to prevent instances of cold-stunning. Higher water temperatures cause an increase in metabolism and heart rate. A loggerhead's body temperature increases in warmer waters more quickly than it decreases in colder water; their critical thermal maximum is currently unknown. In February 2015, a live loggerhead turtle was found floating in British Columbian waters of with extensive algal growth on its carapace. Female-female aggression, which is fairly rare in other marine vertebrates, is common among loggerheads. Ritualized aggression escalates from passive threat displays to combat. This conflict primarily occurs over access to feeding grounds. Escalation typically follows four steps. First, initial contact is stimulated by visual or tactile cues. Second, confrontation occurs, beginning with passive confrontations characterized by wide head-tail circling. They begin aggressive confrontation when one turtle ceases to circle and directly faces the other. Third, sparring occurs with turtles snapping at each other's jaws. The final stage, separation, is either mutual, with both turtles swimming away in opposite directions, or involves chasing one out of the immediate vicinity. Escalation is determined by several factors, including hormone levels, energy expenditure, expected outcome, and importance of location. At all stages, an upright tail shows willingness to escalate, while a curled tail shows willingness to submit. Because higher aggression is metabolically costly and potentially debilitating, contact is much more likely to escalate when the conflict is over access to good foraging grounds. Further aggression has also been reported in captive loggerheads. The turtles are seemingly territorial, and will fight with other loggerheads and sea turtles of different species. =Feeding= Aurelia jellyfish which loggerheads eat during migration through the open sea The loggerhead sea turtle is omnivorous, feeding mainly on bottom-dwelling invertebrates, such as gastropods, bivalves, and decapods. It has a greater list of known prey than any other sea turtle. Other food items include sponges, corals, sea pens, polychaete worms, sea anemones, cephalopods, barnacles, brachiopods, isopods, Portuguese men o' war, insects, bryozoans, sea urchins, sand dollars, sea cucumbers, starfish, fish (eggs, juveniles, and adults), hatchling turtles (including members of its own species), algae, and vascular plants. During migration through the open sea, loggerheads eat jellyfish, floating molluscs, floating egg clusters, squid, and flying fish. Loggerheads crush prey with their large and powerful jaws. Projecting scale points on the anterior margin of the forelimbs allow manipulation of the food. These points can be used as \\"pseudo-claws\\" to tear large pieces of food in the loggerhead's mouth. The loggerhead will turn its neck sideways to consume the torn food on the scale points. Inward-pointing, mucus-covered papillae found in the fore region of the loggerhead's esophagus filter out foreign bodies, such as fish hooks. The next region of the esophagus is not papillated, with numerous mucosal folds. The digestion rate in loggerheads is temperature-dependent; it increases as temperature increases. =Predators= Ocypode ceratophthalma) preying on a loggerhead hatchling in Gnaraloo, Western Australia. Ghost crabs are one of the chief causes of egg and hatchling mortality in sea turtles. The red fox is a predator of loggerhead nests in Australia. Loggerheads have numerous predators, especially early in their lives. Egg and nestling predators include ghost crabs, oligochaete worms, beetles, fly larvae, ants, flesh flies, snakes, gulls, corvids, opossums, bears, rats, armadillos, mustelids, skunks, canids, procyonids, cats, pigs, and humans. During their migration from their nests to the sea, hatchlings are preyed on by dipteran larvae, crabs, toads, lizards, snakes, seabirds such as frigatebirds, and other assorted birds and mammals. In the ocean, predators of the loggerhead juveniles include portunid crabs and various fishes, such as parrotfishes and moray eels. Adults are more rarely attacked due to their large size, but may be preyed on by large sharks, seals, and killer whales. Nesting females are attacked by flesh flies, feral dogs, and humans. Salt marsh mosquitos can also pester nesting females. In Australia, the introduction of the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) by British settlers in the 19th century led to significant reductions in loggerhead sea turtle populations. In one coastal section in eastern Australia during the 1970s, predation of turtle eggs destroyed up to 95% of all clutches laid. Aggressive efforts to destroy foxes in the 1980s and 1990s has reduced this impact; however, it is estimated that it will be the year 2020 before populations will experience complete recovery from such dramatic losses. Along the southeastern coast of the United States, the raccoon (Procyon lotor) is the most destructive predator of nesting sites. Mortality rates of nearly 100% of all clutches laid in a season have been recorded on some Florida beaches. This is attributed to an increase in raccoon populations, which have flourished in urban environments. Aggressive efforts to protect nesting sites by covering them with wire mesh has significantly reduced the impact of raccoon predation on loggerhead sea turtle eggs. On Bald Head Island in North Carolina, wire mesh screens are used on every confirmed nest to prevent excavation by resident red foxes. A new concern with the steel cage technique is interference with the normal development of the nestlings' magnetic sense due to the use of ferrous wire, which may disrupt the turtles' ability to navigate properly. Efforts are underway to find a nonmagnetic material that will prevent predators gnawing through the barrier. Up to 40% of nesting females around the world have wounds believed to come from shark attacks. =Disease and parasites= Infectious bacteria such as Pseudomonas and Salmonella attack loggerhead hatchlings and eggs. Fungi such as Penicillium infect loggerhead sea turtle nests and cloacae. Fibropapillomatosis disease caused by a form of the herpes-type virus threatens loggerheads with internal and external tumors. These tumors disrupt essential behaviors and, if on the eyes, cause permanent blindness. Trematodes of the family Spirorchiidae inhabit tissues throughout the body of the loggerhead, including vital organs, such as the heart and the brain. Trematode infection can be highly debilitating. For example, inflammatory trematode lesions can cause endocarditis and neurological disease. A nematode, Angiostoma carettae, also infects loggerheads, causing histologic lesions in the respiratory tract. More than 100 species of animals from 13 phyla, as well as 37 kinds of algae, live on loggerheads' backs. These parasitic organisms, which increase drag, offer no known benefit to the turtle, although the dulling effect of organisms on shell color may improve camouflage. In 2018, researchers from Florida State University examined 24 individual turtle carapaces and found an average of 33,000 meiofauna with one turtle having 150,000 organisms living on the shell. A collection of 7,000 nematodes from 111 genera were found on the turtles studied. Life history =Early life= Hatchling running to sea A pair of hatchlings to scale with a human hand Hatchlings range in color from light brown to almost black, lacking the adult's distinct yellows and reds. Upon hatching, they measure about and weigh about . The eggs are typically laid on the beach in an area above the high-tide line. The eggs are laid near the water so the hatchlings can return to the sea. The loggerhead's sex is dictated by the temperature of the underground nest. Incubation temperatures generally range from 26‚Äì32 ¬∞C (79‚Äì90 ¬∞F). Sea turtle eggs kept at a constant incubating temperature of 32 ¬∞C become females. Eggs incubating at 28 ¬∞C become males. An incubation temperature of 30 ¬∞C results in an equal ratio of male to female hatchlings. Hatchlings from eggs in the middle of the clutch tend to be the largest, grow the fastest, and be the most active during the first few days of sea life. After incubating for around 80 days, hatchlings dig through the sand to the surface, usually at night, when darkness increases the chance of escaping predation and damage from extreme sand surface temperatures is reduced. Hatchlings enter the ocean by navigating toward the brighter horizon created by the reflection of the moon and starlight off the water's surface. Hatchlings can lose up to 20% of their body mass due to evaporation of water as they journey from nest to ocean. They initially use the undertow to push them five to 10 m away from the shore. Once in the ocean, they swim for about 20 hours, taking them far offshore. An iron compound, magnetite, in their brains allows the turtles to perceive the Earth's magnetic field, for navigation. Many hatchlings use Sargassum in the open ocean as protection until they reach . Hatchling loggerheads live in this pelagic environment until they reach juvenile age, and then they migrate to nearshore waters. =Maturation= A mature loggerhead sea turtle When ocean waters cool, loggerheads must migrate to warmer areas or hibernate to some degree. In the coldest months, they submerge for up to seven hours at a time, emerging for only seven minutes to breathe. Although outdone by freshwater turtles, these are among the longest recorded dives for any air-breathing marine vertebrate. During their seasonal migration, juvenile loggerheads have the ability to use both magnetic and visual cues. When both aids are available, they are used in conjunction; if one aid is not available, the other suffices. The turtles swim at about during migration. Like all marine turtles, the loggerhead prepares for reproduction in its foraging area. This takes place several years before the loggerhead migrates to a mating area. Female loggerheads first reproduce at ages 28‚Äì33 in Southeastern United States and Australia, and at ages 17‚Äì30 in South Africa. Age at first reproduction in the Mediterranean, Oman, Japan, and Brazil are unknown. Nesting loggerheads have a straight carapace length of . Because of the large range, carapace length is not a reliable indicator of sexual maturity. Their estimated maximum lifespan is 47‚Äì67 years in the wild. =Reproduction= Loggerhead turtle track on a beach A loggerhead sea turtle laying eggs Female loggerheads first reproduce between the ages of 17 and 33, and their mating period may last more than six weeks. They court their mates, but these behaviors have not been thoroughly examined. Male forms of courtship behavior include nuzzling, biting, and head and flipper movements. Studies suggest females produce cloacal pheromones to indicate reproductive ability. Before mating, the male approaches a female and attempts to mount her, while she resists. Next, the male and female begin to circle each other. If the male has competitors, the female may let the males struggle with each other. The winner then mounts the female; the male's curved claws usually damage the shoulders of the female's shell during this process. Other courting males bite the male while he is attempting to copulate, damaging his flippers and tail, possibly exposing bones. Such damage can cause the male to dismount and may require weeks to heal. While nesting, females produce an average of 3.9 egg clutches, and then become quiescent, producing no eggs for two to three years. Unlike other sea turtles, courtship and mating usually do not take place near the nesting beach, but rather along migration routes between feeding and breeding grounds. Recent evidence indicates ovulation in loggerheads is mating-induced. Through the act of mating, the female ovulates eggs which are fertilized by the male. This is unique, as mating-induced ovulation is rare outside of mammals. In the Northern Hemisphere, loggerheads mate from late March to early June. The nesting season is short, between May and August in the Northern Hemisphere and between October and March in the Southern Hemisphere. Loggerheads may display multiple paternity. Multiple paternity is possible due to sperm storage. The female can store sperm from multiple males in her oviducts until ovulation. A single clutch may have as many as seven fathers, each contributing sperm to a portion of the clutch. Multiple paternity and female size are positively correlated. Two hypotheses explain this correlation. One posits that males favor large females because of their perceived higher fecundity (ability to reproduce). The other states, because larger females are able to swim more quickly to mating grounds, they have longer mating periods. All sea turtles have similar basic nesting behaviors. Females return to lay eggs at intervals of 12‚Äì17 days during the nesting season, on or near the beach where they hatched. They exit the water, climb the beach, and scrape away the surface sand to form a body pit. With their hind limbs, they excavate an egg chamber in which the eggs are deposited. The females then cover the egg chamber and body pit with sand, and finally return to the sea. This process takes one to two hours, and occurs in open sand areas or on top of sand dunes, preferably near dune grasses that the females can use to camouflage the nest. The nesting area must be selected carefully because it affects characteristics such as fitness, emergence ratio, and vulnerability to nest predators. Loggerheads have an average clutch size of 112.4 eggs. Taxonomy Carl Linnaeus gave the loggerhead its first binomial name, Testudo caretta, in 1758. Thirty-five other names emerged over the following two centuries, with the combination Caretta caretta first introduced in 1873 by Leonhard Stejneger. The English common name \\"loggerhead\\" refers to the animal's large head. The loggerhead sea turtle belongs to the family Cheloniidae, which includes all extant sea turtles except the leatherback sea turtle. The subspecific classification of the loggerhead sea turtle is debated, but most authors consider it a single polymorphic species. Molecular genetics has confirmed hybridization of the loggerhead sea turtle with the Kemp's ridley sea turtle, hawksbill sea turtle, and green sea turtles. The extent of natural hybridization is not yet determined; however, second- generation hybrids have been reported, suggesting some hybrids are fertile. =Evolutionary history= Although evidence is lacking, modern sea turtles probably descended from a single common ancestor during the Cretaceous period. Like all other sea turtles except the leatherback, loggerheads are members of the ancient family Cheloniidae, and appeared about 40 million years ago. Of the six species of living Cheloniidae, loggerheads are more closely related to the Kemp's ridley sea turtle, olive ridley sea turtle, and the hawksbill turtle than they are to the flatback turtle and the green turtle. Around three million years ago, during the Pliocene epoch, Central America emerged from the sea, effectively cutting off currents between the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific Oceans. The rerouting of ocean currents led to climatic changes as the Earth entered a glacial cycle. Cold water upwelling around the Cape of Good Hope and reduction in water temperature at Cape Horn formed coldwater barriers to migrating turtles. The result was a complete isolation of the Atlantic and Pacific populations of loggerheads. During the most recent ice age, the beaches of southeastern North America were too cold for sea turtle eggs. As the Earth began to warm, loggerheads moved farther north, colonizing the northern beaches. Because of this, turtles nesting between North Carolina and northern Florida represent a different genetic population from those in southern Florida. The distinct populations of loggerheads have unique characteristics and genetic differences. For example, Mediterranean loggerheads are smaller, on average, than Atlantic Ocean loggerheads. North Atlantic and Mediterranean loggerhead sea turtles are descendants of colonizing loggerheads from Tongaland, South Africa. South African loggerhead genes are still present in these populations today. Conservation Many human activities have negative effects on loggerhead sea turtle populations. The prolonged time required for loggerheads to reach sexual maturity and the high mortality rates of eggs and young turtles from natural phenomena compound the problems of population reduction as a consequence of human activities. =Threats= Hilton Head Island Loggerhead sea turtles were once intensively hunted for their meat and eggs; consumption has decreased, however, due to worldwide legislation. Despite this, turtle meat and eggs are still consumed in countries where regulations are not strictly enforced. In Mexico, turtle eggs are a common meal; locals claim the egg is an aphrodisiac. Eating turtle eggs or meat can cause serious illness due to harmful bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens, and high levels of toxic metals that build up through bioaccumulation. The US West Coast is a critical migratory corridor for the Pacific loggerheads, in which these turtles swim across the Pacific to California's coast from breeding grounds in Japan. Important foraging habitats for juveniles in the central North Pacific have been revealed through telemetry studies. Along with these foraging habitats, high levels of bycatch from industrial-scale fisheries have been found to overlap; with drift gillnets in the past and longline fisheries presently. Many juvenile loggerheads aggregate off the coast of Baja California Sur, Mexico, where small coastal fisheries increase these turtles' mortality risk; fishers have reported catching dozens of loggerheads with bottom-set gear per day per boat. The most common commercial fishery that accidentally takes loggerheads are bottom trawls used for shrimp vessels in the Gulf of California. In 2000, between 2,600 and 6,000 loggerheads were estimated to have been killed by pelagic longlining in the Pacific. Fishing gear is the biggest threat to loggerheads in the open ocean. They often become entangled in longlines or gillnets. According to the 2009 status review of loggerheads by the Fisheries Service, drowning from entanglement in longline and gillnet fishing gear is the turtles' primary threat in the North Pacific. They also become stuck in traps, pots, trawls, and dredges. Caught in this unattended equipment, loggerheads risk serious injury or drowning. Turtle excluder devices for nets and other traps reduce the number being accidentally caught. Nearly 24,000 metric tons of plastic are dumped into the ocean each year. Turtles ingest a wide array of this floating debris, including bags, sheets, pellets, balloons and abandoned fishing line. Loggerheads may mistake the floating plastic for jellyfish, a common food item. The ingested plastic causes numerous health concerns, including intestinal blockage, reduced nutrient absorption and malnutrition, suffocation, ulcerations, or starvation. Ingested plastics release toxic compounds, including polychlorinated biphenyls, which may accumulate in internal tissues. Such toxins may lead to a thinning of eggshells, tissue damage, or deviation from natural behaviors. Artificial lighting discourages nesting and interferes with the hatchlings' ability to navigate to the water's edge. Females prefer nesting on beaches free of artificial lighting. On developed beaches, nests are often clustered around tall buildings, perhaps because they block out the man-made light sources. Loggerhead hatchlings are drawn toward the brighter area over the water which is the consequence of the reflection of moon and star light. Confused by the brighter artificial light, they navigate inland, away from the protective waters, which exposes them to dehydration and predation as the sun rises. Artificial lighting causes tens of thousands of hatchling deaths per year. Destruction and encroachment of habitat by humans is another threat to loggerhead sea turtles. Optimum nesting beaches are open-sand beaches above the high-tide line. However, beach development deprives them of suitable nesting areas, forcing them to nest closer to the surf. Urbanization often leads to the siltation of sandy beaches, decreasing their viability. Construction of docks and marinas can destroy near-shore habitats. Boat traffic and dredging degrades habitat and can also injure or kill turtles when boats collide with turtles at or near the surface. Annual variations in climatic temperatures can affect sex ratios, since loggerheads have temperature-dependent sex determination. High sand temperatures may skew gender ratios in favor of females. Nesting sites exposed to unseasonably warm temperatures over a three-year period produced 87‚Äì99% females. This raises concern over the connection between rapid global temperature changes and the possibility of population extinction. A more localized effect on gender skewing comes from the construction of tall buildings, which reduce sun exposure, lowering the average sand temperature, which results in a shift in gender ratios to favor the emergence of male turtles. Construction of new thermal power stations can raise local water temperature, which is also said to be a threat. =Conservation efforts= Loggerhead sea turtle escapes from fishing net through a turtle excluder device Since the loggerhead occupies such a broad range, successful conservation requires efforts from multiple countries. geomagnetic tag Loggerhead sea turtles are classified as vulnerable by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and are listed under Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, making international trade illegal. In the United States, the Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service classify them as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act. Loggerheads are listed as endangered under both Australia's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and Queensland's Nature Conservation Act 1992. The Convention on Migratory Species works for the conservation of loggerhead sea turtles on the Atlantic coast of Africa, as well as in the Indian Ocean and southeast Asia. Throughout Japan, the Sea Turtle Association of Japan aids in the conservation of loggerhead sea turtles. Greece's ARCHELON works for their conservation. The Marine Research Foundation works for loggerhead conservation in Oman. Annex 2 of the Specially Protected Areas and Wildlife Protocol of the Cartagena Convention, which deals with pollution that could harm marine ecosystems, also protects them. Conservation organizations worldwide have worked with the shrimp trawling industry to develop turtle exclusion devices (TEDs) to exclude even the largest turtles. TEDs are mandatory for all shrimp trawlers. In many places during the nesting season, workers and volunteers search the coastline for nests, and researchers may also go out during the evening to look for nesting females for tagging studies and gather barnacles and tissues samples. Volunteers may, if necessary, relocate the nests for protection from threats, such as high spring tides and predators, and monitor the nests daily for disturbances. After the eggs hatch, volunteers uncover and tally hatched eggs, undeveloped eggs, and dead hatchlings. Any remaining live hatchlings are released or taken to research facilities. Typically, those that lack the vitality to hatch and climb to the surface die. Symbols The loggerhead sea turtle appears on the $1000 Colombian peso coin. In the United States, the loggerhead sea turtle is the official state reptile of South Carolina and also the state saltwater reptile of Florida.

It is usually of lightweight construction and characteristically made of a synthetic material. A windbreaker often uses elastic waistbands, and/or armbands, and a zipper to allow adjustments for the current weather conditions. Regular jackets, coats, etc. may include a type of windbreaker as an interlining that can be removed when desired. Windbreakers sometimes include a hood that may be removable and/or stowable. Many windbreakers may also include large pockets on the inside or the outside which allows belongings to be covered from weather such as light wind or rain as mentioned above. Windbreakers may offer light to moderate insulating protection, more so than a sweater, but less than an overcoat. Windbreakers are primarily worn during the warmer seasons when wind or rain are expected, or as part of a layering strategy during colder seasons. Brightly colored windbreakers may also be worn by runners as protection from the weather, and as a reflective garment used for safety. A 2012 study demonstrated that adding windbreaker pants and jackets offer a lightweight but effective means of delaying hypothermia if the user is outside walking and encounters unexpected low temperatures.  Windbreaker  A alt=The term was first used by the John Rissman company of Chicago for its gabardine jackets. Windbreaker is used in the United Kingdom and certain Commonwealth countries, including Australia and India. It can also refer to any glossy synthetic material used to make clothing. Windcheater tops are also commonly known as cagoules or windbreakers in the United Kingdom.  Windcheater  The term windcheater predates the term windbreaker and was originally used to describe a sort of garment that was more akin to a pullover anorak than a modern windbreaker. Unlike windbreakers, which are waist-length, windcheaters tend to extend down to the thighs, and they lack quilting or net linings. Windcheater is also used to describe a retail item used on the beach and camping to prevent wind from disturbing social enjoyment. Normally made from cotton, nylon, canvas and recycled sails, these windbreaks tend to have three or more panels held in place with poles that slide into pockets sewn into the panel (like many tents).The poles are then hammered into the ground and a windbreak is formed.

The album was a transition from the glam rock- influenced style of previous albums to a synthpop style. Though sales were initially slow, Quiet Life was the band's first album to chart and was later certified Gold by the British Phonographic Industry for sales in excess of 100,000 copies.  Background and recording  In 1979 Japan collaborated with famed disco producer Giorgio Moroder for the stand alone single, \\"Life in Tokyo\\", which featured a dramatic stylistic shift away from the mostly guitar- driven glam rock of their first two albums into an electronic dance style, prefiguring their work on Quiet Life. However, the group did not feel that Moroder was the right choice to produce a full album.Quiet Life, BMG 2004 CD liner notes Early material for an album had been considered and dropped, including the proposed title track \\"European Son\\", which later appeared on the compilation Assemblage. The band then approached Roxy Music producer John Punter, but he was unavailable at the time and the group began to record with manager Simon Napier-Bell. However, the band learned that Punter was available later in the year and waited for him. Punter worked closely with the group and went on to produce two more albums and touring with them. Recorded in 1979 and released at the end of that year, Quiet Life was the last of the three albums the band made for the Hansa-Ariola label. The band switched to Virgin Records in 1980. However, Hansa later issued a compilation album (Assemblage) of singles and album highlights from the band's time with the label.  Content  Quiet Life has been described as one of the first albums released during the New Romantic era, though the band themselves always refuted they had any connection or involvement with the New Romantic movement. In a retrospective review of the band's work, The Quietus characterised the album as defining \\"a very European form of detached, sexually-ambiguous and thoughtful art-pop, one not too dissimilar to what the ever-prescient David Bowie had delivered two years earlier with Low\\". The album is notable for being the first album where singer David Sylvian used his newfound baritone vocal style, which became one of the band's most distinctive hallmarks. Lyrically the title track refer to problems the band was going thorough at the time, having lost their US record contract and the lack of commercial success in the UK. It has been suggested that the rest of the songs is a travelogue relating to impressions the band had gained from touring the world. The oriental sounding \\"A Foreign Place\\" was left off the album but later appeared as the b-side on the single \\"Quiet Life\\". Later in his career David Sylvian said of the album: \\"I still feel very attached to it ‚Äì unusual for me. We reached a peak with this album ‚Äì we knew what we were doing.\\"  Release  Though initially unsuccessful upon its release in the band's native UK (where it peaked at No. 72 in February 1980), the album returned to the charts in early 1982 after the commercial success of 1981's Tin Drum and the Hansa Records compilation Assemblage. It then peaked at No. 53, two years after its original release, and was eventually certified \\"Gold\\" by the BPI in 1984 for 100,000 copies sold.British Phonographic Industry online database The title track, \\"Quiet Life\\", was released as a single in Japan in 1979 and in Germany in 1980. In other countries, including the band's native UK, Hansa chose to promote the album with the standalone single \\"I Second That Emotion\\" with \\"Quiet Life\\" as the B-side. Neither single was commercially successful. Eighteen months later, in line with the band's increasing popularity and media profile, Hansa released \\"Quiet Life\\" as an A-side single in the UK and Ireland in August 1981 (with the instrumental \\"A Foreign Place\\" as the B-side). The single reached No. 19 on the UK Singles Chart, becoming Japan's first UK Top 20 hit. A second single, \\"All Tomorrow's Parties\\", was issued by Hansa in February 1983, two months after Japan had permanently disbanded, and three years after the original album release. It peaked at No. 38 in the UK.  Critical reception  While some contemporary critics dismissed Japan as Roxy Music imitators ‚Äì \\"Although [Japan] may seem full-steam ahead, seamlessly 'European' to you\\" NME's Ian Penman wrote \\"it all seems slyly Roxy Stranded to us ancients. Ferry's smoky closure accentuated and crowded into one watery fiction\\" ‚Äì the band picked up their first real support from the british music press by other critics such as Melody Maker's Steve Gett and Sounds editor Geoff Barton.Martin Power David Sylvian: The Last Romantic\\", Omnibus Press 2012, chapter 3 In its retrospective review of the band, AllMusic wrote: \\"Quiet Life is the album that transformed Japan from past-tense glam rockers into futuristic synth popsters, though they'd been leaning in that direction for a while. It's also a solid proto-New Romantic synthesizer record\\". In another retrospective review, The Quietus called it \\"an album that pushed the elegant, improbably-coiffed Sylvian into the limelight, aided and abetted by some of the band's best songs. Quiet Life deserves to be placed alongside Travelogue, Mix-Up and Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark as one of the key early British synth-based pop/rock albums\\".  Legacy  The album appears in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. The title track made an appearance as a playable cassette track in the video game Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. Track listing The band originally intended for the track listing to be 1) All Tomorrow's Parties, 2) Fall in Love with Me, 3) Alien, 4) Quiet Life, 5) The Other Side of Life, 6) Despair, 7) In Vogue, 8) Halloween, 9) A Foreign Place, and the notes in the CD cover booklet of the 2006 remastered edition suggest that the listener should try listening to the album in that order.

The point of divergence occurs in July 1863 when the Confederate States of America wins the Battle of Gettysburg and subsequently declares victory in a conflict referred to within the book as the \\"War of Independence\\" on July 4, 1864, after the surrender of the United States of America. The novel takes place in the impoverished rump United States in the mid-20th century as war looms between the Confederacy and its rival, the German Union. History takes an unexpected turn when the protagonist Hodge Backmaker, a historian, decides to travel back in time to witness the moment when the South won the war. The phrase \\"Bring the Jubilee\\" is a reference to the chorus of the popular military song \\"Marching Through Georgia\\". Setting =History= In the wake of Robert E. Lee's great victory at the Battle of Gettysburg and subsequent capture of Philadelphia, the United States was forced to recognize Confederate independence with the Treaty of Reading on July 4, 1864, which became known as Southron Independence Day. Lee succeeded Jefferson Davis to become the second Confederate President in 1865 (in reality, the Confederate Constitution set the end of Davis's term in early 1868). Although Lee tried to establish a benevolent national policy, and was able to free the slaves, his anti-imperialistic desires were thwarted by a Congress with increasingly imperialistic ambitions, which sent forces to invade Mexico and eventually conquer the whole of Latin AmericaJules Verne, in his 1895 novel Propeller Island, envisioned the (undivided) United States conquering and annexing the whole of South America before moving west to Pacific islands such as Hawaii. The Confederacy thrived as cities like Washington-Baltimore (merged from those two cities plus Alexandria) and Leesburg (formerly Mexico City) became renowned international centers of culture and learning. The Confederacy stood as one of the world's two superpowers following the German Union's decisive victory in the Emperors' War (1914‚Äì1916) in Europe (analogous to World War I). The German Union (an apparent merger of the German and Austro-Hungarian empires) spread its hold from the Baltic to the Balkans and formed an alliance with a rejuvenated Spanish Empire. To maintain the balance of power, the Confederacy purchased Alaska from Russia and allied with the British Empire. Tensions grew between the CSA and the Germans up until the 1950s, and people around the world lived under constant threat of impending war, with the defenseless United States certain to be the battleground. =Culture= The Confederacy's living standards, economic growth, political influence, and military strength are reminiscent of the post-World War II United States. Although slavery has been abolished, to a large extent because of the efforts of men such as Robert E. Lee, conditions are still poor for ethnic minorities. Immigration is encouraged nevertheless, with immigrants being made subjects (not citizens) of the Confederacy, similar to the conquered Latin American population. Suffrage is limited to males whose ancestors were Confederate citizens on July 4, 1864. Technology developed along different lines, as the internal combustion engine, incandescent light bulb, and heavier-than-air flying craft were never created. Steam-powered \\"minibiles\\" and dirigibles are the primary powered means of transportation in wealthier nations; most people still ride horses for short distances or take trains for longer trips. All communication is done by letter or telegraphs, which by this point had become a fixture in all prosperous homes in much the way that telephones had in reality, and all children learned to understand telegraphy at an early age until the act became as common and as natural as reading. In sharp contrast to the Confederacy's prosperity, the United States is depicted as a rump state trapped in perpetual recession, with unemployment and corruption rampant. The U.S. is so destitute that a transcontinental railroad is never constructed past Iowa, while the Confederacy built seven. The only community of Americans who are generally prosperous are the Mormons in the western State of Deseret, who still practice polygamy. Otherwise, only successful landowners and the few lucky winners of the highly popular national lottery are able to rise above the semi-destitute lives of average citizens; most able-bodied adults are reduced to \\"indenting\\" themselves to businesspeople in exchange for the meager economic security that such affords. U.S. citizens are more hostile to Blacks than Confederates, seeing them as a major cause of the Union's downfall, and unwanted competition over the few available jobs. Those blacks who have not left the U.S. for Africa, are constantly derided, harassed, threatened, and sometimes mass-lynched by whites. The Republican and Democratic parties have faded away; a new two party system consists of the Confederate-influenced Whigs and the ineffectual Populists. (The narrator lists William Jennings Bryan, George Norris, and Norman Thomas among the most famous Populists and describes the election of Whig Thomas E. Dewey as President in 1940.) Lastly, the U.S. military is practically nonexistent (apparently a provision of the 1864 treaty), with foreign powers frequently deploying troops unopposed across the U.S. in regions where their nationals have been attacked ‚Äî a not infrequent occurrence, as many rural areas are poorly governed and lawlessness is rampant in them; highwaymen are a constant threat to the few travelers. The long-standing economic depression has led to a rather puritanical culture favoring late marriage and few children in each family. This, combined with a ban on immigration and the emigration of ambitious young people, has resulted in an overall declining population. Plot thumbright350pxThe alternate world of Bring the Jubilee in 1952 \\\\---- The narrator of the novel is Hodgins \\"Hodge\\" McCormick Backmaker, who writes a diary of his life in our timeline, year 1877. Hodge was born in 1921 in the alternate timeline in Wappingers Falls, Dutchess County, New York. In 1938 at age 17, he travels to New York City, the largest city of the United States (and yet a backwater compared to some Confederate cities), in a desperate attempt to gain admittance to a college or university. After being robbed of his few possessions, he comes into contact with the \\"Grand Army\\", a nationalistic organization working to restore the United States to its former glory through acts of sabotage and terrorism. One of the Grand Army's operations involves counterfeiting Spanish currency, with the goal of provoking war between the Confederacy and the German Union in Spanish territories, sparing the U.S. from becoming the two superpowers' battlefield. Despite remaining critical of the organization's activities, Hodge accepts work and lodging with a Grand Army member working from a bookshop. Content to work for food and the opportunity to read at every waking hour, Hodge stays in the bookshop for six years. (Young Hodge's life is largely autobiographical of Ward Moore.) One friend he meets during this time is Consul Enfandin, an emissary of the Republic of Haiti, the only independent country south of the Mason‚ÄìDixon line, other than the Confederacy itself, located in the Western Hemisphere. Hodge leaves New York in 1944 for rural Pennsylvania, where his aspiration of becoming a historian, specializing in the war between North and South, becomes a reality when he is invited to join a co-operative society named Haggershaven. The society was founded by the children of a Confederate Major named Herbert Haggerwells, who settled after the war in the land he had helped defeat. He becomes acquainted with his recruiter Barbara Haggerwells, an emotionally disturbed research scientist on the verge of developing time travel. Many secondary characters with their own subplots are introduced during this part of the story, including some of the last few Asian-Americans alive (after a series of horrifying pogroms against their kind throughout North America) and a mysterious Spanish refugee woman who forms a love triangle with Hodge and Barbara. In 1952, the time machine has been perfected, and Hodge takes the opportunity to finally see in person the Battle of Gettysburg which was fought not far from Haggershaven. Wearing a special watch to keep track of the differences in time, he travels back in time to 1863, where he then inadvertently causes the death of Captain Herbert Haggerwells (\\"never to be Major now\\", remarks Hodge when he recognizes that the dead man was a younger version of the exalted portrait on Haggershaven's living room walls), who would have occupied Little Round Top for the South during the battle. In Hodge's timeline, Haggerwells' men held the hill so that the Confederates won the Battle of Gettysburg, paving the way for their victory over the Union in Philadelphia a year later; in the resultant timeline (our own), Union Colonel Strong Vincent's 83rd Pennsylvania Infantry and Colonel Joshua Chamberlain's 20th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment occupy the hill early on and successfully repel Confederate advances. In the novel, Hodge asserts that Little Round Top is the key to the battle, and thus the war. Hodge's actions have led to Union control of the hill, so events play out as they did in our timeline, much to the surprise of Hodge, who witnesses Pickett's Charge having a different outcome than he read about. The South loses the battle, and eventually the war. With history changed to make the world we know, Hodge discovers he is unable to return to his previous reality since the circumstances that had made the development of time travel possible have been unalterably changed: technology evolves along different lines, and Haggerwells has died before siring any descendants including Barbara, so Haggershaven and the time machine will never exist. Hodge, stranded in our timeline, hires himself out as a farmhand at the estate which would have been Haggershaven but is now owned by the Thammis family. Between 1863 and 1877 (when he is writing this story), Hodge comes to realize that the changed post- war United States is in some ways superior to the equivalent timeline in his past. He also finds it fascinating that people always talk of the Civil War rather than the War of Southron Independence, since the victors' name for the war takes precedence. However, he has an ominous feeling about the inauguration of Rutherford B. Hayes, suspecting that it will end the Reconstruction Era prematurely and weaken the cause of civil rights. Hodge then explains why he felt his story had to be written down, because he has considered the possibility of other timelines existing in parallel universes but has come to the conclusion that by preventing the future he was born in, he destroyed the only dimension where travel between them was possible. With this, the story ends abruptly in mid-sentence. An \\"editorial note\\" following the story relates how one Frederick Winter Thammis had found Hodge's diary while remodeling his house in 1953, the year the real life book came out. Frederick's father had grown up knowing Hodge as a beloved ex-servant kept on a pension after he was too old to work. The family enjoyed listening to Hodge's stories of the world he was born in, but had not thought him fully sane. Thammis junior says the story reminds him of The Wizard of Oz. Thammis notes that he has found a watch of a unique, two-dialed design with the manuscript, and ends the book by quoting from a recent history book which asks what could possibly have caused the Confederates' failure to occupy Little Round Top, \\"an error with momentous consequences\\". Reception Groff Conklin characterized the novel as \\"an important original work... richly and realistically imagine[d].\\"\\"Galaxy's 5 Star Shelf\\", Galaxy Science Fiction, February 1954, pp. 111-12 Richard A. Lupoff described it as \\"one of the most ingenious parallel world stories ever written.\\"\\"Lupoff's Book Week\\", Algol 28, 1977, p. 57. Algis Budrys, however, wrote that \\"Bring the Jubilee has always seemed a little labored to me.\\"\\"Books\\", F&SF;, October 1988, p. 35 P. Schuyler Miller similarly suggested the novel's appeal was limited, although he praised its mature, meticulously thought-out structure.\\"The Reference Library\\", Astounding Science Fiction, April 1954, pp. 144-45 The Jewish Daily Forward included Bring the Jubilee among \\"the best literary examples of alternate history.\\"The Appeal of Alternate History Aldiss and Wingrove listed it as a \\"brilliant alternate history novel\\" and noted that its \\"wit and ingenuity\\" were influential in the genre.Aldiss & Wingrove, Trillion Year Spree, Victor Gollancz, 1986, pp. 44, 315 The theme of the Confederacy winning the Civil War and becoming an independent state was not a new one, as Winston Churchill's segment of If It Had Happened Otherwise and Murray Leinster's Sidewise in Time had toyed with the idea in the 1930s. However, Moore's book was more developed and reached a slightly wider audience than those two works, and encouraged many later writers to take up the same thread. Virtually all of them, however, depicted the USA rump state as doing better than in Moore's book. MacKinlay Kantor's magazine serial novella If the South Had Won the Civil War (1960, published in book form 1961) and Harry Turtledove's The Guns of the South (1992) also include the plot element of Robert E. Lee succeeding Jefferson Davis as President of a victorious Confederacy (Kantor's book also has Lee win at Gettysburg, while Turtledove's has him aided by time travellers the year after losing the battle). Turtledove later depicted a very different version of Confederate independence in the Southern Victory series of 11 books which begins with Lee winning the war almost 9 months before the Battle of Gettysburg would have taken place, making the questions of Pickett's Charge, Little Round Top, etc., irrelevant. Newt Gingrich and some co-authors published a trilogy of books depicting in detail an alternate history in which the Confederacy wins at Gettysburg and still the Union wins the overall war (in fact, quicker than in actual history). Publication history A shorter, novella-length version of Bring the Jubilee appeared in the November 1952 issue of The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction before publication of the novel. Boucher and McComas praised the expansion for including \\"a thoroughly justified increase in background detail and depth of characterization\\"\\"Recommended Reading,\\" F&SF;, November 1953, p. 100. After the release of the original 1953 Ballantine Books edition, the novel was republished in 1965 by Four Square Science Fiction. It was reissued by Avon Books in the 1970s and by Del Rey Books in 1997.http://www.isfdb.org/cgi- bin/title.cgi?2311 In 2001, the novella was included in the anthology The Best Alternate History Stories of the 20th Century.

Its reputation stems from its community-based programs. MIND is a partnership between the English Montreal School Board (EMSB) and McGill University's Faculty of Education. The program focuses on providing critical thinking and enriched education through alternative teaching methods.  History  Founded in 1975 with 125 students from the entire PSBGM (Protestant School Board of Greater Montreal) and 7 staff, MIND was originally known simply as \\"The Alternative High School\\" and was located primarily on the third floor (with a few classes on the second floor) of the International YMCA at the corner of Parc Avenue and St. Viateur. A vote was held by the community (students, staff and parents/guardians each had one vote), and \\"MIND\\" (Moving In New Directions) was declared the new name of the school. Early community votes dealt with the use of recreational drugs at school (rejected), smoking during class (eventually banned on the third floor only), world poverty and debt (no resolution) and student apathy (a surprisingly large meeting with no real solution). Community meetings were held weekly and home group meetings were held every Monday morning. Shortly after, MIND moved to the third floor of the old High School of Montreal building on University Street, which was otherwise occupied by the arts- oriented high school F.A.C.E. Staff consisted of eight teachers including one head teacher, and approximately 133 students in grades 9-11 (secondary III-V). MIND currently has five teachers and 55 students. In 1999, MIND moved to its current location in the top floor of the Bancroft elementary school building at Mont Royal and St. Urbain, in the shadow of Mount Royal. In 2003, MIND organized its first soccer team, and was soundly trounced by all of its competitors. The team's uniforms were black and white, with no logo.

Double sided island platform on a balloon loop - Olympic Park, Sydney, Australia P1 & P4 departures P2 & P3 arrivals Maules Creek & Boggabri Coal Terminal East balloon loops A balloon loop, turning loop or reversing loop (North American) allows a rail vehicle or train to reverse direction without having to shunt or even stop. Balloon loops can be useful for passenger trains and unit freight trains such as coal trains. Balloon loops are common on tram or streetcar systems. Many streetcar and tram systems use single-ended vehicles that have doors on only one side and controls at only one end, or they haul trailers with no controls in the rear car and so must be turned at each end of the route.  History  Balloon loops were first introduced on tram and, later, metro lines. They did not commonly appear on freight railways until the 1960s, when the modernising British Rail system introduced merry-go-round (MGR) coal trains that operated from mines to power stations and back again without shunting. = Tramways = Light-rail train using the balloon loop at Lechmere station in Cambridge, Massachusetts USA in 2020 Balloon loops enable higher line capacity (faster turnaround of a larger number of trams) and allow the use of single-ended trams which have several advantages, including lower cost and more seating when doors are on one side only. However, double-ended trams also benefit from the capacity advantage of balloon loops, for example on the former Sydney tram system where loops were used from 1881 until the second-generation system's closure in 1961. Initially the Sydney system was operated by single-ended steam trams and then, from the 1890s, by double-ended electric trams. Lines were looped in the Sydney CBD and the other busiest areas of operation, such as the eastern suburbs lines, as they provided greater turn-around capacity on this very busy system. The Sydney system was the first example of a tramway system using loops and has continued to build them up to 1997 (third- generation system). Later in the 19th century, looped streetcar (tram) lines also began to appear on systems in the US and soon looped operation with single-ended streetcars became widely used on many North American streetcar systems. European systems were almost universally converted to looped operation in the early 20th century, and most also adopted single-ended trams. Loops were also used on some tramways in Asia, South America and New Zealand, as well as on some other Australian systems in addition to Sydney. Looped operation with single-ended trams is still the predominant method of tramway operation in the world, in spite of the recent construction of some new, typically smaller, stubbed systems with double-ended trams.  Examples  = Passenger = South Ferry balloon loop On a balloon loop, the station is on the balloon loop, and the platform may be either curved or straight.  Australia  * Penfield - now closed and removed * Outer Harbor - now closed and removed * Olympic Park, Sydney, Australia: platforms 1 and 4 are for boarding, 2 and 3 for alighting. * Beech Forest railway station, Victoria, Australia: single platform station on Victorian narrow gauge railway - now closed and removed. * City Loop, Melbourne, Australia: Effectively four balloon loops with five stations: Flinders Street, Southern Cross, Flagstaff, Melbourne Central and Parliament  Austria  The tram systems in Vienna, Graz, Linz and Innsbruck employ Balloon Loops  Canada  * Toronto streetcar loops  France (Paris M√©tro)  * Non-passenger loops: Porte Dauphine (line 2), Porte des Lilas (line 3bis), Porte de Clignancourt and Porte d'Orl√©ans (line 4) * Passenger loops: Nation (line 2), Charles de Gaulle ‚Äì √âtoile and Nation (line 6), Pr√© Saint-Gervais (line 7bis) * The western end of line 10 is a long loop: trains arriving at Mirabeau from Gare d'Austerlitz used to enter a loop with the following stations, √âglise d'Auteuil, Auteuil, Porte d'Auteuil (official terminus), Michel-Ange ‚Äì Molitor, Chardon Lagache and Mirabeau again, to continue eastwards. * There also are a few loops used for stabling trains, such as west of Invalides and north of Porte de la Villette.  United Kingdom  * Dungeness, Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway, Kent, England: single track, single platform for both boarding and alighting. * Merseyrail, the Wirral Line underground loop under Liverpool, England (3 stations on loop) * Ruislip Lido Railway, a miniature railway in West London, England *The Eurotunnel Shuttle uses balloon loops: since the two tracks cross over at the French end the whole line forms a figure 8 loop. This evens the wear on the train wheels. * Central station in Newcastle upon Tyne is on a loop, allowing trains from the South to arrive via the King Edward VII Bridge and return using the High Level Bridge. * Peasholm on the North Bay Railway in Scarborough, North Yorkshire has a reverse balloon loop, with the \\"neck\\" of the balloon facing the buffer stop. The loop is used to allow the locomotive to run round the train and reverse at the same time. *The first station in London (opened 1923, closed 1968) was on a balloon loop, but the present station of that name is not. * Barmouth Ferry station on the Fairbourne Railway until closure due to sand movements on the loop made the loop unprofitable however the track still exists. * Blackpool Tramway has a balloon loop at each end of the system (Starr Gate and Fleetwood) and at two intermediate points. *The Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway (now known as the London Underground's Northern line) constructed a single track balloon loop curving underneath the River Thames to serve its southern terminus of Embankment tube station, When the line was extended southwards to Morden in 1926, the loop was sealed off. *Kennington station, also on the Northern line, has a balloon loop to the south of the station to allow terminating southbound trains to reach the northbound platforms to form a return service. *The Piccadilly line has a single track balloon loop (T4 loop) under Heathrow Airport connecting in order Hatton Cross tube station, Heathrow Terminal 4 tube station, Heathrow Terminals 1, 2, 3 tube station and back to Hatton Cross tube station. United States * Newark City Subway at Penn Station and Hudson Bergen Light Rail at North Bergen in New Jersey * Paulsboro Marine Terminal, planned loop for dockside access *Formerly, the St. Louis streetcar system had several loop stations, which have left their names in city landmarks. These include the Hampton, Catalan, Wellston, and Delmar Loops. Although Delmar Boulevard now has a trolley route, it no longer features a balloon loop at either end. *Boston: **Bowdoin Station on the MBTA Blue Line in Boston has a wedge-shaped island platform inside a balloon loop. The boarding platform is long enough for only four cars, but all of the trains on the line are six cars so only the rear four can be boarded at Bowdoin. **The MBTA Green Line, in Boston and suburbs, has balloon loops at several major stations. The loop at its Lechmere station operated from 1922 until 2020, when it was closed as part of extending the line. ** Mattapan Station on the MBTA Ashmont‚ÄìMattapan High Speed Line in Boston, has trolley cars unload passengers at the platform, then uses a balloon loop to return to the same platform to load inbound passengers. * California ** Union Pacific Railroad at Truckee, California - loop to avoid needing to reverse rotary snow plows ** Judah and La Playa station is a balloon track that serves as the western terminus of the San Francisco Municipal Railway N Judah line. ** Wawona and 46th Avenue station is a in a balloon track that serves as the western terminus of the San Francisco Municipal Railway L Taraval line. ** The two terminal stations of North Hollywood Station and Chatsworth Station for the G Line Metro Bus Transit of Los Angeles, California have their platforms on a balloon loop. *New York City: ** City Hall subway station on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line in New York City is now closed, although the loop track continues to be used to turn local trains. These trains discharge and take on passengers at Brooklyn Bridge ‚Äì City Hall, one station to the north. ** South Ferry (see diagram) was a two-track subway loop station in New York City, with a sharply curved side platform for each track. Due to problems with train length and platform clearance, this station was replaced by a standard stub terminus with two tracks and an island platform (South Ferry), although the original trackage remains in use for turning trains. After the latter station was damaged in Hurricane Sandy, the former station was reopened temporarily to provide service to the ferry terminal until the repairs to the latter station were completed. ** Grand Central Terminal, New York City - stacked upper and lower level loops (lower loop has since been removed). The upper level loop track runs beyond track 38 (and a few others) to bring trains out on tracks 1, 2 (and others) on the East side Northbound. ** World Trade Center station on the PATH subway system linking New York and New Jersey. * Philadelphia: ** 13th Street (formerly Juniper Street) is the eastern terminus for the SEPTA Subway-Surface Lines in Philadelphia, and trolleys turn on a balloon loop around Philadelphia City Hall ** Fern Rock is the northern terminus for the Broad Street Line in Philadelphia, and rapid transit trains use a double-track balloon loop for turning & staging. ** Frankford and Delaware Avenue station, also known as the Northern Liberties Loop, \\"temporary terminus\\" of the Girard Avenue Trolley while the Richmond-Westmoreland Streets Loop remains out of service. Other *Various stations of the Hong Kong Tramways and MTR Light Rail * The Charleroi Pre-metro system features two balloon loops, at Beaux-Arts and Waterloo stations.In the Charleroi Pre-metro, both the Beaux- Arts and Waterloo stations have balloon loops. At Beaux-arts, trains between Sud and Anderlues (line 89, both directions) first run through the station on a platformless track, take the underground balloon loop then stop at the platform leading to their destination. Waterloo station services three lines (54, 55 and 88) going to three directions, on a single island platform. Trains from Gilly station either diverge to the right and end up at the station to continue to Parc station, or diverge to the left to end up on the other end of the island platform to go towards Beaux-Arts. At the station is also a bypass so trains can run from Gilly directly to Beaux-Arts, without halting at the platform. No scheduled trains thus fully run the loop (or the bypass). * The Amsterdam, Rotterdam and The Hague tram systems have balloon loops at the end of all lines. Only Amsterdam line 5 terminus at Amstelveen Binnenhof and The Hague lines branded as Randstadrail do not have balloon loops. Across these cities there are several unused balloon loops that were in use until lines were extended or abolished. These loops however are still maintained for eventual purposes. The municipality of The Hague however plans on removing them and purchase new trams with a drivers cabine on both sides of the tram. * The Saitama New Shuttle has a balloon loop at ≈åmiya. Multiple stations on a balloon loop: * Heathrow Terminal 4 and Terminals 1,2,3 stations on the Piccadilly line of London Underground. *The LACMTA A Line has four stations on its loop through downtown Long Beach (California). *In Liverpool, England, on the Wirral Line of the Merseyrail network, trains arriving at Liverpool through the Mersey Tunnel fork left at Mann Island Junction onto a balloon loop, before reaching James Street (platform 1); they then call at deep-level platforms at , and before reaching James Street again (platform 3), then rejoin the original route at Mann Island Junction and then pass back through the Mersey tunnel. * The City Loop or Melbourne Underground Rail Loop, Melbourne, Australia, has five stations. There a four loops, one from the north east and three from the south west, on two levels. The loops are bi-directional. A connection enables one of the south east loops to be used as a circle line. There are no connections between the four loops. * In the city of Vantaa, Finland, in the Greater Helsinki area, the Keh√§rata or Ring Rail Line of Helsinki commuter rail built between an existing branch at Vantaankoski and the main line at Tikkurila opened on July 1, 2015. The line primarily serves the airport which was before only accessible by road, and new suburbs and working areas being built along the line. An existing stopping service to Vantaankoski station was replaced by a service which traverses the whole loop and returns to Helsinki, stopping twice on opposite sides of Pasila station. Five new stations were built, but the loop has a total of 22 stations, not counting Pasila or Helsinki. Roughly half of these stations are on the northbound and westbound mainlines, the loop line leaving them via diving junctions at Hiekkaharju and Huopalahti. * Rapid Metro Gurgaon in India. * Minami-K≈çen, Naka Fut≈ç, and Kita Fut≈ç stations on the Port Island Line in K≈çbe. * The Yamaman Y≈´karigaoka Line has three stations on its balloon loop: Joshidai, Ch≈´gakk≈ç, and Ino. *In Singapore, the Bukit Panjang LRT line has 7 stations from Petir to Senja on a bidirectional balloon loop emerging from Bukit Panjang station, with alternate trains plying each direction of the loop. With balloon loop: The balloon loop is past the station. Brooklyn Bridge and City Hall stations in New York City. * Bad Herrenalb, Albtalbahn, Germany: the train passes the loop before arrival * Bowling Green on New York City's IRT Lexington Avenue subway line is the southern terminus for ' service in the evenings & on weekends, with the South Ferry inner loop (see previous section) used to turn trains. * Brooklyn Bridge ‚Äì City Hall, also on New York City's IRT Lexington Avenue Line, is the southern terminus for Lexington Avenue local service (the ' trains), with the City Hall loop (see previous section) used to turn trains. * Howard Station on the CTA Red Line in Chicago uses a balloon loop to turn a northbound train back south. Because the other end of the line does not contain a loop, the wear on the wheels is evened out after two trips. *The Irish Steam Preservation Society's line at Stradbally, Co.Laois, Ireland consists of a balloon loop: trains operate from the station and back again via the loop. * 69th Street Terminal, the western terminus of the SEPTA Market‚ÄìFrankford Line in Philadelphia: westbound trains discharge passengers at the platform and go around the loop to one of two eastbound platforms to pick up passengers. * Gateway Center in Pittsburgh used to be the north/west end of the Pittsburgh Light Rail line. Westbound trains would discharge passengers at the inbound platform, then go around a loop to the outbound platform to pick up passengers. When the subway was extended in 2009-2012, the loop was removed; while the original outbound platform under Liberty Ave was left intact, the inbound platform was demolished and moved. * Kennington tube station, on the London Underground's Northern line: trains from the Charing Cross branch can terminate at Kennington and then run around a loop to return north. Trains from the Bank branch cannot use this loop. * Schwabstra√üe station on the Stuttgart S-Bahn: the loop is south of the station and completely underground * Tonnelle Avenue (HBLR station): the loop is to the west of the station.  Tram Systems  Balloon loops are used extensively on tramway systems with single-ended trams. Usually located at termini, the loop may be a single one- way track round a block. Single-ended trams have a cab at only one end and doors on one side, making them cheaper and having more space for passengers. On tram systems with double-ended trams balloon loops are not required but may still be used as they can provide greater turn-around capacity than a stub terminus; the Birmingham Corporation Tramways terminus at Rednal had a balloon loop in addition to the conventional stub tracks, providing extra capacity to handle weekend and bank holiday crowds visiting the nearby Lickey Hills. The Milan interurban tramway network, although using double-ended trams, had balloon loops at termini within the city limits so that they could be used as backup termini by the single directional trams used on urban service. In Milan, tramway depots are built as balloon loops, just as urban termini. Another example is in Potsdam, Germany. = Freight = Australia ;Queensland * Port of Brisbane -- Freight, dual gauge * Pinkenba Freight and special steam services.

A balloon loop has been constructed at Stiege to allow freight trains between Nordhausen and the power station at Silberh√ºtte (Harzgerode) to make their journeys without the locomotive having to run round. Passenger trains continue along the branch beyond Stiege to Hasselfelde where they reverse.  Iran  Has several balloon loops and triangles. New Zealand * Dargaville Branch -- Balloon loop providing access to Kirikopuni, 2 km north of the main line. This was eliminated by a bypass in 1943. * Woodville -- Balloon loop linking the Wairarapa Line and the Palmerston North - Gisborne Line so that trains running between the Wairarapa and Hawke's Bay do not have to reverse. Unlike a triangle, the balloon loop enables these trains to serve Woodville station. *Lyttelton Coal unloading rail facility. United Kingdom There are several balloon loops at power stations in the UK; these have been provided so that coal trains may unload without stopping (known as the merry-go-round system). Examples include Cottam, Didcot, Drax, Eggborough, Ferrybridge, and Ratcliffe-on-Soar. Also, the Fife Circle line between Edinburgh and the county of Fife acts like a giant balloon loop, branching off after Inverkeithing and connecting again at Kirkcaldy. Also, two London Underground lines have balloon loops; the Northern Line has one at Kennington, where trains can terminate, drive around the reversing loop, and then start again whilst others can pass through; whereas the Piccadilly Line has one serving Terminal 4 of Heathrow Airport (half of all trains use this loop to return eastwards back into London, while trains terminating at Terminal 5 must halt and reverse. United States * Louisa Generating Station -- Coal unloader, south of Muscatine, Iowa * National City, California -- Balloon Loop near San Diego Bay * San Francisco Transbay Terminal was a balloon loop for the Key System before it was abandoned * Marias Pass, Montana - balloon loop on the BNSF's Northern Transcon line. It replaced a wye at the same spot. * Donner Pass, California - there is balloon loop on either side of the pass. One is in Truckee and the other near Blue Canyon. They are primarily used to facilitate snow removal, allowing the plows and blowers to easily be returned over the pass. Other Both the French and the British terminals of the Eurotunnel Shuttle service through the Channel Tunnel consist of balloon loops, in opposite directions to even out wear on the wheels. Occasionally, balloon loops are used for reversing trains on lines with heavy grades and tight curves to equalise wear on both sides of locomotives and rollingstock. Such a balloon loop was constructed at Beech Forest on the Victorian Railways line from Colac to Crowes. Advantages Advantages of a balloon loop include: * Smooth operation * Trains can arrive in any free platform, while another train is leaving any platform. * Reversal of rolling stock helps even out wear and tear on the wheels. * Eliminates need for brake test if locomotives uncoupled to carry out run around move. Compared to stations with stub platforms, balloon loops allow: * Fewer tracks and platforms are required * Arrivals into some platforms do not block departures from other platforms * Time is not lost while drivers change ends and reset the train for the other direction * If the driver changed ends and discovers a hidden fault, then delays to trains are less likely  Disadvantages  The major disadvantage is that a balloon loop is very space consuming. Another disadvantage is that the sharp curves cause noise, as well as wear on wheels and rails. Also, if the platform is located on the curve, the gap between the platform and railcar door is a hazard. The former South Ferry station on the New York City Subway solved this problem by using gap fillers that extended out to the railcar door when the train triggered a switch on the tracks. The older station had been closed, but was reopened as a result of damage to the newer station caused by Hurricane Sandy. On systems where, for reasons of economy, the couplings are made non- reversible (e.g. by fitting the air brake pipe along one side of the car only), the use of a reversing loop will cause a proportion of the rolling stock to face the \\"wrong\\" way and it may not be possible to assemble a complete train in a depot, even if sufficient cars are on hand. This was the case on the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway (now part of the Northern line of London Underground). After the opening of a loop at Charing Cross (Embankment) in 1914 (replaced in 1926 by the present Kennington loop) car ends were marked \\"A\\" or \\"B\\" (later, when axles were designated by letters, the \\"B\\" car ends became \\"D\\" to match the adjacent axle), and it was not permitted to couple cars together if the ends to be coupled bore the same letter. It was found necessary to provide a turntable at Golders Green depot (near the other end of the line), for use when there was an imbalance of car directions. To avoid this problem, on many systems with a balloon loop the couplings and brake hoses are made reversible. At coal ports such as Kooragang in Newcastle, New South Wales the space inside the balloon loops is used for storing coal, so that it is not wasted. At the Olympic Park station in Sydney, the loop is flattened where the platforms are located, so that the platform faces are straight.

(The word 'Progressive' is used as an umbrella term to include Reform, Liberal, Reconstructionist and other 'non-orthodox' Jewish movements - hence the 'World Union for Progressive Judaism', so a better rendition is really Progressive Zionist Youth, but of course the acronym wouldn't work). Today there are 16,000 members active in our different sniffim (chapters) that are located in the following places: Australia, Belarus, Brazil, Germany, Israel (Noar Telem), The Netherlands, North America (NFTY), Panama, Russia, South Africa, Spain, France, United Kingdom (LJY-Netzer, RSY-Netzer) and Ukraine. The Netzer Olami head office is in Beit Shmuel, (The Head Office the World Union for Progressive Judaism) in Jerusalem. The Netzer Symbol The Netzer symbol was designed in Melbourne, Australia, by Daniel (Danny) L. Schiff. Ideology Every year, the Netzer Veida (the decision-making and ideology forum) attracts participants from most of, if not all, the sniffim. Each snif (branch) has an equal voice and vote. The official ideology of Netzer Olami is set out in the Netzer Platform, which was last changed in 2003. The following is a simplified version of the Netzer Platform 2003: # Judaism as a People, a Nation and a Religion #*Israel, with Jerusalem as its capital, is necessary as a spiritual, cultural and physical home for the Jews. #*As religious Zionists we affirm that Judaism is a people, a nation and a religion and that these three elements are indivisible. #The covenant as a moral obligation #*Israel is given to us by God as a home for the Jewish people as part of the covenant struck with Abraham. #*This means that Medinat Yisrael, the State of Israel, is obliged to make itself a more moral state than every other in the world. #*This is to be achieved by upholding the Jewish people‚Äôs highest moral obligations to be: #*#Memlechet Kohanim, 'a kingdom of priests' #*#Goy Kadosh, 'a holy people' #*#L'or Goyim, 'a light unto other nations' #Sovereignty #*The Jews have been historically persecuted and Israel provides a refuge from such pogroms. #*Therefore, we affirm Israel‚Äôs national sovereignty- allowing Jews to once again live within a Jewish majority. #*However, we must strive to ensure that such sovereignty be used to create the kind of society in which full civil, human and religious rights exist for all its citizens- a society both Jewish and Democratic. #*Reclaiming sovereignty gives us the opportunity to strive to demonstrate that the traditions and values of Judaism, in which we believe, have relevance for dealing with the issues of a modern world of nation states. #Israel and Diaspora #*Although Israel is the centre of Judaism (see 1.) Israel and Diaspora Jewry cannot exist without one another, are responsible for one another, and partners in the shaping of Jewish destiny. #*Each Jewish kehilla (community) is individual and self-regulating yet also shares responsibility for Jews everywhere. #Aliya Nimshechet #*Literally \\"continuing immigration\\" - making Aliya (moving) to Israel and then continuing to live out the Netzer values there. #Progressive Judaism in Israel #*We believe that Progressive Judaism can make a positive contribution to Am Yisrael thanks to its combination of modern and traditional ways of life. #*Therefore, we should strive to educate and inform Israelis about Progressive Judaism and support progressive communities in Israel. #A pluralistic approach to Judaism in Israel #*Israel exists to benefit the spiritual integrity of the Jewish people. #*Am Yisrael contains many interpretations of Judaism, which sometimes conflict. #*Therefore, the Jewish people will be best served when Israel is a pluralistic, democratic society. #*This would mean that no one interpretation of Judaism would have legal superiority over another. #Tikkun Olam #*We are committed to Tikkun Olam, repairing the world, and that this will help bring about the Messianic Era. #*We can bring this about on 5 different levels, all of which interlink but also can be achieved separately and in no particular order. #*#Tikkun Atzmi - healing the self #*#Tikkun Kehila - repairing our communities #*#Tikkun Am - healing the Jewish people #*#Tikkun Medinat - repairing the Jewish state #*#Tikkun Olam - repairing the world #Our Values: #*As a reform Zionist youth movement we believe in the following fundamental values. #*#Prayer through Ma‚Äôamad (creative services relevant to the time and place) #*#Celebration of the Chagim (festivals) including Shabbat #*#Jewish, especially Torah, study as an ongoing lifelong commitment. #*#Informed decision making, individually and communally #*#A belief in the oneness of God #*#The Unity of the Jewish People #*#The centrality of the land and State of Israel to Jewish life #*#Tzedaka (charity) #*#A commitment to the prophetic tradition and its understanding and vision of Judaism #*#Social Justice and a commitment to Peace #*#Equality, particularly gender equality, in Judaism #*#Mutual care and cooperation #*#Care for the environment #*#The dignity of all human beings, tolerance for their differences and a respect for ‚Äúthe other‚Äù within our society and community. #*The exact meanings of these values to the daily lives of Netzer chevarim (members) is open to their own interpretation. #Reform Zionist Community #*We recognise the value of communal living and urge chevarim to consider the option. #*We will support Reform Zionist communities built upon our values (see 9.) who are committed to becoming ones of intimacy, purpose, of participation and of communal religious authority. #Ivrit (Hebrew) #*Ivrit is the language of the Scriptures and so is vital for the study of Judaism #*Ivrit also unifies the Jewish people with a common language and strengthens ties between the Diaspora and Israel. #*We are therefore committed to learning Ivrit and teaching it to others. #Spending Time in Israel #*The completion of the ideals expressed in 1-11 can be made easier if all chevarim were to spend an extended period of time in Israel. #*We should, therefore, try to ensure that as many chevarim as possible come to Israel as part of a Netzer program, such as Israel Tour #*We also encourage chevarim to spend a serious length of time in Israel after leaving the movement. #Hagshama (Self-realisation) and Activism #*We are committed to being an activist, as well as educational, movement. #*One way to achieve this is through hagshama- that is, the living out of the Netzer ideology in our everyday lives. #*We also believe that it is both our right and responsibility to take a stand on key issues and work actively to bring about our vision of the world. #Geula (redemption) #*By implementing the ideology expressed in points 1-13 we believe that we can hasten the coming of Messianic Age and the redemption of the Jewish People. #*The path to this dream has been a difficult one and although significant progress has already been made, great challenges still lie ahead. #*\\"Lo alecha hamlacha ligmor, v'lo atah ben chorin lehibatel mimena\\" - It is not your duty to complete the work; yet neither are you free to desist from it.

PRRs are germline-encoded host sensors, which detect molecules typical for the pathogens. They are proteins expressed, mainly, by cells of the innate immune system, such as dendritic cells, macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils and epithelial cells, to identify two classes of molecules: pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which are associated with microbial pathogens, and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which are associated with components of host's cells that are released during cell damage or death. They are also called primitive pattern recognition receptors because they evolved before other parts of the immune system, particularly before adaptive immunity. PRRs also mediate the initiation of antigen-specific adaptive immune response and release of inflammatory cytokines. Molecules recognized The microbe-specific molecules that are recognized by a given PRR are called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and include bacterial carbohydrates (such as lipopolysaccharide or LPS, mannose), nucleic acids (such as bacterial or viral DNA or RNA), bacterial peptides (flagellin, microtubule elongation factors), peptidoglycans and lipoteichoic acids (from Gram-positive bacteria), N-formylmethionine, lipoproteins and fungal glucans and chitin. Endogenous stress signals are called damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and include uric acid and extracellular ATP, among many other compounds. Classification There are several subgroups of PRRs. They are classified according to their ligand specificity, function, localization and/or evolutionary relationships. Based on their localization, PRRs may be divided into membrane-bound PRRs and cytoplasmic PRRs. * Membrane-bound PRRs include Toll like receptors (TLRs) and C-type lectin receptors (CLRs). * Cytoplasmic PRRs include NOD-like receptors (NLRs) and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs). PRR types and localization =Membrane-bound PRRs= Receptor kinases PRRs were first discovered in plants. Since that time many plant PRRs have been predicted by genomic analysis (370 in rice; 47 in Arabidopsis). Unlike animal PRRs, which associated with intracellular kinases via adaptor proteins (see non-RD kinases below), plant PRRs are composed of an extracellular domain, transmembrane domain, juxtamembrane domain and intracellular kinase domain as part of a single protein. Toll-like receptors (TLR) Recognition of extracellular or endosomal pathogen-associated molecular patterns is mediated by transmembrane proteins known as toll-like receptors (TLRs). TLRs share a typical structural motif, the Leucine rich repeats (LRR), which give them their specific appearance and are also responsible for TLR functionality. Toll-like receptors were first discovered in Drosophila and trigger the synthesis and secretion of cytokines and activation of other host defense programs that are necessary for both innate or adaptive immune responses. 10 functional members of the TLR family have been described in humans so far. Studies have been conducted on TLR11 as well, and it has been shown that it recognizes flagellin and profilin-like proteins in mice. Nonetheless, TLR11 is only a pseudogene in humans without direct function or functional protein expression. Each of the TLR has been shown to interact with a specific PAMP. = The TLR signaling = TLRs tend to dimerize, TLR4 forms homodimers, and TLR6 can dimerize with either TLR1 or TLR2. Interaction of TLRs with their specific PAMP is mediated through either MyD88- dependent pathway and triggers the signaling through NF-Œ∫B and the MAP kinase pathway and therefore the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and co-stimulatory molecules or TRIF - dependent signaling pathway. MyD88 - dependent pathway is induced by various PAMPs stimulating the TLRs on macrophages and dendritic cells. MyD88 attracts the IRAK4 molecule, IRAK4 recruits IRAK1 and IRAK2 to form a signaling complex. The signaling complex reacts with TRAF6 which leads to TAK1 activation and consequently the induction of inflammatory cytokines. The TRIF-dependent pathway is induced by macrophages and DCs after TLR3 and TLR4 stimulation. Molecules released following TLR activation signal to other cells of the immune system making TLRs key elements of innate immunity and adaptive immunity. C-type lectin receptors (CLR) Many different cells of the innate immune system express a myriad of CLRs which shape innate immunity by virtue of their pattern recognition ability.Nat Rev Immunol. 2009 Jul;9(7):465-79. Signalling through C-type lectin receptors: shaping immune responses. Geijtenbeek TB, Gringhuis SI. http://www.mh- hannover.de/fileadmin/mhh/bilder/international/hbrs_mdphd/ZIB/Vorlesungen/Paper_09-10/Rev_IM_Geijtenbeek.pdf Even though, most classes of human pathogens are covered by CLRs, CLRs are a major receptor for recognition of fungi: nonetheless, other PAMPs have been identified in studies as targets of CLRs as well e.g. mannose is the recognition motif for many viruses, fungi and mycobacteria; similarly fucose presents the same for certain bacteria and helminths; and glucans are present on mycobacteria and fungi. In addition, many of acquired nonself surfaces e.g. carcinoembryonic/oncofetal type neoantigens carrying \\"internal danger source\\"/\\"self turned nonself\\" type pathogen pattern are also identified and destroyed (e.g. by complement fixation or other cytotoxic attacks) or sequestered (phagocytosed or ensheathed) by the immune system by virtue of the CLRs. The name lectin is a bit misleading because the family includes proteins with at least one C-type lectin domain (CTLD) which is a specific type of carbohydrate recognition domain. CTLD is a ligand binding motif found in more than 1000 known proteins (more than 100 in humans) and the ligands are often not sugars.Cummings RD, McEver RP. C-type Lectins. In: Varki A, Cummings RD, Esko JD, et al., editors. Essentials of Glycobiology. 2nd edition. Cold Spring Harbor (NY): Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; 2009. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1943/ If and when the ligand is sugar they need Ca2+ ‚Äì hence the name \\"C-type\\", but many of them don't even have a known sugar ligand thus despite carrying a lectin type fold structure, some of them are technically not \\"lectin\\" in function. = CLR signaling = There are several types of signaling involved in CLRs induced immune response, major connection has been identified between TLR and CLR signaling, therefore we differentiate between TLR-dependent and TLR-independent signaling. DC-SIGN leading to RAF1-MEK-ERK cascade, BDCA2 signaling via ITAM and signaling through ITIM belong among the TLR-dependent signaling. TLR-independent signaling such as Dectin 1, and Dectin 2 - mincle signaling lead to MAP kinase and NFkB activation. Membrane receptor CLRs have been divided into 17 groups based on structure and phylogenetic origin. Generally there is a large group, which recognizes and binds carbohydrates, so called carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs) and the previously mentioned CTLDs. Another potential characterization of the CLRs can be into mannose receptors and asialoglycoprotein receptors. = Group I CLRs: The mannose receptors = The mannose receptor (MR) is a PRR primarily present on the surface of macrophages and dendritic cells. It belongs into the calcium-dependent multiple CRD group. The MR belongs to the multilectin receptor protein group and, like the TLRs, provides a link between innate and adaptive immunity. It recognizes and binds to repeated mannose units on the surfaces of infectious agents and its activation triggers endocytosis and phagocytosis of the microbe via the complement system. Specifically, mannose binding triggers recruitment of MBL-associated serine proteases (MASPs). The serine proteases activate themselves in a cascade, amplifying the immune response: MBL interacts with C4, binding the C4b subunit and releasing C4a into the bloodstream; similarly, binding of C2 causes release of C2b. Together, MBL, C4b and C2a are known as the C3 convertase. C3 is cleaved into its a and b subunits, and C3b binds the convertase. These together are called the C5 convertase. Similarly again, C5b is bound and C5a is released. C5b recruits C6, C7, C8 and multiple C9s. C5, C6, C7, C8 and C9 form the membrane attack complex (MAC). =Group II CLRs: asialoglycoprotein receptor family= This is another large superfamily of CLRs that includes #The classic asialoglycoprotein receptor macrophage galactose-type lectin (MGL) #DC-SIGN (CLEC4L) #Langerin (CLEC4K) #Myeloid DAP12‚Äëassociating lectin (MDL)‚Äë1 (CLEC5A) #DC‚Äëassociated C‚Äëtype lectin 1 (Dectin1) subfamily which includes ##dectin 1/CLEC7A ##DNGR1/CLEC9A ##Myeloid C‚Äëtype lectin‚Äëlike receptor (MICL) (CLEC12A) ##CLEC2 (also called CLEC1B)- the platelet activation receptor for podoplanin on lymphatic endothelial cells and invading front of some carcinomas. ##CLEC12B #DC immunoreceptor (DCIR) subfamily which includes: ##DCIR/CLEC4A ##Dectin 2/CLEC6A ##Blood DC antigen 2 (BDCA2) ( CLEC4C) ##Mincle i.e. macrophage‚Äëinducible C‚Äëtype lectin (CLEC4E) The nomenclature (mannose versus asialoglycoprotein) is a bit misleading as these the asialoglycoprotein receptors are not necessarily galactose (one of the commonest outer residues of asialo-glycoprotein) specific receptors and even many of this family members can also bind to mannose after which the other group is named. =Cytoplasmic PRRs= NOD-like receptors (NLR) For more details, see NOD-like receptor. The NOD-like receptors (NLRs) are cytoplasmic proteins, which recognize bacterial peptidoglycans and mount proinflammatory and antimicrobial immune response. Approximately 20 of these proteins have been found in the mammalian genome and include nucleotide- binding oligomerization domain (NODs), which binds nucleoside triphosphate. Among other proteins the most important are: the MHC Class II transactivator (CIITA), IPAF, BIRC1 etc. = NLR signaling = Some of these proteins recognize endogenous or microbial molecules or stress responses and form oligomers that, in animals, activate inflammatory caspases (e.g. caspase 1) causing cleavage and activation of important inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, and/or activate the NF-Œ∫B signaling pathway to induce production of inflammatory molecules. The NLR family is known under several different names, including the CATERPILLER (or CLR) or NOD-LRR family. The most significant members of the NLRs are NOD1 and NOD2. They sense the conserved microbial peptidoglycans in the cytoplasm of the cell and therefore represent another level of immune response after membrane-bound receptors such as TLRs and CLRs. This family of proteins is greatly expanded in plants, and constitutes a core component of plant immune systems. = NODs = ::The ligands are currently known for NOD1 and NOD2. NOD1 recognizes a molecule called meso-DAP, which is a peptidoglycan constituent only of Gram negative bacteria. NOD2 proteins recognize intracellular MDP (muramyl dipeptide), which is a peptidoglycan constituent of both Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria. When inactive, NODs are in the cytosol in a monomeric state and they undergo conformational change only after ligand recognition, which leads to their activation. NODs transduce signals in the pathway of NF-Œ∫B and MAP kinases via the serine-threonine kinase called RIP2. NODs signal via N-terminal CARD domains to activate downstream gene induction events, and interact with microbial molecules by means of a C-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) region. ::The interaction and cooperation among different types of receptors typical for the innate immune system has been established. An interesting cooperation has been discovered between TLRs and NLRs, particularly between TLR4 and NOD1 in response to Escherichia coli infection. Another proof of the cooperation and integration of the entire immune system has been shown in vivo, when TLR signaling was inhibited or disabled, NOD receptors took over role of TLRs. = NLRPs = ::Like NODs, these proteins contain C-terminal LRRs, which appear to act as a regulatory domain and may be involved in the recognition of microbial pathogens. Also like NODs, these proteins contain a nucleotide binding site (NBS) for nucleoside triphosphates. Interaction with other proteins (e.g. the adaptor molecule ASC) is mediated via N-terminal pyrin (PYD) domain. There are 14 members of this protein subfamily in humans (called NLRP1 to NLRP14). NLRP3 and NLRP4 are responsible for the inflammasome activation. NLRP3 can be activated and give rise to NLRP3 inflammasome by ATP, bacterial pore-forming toxins, alum and crystals. Alongside the listed molecules, which lead to activation of NLRP3 inflammasome, the assembly and activation can also be induced by K+ efflux, Ca2+ influx, disruption of lysosomes and ROS originating from mitochondria. The NLRP3 inflammasome is essential for induction of effective immune response. The NLRP3 inflammasome can be induced by a wide range of stimuli in contrast to the NLRP4 inflammasome, which binds more limited number and variety of ligands and works in a complex with NAIP protein. = Other NLRs = ::Other NLRs such as IPAF and NAIP5/Birc1e have also been shown to activate caspase-1 in response to Salmonella and Legionella. RIG-I-like receptors (RLR) Three RLR helicases have so far been described: RIG-I and MDA5 (recognizing 5'triphosphate-RNA and dsRNA, respectively), which activate antiviral signaling, and LGP2, which appears to act as a dominant-negative inhibitor. RLRs initiate the release of inflammatory cytokines and type I interferon (IFN I). = RLR signaling = RLRs, are RNA helicases, which have been shown to participate in intracellular recognition of viral double-stranded (ds) and single stranded RNA which recruit factors via twin N-terminal CARD domains to activate antiviral gene programs, which may be exploited in therapy of viral infections. It has been suggested that the main antiviral program induced by RLR is based on ATPase activity. RLRs often interact and create cross-talk with the TLRs in the innate immune response and in regulation of adaptive immune response. Image:Simon (RIG-I and Mda5).jpgRIG-I and Mda5-mediated signalling pathway. Plant PRRs Plants contain a significant number of PRRs that share remarkable structural and functional similarity with drosophila TOLL and mammalian TLRs. The first PRR identified in plants or animals was the Xa21 protein, conferring resistance to the Gram-negative bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. Since that time two other plants PRRs, Arabidopsis FLS2 (flagellin) and EFR (elongation factor Tu receptor)have been isolated. The corresponding PAMPs for FLS2 and EFR have been identified. Upon ligand recognition, the plant PRRs transduce \\"PAMP- triggered immunity\\" (PTI). Plant immune systems also encode resistance proteins that resemble NOD-like receptors (see above), that feature NBS and LRR domains and can also carry other conserved interaction domains such as the TIR cytoplasmic domain found in Toll and Interleukin Receptors. The NBS-LRR proteins are required for effector triggered immunity (ETI). = NonRD kinases = PRRs commonly associate with or contain members of a monophyletic group of kinases called the interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) family that include Drosophila Pelle, human IRAKs, rice XA21 and Arabidopsis FLS2. In mammals, PRRs can also associate with members of the receptor-interacting protein (RIP) kinase family, distant relatives to the IRAK family. Some IRAK and RIP family kinases fall into a small functional class of kinases termed non-RD, many of which do not autophosphorylate the activation loop. A survey of the yeast, fly, worm, human, Arabidopsis, and rice kinomes (3,723 kinases) revealed that despite the small number of non-RD kinases in these genomes (9%‚Äì29%), 12 of 15 kinases known or predicted to function in PRR signaling fall into the non-RD class. In plants, all PRRs characterized to date belong to the non-RD class. These data indicate that kinases associated with PRRs can largely be predicted by the lack of a single conserved residue and reveal new potential plant PRR subfamilies. = Secreted PRRs = A number of PRRs do not remain associated with the cell that produces them. Complement receptors, collectins, ficolins, pentraxins such as serum amyloid and C-reactive protein, lipid transferases, peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRs) and the LRR, XA21D are all secreted proteins. One very important collectin is mannan- binding lectin (MBL), a major PRR of the innate immune system that binds to a wide range of bacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoa. MBL predominantly recognizes certain sugar groups on the surface of microorganisms but also binds phospholipids, nucleic acids and non-glycosylated proteins. Once bound to the ligands MBL and Ficolin oligomers recruit MASP1 and MASP2 and initiate the lectin pathway of complement activation which is somewhat similar to the classical complement pathway.  PRRs in human medicine  Research groups have recently conducted extensive research into the involvement and potential use of patient's immune system in the therapy of various diseases, the so- called immunotherapy, including monoclonal antibodies, non-specific immunotherapies, oncolytic virus therapy, T-cell therapy and cancer vaccines. NOD2 has been associated through a loss- and gain- of function with development of Crohn's disease and early-onset sarcoidosis. Mutations in NOD2 in cooperation with environmental factors lead to development of chronic inflammation in the intestine. Therefore, it has been suggested to treat the disease by inhibiting the small molecules, which are able to modulate the NOD2 signaling, particularly RIP2. Two therapeutics have been approved by FDA so far inhibiting the phosphorylation on RIP2, which is necessary for proper NOD2 functioning, gefitinib and erlotinib. Additionally, research has been conducted on GSK583, a highly specific RIP2 inhibitor, which seems highly promising in inhibiting NOD1 and NOD2 signaling and therefore, limiting inflammation caused by NOD1, NOD2 signaling pathways. Another possibility is to remove the sensor for NOD2, which has been proved efficient in murine models in the effort to suppress the symptoms of Crohn's disease. Type II kinase inhibitors, which are highly specific, have shown promising results in blocking the TNF arising from NOD-dependent pathways, which shows a high potential in treatment of inflammation associated tumors. Another possible exploitation of PRRs in human medicine is also related to tumor malignancies of the intestines. Helicobacter pylori has been shown by studies to significantly correlate with the development of a gastrointestinal tumors. In a healthy individual Helicobacter pylori infection is targeted by the combination of PRRs, namely TLRs, NLRs, RLRs and CLR DC-SIGN. In case of their malfunction, these receptors have also been connected to carcinogenesis. When the Helicobacter pylori infection is left to progress in the intestine it develops into chronic inflammation, atrophy and eventually dysplasia leading to development of cancer. Since all types of PRRs play a role in the identification and eradication of the infection, their specific agonists mount a strong immune response to cancers and other PRR-related diseases. The inhibition of TLR2 has been shown to significantly correlate with improved state of the patient and suppression of the gastric adenocarcinoma. The PRRs are also tightly connected to the proper function of neuronal networks and tissues, especially because of their involvement in the processes of inflammation, which are essential for proper function but may cause irreparable damage if not under control. The TLRs are expressed on most cells of the central nervous system (CNS) and they play a crucial role in sterile inflammation. After an injury, they lead to impairment of axonal growth and slow down or even halt the recovery altogether. Another important structure involved in and potentially exploitable in therapy after injury is the inflammasome. Through its induction of proinflammatory cytokines, IL-1Œ≤ and IL-18 it has been proposed, that inhibition of inflammasome may also serve as an efficient therapeutic method. The involvement of inflammasome has also been researched in several other diseases including experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases and in atherosclerosis connected with type II diabetes in patients. The suggested therapies include degradation of NLRP3 or inhibit the proinflammatory cytokines.

He fought for most of his career as a light-heavyweight and became the British and European champion at that weight. Later in his career he moved up to heavyweight and held the British and Commonwealth heavyweight titles. He is best remembered for fighting against Rocky Marciano for the world heavyweight championship. Cockell defeated a number of top heavyweights in his career, including Roland La Starza, Harry Matthews (twice), Tommy Farr, Freddie Beshore, Johnny Arthur, Johnny Williams and Uber Bacilieri. In his earlier incarnation as a Light Heavyweight he defeated top contenders such as Nick Barone, Albert Yvel, Lloyd Marshall and Albert Finch. Early life His full name was Donald John Cockell and he was born on 22 September 1928 in Balham, London, the son of Mary Cockell, a domestic servant from Battersea. He never knew his father. He was a blacksmith by trade, and as a result developed a strong physique. He began boxing in fairground booths and soon rose through the amateur ranks until he was ready to turn professional in 1946. Professional career Cockell had his first professional fight on 26 June 1946 against Trevor Lowder and won it by a knockout in the fifth round. He continued to build up an impressive fighting record marred by the occasional defeat. By 1950 he was ready to challenge for the vacant British light- heavyweight title recently vacated due to the retirement of Freddie Mills. On 17 October at Harringay Arena he fought Mark Hart and took the title with a knockout in the fourteenth round. Cockell fought and won two more fights before fighting the Frenchman Albert Yvel for his European light-heavyweight title. The bout took place on 27 March 1951 at Earls Court, London and Cockell won by a technical knockout in the sixth round. Cockell had two more wins before defending his British and European titles against Albert Finch, who had previously been British middleweight champion. The bout was held on 16 October 1951, at Harringay Arena, and Cockell won by a knockout in the seventh round. Cockell decisively lost his next fight against the American heavyweight Jimmy Slade. Fighting at Harringay Arena, Cockell was knocked down twice in the first round, once in the second, and twice more in the fourth. The referee then stopped the fight. Cockell followed this defeat with a points win against Italian light-heavyweight Renato Tontini, despite being knocked down twice in the second round. Cockell then fought against Randolph Turpin, who the year before, had beaten Sugar Ray Robinson to become world middleweight champion, before losing his title in the re-match. Cockell was defending his British title, and both fighters were contesting the vacant Commonwealth light- heavyweight title. The bout was at the White City Stadium on 10 June 1952. Cockell was knocked down three times during the fight and lost on a technical knockout in the eleventh round. One of the reasons for the defeat was the difficulty that Cockell had in making the weight for light-heavyweight fights. He therefore decided to fight subsequently as a heavyweight. His next three fights, at heavyweight, were all won by technical knockouts. The third one was against the Welshman, Tommy Farr, who had been an excellent heavyweight, fighting against the great Joe Louis, but who was now at the end of his career. The fight against Farr was a final eliminator for the British heavyweight title, and so put Cockell in line for a title challenge against the holder Johnny Williams. The bout for the British and Commonwealth titles was held at Harringay Arena on 12 May 1953, and Cockell won on points over fifteen rounds. Cockell then had two more wins before defending his Commonwealth title against Johnny Arthur in Johannesburg, South Africa. He won the fight on points after fifteen rounds. Cockell moved rapidly up the heavyweight rankings by scoring three wins against American fighters. First he beat Roland La Starza on points at Earls Court Arena, then he had successive victories over Harry (Kid) Matthews, first at the White City Stadium and then at Sicks' Stadium, Seattle. These victories put him in line for a title fight against the world champion Rocky Marciano. This was the first British world title bid since Tommy Farr had fought Joe Louis in 1937. =World heavyweight title fight= On 16 May 1955, Cockell fought Marciano for the world heavyweight title at Kezar Stadium in San Francisco, CA. Cockell was a 10‚Äì1 underdog and weighed 14 st 9 lbs against Marciano's 13 st 7 lbs. For the first three rounds the fight was fairly even, but as it progressed further Cockell began to take more and more punishment, without being able to hurt Marciano at all. Cockell ended the eighth round hanging through the ropes after withstanding a terrific beating. Marciano won the fight by a technical knockout 54 seconds into round nine after Cockell had been knocked down twice, for counts of eight and seven. After the fight, Marciano stated, \\"He's got a lot of guts. I don't think I ever hit anyone else any more often or harder.\\" Many boxing fans in Britain felt that Marciano employed unfair tactics, such as hitting after the bell and low punches, but although the British Boxing Board of Control protested, Cockell himself made no complaints. In covering the fight for Sports Illustrated, Budd Schulberg wrote in the 30 May 1955 edition, \\"Except for the technicality of wearing eight-ounce gloves, Don Cockell's stand against Rocky Marciano in the fading daylight hours of a cool San Francisco sunlit day was a glorious‚Äîor appalling‚Äîthrowback to this pre- Marquess of Queensberry condition. This was a bare-knuckle brawl with gloves‚Äîand not a pleasant sight either‚Äîas an uncouth, merciless, uncontrolled and truly vicious fighter (the unbeaten Champion Marciano) wore down an ox- legged, resolute fat man who came into the ring with the honor of the British Empire weighing heavily‚Äîand consciously‚Äîon his massive, blubbery shoulders. He had promised his Union Jack supporters that he would not let them down, and the first words he mumbled through swollen lips after his fearful beating in nine rounds were an apology to his fellow countrymen for not having done better.\\" =Fight record= He had 81 official fights, winning 66, of which 38 were by knockouts, and lost 14, with one drawn fight. Aftermath The title fight had taken much out of Cockell, and he lost his subsequent two fights. In September 1955 he lost to the Cuban, Nino Valdes at the White City Stadium by a technical knockout in the third round. He weighed 15 st 6 lbs for the fight. In April 1956 he was knocked out in the second round Kitione Lave, known as the \\"Tongan Terror\\". That was his final fight. In May 1956 he was stripped of his Commonwealth title and in July he surrendered his British title and retired. Cockell sued the Daily Mail after the newspaper had described him as being 'overweight and flabby' for his last fight, and not giving his all. He received ¬£7,500 damages with costs. Retirement He tried various jobs including running a farm, being a publican, and running a haulage firm based at Ninfield in East Sussex. By 1975 he was working as a craftsman blacksmith in the permanent way machine shops at the London Underground Lillie Bridge Depot in Fulham.National Union of Railwaymen, The Railway Review, 21 March 1975, p.8. His last job was as an emergency maintenance man. He died of cancer on 18 July 1983 at a hospital in Tooting.

Through his studies of apoptosis, Korsmeyer helped develop the concepts of the role of programmed cell death in carcinogenesis. In 1989 Korsmeyer was among the first to confirm that a particular form of lymphoma arose in certain B cells because they had a genetic flaw that caused them to overexpress a gene, Bcl-2, that was involved in the body's normal process for getting rid of them. He then conducted a number of studies defining the activity of a number of related genes and their role in apoptosis. Korsmeyer obtained a medical doctorate from the University of Illinois at Chicago, completed a residency at the University of California Hospitals in California, and then trained at the National Cancer Institute under Thomas A. Waldmann and Philip Leder. He then became a tenured professor, first at Washington University and then at Harvard at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, working within the Howard Hughes Medical Institute while at both universities. He was widely respected in the field and received numerous prestigious cancer research awards, including the Bristol-Myers Squibb Award for Distinguished Achievement in Cancer Research and the General Motors Cancer Research Foundation Charles S.

School (in English, Fine Arts Core Education and in French, Formation Artistique au C≈ìur de l'√âducation) is a bilingual kindergarten, elementary and high school in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is run jointly by the English Montreal School Board (EMSB) and the Commission Scolaire de Montr√©al (CSDM). F.A.C.E. was founded in 1975 with the name Fine Arts Core Elementary School (F.A.C.E.S.) and occupied the Victoria School building, now part of Concordia University, before moving to its current University Street location, to the east of McGill University's main campus in downtown Montreal. This was previously the home of the High School of Montreal, which had closed in June 1979. F.A.C.E. currently has over 1,300 students enrolled. History The Protestant School Board of Greater Montreal previously operated the school.\\"Schools\\" (). Protestant School Board of Greater Montreal. January 17, 1998. Retrieved on November 24, 2014. Schedules Students at FACE have extra arts courses in addition to the academics required by both school boards. With over three more hours of class time per week in high school, the dismissal time varies from 2:30 to 2:50 to 3:45. Even then, students are sometimes required (or elect of their own free will) to stay after school for extracurricular courses and projects. Language Each grade at FACE is typically divided into four groups: three of them French, and one of them English; however in some of the lower grades, due to varied numbers of students, there are sometimes two to three English groups or two to four French groups. The groups are identified by the number of the grade, followed by E or F, for English or French, and then by a number when there is more than one group of its language (e.g., the English side group of Grade 10 is 10E, and the French side group of Grade 10 is split into 10F1, 10F2 and 10F3). The population of the school has grown over the years requiring new groups to be added such as 1F4 and 1E2. Arts program =Music= FACE has built a reputation for its music program in Canada, partially thanks to many MusicFest Canada awards, among other things. In Grades 1 to 3, students must play xylophone and recorder, after which, in Grade 4, students are tested playing trumpet, strings, clarinet and flute for five weeks each. Each student is then placed in a band or orchestra class where he or she learns to play his or her instrument for seven and a half years until graduation (although some students change instruments partway through). The students showcase their efforts in performances held in the school auditorium at least twice a year. From Grades 1 to 11, all students participate in a choir class, where students sing a selection of classical pieces and contemporary favorites. This class combines all groups in the grade into one large classroom of approximately 120 to 150 people, with five teachers, one or more of whom plays piano . The choir class also performs at least twice a year in the school auditorium or churches. =Theatre= Starting in Grade 3, students have a Drama class where they learn theatre skills. Once in grade 10, the students are required to put on a public play, everyone in the class must participate whether they act or work in tech. The performances are held in either the school auditorium or the \\"P-sc√®ne\\", a smaller auditorium in the basement of the school (see Facilities below). The grade 11 students also have to opportunity to put on a student production, which is extra-curricular and put on entirely by the students. There can be up to two of these per year. =Visual art= Students participate in visual art classes starting in Kindergarten until grade 11. Building The FACE building is situated across University Street from the main campus of McGill University. Athletics While principally an art school, FACE has also had its fair share of athletic successes. The school's students consistently do well in school board badminton tournaments and have one Division Three basketball title to their name. The school is quickly becoming a powerhouse in both outdoor and indoor soccer having won a title in both since 2006 and in 2009, the Jazz clinched their first ever playoff berth in Division One basketball. The Jazz men's basketball team advanced to the finals, after finishing first in their division for the first time in 1999. Floors FACE is divided into five floors, from the basement to the fourth. The kindergarten classes are all on the first floor. Grades one to three generally occupy most of the second floor, while Grades 4 and higher have classes on all floors. There is also a sub-basement. There are four staircases going through the basement to the 4th floor. They are called \\"red stairs, \\"green stairs\\", \\"blue stairs\\" and yellow stairs\\". The Yellow stairs lead to the sub-basement. Another staircase, called the black stairs (by students) at the bottom of the blue stairs leads to the sub-basement. The stairs are being repainted and are no longer representative of their name. =Facilities= FACE contains basic school facilities, such as an office, a cafeteria, a library, four gymnasiums, many science and computer laboratories, and teachers' lounges. However, to suit the school's artistic program, there is also a large auditorium on the first floor which hosts numerous plays, concerts and a fashion show, as well as a smaller one in the basement dubbed the \\"P-Sc√®ne\\" by students, a word play because the room was once host to a swimming pool, which translates to \\"piscine\\" and is now principally a stage, which translates to the French \\"sc√®ne\\". North of the building, a small, abandoned yard was planted and transformed into an \\"urban forest\\" where teachers can take their classes for an outdoor teaching experience. It was baptized \\"For√™t Fr√©d√©ric-Back\\" and inaugurated in 2016.

Text was copied from this source which is ¬© European Medicines Agency. Reproduction is authorized provided the source is acknowledged. The most common side effects include nausea (feeling sick) and vomiting. Cinacalcet acts as a calcimimetic (i.e., it mimics the action of calcium on tissues) by allosteric activation of the calcium-sensing receptor that is expressed in various human organ tissues. Cinacalcet was approved in the United States in March 2004, and in the European Union in October 2004. It was the first allosteric G protein-coupled receptor modulator to enter the pharmaceutical market. In 2013, cinacalcet was the 76th top prescribed medicine in the United States. Medical uses In the United States, cinacalcet is indicated for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in people with chronic kidney disease on dialysis and hypercalcemia in people with parathyroid carcinoma. Cinacalcet can also be used to treat severe hypercalcemia in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism who are unable to undergo parathyroidectomy. In the European Union cinacalcet is indicated for: * the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) in adults with end stage renal disease (ESRD) on maintenance dialysis therapy. * the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) in children aged three years and older with end stage renal disease (ESRD) on maintenance dialysis therapy in whom secondary HPT is not adequately controlled with standard of care therapy. * part of a therapeutic regimen including phosphate binders and/or vitamin D sterols, as appropriate. * the treatment of parathyroid carcinoma and primary hyperparathyroidism in adults. * the reduction of hypercalcaemia in adults with: ** parathyroid carcinoma; ** primary HPT for whom parathyroidectomy would be indicated on the basis of serum calcium levels (as defined by relevant treatment guidelines), but in whom parathyroidectomy is not clinically appropriate or is contraindicated. =Pregnancy and lactation= Cinacalcet has pregnancy category C in the US, meaning that adequate and well- controlled studies involving cinacalcet in pregnant women have not been done. Studies have not been done in lactating women; therefore it is not known whether cinacalcet is excreted into human milk. Contraindications Hypocalcemia (decreased calcium levels) is a contraindication of cinacalcet. Those who have serum calcium levels less than 7.5 mg/dL should not be started on cinacalcet. Hypocalcemia symptoms include parathesias, myalgias, muscle cramping, tetany, and convulsions. Cinacalcet should not be administered until serum calcium levels are above 8.0 mg/dL and/or hypocalcemia symptoms are resolved. Cinacalcet is not approved for pediatric use in the United States. Adverse effects Common side effects of cinacalcet include stomach upset, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, nausea, weakness, and chest pain. Clinical trials conducted in the United States by Amgen to determine whether the drug is safe in children were halted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in February 2013, following the death of a 14-year-old participant. Overdose Serious side effects, including overdose symptoms, of cinacalcet include: * burning * tingling * unusual feelings of the lips, tongue, fingers, or feet * muscle aches or cramps * sudden tightening of muscles in hands, feet, face, or throat * seizures Interactions Cinacalcet is a strong inhibitor of the liver enzyme CYP2D6 and is partially metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP1A2. Dose adjustments may be necessary if people are treated with CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 inhibitors and medications that are metabolized by CYP2D6. Pharmacology =Mechanism of action= Cinacalcet is a drug that acts as a calcimimetic (i.e. it mimics the action of calcium on tissues) by allosteric activation of the calcium-sensing receptor that is expressed in various human organ tissues. The calcium-sensing receptors on the surface of the chief cell of the parathyroid gland is the principal negative regulator of parathyroid hormone secretion. Cinacalcet increases the sensitivity of calcium receptors on parathyroid cells to reduce parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels and thus decrease serum calcium levels.

It lies some 30 km southwest of Erfurt at the foot of the northern slope of the Thuringian Forest. The former municipalities Crawinkel, Gr√§fenhain and W√∂lfis were merged into Ohrdruf in January 2019. History =Medieval and early modern= Ohrdruf was reportedly founded in 724-726 by Saint Boniface, as the site of the first monastery in Thuringia, dedicated to Saint Michael. It was the first of several religious foundations in the town, the latest of which is the Carmelite monastery Karmel St. Elija (founded 1991). In 1550, under work began on Schloss Ehrenstein at the site of the former 8th century monastery. During the 17th century, the Schloss fell to the Grafen von Hohenlohe who after 1760 made alterations to it in Baroque style. In 1695, the orphaned Johann Sebastian Bach came to live and attend school at Ohrdruf, under the care of his older brother Johann Christoph Bach (1671‚Äì1721), who had come here in 1690 as organist at the St. Michaelis Kirche (St Michael's Church) and as a teacher at the Lyceum. Johann Sebastian lived in Ohrdruf from the ages of 10 to 15. =19th century= In the 19th century, the town became a centre of toy manufacturing. The Kewpie doll was produced here from 1913. There are still some old molds embedded in the facades of Ohrdruf buildings. In 1869, the Hohenlohe family sold the Grafschaft Gleichen including the castle and town of Ohrdruf to the Duchy of Saxe-Gotha. Ohrdruf Town Hall Schloss Ehrenstein after the recent fire Tower of the St. Michaelis Kirche =World wars= The nearby ' (military training area) served as a POW camp during World War I, housing around 20,000 prisoners. It was later used by the Wehrmacht and in the fall of 1944 a section of it became the Ohrdruf concentration camp. The prisoners were used to construct roads, railways and tunnels. The latter were to include a temporary headquarters for the Nazi leadership following the evacuation of Berlin (F√ºhrerhauptquartier). According to German historian Rainer Karlsch, the facility built at nearby Jonastal was one of two locations where Kurt Diebner's team tested its nuclear energy project. During this process, according to Karlsch, prisoners of war were killed under the supervision of the SS. Ohrdruf is believed to be the place where the historical Compi√®gne Wagon was blown up in an air attack in 1944. Ohrdruf was the first Nazi concentration camp to be liberated by the US Army, on 4 April 1945. Shortly thereafter, Generals Eisenhower, Patton and Bradley came here to look at the piles of dead bodies left behind by the SS. =Post World War II= The military training area of Truppen√ºbungsplatz Ohrdruf was taken over in July 1945 by the Red Army, since Thuringia became part of the Soviet occupation zone. The Nordlager -part of the concentration camp was razed. Two memorials to the dead were erected at around this time. In 1991, ownership was transferred to the German Defence Ministry. Since 1993, the Bundeswehr has been in charge of the area. The Soviet troops also used Schloss Ehrenstein from 1956 until 1971, leaving it in a desolate condition. Sights * Schloss Ehrenstein: A Renaissance castle with Baroque alterations, the restoration of Schloss Ehrenstein was completed in the fall of 2013 and a new exhibition on local history opened in the east wing. However, on 26 November 2013 a fire destroyed parts of the castle and many of the new exhibits. It was started inadvertently by workmen putting finishing touches to the south eastern corner of the castle. Sparks caused a smouldering fire that spread unnoticed. Despite the efforts of hundreds of fire fighters from all over the region, supported by Bundeswehr and Technisches Hilfswerk, large parts could not be saved. Small fires were still burning five days later. The town library and museum were severely damaged. * St. Michaelis Kirche: Previous churches at the site go back to the 8th century. Associated with the Bach family, who worked there as organists, the church burned down in 1753 and 1808 when fires raged through the town, but was rebuilt each time. The church was again destroyed by Allied bombing in 1945, only the roofless 15th century tower remaining. This was covered by a concrete roof until 1998/99 when the tower was reconstructed. Today, the tower houses a small chapel and an exhibition on the church's history.

Sir Isaac Pitman and Sons Ltd. 1907. by Monsignor Robert Hugh Benson that centres upon the reign of the Antichrist and the end of the world. It has been called prophetic by Dale Ahlquist, Joseph Pearce, Pope Benedict XVI and Pope Francis.Pope Francis Denounces \\"Adolescent Progressivism\\" Calls \\"Lord of the World\\" Prophetic, Catholic News Service, November 19, 2013. Background Monsignor Robert Hugh Benson, at the time of Lord of the World's 1907 publication. Monsignor Robert Hugh Benson, a former High Church Anglican Vicar, began writing Lord of the World two years after his conversion to Roman Catholicism rocked the Church of England in 1903. The youngest son of the Archbishop of Canterbury, Edward White Benson, and the society hostess Mary Sidgwick Benson, Robert was descended from a very long line of Anglican clergymen. He had also read the litany at his father's 1896 funeral at Canterbury Cathedral and was widely expected to one day take his father's place as the most senior clergyman in the Anglican Communion. After a crisis of faith described in his 1913 memoir Confessions of a Convert, however, Benson was received into the Roman Catholic Church on September 11, 1903.Joseph Pearce (2006), Literary Converts: Spiritual Inspiration in an Age of Unbelief, Ignatius Press. Pages 17‚Äì27. According to Joseph Pearce, \\"The press made much of the story that the son of the former Archbishop of Canterbury had become a Catholic, and the revelation rocked the Anglican establishment in a way reminiscent of the days of the Oxford Movement and the conversion of Newman.\\"Pearce (2006), page 27. The former Vicar found himself inundated with hate mail from Anglican clergy, men, women, and even children. Benson found himself accused of being \\"a deliberate traitor\\", \\"an infatuated fool\\", and of bringing dishonor upon his father's name and memory. Although he replied scrupulously to every letter, Benson was deeply hurt. He later wrote that he received considerable solace in the words that an Anglican Bishop had spoken to his mother, \\"Remember that he has followed his conscience after all, and what else could his father wish for him than that?\\"Pearce (2006), pages 27‚Äì28. After his ordination as a Catholic priest at Rome in 1904, Fr. Benson had been assigned as a Catholic Chaplain at Cambridge University. It was during his stay at Cambridge Rectory that Lord of the World was conceived and written. =Inception= According to his biographer Fr. Cyril Martindale, the idea of a novel about the Antichrist was first suggested to Fr. Benson by his friend and literary mentor Frederick Rolfe in December 1905. It was Rolfe who also introduced Mgr. Benson to the writings of the French Utopian Socialist Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon. According to Fr. Martindale, as Benson read Saint-Simon's writings, \\"A vision of a dechristianised civilisation, sprung from the wrecking of the old r√©gime, arose before him and he listened to Mr. Rolfe's suggestion that he should write a book on Antichrist.\\"Martindale (1916) Volume II, page 65. French Utopian Socialist Henri de Saint-Simon, c. 1820. Writing during the pontificate of Pope Pius X and prior to the First World War, Monsignor Benson accurately predicted interstate highways, weapons of mass destruction, the use of aircraft to drop bombs on both military and civilian targets, and passenger air travel in advanced Zeppelins called \\"Volors\\". Writing in 1916, Fr. Martindale compared Mgr. Benson's ideas for future technology with those of legendary French science fiction novelist Jules Verne.Martindale (1916), page 78. However, Mgr. Benson also presumed the survival of European colonialism in Africa, the continued expansion of Imperial Japan, and that predominant travel would continue to be by railway. Like many other Catholics of the era in which he wrote, Monsignor Benson believed in Masonic conspiracy theories and shared the political and economic views of G. K. Chesterton and Hilaire Belloc. Synopsis =Prologue= In early 21st century London, two priests, the white-haired Father Percy Franklin and the younger Father John Francis, are visiting the subterranean lodgings of the elderly Mr. Templeton. A Catholic and former Conservative Member of Parliament who witnessed the marginalization of his religion and the destruction of his party, Mr. Templeton describes to the two priests the last century of British and world history. Since the Labour Party took control of the British Government in 1917, the British Empire has been a single party state. The British Royal Family has been deposed, the House of Lords has been abolished, Oxford and Cambridge have been closed down, and all their professors sent into internal exile in Ireland. Marxism, atheism, and secular humanism, which Templeton describes as the tools of Freemasonry,Benson, Lord of the World, Saint Augustine's Press, 2011. Page 3. dominate culture and politics. The Anglican Communion has been disestablished since 1929 and, like all forms of Protestantism, is almost extinct. The world now has only three main religious forces: Catholicism, secular humanism, and \\"the Eastern religions\\".Benson (2011), page 7. Nationalism has been destroyed by Marxist internationalism and the world has been divided into three power-blocs. The first, which is generally marked in red on maps, is a European Confederation of Marxist one-party states and their colonies in Africa that use Esperanto for a world language. The second, marked in yellow, is \\"the Eastern Empire\\", whose Emperor, the \\"Son of Heaven\\", descends from the Japanese and Chinese Imperial Families. The third, the blue marked, \\"the American Republic\\", consists of North and South America. In a move that almost toppled Marxism in the Confederation during the 1970s and '80s, the Eastern Empire invaded, annexed, and now rules India, Australia, and New Zealand, as well as all of Russia east of the Ural Mountains. For this and other reasons, Mr. Templeton explains, the Confederation and the Eastern Empire are now on the brink of a global war.In the European and Asian power blocs and their prevention from going to war by the intervention of the Anti- Christ, Lord of the World is very similar to \\"A Short Tale of the Anti- Christ\\", written in 1900 by Vladimir Solovyov. There is no evidence, however, that Monsignor Benson was in any way influenced by or even aware of Solovyov. After Mr. Templeton completes his story, Fathers Franklin and Francis return to their spartan apartments at Westminster Cathedral. =Book I: The Advent= Prominent socialist politician Ramsay MacDonald, c. 1911. The leader and spokesman for the left-wing of the Labour Party before and after their first election to the House of Commons in 1906, MacDonald was a probable model for Julian Felsenburgh. In 1924, he became the first Labour Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Oliver Brand, an influential Labour MP from Croydon, listens as his secretary, Mr. Phillips, describes the seemingly inevitable rush toward war between Europe and the Eastern Empire. He mentions that a mysterious Senator Felsenburgh has unexpectedly taken charge of the American Republic's peace delegation. Felsenburgh is tirelessly crisscrossing the Empire, delivering speeches to rapt audiences. The Senator shows a remarkable fluency in the languages of his listeners. In conversation with his wife, Mabel, Oliver comments that war between Europe and the Empire will be \\"Armageddon with a vengeance\\", and expresses hope that Senator Felsenburgh will save the day. Although Mabel Brand appears concerned, her husband responds, \\"My dear, you must not be downhearted. It may pass as it all passed before. It is a great thing that we are listening to America at all. And this Mr. Felsenburgh seems to be on the right side.\\"Benson (2011), page 19. Westminster Cathedral, London. Over breakfast, Oliver frets about his upcoming trip to Birmingham, where the outraged population is again demanding the right to trade freely with the American Republic. As his mind returns to the possible war against the Empire, Brand ponders that the real problem is the survival of religious belief in the Eastern Empire‚ÄîBuddhism, Islam, Sufism, Confucianism, and Pantheism. In Great Britain, only Catholicism remains in \\"a few darkened churches\\" and \\"with hysterical sentimentality\\" in Westminster Cathedral. He ponders with disgust how, against his opposition, Ireland was granted Home Rule and \\"opted for Catholicism.\\" Furthermore, the city of Rome was \\"given up wholly\\" in exchange for all church property in Italy to Pope John XXIV, who has transformed it into a Hong Kong-style enclave where \\"mediaeval darkness\\" reigns supreme. He recalls with outrage how the Italian Republic moved its capital to Turin. As he departs to catch a volor to Birmingham, Oliver looks out at \\"the grey haze of London, really beautiful, this vast hive of men and women who had learned at least the primary lesson of the gospel that there was no God but man, no priest but the politician, and no prophet but the schoolmaster.\\"Benson (2011), pages 19‚Äì22 Dutch School, c. 1600). As she prepares to board a train to Brighton, Mabel Brand witnesses a Government volor crash into the station. As the Government's Ministers of Euthanasia arrive and begin to finish off the wounded, maimed and dying, Mrs. Brand witnesses Father Percy Franklin arrive. She is stunned to see the priest open his coat, pull out his crucifix and give the Last Rites to the dying Catholic lying next to her. After she returns home, deeply moved and traumatized by what she has witnessed, Mabel tells Oliver that both Father Franklin and the dying man seemed to believe in what they were doing. While deeply grieved that his wife has witnessed the horrors of the accident, Oliver explains Catholic doctrine about the Afterlife, which he mocks as a ridiculous belief that a person's mind can survive despite their brain being dead. According to Brand, for Father Franklin, the soul of the man is either \\"in a sort of smelting works being burned\\", or if \\"that piece of wood took effect\\" he is \\"somewhere beyond the clouds\\" with the Holy Trinity, the Mother of God, and the Communion of Saints. He explains that \\"that kind of thing may be nice, but it isn't true.\\" Impressed by her husband's explanation of the fallacy of religion, Mabel relaxes.Benson (2011), pages 22‚Äì25. Evan Roberts, the lay preacher at the heart of the 1904-1905 Welsh Revival, was acknowledged by Monsignor Benson as one of the models for Julian Felsenburgh. At the residence of the Cardinal-Protector near Westminster Cathedral, Father Percy Franklin finishes writing his Latin language report to Rome about the mass defections taking place among English Catholics and the recent conversions from the crumbling Anglican Communion. As he walks toward the elevator, Father Franklin finds that Father John Francis, whom he has been attempting to nurse through his mounting doubts, has lost his faith and decided to leave the priesthood. In a last-ditch effort to prevent this, Father Franklin explains that Christianity \\"may be untrue\\", but it cannot be absurd and false as long as educated and intelligent people continue to believe in its teachings. Unmoved, Father Francis rebuffs Father Franklin's argument and, with bottomless self-pity, asks whether they can remain friends. Father Franklin responds, \\"What kind of friends could we be?\\" An infuriated Fr. Francis leaves in a huff.Benson (2011), pages 28‚Äì33. After saying his prayers before the Eucharist in the Tabernacle, Father Franklin joins his fellow priests as they discuss Felsenburgh over dinner. Later, as he ponders the disintegration of Catholicism throughout the world, Father Franklin decides that what the Church needs most is a new religious order, which will help the Faith to survive and spread in the catacombs.Benson (2011), pages 37‚Äì41. Trafalgar Square, London. While giving a speech at Trafalgar Square (now with Nelson's Column replaced with statues of prominent socialists), Oliver Brand is wounded in the arm by a Catholic layman armed with a pistol. After the would-be assassin is beaten to death by the assembled crowd, Oliver informs Mabel of the news. Senator Felsenburgh is crisscrossing the East delivering multiple speeches, possibly on the behalf of the Emperor, trying to disperse the warmongering Eastern Convention (vaguely associated with the Sufis). Even so, Oliver explains that he must travel to Paris to prepare armaments for expected war. He explains that an explosives manufacturer named Benninschein has developed weapons of mass destruction and sold them to both power blocs. Therefore, a war will leave at least one power bloc completely annihilated.Benson (2011), pages 44‚Äì52. Hours later, a glowing Oliver returns from Paris and tells Mabel that, due to Felsenburgh, all chances of war have evaporated. It will soon be announced, and Oliver urges Mabel to come with him at once. Felsenburgh, he explains, will be there.Benson (2011), pages 52‚Äì56. London Victoria Station. As the Brands depart for their meeting with Felsenburgh, Oliver's secretary, Mr. Phillips arrives at the flat of Father Percy Franklin. Explaining that Oliver Brand's elderly mother used to be a Catholic, Phillips explains that she wishes to return to the Church before her imminent death. Although he knows it might be a setup, Father Franklin feels that he cannot refuse. After having what he expects to be his last Confession heard, he walks to London Victoria Station to catch a train to Croydon. To his shock, Father Franklin encounters cheering crowds and electrified letters announcing the dispersal of the Eastern Convention, the calling off of the expected war, the establishment of \\"universal brotherhood\\", and Felsenburgh's imminent arrival in London. After secretly arriving at the Brands' home, Fr. Franklin is met by Mrs. Brand and, realizing that she is completely sincere, he receives her back into the Catholic Church.Benson (2011), pages 58‚Äì68. The Brands return home an hour earlier than expected. Enraged that a priest would visit his home, Oliver is utterly infuriated that his mother would actually request such a thing. Despite his outraged demands, Father Franklin refuses to reveal who acted as the go-between. To Oliver's shock, Mabel urges Father Franklin to leave in peace. She explains that he will see Felsenburgh and the overflowing joy that his arrival has occasioned in England. This is why, Mabel explains, she is no longer afraid of him or of others like him. Deeply surprised that he will not be arrested, Father Franklin leaves into the summer night.Benson (2011), pages 69‚Äì74. As he returns to Victoria Station, Father Franklin encounters a rally being addressed by Senator Felsenburgh. For a brief moment, the Senator's hypnotic powers of persuasion cause the priest to believe in him, but Father Franklin's doubts about the Catholic Faith are soon overcome.Benson (2011), pages 74‚Äì78. =Book II: The Encounter= Devil. Detail from the Deeds of the Antichrist fresco by Luca Signorelli, c. 1501. As Oliver Brand reads Mabel an account of Felsenburgh's arrival in England in the Marxist newspaper New People, it is revealed that the Senator, who speaks all languages with equal fluency, has been hailed as the Mahdi throughout the Islamic World. It boasts that his background has nothing \\"that convicts him of sin\\", in contrast to the corrupt practices that have \\"made the sister continent what she is today\\".Benson (2011), pages 79‚Äì81. It adds, however, \\"Of his actual words we have nothing to say. So far as we are aware, no reporter made notes at the moment; but the speech, delivered in Esperanto, was a very simple one; and very short. It consisted of a brief announcement of the great fact of Universal Brotherhood, a congratulation to all who were yet as live to witness this consummation of history; and at the end, an ascription of praise to the Spirit of the World whose incarnation was now accomplished.\\"Benson (2011), pages 81‚Äì82. The article proceeds to mock the supernatural as dead. It announces that a new and enlightened age has come and that mankind is finally ready for world peace.Benson (2011), pages 82‚Äì84. Meanwhile, as her son is away with Felsenburgh, Mrs. Brand takes a sudden turn for the worse. Ignoring Mabel's sermons about how Christianity has divided the human race and caused nothing but terrible violence, Mrs. Brand pleads for Father Franklin to be summoned. When Oliver returns home that day, a weeping Mabel informs him that his mother died an hour before. Clutching her rosary, Mrs. Brand had continued to scream for a priest as long as she was able to speak. Mabel explains, however, that she had had her mother-in-law involuntarily euthanised, knowing that her husband would desire it. Although moved to tears by his mother's passing, Oliver tells Mabel that she did the right thing.Benson (2011), pages 87‚Äì93. Meanwhile, Father Franklin, who has been summoned to Rome by Pope John XXIV, arrives in Paris to board a volor connection to Italy. As he waits at the main volor station in the former Basilica of the Sacred Heart in Montmartre, Father Franklin ponders how the England that he is leaving behind is beginning to resemble an earthly Hell. Upon his arrival in Rome, Father Franklin is greeted by the Cardinal Protector of England and informed that the Pope will receive him at eleven o'clock.Benson (2011), pages 94‚Äì107. The Crucifixion by Simon Vouet, 1622. Upon being shown into the presence of His Holiness, Father Franklin explains his ideas for the Church's survival under the rule of Julian Felsenburgh. The answer must be increasing standardization and centralization. After recounting the previous steps taken towards centralization, such as the forced merging of all religious orders, the abolition of the Eastern Catholic Churches, and the forced residence of all members of the College of Cardinals in Rome, Father Franklin recommends that violence must never be used ‚Äì the Mass and the rosary must be the primary weapon against the coming persecution.Benson (2011), pages 106‚Äì110. In conclusion, Father Franklin recommends the forming of a new religious order, with no habit or badge, \\"freer than the Jesuits, poorer than the Franciscans, more mortified than the Carthusians: men and women alike ‚Äì the three vows for their Church; each Bishop responsible for their sustenance; a lieutenant in each country.... And Christ Crucified for their patron.\\"Benson (2011), page 110. After the audience, Father Franklin is assigned as an assistant to the ailing Cardinal Protector of England. His duties are to offer daily Mass in the Cardinal's Oratory and to read and summarize all reports from England. During his free hours, Father Franklin takes long walks through the city. He ponders how the Eternal City, which the Pope has divided into four national quarters, now represents a microcosm of the world.Benson (2011), pages 111‚Äì112. Towards the end of August, as Father Franklin walks toward the celebration of the Pope's Name Day ‚Äì significantly, the Pope is named John, so the feast in question is the rather unusual choice of the Decapitation, not the more popular Nativity, of St. John the Baptist -, he passes the yoked carriages of the deposed Crowned Heads of Europe. As he recognizes the British Royal Family, the German House of Hohenzollern, the House of Romanov, the Spanish and French Houses of Bourbon, and scores of \\"lesser powers\\", Father Franklin ponders the \\"appalling danger\\" their presence constitutes \\"in a democratic world.\\" The world, he knows, affects \\"to laugh at the desperate play-acting of Divine Right on the part of fallen and despised families\\", but he shudders to think what could happen if that sentiment ever turns to anger.Benson (2011), pages 113‚Äì114. Half an hour later, Father Franklin follows the Pope in a procession through the streets of Rome and ponders the contrast between the Church and the World. \\"The two Cities of Augustine lay for him to choose. The one was that of a world self-originated, self-organized and self sufficient, interpreted by such men as Marx and Herve, socialists, materialists, and, in the end, hedonists, summed up at last by Felsenburgh. The other lay displayed in the sight he saw before him, telling of a Creator and of a creation, of a Divine purpose, a redemption, and a world transcendent and eternal from which all sprang and moved. Of the two, John and Julian, was the Vicar, and the other the Ape, of God... And Percy's heart in one more spasm of conviction made its choice...\\"Benson (2011), page 115. As the Pope, the College of Cardinals, and the deposed royals assemble in the Vatican, Father Franklin's heart quickens as he watches the Papal Mass that follows, in which the former monarchs serve the Pope at the Altar.Benson (2011), pages 115‚Äì116. As Pope John Elevates the Host, Father Franklin ponders that here lies the one hope of the world's dwindling Catholics, \\"as mighty and little as once within the manger. There was none other that fought for them but only God.\\" He realizes that if God cannot be moved from His silence by the persecution of the Faithful, how could He not respond to the reenactment of His Son's Passion and Death, which pleads now within an \\"island of Faith amid a sea of laughter and hatred\\"?Benson (2011), page 116. After the Mass, as an exhausted Father Franklin finally sits down, the heartbroken Cardinal- Protector of England arrives and informs him that Julian Felsenburgh is now President of Europe. As they examine the dispatches late into the night, it soon becomes clear that the news is true. After each of the Great Powers offered him the Presidency and was repeatedly refused, a Convention of Powers offered Felsenburgh a unified proposal. Felsenburgh was to \\"assume a position hitherto undreamed of in democracy\\"‚Äîa House of Government in every Capital, a final veto lasting three years on every motion submitted to him, legal power granted to every motion he submits on three consecutive years, and the title President of Europe.Benson (2011), page 117. The narration reads, \\"...all this, Percy saw very well, involved the danger of a unified Europe increased tenfold. It involved all of the stupendous force of Socialism directed by a brilliant individual. It was a combination of the strongest characteristics of the two methods of Government. The offer had been accepted by Felsenburgh after eight hours silence.\\" The Place de la Concorde, Paris. Tossing and turning through a sleepless night, Father Franklin ponders \\"the madness that had seized upon the nations; the amazing stories that had poured in that day of the men in Paris, Who, raving like Bacchantes, had stripped themselves naked in the Place de la Concorde, and stabbed themselves to the heart, crying to thunders of applause that life was too enthralling to be endured... of the crucifixion of the Catholics that morning in the Pyrenees, and the apostasy of three bishops in Germany...\\" Heartsick, Father Franklin ponders how God can make no sign and speak no word.Benson (2011), page 120. As morning breaks, the Cardinal-Protector arrives and announces that he is terminally ill. When he dies, Pope John has decided that it will be Father Franklin who will succeed him. The following day, Father Franklin arrives for a Papal Allocution. Fully expecting Pope John to issue another Anathema against both Marxism and Freemasonry‚Äîthe ideological pillars of Felsenburgh's new order‚Äî Father Franklin silently laments that the world will simply ignore it. Instead, he is stunned as the Pope instead announces that he is creating an Order of Christ Crucified to spread the Faith in the face of persecution.Benson (2011), pages 122‚Äì128. Meanwhile, President Felsenburgh has instructed the Parliaments of Europe to institute weekly Humanist ceremonies, inspired by the rituals of Freemasonry,Benson (2011), page 137. in all the cathedrals and churches which are not in Catholic hands. Attendance is to be optional except for the four annual festivals of Maternity, Life, Sustenance, and Paternity. Those who refuse to attend are threatened with dire consequences.Benson (2011), pages 133‚Äì135, 136‚Äì140. As Oliver Brand, now Minister of Public Worship,Benson (2011), page 136. plans the upcoming festival of the Maternity with ex-priest John Francis, he learns to his dismay that the Cardinal-Protector of England has died and that Father Percy Franklin has taken his place.Benson (2011), pages 129‚Äì133. In conversation with Mabel, Oliver expresses contempt for the Pope's new religious order and calls it the most foolish thing that the Catholic Church could ever have done.Benson (2011), pages 140‚Äì141. Meanwhile, in Rome, Cardinal Franklin arrives at his offices and reads reports of the new Humanist rituals. He recalls with dismay that John Francis was only recently offering the Mass at Catholic Altars. He ponders that Felsenburgh's rituals are \\"Positivism of a kind, Catholicism without Christianity, Humanity worship without its inadequacy.\\"Benson (2011), pages 143‚Äì144. With a deep sense of pessimism, the Cardinal recalls the outrage which these decrees have caused among the world's Catholics and how, in a recent Audience, he and Cardinal Hans Steinmann of Germany urged Pope John to issue \\"a stringent decree... forbidding acts of violence on the part of Catholics.\\" The faithful are to be encouraged to be patient, to quietly avoid Humanist worship, to say nothing unless arrested and questioned, and to gladly suffer persecution for Christ's sake.Benson (2011), pages 144‚Äì145. As the Pope considers their proposal, Cardinal Franklin learns that Mr. Phillips‚ÄîOliver Brand's now disgraced Secretary‚Äîurgently wishes to see him. He gives orders that Mr. Phillips is to arrive in January.Benson (2011), pages 145‚Äì146. As Advent proceeds to Christmas, Cardinal Franklin witnesses the new Order of Christ Crucified go forward \\"with almost miraculous success.\\" Practically the entirety of Rome has enrolled, including the deposed monarchs. From throughout the world, long lists arrive of new members drawn up by their Bishops,Benson (2011), pages 147‚Äì149. \\"...but better than all this was the tidings of victory in another sphere. In Paris forty of the new-born Order had been burned alive in one day in the Latin Quarter, before the Government intervened. From Spain, Holland, and Russia had come in other names. In D√ºsseldorf, eighteen men and boys, taken by surprise at the singing of Prime in the Church of St. Lawrence, had been cast down one by one into the city sewer, each chanting as he vanished: Christi Fili Dei vivi miserere nobis, and from the darkness had come the same broken song until it was silenced with stones. Meanwhile, German prisons were thronged with the first batches of recusants. The world shrugged its shoulders, and declared that they had brought it on themselves, while it yet deprecated mob violence, and requested the attention of the authorities and the decisive repression of this new conspiracy of superstition. And within St. Peter's Church the workmen were busy at the long rows of new altars, affixing to the stone diptychs the brass-forged names of those who had already fulfilled their vows and gained their crowns. It was the first word of God's reply to the world's challenge.\\"Benson (2011), pages 149‚Äì150. When Mr. Phillips arrives in Rome on New Year's Day, his news horrifies Cardinal Franklin‚ÄîEnglish and German Catholics are plotting a suicide bombing against the Abbey where Felsenburgh's inner circle meets. Cardinal Franklin informs Pope John, who immediately dispatches him and the Cardinal Steinmann of Germany, to their respective homelands to try to prevent the bombing. As their volor flies over the Alps, the two Cardinals encounter an enormous squadron of volors heading south from England and Germany. Having also learned of the plot through Mr. Phillips, President Felsenburgh has ordered the Dresden-style destruction of Rome in retaliation.Benson (2011), pages 152‚Äì166. An anonymous painting of the 1666 Great Fire of London graces the cover of the 2015 edition of Lord of the World. Using Benninschein's new explosives, the Anglo-German volors systematically firebomb the entire city of Rome, killing Pope John, all the assembled Cardinals, and countless unarmed men, women, and children. Meanwhile, news of the plot triggers anti-Christian pogroms to spread throughout the world. In London, Mabel Brand witnesses mobs of militant Atheists crucifying Christian men, women, and children and lynching priests before her very doors. Having believed that only religious belief could incite such violence, Mabel's faith in Felsenburgh is left deeply shaken. Upon his return home, Oliver Brand attempts to console his wife. He explains that the pogrom has happened because the people of England have not yet been purged from the residue of Christianity. When Mabel asks why the riots were not obstructed by the police, however, Brand admits that the police have been ordered to stand down. Although she admits that she has been contemplating suicide, Mabel relaxes when informed that Felsenburgh will soon be arriving. Oliver reminds her, ominously, that it is over. Rome has already been destroyed and that he co-signed the orders. Devastated, Mabel dissolves in tears.Benson (2011), pages 167‚Äì176. Blessed Sacrament Chapel, Westminster Cathedral, London. Location of the lynching of the Archbishop and eleven priests during the pogrom. Catholic priest Father Dixon walks through the Southwark Cathedral in 1942, after extensive damage was caused by Luftwaffe fire-bombing The following day, Oliver Brand reads news reports of the riots. According to the Marxist newspaper New People, Westminster Cathedral has been sacked and every altar overthrown. A priest managed to consume the Eucharist moments before being seized and throttled. The Archbishop, two bishops, and eleven priests have been lynched in the sanctuary. Thirty-five convents have been destroyed and St George's Cathedral, Southwark, has been burned to the ground. It is alleged that for the first time since the introduction of Christianity to England that there is not a single functioning church.Benson (2011), pages 177‚Äì178. That afternoon, the Brands and all the people of London enter St. Paul's Cathedral for the Feast of Maternity, over which Felsenburgh will preside. After procession with incense and a few opening remarks by turncoat Mr. John Francis, Felsenburgh enters the Cathedral dressed in the red and black robes of a British High Court judge. As the crowd listens with rapt admiration, Felsenburgh speaks of the destruction of Rome and the recent pogroms against Christians. He explains that future generations of men must flush with shame to remember that mankind had once turned its back on the risen light. The worship of the statue inside St. Paul's Cathedral is inspired by the veneration of the Goddess of Reason inside Notre Dame Cathedral following the French Revolution. Then, a curtain is torn aside, revealing a statue of a naked mother and child. Felsenburgh leads all the assembled worshipers in prayer to the \\"Mother of us all.\\" All those present hail the statue as Queen and Mother. The chapter ends with the words, \\"Then in the heavenly light, to the crash of drums, above the screaming of the women and the battering of feet, in one thunder peal of worship ten thousand voices hailed Him Lord and God.\\"Benson (2011), page 189. =Book III: The Victory= Nazareth, c. 1900. After the destruction of Rome, Cardinals Franklin and Steinmann traveled to the deathbed of the only other survivor of the College of Cardinals ‚Äî the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem. They held an impromptu Papal Conclave, which resulted in the election of Cardinal Franklin as Pope Sylvester III.When Lord of the World was published in 1907, the Antipopes Alexander V and John XXIII were seen as validly elected Roman Pontiffs. Therefore, Monsignor Benson's Pope John is \\"XXIV\\" rather than \\"XXIII\\". As Pope Silvester III was then seen as an Antipope, Monsignor Benson's Pope Silvester is \\"III\\" rather than \\"IV\\". Soon after, the Latin Patriarch died and Cardinal Steinmann returned to Berlin, where he was promptly lynched. Pope Sylvester has since reorganized the Church so that it will survive the global persecution under Felsenburgh's Government. He has secretly rebuilt the College of Cardinals, but his actual name and location (Nazareth) are known only to the members of the College. Meanwhile, Felsenburgh has ordered the Test Act ‚Äî all the world's people must either formally disavow the existence of God or be executed without trial. While large numbers of religious believers refuse and are slaughtered, many others agree without any qualms. Mr Philipps, who states that he cannot disavow the existence of God and cannot either confess to Him, is granted a week to make up his mind. With the last remnant of her faith shattered, Mabel Brand secretly leaves her husband and checks into a voluntary euthanasia clinic. All of Oliver's attempts to find her are in vain. After the eight-day waiting period required by law, Mabel writes a suicide letter to her husband and voluntarily suffocates herself using a provided gas mask. As her life fades away, Mabel finds, \\"something resembling sound or light, something she knew in an instant to be unique, tear across her vision. Then she saw, and understood...\\"Benson (2011), page 236. Due to an informer‚ÄîCardinal Dolgorovski of Moscow‚Äîthe President has learned of the new Pope and his plans for a secret meeting of remaining Cardinals in Nazareth. The President demands the British Cabinet to join in a volor-bombing attack to wipe out the Church, while allowing the inhabitants of the village to escape. He further suggests that Cardinal Dolgorovski should be executed to prevent him from \\"relapse\\" and taking over the remnants of the Roman Catholic Church. Oliver Brand and the Cabinet give the President their unanimous assent. In Nazareth, Pope Sylvester is told that Cardinal Dolgorovski has refused a direct order to attend. He realizes that Dolgorovski has been turned and that Nazareth is about to be destroyed. He gives orders to warn the city's residents to flee and then offers Mass followed by Eucharistic Adoration. Eucharist displayed in a monstrance, flanked by candles being adored by a kneeling altar server. As Felsenburgh personally flies in the volor- squadron, the narration states, \\"He was coming now, swifter than ever, the heir of temporal ages and exile of eternity, the final piteous Prince of rebels, the creature against God, blinder than the sun which paled and the earth which shook; and, as He came, passing even then through the last material stage to the thinness of a spirit fabric, the floating circle swirled behind Him, tossing like phantom birds in the wake of a phantom ship.... He was coming, and the earth, rent once again in its allegiance, shrank and reeled in the agony of divided homage....\\"Benson (2011), page 259. Greek icon of the Second Coming, c.1700 As volor firebombs begin to rain down on Nazareth, Pope Sylvester and the Cardinals calmly continue to chant the Pange Lingua before a Host exposed in a Monstrance on the altar. The last words of the novel are: \\"Then this world passed, and the glory of it.\\"Benson (2011), page 260. (Sic transit gloria mundi). Influences Monsignor Benson drew upon history, other works of science fiction, and current events to create a fictional universe. =Literature= Frederick Rolfe's anti-Modernist satirical novel Hadrian VII inspired numerous aspects of Lord of the World, including the introductory first chapter.Martindale (1916) Volume 2. pp. 68‚Äì69. According to his biographer, Fr. Cyril Martindale, Mgr. Benson's depiction of the future was in many ways an inversion of the science fiction novels of H. G. Wells.Martindale (1916), pages 69, 78. Like many other Christians of the era, Benson was sickened by Wells' belief that Atheism, Marxism, World Government, and Eugenics would lead to an earthly utopia. Due to his depiction of a Wellsian future as a murderous global police state, Benson's novel has been called one of the first modern works of dystopian science fiction. =History= A further source of inspiration was Mgr. Benson's interest in history. Fr. Percy Franklin's constant fear of arrest while carrying out his priestly ministry in London is inspired by Mgr. Benson's research into the aftermath of the English Reformation. Fr. Franklin's suspicion that Fr. Francis may have become a police informant and his belief that Mrs. Brand's request for a priest is a trap to ensnare him are reminiscent of the tactics used by Elizabethan Era priest hunters like Sir Richard Topcliffe. Julian Felsenburgh's leadership style was modeled after that of Napoleon Bonaparte, whose mistakes he was intended to correct. In one of the three notebooks he kept while writing Lord of the World, Mgr. Benson wrote that while Napoleon's weakness was \\"his soft heart: he forgave,\\" Felsenburgh, \\"never forgives: for political crime he strips of position, making the man incapable of holding office; for treachery to himself he drops them out of his councils.\\" He further described the Anti-Christ as \\"complete hardness, and kindness\\". The number of former priests and bishops who reject Catholicism are inspired by the priests who took an oath rejecting the authority of the Holy See following the French Revolution. All were excommunicated by the Pope and became employees of the French Government following the Civil Constitution of the Clergy. The word, \\"Recusants\\", which Fr. Franklin uses to describe Catholics who absent themselves from compulsory Humanist worship, dates from the reign of Queen Elizabeth I of England. The word was originally used to describe both Catholics and Puritans who, despite heavy fines and imprisonment, refused to attend weekly Anglican services. The conspiracy to suicide bomb President Felsenburgh and its grisly aftermath are inspired by the Gunpowder Plot of 1605, in which a small group of English Catholic noblemen led by Robert Catesby planned to blow up King James I of England during an address before Parliament. Like its fictional counterpart, the Gunpowder Plot was exploited for propaganda and used to justify a campaign to completely and permanently destroy Roman Catholicism. The scene in which President Julian Felsenburgh leads an enormous congregation in the worship of a mother goddess inside St. Paul's Cathedral is inspired by the worship of the Goddess of Reason inside Notre Dame Cathedral during the Reign of Terror. As acknowledged in the text, the character of Cardinal Dolgorovski of Moscow is inspired by Judas Iscariot.Martindale (1916), page 74.Benson (2011), pages 240‚Äì244. The word Test Act for Felsenburgh's legislative means to root out Catholicism is no invention of his or of his author, but there actually have been Test Acts in England. =Current events= Further inspiration was gleaned from Mgr. Benson's following of current events. The fear among Europeans of the Eastern Empire and its ruler, the Son of Heaven, is inspired by the shock that greeted the territorial expansion of the Japanese Empire before, during, and after the Russo-Japanese War. The dystopian Marxist Government of Britain is inspired by the events of the British general election of 1906. Prior to the election, a large number of small Marxist political parties consolidated to form a unified bloc called the Labour Party, which won 29 seats in the House of Commons. The first chapter, which describes the overthrow of the British royal family, the abolition of the House of Lords, the disestablishment of the Church of England, and the closing of the universities is inspired by the Labour Party's platform at the time the novel was written. The Marxist uprising that topples the Son of Heaven is inspired by the Russian Revolution of 1905, which Mgr. Benson was following in the newspapers. Julian Felsenburgh's sermon at St. Paul's and the emotional reaction of his listeners are inspired by press reports of the Reverend Evan Roberts and the 1904-1905 Welsh Revival. Rev. Roberts was similarly able to provoke public displays of emotion in his listeners and is regarded as the inventor of Pentecostalism. He was also the focus of a cult of personality which scandalized more traditional churches. At the height of his ministry, Rev. Roberts' denunciations of literary and cultural societies, competitive sports, and alcohol consumption temporarily caused a sea change in Welsh culture. Countless rugby teams and literary societies were voluntarily disbanded. In Welsh coal mining towns, pubs closed down for lack of business and the National Eisteddfod of Wales was almost deserted. Rev. Roberts, however, eventually came to believe that his ministry was not of God, voluntarily left the public eye, and spent the remaining years of his life resisting efforts to draw him back to the revival circuit. He died, a virtual recluse, in 1951. The Anti-Catholic riots that follow the discovery of the planned suicide bombing are inspired by Anti-Jewish Pogroms in the Russian Empire, which also took place with the collusion of senior Government officials and policemen. Composition Benson first mentioned his ideas in a letter to his mother on 16 December 1905, \\"Yes, Russia is ghastly. Which reminds me that I have an idea for a book so vast and tremendous that I daren't think about it. Have you ever heard of Saint-Simon? Well, mix up Saint-Simon, Russia breaking loose, Napoleon, Evan Roberts, the Pope and Antichrist; and see if any idea suggests itself. But I'm afraid it is too big. I should like to form a syndicate on it, but that is an idea, I have no doubt at all.\\"C. C. Martindale, S.J. (1916), The Life Of Monsignor Robert Hugh Benson, Volume 2, Longmans, Green and Co, London. pp. 65‚Äì66. In a letter to Mr. Rolfe on 19 January 1906, Benson wrote, \\"Anti-Christ is beginning to obsess me. If it is ever written, it will be a BOOK. How much do you know about the Freemasons? Socialism? I am going to avoid scientific developments, and confine myself to social. This election seems to hold vast possibilities in the direction of Anti-Christ's Incarnation ‚Äì I think he will be born of a virgin. Oh! If I dare to write all that I think! In any case, it will take years.\\"Martindale (1916), Volume 2, page 66. According to Father Martindale, the gradual evolution of Lord of the World can be charted through three of Monsignor Benson's notebooks. The first two reveal that Benson based the physical appearances of Fr. Percy Franklin and President Julian Felsenburgh on \\"a rather prominent socialist politician\\" whose name Father Martindale does not disclose.Martindale (1916), page 68. Mgr. Benson's notebooks also reveal that Pope Sylvester was originally \\"made to take refuge and confront Antichrist in Ireland.\\"Martindale (1916), page 77. On 16 May 1906, Benson wrote in his diary, \\"Anti-Christ is going forward; and Rome is about to be destroyed. Oh, it is hard to keep it up! It seems to me that I am getting terser and terser until finally the entire story will end in a gap, like a stream disappearing in sand. It is such a fearful lot that one might say, that every word seems irrelevant.\\"Martindale (1916), Volume 2, page 73. On 28 June 1906, Benson again wrote in his diary, \\"I HAVE FINISHED ANTI-CHRIST. And really there is no more to be said. Of course I am nervous about the last chapter ‚Äì it is what one may call just a trifle ambitious to describe the End of the World. (No!) But it has been done.\\"Martindale (1916), Volume 2, page 75. In a 28 January 1907 letter, Lord of the World was praised by Frederick Rolfe. Commenting on Benson's decision to satirize him as \\"Chris Dell\\" in The Sentimentalists, Rolfe wrote, \\"You are worrying yourself most unnecessarily about me, I assure you... I am laughing at the absurdity of the whole thing though I must confess that I was rather amazed when I heard that everybody recognized me in Chris. It was rather a blow to my amour propre... You will, I hope, reap a rich harvest of shekels from the transaction, and the world will forget The Sentimentalists when it stands wondering before The Lord of the World.\\"Martindale (1916), Volume 2, page 57. =Textual error in modern editions= Most modern editions of Lord of the World contain an error in Book III, Chapter Five, Section III, carried forward from a printer's error in the American edition of the book. A sentence in the second paragraph of Section III began as follows, in the British first edition: ‚ÄúIn short, it seemed that he could do no good by remaining in England, and the temptation to be present at the final act of justice in the East by which those who had indirectly been the cause of his tragedy were to be wiped out‚Ä¶‚Äù In the corrupted text found in most modern editions, the passage reads (erroneous portion in italics): \\"In short, it seemed that he could do no good by remaining in England, and the temptation to be present at the final act of justice in the East by which land, and, in fact, it was more than likely that if she were to be wiped out‚Ä¶‚Äù Release and reception Upon its 1907 publication, Lord of the World caused an enormous stir among Catholics, non-Catholics, and even among non- Christians. Mgr. Benson was therefore kept busy answering letters from both readers and literary critics. Mgr. Benson's reading of these letters helped inspire his novel The Dawn of All. In reply to a critic who expressed a belief that Mabel Brand condemned herself to Hell by committing suicide, Mgr. Benson wrote, \\"I think Mabel was alright, really. Honestly, she had no idea that suicide was a sin; and she did pray as well as she knew how at the end.\\"Martindale (1916), pages 74‚Äì75. In a 16 December 1907 letter to Mgr. Benson's brother, British physicist Sir Oliver Lodge wrote, \\"The assumption that there can be no religion except a grotesque return to Paganism, short of admitting the supremacy of Mediaeval Rome, is an unexpected contention to find in a modern book... I am wondering what the leaders of the Church think of it. Perhaps Pius X may approve; but it is difficult to suppose that it can meet with general approbation. If it does, it is very instructive.\\"Martindale (1916), page 79. Some critics and readers misinterpreted the novel's last sentence as meaning, \\"the destruction, not of the world, but of the Church.\\" Some Marxists were reportedly \\"delighted\\" by the ending and one non-Catholic reader wrote that Lord of the World had, \\"struck heaven out of my sky, and I don't know how to get it back again.\\"Martindale (1916), pages 75‚Äì76. Other readers were more admiring. Although \\"grave exception\\" was taken there to Mgr. Benson's \\"sympathetic treatment\\" of Mabel Brand's suicide, Lord of the World was enthusiastically received in France.Martindale (1916), pages 78‚Äì79. In a letter to Mgr. Benson, Jesuit priest Fr. Joseph Rickaby wrote, \\"I have long thought that Antichrist would be no monster, but a most charming, decorous, attractive person, exactly your Felsenburgh. This is what the enemy has wanted, something to counteract the sweetness of Christmas, Good Friday, and Corpus Christi, which is the strength of Christianity. The abstruseness of Modernism, the emptiness of Absolutism, the farce of Humanitarianism, the bleakness (so felt by Huxley and Oliver Lodge) of sheer physical science, that is what your Antichrist makes up for. He is, as you have made him, the perfection of the Natural, away from and in antithesis to God and His Christ.... As Newman says, a man may be near death and yet not die, but still the alarms of his friends are each time justified and are finally fulfilled; so of the approach of Antichrist.\\"Martindale (1916), page 76. Shortly after Mgr. Benson's novel was published, British historian and future Catholic convert Christopher Dawson paid a visit to Imperial Germany. While there, Dawson witnessed the increasing de-Christianisation of German culture and the rapid growth of the Marxist Social Democratic Party. In response, Dawson called the Kaiser's Germany \\"a most soul-destroying place\\", and complained that German intellectuals, \\"examine Christianity as if it were a kind of beetle.\\" Dawson further lamented that his stay in that \\"most dreadful\\" country reminded him of \\"the state of society in Lord of the World.\\"Joseph Pearce (2006), Literary Converts: Spiritual Inspiration in an Age of Unbelief, Ignatius Press, San Francisco. Page 40-41. Furthermore, despite Mgr. Benson's subtle contempt for \\"Greek Christianity\\",Benson (2011), page 195. Mother Catherine Abrikosova, a Byzantine Catholic Dominican nun, former Marxist, and future martyr in Joseph Stalin's concentration camps, translated Lord of the World from English to Russian shortly before the Bolshevik Revolution.Kathleen West, The Regular Tertiaries of St. Dominic in Red Moscow, Blackfriars, June 1925. pp. 322‚Äì327. Legacy =Catholic intellectuals= Joseph Pearce, 2007. Although it is not as well known as the dystopian writings of Evgeny Zamyatin, George Orwell, and Aldous Huxley, Lord of the World continues to have many admirers‚Äîespecially among Conservative and Traditionalist Catholics. Reviewer Mary Whitebrough noted: Mary C. Whitebrough, \\"The Debates and Interactions of Catholics and Secularists in Early Twentieth Century England\\" in Dr. Bernard Weiman (ed.) \\"A Retrospective Look on the Intellectual Developments of the Twentieth Century\\" \\"It is commonly believed than Benson wrote Lord of the World at least partly in response to the writings of H.G.Wells with their vision of a technologically-advanced secularized future in store for humanity. But it is also possible that Wells, a veteran of numerous debates with Catholics, may have returned the favor. Wells' own The Shape of Things to Come takes up the basic plot element of Lord of the World and turns it upside down. In Things to Come, too, a secularized World Government embarks on a head-on confrontation with the Catholic Church and eventually destroys it - but for Wells, the World Secularists are the Good Guys and destroying the Church is a necessary, positive act. (...) To be sure, Wells' World Government is far less brutal than the one predicted by Benson. In Wells' version The Pope and Cardinals are simply dosed with sleeping gas, rather than being firebombed, and Catholics are mainly educated out of their reactionary ways rather than persecuted into martyrdom.(...) It is amusing to note that the Catholic Benson and the Secularist Wells were at one in dismissing the Protestants' power of resistance and seeing only the Catholic Church as a worthy opponent for Secularism. (...) The Three super states into which the world of \\"Lord of the World\\" is divided - American Republic, European Confederation and Eastern Empire - prefigure George Orwell's Oceania, Eurasia and Eastasia in the world of Nineteen Eighty Four. Orwell, omnivorous relentless reader that he was, had likely read \\"Lord of the World\\". In a 2005 essay, Joseph Pearce wrote that, while Orwell and Huxley's novels are \\"great literature\\", they \\"are clearly inferior works of prophecy.\\" Pearce explains that while \\"the political dictatorships\\" that inspired Huxley and Orwell \\"have had their day\\", \\"Benson's novel-nightmare... is coming true before our very eyes.\\"Pearce (2005), Literary Giants, Literary Catholics, page 141. Pearce elaborates, > The world depicted in Lord of the World is one where creeping secularism and > godless humanism have triumphed over traditional morality. It is a world > where philosophical relativism has triumphed over objectivity; a world > where, in the name of tolerance, religious doctrine is not tolerated. It is > a world where euthanasia is practiced widely and religion hardly practiced > at all. The lord of this nightmare world is a benign-looking politician > intent on power in the name of \\"peace\\", and intent on the destruction of > religion in the name of \\"truth\\". In such a world, only a small and shrinking > Church stands resolutely against the demonic \\"Lord of the World\\".Pearce > (2005), page 141. EWTN talk show host and American Chesterton Society President Dale Ahlquist has also praised Monsignor Benson's novel and said that it deserves a wider audience. Michael D. O'Brien's has cited it as an influence on his Apocalyptic series Children of the Last Days. =Papal statements= Pope Francis On February 8, 1992, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger criticized U. S. President George H. W. Bush's recent speech calling for \\"a New World Order\\" in a speech of his own at the Universit√† Cattolica del Sacro Cuore. In his discourse, the future Pope explained that Monsignor Benson's novel described \\"a similar unified civilization and its power to destroy the spirit. The anti-Christ is represented as the great carrier of peace in a similar new world order.\\" Cardinal Ratzinger proceeded to quote from Pope Benedict XV's 1920 encyclical Bonum sane: \\"The coming of a world state is longed for, by all the worst and most distorted elements. This state, based on the principles of absolute equality of men and a community of possessions, would banish all national loyalties. In it no acknowledgement would be made of the authority of a father over his children, or of God over human society. If these ideas are put into practice, there will inevitably follow a reign of unheard-of terror.\\" In a sermon in November, 2013, Pope Francis praised Lord of the World as depicting \\"the spirit of the world which leads to apostasy almost as if it were a prophecy.\\" In early 2015, Pope Francis further revealed Benson's influence upon his thinking, speaking to a plane load of reporters. At first apologizing for making \\"a commercial\\", Pope Francis further praised Lord of the World, despite its being \\"a bit heavy at the beginning\\". Pope Francis elaborated, \\"It is a book that, at that time, the writer had seen this drama of ideological colonization and wrote that book... I advise you to read it. Reading it, you'll understand well what I mean by ideological colonization.\\" External Link * \\"Hopes and Fears: Robert Hugh Benson‚Äôs Lord of the World\\" by Colin O‚ÄôBrien, in the Dappled Things Quarterly References Further reading * Ahlquist, Dale (2012). \\"The End of the World,\\" The American Chesterton Society, March 12.

Another type, Scan based trunked systems, (not shown) do not have a control channel. Frequencies are for discussion purposes and do not correspond to any specific system. A trunked radio system is a digital two-way radio system that uses a digital control channel to automatically assign frequency channels to groups of users. In a traditional half-duplex land mobile radio system a group of users (a \\"talkgroup\\") with portable two-way radios communicate over a single shared radio channel, with one user at a time talking. These systems typically have access to multiple channels, up to 40 - 60, so multiple groups in the same area can communicate. In a conventional (nontrunked) system, channel selection is done manually; before use the group must decide on which channel to use, and manually switch all the radios to that channel. This is an inefficient use of scarce radio channel resources, because the user group must have exclusive use of their channel regardless of how little transmission they are doing. There is also nothing to prevent multiple groups in the same area from choosing the same channel, causing conflicts. A trunked radio system is an advanced alternative in which the channel selection process is done automatically. Trunking is a more automated and complex radio system, but provides the benefits of less user intervention to operate the radio and greater spectral efficiency with large numbers of users. Instead of assigning a radio channel to one particular user group at a time, users are instead assigned to a logical grouping, a \\"talkgroup\\". When any user in that group wishes to converse with another user in the talkgroup, a vacant radio channel is found automatically by the system and the conversation takes place on that channel. Many unrelated conversations can occur on a channel, making use of the otherwise idle time between conversations. Each radio transceiver contains a microprocessor which handles the channel selection process. A control channel coordinates all the activity of the radios in the system. The control channel computer sends packets of data to enable one talkgroup to talk together, regardless of frequency. The primary purpose of this type of system is efficiency; many people can carry many conversations over only a few distinct frequencies.Talk groups, scanning, and group calls are defined in, \\"Section 2: Needs Summary,\\" Arizona Phase II Final Report: Statewide Radio Interoperability Needs Assessment, Macro Corporation and The State of Arizona, 2004, pp. 16. Trunking is used by many government entities to provide two-way communication for fire departments, police and other municipal services, who all share spectrum allocated to a city, county, or other entity. Principles of operation =Control channels= In essence, a trunked radio system is a packet switching computer network. Users' radios send data packets to a computer, operating on a dedicated frequency ‚Äî called a control channel ‚Äî to request communication on a specific talk-group. The controller sends a digital signal to all radios monitoring that talkgroup, instructing the radios to automatically switch to the frequency indicated by the system to monitor the transmission. After the user is done speaking, the users' radios return to monitoring the control channel for additional transmissions. This arrangement allows multiple groups of users to share a small set of actual radio frequencies without hearing each other's conversations. Trunked systems primarily conserve limited radio frequencies and also provide other advanced features to users. =Talkgroups= A talkgroup is an assigned group on a trunked radio system. Unlike a conventional radio which assigns users a certain frequency, a trunk system takes a number of frequencies allocated to the system. Then the control channel coordinates the system so talkgroups can share these frequencies seamlessly. The purpose is to dramatically increase bandwidth. Many radios today treat talkgroups as if they were frequencies, since they behave like such. For example, on a radio scanner it is very common to be able to assign talkgroups into banks or lock them out, exactly like that of conventional frequencies. =Fleet maps and IDs= In some agencies, groups are assigned in a fleet map. This was implemented to make it easier to assign group ID numbers. For example, EMS would be on a separate 'fleet' than police. In those fleets are subfleets or the actual talkgroups. This system is not as common as the typical trunking method, but they do exist. In some communities the ID corresponds to a location or agency. For example, it is common to see a '1' or '2' in front of a police group and another number in front of a fire group. =Scanning= Most scanners that can listen to trunked radio systems (called trunk tracking) are able to scan and store individual talkgroups just as if they were frequencies. The difference in this case is that the groups are assigned to a certain bank in which the trunked system is programmed. In other words, the talkgroups are stored on the trunked bank. =Comparison with telephone trunking= The concept of trunking (resource sharing) is actually quite old, and is taken from telephone company technology and practice. Consider two telco central office exchanges, one in town \\"A\\" and the other in adjacent town \\"B\\". Each of these central offices has the theoretical capacity to handle ten thousand individual telephone numbers. (Central office \\"A\\", with prefix \\"123\\", has available 10,000 numbers from 123-0000 to 123-9999; central office \\"B\\", with prefix \\"124\\", the same.) If all 10,000 subscribers in \\"A\\" were to simultaneously call 10,000 subscribers in \\"B\\", then it would be necessary to have 10,000 lines (in telco parlance \\"trunk lines\\", or simply \\"trunks\\") to connect the two towns. However, the odds of that happening are remote, as the number of simultaneous phone calls is usually much lower. Erlang-B is a common formula that predicts the optimal number of trunk lines actually needed under normal conditions. This concept has been simply applied to radio user groups, to determine the optimal number of channels needed, under normal conditions, to accommodate a given number of users. In the event of a widespread emergency such as a major earthquake, many more users than normal will attempt to access both the telephone and radio systems. In both cases once the trunking capacity of the systems is fully used, all subsequent users will receive a busy signal. In our example of police dispatch, different talk-groups are assigned different system priority levels, sometimes with \\"preempt\\" capability, attempting to ensure that communication between critical units is maintained. Differences from conventional two-way radio \\"Trunked\\" radio systems differ from \\"conventional\\" radio systems in that a conventional radio system uses a dedicated channel (frequency) for each individual group of users, while \\"trunking\\" radio systems use a pool of channels which are available for a great many different groups of users.The document \\"Conventional and Trunked Radio Systems Comparison Report\\" from the Department of Homeland Security analyzes and compares conventional, trunked, and hybrid LMR systems and provides high-level definitions of the architecture alternatives associated with each option. For example, if police communications are configured in such a way that twelve conventional channels are required to permit citywide dispatch based upon geographical patrol areas, during periods of slow dispatch activity, much of that channel capacity is idle. In a trunked system, the police units in a given geographical area are not assigned a dedicated channel, but instead are members of a talk-group entitled to draw upon the common resources of a smaller pool of channels. =Advantages of trunking= Trunked radio takes advantage of the probability that with any given number of user units, not everyone will need channel access at the same time, therefore fewer discrete radio channels are required. From another perspective, with a given number of radio channels, a much greater number of user groups can be accommodated. In the example of the police department, this additional capacity could then be used to assign individual talk groups to specialized investigative, traffic control, or special-events groups which might otherwise not have the benefit of individual private communications. To the user, a trunking radio looks just like an \\"ordinary\\" radio: there is a \\"channel switch\\" for the user to select the \\"channel\\" that they want to use. In reality though, the \\"Channel switch\\" is not switching frequencies as in a conventional radio but when changed, it refers to an internal software program which causes a talkgroup affiliation to be transmitted on the control channel. This identifies the specific radio to the system controller as a member of a specific talkgroup, and that radio will then be included in any conversations involving that talkgroup. This also allows great flexibility in radio usage - the same radio model can be used for many different types of system users (i.e. Police, Public Works, Animal Control, etc.) simply by changing the software programming in the radio itself. Since the talkgroups are constantly transmitting on different frequencies, trunked radio systems makes it more difficult for a scanner listener without a programmed trunk tracking scanner to keep up with the conversation. In 1997, radio scanners compatible with trunked systems appeared on the market. One of the first companies to bring these devices to market, Uniden, trademarked the term trunk tracking on December 5, 1997.US Patent and Trademark Office Registration Number 2407576, Serial Number 75400608, registered to Uniden America Corporation. Types of trunked radio systems This is not designed to be a list of manufacturers equipment types, it is intended as a list of air protocol types unless significant vendor specific modifications have been made which violate the published standard. Trunked radio technologies today have generally diverged into three distinct types or \\"tiers\\". These are not \\"official\\", but are clearly defined within protocol types:- =Entry-level= These systems are relatively primitive in their operation and only meet the minimum requirements to be defined as a \\"trunked\\" radio system. They generally do not have enhanced features such as data communications or registration awareness. They will provide simple trunking facilities for voice calls only. #SmarTrunk #Ericsson GE #*EDACS Provoice #*EDACS #*GE Mark V #Logic Trunked Radio #*LTR Standard #*LTR Passport #*LTR Standard and Passport #*LTR MultiNet #*LTR-Net #Motorola #*Type I #*Type II #*Type IIi Hybrid #*Type II SmartZone #*Type II SmartZone OmniLink =Standard= These systems exhibit some of the characteristics of a high tier trunked radio system but not all features. Therefore, they are suitable for small deployments where users are expected to use the entire network available (such as a private system covering a campus or town). Because of their lack of advanced features they generally are not suited to mission critical deployments, PAMR type operation or uncoordinated shared user types. DMR/dPMR true Tier 3/Mode 3 protocols are intended eventually to migrate into the \\"Advanced Mature high end\\" list below but today (2015) cannot be classified as such due to major interoperability issues, lack of mature protocol and lack of clearly defined user interface protocol. #OpenSky System #APCO Project 16 #dPMR Mode 3 - Has equipment manufacturer interoperability issues. #DMR Tier III - Has equipment manufacturer interoperability issues. #NXDN #*Kenwood NEXEDGE Digital trunked radio #*Icom IDAS Digital trunked Land Mobile Radio #Hytera #*Hytera DMR Tier 3 Trunking Lite #Motorola #*iDEN (integrated Digital Enhanced Network) #*Motorola Capacity Plus #*Motorola Connect Plus #*Motorola Harmony (see iDEN) =Advanced mature high end systems= Some trunked radio protocols are of special merit since they clearly stand out from the others for the following reasons:- *Proven technology used on numerous mission-critical applications around the world *Mature, thereby only undergoing minor revisions rather than major feature changes and this must have been case for at least several years *Designed for mission-critical applications *Suitable for networks in excess of 150 sites *Suitable for large numbers of users (in excess of 500 differing user group types) *Support for \\"subset\\" coverage areas whereby a particular customer can be restricted to a smaller area of coverage *Network level call confirmation (rather than end to end success/failure detection) *Seamless roaming based upon \\"vote now\\" procedures controlled from a central controller, based on RSSI hysteresis or similar *Registration upon site change *Graceful failure modes defined at protocol level *Data transfer facilities *Presence awareness at network level which only invokes the transmitter sites necessary for call establishment *Centralized control with a degree of over-air control of terminals (such as barring units, etc.) *ESN based terminal security or similar *True and proven interoperability between manufacturers dictated by an open standard *Little flexibility for custom deviations from standard, ensuring all terminals comply with standard *Uniform user terminal standard with respect to user interface, tones, dialling schemes, etc. Such a requirement list dictates that a dedicated control channel with central control (little mobile terminal intelligence) will be used. MPT1327 was the first mainstream system to meet the requirements of a high tier network and is currently (2015) still by far the world's most successful trunked radio network protocol. DMR/dPMR does not currently appear on this list due to lack of mature standard (is still under active development), does not meet manufacturer interoperability requirements currently, has significant vendor lock-in issues and has no clearly defined user terminal interface standard. NXDN Common Air Interface (CAI) was accepted at the meeting of the ITU-R (International Telecommunications Union Radiocommunications Sector) held in November 2016 and it has been added to Report M.2014-3, published in February 2017. It is an open, multi-vendor protocol widely adopted in mission-critical applications in Japan, USA and mainland Europe. #MPT-1327 #TETRA #APCO Project 25 #TETRAPOL #NXDN Notes Category:Radio resource management Category:Radio networks ","title":"Trunked radio system"},{"id":"1903272","text":"The Dardo is an infantry fighting vehicle designed for the Italian Army as a replacement for the M113 APC. It is designed and built by the Iveco Fiat Oto Melara Syndicated Company based in Rome. Iveco is responsible for the hull and propulsion systems, while Oto Melara is responsible for the weapons and fire control systems. Description =Armament= The Dardo is primarily armed with the 25mm Oerlikon KBA automatic cannon firing 600 rounds per minute, with 200 rounds of ready to fire ammunition stored in the turret. Two 7.62mm NATO machine guns are also installed in the turret, one coaxially mounted with the main gun. Five rifle ports, two on each side of the hull and one in the rear are provided to allow troops inside to use their personal weapons, if needed. Fire control is provided by the Galileo Avionica Hitfist integrated fire control system, which is capable of measuring target speed and range. The commander is provided with six episcope sights, which provide 360¬∞ field of view. The cupola can be further fitted with a panoramic stabilised sight. Additionally, a laser range finder and a thermal imager are provided for the gunner. The commander is equipped with a monitor that displays the view from the gunner night vision system. For dealing with heavy armoured threats, two Spike-LR anti tank missiles can be installed, one on each side of the turret. These missiles have a maximum range of 4 km. =Self protection= The Dardo hull is built from welded aluminum alloy with add on steel armour plates for increased protection. Over the frontal arc, the vehicle is protected against 25mm APDS projectiles. The side armour protects against 14.5mm API projectiles. Four 80mm smoke grenade launchers are installed on each side of the turret. =Propulsion= Dardo in action Dardo in Afghanistan The Dardo is powered by an Iveco V6 turbo-charged after-cooled diesel engine delivering 512 hp (382.2 kW). This drives a ZF-designed automatic transmission system, which is manufactured under license by Iveco Fiat. The transmission system has four forward and two reverse gears, and incorporates the steering system and the hydraulic retarder. The running gear consists of six dual rubber-lined road wheels, with three return rollers on each side and connector type tracks. The suspension consists of a torsion bar, bumper and a hydraulic shock absorber on each suspension arm. Disc brakes on each of the final drives controlled by a transmission retarder provide the braking. Together, this allows the Dardo to achieve speeds in excess of 70 km/h, maneuver on gradients of more than 60% and ford waters up to a depth of 1.5 m. Future variants The Dardo IFVs currently in service with the Italian Army are fitted with the \\"Hitfist\\" IFV turret. The chassis is intended to be the basic model of a family of vehicles, which may include a 120 mm mortar carrier, command (C3I) vehicle, ambulance and light tank with a 105mm gun turret.

The film also marked the first significant role in a major film for Rita Hayworth.Frankel, Mark. \\"Articles: Only Angels Have Wings (1939).\\" Turner Classic Movies. Retrieved: October 22, 2012. It is generally regarded as being among Hawks' finest films, particularly in its portrayal of the professionalism of the pilots of the film, its atmosphere, and the flying sequences. The supporting cast features Thomas Mitchell and Richard Barthelmess. Only Angels Have Wings was based on a number of real incidents witnessed by Hawks, and although Air Mail (1932), Night Flight (1933), Ceiling Zero (1936, also directed by Hawks) and Flight From Glory (1937) have similar stories, they are not related. In 2017, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". Plot Jean Arthur as Bonnie Lee Geoff Carter (Grant) is the head pilot and manager of Barranca Airways, a small, barely solvent company owned by \\"Dutchy\\" Van Ruyter (Sig Ruman) carrying airmail from the fictional South American port town of Barranca through a high pass in the Andes Mountains. Bonnie Lee (Arthur), a piano-playing entertainer, arrives on a banana boat one day. After making her acquaintance, Joe Souther (Noah Beery Jr.) crashes and dies trying to land in fog later that day. Bonnie becomes infatuated with Geoff, despite his fatalistic attitude about the dangerous flying, and stays on in Barranca (not at his invitation, as he insists on telling her). The situation is complicated by the arrival of pilot Bat MacPherson (Richard Barthelmess) and his wife (and Geoff's old flame) Judy (Rita Hayworth). McPherson cannot find work in the United States because he once bailed out of an airplane, leaving his mechanic ‚Äî the brother of \\"Kid\\" Dabb (Thomas Mitchell), Carter's best friend ‚Äî to die in the ensuing crash. When Geoff is forced to ground the Kid because of failing eyesight, he hires MacPherson on the understanding that he will get the most dangerous assignments. Dutchy will secure a lucrative government contract if he can provide reliable mail service during a six-month trial. On the last day of the probation period, bad weather closes the mountain pass. Geoff decides to try to fly a new Ford Trimotor over the mountains instead. The Kid asks to go with him as co-pilot. Geoff refuses, but then lets the Kid toss a coin to decide the matter. When it lands on the floor, Geoff discovers that the coin has two heads. Geoff still agrees to take him along. Just before leaving, Bonnie tries to talk Geoff out of going. She takes his gun out of his holster and points it at him. When she realizes that she cannot stop him, she drops the gun on the table, but it accidentally fires, hitting Geoff in the shoulder. Unable to fly, Geoff lets MacPherson take his place. However, MacPherson and the Kid are unable to climb high enough; the plane stalls and drops thousands of feet before leveling off. Geoff tells them to turn around, but they decide to try to fly through the fogged-in pass. In the pass, they encounter a flock of condors. One crashes through the windshield, paralyzing the Kid; another hits the No. 1 engine, setting it on fire. Later the No. 2 engine also catches fire. The Kid tells MacPherson to bail out, but he refuses. He turns around and returns to Barranca, managing to crash-land the burning Trimotor on the field. The Kid dies from a broken neck, but not before telling Geoff what MacPherson did. As a result, MacPherson is finally accepted by the other pilots. Confrontation between MacPherson and the Kid Bonnie is torn between leaving and staying, and confronts Geoff in the hope he will ask her to stay. However, Geoff does not. Then, with mere hours to spare on the trial period, the weather clears and Geoff has to rush off to secure the all- important contract. Before he goes, he offers to toss a coin to decide: heads, she stays; tails, she leaves. Discouraged, Bonnie gives up. As he leaves, however, Geoff gives her the coin as a \\"souvenir.\\" At first, she is distraught, but then she discovers that the coin has heads on both sides.

Retrieved: October 22, 2012. While he was scouting locations several years earlier, for the filming of Viva Villa!, Hawks had been especially inspired by the stoic aviation personnel that he had met in Mexico.McCarthy 1997, pp. 266‚Äì267. The film's final script was written and re- written throughout the film's production, mostly by Hawks and Jules Furthman, but also with contributions by Eleanore Griffin and William Rankin.McCarthy 1997, p. 268. Hawks had previously worked with Cary Grant the year before on Bringing up Baby and this was the second of five collaborations between the director and star.McCann 1997, p. 149. He cast Jean Arthur in the leading role of Bonnie Lee after appraising her acting in several films made by Frank Capra.Eliot 2005, p. 196. Hawks then hired silent film star Richard Barthelmess for the role of Bat MacPherson. Barthelmess's career had gradually diminished since sound films became popular in the late 1920s, and he was a controversial choice, mainly because he had recently had a botched plastic surgery operation on the skin under his eyes that resulted in permanent X-shaped scars under both of his eyes. Barthelmess usually wore heavy make-up to hide the scars, but Hawks wanted to use the scars for the character.McCarthy 1997, p. 270. Hawks had originally cast Dorothy Comingore in the role of Judy MacPherson, but studio head Harry Cohn had been grooming a young starlet that would be advanced for the role. With backing from Cohn, her agent then insisted that Hawks give Rita Hayworth a screen test, which eventually resulted in Hayworth being cast in the role.McCarthy 1997, p. 271. =Filming= Shooting of Only Angels Have Wings began on December 19, 1938 at the Columbia Studio Ranch and Hawks shot the film in chronological sequence whenever possible.McCarthy 1997, p. 272. Hawks and Arthur initially found working together difficult and Arthur would often argue with Hawks on set. Hawks was attempting to coach Arthur to play a variation of the classical \\"Hawksian Woman Archetype\\", but Arthur often felt uncomfortable with his direction.Oller 1997, p. 112. Eventually, she unhappily agreed to play the role as he directed her. Years later after Arthur saw Lauren Bacall's performance in To Have and Have Not, Arthur apologized to Hawks and told him that she finally understood what he had wanted from her (epitomized in Bacall's repetition and emphasis on the paradoxical line \\"I'm hard to get ... all you have to do is ask me.\\") Hawks later said that he considered Arthur to have been good in the film. Initial shooting was completed on March 24, 1939, 31 days over its shooting schedule. This was followed with several weeks of second unit shooting of aircraft flying in various locations in the western United States. A few re-takes were shot in April with Cary Grant and Victor Kilian. Two days of re-shoots with Rita Hayworth were also shot, but were directed by Charles Vidor.McCarthy 1997, p. 274.

Only Angels Have Wings has become very popular among enthusiasts of the aircraft of the golden age of aviation.Harwick and Schnepf 1989, p. 60. Release and reception Twelve days after the film's final re- shoots were completed, Only Angels Have Wings premiered in Los Angeles at the Pantages Theater on May 10, 1939. Its official world premiere occurred the next day at Radio City Music Hall. It was heavily promoted by Columbia Studios and ended up making $143,000 on its initial two-week run at radio City Music Hall, and earned over one million dollars overall. It was the third-highest- grossing film of 1939. The film was also Rita Hayworth's breakout role and helped make her a major Hollywood star, with Hayworth appearing on the cover of Look magazine after the film's success.McCarthy. p. 275. Only Angels Have Wings received good reviews on its release, with Abel Green of Variety comparing it favorably to Flight From Glory and praised Barthelmess's performance. Frank S. Nugent in his review for The New York Times focused on the excitement found in the aerial scenes, also recognizing the talents of the star-studded cast, \\"Mr. Hawks has staged his flying sequences brilliantly ...

Legacy Only Angels Have Wings has become thought of as one of Hawks's best films, with Dave Kehr calling it the \\"equilibrium point\\" of Hawks's career, bridging themes developed in his early films of the 1930s to some of his darker films of the 1940s and 1950s.

His sister later told him that their mother had killed her own father, their grandfather. On his 21st birthday, 12 December 1971, his mother confirmed this, and revealed that it had occurred on 12 December 1945, exactly five years before he was born, which was why there were no celebrations of his own birthday. His mother was charged with murder but acquitted on the ground of extreme provocation after years of alcohol- fuelled violence. She in turn was abusive towards her own son, often telling him he was stupid and worthless, making him walk down the street in his sister's dresses as a punishment, and telling him he was \\"behind the door when looks were given out\\". His father was also abusive when he was around, but he was an interstate truck driver who was not often home.

In the early 1970s he walked out of his Australian literature studies at Melbourne's La Trobe University. The subject of a tutorial was Patrick White's novel The Tree of Man. Nowra stood up, said he thought it was dreadful, walked out and never returned to finish his degree. He later had a difficult personal relationship with Patrick White. White championed Nowra's early work (Visions, Inside the Island), even taking out a paid advertisement in The Sydney Morning Herald when they refused to publish his letter admonishing the theatre critic H. G. Kippax, who had been negative about the plays. But Nowra never liked White's work. White could also be very negative about Nowra. He attended the premiere of Nowra's translation of Rostand's Cyrano de Bergerac, but left the auditorium before the start because he thought, sight unseen, it would be uninteresting. His partner Manoly Lascaris refused to leave, so White sat out the performance in the foyer.

It is a coal mining town and at the 2016 census had a population of 8,735. In addition to the permanent population, Moranbah also has a large fly-in fly-out population in excess of 1500 who work in Moranbah's mines. Moranbah services the Peak Downs Mine, Goonyella Riverside Mine, Broadmeadow Mine, Moranbah North coal mine, North Goonyella coal mine and several other smaller mines in the region. Although one of the newest towns in the region, its central location and large population has made it the seat of the Isaac Regional Council. History The first European to explore the region was Ludwig Leichhardt in January 1845 and settled by pastoralists in the 1850s. Moranbah was established in 1969. The town was rapidly expanded in the late 1970s by the Utah Development Company to house mine workers. The town has been featured twice (once in 1977 and again in 2012) on Four Corners, an investigative news program, exploring the effects of Australia's various mining booms on local rural communities. Moranbah Post Office opened on 1 March 1971. Moranbah State School opened on 1 January 1971 with a secondary department, which became Moranbah State High School on 25 January 1976. Moranbah East State School opened on 27 January 1981. In the Moranbah had a population of 8,965 people. In the Moranbah had a population of 8,735 people. Approximately 100,000 workers have been employed in coal mining over Moranbah's 50-year history. Recreation Moranbah is a thriving community. For a small regional town it offers a diverse range of sports and entertainment facilities including a skate park, library, public swimming pool, soccer, rugby league, golf course, AFL, hockey, tennis, off-road racing, motocross and a BMX club. Isaac Regional Council operates a public library located at Grosvenor Complex, Batchelor Parade, Town Square. The Moranbah branch of the Queensland Country Women's Association meets at the QCWA Meeting Room at Town Square. Peak Range National Park is located to the west of the town.

In microlithography typically radiation transfer casts an image of a time constant mask onto a photosensitive emulsion (or photoresist).R. Menon et al., Materials Today, Feb. 2005, pp. 26-33 (2005). Traditionally mask aligners, steppers, scanners, but also other non- optical techniques for high speed replication of microstructures are common. The concept takes advantage of high speed or parallel manipulation technologies that have been enabled by large and cheap available computing capacity, which is not an issue with the standard approach that decouples a slow, but precise structuring process for writing a mask from a fast and highly parallel copy process to achieve high replication throughputs as demanded for in industrial microstructuring. Maskless lithography follows two main paths. One is a rasterized approach by generation of a time-variant intermittent image on an electronically modifiable (virtual) mask that is projected with known means (also known as Laser Direct Imaging and other synonyms), or by direct writing, where the radiation is focused to a narrow beam that is scanned in vector form across the resist. The beam is then used to directly write the image into the photoresist, one or more pixels at a time. Also combinations of the two approaches are known and it is not limited to optical radiation, but also extends into the UV, includes electron-beams and also mechanical or thermal ablation via MEMS devices. A key advantage of maskless lithography is the ability to change lithography patterns from one run to the next, without incurring the cost of generating a new photomask. This may prove useful for double patterning or compensation of non-linear material behaviour (e.g. when utilizing cheaper, non-cristalline substrate or to compensate for random placement errors of preceding structures). The main disadvantages are complexity and costs for the replication process, the limitation of rasterization in respect to oversampling causes aliasing artefact, especially with smaller structures, while direct vector writing is limited in throughput. Also the digital throughput of such systems forma a bottleneck for high resolutions, i.e. structuring a 300mm diameter wafer with its area of ~707cm¬≤ requires about 10 TiB of data in a rasterized format without oversampling and thus suffers from step-artefacts (aliasing). Oversampling by a factor of 10 to reduce these artefacts adds another two orders of magnitude 1 PiB per single wafer that has to be transferred in ~1 min to the substrate to achieve high volume manufacturing speeds. Industrial maskless lithography is therefore currently only widely found for structuring lower resolution substrates, like in PCB-panel production, where resolutions ~50¬µm are most common (at ~2000 times lower throughput demand on the components). Forms Currently, the main forms of maskless lithography are electron beam and optical. In addition, focused ion beam systems have established an important niche role in failure analysis and defect repair. Also, systems based on arrays of mechanical and thermally ablative probe tips have been demonstrated. =Electron beam= The most commonly used form of maskless lithography today is electron beam lithography. Its widespread use is due to the wide range of electron beam systems available accessing an equally wide range of electron beam energies (~10 eV to ~100 keV). This is already being used in wafer-level production at eASIC, which uses conventional direct- write electron beam lithography to customize a single via layer for low-cost production of ASICs. Most maskless lithography systems currently being developed are based on the use of multiple electron beams.T. H. P. Chang et al., Microelectronic Engineering 57-58, pp. 117-135 (2001). The goal is to use the parallel scanning of the beams to speed up the patterning of large areas. However, a fundamental consideration here is to what degree electrons from neighboring beams can disturb one another (from Coulomb repulsion). Since the electrons in parallel beams are traveling equally fast, they will persistently repel one another, while the electron lenses act over only a portion of the electrons' trajectories. =Optical= Direct laser writing is a very popular form of optical maskless lithography, which offers flexibility, ease of use, and cost effectiveness in R&D; processing. This equipment offers rapid patterning at sub-micrometre resolutions, and offers a compromise between performance and cost when working with feature sizes of approximately 200 nm or greater. Interference lithography or holographic exposures are not maskless processes and therefore do not count as \\"maskless\\", although they have no 1:1 imaging system in between. Plasmonic direct writing lithography uses localized surface plasmon excitations via scanning probes to directly expose the photoresist. For improved image resolution, ultraviolet light, which has a shorter wavelength than visible light, is used to achieve resolution down to around 100 nm. The main optical maskless lithography systems in use today are the ones developed for generating photomasks for the semiconductor and LCD industries. In 2013, a group at Swinburne University of Technology published their achievement of 9 nm feature size and 52 nm pitch, using a combination of two optical beams of different wavelengths. DLP technology can also be used for maskless lithography. =Focused ion beam= Focused ion beam systems are commonly used today for sputtering away defects or uncovering buried features. The use of ion sputtering must take into account the redeposition of sputtered material. =Probe-tip contact= IBM Research has developed an alternative maskless lithography technique based on atomic force microscopy.P. Vettiger et al., IBM J. Res. Dev. 44, pp. 323-340 (2000). In addition, Dip Pen Nanolithography is a promising new approach for patterning submicrometer features. Future Technologies that enable maskless lithography is already used for the production of photomasks and in limited wafer-level production. There are some obstacles ahead of its use in high-volume manufacturing. First, there is a wide diversity of maskless techniques. Even within the electron- beam category, there are several vendors (Multibeam, Mapper Lithography, Canon, Advantest, Nuflare, JEOL) with entirely different architectures and beam energies. Second, throughput targets exceeding 10 wafers per hour still need to be met. Third, the capacity and ability to handle the large data volume (Tb-scale) needs to be developed and demonstrated. In recent years DARPA and NIST have reduced support for maskless lithography in the U.S. There was a European program that would push the insertion of maskless lithography for IC manufacturing at the 32-nm half-pitch node in 2009. EU forms new maskless litho group Project name was MAGIC, or \\"MAskless lithoGraphy for IC manufacturing\\", in frame of EC 7th Framework Programme (FP7). Due to the increased mask costs for multiple patterning, maskless lithography is once again increasing in visibility.

Legal issues with former associates Alfa Romeo prevented Ferrari from creating the Ferrari marque. The 815 raced at the 1940 Brescia Grand Prix, where both entries failed to finish due to engine problems. One of the cars was later scrapped, while the other is currently in a car collection in Italy. Background In 1938, Ferrari left Alfa Romeo after running Scuderia Ferrari as their racing division. The agreement ending their association forbade Ferrari from restarting Scuderia Ferrari within the next four years. Ferrari then founded Auto Avio Costruzioni (AAC) in Modena to manufacture aircraft parts and machine tools for the Italian government. AAC specialized in the production of hydraulic grinding machines used to produce ball bearings. The company established business partnerships with other Italian firms, including Compagnia Nazionale Aeronautica and Piaggio. In December 1939, AAC was commissioned by Lotario, Marquis di Modena, to build and prepare two racing cars for him and Alberto Ascari to drive in the 1940 Mille Miglia. The race, which was officially named the Grand Prix of Brescia, was to be run in April 1940. The resulting car was named the AAC Tipo 815. Details The 815 was designed and developed by ex-Alfa Romeo engineers Alberto Massimino and Vittorio Bellentani and by Enrico Nardi. The designation \\"815\\" was based on the car's eight-cylinder, 1.5 L engine. This engine was largely based on the four-cylinder, 1.1 L engine of the Fiat 508 C Balilla 1100. In concept, it was two 508C engines placed end to end, but it used a specially designed aluminium block built by Fonderia Calzoni in Bologna for integrity and light weight and a five-bearing crankshaft and a camshaft designed and built by AAC to get the traditional straight-8 timing and balance. The engine used Fiat valve gear, cylinder heads (two 508C heads per engine), and connecting rods. The engine was high-tech for the time, with a single camshaft in block, two valves per cylinder, and a semi-dry sump lubrication system. Four Weber 30DR2 carburettors were specified for a total output of at 5500 rpm. The 815 used a Fiat four-speed transmission with the Fiat gears replaced by gears made in-house by AAC. The transmission was integral to the engine block. The car had independent Dubonnet suspension with integral shock absorber at front, with a live axle on semi-elliptic leaf springs and hydraulic shock absorbers at the rear. As Mille Miglia regulations required that racing car chassis be based on production models, the AAC 815's chassis was also derived from the Fiat 508 C Balilla. The bodywork was done by Carrozzeria Touring using Itallumag 35, an aluminium/magnesium alloy, and was done in long, flowing forms with integrated wings. The bodywork weighed . The complete car weighed and attained a maximum speed close to . Performance at 1940 Brescia Grand Prix Both AAC 815s at the 1940 Mille Miglia. #65 (front) is Lotario Rangoni and co-driver Enrico Nardi, #66 (back) is Alberto Ascari and co-driver Giovanni Minozzi. Two 815s, numbers 020 and 021, were completed and entered in the 1940 Brescia Grand Prix, which ran nine laps of a street circuit. Rangoni and Nardi raced in 020, while Ascari and Giuseppe Minozzi raced in 021. After leading the 1500 cc class in the first lap, Ascari's car developed valve problems and broke down. Rangoni then took the lead, set the lap record for the class, and had a lead of more than half an hour when his engine failed after seven laps. After the Second World War Car no. 020 was sent to a scrapyard by Lotario Rangoni in 1938, following an accident. Lotario died during the Second World War and his brother, Rolando, inherited the car. Rolando attempted to recover the car from the scrapyard in 1958. After locating the car and confirming its identity with Enzo Ferrari, he returned to collect it only to find it had been crushed during his absence, irreversibly destroying it. Ascari's car, no. 021, was sold to racer Enrico Beltracchini who raced it in 1947. After selling the car to a museum and then buying it back, Beltracchini sold it again to Mario Righini. As of 2020, Type 815 no. 021 was still in Righini's collection, housed at Anzola dell'Emilia near Modena.

The oldest art objects in the world were discovered in a South African cave. Archaeologists have discovered two sets of art kits thought to be 100,000 years old at a cave in South Africa. The findings provide a glimpse into how early humans produced and stored ochre ‚Äì a form of paint ‚Äì which pushes back our understanding of when evolved complex cognition occurred by around 20,000 ‚Äì 30,000 years. Also, dating from 75,000 years ago, they found small drilled snail shells could have no other function than to have been strung on a string as a necklace. South Africa was one of the cradles of the human species. The scattered tribes of Khoisan and San peoples moving into South Africa from around 10000 BC had their own art styles seen today in a multitude of cave paintings. They were superseded by Bantu and Nguni peoples with their own vocabularies of art forms. In the present era, traditional tribal forms of art were scattered and re-melded by the divisive policies of apartheid. New forms of art evolved in the mines and townships: a dynamic art using everything from plastic strips to bicycle spokes. In addition to this, there also is the Dutch-influenced folk art of the Afrikaner Trek Boers and the urban white artists earnestly following changing European traditions from the 1850s onwards, making for an eclectic mix which continues to evolve today.  Paleolithic Rock Art Sandstone with bushmen rock paintings, Karoo System, (Amathole Mountains, South Africa) The pre-Bantu peoples migrating southwards from around the year 30,000 BC were nomadic hunters who favoured caves as dwellings. Before the rise of the Nguni peoples along the east and southern coasts and central areas of Africa these nomadic hunters were widely distributed. It is thought they entered South Africa at least 10 years ago. They have left many signs of life, people toilets and rocks ('Bushman' paintings) depicting hunting, domestic and magic-related art. There is a stylistic unity across the region and even with more ancient art in the Tassili n'Ajjer region of northern Africa, and also in what is now desert Chad but was once a lush landscape. The figures are dynamic and elongate, and the colours (derived probably from earthen and plant pigments and possibly also from insects) combine ochreous red, white, grey, black, and many warm tones ranging from red through to primary yellow. Common subjects include hunting, often depicting with great accuracy large animals which no longer inhabit the same region in the modern era, as well as: warfare among humans, dancing, domestic scenes, multiple images of various animals, including giraffes, antelope of many kinds, and snakes. The last of these works are poignant in their representation of larger, darker people and even of white hunters on horseback, both of whom would supplant the 'Bushman' peoples. Many of the 'dancing' figures are decorated with unusual patterns and may be wearing masks and other festive clothing. Other paintings, depicting patterned quadrilaterals and other symbols, are obscure in their meaning and may be non-representational. Similar symbols are seen in shamanistic art worldwide. This art form is distributed from Angola in the west to Mozambique and Kenya, throughout Zimbabwe and South Africa and throughout Botswana wherever cave conditions have favoured preservation from the elements. Contemporary Art in South Africa The contemporary art scene in South Africa is as diverse and vibrant as the population and cultures in the country. Contemporary artists in South Africa have adopted new media technologies to produce varied and creative bodies of work, as seen in the work of Dineo Seshee Bopape and CUSS Group. Their art gives insight into the pressing issues of South African society. On a global scale, contemporary South African art is relevant and sought-after. A charcoal and oil on canvas work by leading South African contemporary artist William Kentridge was sold on auction for R3,5 million in London in 2012.  Black Art Post-Apartheid  The Bantu Education Act of 1955 barred Black South Africans from receiving formal art training during the years of apartheid and as a result, the artistic movements that had originated from this community have, until recently, been distinctly classified as ‚Äúcraft‚Äù rather than ‚Äúart.‚Äù Informal art centers, that were funded by European states, became one of the few avenues in which Black South Africans could receive some form of artistic development. Throughout this time period from 1947 to the mid-1990s, the first practitioners to receive this informal training began passing down their knowledge to younger generations of practitioners. However, the traditional canon of African art, categorized as ‚Äúfine art‚Äù had been formed in the 20th century by European and U.S. art audiences. South Africa's inequality gap is larger than that of other countries in the world so the audience for art is primarily the rich and not those who are subject to the artistic expression, giving these higher socio-economic groups a gatekeeper status in deciding what is classified as art. After the Soweto Riots of 1976, a new social consciousness emerged that retaliated against the government's policy of segregation and effectively reexamined the classification of certain Black South African artworks. One of the first artistic styles to receive critic attention was Venda sculpting because it aesthetically appealed to white patrons while also maintaining its ‚Äúartistic manifestations of ethnic diversity.‚Äù These sculptures would be considered ‚Äútransitional art‚Äù rather than ‚Äúcraft‚Äù and would gain access into fine art galleries. Other Black artistic expressions such as beadwork, photography, and studio arts have also begun to be slowly integrated into canonical South African art forms. The Johannesburg Biennale's Africus (1995) and Trade Routes (1997) had a significant impact on the cultural awareness of new South African art. These events were among the first exhibitions that revealed the ‚Äúnew South African art‚Äù to the international community, but also other local South Africans. This gave Black South African artists a new platform to express the effects to which apartheid had influenced society. In the post-apartheid regime, artists have now been given an apparatus to protest social issues such as inequality, sexuality, state control over the personal realm, and HIV/AIDS. However, the emphasis to embody many of these social issues within Black South African art has a led to a stereotype that many young artists are now trying to escape. International pressure has been said to once again demand a level of ‚Äòauthenticity‚Äô within South African art that portrays discourse on the topic of apartheid. Scholar Victoria Rovine goes as far as to state that ‚Äúthese exhibitions represent a South Africa that seeks liberation not from apartheid itself but from apartheid as an already predictable subject for artistic production.‚Äù Furthermore, although South African art is not always political, conversations stemming from its interpretation are rarely apolitical and the high demand for apartheid symbols by private collectors have raised concerns over the collection of the art for the sake of nostalgia.

Caribou was named in memory of her predecessor the SS Caribou which was sunk off Port aux Basques by a German U-boat on October 14, 1942 with the loss of 137 passengers and crew. Entering service in 1986, she was built by Versatile Davie in Lauzon, Quebec, and is specifically designed to traverse the route across the Cabot Strait between North Sydney, Nova Scotia and Channel-Port aux Basques, Newfoundland and Labrador. Point Edward, Sydney Harbour in March 2011. A roll-on, roll-off design with a bow visor, Caribou had 2 vehicle decks and 5 decks above, the main passenger deck being Deck 5. She measured 179 metres in overall length and 25 metres in breadth, weighing 27,212 tons. Her capacity included 1,200 passengers and 370 automobiles or 77 tractor trailers. She had up to 106 crewmembers. Caribous design had been commissioned by CN Marine in the early 1980s and was the culmination of years of research into effective icebreaking ship designs. The resulting hull design which Caribou and Joseph and Clara Smallwood were built to is called \\"Gulfspan\\", named in part after the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The \\"Gulfspan\\" hull is unique among Canadian icebreakers in that the ship slices through sea ice, rather than using its weight to ride up onto and crushing the ice underneath. This design permits the sister ships to maintain close to regular operating speed. At the time that Caribou entered service in 1986, CN Marine underwent a restructuring whereby the company was separated from its parent CN Rail and renamed Marine Atlantic. At the same time, CN was beginning the process of abandoning all railway service on the island of Newfoundland, which had been operating as Terra Transport. Several ferry vessels were retired and/or sold at the time that Caribou entered service and these corporate restructuring changes were taking place. Caribou regularly made the Cabot Strait crossing from North Sydney to Channel-Port aux Basques in approximately 5 hours, 30 minutes, however she had been known to break the 5 hour mark in optimum conditions but frequently comes closer to 6 hours as dictated by established schedules. The ship was retired by Marine Atlantic on November 26, 2010 after completing her last run from Port aux Basques to North Sydney. She was laid up in Sydney Harbour until August 31, 2011.

It was opened by the Boston and Albany Railroad in 1886 to serve the growing community of Newton, Massachusetts. The line was closed in 1958 and sold to the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA), which reopened it in 1959 as a light rail line, now known as the D branch of the Green Line. The first section of what became the Highland branch was built by the Boston and Worcester Railroad between Boston and Brookline in 1848. The Charles River Branch Railroad, a forerunner of the New York and New England Railroad, extended the line to Newton Upper Falls in 1852. The B&A; bought the line in 1883 and extended to Riverside, rejoining its main line there. The MTA electrified the line when it rebuilt it for light rail use. The conversion of the Highland branch into a light rail line was pioneering in several ways. Amid a backdrop of failing private passenger service in the United States, it was the first time a government entity in that country had assumed full responsibility for losses on a route. It was also the only example of converting an extant commuter rail line to light rail use.  History  = Precursors = What became the Highland branch was built in stages. The initial segment was the Boston and Worcester Railroad's Brookline branch, which opened on April 10, 1848. This line stretched from a junction with the Boston and Worcester main line south of Governor Square southwest to the current location of the Brookline Village station in Brookline, with an intermediate station at Longwood Avenue.: \\"The entire cost of the branch is not yet ascertained...\\" Construction costs were roughly $42,000. Brookline had previously only been reachable by road (horsecar service on what is now Huntington Avenue did not begin until 1859), and the branch was quickly a success. Based on this success, the Charles River Branch Railroad was founded in 1849 to extend service west from Brookline. Beginning in 1851, the railroad built from Brookline to Newton Upper Falls. This extension opened in November 1852, at a cost not exceeding $253,000.: \\"The cost of the Charles River Branch road to the date of consolidation was $253,808.\\" The line was further extended to Great Plains (later part of Needham) the next year, and to Woonsocket, Rhode Island in 1863. The Charles River Branch Railroad also constructed its own track parallel to the Brookline branch. From 1858, freight trains carrying gravel from Needham quarries to fill the Back Bay for development made up most of the traffic on the line. By the early 1870s the Boston and Worcester had become the Boston and Albany Railroad (B&A;), itself destined to become part of the New York Central Railroad system. The tracks beyond Brookline, which now reached Woonsocket, Rhode Island, belonged to the New York and New England Railroad, a forerunner of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad. New York and New England trains used the B&A;'s route via Brookline to reach Boston. = Suburban service = A 1907 postcard of Waban station A 1910 postcard of Beaconsfield station The citizens of Newton were dissatisfied with their service to Boston and since the early 1870s and had pressured both the Boston and Albany and the New York and New England to improve service, without result. Among these proposals was for the NY&NE; to sell part of its Woonsocket line to the B&A;, which would then build west through Newton Highlands to Riverside, on its main line from Boston to Albany, New York. This would create a loop or \\"circuit\\" between Boston and Riverside. The founding of the Newton Circuit Railroad by a group of Newton citizens in 1882, with the stated goal of completing the circuit by building a line from Brookline to Riverside, prompted the two railroads to take action. In 1883 the New York and New England sold the line between Brookline and Newton Highlands to the B&A; for $411,400. The B&A; completed the missing and opened the new branch on May 16, 1886. To encourage commuter traffic the B&A; offered reduced-fare commutation tickets. The introduction of frequent service to Boston led a population boom in Newton. Three new stations on the extension opened as they were completed: Waban on August 16, 1886; Woodland soon afterwards; and Eliot in December 1888. Between 1905‚Äì1907 the Boston and Albany undertook a project to remove grade crossings along the branch, following a similar project a decade earlier on the main line through Newton. The line's elevation was lowered by as much as in some places in order to permit road traffic to cross overhead. Lower levels were added at Newton Highlands and Newton Centre to accommodate the depressed tracks. At this time service over the line was almost exclusively passenger, with just one scheduled freight train per day. An infill station at Beaconsfield to serve magnate Henry Melville Whitney's Beaconsfield Hotel opened in 1907. The New York Central Railroad had bought the B&A; in 1900 primarily for long-distance service. After the New York Central electrified several suburban lines around New York City, the public asked for similar improvements around Boston. The New York Central studied third-rail electrification of the Highland branch and the main line as far as Framingham in 1911, but did not find it to be cost-effective. The lines instead continued to use steam power until diesel locomotives were substituted around 1950. Trains which traveled from Boston to Riverside via the Highland branch returned via the main line, thus completing the \\"circuit\\". In 1904 a round trip took 1 hour and 15 minutes. The B&A; main line was quadruple- tracked between Boston and Riverside; tracks 3 and 4 were used by suburban trains. After the Needham Cutoff opened in 1906, the New Haven rerouted most trains on the Charles River line via Forest Hills rather than the Highland branch to avoid congestion at the Cook Street junction. From 1911 to 1914, the New Haven operated \\"Needham Circuit\\" service operating via Needham and Newton Highlands. In 1926, the Newton Lower Falls branch was rerouted to join the Highland branch south of Riverside. The branch ran with overhead electrification between Newton Lower Falls and Riverside until 1930, then with locomotives until 1957. By November 1912, the Highland branch had 30 daily round trips, plus several Needham trains operating via Newton Highlands. This frequency dropped by one-quarter by 1919 (with many Highland branch trains not completing the circuit on the main line), then stayed constant for two decades. The B&A; upgraded Brookline Junction to centralized traffic control (CTC) in 1932, improving the flow of traffic between the branch and the main line. By 1950, the Highland branch saw just seven daily round trips. = Sale to MTA = A PCC streetcar at Reservoir in 1967 The Massachusetts state legislature had first proposed replacing the conventional train service on the Highland branch with streetcars running from the Tremont Street Subway in 1926. The next major round of planning in the mid-1940s suggested the same conversion, along with a branch to Needham. The idea returned in the mid-1950s as a combination of factors, both general and specific, made the concept attractive. The commuter rail business had ceased to be profitable for most railroads in the United States. Causes included high structural costs of doing business, loss of demand outside of rush hour, and restrictive regulations. The Boston-area railroads were not immune to these trends, and as the decade wore on sought to end or reduce their money-losing commuter operations. In addition, the extension of the Massachusetts Turnpike over part of the B&A; main line would reduce its capacity going forward. By 1957, daily ridership was just 3,100 passengers. The Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) first proposed buying the Highland branch and rebuilding it as a light rail line in 1956, for a total estimated cost of $9 million. The MTA was attracted to the project because it could extend rapid transit service quickly and cheaply. The state legislature approved the purchase and a total expenditure of $9.2 million on June 20, 1957. By the time the New York Central ended the seven inbound and nine outbound daily trains on May 31, 1958, daily patronage on the branch had fallen to 2,200 passengers. The MTA bought the Highland branch from the Boston and Albany on June 24, 1958 for $600,000. Even as the MTA took this action, the Boston and Maine Railroad was reducing service on its lines radiating out of North Station and the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad threatened to end all service on the Old Colony Railroad lines. A train at Eliot station in 2016 Construction on the new light rail line began on July 10, 1958. A new -long tunnel was built to connect with the existing Beacon Street Line tunnel west of Kenmore Square. Streetcar stations with automobile parking were built at all the former station sites; Riverside and Woodland were both relocated to the southeast. Additional construction included a yard at Riverside; a loop, busway, and connection with the existing yard at Reservoir; an additional station at Park Drive; and overhead electrification including a new substation at the South Boston power station. The MTA reopened the branch as the Riverside Line on July 4, 1959. Total construction costs came to $8 million. Daily ridership was 25,000, ten times what the B&A; trains had carried at the end. The project was \\"ahead of schedule and under budget\\", and ridership exceeded projections. The faster acceleration of the electric streetcars permitted faster operation between downtown and Riverside (35 minutes versus 40 minutes) than the conventional trains they replaced. While other government entities were subsidizing passenger operations around the United States, it was the only example at that time of a government entity taking on the entire cost of what had been a private operation, and the only case of a commuter rail line converted to light rail. By 1960, the line was estimated to reduce rush hour congestion in downtown Boston by seven percent. Though successful, the conversion was cheaply constructed, and further upgrades were soon needed. From June 1960 to January 1961, the MTA enlarged Riverside Yard and added a maintenance facility, upgraded the power infrastructure, and improved the signalling system. In 1967, the MBTA (which had replaced the MTA in 1964) designated the line as the Green Line D branch as part of systemwide rebranding. Ridership on the surface section of the D branch has remained relatively constant since 1959 - a 2010-2011 count found 24,632 weekday boardings. Short sections of the Highland branch remained connection at both ends for freight service until the 1970s. The Lower Falls branch between Newton Lower Falls and Riverside was out of service after 1972, leaving just the short section at Riverside Yard; the branch was formally abandoned in 1976.  Route  The Highland branch diverged from the Boston and Albany main line at Brookline Junction, adjacent to Fenway Park. From there the branch continued southwest into Brookline. Shadowing the branch for this portion was the \\"Emerald Necklace\\", a partially- completed series of parks and waterways. At Brookline the line turned west and left the Muddy River behind. In Chestnut Hill the line passed south of the Chestnut Hill Reservoir, which opened in 1870. An even closer encounter took place in Newton Centre, where the line ran within a few feet of Crystal Lake. The grade crossing elimination project of 1905‚Äì1907 lowered the line in this area to above the lake's surface level. The B&A; installed a drainage system to mitigate the heightened flood risk. At Newton Highlands the New York and New England Railroad diverged at Cook Street Junction for Woonsocket. The Highland branch turned back toward the B&A; main line, running northwest through Waban. It rejoined the main line at Riverside Junction, from Boston.  Stations  The Richardson-designed former Woodland station building in 1959 The creation of the circuit service over the Highland branch coincided with a \\"major program of capital investment and improvements\\" by the Boston and Albany. Architect Henry Hobson Richardson, who had been involved with the B&A; since 1867 and designed Auburndale station for the railroad in 1881, was commissioned to design several stations for the B&A.; These included the three stations opened on the new section through Newton Highlands (Eliot, Waban, and Woodland), plus a new building (completed in 1884) for the existing Chestnut Hill station. The three new stations were intended to attract real estate development to what were then lightly populated areas. After Richardson's death in 1886, his successor firm of Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge designed a number of additional stations for the B&A;, several of which were for the Highland branch. These included replacements for six of the former NY&NE; stations - Newton Highlands in 1887, Reservoir in 1888, Newton Centre in 1891, Brookline Hills in 1892, and Longwood in 1894 - plus Riverside in 1894. Most originally had their grounds designed by landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted. Ignored in this renewal program was the circa-1870 Brookline station, dismissed by Charles Mulford Robinson in 1902 as \\"disappointing...a brick structure of an earlier date.\\" Most of the stations were demolished during the light rail conversion to provide additional parking spaces. However, four structures remain: the station buildings at Newton Centre, Newton Highlands, and Woodland, plus part of the baggage and express building at Newton Centre. (None of the Olmsted-designed landscaping survived.) On March 25, 1976, the four structures were added to the National Register of Historic Places as the Newton Railroad Stations Historic District. The structures at Newton Centre and Newton Highlands are in use by businesses, while the run-down Woodland station is used for storage by a golf course.

It serves as the state's primary center for multicultural education, with exhibits, programs, and events like the Texas Folklife Festival, an annual celebration of the many ethnicities that make up the population of Texas. It has been held yearly since 1972. The facility, established by the Texas Legislature on May 27, 1965, originally served as the Texas Pavilion at HemisFair '68 before being turned over to the University of Texas System in 1969. UTSA assumed administrative control of the museum in 1973. In 1986, the System designated the Institute as a campus of the University of Texas at San Antonio. Now, it is part of UTSA's HemisFair Campus. It is located near the Alamo and the River Walk. The Institute of Texan Cultures, through its research, collections, exhibits and programs, serves as the forum for the understanding and appreciation of Texas and Texans. The complex has of interactive exhibits and displays. The library on the third floor contains manuscripts, rare books, personal papers, over 3 million historical photos and over 700 oral histories. Funding for the museum comes primarily from three sources: biennial legislative appropriations; exhibit floor and special event admissions; grants, contributions, and other locally generated funds such as the rental of the museum's facilities, and the sale of its publications, audiovisuals, library services, and merchandise from The Museum Store. Major support is provided by the museum's Development Board. The Texas Legislature cut appropriations for the institute by 25% in 2011 causing the institute to rely more on private donations and corporate sponsorship. ITC fulfills its mandate as the state's center for multicultural education by investigating the ethnic and cultural history of the state and presenting the resulting information with a variety of offerings: * Exhibits, programs, and special events designed to entertain, inspire, and educate * A library focusing on ethnic and cultural history * A historical photo collection of more than 3.5 million images * An outreach program to schools and other groups * Teacher-training workshops. There are displays in the museum representing many cultures and their impact on the history and development of Texas. In early 2010, ITC became an affiliate as part of the Smithsonian Affiliates program.http://www.utsa.edu/today/2010/01/itcsmithsonian.html Affiliate status grants the institute access to the Smithsonian‚Äôs artifacts, education, and performing arts programs, expert speakers, teacher workshops, and resources to complement and broaden exhibitions. The Affiliation agreement marks a new era for the institute. A series of upgrades are planned to revitalize main exhibit floor. As UTSA strives to achieve national research university status, the University's museum strives to become a cultural institution of equal caliber.

The interlude may consist of a flashback, a flashforward, a fantasy, a vision, a dream, or some other element. Purposes Commonly, dream sequences appear in many films to shed light on the psychical process of the dreaming character or give the audience a glimpse into the character's past. For instance in Pee- wee's Big Adventure, the purpose of Pee-wee's dreams is to inform the audience of his anxieties and fears after losing his bike. Other times major action takes place in dreams, allowing the filmmaker to explore infinite possibilities, as Michel Gondry demonstrates in The Science of Sleep. Harvard psychologist Deirdre Barrett points out in the book The Committee of Sleep that, while the main content of dream sequences is determined by the film's overall plot, visual details often reflect the individual dream experience of the screenwriter or director. For Hitchcock's Spellbound, Salvador Dal√≠ designed sharply angled sets inspired by his own dream space. Ingmar Bergman lit dream sequences in several films with a harsh glare of light which he says reflects his own nightmares (though most people's have dim light), and Orson Welles designed a scene of The Trial to reflect the manner in which architecture constantly changed in his dreams. Films normally present dreams as a visually accessible or objectively observed space, a discrete environment in which characters exist and interact as they do in the world rather than restricting themselves to the subjective point of view a dream is normally experienced from in real life. In this way films succeed in presenting a coherent dreamed world alongside the diegetic reality of the film. Via transition from one to the next, a film establishes not only the boundaries but resonances between the two worlds. These resonances can reveal a character's subjective observations or desires without breaking away from the objective viewpoint of the narrator, camera, or director with which some theorists, such as Christian Metz, believe the viewer identifies. It is also possible to retroactively explain past plot elements as a dream sequence in order to maintain a plausible continuity in continuing fiction, such as a television series. Such was the case with Dallas, which had killed off Bobby Ewing, one of the more popular characters on the show; when the show's writers decided to bring Bobby back to the show, the tenth-season premiere \\"Return to Camelot\\" revealed that the events between Bobby's death and the end of season nine were all part of a nightmare his wife was having. Techniques Audio or visual elements, such as distinctive music or coloration, are frequently used to signify the beginning and end of a dream sequence in film. It has also become commonplace to distinguish a dream sequence from the rest of the film by showing a shot of a person in bed sleeping or about to go to sleep. Other films show a dream sequence followed by a character waking up in their own bed, such as the dream sequence George Gershwin composed for his film score to Delicious. In classic Hollywood, the wavy dissolve was the standard way to transition between reality and a dream; there would be a close-up of the character having the dream, which would begin shimmering as we crossed over from reality to fantasy. One of the most common contemporary transitions into a fantasy is to zoom in on a character's face and then spin around to the back of that character to reveal that he/she is now standing in an alternate reality. Perhaps the most common technique today is the post-reveal in which a character is shown in an awkward or unusual situation, the scene builds to an even more absurd or unusual situation, and then suddenly there is a cut to the character waking up, as exemplified by the opening sequence of Bring It On where a pep rally with irreverent routines builds into an abnormal moment where a character is revealed topless; she then wakes up to the viewers' realization that she had been dreaming. This is akin to the technique wherein a dream sequence is a plot device in which an entire story has been revealed to be a dream. As opposed to a segment of an otherwise real scenario, in these cases it is revealed that everything depicted was unreal. Often this is used to explain away otherwise inexplicable events. Because it has been done in many occasions to resolve a storyline that seemed out of place or unexpected, it is often considered weak storytelling; a particularly referenced example of this is the TV show Dallas in which the entirety of season 9 was revealed in fact to have been a dream. Furthermore, in-jokes are often made in writing (particularly television scripts) that refer to the disappointment a viewer might feel in finding out everything they have watched was a dream. For example, entire sequences of the Family Guy two-part episode \\"Stewie Kills Lois\\" and \\"Lois Kills Stewie\\" are revealed to have taken place within a virtual reality simulation, upon which a character asks whether a potential viewer could be angry that they have effectively watched a dream sequence, but this technique can also be effective and its use lauded when the status of dream or reality is left more ambiguous as it was in The Wizard of Oz. The camera angles and movements used to depict dream sequences enable this kind of play and confusion between the diegetic reality and the dreamed world by presenting the dream world as a visually accessible space in which the character moves around the same as he does in the diegetic reality, as opposed to restricting themselves cinematographically to a subjective viewpoint even though dreams are generally understood to be experienced by the dreamer from their own subjective point of view. This point is made salient by the films which choose to employ first-person camera angles such as Strange Days (1995) when it depicts recorded memories experienced via the \\"SQUID\\" recorder, the first-person sequence of Doom (2005), the beginning of Enter the Void (2010), and others, and how radically these moments stand out against normal cinematography even when the subject matter is something as subjective as a dream. Many have cited the general impracticality and unattractiveness of sustained first-person perspective in film as a reason for its absence from filmed dream sequences. History A dream sequence in Life of an American Fireman (1903) The dream sequence that Atossa narrates near the beginning of Aeschylus' Athenian tragedy The Persians (472 BCE) may be the first in the history of European theater. The first dream sequence in a film is more contested. Film critic Bob Mondello claims that the first famous movie with a dream sequence was Buster Keaton's Sherlock Jr. (1924). Predating this, Leslie Halpern claims the earliest dream sequence was in Edwin S. Porter's Life of an American Fireman (1903). Earlier than either of these, James Walters points out G.A. Smith's use of a dream sequence in Let Me Dream Again (1900), but is careful to note the precariousness of claiming any film the first to feature a dream sequence given the rapid transnational development of cinema in its early years and that so many films from the period have been lost. Walters traces the dream sequence technique of revealing one thing to be another (revealing what the audience thought was a dream to actually be reality), back to magic lantern shows features \\"slipping\\" or \\"slipper\\" slides in which; some lantern slides for examples would feature two sheets of glass with different images painted on each, say a cocoon and a butterfly. The first sheet would be projected and then the second sheet slid on top of it to reveal a change, such as a butterfly emerging from a cocoon. Dream sequences became very popular in the early period of film following this change of phase format. Alongside this technique, a dream sequence which is introduced by a character falling asleep and then entering the dream sequence also became popular via such films as Edwin S. Porter's Dream of a Rarebit Fiend (1906). What is important to note is these films created a model for dream sequences in which a character's inner thoughts are not represented subjectively (from the character's point of view), but from an objective camera angle that gives the audience the impression less of a character having a dream than of being transported alongside the character into a dreamed world in which the character's actions are captured by the camera in the same way they are the films' real fictional worlds.

He is principally known as a leading twentieth century authority on Vipassana meditation and an influential leader of the Vipassana movement.see Modern Buddhist Masters by Jack Kornfield Life and works Ba Khin was born in Yangon during the British colonial rule in March 1899. He passed the final high school examination, winning a gold medal as well as a college scholarship. Family pressures forced him to discontinue his formal education to start earning money. His first job was with a Burmese newspaper called The Sun, but after some time he began working as an accounts clerk in the office of the Accountant General of Burma. In 1926 he passed the Accounts Service examination, given by the provincial government of India. In 1947, when Burma was separated from India, he was appointed the first Special Office Superintendent. In that same year, in January 1937, Ba Khin met a student of Saya Thet Gyi. Thet Gyi was a wealthy farmer and disciple of the renowned master Ledi Sayadaw, who taught him anapana-sati, a form of meditation taught by the Buddha. When Ba Khin tried it, he experienced good concentration, which impressed him so much that he resolved to complete a full course in Vipassana meditation that Thet Gyi offered at a center he had established for that purpose. Accordingly, Ba Khin applied for a ten-day leave of absence and set out for Thet Gyi's teaching center. Ba Khin progressed well during this first ten-day course, and continued his practise during frequent visits to his teacher's center and meetings with Thet Gyi whenever he came to Rangoon. In 1941, a seemingly happenstance incident occurred which was to be important in his life. While on government business in upper Burma, he met by chance Webu Sayadaw, a monk who was widely recognized as an arahant. Webu Sayadaw was impressed with Ba Khin's proficiency in meditation, and urged him to teach. The monk was the first person to exhort Ba Khin to start teaching.see The way to ultimate calm: selected discourses of Webu Sayadaw by Webu Sayadaw On 4 January 1948, the day Burma gained independence, Ba Khin was appointed first Accountant General of the Union of Burma. In 1950 he founded the Vipassana Association of the Accountant General's Office where lay people, mainly employees of that office, could learn Vipassana meditation. In 1952, the International Meditation Centre (I.M.C.) was opened in Rangoon, two miles north of the Shwedagon Pagoda. Here many Burmese and foreign students received instruction in the Dhamma from Ba Khin. He was also active in the planning for the Sixth Buddhist Council known as Cha·π≠·π≠ha Sa·πÖgƒÅyana (Sixth Recitation) which was held in 1954‚Äì56 in Yangon. Ba Khin finally retired from his outstanding career in government service in 1967. From that time, until his premature death in 1971 stemming from complications of surgery, he stayed at I.M.C. in Burma, teaching Vipassana. Legacy Ba Khin became a notable teacher of vipassanƒÅ meditation. After his death, some of his students established meditation centers in his tradition in various countries. There are six International Meditation Centres organized by the Burmese Buddhist branch of students in the Ba Khin Tradition. Each of these centres in the West is a direct offshoot of the International Meditation Centre of Rangoon, Burma, which was founded by Ba Khin. These centres are guided by his closest disciple Mya Thwin, known to her followers as Mother Sayama Gyi. Another prominent student of Ba Khin is S. N. Goenka. There are over two hundred centres of Vipassana meditation as taught by S. N. Goenka in the tradition of Sayagyi U Ba Khin, located in various countries throughout the world. Worldwide influence *It was Ba Khin's wish that the technique, long lost in India, could again return to its country of origin, and from there, spread throughout the world. Ba Khin made a determined effort to travel to the west to teach Vipassana there. Due to travel restriction in place at that time, he was never able to personally fulfill his wish. When he realized his time was running out, he commissioned the following foreign students and entrusted them with teaching Vipassana in their respective countries.

Derived from axo- (=axon) and -tomy (=surgery). This type of denervation is often used in experimental studies on neuronal physiology and neuronal death or survival as a method to better understand nervous system diseases.\\"Online Medical Dictionary\\" Axotomy may cause neuronal cell death, especially in embryonic or neonatal animals, as this is the period in which neurons are dependent on their targets for the supply of survival factors. In mature animals, where survival factors are derived locally or via autocrine loops, axotomy of peripheral neurons and motoneurons can lead to a robust regenerative response without any neuronal death. In both cases, autophagy is observed to markedly increase. Autophagy could either clear the way for neuronal degeneration or it could be a medium for cell destruction.Rubinsztein DC et al. (2005) Autophagy and Its Possible Roles in Nervous System Diseases, Damage and Repair. Autophagy 1(1):11-22. __TOC__ The Axotomy Response =Peripheral (extrinsic)= This drawing compares a normal neuron to one undergoing chromatolysis after axonal injury. Regeneration after axonal injury may occur. Upon injury of a peripheral axon, the entire neuron immediately reacts in order to regenerate the axon.[Barron, K. D. (2004). The axotomy response. Journal of the Neurological Sciences, 220(1-2), 119-121. doi:10.1016/j.jns.2004.03.009] This reaction requires an increased metabolic activity and is initiated by chromatolysis. Chromatolysis is characterized as the dissolution of protein-producing structures in the cell body of a neuron [(2014). chromatolysis. Oxford Reference. Eds. Martin, E., & McFerran, T. Retrieved 13 Nov. 2014. ] and is a term used to characterize apoptosis of neuronal cells. During chromatolysis, the soma and nucleus round and enlarge, the Nissl bodies and Golgi bodies both disintegrate, and the cytocentrum is cleared. In most cases, the axotomy response in peripheral axons ends in cell healing and regeneration, though it may occasionally end in cell death. Regeneration occurs because of microglial hyperplasia and astroglial hypertrophy, activities that are lacking in the central axotomy response. =Central (intrinsic)= In contrast to the peripheral response, the axotomy response in central neurons (neurons in the Central Nervous System) almost always leads to cell death.[Barron KD. Neuronal responses to axotomy: consequences and possibilities for rescue from permanent atrophy or cell death. The mode of cell death is often apoptosis.Garcia-Valenzuela E, Gorczyca W, Darzynkiewicz Z, Sharma SC. (1994) Apoptosis in adult retinal ganglion cells after axotomy. J Neurobiol 25: 431-438. DOI: 10.1002/neu.480250408 In: Seil FJ, editor. Neural regeneration and transplantation. New York: Liss;1989. p. 79‚Äì99.] Central neurons, upon being severed, generally fail to up-regulate the expression of trophic factors, a type of regeneration-associated protein.[Plunet, W., Kwon, B., & Tetzlaff, W. (2002). Promoting Axona l Regeneration in the Centra l Nervous System by Enhancing the Cell Body Response to Axotomy. Journal of Neuroscience Research, 68, 1-6. Retrieved November 14, 2014.] These trophic factors are responsible for the regulation of neuron vitality [Trophic factors and cytokines. (2004). Journal of Neurochemistry, 88, 90-90. doi:10.1046/j.1474-1644.2003.2314p37_01.x] and are a critical aspect of neuroprotection. Trophic factors guarantee the survival of neuron synapsing, meaning they essentially maintain the functionality of the neuron. The lack of increased expression of these proteins will ultimately lead to cellular atrophy. Surgical axotomy When performing neurosurgery, professionals are often required to intentionally sever axons. Laser axotomy is a technique is under development that allows for precise axon severing. Laser axotomy could enable doctors to better understand the downstream effects of a severed axon so that they can develop more effective treatment arms. Being able to precisely sever specific axons will enable researchers to study direct correlation of axons to functionality. Associated injuries and pathologies Although many times axotomy occurs due to intended surgical treatment, it is also often directly related to one of many pathologies/injuries. The following is a preliminary list of some of the known associated injuries and pathologies. =Multiple sclerosis= Multiple sclerosis is a disease that demyelinates the nerves of the central nervous system, leading to deteriorated bodily function.Axotomy in MS lesion. (1998). Americas Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis, 4, 497‚Äì523. November 14, 2014. The underlying pathologies are mostly unknown and not understood. It is hypothesized by many that the demyelination in multiple sclerosis lesions leads to axonal transection and ultimately axonal degeneration. This axon death could potentially be the cause of the irreversible effects of multiple sclerosis. Using what is known about the axotomy response, doctors and researchers are looking to implement neuro- protective rehabilitation to patients suffering in the early stages of multiple sclerosis in order to prevent the disease from running its course and causing irreversible disability. These rehabilitations would include the utilization of trophic factors to aid in neuron survival and maintenance of synapsing function. =Traumatic Brain Injuries= A traumatic brain injury is defined as a blunt non-missile penetrating or missile injury to the head.[ Blumbergs PC (2005) Pathology. In: Reilly PL, Bullock R (eds) Head injury. Pathophysiology and management. Hodder Arnold, London, pp 41‚Äì72] It has been shown that the extent of the damage incurred after a head trauma correlates more directly with the amount of deformation incurred by the brain than the amount of stress per area applied to the head. There are two modes of axotomy that can occur as a result of a TBI. Primary axotomy occurs immediately and is characterized as complete mechanical transaction of axons. More often, secondary axotomy occurs, evolving over time and ultimately leading to disconnection. While this type of injury is often irreversible, the axons do occasionally recover. Researchers are currently working towards utilizing this potential for recovery to develop therapies for patients suffering from traumatic brain injuries. These therapies rely on the scientific understanding of the axotomy response. Two mechanisms that aid in the reinnervation process are acute inflammation and the activation of molecules in the extracellular matrix surrounding the synapse. Immediate acute inflammation leads to the removal of the severed axons by activating the local glia. The inflammation response also recruits growth factors that aid in the repopulation of postsynaptic sites. The negative effects of this inflammation may be difficult to detect immediately post injury. Inflammation of the head is often slow to onset after injury, and can lead to a fatal rise in cerebral pressure. A recently discovered and understood cytokine is currently being used to try to treat the axotomy before the rise in pressure occurs. This cytokine, called osteopontin, may be able to aid in axon regeneration by exposing its integrin receptor binding sites. Osteopontin secretion may be able to regulate synaptogenesis and target the necessary neuroglia required for the repair of the axons. A study done by Julie L. Chan proves the functionality of osteopontin in initiating the immune response necessary for synaptic repair and reorganization after injury (axotomy).[ Chan, Julie L., Thomas M. Reeves, and Linda L. Phillips. \\"Osteopontin Expression in Acute Immune Response Mediates Hippocampal Synaptogenesis and Adaptive Outcome following Cortical Brain Injury.\\" Experimental Neurology 261 (2014): 757-71. Web.] Though the study effectively proved the functionality of osteopontin in diminishing the intense inflammatory response following a traumatic brain injury, it did not provide evidence of the long-term effects of implanting this as a treatment option. Altering the inflammatory response may unintentional halt the beneficial aspects of inflammation and have devastating effects on the brain's ability to heal itself.

Early life Franz de Paula Maria Karl August was born on 28 August 1853, to Aloys II and Franziska Kinsky in Liechtenstein Castle. He attended the University of Vienna and the University of Prague before serving as the successor to Count Anton Graf von Wolkenstein-Trostburg as the Austro- Hungarian ambassador to the Russian Empire from 1894 to 1898. He was the 1,204th Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece in Austria. He fell in love with Elisabeth von Gutmann, a widow who had converted to Roman Catholicism from Judaism in 1899, but his brother Johann disapproved of the relationship and refused to consent to it. In 1919, he secretly married Gutmann in Salzberg and remarried her following Johann's death on 22 July 1929. In 1937, Franz founded the Order of Merit of the Principality of Liechtenstein on the anniversary of his marriage. Reign On 11 February 1929, Johann II died passing the title of Prince of Liechtenstein to Franz. A few weeks after he took the title 395,360 acres of land belonging to the Liechtenstein family was seized by Czechoslovakia. A delegation of farmers petitioned him to establish a republic in Liechtenstein, but ended their attempts when he stated that he would not give any his money towards the country forcing it to rely solely on taxation. In 1937, Prime Minister Josef Hoop admitted that Austrian pretender Otto von Habsburg was living in Liechtenstein Castle as a guest of Franz I in order to be closer to Austria rather than in his previous residence of Steenokkerzeel, Belgium. An extradition treaty was also signed between Liechtenstein and the United States. He had no children so his nephew Prince Aloys was heir presumptive, but Aloys removed himself from the line of succession in favor of his son, Franz Joseph, in 1923. On 31 March 1938, he made his grandnephew Franz Joseph his regent following the Anschluss of Austria. After making his grandnephew regent he moved to Feldberg, Czechoslovakia and on 25 July, he died while at one of his family's castles, Castle Feldberg, and Franz Joseph formally succeeded him as the Prince of Liechtenstein. Although Franz stated that he had given the regency to Franz Joseph due to his old age it was speculated that he did not wish to remain in control of the principality if Nazi Germany were to invade.

After several generations, a sense of Basque heritage is still strong, maintained through numerous Basque cultural centres in major cities. Argentine sportspeople with Basque surnames have frequently been nicknamed El Vasco. = Chile = The Basques arrived in Chile in the 18th century from their homeland in northern Spain (see Basque Provinces) and parts of southwestern France, as merchants and due to their hard work and entrepreneurship, rose to the top of the social scale and intermarried into the Chilean elites of Castilian descent. This union is the basis of the Chilean elite of today. The Basque settlers also intermarried into the native American population of central Chile in the middle of the colonial period to form the large mestizo population that exists in Chile today; mestizos create modern middle and lower classes; other Basque settlers also intermarried with mestizos of Castilian descent. Thousands of Basque refugees fleeing Spanish Civil War in 1939 also settled and have many descendants in the country and have even intermarried with other Spanish ethnic groups other than Castilians as well as other European ethnic groups.

Miguel de Unamuno used to say \\"The Company of Jesus and the Republic of Chile are the two great achievements of the Basque people.\\" = Colombia = Colombia was one of early focus of Basque immigration; it is estimated that at least 40% of the Coffee Axis and Antioquia's population have Basque origin (2,800,000 persons).Luis Gorostiza (1912) Between 1640 and 1859, 18.9% of the residents of Colombia were of Basque origin, making it possible for demographers to predict that nowadays more than half of the country has this ancestry (25,000,000 persons). It has been suggested that the present day incidence of business entrepreneurship in the region of Antioquia is attributable to the Basque immigration and Basque character traits. The current Spanish dialect in Antioquia, closely observed, has obvious influences from Basque. Basque influence is evident in words such as 'ma' (mother), 'coscorria' (useless, inept) and 'tap' (tap), to name only a few cases. Basque also influenced the pronunciation of the letter 's' apico-alveolar, so in the Antioquia, and the letter \\"ll\\" (double L) pronounced as a fricative, not to overlook the inclusion of the letter \\"a\\" before certain initial Rs: instead of , instead of and instead of . Basques began to immigrate regularly and are distributed throughout the country. Due to this presence is that the Colombian department of Antioquia has been considered a major route of the Basque- Navarre immigration, mainly during the colonial era, when hundreds of Basques migrated to be linked to the Spanish colonization companies. It is estimated, for example, for the Department of Antioquia (a region where hundreds of Spaniards arrived, of which a good portion were Basque) some limited aspects of the culture and traditions were brought by Basque settlers. Many point to Basque origins as a way to understand the population's idiosyncrasies. Prominent among these, were two American historians: Everett Hagen and Leonard Kasdan. Hagen looked up the phone in Medellin in 1957 and found that 15% of the surnames were Basques, of Basque origin, finding then that employers in the percentage of surnames was up to 25%, which led it to conclude that the inheritance Basque was very important to explain the increased industrial development of Antioquia in the Colombian context. These ideas were supported by representatives of developmental theories, who sought to justify business growth based on \\"the character of social groups.\\" There also seems to be some Basque gastronomical influence in the Antioquia region.

North America  = Canada = See also History of Newfoundland and Labrador. = Mexico = An estimated of 2% of Mexicans have some amount of Basque descent and that community has increased in size from immigration from Spain in the early 20th century. The Spanish Civil War in the 1930s brought over tens of thousands of refugees from the Basque Country to political asylum in Mexico and Latin America.Los vascos de M√©xico. Siglos XVI-XVIII Most Mexicans of Basque descent are concentrated in the cities of Monterrey, Saltillo, Camargo, and the states of Jalisco, Zacatecas, Durango, Nuevo Le√≥n, Tamaulipas, and Coahuila. The Basques were important in the mining industry, many were ranchers and vaqueros (cowboys), and the rest small shops owners in major cities like Mexico City, Guadalajara and Puebla. Basque names are found in many places throughout north central and Northeastern Mexico, such as Durango, Victoria, Zuazua and Arramberri - the first province in the north of the Viceroyalty of New Spain (Mexico) to be explored and settled by the Spanish, Nueva Vizcaya, comprised the territory of today's states of Chihuahua and Durango. Many notable Mexicans have been of Basque extraction, such as Agust√≠n de Iturbide, emperor of the First Mexican Empire, Sor Juana In√©s de la Cruz, seventeenth century conquistador, Juan de O√±ate, Francisco \\"Pancho\\" Villa, Vicente Fox, as well as directors and actors: Mar√≠a F√©lix, Dolores del R√≠o, and Alejandro Gonz√°lez I√±√°rritu. = United States = A Basque center in Boise Christmas notice partly in Basque(\\"Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!\\" in Basque), also from Boise A Basque pelota in Flagstaff, Arizona. Constructed in 1926. There are about 57,000 people of Basque descent living in the United States, according to the 2000 census. This number is highly disputed, however, since before the 1980 census there had never been a federally recognized category for Basques. As a result, Basques were usually categorized as Spanish or French. It is speculated that there are many more Americans of Basque descent who still classify themselves as Spanish, French or Latin American. The largest concentration of Basque Americans is in the Boise, Idaho, area, where approximately 15,000 Basque Americans live.Jaialdi 2005 kicks off, The Idaho Statesman, July 25, 2005. Boise is home of the Basque Museum and Cultural Center and hosts a large Basque festival known as Jaialdi every five years. A large majority of the Boise Basque community traces its ancestry to Bizkaia (Vizcaya in Spanish, Biscay in English) in northern Spain. In South Texas along the Mexican-Texan border of the Rio Grande Valley, many people are of Basque heritage or have Basque surnames. Along this area are many ranches given to colonial Spanish settlers from Basque Country to New Spain which still exist today. They are mostly descendants of settlers from Spain and Mexico, with a number from other parts of Hispanic America. Other significant Basque populations in the United States are located in Reno, Nevada, and the Central Valley region of California. In Winnemucca, Nevada there is an annual Basque festival that celebrates the dance, cuisine and cultures of the Basque peoples of Spanish, French and Mexican nationalities who arrived in Nevada in the late 19th century. Reno is home to the nation's only Basque Studies Department at the University of Nevada. There also exists a history of Basque culture in Chino, California. In Chino, there are two annual Basque festivals that celebrate the dance, cuisine, and culture of the peoples, and the surrounding area of San Bernardino County has many Basque descendants. There has been a Basque presence in the Americas from the age of Columbus. Basques under the crown of Castile were among the explorers, priests and Conquistadors of the Spanish Empire. Placenames like Durango, Colorado, Trepassey, Biscayne Cove and Biscayne Bay remember their foundations. Basques began to come to English-speaking America during the 1848 California Gold Rush. The first wave of Basques were already part of the diaspora who were living in Chile and Argentina and came when they heard word of the discovery of gold. When the gold rush did not pan out for most Basque immigrants, the majority turned to ranching and sheep-herding in California's Central Valley, and later in northern Nevada and southern Idaho. Many more Basques arrived from the Basque Country upon hearing of the success of their comrades in America. Basque immigration was effectively cut off by the 1921 National Origins Quota Act. Basque immigration was restored by Nevada Senator McCarran's 1952 immigration act, which allowed a quota of 500 Basques (technically 'Spanish Sheep Herders'). = Saint-Pierre et Miquelon = Saint-Pierre et Miquelon is a self-governing territorial overseas collectivity of France, situated in the northwestern Atlantic Ocean near Canada. The name \\"Miquelon\\" is a Basque form of Michael. The islands were frequented by Basque fisherman prior to Portuguese discovery in 1520. Today, there are many people of Basque descent residing there. The Basque flag appears on the unofficial flag of Saint-Pierre et Miquelon. Europe = Soviet Union = During the Spanish Civil War, countries like the United Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands and the Soviet Union (Russia) offered to spare Spanish Republican children from the toil of war. They embarked mainly from the Basque ports in the Bay of Biscay. In 1950s or 1960s many people went to the west of US during World War II, owing to an economic crisis. But in the US, they started working as sheepherders. When arriving there, their conditions were hard because they were living in a place they have never been before, talking in a different language that they did not learn when they were children. But they were alone, they do not have any family or friends there and they can not talk with nobody. Also, the wind and cold winters were terrible for them. To sum up, they look after the sheep and some of them listen to the radio or play the guitar in their long days not to be bored. But since the Soviet Union refused to recognize Francoist Spain, the Spanish children in Russia (mostly born to Basque communists) spent the Second World War and the following decades in the Soviet Union, many of them forming families with Soviet citizens. Some of them migrated to Cuba after the Cuban Revolution. Now the survivors live in Russia as retirees with help from the Spanish governments.  Asia  There is a small, but thriving Basque population based in Asia. Some of the first Christian missionaries in Asia were of Basque descent such as the Jesuit Francis Xavier who died on Sancian Island off the Chinese Coast. The Jesuit Pedro Arrupe was a witness of the Hiroshima atomic bomb in 1945. = Philippines = Basque immigrants comprised part of the Spanish expatriate population of the Philippines during the Spanish colonial period. Most of them were soldiers and sailors in the military and navy of the Spanish Empire, merchants, missionaries, and clergy. Families of Basque ancestry, over time, slowly integrated into the Philippine social landscape, developing themselves into some of the most prominent families in the country. Basque descendants in the Philippines today consider themselves to be Filipinos and remain influential in the business and political sectors of the country. They include the Aboitiz family, the Zobel de Ayala family, the Araneta family and political clans like the Zubiri and the Oz√°miz families.

Its main course is long and the Parna√≠ba River Basin covers .Ramos, T.P.A.; Ramos, R.T.C.; and Ramos, S.A.Q.A. (2014). Ichthyofauna of the Parna√≠ba river Basin, Northeastern Brazil. Biota Neotrop. 14(1). The Parna√≠ba River rises in the Chapada das Mangabeiras range, and flows northeastward to empty into the Atlantic Ocean, being the longest river entirely located within Brazil's Northeast Region. The middle and upper regions of this river are separated by waterfalls, but is otherwise navigable. Ecology The fish species richness in the Parna√≠ba River Basin has traditionally been considered impoverished, but this has been disproven by recent surveys, which have recorded about 140 native species (including several that remain undescribed) and about 40% of these are endemic. One of the basin endemics is the freshwater stingray Potamotrygon signata.Moro, G.I; Charvet, P.; and Rosa, R.S. (2012).

More than 70% of the fish species in the basin are members of either Characiformes or Siluriformes. The fauna in the headwaters has not yet been thoroughly surveyed. In addition to the natives, there are seven introduced fish species in the basin. The river delta is protected by the Delta do Parna√≠ba Environmental Protection Area, created in 1996.

It is the second largest planetarium in the state, the largest being the Adler Planetarium in Chicago, and has the first Carl Zeiss M1015 opto-mechanical star projector installed in the western hemisphere. The Staerkel Planetarium provides science education programs and light show entertainment to as many as 40,000 people each year. It has a 50-foot dome, seats 144, and private group and school show reservations can be made beyond the regular public offerings.http://media.www.prospectusnews.com/features/staerkel-planetarium- the-best-little-known-planetarium-in-illinois-1.2116158 Public shows are every Friday and Saturday evenings. Aside from their regular star shows, the planetarium also hosts a lecture series the first Friday of every month. The planetarium is named after Parkland College‚Äôs founding president, who led the college for the first 20 years. History :‚ÄúThe dream started a long time ago. It began when a group of us, faculty members and administrators together, sat down to develop the specifications for a new college then unbuilt and of course unnamed. Since a basic function of education is to transmit the cultural heritage of a people, we were concerned that the new college would be ideally designed to help teachers accomplish that purpose. :‚ÄúNow over 20 years later the College continues to mature and develop, we see the dream realized with the dedication of Parkland‚Äôs Cultural Center. This is indeed a joyful occasion. To see our dreams come true after all these years gives us a wonderful feeling of pride and satisfaction as we look at this latest addition to this remarkable institution of higher education.‚Äù :‚Äî William M. Staerkel, in a letter written for the October 1st 1987 dedication The William M. Staerkel Planetarium at Parkland College, built as part of the college‚Äôs cultural center, was planned and designed in the late sixties as part of Phase V in the construction of Parkland College‚Äôs campus. The cultural center was divided into two parts, the theatre and the planetarium, which together cost an estimated $4.2 million to build. (News-Gazette) The planetarium was named after Parkland College‚Äôs founding president, who led the college for the first 20 years of its life, during the dedication on 1987-10-01. The planetarium officially opened to the public on 1987-10-22. Equipment =Zeiss Model M1015= The William M. Staerkel Planetarium's Zeiss M1015 The Planetarium uses the Zeiss Model M1015 star projector, manufactured by Carl Zeiss, Inc. of Germany. It is the first of its kind to be installed anywhere in the world. It projects 7,600 stars down to magnitude 6, 25 star clusters and nebulae, the sun, moon, and the five planets visible to the human eye. The Zeiss can show the daily motions of the sky, the sun, the moon, and the positions of the stars on almost any given day, as well as various astronomical grids and scales. Auxiliary equipment allows projection of rainbows, clouds, solar and lunar eclipses, rotating galaxies, double star systems, and varied constellations. =Other equipment= It also consists of its dome, automation, sound and film systems, and projection equipment. The planetarium's projection dome is 50 feet in diameter and at its highest point is 31 feet from the floor of the theater. It consists of perforated aluminum panels that are held together with 7,000 rivets and has approximately 43 million holes in its surface. This allows for acoustic integrity and the placement of effects and speakers behind the dome to be seen or heard throughout the dome. The William M. Staerkel Planetarium uses a specialized automation computer, the MC-10 Media Controller, to automate shows using programmable disks. The MC-10 Media Controller can operate either independently or in conjunction with audio tapes. The Staerkel Planetarium's sound system includes a recording studio and a playback system made up of twelve speakers and two sub-bass enclosures located behind the projection dome. The Staerkel Planetarium has the capability of showing 35mm films and can project an image over more than one-third of the dome surface area. And, in addition to the star projector at the center of the theatre, the planetarium uses 57 carousel slide projectors that can show panoramas to cover the entire dome as well as three CRT projectors which allow for the projection of videos and special effects. Lobby attractions =Solar window= The solar window is a gift given in August 1987 by Dr. and Mrs. William M. Staerkel in memory of their parents and as a tribute to the dedicated Parkland College faculty and staff. The solar window, created by artist Arthur Stern, is an abstract representation of the changing daily path of the sun across the sky, from June (top), when the sun is highest and daylight is longest, to December (bottom), when the sun is lowest and daylight is shortest, and back to June. When the sun shines through the window, embedded prisms split the sunlight into its component colors and cast small rainbow-like patterns called spectra inside the building. These spectral colors are repeated in the colors of the windows. As the rotation of the earth makes the sun appear to travel in its daily arc, the patterns of colors cast by the window and the prisms slowly changes position with the changing position of the sun. =‚ÄúCosmic Blink‚Äù= ‚ÄúCosmic Blink‚Äù, the mural gracing the lobby of the William M. Staerkel Planetarium, is the result of an idea that came to Dr. Staerkel in the spring of 1985 and later monetary donations to the Parkland College Foundation. Painted by Billy Morrow Jackson, artist in residence at the University of Illinois, the mural depicts the timelessness of mankind‚Äôs quest to understand the universe. Celestial objects, constellation figures invented by our ancestors, space-age mechanical explorers and the images then beamed back to us, and the intellectual giants whose investigations peeled away layers of the unknown all are represented in the mural. Jackson pays homage to the continuing, local nature of the quest through inclusion of Dr. Staerkel and representative Parkland students and faculty. Shows and schedule In addition to planetarium shows for schools and the community, outreach services are also offered to schools, libraries, and civic groups. Public shows are held on most Friday and Saturday evenings except for holidays, including late night rock-n-roll light shows featuring the planetarium's 3,000 watt sound system. The Staerkel Planetarium also offer science lectures on the first Friday of each month during Parkland College's Spring (February, March, and April) and Fall (October, November, and December) semesters, as part of the World of Science Lecture Series. The planetarium also occasionally hosts live music performances from avant-garde groups such as Stars of the Lid.

The length of the river is approximately up to the junction with the Grande River, both of which then form the Paran√° River, at the point that marks the borders of the states of S√£o Paulo, Minas Gerais, and Mato Grosso do Sul. Geography Map of the basin of the high Brazilian Paran√°, with details of the source rivers and tributaries The main tributaries of the Parana√≠ba are the S√£o Marcos, the Corumb√°, the Meia Ponte, and the Bois. Major dams on its course are the Barragem de Emborca√ß√£o, Barragem Itumbiara and Barragem de S√£o Sim√£o. Cachoeira Dourada near Itumbiara is one of the most important hydroelectric power stations in Brazil, providing energy to Goi√¢nia and Bras√≠lia. The Parana√≠ba is navigable only in the artificial lake of Ilha Solteira with an extension of 180 km as far as the dam of S√£o Sim√£o. Because of the great pressure to use its resources it shows serious environmental problems. In addition to the erosion of its banks caused by sand extraction and cutting down of the original forest growth, practically 100% of the towns that form its basin dump their sewage \\"in natura\\", including the capital of Goi√¢nia, which dumps 95% of its sewage, untreated, directly into the Meia Ponte river, which then flows into the Parana√≠ba. The Parana√≠ba river is the most important source of the Paran√° river, her source lies in the serra (mountains) of Mata da Corda, municipality \\"Rio Paranaiba\\" (Mato Grosso) at a height of . On the other side of these serra is the source of the Abaete, a tributary of the S√£o Francisco. The confluence of the Parana√≠ba with the Grande river is situated about from the source of the Parana√≠ba. At the unison there is a bridge that is also a border point between three states: S√£o Paulo, Minas Gerais and Mato Grosso do Sul. The Parana√≠ba river is famous for the rich diamond deposits of her tributaries and her huge hydroelectric potential. The Parana√≠ba may best be studied in three separate parts, the high-, the middle- and the lower Paranaiba. =The high Parana√≠ba= NB: of each segment the start km-point (and counting down) beginning with 1,070, the length, the slope etc. will be mentioned. From its headwaters at 1,000 km, a length of 370 km, to km 700, runs with a northerly orientation through the whole extent of the region Minas Gerais at an average height of 760 m, with a slope of 25 cm/km, goes through the town Patos of Minas at a height of 770 m, obtains water from a number of small tributaries that descend from the Magalh√£es-peak and from the Serra of Barba√ßa, on the other side of the Serra da Mata da Corda. At a height of km 729, at a bridge, she receives the water of a small river, the Verde river, close to the place Contendas (Goias) and bends under the bridge perpendicularly to the southeast and takes the border between Minas and Goias. Between km 700 and 800 the slope is 50 cm/km, running in a valley of average width, with broken strictures between km 730 and 732 and between km 783 and 790. The terrains along the river are rolling smoothly and are poorly cultivated. =Middle Parana√≠ba= hydro-electrische centrale van Itumbiara, in Anapora-MG From km 700 to the reservoir of the Dourada (km 330, with a length of 370 km). Between km 575 and 700 the Parana√≠ba receives the following tributaries: At km 661, right bank the S√£o Marcos, at km 633, left bank, the Perdizes river, at km 596, right bank, the Bagagem river. In this segment the river has a slope of 1.2 m/km in a region with generally narrow valleys, steeply sloping banks, rising up to 25 and 60 m. The tributaries of this segment cross diamond containing layers in the \\"zones of the triangle\\" Minas Gerais and Goias. Between km 313 and 575 the Parana√≠ba receives the water of the following tributaries: On the right bank the Verissimo. And the Corumba river (km 436) and the Santa Maria river. And on the right side the Jordao river, the Araguari river (km 469) and the small river Piedade. This stretch has a slope of 50 cm/km and runs through the cities Itumbiara (km 392) and Anhanguera (km 535), both in the territory of Goias, and through the city of Arapor√£ (km 392) in the mine region. In this segment the Itumbiara Dam, situated in the municipality of gemeente Arapor√£, belonging to the Furnas Centrais El√©tricas, operating since 1981 with a power of 2.800MW, being the most power generating hydro-station of the Furnas complex, of the state Minas Gerais and of the Paranaiba river. The river presents a relatively wide bed, cultivated for 20% to 50% of the area and at km 400 starts to run on the well known extensive basalt plate of the Paran√° River. =The low Parana√≠ba= From the reservoir of the waterfall Dourada up to the unison with the Grande river, with 330 km length. Between km 199 and 330 there is a slope of 33 cm/km. At the limit of this stretch, using the readily available energy, a hydroelectric power station \\"of the waterfall Dourado\\" was built. This station used to belong to Centrais El√©tricas de Goias (CELG), was privatised and now belongs to \\"Empresa Endesa Cachoeira\\" with a generator of 658,000 kW and a waterfall of 19 m providing energy to CELG. Her reservoir takes up about 78 km of the middle Parana√≠ba. On the stretch from here to km 195 we find the so-called canal of S√£o Sim√£o (Simon), a narrow canal cut out of the basalt, 23 km long and 35 m deep situated on the border of Minas en Goias. In this stretch we find the S√£o Sim√£o Dam, operating with a power of 2.680MW At 3 km higher up from the bridge in Highway BR-31 the Parana√≠ba, now 3,500 m wide, rushes into a canal 300 m wide that further downstream is narrowed to scarcely 80 m, creating a high turbulence and speed. The river is navigable from the dam of the island Solteira over a length of 180 km up to the dam of S√£o Sim√£o. As with the Grande river, there are problems increasing the navigability, such as high falls, rapids etc. In any case it would be very interesting to have navigability into the central region of Brazil, including into the federal capital Brazilia. History =S√£o Sim√£o Channel= One of the greatest ecological losses in Brazil was the disappearance of the S√¢o Sim√£o Channel (Canal de S√£o Sim√£o) located on the lower stretch of the river. It was a narrow gorge cut into the basalt, with 23 kilometers length and 35 meters depth, situated on the boundary of the states of Minas and Goi√°s. The waters of the river, after dividing into two parallel arms, returned to a common bed, forming a corridor of waterfalls. Today this spectacle no longer exists. The building of the S√£o Sim√£o Dam, with the need to increase the capacity of power of the hydroelectric power station, has created a huge lake whose waters have covered the channel.

This tanager is a resident breeder in South America from eastern Colombia and Venezuela south to Paraguay and central Brazil, Per√∫ and on Trinidad. It is common and conspicuous. Ramphocelus carbo Silver-beaked tanagers are long and weigh . Adult males are velvety crimson black with a deep crimson throat and breast. The upper mandible of the bill is black, but the enlarged lower mandible is bright silver in appearance. The bill is pointed upwards in display. The female is much duller, with brownish upperparts, reddish brown underparts and a black bill. There is considerable plumage variation between the various subspecies, differing mainly in the degree of contrast between the upperparts and the throat and breast. It occurs in light woodland and cultivated areas. The bulky cup nest is usually built in a bush, and the normal clutch is two green-blue eggs blotched with black- brown. The female incubates the eggs for 11‚Äì13 days before they hatch. The chicks fledge after another 11‚Äì12 days. Individuals may live at least 11 years in the wild. These are social birds which eat mainly fruit, but insects are also taken. The silver-beaked tanager is often seen in groups of six to ten, frequently giving a call described as cheeng.

Plot The plot is set in the 1960s, which chronicles the awakening of the hippie stoner Divine Right (alter ego of the main character D.R. Davenport) as he travels from Kentucky with his girlfriend Estelle across the country, in a patient and introspective 1963 VW Bus, Urge. Divine Right has no idea where he is or where he is going. D.R. and Estelle take turns sleeping and driving, but D.R.'s constant straddling between waking and sleeping makes the journey as much an inner trip as it is a physical seemingly random trip from Urge to anywhere. The first helper character to be encountered is the Lone Outdoorsman who is a non-moving object in this road-trip story, stuck camping on the same site since years ago, watching TV in his solitude. He is a suspicious soul. The next helper is the Greek, who is named for his talking. The Greek is on a journey back to Norman, Oklahoma, to destroy the last remaining record of himself, which is an autobiographical Master's thesis. He wants to erase himself and forget his name, and hopes to come closer to Nirvana by doing this. It seems D.R. and the Greek have a lot in common in this quest, but while the Greek is moving toward some goal, D.R. is only running away from home. Next up is the Native, whom D.R. meets while attending a funeral for his friend Eddie. After this D.R. heads for his sister and tells Estelle he would prefer to see his sister's family without her. He is reluctant to mix his two identities; with Estelle he is D.R. and with his sister he is David Ray. This results in Estelle leaving D.R., and the story, for good. D.R. settles in at his sister Marcella and Doyle's house as if he were born there, and he finds out about a person called Emmit, his chance for salvation. While Marcella's family is at church, D.R. gets his own message from what he perceives as God (Mrs. Godsey) over the phone. She tells him to come home and take care of Emmit. As D.R. crosses the Ohio River, the narration suddenly shifts from Divine Right's journey home to David Ray's weekend trips as a boy from Cincinnati back to the old homeplace. When we change back to Divine Right he is at a crossroads in Kentucky and so is the story: the two D.R.'s are about to converge. D.R. struggles with his two selves as he gets closer to home. He hallucinates in the back of the van, meets a dragon with \\"seven horns\\". He perceives himself as the \\"monster\\". Even so, when he gets to Mrs. Godsey's, he exits the van as David Ray and the two identities finally converged into one after a face off in a nearby coal mine. D.R. psychically returns home, helping his dead grandmother with the laundry and sharing tea with his Uncle Emmit. D.R. becomes a part of his Uncle Emmit, a part of his family, and a part of the hillside where he will live and where his Uncle Emmit will be buried. Emmit is planted in the ground \\"like a seed,\\" and D.R. sleeps in Emmit's bed. Emmit is in the box marked \\"past,\\" and D.R. is in the one marked \\"present.\\" Everything seems to be in harmony, except for the fact that Estelle is missing. She returns and D.R. marries her, and the story is completed. Divine Right has found himself travelling back to his Appalachian roots. Background Divine Right's Trip was originally printed in installments in Whole Earth Catalog in 1971. Norman also wrote the short story collection Kinfolks: The Wilgus Stories in 1977. Both the novel and the short stories share an Appalachian background.

The number \\"256\\" in Ashoka's Minor Rock Edict No.1 in Sasaram (circa 250 BCE). Coin of Western Satrap Damasena (232 CE). The minting date, here 153 (100-50-3 in Brahmi script numerals) of the Saka era, therefore 232 CE, clearly appears behind the head of the king. The Brahmi numerals are a numeral system attested from the 3rd century BCE (somewhat later in the case of most of the tens). They are the direct graphic ancestors of the modern Indian and Hindu‚ÄìArabic numerals. However, they were conceptually distinct from these later systems, as they were not used as a positional system with a zero. Rather, there were separate numerals for each of the tens (10, 20, 30, etc.). There were also symbols for 100 and 1000 which were combined in ligatures with the units to signify 200, 300, 2000, 3000, etc.  Origins  The source of the first three numerals seems clear: they are collections of 1, 2, and 3 strokes, in Ashoka's era vertical I, II, III like Roman numerals, but soon becoming horizontal like the ancient Han Chinese numerals. In the oldest inscriptions, 4 is a +, reminiscent of the X of neighboring , and perhaps a representation of 4 lines or 4 directions. However, the other unit numerals appear to be arbitrary symbols in even the oldest inscriptions. It is sometimes supposed that they may also have come from collections of strokes, run together in cursive writing in a way similar to that attested in the development of Egyptian hieratic and demotic numerals, but this is not supported by any direct evidence. Likewise, the units for the tens are not obviously related to each other or to the units, although 10, 20, 80, 90 might be based on a circle. Brahmi numerals signs of the 2nd century CE. The sometimes rather striking graphic similarity they have with the hieratic and demotic Egyptian numerals, while suggestive, is not prima facie evidence of an historical connection, as many cultures have independently recorded numbers as collections of strokes. With a similar writing instrument, the cursive forms of such groups of strokes could easily be broadly similar as well, and this is one of the primary hypotheses for the origin of Brahmi numerals. Another possibility is that the numerals were acrophonic, like the Attic numerals, and based on the alphabet. For instance, chatur 4 early on took a ¬• shape much like the Kharosthi letter ch; panca 5 looks remarkably like Kharosthi p; and so on through shat 6, sapta 7, and nava 9 (Kharosthi sh, s, n). However, there are problems of timing and lack of records. The full set of numerals is not attested until the 1st-2nd century CE, 400 years after Ashoka. Assertions that either the numerals derive from tallies or that they are alphabetic are, at best, educated guesses.

It was last served by Amtrak's daily Empire Builder (with service from Chicago, Illinois to Seattle, Washington or Portland, Oregon) and, for a time, by the North Star (with service from Chicago, and later from this station, to Duluth, Minnesota), as well as briefly by the North Coast Hiawatha (with service from Chicago to Seattle). It was built to a design developed under the Amtrak Standard Stations Program. The Midway station was closed for passenger service on May 7, 2014, with passenger service being moved to the restored Saint Paul Union Depot. For a time after its closure the station was still used to service the Empire Builder but was later abandoned. Description Inside the Midway station, before it was closed to passenger service The Midway station is located at 730 Transfer Road and is named after the Midway area of Saint Paul. Its Amtrak station code was MSP and from 1978 to 2014 it served as the only intercity train station for the Minneapolis-Saint Paul metropolitan area. The station can be easily accessed from I‚Äë94/US‚Äë12/US‚Äë52. The station has an elevation of . Prior to closing for passenger service, the station offered an indoor waiting area, ticketing service and a Quik-Trak kiosk, restrooms, payphones, baggage assistance, and checked baggage. Free long and short parking was also available. Station hours were from 6:00 am to 11:45 pm daily. The station is located next to tracks owned by the Minnesota Commercial Railway and marks a division point between running on the Canadian Pacific Railway (former Milwaukee Road tracks between Chicago and St. Paul) and the BNSF Railway (former Great Northern Railway tracks between Minneapolis and Seattle.) There are two platforms at the station, though the Empire Builder only used the side platform nearest the station building. There is a second island platform that serves two tracks, but it was rarely used. There are also two spurs behind the main platform which are used for storage and display of historic train cars. Of the six Minnesota stations served by Amtrak, Midway was the busiest for the Fiscal Year 2013 (its last full year of service), boarding or detraining an average of approximately 321 passengers daily (more than twice the ridership all other Minnesota stations combined). History Midway station construction, October 1977 When it opened on March 1, 1978, Midway station replaced Minneapolis Great Northern Depot as the sole intercity station in the Twin Cities. Amtrak had opted to consolidate all of its Twin Cities services in Minneapolis when it began operation in 1971, shuttering the Saint Paul Union Depot. The Great Northern Depot was later demolished. The Empire Builder at the Midway station, August 2011 The primary rail service at this station for most of its existence was the Empire Builder, named to honor Saint Paul- based mogul James J. Hill who constructed the Great Northern Railway, and whose nickname was \\"The Empire Builder\\". Westbound trains head for Spokane, Washington (and then split before continuing on to either Seattle, Washington or Portland, Oregon) while eastbound trains head for Chicago. There were several intermittent stops between. The next westbound stop for the Empire Builder was in St. Cloud and the next eastbound stop was in Red Wing, both in Minnesota. About one-eighth of Empire Builder passengers boarded or arrived at this station. After opening in 1978, the station briefly served the North Coast Hiawatha until that service ended in 1979. The North Coast Hiawatha ran three times per week from Chicago to Seattle with the next westbound stop having also been in St. Cloud and the next eastbound stop having also been in Red Wing. The station was also served by the North Star with services to Chicago and Duluth, with the stop having been in Cambridge, Minnesota and the next southbound stop having been in Red Wing until serviced was truncated from Chicago to this station in 1981. After the North Star was discontinued in 1985, Amtrak has continued service to Duluth with its Thruway Motorcoach service. On May 7, 2014, Amtrak moved its Twin Cities-area stop to the renovated and reopened Saint Paul Union Depot. After a short time of Midway station being closed to the public, but still serving as a service stop for the Empire Builder, the building was abandoned, ending up on St. Paul's vacant property listings.

In the international context, it was part of the European wars of religion. The Count's Feud takes its name from the Protestant Count Christopher of Oldenburg, who supported the Catholic King Christian II, deposed in 1523, over the election of Christian III,.. a staunch Protestant who had already implemented Lutheranism as the state religion in Schleswig and Holstein in 1528.  Background  King Christian III After Frederick I's death in 1533, the Jutland nobility proclaimed his son, then Duke Christian of Gottorp, as king under the name Christian III. Meanwhile, Count Christopher (or Christoffer) organized an uprising against the new king, demanding that Christian II be set free. Supported by L√ºbeck and troops from Oldenburg and Mecklenburg, parts of the Zealand and Sk√•ne nobilities rose up, together with cities such as Copenhagen and Malm√∏. The violence itself began in 1534, when a privateer captain who had earlier been in Christian II's service, Klemen Andersen, called Skipper Clement, at Count Christoffer's request instigated the peasants of Vendsyssel and North Jutland to rise up against the nobles. The headquarters for the revolt came to be in Aalborg. A large number of manors were burned down in northern and western Jutland. On 10 August 1534, Count Christoffer accepted Sk√•ne for Christian II's rule. The month before, Christoffer was heralded as regent on Christian II's behalf by the Zealand Council in Ringsted.. The battles of Svenstrup and Aalborg Johan Rantzau An army of nobles under the leadership of Niels Brock and Holger Rosenkrantz was defeated at the Battle of Svenstrup on 16 October 1534. Christian III, in the meantime, forced a peace with L√ºbeck, from which great reinforcements could be freed up to fight against the rebels. Under the leadership of Johan Rantzau, the royal troops pursued the peasants all the way to Aalborg, where the latter, under the leadership of Skipper Clement, had taken refuge behind the city's fortifications. On 18 December, Rantzau's troops stormed the city, and it fell. At least 2,000 people are thought to have lost their lives in the storming of the city and in the plundering of the following days. For his part, Skipper Clement, badly wounded, managed to escape, but a few days later was recognized by a peasant in Storvorde east of Aalborg and handed over to Rantzau. Skipper Clement was later sentenced to death by the judicial council in Viborg and executed in 1536.Grevens Fejde, borgerkrig 1534-1536 (Gr√¶nseforeningen) The battles of Helsingborg and √òksnebjerg Fortune did not fare well for the rebelling supporters of the Catholic faith, nor for the farmers on the Swedish front. The Swedish King Gustav Vasa sent a Swedish army to the aid of Christian III, which invaded Sk√•ne at Loshult and plundered, burned, and murdered their way throughout the area as it advanced toward the town of V√¶. Later, a Swedish army invaded Halland, which was destroyed by fire and sword. Some of the Scanian nobles sided with the Swedes, but Tyge Krabbe in Helsingborg Castle supported Count Christoffer. In January 1535, the Swedes and the army of nobles advanced on Helsingborg. An army consisting of residents of L√ºbeck and Malm√∏ under J√∏rgen Kock was entrenched outside of the castle, and in a decisive moment, Tyge Krabbe suddenly had the castle's cannons open fire against its defenders, after which he opened the castle to the Swedes, who set fire to Helsingborg and reduced the town to ashes. With that, Denmark east of the Sound was lost for Count Christoffer. After the victory at Aalborg, Rantzau brought his troops to Funen, and on 11 June 1535, they fought the Battle of √òksnebjerg, where the rest of Count Christoffer's army was decisively defeated. Both Copenhagen and Malm√∏, however, were able to hold out until 1536, when they were forced to capitulate after several months' siege. With this, the Count's Feud was officially over. The aftermath In the aftermath of the feud, the nobles regrouped and healed the rifts the usual way, namely through inter-marriage. One of the most powerful among the Danish nobility in Sk√•ne at this time was the Bille family, who were tied through blood relations to seven of the eight Catholic bishops of Denmark. The Billes also had six family members on the Council of the Realm and owned castles throughout Denmark and Norway. In order to keep the family's powerful position, in spite of the religious affiliation with the Catholic faith, Claus Bille (of Stockholm Bloodbath fame, second cousin to Gustav Vasa), protected the family by forming a political alliance through marriage with the Brahe family, another powerful Scanian family among the Danish nobility at this time. The Brahe family was one of the first among the nobility to convert to Lutheranism. Claus Bille gave his 18-year-old daughter Beate in marriage to Otte Brahe, and thus became a grandfather in 1546 to the perhaps most famous Scanian of the era, the astronomer Tyge Brahe, better known as Tycho Brahe. Tycho Brahe's paternal grandfather, whom he was named after, Tyge Brahe of Tosterup in eastern Sk√•ne, was killed 7 September 1523 during the siege of Malm√∏, fighting for Frederick I. Axel Brahe, the brother of the older Tyge Brahe, served as governor of Scania for a long period, and was one of the first to convert to Lutheranism. In contrast, the consequences of the peasant uprising cost all parties dearly. Many were forced to purchase their lives with great gifts both to the king and to the nobles. Moreover, the dissatisfactions of the peasants, which had culminated in the uprising of the Count's Feud, were only made worse, as the nobility began to stick together even more after this incident. Moreover, Christian III's rule, ushered in by this war, saw the rise of royal absolutism in Denmark, and, with it, greater repression of the peasant classes. An important consequence not sufficiently appreciated by Danes at the time was the introduction of a Swedish army into Sk√•ne. Though in this case the Swedes came at the invitation of a Danish king to help subdue his rebellious subjects and duly handed over to the king the territory which they conquered, it had a clear effect of whetting Swedish appetite to gain the territory for themselves, which was manifested in a long series of subsequent wars culminating with the final Swedish victory and conquest in 1658.

It has also been referred to as the \\"Figaro/Don Giovanni Fantasy\\"Howard 2003. and is based on music from Mozart's operas The Marriage of Figaro (1786) and Don Giovanni (1787). Liszt composed the work by the end of 1842 or early 1843, as he performed it at the latest in Berlin on 11 January 1843. Ferruccio Busoni published a much shorter performing version, the Fantasy on Two Motives from W. A. Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro, in 1912.Original German title: \\"Fantasie √ºber zwei Motive aus W. A. Mozarts Die Hochzeit des Figaro\\". \\"Fantasie\\" is sometimes translated as \\"Fantasia\\", and \\"Motive\\" is sometimes translated as \\"Themes\\". For example, see the title used for Hyperion's recording played by Stephen Hough. Kindermann 1980, p. 440, gives the German title: Fantasie f√ºr Pianoforte √ºber zwei Motive aus Wolfgang Amadeus Mozarts Oper ¬ªDie Hochzeit des Figaro¬´. Roberge 1991, p. 56, gives the English title \\"Fantasy on Two Motives from 'Le Nozze di Figaro' by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart for Piano\\". Busoni's version, which does not include the music based on Don Giovanni, is often nicknamed the \\"Figaro Fantasy\\". Liszt's incomplete manuscript contains no title, no tempo indications, and very few dynamics and articulation marks. The ending is some few bars from complete. Liszt probably tried out an improvised solution in performance, judging by the rather insignificant gaps.Howard 1997, pp. III-IV. Poster for The Marriage of Figaro. Manuscript The Liszt autograph manuscript for the nearly completed work is housed at the Stiftung Weimarer Klassik/Goethe- und Schiller-Archiv, Weimar (shelf mark GSA 60/I 45). There is no title, date or place of composition, or signature. It consists of 50 unnumbered pages of music. Much of the music is based on two arias from the opera The Marriage of Figaro: Figaro's \\"Non pi√π andrai\\" (Act I) and Cherubino's \\"Voi che sapete\\" (Act II). Fifteen pages are devoted to the dance scene from the Act I finale of Don Giovanni.Sitsky 2009, pp. 237-238. Short version by Busoni Title page of Busoni's version At some point the pianist-composer Ferruccio Busoni, who has been described as \\"probably the most open and enthusiastic Liszt exponent in the early twentieth century,\\"James Deaville, \\"Liszt in the twentieth century\\" in Hamilton 2005, p. 36. became aware of the unpublished manuscript and prepared a performing version which he first played in 1911 in Berlin.Dent 1933, p. 328. Busoni gave a series of six all-Liszt recitals in mid-October of that year, playing nearly all of the major piano works, and these are the concerts at which his version, the \\"Figaro Fantasy\\", most likely received its first performance. (Busoni had been on tour in the United States for the first three months of the year, and these were his first piano recitals after returning to Europe in April.)Beaumont 1987, p. 134.Couling 2005, p. 242. Later, in the summer of 1912, after the unsuccessful premiere of his Wagnerian-length opera Die Brautwahl in mid-April and a concert tour through Italy in May, Busoni decided to stay home alone in Berlin to work, while his wife Gerda was in Switzerland on holiday. It was during this period of time that he prepared his version of Liszt's \\"Fantasy\\" for publication. The manuscript (No. 245 in the Busoni Archive) is dated 11 July 1912. It was published that same year by Breitkopf & H√§rtel as Fantasie √ºber zwei Motive aus W. A. Mozarts Die Hochzeit des Figaro [Fantasy on two motives from W. A. Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro] (BV B 66).Busoni 1912; Kindermann 1980, p. 440. As the title suggests, Busoni did not include the music from Don Giovanni, shortening the currently known manuscript of more than 597 bars by 245 bars. The changes also included Busoni's 16-bar completion, as well as 10 additional bars on p. 28, and other elaborations of 5, 1 and 4 bars duration, including expression marks, cadenzas, and ossias. Unfortunately, no editorial notes were included, so there was little or no indication of his alterationsOne ossia on p. 20 is marked with the initials \\"F.L.\\" and a second, with \\"F.B.\\" (Busoni 1912, p. 20). or pages omitted. That summer Busoni also arranged and composed music for the edizione minore of the Fantasia contrappuntistica, the Sonatina Seconda for piano, and incidental music for Frank Wedekind's play Franziska, consisting of sketches for twelve numbers which he never finished. He also shortened and modified the music of Die Brautwahl for a new production and extensively rearranged the music into a suite for concert performance. There is no mention of, nor was there much time available for a trip to Weimar to re-examine Liszt's manuscript, and it is now clear that his version was never intended to be a scholarly edition of Liszt's piece.Beaumont 1985, p. 369.Couling 2005, p. 254. Kenneth Hamilton, in his review of Howard's later edition, notes that \\"for reasons of personal psychology that we can only guess at, [Busoni] chose to give the impression in his preface that he had expanded, rather than drastically cut, Liszt's manuscript.\\"Hamilton 1998, p. 316. By contrast, the Busoni scholar Larry Sitsky maintains that it is not certain that Liszt intended to perform the music from the two operas together. Instead, since the manuscript pages are unnumbered, it is possible that pages from two separate works were at some point in time placed together in the Weimar holdings. \\"Since the transition to and from the Don Giovanni music is in C major, the 15 pages of manuscript can be played or omitted without any damage to the harmonic scheme. The Don Giovanni paraphrase begins on a fresh page and at no time are motives from both operas seen on the same page of Liszt's manuscript.\\"Sitsky 2009, p. 238. Long version by Howard It was not until much later in the twentieth century that anyone compared Busoni's version to the manuscript. In 1991 the Scottish pianist and writer Kenneth Hamilton was the first to publish the results of such a comparison.Hamilton 1991. Later, after learning of Hamilton's findings, the Australian-born pianist, and noted performer of Liszt's music, Leslie Howard, attempted to reconstruct the work as he believed Liszt intended, recording, and in 1997 publishing, the newly-recast work. His intention was to \\"publish... the whole of Liszt's Fantasy with an authenticity of text, supplying and clearly indicating the few bars... which are necessary to render the work performable.\\"Howard 1997, p. IV. Francisco d'Andrade as Don Giovanni. As reconstructed by Howard, the piece includes the music based on the dance scene from the Act I finale of Don Giovanni. The dramatic opening is based on the music from Figaro: a free paraphrase of \\"Non pi√π andrai\\" followed by an arrangement of \\"Voi che sapete\\" in A-flat major instead of Mozart's B-flat major. This is the only appearance of Cherubino's music. Figaro's aria returns, initially in its original C major, but is quickly varied both harmonically and pianistically. However, instead of proceeding to Mozart's coda, the aria transitions to the dances from Don Giovanni. In the opera, the dances are a minuet in , a country dance in , and a quick waltz in . Liszt keeps the minuet in F major, and combines it with the country dance in the same key. He does not add the waltz as Mozart does, but treats it separately, eventually combining it with the country dance and, \\"excellently,\\" a portion of Figaro's aria. A series of modulations follow which combine bits of all four themes. At the final transition, the earlier material from Figaro is reused alongside the theme from the minuet. This leads to the coda, which finishes Figaro's aria and where the manuscript breaks off just before the likely end of the piece. Howard has added a transitional passage of three bars from the Don Giovanni dance music to the final sectionHoward 1997, pp. 36‚Äì37. and the final 15 bars to complete the piece.Howard 1997, p. 39. He has also added expression marks, including \\"dynamics, marks of articulation, numbers indicating numerical groupings, m.d. and m.s. marks, pedallings, tempo and other textual directions. The evident deficiencies of the manuscript (time signatures, accidentals, stems, beams, rest signs, fermatas) have been tacitly supplied throughout.\\"Howard 1997, p. IV. For explanations of musical terminology, see Glossary of musical terminology and List of musical symbols. He uses square brackets to differentiate his additions or suggestions from the original text. The dedication to Monsieur de Gericke Conseille de Legation appears in the left margin on p. 38 in Howard's reconstruction of the work. The selection and juxtaposition of themes from Figaro and Don Giovanni may have had special significance for Liszt. Leslie Howard describes it as follows: > Bearing in mind George Bernard Shaw's perceptive observations upon Liszt's > musical interpretation of the morality of the Don in the Don Giovanni > Fantasy, it might be similarly if cautiously suggested that the combination > and disposition of the themes in the minuet scene in the present work also > adumbrate a moral fable: that the flirtatiousness of Cherubino which may > seem harmless enough at the beginning could be leading to the unforgivable > behaviour of a Don Giovanni, unless good common sense (See Figaro: \\"Non pi√π > andrai...\\") hinders him from doing so.Howard 1997, p. III. Performance The Figaro Fantasy, as prepared by Busoni, was performed extensively by himself, his student Egon Petri, and later championed by the youthful Vladimir Horowitz and Grigory Ginsburg. The Russian pianist Emil Gilels made a famous recording of Busoni's version in 1935. However, it has fallen out of the standard pianist repertoire. Stephen Hough and Jean-Yves Thibaudet still perform this work occasionally and have both recorded it.Stephen Hough. A Mozart Album (recorded in 2006). . Jean-Yves Thibaudet.

They lie north of Buru and Ceram. They cover a land area of 2,823.43 km2, and had a population of 41,455 at the 2010 Census,Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011. which had risen to about 46,080 by 2018.Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2020. Geography Obi Island, or also called Obira Island, is the largest island in the Obi Islands archipelago. Obi Island is surrounded by many small islands, including Obilatu Island, Bisa Island, Gata- gata Island, Latu Island, Woka Island, and Tomini Island. Obi Island is bordered by the Maluku Sea to the west, the Seram Sea to the south, and the Obi Strait to the north and east. The major islands closest to Obi Island are Bacan Island to the north and Ambon to the south. The topography of Obi Island is generally in the form of hills with a short coastline. The hilly surface conditions result in many springs and rivers. Lake Kapi, in the west, is the largest lake on Obi Island. Administration Obi Island is part of South Halmahera Regency. It is directly bordered by Maluku Province in the south and West Papua Province in the east. The total area of the island is about . Obi Island and the surrounding small islands are divided into five administrative districts (kecamatan), and each district is divided into 34 administrative villages (desa and kelurahan), with villages further subdivided into hamlets. Demographics The population of the Obi Islands Group is approximately 46,000 people (in 2018)Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2020., with a population density of 16.3 people per square kilometer, per Indonesian Department of Population and Civil Registry data for South Halmahera in 2010. All inhabitants on the Obi Island are migrants, as these islands had no indigenous population. The first groups to settle on Obi Island were the Buton, followed by immigrants from Tobelo-Galela, Ternate, Tidore, Makian- Kayoa, Bugis, Makassar and Java. Almost all of the residents are scattered along the coast with the highlands mostly uninhabited jungle. However, there are some worker settlements in hilly areas which have mines and temporary settlements for clove farmers used during clove harvesting season. Infrastructure, especially in terms of modern medical facilities, is lacking. The languages spoken on the islands are Galela and Tobelo, which belong to the West Papuan language family. Economy The dominant plantation products in the Obi Islands are cloves, nutmeg, coconut and pepper. The main economic potential of the islands s in the mining sector. The island has resources of gold, coal, nickel, cement, and petroleum. In 2016, provincial governor Abdul Ghani Kasuba successfully negotiated for the China-based Jinchun Group to build a nine-trillion rupiah nickel smelter on the main island.China\`s Jinchun to in vest Rp9 trillion in North Maluku.

Other chronologies place his reign in 738‚Äì754, but cannot be reconciled with the testimony of the \\"Namelist\\". According to historians such as Steven Runciman and David Marshall Lang, Sevar is the last ruler of the Dulo dynasty, and with him died out the lineage of Attila the Hun. It has been suggested that his name is derived from Persian Ziwar (adornment). Although initially a female name, it could also serve as a component of male names, as suggested by Chuvash pre-Christian name Aksƒïver.

It is by far the largest island in Lake Baikal in eastern Siberia, with an area of . Structurally, it constitutes the southwestern margin of the Academician Ridge. The island measures in length and in width. There are two versions regarding the origin of the name of the island and both are derived from the language of the Buryats, the indigenous people of Olkhon. The first is that the island's name comes from the word oyhon ‚Äì ‚Äúwoody‚Äù, and the second is that it comes from olhan ‚Äì ‚Äúdry‚Äù. It is still debated which of the two is the actual origin of the name Olkhon as both words describe the island perfectly. Much of the island is still covered by forests and the amount of precipitation is extremely low ‚Äì about per year. Geography Olkhon has a dramatic combination of terrain and is rich in archaeological landmarks. Steep mountains line its eastern shore, and at above sea level, Mount Zhima is the highest point on the island, peaking at above the water level of Lake Baikal. The island is large enough to have its own lakes, and features a combination of taiga, steppe and even a small desert. A deep strait separates the island from the land. The island's appearance is a result of millions of years of tectonic movement resulting in the hollowing of the channel between the land (Maloe More Sound and Olkhon Gate Strait) and the block of stone forming the island. The steep slopes of the mountains show the vertical heave of the earth. View over the Maloje More Strait from the island Population The population of the island is less than 1,744 and consists mostly of Buryats, the island's aboriginal people.Greenpeace Russia There are several settlements and five villages on the island: Yalga, Malomorets, Khuzhir, Kharantsy, and Ulan-Khushin. The village of Khuzhir is the administrative capital of Olkhon, designated as such in April 1987 when the Soviet government issued a comprehensive decree protecting Lake Baikal. Khuzhir is home to about 1,200 residents and boasts a museum of local nature and history. Economy Most residents are fishermen, farmers, or cattle- ranchers. Due to an increasing number of tourists from all over the world, many residents work in this sector as well, and tourism has become an important part of the economy in Olkhon. Culture serges at Shamanka on Olkhon Island The indigenous Buryats, adherents of shamanism, believe the island to be a spiritual place; one of the groups of deities revered in Buryati yellow shamanism is called the oikony noyod, the \\"thirteen lords of Olkhon\\". On the western coast, close to Khuzhir, is Baikal's most famous landmark, the Shamanka, or Shaman's Rock. Natives believe that Burkhan, a modern religious cult figure of the Altai peoples, lives in the cave in this rock. The rock is one of nine most sacred places in Asia. Olkhon is considered a centre of Kurumchinskay culture of the 6th‚Äì10th centuries. The museum at Olkhon, named after Revyakin, has exhibits on the nature and ethnography of the island, including pipe-smoking and a samovar collection. History The island has a long history of human habitation. The original indigenous , the Buryats and the Yakuts. Russian explorers first visited during the 17th century. Places of interest Khuzhir is the main village on Olkhon Island and contains , shops and homestays. Coast of Olkhon Island Kuzhir The National History Museum of Revyakin N. M in Khuzhir contains collections of historical items linked to the life and culture of the people of Olkhon from Neolithic times to the present day. Here, visitors can see various items such as stone arrowheads, badges of Mongolian soldiers, and materials used in cremation rituals, and can learn about life on this island of political exiles in the Soviet era, as well as the unique flora and fauna that can only be found on Olkhon Island. The Revyakin Museum was originally named after a famous geologist, paleontologist, geographer and writer of science fiction, Obruchev. However, it was later named after its founder, and a teacher of geography, N. M. Revyakin. Semi-desert landscape on Olkhon Island Peschanaya Village is an abandoned settlement famous for its picturesque sand dunes and the unique appearance of the trees found here ‚Äì stilted trees with their roots exposed above the sand. The constant winds that blow from the sea towards land move the sand away from the shore and form high sand hills, which are called \\"moving sands\\", as these sand dunes constantly change location depending on the direction of the wind. This strong wind has also resulted in the exposure of roots of trees near the shore, giving the trees the appearance of a standing person, thus earning them the name \\"walking trees\\". Furthermore, there used to be a gulag fish factory here where prisoners worked during Soviet times. However, after Stalin's death, these prisoners were released, and the factory has been abandoned since the 1950s. Three Brothers Rock, or Sagaan-Khushun Cape, is one of Baikal's natural monuments and another popular tourist sightseeing spot. It is easily recognised as three big rocks standing in a row overlooking Lake Baikal. According to an old Buryatian legend, there once lived three brothers on Olkhon Island whose father had supernatural powers. Once, their father turned them into eagles but only on the condition that they would not eat dead meat. The brothers were extremely happy with their newly gained freedom as eagles and decided to fly around the island after promising not to eat dead meat. However, when they were flying around the island, they became hungry and found a dead animal. Despite their promises to their father, they ate this dead animal. When their father learned about it, he was furious and turned them into the three rocks that we see today. Khoboy Cape is the most northern point of Olkhon island. The name comes from an old Buryat word meaning \\"fang\\" because of its shape, a vertically oriented marble rock, appearing much like a fang. The Cape of Khargoy is famous for its remains of an ancient Kurykan's stone wall. The wall is probably one of the best preserved ancient structures of the island and is composed of large stones without the use of any binding materials. The wall is about in length, and in some parts, its height can be as tall as . The Kurykan Wall at Cape Khorgoy was first discovered and described in 1879 by geologist Jan Czerski. Ecological concerns Piece of woodland after deforestation One of the most important ecological problems of Olkhon Island is the disposal of household waste. At present, the waste is disposed of in large piles in woods near the village of Khuzhir. The dump is unenclosed, and the tipping process is uncontrolled. Moreover, with recent increases in tourism on the island, new sources of hard rubbish have begun to appear. Another ecological concern affecting the island is the illegal felling of timber by local inhabitants. A complicated net of forestry roads in the areas adjacent to Khuzhir leads to woodland areas on the mountain slopes. Timber is brought out of the forest at night time, and the deforestation is taking its toll on the area.

A common source used is the hydrogen isotope tritium. Unlike most nuclear power sources which use nuclear radiation to generate heat which then is used to generate electricity, betavoltaic devices use a non-thermal conversion process, converting the electron-hole pairs produced by the ionization trail of beta particles traversing a semiconductor.A 25-Year Battery: Long-lived nuclear batteries powered by hydrogen isotopes are in testing for military applications, Katherine Bourzac, Technology Review, MIT, 17 Nov 2009. Betavoltaic power sources (and the related technology of alphavoltaic power sourcesNASA Glenn Research Center, Alpha- and Beta-voltaics (accessed Oct. 4, 2011)) are particularly well-suited to low-power electrical applications where long life of the energy source is needed, such as implantable medical devices or military and space applications.  History  Betavoltaics were invented in the 1970s. Some pacemakers in the 1970s used betavoltaics based on promethium, but were phased out as cheaper lithium batteries were developed. Early semiconducting materials weren't efficient at converting electrons from beta decay into usable current, so higher energy, more expensive‚Äîand potentially hazardous‚Äîisotopes were used. The more efficient semiconducting materials used today can be paired with relatively benign isotopes such as tritium, which produce less radiation. The Betacel was considered the first successfully commercialized betavoltaic battery.  Proposals  The primary use for betavoltaics is for remote and long-term use, such as spacecraft requiring electrical power for a decade or two. Recent progress has prompted some to suggest using betavoltaics to trickle-charge conventional batteries in consumer devices, such as cell phones and laptop computers. As early as 1973, betavoltaics were suggested for use in long-term medical devices such as pacemakers. In 2016 it was proposed that carbon-14 in a diamond crystal structure could be used as a longer lived betavoltaic device (a diamond battery). The carbon-14 could be sourced from graphite blocks from decommissioned graphite-moderated reactors. The blocks are otherwise handled as nuclear waste with a half life of 5,700 years. By extracting carbon-14 from the graphite blocks and turning it into a diamond crystal structure, the radioactive carbon isotope can be used as a power source while allowing the remaining non-radioactive graphite to be re-used for other applications such as pencils or electric motor brushes. Although the specific activity of carbon-14 is low and therefore the power density of a nuclear diamond battery is small, they can be used for low power sensor networks and structural health monitoring. In 2018 a Russian design based on 2-micron thick nickel-63 slabs sandwiched between 10 micron diamond layers was introduced. It produced a power output of about 1 ŒºW at a power density of 10 ŒºW/cm3. Its energy density was 3.3 kWh/kg. The half-life of nickel-63 is 100 years.  Drawbacks  As radioactive material emits, it slowly decreases in activity (refer to half- life). Thus, over time a betavoltaic device will provide less power. For practical devices, this decrease occurs over a period of many years. For tritium devices, the half-life is 12.32 years. In device design, one must account for what battery characteristics are required at end-of-life, and ensure that the beginning-of-life properties take into account the desired usable lifetime. Liability connected with environmental laws and human exposure to tritium and its beta decay must also be taken into consideration in risk assessment and product development. Naturally, this increases both time-to-market and the already high cost associated with tritium. A 2007 report by the UK government's Health Protection Agency Advisory Group on Ionizing Radiation declared the health risks of tritium exposure to be double those previously set by the International Commission on Radiological Protection located in Sweden.  Availability  Betavoltaic nuclear batteries can be purchased commercially. Available devices include a 100 ŒºW tritium- powered device weighing 20 grams.  Safety  Although betavoltaics use a radioactive material as a power source, the beta particles used are low energy and easily stopped by a few millimetres of shielding. With proper device construction (that is, proper shielding and containment), a betavoltaic device would not emit dangerous radiation. Leakage of the enclosed material would engender health risks, just as leakage of the materials in other types of batteries (such as lithium, cadmium and lead) leads to significant health and environmental concerns.

A planned extension that year from Oak Square to Nonantum Square was not built, though a line from Watertown to Nonantum Square was. In the late 1880s, the West End Street Railway consolidated the horse railroads, including the Cambridge Railroad, under its control. The West End opened its first electric streetcar line on January 3, 1889. The line ran between the Allston Carhouse (just north of Union Square) and Park Square via Harvard Street, Beacon Street, Massachusetts Avenue, and Boylston Street. Electric service was extended to Oak Square on January 13. Electric service between Watertown and Mount Auburn began on December 12, 1893; the line was double-tracked later in the decade. On August 18, 1896, the Western Avenue line was double-tracked and electrified. It was the last line that ran over the West Boston Bridge to be electrified; until then, its cars were hauled by horses to Central Square, then attached to electric cars from Allston for the remainder of the trip into Boston. On May 18, 1896, tracks opened from Union Square east along North Beacon Street and Commonwealth Avenue to Kenmore Square, merging with the existing tracks on Beacon Street. On June 13, the western terminal was also extended to just shy of Newton Corner (Nonantum Square). On November 8, 1897, Newton service via Commonwealth Avenue began running into the Tremont Street subway. A lengthy Nonantum Square‚Äì route via Allston, Coolidge Corner, and Park Square opened on August 4, 1900. On December 9, 1912, service was extended north to Watertown on the existing Galen Street tracks. During the early part of the 20th century, the line was also used for freight service. The Boylston Street subway was opened to an incline in Kenmore Square on October 3, 1914, with Watertown service via Brighton Center immediately routed into the new tunnel. The first use of high-capacity center-entrance streetcars on the BERy system was as trailers on the Watertown Line in mid-1915. On February 23, 1922, Oak Square short turns were extended to Watertown in the evening peak hour. The Blandford Street portal, on Commonwealth Avenue west of , opened October 23, 1932, marking the last change in the route of the service. In 1941, the line became the first line in Boston to have primary service with the new PCC streetcars, which replaced the Types 4 and 5 cars then in service. =North Beacon Street line= A 1910 postcard of two streetcars at the Public Garden incline. The left car is bound for Watertown via North Beacon Street; the right is bound for Park Street from Union Square. In June 1894, the West End applied for city permission to construct a line on North Beacon Street between Union Square and the Watertown border. The Newtonville and Watertown Street Railway soon secured position to build between and Union Square, with the intention to use the West End tracks to reach downtown Boston. After approval by the Watertown Arsenal (which owned a section of North Beacon Street) in 1896 ‚Äì despite the objection of the West End ‚Äì the company constructed the line in 1898. After further disagreements between its parent company Newton and Boston Street Railway and the BERy about operations, the line opened in 1900. Through service on the line between Watertown and the Tremont Street subway, acting as a branch of the Newton- Brighton line, began on November 18, 1900. The BERy took over the line from the Newton and Boston in 1907. The portion west of Market Street was among the only BERy lines never to be double-tracked. The Newton Street Railway (later the Middlesex and Boston Street Railway) began Waltham‚ÄìPark Street service via the North Beacon Street line on February 23, 1903. This service was rerouted to Central Square on April 27, 1912, running on Arsenal Street and Western Avenue rather than North Beacon Street. Oak Square‚ÄìBoston service via Western Avenue was also cut to Central Square. Watertown‚ÄìPark Street service via North Beacon Street remained. Upon the opening of the Boylston Street subway in October 1914, North Beacon Street service was cut to a Watertown‚ÄìUnion Square shuttle. It was further cut to a North Beacon Street bridge (the Brighton/Watertown line) ‚Äì Union Square shuttle on June 2, 1917. The North Beacon Street shuttle was replaced with a bus route on February 23, 1922. A Watertown‚ÄìArsenal Street bridge line, which ran on North Beacon between Watertown and School Street, was briefly run in 1925‚Äì26. The Central Square‚ÄìUnion Square line was rerouted via Western Avenue and Soldiers Field Road on December 14, 1925, with a new bus route on River Street. The bus route was extended to Union Square on September 11, 1926, replacing the streetcar line. The two bus routes were combined in February 1933 to eliminate the transfer; the route is now the route 64 bus. =Closure= The A branch ran in mixed traffic for much of its length, causing it to be slow and unreliable. Prior to 1967, when the current letters were assigned to the Green Line's branches, the Watertown Line was route 69. (Route 57, the line's current number, was originally assigned to short-turn trips on the Huntington Avenue line.) The line was assigned the letter \\"A\\" because it was the northernmost branch. Turnback loops existed at Union Square (via Cambridge Street and Harvard Avenue) and Oak Square, as well as the terminal. Additionally, from 1915 to January 15, 1962, a loop existed at Braves Field, for special events along the part of the line concurrent with the Commonwealth Avenue line. The opening of the Riverside Line in 1959 caused streetcar lines in Cambridge running out of Harvard Square to be converted to trackless trolley, and the newly freed PCC streetcars were reassigned to the Riverside branch. However, the 1940s-era PCC fleet was aging, and maintaining five different types of PCCs complicated mechanical work. By the late 1960s, wear and tear and a lack of replacements caused a shortage of Green Line streetcars, and the MBTA announced the closure of the A branch on a \\"trial\\" basis. The A branch was chosen for closure because much of its route consisted of street running sections from Watertown to Packards Corner, and in 1964 there had been objections to keeping the service past Newton Corner. Streetcars last ran on June 20, 1969, with the route 57 bus beginning the next day. =Track removal= Stub remains of A branch tracks at . The switch was disconnected in 2014. The legacy tracks remained after 1969, being used for several decades to allow Green Line streetcars to reach the Watertown Carhouse for maintenance. The last use of the line was in 1993, when the fleet of PCC streetcars used for the Ashmont‚ÄìMattapan high-speed line was refurbished at the Watertown carhouse. The electrified overhead wire was finally removed in March 1994. Additional overhead infrastructure, as well as the tracks themselves, were mainly removed by the end of the summer of 1996 as part of a resurfacing project on North Beacon Street. Remnants of the tracks are still visible today in the Watertown Yard bus terminal (no longer used for railcar maintenance), as well as a short stub track at Packard's Corner, where the \\"A\\" branch used to diverge from the \\"B\\" branch. The stub, part of the former outbound track, was used for temporarily storing disabled trains until it was shorted to just a few feet long in the mid 2000s; the switch was not disconnected until 2014. Restoration of the \\"A\\" branch was advocated to provide a one-seat ride to downtown Boston from the northern corridor (rather than requiring a transfer at Kenmore), but was ruled too costly and less safe compared to the replacement bus service. =Bus routes= Route 57 A route 57 bus at Kenmore in 2018 The 57 Watertown Yard‚ÄìKenmore station bus was initiated in 1969 as replacement service for the \\"A\\" branch. The 57 follows the same routing from Watertown Yard to except for the Newton Corner rotary, where inbound buses follow traffic rather than operating in a counterflow lane as streetcars had. As a way to make the service more attractive, the MBTA originally had the 57 operate as a limited (boarding-only outbound and dropoff-only inbound) between Packards Corner and Kenmore, with the \\"B\\" branch providing local service along Commonwealth Avenue. In December 2006 the 57 began making local stops on Commonwealth. Since free transfers had been previously eliminated by the M.T.A. in October 1961, Watertown riders had to pay a double fare to continue downtown after the bustitution. This continued until January 1, 2007, when a new fare structure added free transfers when using a CharlieCard. Additional short turn trips between Oak Square and Kenmore at rush hour were cut in June 1971, and restored for mornings only in 1987. Morning-only Brighton Center‚ÄìKenmore trips were operated from September 1999 to June 2013. On September 1, 2008, due to overcrowding on the inner part of the route, the MBTA began operating the 57A Oak Square‚ÄìKenmore station short turn of the 57 during weekday rush hours. Approximately every other trip operates as a 57A during rush hours; during off-peak hours and weekends all buses run the full-length route. Route 57 operates as a busy key bus route, with headways between 10 and 12 minutes at all times (and equal headways on the 57A during peaks). , the 57 and 57A combined were ninth-busiest route on the MBTA system, with 10,094 boardings on an average weekday. Route 57 is based at the Albany Street Bus Facility during weekday rush hours and midday service, and is based at the Cabot Garage for evening, weekend, and holiday service. One early-morning trip, intended for MBTA employees but open to the public, continues to on Mondays through Saturdays as 193 Watertown Yard‚ÄìHaymarket station. It was inaugurated along with several other routes by the M.T.A. in September 1960, though they were not listed in public timetables until September 1999. =Express buses= A route 501 bus in Brighton Center in 2016 The portion of the route west of Brighton Center is also served by four express routes operate to downtown Boston and Copley Square: *501 Brighton Center‚ÄìFederal Street & Franklin Street *502 Watertown Yard‚ÄìCopley station *503 Brighton Center‚ÄìCopley Square *504 Watertown Yard‚ÄìFederal Street & Franklin Street The 501 and 503 serve the same local streets but the 501 operates to downtown Boston and the 503 to Copley Square; the 502 and 504 operate similarly. All four routes enter the Massachusetts Turnpike at the Newton Corner rotary. Express bus service from Brighton and Watertown began even while the \\"A\\" branch was still running. The 61 Watertown/Newton Corner- Downtown Boston via Mass. Turnpike route began in July 1967, with Saturday service added in March 1968. In December 1967, the 61 was renumbered as 4, and a new route 61 running from Oak Square to downtown via Brighton Center and Union Square, Boston and the Turnpike was initiated. In September 1968, the 61 was changed to originate at Brighton Center, from where it ran through Oak Square and entered the Turnpike at Newton Corner. Route 62 Watertown-Copley was started at the same time. In June 1970, the routes were renumbered from 4, 61, and 62 to 304, 301, and 302 to reflect their express routings. (The 300-series numbers had been used by ex-Eastern Massachusetts Street Railway bus routes in Lawrence, briefly under MBTA control, in 1968). In March 1974, route 301 buses operating opposite the peak direction began using the pre-1968 routing on Cambridge Street. Inbound morning buses reverted to the Newton Corner routing in June 1974, but outbound afternoon buses continued to travel via Union Square. Some afternoon buses switched back to the Cambridge Street route in September 1976 and September 1978. All three routes had a number of minor changes to their downtown and Copley Square routings in the late 1970s and 1980s. Midday and Saturday service on the 302 began in January 1983; in December 1989, the midday and Saturday buses added a Copley Square stop as route 304 Watertown-Downtown via Copley. In September 1996, three routes were renumbered as the 501, 502, and 504. In January 2005, the 503 Brighton Center‚ÄìCopley Square route was inaugurated. Inbound afternoon trips began operating via Cambridge Street in March 2014.

The castle of Vetralla in a fresco in the Palazzo dei Priori, Vetralla. History Vetralla's dominating fortified position in the heart of Etruscan territories has been continuously occupied since the Early Middle Ages. The Roman site, two kilometers distant, was a posting station on the Via Cassia; some ruins of walls and paving at S. Maria di Forcassi still mark the Roman Forum Cassii. The site was depopulated in the later Empire, when a smaller population retreated to the present strategic position commanding the valley, where it remained exposed to attack, in spite of the imposing walls that encircled it. The little fortress had been incorporated into the Papal States from their historic beginnings with the Lombard king Liutprand's Donation of Sutri (728) to Pope Gregory II, but the lords of Viterbo held it from 1110 to 1134. By 1145, Pope Eugene III was installed at Vetralla, safely removed from the violence and party strife of Rome; from here he issued his bull Quantum praedecessores, calling for the Second Crusade. The territory was given extensive woodlands by Pope Innocent III in 1206, which brought it into fierce contention with the lords of Viterbo who coveted the land. To this day, in the annual ceremonial Sposalizio dell'albero (\\"marriage of the tree\\"), the mayor of Vetralla reaffirms the town's rights of possession on Monte Fogliano. The fief was entrusted through the centuries to various noble families associated with the Papacy, as lords of Vetralla: first the Orsini, then the Di Vico until 1435, when the last lord Giacomo di Vico was forcibly ousted by the cardinal-condottiere Giovanni Vitelleschi, confined in the fortress of Soriano, then beheaded. Vetralla then passed in rapid succession among a series of Papal nobles: to Cardinal Giovanni Borgia, to Lorenzo Cybo (1529), and to Cardinal Alessandro Farnese in 1534. Uniquely among non-English cities, in 1512 Vetralla received the protection of the English Crown, bestowed upon the town by Henry VIII, and a monument commemorating this event can still be found in the local town hall. http://www.romeartlover.it/Clodia2.html Main sights *Church of San Pietro *Church of San Francesco *Church of Sant'Angelo *Grotta Porcina *Church of Santa Maria in Forocasii *City and Territory Museum *Rock necropolis of Norchia Transportation Vetralle is reached by the SS Cassia national road.

The genus Habia was long placed with the tanagers (Thraupidae), but it is actually closer to the cardinals (Cardinalidae). Consequently, it can be argued that referring to the members of this genus as ant-tanagers is misleading, but no other common name has gained usage. Red- crowned ant tanagers are long and weigh (male) or (female). Adult males are dull reddish brown with a brighter red throat and breast. The black-bordered scarlet crown stripe is raised when the bird is excited. The female is yellowish brown with a yellow throat and yellow-buff crown stripe. The Red- crowned ant tanager is a shy but noisy bird. Its call is a rattle followed by a musical pee-pee-pee. This bird is a resident breeder from Mexico south to Paraguay and northern Argentina, and on Trinidad. Common in its wide range, it is not considered threatened by the IUCN. It preferentially occurs in the middle stratum of the forest as well as undergrowth rich in ferns, shrubs and herbs. These birds are found in pairs or family groups. They eat mainly arthropods, but berries are also taken. In Central America and Trinidad they frequently attend army ant columns, and in the lowland forests of southeastern Brazil they may be a nuclear species of understory mixed-species feeding flocks - though further uphill, e.g. in the Serra de Paranapiacaba, they seem to join such flocks only rarely and prefer to follow the ants on their own. They also follow South American coatis (Nasua nasua) on their feeding excursions, namely in the dry season. In both cases, they are commensales, snatching invertebrate prey startled by the ants or coatis. The shallow cup nest is usually built in a sapling or tree fern near a stream, and the normal clutch is two brown-blotched white eggs. The female incubates the eggs for 13 days prior to hatching, with about ten days more before the chicks fledge.

He is best remembered as the heroic commander of the Polish cavalry charge at the Battle of Somosierra. Biography Jan Leon Hipolit Kozietulski was born 4 July 1781 in Skierniewice in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. A friend of Wincenty Krasi≈Ñski, Kozietulski joined the Warsaw Honour Guard, with which he took part in the Battle of Pu≈Çtusk and the Battle of Preussisch Eylau. A distinguished cavalryman, in April 1807 he became the commanding officer of the 3rd Squadron of the Polish 1st Light Cavalry Regiment of the Imperial Guard, commanded by Krasi≈Ñski. In March 1808 Kozietulski reached Spain with his unit, where he took part in the Peninsular War. During the Battle of Somosierra, Kozietulski was the commander who led the Polish cavalry against the Spanish artillery and infantry. Although not the only commander present during the charge, he was credited with the victory after the battle and in Poland remains the best- known veteran of that campaign. He was also one of 18 Poles to be awarded the French Legion of Honour after the battle. Following the Peninsular War Kozietulski remained in the military and distinguished himself in the Battle of Wagram, where he led the Polish cavalry unit against other Polish cavalry units fighting alongside the Austrians. For his merits, in 1811 he became a baron of the empire. During Napoleon's invasion of Russia, Kozietulski again distinguished himself as a skilled commander during the Battle of Maloyaroslavets of October 25, 1812, where he saved the life of Napoleon himself, by charging between Bonaparte and the assaulting Cossacks. His uniform, pierced with a lance and stained with blood, is preserved to this day in the Museum of the Polish Army in Warsaw. After recovering from his wounds he returned to active service and took part in all major battles of Napoleonic 1813 campaign in Saxony. He also took part in the Battle of Nations. In 1814 he was made the commander of the French 3rd Scout Regiment of the Imperial Guard (). After Napoleon's defeat, Kozietulski returned to the Russian-held Polish Kingdom, where he became commander of the Polish 4th Uhlan Regiment. He died on 3 February 1821 in Ma≈Ça Wie≈õ Palace.

The document is very poorly preserved and has suffered considerable damage to the page edges, resulting in the loss of some of the text. The codex largely relates to a cycle of thirteen 20-year k ºatuns and includes details of Maya astronomical signs. The Paris Codex is generally considered to have been painted in western Yucat√°n, probably at Mayapan. It has been tentatively dated to around 1450, in the Late Postclassic period (AD 1200‚Äì1525). More recently an earlier date of 1185 has been suggested, placing the document in the Early Postclassic (AD 900‚Äì1200). However, the astronomical and calendrical information within the codex are consistent with a Classic period cycle from AD 731 to 987 indicating that the codex may be a copy of a much earlier document. The Paris Codex was acquired by the Biblioth√®que Royale of Paris in 1832 and is currently held at the Biblioth√®que Nationale de France in Paris, in the D√©partement des Manuscrits, catalogued as Mexicain 386.Noguez et al 2009, p. 17. Biblioth√®que Nationale de France 2011. Physical characteristics The codex consists of a strip measuring long by high, folded into 11 sheets painted on both sides, forming 22 pages total. An additional sheet is believed to have once existed, but became lost by the 19th century. The Paris Codex is very poorly preserved, comprising a number of fragments;Coe 1999, p. 200. the lime plaster coating of the codex is badly eroded at the edges, resulting in the destruction of its hieroglyphs and images except in the center of its pages.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 127. Content Page 3 of the Paris Codex, displaying the typical combination of a standing and a seated figure The content of the codex is mainly ritual in nature, and one side of the codex contains the patron deities and associated rituals for a cycle of thirteen k ºatuns (a 20-year Maya calendrical cycle).Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 127. Noguez et al 2009, p. 16. One fragment contains animals that represent astronomical signs along the ecliptic including a scorpion and a peccary;Coe 1999, p. 217. fragments of this Maya \\"zodiac\\" are depicted on two pages of the codex.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 118. Some pages of the codex are marked with annotations made with Latin characters.Noguez et al 2009, p. 16. On one side of the codex the general format of each page largely follows the same arrangement, with a standing figure on the left hand side and a seated figure on the right hand side. Each page also contains the ajaw day glyph combined with a numerical coefficient, in each case representing a date marking the final day of a calendrical cycle. In spite of the poor state of preservation of the document, enough text has survived to demonstrate that in the case of the Paris Codex, the main series of dates correspond to k ºatun-endings, allowing for the reconstruction of some of the lost date glyphs in the text. The seated figures are each associated with a sidereal glyph indicating that they represent the ruling deity of each k ºatun. The reverse of the codex is more varied in nature and includes a section dedicated to a calendrical cycle ruled by Chaac, the god of rain. A set of two pages illustrates the days of the tzolk ºin 260-day cycle that correspond to the beginning of the solar year over a period of 52 years (a cycle of the Calendar Round). The final two pages of the codex depict a series of thirteen animals that represent the so-called \\"zodiac\\". Origin In common with the other two generally accepted Maya codices (the Dresden Codex and the Madrid Codex), the document is likely to have been created in Yucat√°n; English Mayanist J. Eric S. Thompson thought it likely that the Paris Codex was painted in western Yucat√°n and dated to between AD 1250 and 1450.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 129. Bruce Love noted the similarities between a scene on page 11 of the codex and Stela 1 at Mayapan; based on this he proposed that the codex was produced in Mayapan around 1450.Rice 2009, pp. 32‚Äì33. However, further analysis of the stela in question suggests an earlier date of 1185 indicating that the calendrical information may refer to an earlier k ºatun cycle than the one suggested by Love. The astronomical and calendrical information within the Paris Codex are consistent with a Classic period cycle from AD 731 to 987 indicating that the codex may be a copy of a much earlier document.Vail 2006, p. 504. Discovery The Paris Codex came to light in 1859 when L√©on de Rosny found it in a basket of old papers in the corner of a chimney in the Biblioth√®que Imp√©riale in Paris.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 127. Drew 1999, p. 82. The codex had apparently been examined some twenty-five years earlier by scholars and had been catalogued but it is not known how the document found its way to Paris.Drew 1999, p. 83.

He played for the Detroit Tigers, New York Yankees and Cleveland Indians of the Major League Baseball (MLB). Brookens was on the Tigers coaching staff from 2009 to 2013, serving as first base coach and later third base coach. He was replaced as third base coach prior to the 2014 season by Dave Clark. Playing career On January 9, 1975, Brookens was drafted by the Detroit Tigers in the first round (fourth pick overall) of the 1975 MLB draft. In 12 MLB seasons, Brookens played 1,065 games at third base, 162 games at second base, and 119 games at shortstop. Tigers radio announcer Ernie Harwell nicknamed Brookens \\"the Pennsylvania Poker\\", a play on the song \\"Pennsylvania Polka\\". Brookens (left) playing third base for Detroit Brookens batted .246 in his 12-year career, with 71 home runs and 431 runs batted in (RBIs) in 1,336 games. His range factor (putouts and assists per game) was well above league average. He did lead American League (AL) third basemen in errors twice, in 1980 and 1985, but that was largely because he was getting to so many more grounders than other fielders; his range factor, which measures the number of plays a fielder makes, was consistently above league average. Brookens also has the dubious honor of sharing (with 21 others) the AL record for the most errors in a game by a third baseman, four, on September 6, 1980. Traditionally an infielder, Brookens found himself behind the plate in a game against the Texas Rangers on July 20, 1985. With regular catcher Lance Parrish hurt and Bob Melvin and Marty Castillo removed from the game in favor of pinch-hitters, Brookens (who had never caught a pro game before, even in the minors) filled the role and wound up catching five innings (11th through the 15th) before Detroit finally won the game. On August 20, 1980, Brookens went 5-for-5 with a triple and a home run, and also started a triple play in an 8‚Äì6 win over the Milwaukee Brewers. On September 18, 1984, Brookens hit an eighth inning solo home run into the left field seats at Tiger Stadium off of Milwaukee Brewers lefty Mike Caldwell on a 3-2 fastball. This was the clinching game leading the Tigers toward their 1984 World Championship. Besides, Brookens played winter baseball with the Leones del Caracas club of the Venezuelan League during the 1977‚Äì1979 seasons.Pura Pelota : VPBL batting statistics He won a World Series ring with the Tigers in 1984. As a manager Brookens in 2005 and 2006 was the manager of the Class A New York‚ÄìPenn League Oneonta Tigers in the Detroit Tigers minor league system. In 2007, Brookens was hired to lead the West Michigan Whitecaps which won the championship of the Class A ‚Äì Midwest League that year. After winning a championship with the Whitecaps, the Tigers promoted Brookens again in 2008, this time to the Erie SeaWolves, their Class AA ‚Äì Eastern League affiliate. As a coach Austin Jackson and Brookens, 2012 On November 9, 2009 the Tigers hired Brookens as their new first base coach. The move reunited Brookens with Tigers manager Jim Leyland, who had managed Brookens in the minor leagues in the 1970s. In 2013, Brookens was moved across the diamond to serve as the Tigers third base coach; he was mentioned as a possible future manager of the club when Leyland retired, but former catcher Brad Ausmus was named Leyland's replacement. Leyland selected Brookens to serve as bench coach for Team USA during the 2017 World Baseball Classic, coaching on a staff that included pitching coach Jeff Jones (who coached alongside Brookens with the Tigers from 2009 to 2013) and first base coach Alan Trammell, as teammate of Brookens from 1979 to 1988. Family Brookens' twin brother Tim was also drafted in 1975 by the Texas Rangers; he was later traded to the Tigers organization, but never made the majors. In spring training, Tim and Tom would sometimes switch identities, even suiting up in each other's uniforms; Tim is believed to have played at least one exhibition game disguised as Tom. Their cousin, Ike Brookens, pitched for the Tigers in 1975, while Ike's son Casey Brookens also played in the minors in the 1990s before retiring to become a high school coach in Pennsylvania.The Record Herald References External links , or Baseball Gauge, or Retrosheet Category:1953 births Category:Living people Category:Baseball coaches from Pennsylvania Category:Baseball players from Pennsylvania Category:Cleveland Indians players Category:Detroit Tigers coaches Category:Detroit Tigers players Category:Evansville Triplets players Category:Leones del Caracas players Category:Major League Baseball third basemen Category:Mansfield Mounties baseball players Category:Minor league baseball managers Category:Montgomery Rebels players Category:New York Yankees players Category:People from Chambersburg, Pennsylvania Category:United States national baseball team people ","title":"Tom Brookens"},{"id":"1903688","text":"Four Winds Field at Coveleski Stadium is a baseball stadium in South Bend, Indiana, home to the South Bend Cubs, a minor league baseball team which plays in the Class-A Midwest League. The stadium opened in 1987, and its open concourse is considered the template for many later minor league ball parks built in the 1990s. It has a capacity of 5,000 spectators. The park is named for Stan Coveleski, the hall of fame pitcher who once lived in South Bend. It is colloquially known as \\"The Cove\\". Coveleski Stadium is located on South Street in downtown South Bend. History Coveleski Regional Stadium, pictured before renovation and name change to Four Winds Field at Coveleski Stadium. Stanley Coveleski Regional Stadium was built in 1987 for $11 million under the leadership of then-Mayor Roger O. Parent. The facility is owned by the City of South Bend and managed by the South Bend Parks & Recreation Department. Stanley Coveleski was a Hall of Fame pitcher who settled in South Bend after his successful baseball career came to an end in 1929. The stadium is now affectionately known as \\"The Cove\\". The 5,000-seat stadium is worth an estimated $35 million to $40 million today. The stadium is home to the South Bend Cubs, a Class A minor league baseball team affiliated with the Chicago Cubs. The Cubs, for many years known as the \\"'Silver Hawks\\"', which play in the Midwest League, were originally named in homage to the Studebaker Silver Hawk, once made in South Bend. Originally affiliated with the Chicago White Sox, the team switched to the Diamondbacks in 1997 and to the Cubs for the 2015 season. Called \\"the grandfather of the modern ballpark\\" by BallParkReviews.com, Coveleski Stadium provided a design template for a move in recent years to bring ballparks back into City downtowns. HOK Sport Inc. (now Populous), original architect of Coveleski Stadium, also designed Oriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore and Cleveland's Progressive Field. On July 4, 1987, the stadium held a \\"Homerun Derby\\" to see who could \\"make history\\" by hitting the first home run out of the brand new park. Norm Bogunia, a 1985 graduate of South Bend's Washington High School and former baseball player there, was the first to hit a home run. He was joined by five other people who also hit home runs that day. LaSalle High School baseball coach Scott Sill ran the pitching machine. Two days later, on July 6, 1987, Joel Reinebold hit the first home run at the stadium during a regular game. A plaque hangs in the stadium with all the names of those who hit home runs. 200x200px =Redevelopment= In 2007, as Coveleski Regional Stadium celebrated its 20th anniversary, the City of South Bend began a redevelopment plan for the neighborhood surrounding the ballpark prompted, in part, by the relocation of the Gates automotive dealership to Erskine Commons on the city's south side. The City acquired nearly 15 contiguous acres of property surrounding the park as part of a strategy to encourage new mixed-use development near the stadium and enhance its connection with the core of downtown. In March 2017, construction began of a $22 million apartment complex, The Ivy at Berlin Place. The four four-story buildings will house 121 one and two-bedroom apartments overlooking the ballpark. Construction is expected to be completed by opening day of 2018. =Naming Rights= On September 5, 2013, it was announced that the stadium would be renamed Four Winds Field at Coveleski Stadium as a result of a new partnership with Four Winds Casinos. Ballpark Synagogue Ballpark Synagogue The 1901 synagogue building of the Sons of Israel Synagogue is now used as the South Bend Cubs' gift shop. During the off-season, it is available to be used for weddings, bar mitzvahs, and other events. It also hosts a yearly town ball in July. The restoration and imaginative reuse of a historic house of worship is regarded as part of Berlin's creative approach to enhancing fan experience, an approach that has included upgrading every part of the experience of visiting the ballpark, from food, to seating, to the ease of using the parking lot.

The local aboriginal Terek Cossacks joined this Cossack host later. In 1792 it was included in the Caucasus Line Cossack Host and separated from it again in 1860, with the capital of Vladikavkaz. In 1916 the population of the Host was 255,000 within an area of 1.9 million desyatinas. Many of the early members of the Terek Cossacks were Ossetians.Wixman. The Peoples of the USSR. p. 52 Early history It is unclear how the first Cossack community appeared on the Terek. One theory is that they were descendants of the Khazar state and of the Tmutarakan Principality, as there are records indicating that Mstislav of Tmutarakan in the Battle of Listveno in 1023 had Cossacks on his side when he destroyed the army of Yaroslav the Wise. This would mean the Slavic peoples of the Caucasus are native to the region having settled there much earlier.Thomas M. Barrett (1999) At the Edge of Empire: The Terek Cossacks and the North Caucasus Frontier, 1700‚Äì1860. Boulder, Colo: Westview Press. .) But later Terek Cossacks assimilated the first Terek Cossacks and introduced their own new agriculture.Thomas M. Barrett The Land is Spoiled By Water': Cossack Colonisation in the North Caucasus. Environment and History 5(1999): 27-52 The earliest known records of Slavic settlements on the lower Terek River date to 1520 when the Ryazan Principality was annexed by the Grand Duchy of Moscow and a lone group left and settled in the natural haven of the Terek River (modern northern Chechnya). The early settlement was located at the mouth of the Aktash River. This formed the oldest Cossack group, the Greben Cossacks (–ì—Ä–µ–±–µ–Ω—Å–∫–∏–µ –∫–∞–∑–∞–∫–∏ Grebenskiye Kazaki) who settled on both banks of the river. In 1559‚Äì71 the Tsardom of Russia, in the course of several campaigns, built several fortifications, during which the first Terka was built, later taken over by the still independent Cossacks. In 1577, after the Volga Cossacks were defeated by the strelets Ivan Murashkin, many scattered, some of whom settled in the Terek basin and Voevoda Novosiltsev built the second Terka on the Terek, marking the start of the Terek Cossacks. In 1584 this Terka was again taken over by Cossacks, some of whom were recruited by the Georgian king Simon I of Kartli. In a separate story, an ataman of the Don Cossack Host named Andrei Shadrin led a band of three Cossack sotnias to the Kumyk lands, founding a frontier town called 'Tersky' (location uncertain). This may have been partially motivated by his tense relations with Yermak Timofeyevich.Mikhail Astapenko \\"Donskiye Kazach'i Atamany\\" (Don Cossack Atamans) He subsequently founded Andreyevo (the modern Endirey), which was said to be named for him.. In the late 16th century several campaigns by the Terek Cossacks were carried out against the Ottoman Empire (Temryuk) which led the Sultan to complain to Ivan the Terrible. In 1589 the first outpost on the Sunzha was built and a permanent Terka, later known as Tersky Gorodok, was built on the lower Terek. 17th century During the Time of Troubles in 1606 four thousand Terek Cossacks left for the Volga to support their own candidate for the Tsar, Ileyka Muromets. By 1614 the Rowers supported the new Romanov monarch and aided him in quelling the unrest in Astrakhan. In 1633 they destroyed the remnants of the Nogay Horde and a decade later aided the Don Cossacks against the Crimean Khanate in 1646. By the mid 17th century the Cossacks again expanded into the Sunzha where they built a new outpost in 1651. Two years later the outpost withstood a hailing attack by Kumyks and Dagestanis. Though the battle ensured the Tsar's respect, it was advised that the Cossacks pull down the outpost. In the 1670s the Terek Cossacks helped to defeat Stenka Razin in Astrakhan. In 1680 after the Raskol in the Russian Orthodox Church reached the Don Cossacks, a number of Old Believers left the Don River and settled first on the Kuma and later on the Agrakhan. After the aid of the Terek and Rowing Cossacks to the Don Cossacks during the Azov Campaigns in 1695, the Ottoman Empire retaliated against the Terek Cossacks and in 1707 most of their outposts were destroyed on the right bank of the Terek. 18th century Terek Cossacks uniform of 1st Volgsky Regiment In 1711 Graf Apraskin re-settled all of the Rowing Cossacks on the left bank of the Terek River, this move was met with resentment, and during the entire 18th century the Terek Cossacks would still inhabit the left bank and use the rich vineyards and lands right up until 1799. Also in 1720 the Rowers and Tereks were fully incorporated into the Russian Empire and during the Russo-Persian War (1722‚Äì1723), the Cossacks aided Peter I of Russia in his conquest of the eastern Dagestan and the capture of Derbent. During the campaign the 1000 re- settled Don Cossacks on the Agrakhan and the Sulak formed the Agrakhan Cossack Host (–ê–≥—Ä–∞—Ö–∞–Ω—Å–∫–æ–µ –ö–∞–∑–∞—á—å–µ –í–æ–π—Å–∫–æ), which was united with the Terek Cossacks. In 1735 by a new agreement with Persia the Sulak line was abandoned, and Agrakhan Cossacks were re-settled on the lower Terek Delta, and the fort of Kizlyar was founded. Thus in 1735 three hosts were formed: Grebenskoye (–ì—Ä–µ–±–µ–Ω—Å–∫–æ–µ Rowing) from the descendants of the earliest Cossacks, Tersko- Semeynoye (–¢–µ—Ä—Å–∫–æ-–°–µ–º–µ–π–Ω–æ–µ Terek-Family) from the re-settled Agrakhan Cossacks up to Kizlyar, and Tersko-Kizlyarskoye (–¢–µ—Ä—Å–∫–æ-–ö–∏–∑–ª—è—Ä—Å–∫–æ–µ Terek-Kizlyar) from the Agrakhan Cossacks as well as Armenians and Georgians. When the Kalmyks arrived in the northwestern Caspian a combined campaign was waged against Temryuk during the Russo-Turkish War (1735‚Äì1739), where the Terek Cossacks were led by Atamans Auka and Petrov. In 1736 and again in 1765 the right bank of the Terek, still nominally Cossack property, was offered to Chechens who wanted to adopt Russian patronage and re-settle there (noting that historically, the lands immediately north of the Terek river were indeed Chechen before the Mongol invasion and even to a degree after it, and the Chechen highlands were dependent on their agricultural production).Jaimoukha, Amjad. The Chechens: A Handbook By the latter half of the 18th century, relations between the Cossacks and the mountain people began to sour. In 1765 the outpost of Mozdok was founded, which became an immediate target for Kabardins who attacked the Terek line and Kizlyar. In 1771 Yemelyan Pugachev arrived in Terek, and, to show loyalty, Ataman Tatarintsev arrested him. Pugachev fled and the Pugachev Rebellion in 1772‚Äì1774 gained no support on the Terek. Caucasus War (1770s‚Äì1860s) The Russo-Turkish War (1768‚Äì1774) and the resulting Treaty of K√º√ß√ºk Kaynarca gave Russia the pretext under which they could begin their expansion into the Caucasus, marking the start of the century-long Caucasus War. In 1769‚Äì1770 almost half of the Volga Cossacks were re-settled around Mozdok. In 1776 further settlers arrived including more of the Volga Cossacks (the remaining Cossacks on the lower Volga were separated into the Astrakhan Cossacks Host) and the Khopyor Cossacks from the eastern Don territory. These formed the Azov-Mozdok defence line. Major foreposts for Russian expansion into the central Caucasus were founded by the re-settlers including: Giorgiyevsk in 1777 by the Khopyor regiment, and Vladikavkaz in 1784. During this early phase several high-profile battles took place. In June 1774 Devlet-Girey sent a massive Kabardin Army against the Terek Cossacks, on 10-11 of June the stanitsa of Naurskaya was heroically defended against the invaders and in 1785 Kizlyar was defended against Sheikh Mansur. In 1788‚Äì91 the Terek Cossacks took part in three campaigns which took them to the Circassian port of Anapa in western Caucasus. The major gap in the western section of the line of defense was solved in 1792 when the Black Sea Cossacks were re-settled there. The next three decades brought severe difficulties for the Russian effort in the Caucasus. After the joining of Georgia to Russia in 1801 and the subsequent Russo-Persian War (1804‚Äì1813), the Terek Cossacks spared some men and took part in combat under Yerevan, but on the whole most of them were in constant defence of their home lines. All this changed when in 1816 General Yermolov took command of the Caucasus army. Having by now secured major strategic footholds in most of the North Caucasus and Georgia following the last war fought with Persia and the resulting Treaty of Gulistan, he found himself able to make major adjustments. In 1818 he changed the Russian tactics from defensive to offensive and began building the Sunzha-Vladikavkaz line where strongholds such as Groznaya and Vnezapnaya were founded. Yermolov further reformed the whole structure of the Cossacks and in 1819 replaced elected Atamans with appointed commanders. In Transcaucasia, Cossacks took part in the Russo-Turkish War (1828‚Äì1829) where they participated in the Siege of Kars and other key battles. After Yermolov was recalled from the Caucasus, a new reform took place and the interim regiments in the central Caucasus were united with the three Hosts on the Terek to form the Caucasus Line Cossack Host (–ö–∞–≤–∫–∞–∑—Å–∫–æ–µ –ª–∏–Ω–µ–π–Ω–æ–µ –∫–∞–∑–∞—á—å–µ –≤–æ–π—Å–∫–æ, Kavkazskoye lineynoye kazachye voysko) in 1832, and the new Nakazny Ataman was named Peter Verzilin. Several reforms followed: In 1836 the Kizlyar and Family regiments were united and made responsible for the Terek Delta, and in 1837 a Malorossiyan (Little Russian) regiment (formed in 1831 to combat the November Uprising in Poland) was resettled on the upper Terek north of Vladikavkaz. In 1842 the regiment was incorporated into the Line host. This was followed by the formation of the Sunzha regiment with its Ataman Sleptsov. By this point the Russian control in the Caucasus had improved, with the initiative firmly in the Cossack hands. Most of the battles took place in Chechen and Dagestani territories far away from Cossack homes. During the 1840s several successful expeditions were mounted deep into the mountains. The Line Cossacks participated in the Crimean War (1853‚Äì1856) and finally in the closing phase of the Russian advance against Shamil in 1859. Terek Cossack Host 1860‚Äì1920s Cossacks of the 2nd Mountain-Mozdok Regiment of the Terek Cossack Army The end of the Caucasus War marked the end of the Line Cossack Host. In 1860 it was divided, with the two western regiments joining the Black Sea Cossacks to form the Kuban Cossack Host and the remaining into the Terek Cossack Host. The next decade showed a gradual reform from military to civil control. In 1865 a permanent police force was formed, and in 1869 the Terek Oblast was formed, consisting of eight mountainous districts (populated by indigenous people) and seven Cossack subdivisions. Several regimental reforms followed: Kizlyar and Rower as well as Mountain and Mozdok regiments were united into two (reducing the number of sub-divisions to five), and in 1871 a charter for Terek Cossacks was published. From the 1870s onwards the Eastern Caucasus remained largely peaceful (if one discounts uprisings waged by the Chechens in the late 1870s and the occasional exchange of raids). However the Terek Cossacks took part in several Imperial Wars, including campaigns against Khiva in 1873. During the Russo-Turkish War (1877‚Äì1878) the Terek Cossacks sent six cavalry regiments, one Guards squadron and one mounted artillery regiment to the Balkans and a further seven regiments and mounted battery were mobilized against the rebelling Chechens and Dagestanis, who initiated an uprising against Tsarist authorities in 1878. In the 1880s the arrival of the railways and the discovery of oil made the Terek Oblast one of the wealthiest in the Caucasus, resulting in a large growth in Cossack and indigenous mountain populations. This created friction on land ownership. The Cossacks held extensive fertile areas in the lowlands and steppes, whilst the indigenous mountain populations only held land in the mountainous zones. Peace was preserved, by a complex Russian policy of supporting loyal clan leaders and free supplies of food and goods [–û—Ç–Ω–æ—Å–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ–µ —Å–ø–æ–∫–æ–π—Å—Ç–≤–∏–µ –≤ –ß–µ—á–Ω–µ —Ü–∞—Ä—Å–∫–æ–º—É –ø—Ä–∞–≤–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤—É —É–¥–∞–≤–∞–ª–æ—Å—å –ø–æ–¥–¥–µ—Ä–∂–∏–≤–∞—Ç—å –∑–∞ —Å—á—ë—Ç —Ñ–∞–∫—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –Ω–µ–≤–º–µ—à–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –≤–æ –≤–Ω—É—Ç—Ä–µ–Ω–Ω—é—é –∂–∏–∑–Ω—å –≥–æ—Ä—Ü–µ–≤, –ø–æ–¥–∫—É–ø–æ–º —Ä–æ–¥–æ-–ø–ª–µ–º–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–π –∑–Ω–∞—Ç–∏, –±–µ—Å–ø–ª–∞—Ç–Ω–æ–π –≤—ã–¥–∞—á–µ–π –º—É–∫–∏, —Ç–∫–∞–Ω–µ–π, –∫–æ–∂–∏, –æ–¥–µ–∂–¥—ã –±–µ–¥–Ω—ã–º –≥–æ—Ä—Ü–∞–º; –Ω–∞–∑–Ω–∞—á–µ–Ω–∏–µ–º –¥–æ–ª–∂–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–Ω—ã–º–∏ –ª–∏—Ü–∞–º–∏ –º–µ—Å—Ç–Ω—ã—Ö –∞–≤—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—Ç–µ—Ç–Ω—ã—Ö —Å—Ç–∞—Ä–µ–π—à–∏–Ω, –≤–æ–∂–¥–µ–π —Ç–µ–π–ø–æ–≤ –∏ –ø–ª–µ–º—ë–Ω] citation from . The Terek Cossacks took part in campaigns against Geok-Tepe in 1879 and in 1885 up to the Afghan border in Central Asia. =Uniform and equipment= Uniform of Russian Kizlyar-Grebensky 1st Cossack horse regiment Until 1914 the Terek Cossack Host wore a full dress uniform comprising a dark grey/black kaftan (knee length collarless coat) with light blue shoulder straps and braid on the wide cuffs. Ornamental containers (czerkeska) which had originally contained single loading measures of gunpowder for muzzle-loading muskets, were worn on the breasts of the kaftans. The kaftan had an open front, showing a light blue waistcoat. Wide grey trousers were worn, tucked into soft leather boots without heels. Officers wore silver epaulettes, braiding and ferrules, the latter in their czerkeskas.Preben Kannik, page 236, \\"Military Uniforms of the World in Colour\\", SBN=71370482 9 This Caucasian national dress was also worn by the Kuban Cossack Host but in different facing colors. Tall black fur hats were worn on all occasions with light blue cloth tops and (for officers) silver lace. A whip was used instead of spurs.page 591 of volume 27, The Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Eleventh Edition Prior to 1908, individual cossacks from all Hosts were required to provide their own uniforms (together with horses, Caucasian saddles and harness). On active service during World War I the Terek Cossacks retained their distinctive dress but with a dark waistcoat replacing the conspicuous light blue one and without the silver ornaments or blue facings of full dress. A black felt cloak (bourki) was worn in bad weather both in peace- time and on active service. The Terk and Kuban Cossacks of the Imperial Escort (Konvoi) wore a special gala uniform; including a scarlet kaftan edged with gold braid and a white waistcoat. Soviet period The arrival of the February and later the October Revolution caught most Cossacks on the front lines in Kurdistan. The unrequited mountainous peoples took full advantage of the crises, Chechens and Ingush on the Sunzha line wiping out several Cossack stanitsas. The Bolsheviks were able to establish themselves in Grozny and Vladikavkaz, though Denikin's Volunteer Army drove them out across the Caucasian lands to Astrakhan. Although Cossacks did form a substantial part of Denikin's units, the Terek Cossacks were mostly involved in fighting the Caucasus insurgency against their traditional adversaries (Denikin's units became known among native Caucasians for their brutality and their association with the Cossacks). In 1920 many Terek Cossacks were deported to Ukraine and the northern part of European Russia and a new Mountain ASSR was formed. This left the former Sunzha-Terek Mesopotamia triangle split by the returned Chechen land stretching through the middle. The remaining portions were formed by the Sunzha Cossack Okrug which also encompassed lands around Grozny. However, the Sunzha's importance to the Vainakh peoples as their historical territorial heart ensured that the early communists, mindful of the claims of indigenous peoples, would return it in order to turn them from the Mensheviks toward the Bolsheviks (to balance out the anti-Bolshevik Cossacks). A deadlock formed in the Northern Caucasus. On one hand, the Cossacks were very adverse to Bolshevism, and the latter responded with a Decossackization policy. On the other hand, many mountainous peoples were hostile to any Russian rule, Red or White (most originally looked to the Reds as a force also fighting against their foes, the Cossacks, but after the Reds began adopting similar policies as their Tzarist predecessors, resentment resurfaced), and continued fighting Russian/Cossack populations. In the end, the Red Army had to use Cossack tactics and hire local population to police the region. The idea of sandwiching a Cossack district within a Chechen autonomy was seen as a solution. In the 1930s, to make the mountainous autonomies more sustainable in economical terms, they were united with the remaining Cossack holdings: the Sunzha district was retaken by the Chechen-Ingush ASSR, the former capital of the Terek Oblast, Vladikavkaz became the administrative centre for North Ossetia, likewise the Kabardino-Balkar Autonomous Oblast was also awarded to Cossack territories. On the lower Terek, between 1923 and 1937, the Dagestan ASSR administered the extensive territory there (Kizlyar, Terek Delta). Thus by the start of the Second World War only the historical Terek Left-bank was not administered by autonomies. However, on the other hand, all these lands (northern Chechnya, Kizlyar, Little Kabarda, historical North Ossetia, East Prigorodny/Western Ingushetia, etc.) had historically been inhabited by Caucasian peoples before the end of the Caucasian Wars. Thus by the start of the Second World War only the historical Terek Left-bank was not administered by autonomies, however, most of the administration and urban population of those regions was dominated by ethnic Russians. This was paralleled with the gradual down-folding of anti-Cossack repressions and their eventual rehabilitation by the mid-1930s, including forming numerous units in the Red Army. Cossacks fought on both sides of the Second World War. Many Cossack prisoners of war joined Nazi Germany who promised to free their lands from Bolshevism. Terek Cossacks made up the Vth regiment of the 2nd Brigade of the 1st Cossack Division. Soon the war came to Cossack lands themselves, in 1942 the Nazi offensive Case Blue, and by autumn, the western regions of the former Terek Cossack Hosts were occupied. By November, the Battle of the Caucasus reached North Ossetia, and Germans were already making plans to lease the oilfields in Grozny. Most of the Cossack population took part in repelling the invader. During the 1920s and 30s, despite efforts of Soviet Union to pacify the mountainous peoples via different programmes, such as Korenizatsiya, there was still low-level criminal secession movements in the highlands. Nazi Germany decided to use this friction in creating a fifth column out of them. In the central Caucasus, these were the Karachay and Balkars who carried out low-level insurgency. Further east, these were the Vainakhs and an existing insurgency by a Khasan Israilov was fuelled by supplies via Nazi paradrops. By autumn 1942, the insurgency diverted significant Red Army resources, including aviation. However, after the Battle of Stalingrad the Germans began a mass evacuation from the Caucasus. The price that mountainous people paid was dear, in late 1943 as part of Soviet Collective punishment, Operation Lentil began, which saw a total deportation of all Chechens, Ingush, Karachay and Balkar people to Kazakhstan. In the aftermath, most of the land was portioned, between loyal mountainous peoples such as Kabardins, Ossetians and Dagestanis, and Russians and Cossacks. For example, a vast Grozny Oblast was created encompassing almost all of the historic lower-Terek Cossack lands, whilst North Ossetia took the Sunzha and Kabardin ASSR had central line cossack stanitsas. This status quo continued until the second half of the 1950s, when there was once again a cool-down in Soviet government towards Cossacks after the death of Joseph Stalin. In 1957, all of the deported mountainous people were rehabilitated, and their republics restored. However this was not done in previous borders, for example, the historic homeland of lower Terek, Naursky and Schyolkovsky districts were incorporated into the Chechen-Ingush ASSR, whilst the Kizlyar district was passed onto Dagestan. Old problems of land ownership quickly resurfaced, and many returning Chechens and Ingush, forbidden to re-settle in the mountains, were settled in Cossack stanitsas. The politics of Stagnationed USSR towards titular nations was also two-faced, on one hand all signs of nationalism were repressed, on the other hand Soviet authorities actively encouraged assignation of jobs and selection to the minorities rather than Russians. As a result, of the positive discrimination and better economic prospects in other regions of the USSR, many Russians migrated from the Northern Caucasus to other regions, such as the Tselina, Russian Far East and the Baltic Republics. Naturally, the high birth rate, of the mountainous peoples, meant that many sold their homes to them. Although this hid the historic adversity between Russians and Caucasus people, it never removed the tension, as both sides saw each other gaining favours at their expense. After 1990 During the perestroika, Cossacks once again took steps to re-create their nationality . Many Cossack organisations were formed throughout the former Host. However, in doing so, many wished to review the existing administrative borders in the Northern Caucasus, and return the Cossack regions, that belonged to the once Terek Oblast from the national autonomies. In Kabardino-Balkaria and North Ossetia and Dagestan this was resolved by granting the Cossacks full minority rights, that raised on par with titular nations, and today Cossacks play an important role in local administration, culture and development. In Chechnya and Ingushetia however, the situation was different. There was a long-running ethnic conflict between the Chechen returnees and the Russian settlers of the region. Before 1989, the Russians had dominated all parts of government as well as the workforce, but then this reversed with the \\"Chechen revolution\\" in 1990, where the Chechen and Ingush majority took control of the ruling of their homeland. Russians were left jobless as able Vainakh took their places. The Russian language remained in many schools and the Russians of the republic were not immediately made victims. Cossacks and Russians, unsurprisingly, were staunch foes of Chechen independence from Russia. Chechens feared that Cossacks were variously plotting to undermine the independence which they saw as a desperate necessity and to detach a large part of their state. The chronic economic hardship of Chechnya during and after the Soviet period and the large income gap between Russians and Chechens before 1990 also worsened tensions. For these reasons and for the centuries of fighting between Cossacks and Chechens, ethnic relations were highly hostile. President Dzhokkar Dudayev, himself married to a Russian, tried to suppress ethnic tensions, which he viewed as a destabilizing element to an already impoverished and internationally isolated republic. However, the statements of the President about \\"hospitality\\" were not convincing enough, and Dudayev had other priorities, such as handling the economic conditions inherited from the Soviet age and international isolation, another major problem. An exodus of ethnic Russians occurred, although its causes and intensity are disputed. Some sources say that virtually the whole Russian population that left (300,000 people) before the First Chechen War, which others dispute, saying that while tens of thousands (as opposed to 300,000) left,Unity Or Separation: Center-periphery Relations in the Former Soviet Union By Daniel R. Kempton, Terry D. Clark p.122Allah's Mountains: Politics and War in the Russian Caucasus By Sebastian Smith p.134 most left due to the First Chechen War during it; Russian sources claim it was due to anti-Russian discrimination and violence, whereas others (such as Russian liberals Boris Lvin and Andrei Illarionov,Boris Lvin and Andrei Iliaronov. Moscow News. 24 February ‚Äì 2 March 1995 and Western commentators Gall and De Waal<Carlotta Gall and Thomas de Waal. Pages 197, 227 see below) cite economic reasons and the loss of the previous disproportionate privilege held by the Russians during Soviet times, as well as the mass bombing of Grozny during the First Chechen War, where 4 out of 5 Russians in Chechnya lived. As noted by ethnic Russian economists Boris Lvin and Andrei Illiaronov, the rate and number of departures of ethnic Russians from Chechnya during 1991‚Äì94 was actually less than other areas (Kalmykia, Tuva and Yakutia). There is also dispute that Chechens were antagonistic towards ethnic Russians and Cossacks because they were ethnic Russian (as opposed to because of their hostility to Chechen statehood) - there were two originally ethnic Russian Chechen teips, and the president's wife was Russian. The Chechen clan system protects individuals from theft and murder because the whole clan would become involved, and one can join a teip - thus, those who didn't join teips (like the Cossacks) would be subject to theft by the poor, etc. Many of the educated elite also lost their positions in government, industry and academia to locals connected with those in power (which previously they had a vast advantage in due to the situation after the return of the Chechens from exile). Chechnya Advocacy Network. Refugees and Diaspora Nadteretchny, Naursky and Shelkovskoy raions of the Republic of Chechnya practically lost the traditional Cossack population. After an attempted coup against Dudayev (who was seen as a threat to Russian oil transit) failed, Moscow responded with a military operation to reconquer Chechnya (see First Chechen War); many Terek Cossacks jumped at the opportunity to show their loyalty, and formed volunteer units that operated with the Russian Army. These were created to fight in the Sunzha and Terek stanitsas against Chechens. During the Second Chechen War, once again Cossack units took part as an auxiliary support, and this time were allowed to establish in the Naursky raion, which still had a Russian minority; today the stanitsa of Naurskaya remains strongly associated with the Cossack movement in Chechnya. The two wars have brought large suffering to both the Cossacks and the Chechens.

He is often regarded as the most successful Lombard monarch, notable for the Donation of Sutri, which was the first accolade of sovereign territory to the Papacy. Early life Liutprand's life began inauspiciously. His father was driven to exile among the Bavarians, his older brother Sigipert was blinded by Aripert II, king of the Lombards, and his mother Theodarada and sister Aurona were mutilated (their noses and ears were cut off). Liutprand was spared only because his youth made him appear harmless, described as adolescens in Paul the Deacon's Historia Langobardorum (Book VI, xxii), suggesting that he was 'probably older than 19 but still in his twenties'. He was released from Aripert II's custody and allowed to join his father. Reign The reign of Liutprand, son of Ansprand, duke of Asti and briefly king of the Lombards, began the day before his father's death when magnates called to Ansprand's deathbed consented to make Liutprand his colleague. Liutprand's reign endured for thirty-one years. Within the Lombard kingdom he was considered a lawgiver of irreproachable Catholicity. A low-quality tremissis of Liutprand's. =Relations with the Agilolfings of Bavaria= At the opening of his reign, Liutprand's chief ally among neighboring rulers was the Agilolfing Theodo I, the Frankish duke of Bavaria. Theodo I's intervention on Ansprand's behalf helped him gain the throne. Theodo had taken him in, when he and his father were temporarily expelled by Aripert II in 702, and the hospitality was later cemented with a marriage connection: Liutprand took to wife the Agilolfing Guntrud. The core of Theodo's policy was resistance to the Merovingian mayors of the palaces in their encroachments north of the Alps, concerns that did not much occupy Liutprand, and maintaining strategic control of the eastern Alpine passes in what is now the Italian Alps, which did. In the spring of 712, Theodo‚Äôs son Theodebert, with Ansprand and Liutprand, attacked Lombard strongholds, and with the drowning of their fleeing rival Aripert, Ansprand's faction were back in power at Pavia. Theodo died in 717 or 718; under his successor the Lombard ties with the Agilolfing weakened. Until distracted by Byzantine politics in 726, Liutprand's chief warmaking energies were concentrated on taking Bavarian castles on the River Adige. =Byzantine wars= Italy after the conquests of Liutprand. Lombard territory shown in green, Byzantine territory in orange. In his early reign, Liutprand did not attack the Exarchate of Ravenna or the Papacy. But in 726, the Emperor Leo III made his first of many edicts outlawing images or icons (see the iconoclastic controversy). The pope, Gregory II, ordered the people to resist and the Byzantine duke of Naples, Exhiliratus, was killed by a mob while trying to carry out the imperial command to destroy all the icons. Liutprand chose this time of division to strike the Byzantine possessions in Emilia. In 727, he crossed the Po and took Bologna, Osimo, Rimini and Ancona, along with the other cities of Emilia and the Pentapolis. He took Classis, the seaport of Ravenna, but could not take Ravenna itself from the exarch Paul. Paul was soon killed in a riot, however. Eventually, Ravenna would capitulate to Liutprand with barely a fight (737). The first Moorish raids on Corsica began around 713-719 from the Balearic Islands to the west. Acting as the protector of the Church and its faithful, Liutprand subjected the island to Lombard government (c. 725), though it was nominally under Byzantine authority. Corsica remained with the Lombard kingdom even after the Frankish conquest, by which time Lombard landholders and churches had established a significant presence on the island. When the Saracens invaded Sardinia, Liutprand redeemed the body of Augustine about the year 720. He brought it with great ceremony to Pavia, and enshrined it in the Church of Saint Peter, which was then the cathedral of Pavia. He rescued the relics stationed on the island with great haste as well as with great expense, according to Paul the Deacon. =Donation of Sutri= Having just overwhelmed the Byzantine forces, though it was left to his heirs to make the final vestige of the Exarchate of Ravenna Lombard at last, Liutprand advanced towards Rome along the Via Cassia; he was met at the ancient city of Sutri by Pope Gregory II (728). There the two reached an agreement, by which Sutri and some hill towns in Latium (see Vetralla) were given to the Papacy, \\"as a gift to the blessed Apostles Peter and Paul\\" according to the Liber Pontificalis. They were the first extension of Papal territory beyond the confines of the Duchy of Rome. This was the beginning of the Papal States. In the meantime, Leo sent Eutychius, as Exarch of Ravenna, to take control of Italy. When Eutychius arrived at Naples, he made an agreement whereby Liutprand would attack the Pope if the Greeks aided him in subjugating the contumacious and independent southern Lombard duchies, the Duchy of Spoleto and the Duchy of Benevento. The dukes, Thrasimund II and Godescalc, surrendered -- though control of the duchies from Pavia was not to endure for long -- and the new exarch marched on Rome. At Rome, Liutprand camped on the far bank of the Tiber in the \\"Field of Nero\\" and arbitrated, returning to the exarch the city of Ravenna alone among the Byzantine territories and prevailing on the pope to restore his allegiance to the emperor (730). Santo Stefano in Bologna. This eighth-century Lombard sculpture bears the names of kings Liutprand and Ilprand, as well as of the bishop Barbatus. =Frankish relations= Following the death of Theodo, Liutprand turned from his former Agilolfing allies to bind himself to Charles Martel, duke of the Franks, whose son, Pepin the Short, he adopted and girded with arms at his coming of manhood. In 733 Liutprand promulgated the Notitia de actoribus regis, a series of six laws, presaging the later Frankish capitulary in structure. They sought to curb the usurpation by local administrators of public lands. In 735-736, a serious illness encouraged Liutprand to raise his nephew Hildeprand to co-kingship. In 736-737, Liutprand crossed the Alps with an army to help Charles expel the Moors from Aix-en-Provence and Arles. In 738, a long peace was broken by the rebellious Lombard duke of Spoleto, Thrasimund II. When the revolt was suppressed, with nephews of Liutprand established at Beneventum and Spoleto, the dukes fled to Rome and the protection of Pope Gregory III. Liutprand immediately began the conquest of the Ducatus Romanus, the province around Rome. After capturing Orte and Bomarzo, he arrived at Rome and besieged it. The Pope sent an embassy to Charles Martel to beg for aid, promising favour then and in the future world: the cover letter survives. Gregory conferred on him the title of patrician. Gregory's anti-Lombard rhetoric reached absurd heights considering Liutprand's orthodoxy; the Lombard king only wanted his rebellious dukes to face justice. Charles ignored the pope's excessive charges against his erstwhile ally and instead sent back his own embassy to mediate between the two Italian powers. Before any headway was made, however, both pope and Frank died. =Death= Plaque marking the casket containing Liutprand's bones in San Pietro in Ciel d'Oro in Pavia. Soon after the death of Gregory III (741), Zachary was elected to the Apostolic See; Liutprand happily signed a twenty-year peace and restored the cities of the Duchy of Rome of which he had taken possession. Soon after, his reign ended in peace. Having passed more years on the throne and come closer to bringing the entire peninsula under one rule than any of his predecessors, the great Lombard died in 744 and was buried in the church of San Pietro in Ciel d'Oro, in Pavia. Sources The main source for the career of Liutprand is the Historia Langobardorum of Paul the Deacon, which idealises Liutprand. It was written after 787 and covers the story of the Lombards from 568 to the death of Liutprand in 744. Though written by a Lombard from a Lombard point of view, it contains much information about the Eastern Roman Empire, the Franks, and others. References Further reading *Rich√©, Pierre.

In the 1790s, the host was re-settled to the Kuban River. It comprised the Caucasus Fortified Defence Line from the mouth of the Kuban River to the mouth of the Bolshaya Laba River. History Cossacks' graves in the steppe, SW Ukraine The Black Sea host played a crucial role in the Russo-Turkish War of 1787‚Äì1797. As a result, Catherine II rewarded them with the Kuban land in the North Caucasus (north of the Kuban River, south of the Yeya River and east of the Sea of Azov) by her decree of June 30, 1792. At that time the area was inhabited by a few Nogain steppe nomads. When Russia annexed the Crimean Khanate in 1783 it inherited the Crimean claim to this land. South of the Kuban were Circassians. Renamed the Black Sea Cossack Host in honor of the victories during the Russo-Turkish War, a total of 25,000 people made the migration in 1792-1794 from Ukraine, settling in the regions north of the Kuban River. Initially, the Black Sea Cossacks adhered to Zaporozhian traditions, such as the democratic election of the host government, but in time they adopted many Russian ways. Instead of a central Sich, they formed a defence line from the inlet of the Kuban River into the Black Sea to the inlet of the Bolshaya Laba River, and colonised the land north of this line with stanitsas. The Cossacks founded the administrative centre of Yekaterinodar (literally \\"Catherine's gift\\") in 1794. At the same time, however, the Black Sea Cossacks also sent men to many major campaigns of the Russian Empire, such as the suppression of the Polish Ko≈õciuszko Uprising in 1794 and the ill-fated Persian Expedition of 1796 where nearly half of the Cossacks died from hunger and disease. The Host sent the 9th plastun (infantry) and 1st joint cavalry regiments as well as the first Leib Guards (elite) sotnia to aid the Russian Army during the Patriotic War of 1812. The new host also participated in the Russo-Persian War (1826-1828) where they stormed the last remaining Ottoman bastion of the northern Black Sea Coast, the fortress of Anapa, which fell on June 12, 1828. In the course of the Crimean War, the Cossacks foiled attempts by allied forces to land on the Taman Peninsula, whilst the 2nd and 5th plastun battalions took part in the Defence of Sevastopol (1854-1855). The migration to Kuban, a part of the monument of Antin Holovaty in Odessa As the years went by, the Black Sea Cossacks continued their systematic penetration into the mountainous regions of the Northern Caucasus. Taking an active part in the finale of the Russian conquest of the Northern Caucasus (1817-1864), they settled regions as these were conquered. To aid them, a total of 70,000 additional ex-Zaporozhians from the Bug, Yekaterinoslav, and finally the Azov Cossack Host migrated there in the mid 19th century. All three hosts needed to be removed to vacate space for the colonisation of New Russia, and with the increasing weakness of the Ottoman Empire as well as the formation of independent buffer states in the Balkans, the need for further Cossack defensive presence in New Russia had ended. They migrated to the Kuban in 1860 and merged with the Caucasus Line Cossack Host, which consisted of migrated Don Cossack elements. Finally, in 1864, the Black Sea Cossacks and the Azov Cossacks were united into the Kuban Cossack Host, ninety years after the destruction of the Zaporozhian Sich. Administration Upon creation, the territory of the host was governed by the military government. Later, a dedicated military executive office was created, which was headed by the host's ataman. In military matters, this office was subordinated to Kherson's military governor and, since 1802, to the Crimean Inspectorate. In civil matters, the office was subordinated to the Governor of Taurida Governorate.

The trap is named after the French player Sire de L√©gal (1702‚Äì1792). Joseph Henry Blackburne (1841‚Äì1924), a British master and one of the world's top five players in the latter part of the 19th century, set the trap on many occasions. Natural move sequence There is a number of ways the trap can arise; the one below shows a natural move sequence from a simultaneous exhibition in Paris. Andr√© Cheron, one of France's leading players, won with the trap as White against Jeanlose: 1\\\\. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 d6 :The Semi- Italian Opening. 4\\\\. Nc3 Bg4 :Black pins the knight in the fight over the center. Strategically this is a sound idea, but there is a tactical flaw with the move. 5\\\\. h3 :In this position 5.Nxe5 would be . While the white queen still cannot be taken (5...Bxd1) without succumbing to a checkmate in two moves, 5...Nxe5 would win a knight (for the pawn). Instead, with 5.h3, White \\"puts the question\\" to the bishop which must either retreat on the c8‚Äìh3 diagonal, capture the knight, be captured, or as in this game, move to an insecure square. 5... Bh5 (see diagram) :Black apparently maintains the pin, but this is a tactical blunder which loses at least a pawn (see below). Relatively best is 5...Bxf3 (or 5...Bd7), surrendering the and giving White a comfortable lead in , but maintaining equality. 5...Be6 is also possible. 6\\\\. Nxe5 :The tactical refutation. White seemingly ignores the pin and surrenders the queen. Black's best course now is to play 6...Nxe5, where with 7.Qxh5 Nxc4 8.Qb5+ followed by 9.Qxc4, White remains a pawn ahead, but Black can at least play on. Instead, if Black takes the queen, White has checkmate in two moves: 6... Bxd1 7. Bxf7+ Ke7 8. Nd5 :The final position is a pure mate, meaning that for each of the eight squares around the black king, there is exactly one reason the king cannot move there.This version of the L√©gal Trap was presented in L√©gal versus Saint Brie The original game featured L√©gal playing at rook odds (without Ra1)George Walker, A Selection of Games at Chess (London: Gilbert and Rivington, 1835), p. 91. against Saint Brie in Paris 1750: 1\\\\. e4 e5 2.

However, research suggests that the of the game had been altered retrospectively in order to remove a flaw in the original game.A. Mazukewitsch, Verflixte Fehler (Berlin 1985), as cited by Stephan Maass, \\"Das Kuriosit√§ten - Kabinett [3 : Mysteri√∂se F√§lle der Schachgeschichte : ¬ªDas musikalisch-schachliche Operetten-Mysterium¬´] (PDF, 1.5 MB), originally in Clubzeitschrift des SC Weisse Dame, (vol. 11 no. 3), 22-8-1997; archived by the Wayback Machine from the Weisse Dame website, 24-6-2009; see also Ren√© Gralla, Das Seekadetten-Matt: Original und F√§lschung, an interview with Maass on the ChessBase website, 30-3-2011 Also the year 1750 is assumed to be wrong; it is more likely that the game was played in 1787, and that the original move order was: 1\\\\. e4 e5 2. Bc4 d6 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. Nc3 Bg4 5. Nxe5? Bxd1?? 6. Bxf7+ Ke7 7. Nd5# 1‚Äì0 :Here the combination is flawed, as with 5... Nxe5 Black could have gained a piece. It is reported that L√©gal disguised his trap with a psychological trick: he first touched the knight on f3 and then retreated his hand as if realizing only now that the knight was pinned. Then, after his opponent reminded him of the touch-move rule, he played Nxe5, and the opponent grabbed the queen without thinking twice. Other variations { align=\\"left\\" border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" -valign=\\"top\\"    } Considerations This kind of mate, where an apparently pinned knight moves anyway, allowing capture of the queen, but leading to a checkmate with minor pieces, occasionally occurs at lower levels of play, though masters would not normally fall for it. According to Bjerke (Spillet i mitt liv), the L√©gal Trap has ensnared countless unwary players. One author writes that \\"Blackburne sprang it several hundreds of times during his annual tours.\\"Francis J. Wellmuth The Golden Treasury of Chess; Chess Review 1943, p. 147. In general, setting up a \\"trap\\" by luring a bishop into a queen capture is not strictly necessary. Any game featuring an advanced knight and Bxf7+ (or ...Bxf2+) followed by mate with minor pieces would be considered a L√©gal Mate. The mate succeeds because the square of the advanced knight is unguarded, and the enemy king is blocked by several of its own pieces.

It's thought to be named because of the supposed chickens owned by residents of other nearby islands who travel here to collect the eggs; however, there are no chickens on Egg Island. Another theory is that local sea bird eggs were often collected here by the first settlers, these were then wiped out by the introduction of goats to the island a long time ago.Lewis, Monty and Sarah (2015) \\"Explorer Chartbook, ffar Bahamas, 6th edition.

Lulu.com. Off the island is the wreck of the Arimoroa. Recently, Egg Island has gained international recognition after Disney Cruise Lines started exploring the area for possible development of a cruise ship port. This project would have entailed dredging the sea bed to make way for a cruise ship port, drilling into and destroying coral reefs. Residents of nearby Spanish Wells and north Eleuthera were extremely concerned at the implications and started a petition to have the sale of Egg Island to Disney halted. The primary concern is that Egg Island is a natural nursery for sea turtles, juvenile fish including snapper and grouper, crawfish (lobster), conch, stingrays, sea birds and other wild sealife, and any disturbance to the delicate eco-system would prove fatal to these animals and by default, detrimental to the local fishing industry. After the petition was signed by thousands and much agitation, Disney announced that due to the environmental impact, they would not proceed with the project. Joseph Darville spoke on behalf of local environmental organisation Save the Bays and Waterkeepers Bahamas, stating in a public release, \\"‚ÄúThe corporate entity, Disney Cruise Lines, demonstrated responsibility and made the right choice. The community got together and spoke in a voice that could not be ignored about an activity that would have changed their way of life and could have destroyed much of the fish population on which they depend for their livelihood because the reefs and the mangroves around Egg Island are important fish, conch and crawfish nurseries and habitats. And the environmental impact assessment did what it was created for. Based on science, not emotion, it showed that there would have been damage and destruction of the marine environment.‚Äù A comment on the Disney blog placed the blame for the situation on the Bahamian government, stating that If Bahamians want to protect their lands they should focus efforts on their own government.

He was the nephew of the general Wei Qing and Empress Wei Zifu (Emperor Wu's wife), and the half-brother of the statesman Huo Guang. Along with Wei Qing, he led a campaign into the Gobi Desert of what is now Mongolia to defeat the Xiongnu nomadic confederation, winning decisive victories such as the Battle of Mobei in 119 BC. Early life Huo Qubing was an illegitimate son from the love affair between Wei Shaoer (), the daughter of a lowly maid from the household of Princess Pingyang (Emperor Wu's older sister), and Huo Zhongru (), a low- ranking civil servant employed there at the time.ÈúçÂéªÁóÖÔºåÂ§ßÂ∞áËªçÈùíÂßäÂ∞ëÂÖíÂ≠ê‰πü„ÄÇÂÖ∂Áà∂Èúç‰ª≤Â≠∫ÂÖà‰∏éÂ∞ëÂÖíÈÄöÔºåÁîüÂéªÁóÖ However, Huo Zhongru did not want to marry a lower class serf girl like Wei Shaoer, so he abandoned her and went away to marry a woman from his home town instead. Wei Shaoer insisted on keeping the child, raising him with help of her siblings. When Huo Qubing was around two years old, his younger aunt Wei Zifu, who was serving as an in-house singer/dancer for Princess Pingyang, caught the attention of the young Emperor Wu, who took her and her half- brother Wei Qing back to his palace in the capital, Chang'an. More than a year later, the newly favoured concubine Wei Zifu became pregnant with Emperor Wu's first child, earning her the jealousy and hatred of Emperor Wu's then empress consort, Empress Chen. Empress Chen's mother, Grand Princess Guantao (), then attempted to retaliate against Wei Zifu by kidnapping and attempting to murder Wei Qing, who was then serving as a horseman at the Jianzhang Camp (Âª∫Á´†Ááü, Emperor Wu's royal guards). After Wei Qing was rescued by fellow palace guards led by his close friend Gongsun Ao (), Emperor Wu took the opportunity to humiliate Empress Chen and Princess Guantao by promoting Wei Zifu to a consort (Â§´‰∫∫, a concubine position lower only to the Empress) and Wei Qing to the triple role of Chief of Jianzhang Camp (), Chief of Staff (), and Chief Councillor (), effectively making him one of Emperor Wu's closest lieutenants. The rest of the Wei family were also well rewarded, including the decreed marriage of Wei Shaoer's older sister Wei Junru () to Emperor Wu's adviser, Gongsun He (). At the time, Wei Shaoer was romantically engaged with Chen Zhang (), a great-grandson of Emperor Gaozu's adviser Chen Ping. Their relationship was also legitimized by Emperor Wu through the form of decreed marriage.ÂèäË°õÁöáÂêéÂ∞äÔºåÂ∞ëÂÖíÊõ¥ÁÇ∫Ë©π‰∫ãÈô≥ÊéåÂ¶ª„ÄÇ Through the rise of the Wei family, the young Huo Qubing grew up in prosperity and prestige. Military career Huo Qubing exhibited outstanding military talent even as a teenager. Emperor Wu saw Huo's potential and made Huo his personal assistant. Huo Qubing's campaign against Xiongnu is shown in red In 123 BC, Emperor Wu sent Wei Qing from Dingxiang () to engage the invading Xiongnu, and appointed the 18-year-old Huo Qubing to serve as the Captain of Piaoyao () under his uncle,Â§ßÂ∞áËªçÂßäÂ≠êÈúçÂéªÁóÖÂπ¥ÂçÅÂÖ´ÔºåÂπ∏ÔºåÁÇ∫Â§©Â≠ê„É∞‰∏≠„ÄÇÂñÑÈ®éÂ∞ÑÔºåÂÜçÂæûÂ§ßÂ∞áËªçÔºåÂèóË©îËàáÂ£ØÂ£´ÔºåÁÇ∫ÂâΩÂßöÊ†°Â∞â„ÄÇ seeing real combat for the first time. Although Wei Qing was able to kill or capture more than 10,000 Xiongnu soldiers, part of his vanguard forces, a 3,000-strong regiment commanded by generals Su Jian (ËòáÂª∫, father of the Han diplomat and statesman, Su Wu) and Zhao Xin (Ë∂ô‰ø°, a surrendered Xiongnu prince) was outnumbered and annihilated after encountering the Xiongnu force led by Yizhixie Chanyu (). Zhao Xin defected on the field with his 800 ethnic Xiongnu subordinates, while Su Jian escaped after losing all his men in the desperate fighting. Due to the loss of this detachment, Wei Qing's troops did not earn any promotion, but Huo Qubing distinguished himself by leading a long-distance search-and-destroy mission with 800 light cavalrymen,ËàáËºïÂãáÈ®éÂÖ´ÁôæÁõ¥Ê£ÑÂ§ßËªçÊï∏ÁôæÈáåËµ¥Âà©ÔºåÊñ¨ÊçïÈ¶ñËôúÈÅéÁï∂„ÄÇ killing the Chanyu's grandfather and over 2,000 enemy troops, as well as capturing numerous Xiongnu nobles.

During spring, Huo Qubing led 10,000 cavalry, fought through five Western Regions kingdoms within 6 days, advanced over 1,000 li over Mount Yanzhi (), killed two Xiongnu princes along with nearly 9,000 enemy troops, and captured several Xiongnu nobles as well as the golden statue used by Xiongnu as an artifact for holy rituals.Á•®È®éÂ∞áËªçÁéáÊàéÂ£´ÈÄæÁÉèÈü°ÔºåË®éËÑ©ÊøÆÔºåÊ∂âÁãêÂ•¥ÔºåÊ≠∑‰∫îÁéãÂúãÔºåËºúÈáç‰∫∫ÁúæÊîùËÆãËÄÖÂºóÂèñÔºåÂá†Áç≤ÂñÆ‰∫éÂ≠ê„ÄÇËΩâÊà∞ÂÖ≠Êó•ÔºåÈÅéÁÑâÊîØÂ±±ÂçÉÊúâ‰ΩôÈáåÔºåÂêàÁü≠ÂÖµÔºåÈèñÁöãËò≠‰∏ãÔºåÊÆ∫ÊäòËò≠ÁéãÔºåÊñ¨Áõß‰æØÁéãÔºåÈä≥ÊÇçËÄÖË™ÖÔºåÂÖ®Áî≤Áç≤‰∏ëÔºåÂü∑Ê∏æÈÇ™ÁéãÂ≠êÂèäÁõ∏Âúã„ÄÅÈÉΩÂ∞âÔºåÊç∑È¶ñËôúÂÖ´ÂçÉ‰πùÁôæÂÖ≠ÂçÅÁ¥öÔºåÊî∂‰ºëÂ±†Á•≠Â§©Èáë‰∫∫ÔºåÂ∏´ÁéáÊ∏õ‰ªÄ‰∏É For this achievement, his march was increased by 2,200 households.ÁõäÂ∞ÅÂéªÁóÖ‰∫åÂçÉ‰∫åÁôæÊà∂ During the summer of the same year, Xiongnu attacked the Dai Commandery and Yanmen. Huo Qubing set off from Longxi (modern-day Gansu) with over 10,000 cavalry, supported by Gongsun Ao, who set off from the Beidi Commandery (ÂåóÂú∞ÈÉ°, modern-day Huan County, Gansu). Despite Gongsun Ao failing to keep up, Huo Qubing travelled over 2,000 li without backup, all the way past Juyan Lake to Qilian Mountains, killing over 30,000 Xiongnu soldiers and capturing a dozen Xiongnu princes. His march was then increased further by a 5,400 households for the victory. Huo Qubing's victories dealt heavy blows to the tribes of the Xiongnu princes of Hunxie () and Xiutu () that occupied the Hexi Corridor. Out of frustration, Yizhixie Chanyu wanted to mercilessly execute those two princes as punishment. The Prince of Hunxie contacted the Han government in autumn of 121 BC to negotiate a surrender. Failing to persuade his fellow prince to do the same, he killed the Prince of Xiutu and ordered Xiutu's forces to also surrender. When the two tribes went to meet the Han forces, Xiutu's forces rioted. Seeing the situation changed, Huo Qubing alone headed to the Xiongnu camp. There, the general ordered the Prince of Hunxie to calm his men and stand down before putting down 8,000 Xiongnu men who refused to disarm, effectively quelling the riot. The Hunxie tribe was then resettled into the Central Plain. The surrender of the Xiutu and Hunxie tribes stripped Xiongnu of any control over the Western Regions, depriving them of a large grazing area. As a result, Han Dynasty successfully opened up the Northern Silk Road, allowing direct trade access to Central Asia. This also provided a new supply of high-quality horse breeds from Central Asia, including the famed Ferghana horse (ancestors of the modern Akhal-Teke), further strengthening the Han army. Emperor Wu then reinforced this strategic asset by establishing five commanderies and constructing a length of fortified wall along the border of the Hexi Corridor. He colonised the area with 700,000 Chinese soldier- settlers. After the series of defeats by Wei Qing and Huo Qubing, Yizhixie Chanyu took Zhao Xin's advice and retreated with his tribes to the north of the Gobi Desert, hoping that the barren land would serve as a natural barrier against Han offensives. Emperor Wu however, was far from giving up, and planned a massive expeditionary campaign in 119 BC. Han forces were deployed in two separate columns, each consisting of 50,000 cavalry and over 100,000 infantry, with Wei Qing and Huo Qubing serving as the supreme commander for each. Emperor Wu, who had been distancing Wei Qing and giving the younger Huo Qubing more attention and favour, hoped that Huo would engage the stronger Chanyu's tribe and preferentially assigned him the most elite troopers. The initial plan called for Huo Qubing to attack from Dingxiang (ÂÆöË•Ñ, modern-day Qingshuihe County, Inner Mongolia) and engage the Chanyu, with Wei Qing supporting him in the east from Dai Commandery (‰ª£ÈÉ°, modern-day, Yu County, Hebei) to engage the Left Worthy Prince (). However, a Xiongnu prisoner of war confessed that the Chanyu's main force was at the east side. Unaware that this was actually false information provided by the Xiongnu, Emperor Wu ordered the two columns to switch routes, with Wei Qing now setting off on the western side from Dingxiang, and Huo Qubing marching on the eastern side from the Dai Commandery. Battles at the eastern Dai Commandery theatre were quite straightforward, as Huo Qubing's forces were far superior to their enemies. Huo Qubing advanced over 2,000 li and directly engaged the Left Worthy Prince in a swift and decisive battle. He quickly encircled and overran the Xiongnu, killing over 70,000 men, and capturing three lords and 83 nobles, while suffering a 20% casualty rate that was quickly resupplied from local captives. He then went on to conduct a series of rituals upon his arrival at the Khentii Mountains (ÁãºÂ±ÖËÉ•Â±±, and the more northern ÂßëË°çÂ±±) to symbolize the historic Han victory, then continued his pursuit as far as Lake Baikal (), effectively annihilating the Xiongnu clan and allowing conquering tribe such as the Donghu People to retake back their land to establish their own confederacy to declared independent from Xiongnu Overlord following the subjugation for over a few decade.

Huo Qubing died in 117 BC at the early age of 23. After Huo Qubing's death, the aggrieved Emperor Wu ordered the elite troops from the five border commanderies to line up all the way from Chang'an to Maoling, where Huo Qubing's tomb was constructed in the shape of the Qilian Mountains to commemorate his military achievements.Â§©Â≠êÊÇº‰πãÔºåÁôºÂ±¨ÂúãÁéÑÁî≤ËªçÔºåÈô≥Ëá™Èï∑ÂÆâËá≥ËåÇÈôµÔºåÁÇ∫ÂÜ¢Ë±°Á•ÅÈÄ£Â±±„ÄÇ Huo Qubing was then posthumously appointed the title Marquess of Jinghuan (),Ë¨ö‰πãÔºåÂπ∂Ê≠¶ËàáÂª£Âú∞Êõ∞ÊôØÊ°ì‰æØ„ÄÇ and a large \\"Horse Stomping Xiongnu\\" () stone statue was built in front of his tomb, near Emperor Wu's tomb of Maoling. Huo Qubing was among the most decorated military commanders in Chinese history. The Eastern Han Dynasty historian Ban Gu, summarized in his Book of Han Huo Qubing's achievements with a poem: > The Champion of Piaoji, fast and brave. > Six long-distance assaults, like lightning and thunder. > Watering horse at Lake Baikal, conducting rituals at Khentii Mountains. > Conquering the area west of great river, establishing commanderies along > Qilian Mountains. > Á•®È®éÂÜ†ËªçÔºåÁåãÂãáÁ¥õÁ¥úÔºåÈï∑È©ÖÂÖ≠ÊìßÔºåÈõªÊìäÈõ∑ÈúáÔºåÈ£≤È¶¨Áø∞Êµ∑ÔºåÂ∞ÅÁãºÂ±ÖÂ±±ÔºåË•øË¶èÂ§ßÊ≤≥ÔºåÂàóÈÉ°Á•ÅÈÄ£„ÄÇ Huo Qubing's half-brother, Huo Guang, whom he took custody away from his father, was later a great statesman who was the chief counsel for Emperor Zhao, and was instrumental in the succession of Emperor Xuan to the throne after Emperor Zhao's death. Huo Qubing's son, Huo Sh√†n (), succeeded him as the Marquess of Jinghuan but died young in 110 BC. So Huo Qubing's title became extinct. His grandson Huo ShƒÅn (ÈúçÂ±±, later Marquess of Leping) and Huo Yun (Èúç‰∫ë, later Marquess of Guanyang) were involved in a failed plot to overthrow Emperor Xuan of Han in 66 BC, resulting in both of them committing suicide and the Huo clan being executed. It was presumably that no male descendant of Huo Qubing nor Huo Guang survived, as during the reign of Emperor Ping of Han, it was Huo Yang, a great-grandson of Huo Qubing's paternal cousin, who was chosen as the descendant of Huo Guang to be the Marquess of Bolu.  Popular culture  Huo Qubing is one of the 32 historical figures who appear as special characters in the video game Romance of the Three Kingdoms XI by Koei. Huo Qubing was played by Li Junfeng () in the popular 2005 historical epics TV series The Emperor in Han Dynasty (). Huo Qubing was played by Eddie Peng () under the name of Wei Wuji () in the popular romance Chinese drama Sound of the Desert () derived from the book Da Mo Yao/Ballad of the Desert () by famous novel writer Tong Hua. Huo Qubing is also mentioned in the blockbuster film Dragon Blade, where the main character, played by Jackie Chan, is said to have been raised up by him.

He graduated from New York University in 1916 with a degree in business administration.  Career  He served two and a half years in the U.S. Navy during World War I, then launched his financial-services career as a bond salesman for N. W. Halsy & Company in New York City with a single building, the Woolworth Building, as his first territory. Later, as a field representative for New York-based Blair & Co., Edward Jones moved to Ohio, then to St. Louis, where he left the company because of a dispute about his proceeds from a sale. In Ohio he was a livestock auctioneer, later using his knowledge of livestock to raise mules and cattle in Missouri. On April 19, 1923, Jones married Ursula Griesedieck. They had four children, Ann, David, who died as a child, Martha and Edward D. \\"Ted\\" Jones. Ursula's family owned breweries including Stag Beer. Before the ratification of the 21st Amendment, repealing prohibition, Jones persuaded the family to take the company's stock public. When his father-in-law died around 1945, Jones was named president and chairman of the board of the company. He divided his days, working at Edward D. Jones & Co. in the morning and at Griesedieck in the afternoon. He sold Stag Beer's assets in 1954. = Edward D. Jones & Co. = In 1922, he founded Edward D. Jones & Co. in St. Louis as a conventional brokerage house. In 1942, Jones payed $21,000 plus $4,000 in transfer fees for a seat on the New York Stock Exchange. In 1943, Edward D. Jones & Co. merged with Whittaker & Co., which was established in 1871 and was then the oldest brokerage firm west of the Mississippi River. Edward D. Jones & Co. opened its first branch office in 1957, in Mexico, Missouri. Jones turned over the management of the Edward D. Jones & Co. to his son, Ted, in 1968, and reduced his own workload in 1979. However, he continued to insist on being the first person in the office every day until his death in 1982 at the age of 89. Jones' wife Ursula predeceased him by one year, dying in 1981. At the time of Jones' death, Edward D. Jones & Co. had grown to 495 branches in 33 states.

Formation The band was formed in 1997 by the guitarist Sarah Utter, after recruiting her high-school friend Jesse Fox on drums and Maggie Vail. Vail had to learn how to play bass guitar to be in the band, as the only instruments she played before were drums, guitar, cello and clarinet. Tours Bangs toured with and/or played shows with bands including Sleater-Kinney, the Gossip, Unwound, Blonde Redhead, The Makers, The Donnas, Shannon Wright, Murder City Devils and Karp. Vail also played bass guitar in Frenchie and the German Girls, and sang backing vocals in the famous party-band Gene Defcon. Utter played in one of the last incarnations of Witchypoo, as well as Plastique. Fox left the band after a long U.S. tour, and Bangs went through a succession of drummers (Heather Dunn, Kyle Ermatinger) before settling with Olympia's Peter David Connelly. They recorded their last EP, Call and Response, in a frigidly cold farmhouse basement with the engineer Justin Trosper of Unwound. Although the band had associations with the riot grrrl movement (Vail's sister is Bikini Kill's Tobi Vail), Bangs did not regard itself as a riot grrrl band and preferred the term \\"rock band\\", crediting The Go-Go's, The Ramones, and Cheap Trick as inspirations. All of the band's releases were on Kill Rock Stars except for one single, released on Olympia label Ten-In-One Records. They toured the United States extensively, and also played shows in England, Scotland, Australia and New Zealand, where they were featured on the country's national news. Break up Bangs broke up in September 2004 after Utter moved to Los Angeles. Their last show was at Olympia's Eagles Hall as part of Kill Rock Stars' 'Yeah! Fest!'. Vail has since relocated to Portland, Oregon, where she plays in the bands Romancing and Leti Angel. Peter David still lives in Olympia and plays in The Mona Reels as well as other groups such as The November Witch, Tumwater Video and The Devon Williams Band. Utter has since moved back to the northwest and spends her time painting and playing bass guitar with Craig Extine and Kris Cunningham in the band Western Hymn. 2010 reunion In July 2010, the band reunited for four shows. One warm up gig in Olympia was followed by three shows (Portland, Olympia, and Seattle) benefiting their friend, Natalie Cox's, cancer fund.

A sensory substitution system consists of three parts: a sensor, a coupling system, and a stimulator. The sensor records stimuli and gives them to a coupling system which interprets these signals and transmits them to a stimulator. In case the sensor obtains signals of a kind not originally available to the bearer it is a case of sensory augmentation. Sensory substitution concerns human perception and the plasticity of the human brain; and therefore, allows us to study these aspects of neuroscience more through neuroimaging. Sensory substitution systems may help people by restoring their ability to perceive certain defective sensory modality by using sensory information from a functioning sensory modality. History The idea of sensory substitution was introduced in the '80s by Paul Bach-y-Rita as a means of using one sensory modality, mainly taction, to gain environmental information to be used by another sensory modality, mainly vision. Thereafter, the entire field was discussed by Chaim-Meyer Scheff in \\"Experimental model for the study of changes in the organization of human sensory information processing through the design and testing of non-invasive prosthetic devices for sensory impaired people\\". The first sensory substitution system was developed by Bach-y-Rita et al. as a means of brain plasticity in congenitally blind individuals. After this historic invention, sensory substitution has been the basis of many studies investigating perceptive and cognitive neuroscience. Since then, sensory substitution has contributed to the study of brain function, human cognition and rehabilitation. Physiology When a person becomes blind or deaf they generally do not lose the ability to hear or see; they simply lose their ability to transmit the sensory signals from the periphery (retina for visions and cochlea for hearing) to brain. Since the vision processing pathways are still intact, a person who has lost the ability to retrieve data from the retina can still see subjective images by using data gathered from other sensory modalities such as touch or audition. In a regular visual system, the data collected by the retina is converted into an electrical stimulus in the optic nerve and relayed to the brain, which re-creates the image and perceives it. Because it is the brain that is responsible for the final perception, sensory substitution is possible. During sensory substitution an intact sensory modality relays information to the visual perception areas of the brain so that the person can perceive sight. With sensory substitution, information gained from one sensory modality can reach brain structures physiologically related to other sensory modalities. Touch-to-visual sensory substitution transfers information from touch receptors to the visual cortex for interpretation and perception. For example, through fMRI, one can determine which parts of the brain are activated during sensory perception. In blind persons, it is seen that while they are only receiving tactile information, their visual cortex is also activated as they perceive sight objects.Bach-y-Rita P. Brain Mechanisms in Sensory Substitution, Academic Press New York:1972. Touch-to-touch sensory substitution is also possible, wherein information from touch receptors of one region of the body can be used to perceive touch in another region. For example, in one experiment by Bach-y- Rita,touch perception was able to be restored in a patient who lost peripheral sensation due to leprosy.Bach-y-Rita P. Nonsynaptic Diffusion Neurotransmission and Late Brain Reorganization, Demos-Vermande, New York :1995. =Technological support= In order to achieve sensory substitution and stimulate the brain without intact sensory organs to relay the information, machines can be used to do the signal transduction, rather than the sensory organs. This brain‚Äìmachine interface collects external signals and transforms them into electrical signals for the brain to interpret. Generally, a camera or a microphone is used to collect visual or auditory stimuli that are used to replace lost sight and hearing, respectively. The visual or auditory data collected from the sensors is transformed into tactile stimuli that are then relayed to the brain for visual and auditory perception. This and all types of sensory substitution are only possible due to neuroplasticity. =Brain plasticity= Brain plasticity refers to the brain's ability to adapt to a changing environment, for instance to the absence or deterioration of a sense. It is conceivable that cortical remapping or reorganization in response to the loss of one sense may be an evolutionary mechanism that allows people to adapt and compensate by using other senses better. Functional imaging of congenitally blind patients showed a cross-modal recruitment of the occipital cortex during perceptual tasks such as Braille reading, tactile perception, tactual object recognition, sound localization, and sound discrimination. This may suggest that blind people can use their occipital lobe, generally used for vision, to perceive objects through the use of other sensory modalities. This cross modal plasticity may explain the often described tendency of blind people to show enhanced ability in the other senses. =Perception versus sensing= While considering the physiological aspects of sensory substitution, it is essential to distinguish between sensing and perceiving. The general question posed by this differentiation is: Are blind people seeing or perceiving to see by putting together different sensory data? While sensation comes in one modality ‚Äì visual, auditory, tactile etc. ‚Äì perception due to sensory substitution is not one modality but a result of cross-modal interactions. It is therefore concluded that while sensory substitution for vision induces visual-like perception in sighted individuals, it induces auditory or tactile perception in blind individuals. In short, blind people perceive to see through touch and audition with sensory substitution. Different applications Applications are not restricted to handicapped persons, but also include artistic presentations, games, and augmented reality. Some examples are substitution of visual stimuli to audio or tactile, and of audio stimuli to tactile. Some of the most popular are probably Paul Bach-y-Rita's Tactile Vision Sensory Substitution (TVSS), developed with Carter Collins at Smith-Kettlewell Institute and Peter Meijer's Seeing with Sound approach (The vOICe). Technical developments, such as miniaturization and electrical stimulation help the advance of sensory substitution devices. In sensory substitution systems, we generally have sensors that collect the data from the external environment. This data is then relayed to a coupling system that interprets and transduces the information and then replays it to a stimulator. This stimulator ultimately stimulates a functioning sensory modality. After training, people learn to use the information gained from this stimulation to experience a perception of the sensation they lack instead of the actually stimulated sensation. For example, a leprosy patient, whose perception of peripheral touch was restored, was equipped with a glove containing artificial contact sensors coupled to skin sensory receptors on the forehead (which was stimulated). After training and acclimation, the patient was able to experience data from the glove as if it was originating in the fingertips while ignoring the sensations in the forehead. =Tactile systems= To understand tactile sensory substitution it is essential to understand some basic physiology of the tactile receptors of the skin. There are five basic types of tactile receptors: Pacinian corpuscle, Meissner's corpuscle, Ruffini endings, Merkel nerve endings, and free nerve endings. These receptors are mainly characterized by which type of stimuli best activates them, and by their rate of adaptation to sustained stimuli. Because of the rapid adaptation of some of these receptors to sustained stimuli, those receptors require rapidly changing tactile stimulation systems in order to be optimally activated. Among all these mechanoreceptors Pacinian corpuscle offers the highest sensitivity to high frequency vibration starting from few 10s of Hz to a few kHz with the help of its specialized mechanotransduction mechanism. There have been two different types of stimulators: electrotactile or vibrotactile. Electrotactile stimulators use direct electrical stimulation of the nerve ending in the skin to initiate the action potentials; the sensation triggered, burn, itch, pain, pressure etc. depends on the stimulating voltage. Vibrotactile stimulators use pressure and the properties of the mechanoreceptors of the skin to initiate action potentials. There are advantages and disadvantages for both these stimulation systems. With the electrotactile stimulating systems a lot of factors affect the sensation triggered: stimulating voltage, current, waveform, electrode size, material, contact force, skin location, thickness and hydration. Electrotactile stimulation may involve the direct stimulation of the nerves (percutaneous), or through the skin (transcutaneous). Percutaneous application causes additional distress to the patient, and is a major disadvantage of this approach. Furthermore, stimulation of the skin without insertion leads to the need for high voltage stimulation because of the high impedance of the dry skin, unless the tongue is used as a receptor, which requires only about 3% as much voltage. See also Brainport This latter technique is undergoing clinical trials for various applications, and been approved for assistance to the blind in the UK. Alternatively, the roof of the mouth has been proposed as another area where low currents can be felt. Electrostatic arrays are explored as human-computer interaction devices for touch screens. These are based on a phenomenon called electrovibration, which allows microamperre-level currents to be felt as roughness on a surface. Vibrotactile systems use the properties of mechanoreceptors in the skin so they have fewer parameters that need to be monitored as compared to electrotactile stimulation. However, vibrotactile stimulation systems need to account for the rapid adaptation of the tactile sense. Another important aspect of tactile sensory substitution systems is the location of the tactile stimulation. Tactile receptors are abundant on the fingertips, face, and tongue while sparse on the back, legs and arms. It is essential to take into account the spatial resolution of the receptor as it has a major effect on the resolution of the sensory substitution. A high resolution pin-arrayed display is able to present spatial information via tactile symbols, such as city maps and obstacle maps. Below you can find some descriptions of current tactile substitution systems. Tactile‚Äìvisual One of the earliest and most well known form of sensory substitution devices was Paul Bach-y-Rita's TVSS that converted the image from a video camera into a tactile image and coupled it to the tactile receptors on the back of his blind subject. Recently, several new systems have been developed that interface the tactile image to tactile receptors on different areas of the body such as the on the chest, brow, fingertip, abdomen, and forehead. The tactile image is produced by hundreds of activators placed on the person. The activators are solenoids of one millimeter diameter. In experiments, blind (or blindfolded) subjects equipped with the TVSS can learn to detect shapes and to orient themselves. In the case of simple geometric shapes, it took around 50 trials to achieve 100 percent correct recognition. To identify objects in different orientations requires several hours of learning. A system using the tongue as the human-machine interface is most practical. The tongue-machine interface is both protected by the closed mouth and the saliva in the mouth provides a good electrolytic environment that ensures good electrode contact. Results from a study by Bach-y-Rita et al. show that electrotactile stimulation of the tongue required 3% of the voltage required to stimulate the finger. Also, since it is more practical to wear an orthodontic retainer holding the stimulation system than an apparatus strapped to other parts of the body, the tongue-machine interface is more popular among TVSS systems. This tongue TVSS system works by delivering electrotactile stimuli to the dorsum of the tongue via a flexible electrode array placed in the mouth. This electrode array is connected to a Tongue Display Unit [TDU] via a ribbon cable passing out of the mouth. A video camera records a picture, transfers it to the TDU for conversion into a tactile image. The tactile image is then projected onto the tongue via the ribbon cable where the tongue's receptors pick up the signal. After training, subjects are able to associate certain types of stimuli to certain types of visual images.Bach-y-Rita P, and Kaczmarek KA. (2002). Tongue placed tactile output device. US Patent 6,430,450. In this way, tactile sensation can be used for visual perception. Sensory substitutions have also been successful with the emergence of wearable haptic actuators like vibrotactile motors, solenoids, peltier diodes, etc. At the Center for Cognitive Ubiquitous Computing at Arizona State University, researchers have developed technologies that enable people who are blind to perceive social situational information using wearable vibrotactile belts (Haptic Belt) and gloves (VibroGlove). Both technologies use miniature cameras that are mounted on a pair of glasses worn by the user who is blind. The Haptic Belt provides vibrations that convey the direction and distance at which a person is standing in front of a user, while the VibroGlove uses spatio-temporal mapping of vibration patterns to convey facial expressions of the interaction partner. Alternatively, it has been shown that even very simple cues indicating the presence or absence of obstacles (through small vibration modules located at strategic places in the body) can be useful for navigation, gait stabilization and reduced anxiety when evolving in an unknown space. This approach, called the \\"Haptic Radar\\" has been studied since 2005 by researchers at the University of Tokyo in collaboration with the University of Rio de Janeiro. Similar products include the Eyeronman vest and belt, and the forehead retina system. Tactile‚Äìauditory Neuroscientist David Eagleman presented a new device for sound-to-touch hearing at TED in 2015;Eagleman, David (2015). Can we create new senses for humans? TED talks. his laboratory research then expanded into a company based in Palo Alto, California, called Neosensory.Neosensory, Inc Neosensory devices capture sound and turn them into high-dimensional patterns of touch on the skin.Could This Futuristic Vest Give Us a Sixth Sense?, Smithsonian Magazine, Apr 2018.Meet the man who wants to give humans a sixth sense, The Telegraph, Jan 2019. Experiments by Schurmann et al. show that tactile senses can activate the human auditory cortex. Currently vibrotactile stimuli can be used to facilitate hearing in normal and hearing-impaired people. To test for the auditory areas activated by touch, Schurmann et al. tested subjects while stimulating their fingers and palms with vibration bursts and their fingertips with tactile pressure. They found that tactile stimulation of the fingers lead to activation of the auditory belt area, which suggests that there is a relationship between audition and tactition. Therefore, future research can be done to investigate the likelihood of a tactile‚Äìauditory sensory substitution system. One promising invention is the 'Sense organs synthesizer' which aims at delivering a normal hearing range of nine octaves via 216 electrodes to sequential touch nerve zones, next to the spine. Tactile‚Äìvestibular Some people with balance disorders or adverse reactions to antibiotics suffer from bilateral vestibular damage (BVD). They experience difficulty maintaining posture, unstable gait, and oscillopsia. Tyler et al. studied the restitution of postural control through a tactile for vestibular sensory substitution. Because BVD patients cannot integrate visual and tactile cues, they have a lot of difficulty standing. Using a head-mounted accelerometer and a brain-machine interface that employs electrotactile stimulation on the tongue, information about head- body orientation was relayed to the patient so that a new source of data is available to orient themselves and maintain good posture. Tactile‚Äìtactile to restore peripheral sensation Touch to touch sensory substitution is where information from touch receptors of one region can be used to perceive touch in another. For example, in one experiment by Bach-y-Rita, the touch perception was restored in a patient who lost peripheral sensation from leprosy. For example, this leprosy patient was equipped with a glove containing artificial contact sensors coupled to skin sensory receptors on the forehead (which was stimulated). After training and acclimation, the patient was able to experience data from the glove as if it was originating in the fingertips while ignoring the sensations in the forehead. After two days of training one of the leprosy subjects reported \\"the wonderful sensation of touching his wife, which he had been unable to experience for 20 years.\\" Tactile feedback system for prosthetic limbs The development of new technologies has now made it plausible to provide patients with prosthetic arms with tactile and kinesthetic sensibilities. While this is not purely a sensory substitution system, it uses the same principles to restore perception of senses. Some tactile feedback methods of restoring a perception of touch to amputees would be direct or micro stimulation of the tactile nerve afferents. Other applications of sensory substitution systems can be seen in function robotic prostheses for patients with high level quadriplegia. These robotic arms have several mechanisms of slip detection, vibration and texture detection that they relay to the patient through feedback. After more research and development, the information from these arms can be used by patients to perceive that they are holding and manipulating objects while their robotic arm actually accomplishes the task. =Auditory systems= Auditory sensory substitution systems like the tactile sensory substitution systems aim to use one sensory modality to compensate for the lack of another in order to gain a perception of one that is lacking. With auditory sensory substitution, visual or tactile sensors detect and store information about the external environment. This information is then transformed by interfaces into sound. Most systems are auditory-vision substitutions aimed at using the sense of hearing to convey visual information to the blind. The vOICe Auditory Display \\"The vOICe\\" converts live camera views from a video camera into soundscapes, patterns of scores of different tones at different volumes and pitches emitted simultaneously. The technology of the vOICe was invented in the 1990s by Peter Meijer and uses general video to audio mapping by associating height to pitch and brightness with loudness in a left-to-right scan of any video frame. EyeMusic The EyeMusic user wears a miniature camera connected to a small computer (or smartphone) and stereo headphones. The images are converted into \\"soundscapes\\". The high locations on the image are projected as high-pitched musical notes on a pentatonic scale, and low vertical locations as low-pitched musical notes. The EyeMusic conveys color information by using different musical instruments for each of the following five colors: white, blue, red, green, yellow. The EyeMusic employs an intermediate resolution of 30√ó50 pixels. LibreAudioView This project, presented in 2015, proposes a new versatile mobile device and a sonification method specifically designed to the pedestrian locomotion of the visually impaired. It sonifies in real-time spatial information from a video stream acquired at a standard frame rate. The device is composed of a miniature camera integrated into a glasses frame which is connected to a battery-powered minicomputer worn around the neck with a strap. The audio signal is transmitted to the user via running headphones. This system has two operating modes. With the first mode, when the user is static, only the edges of the moving objects are sonified. With the second mode, when the user is moving, the edges of both static and moving objects are sonified. Thus, the video stream is simplified by extracting only the edges of objects that can become dangerous obstacles. The system enables the localization of moving objects, the estimation of trajectories, and the detection of approaching objects. PSVA Another successful visual-to-auditory sensory substitution device is the Prosthesis Substituting Vision for Audition (PSVA). This system utilizes a head-mounted TV camera that allows real-time, online translation of visual patterns into sound. While the patient moves around, the device captures visual frames at a high frequency and generates the corresponding complex sounds that allow recognition. Visual stimuli are transduced into auditory stimuli with the use of a system that uses pixel to frequency relationship and couples a rough model of the human retina with an inverse model of the cochlea.  The Vibe  The sound produced by this software is a mixture of sinusoidal sounds produced by virtual \\"sources\\", corresponding each to a \\"receptive field\\" in the image. Each receptive field is a set of localized pixels. The sound's amplitude is determined by the mean luminosity of the pixels of the corresponding receptive field. The frequency and the inter-aural disparity are determined by the center of gravity of the co- ordinates of the receptive field's pixels in the image (see \\"There is something out there: distal attribution in sensory substitution, twenty years later\\"; Auvray M., Hanneton S., Lenay C., O'Regan K. Journal of Integrative Neuroscience 4 (2005) 505-21). The Vibe is an Open Source project hosted by Sourceforge. Other systems Other approaches to the substitution of hearing for vision use binaural directional cues, much as natural human echolocation does. An example of the latter approach is the \\"SeeHear\\" chip from Caltech.Nielson L, Mahowald M, Mead C (1989). \\"SeeHear,\\" in Analog VLSI and Neural Systems, by C. Mead, Reading: Addison-Wesley, chapter 13, 207‚Äì227. Other visual-auditory substitution devices deviate from the vOICe's greyscale mapping of images. Zach Capalbo's Kromophone uses a basic color spectrum correlating to different sounds and timbres to give users perceptual information beyond the vOICe's capabilities. =Nervous system implants= By means of stimulating electrodes implanted into the human nervous system, it is possible to apply current pulses to be learned and reliably recognized by the recipient. It has been shown successfully in experimentation, by Kevin Warwick, that signals can be employed from force/touch indicators on a robot hand as a means of communication. Criticism It has been argued that the term \\"substitution\\" is misleading, as it is merely an \\"addition\\" or \\"supplementation\\" not a substitution of a sensory modality. Sensory augmentation Building upon the research conducted on sensory substitution, investigations into the possibility of augmenting the body's sensory apparatus are now beginning. The intention is to extend the body's ability to sense aspects of the environment that are not normally perceivable by the body in its natural state. Active work in this direction is being conducted by, among others, the e-sense project of the Open University and Edinburgh University, and the feelSpace project of the University of Osnabr√ºck. The findings of research into sensory augmentation (as well as sensory substitution in general) that investigate the emergence of perceptual experience (qualia) from the activity of neurons have implications for the understanding of consciousness.

Thus they returned to the studio to capture this newfound energy. The resulting mini-album (Snakebite EP) features the cover song \\"Ain't No Love in the Heart of the City\\", originally performed by Bobby Bland.

In between, NY 13 intersects with Interstate 81 (I-81) in Cortland and Pulaski and meets the New York State Thruway (I-90) in Canastota. NY 13 is co-signed with several routes along its routing, most notably NY 34 and NY 96 between Newfield and Ithaca; NY 80 between DeRuyter and Cazenovia; and NY 5 between Chittenango and Canastota. The most heavily traveled section of the route is the northeast‚Äìsouthwest section between Horseheads and Cortland. Situated midway between the two locations is the city of Ithaca; here, a small section of NY 13 follows an expressway alignment around much of the city. Much of the route, however, is a two-lane highway that passes through rural areas. When NY 13 was originally assigned in the 1920s, it extended only from Elmira to Cazenovia. It was significantly extended in 1930, stretching from Lindley in the south to Richland in the north. The southern terminus was moved back to Elmira in the 1940s and has been located at various points in the city since then. Route description =Elmira to Ithaca= Up until 2006, NY 13 began at exit 54 on the Southern Tier Expressway (NY 17) southeast of the village of Horseheads. However, as part of the Horseheads Bypass project, NY 13 was extended west into the village to NY 14 along the frontage roads for the expressway. North of NY 17, NY 13 heads north through the town of Horseheads, paralleling the eastern edge of the village to an intersection with NY 223 near the northern town line. As NY 13 passes out of Horseheads and into Veteran, the amount of development along the roadway becomes sparse, consisting of only small roadside hamlets. A picture of NY13 near Ithaca was included on the Voyager Golden Record Just before exiting Chemung County, NY 13 turns northeast toward the city of Ithaca several miles to the northeast. The route soon enters the narrow southeastern extents of Schuyler County, where it intersects NY 224 before crossing county lines again, this time into Tompkins County. In the town of Newfield, NY 13 remains largely rural in nature, passing only one significant settlement‚Äîthe Newfield hamlet of the same name, officially known as Newfield Hamlet‚Äîon its way to the town of Ithaca. Shortly after entering the town, the route meets with the concurrent routes of NY 34 and NY 96 at an interchange adjacent to Robert H. Treman State Park, becoming Elmira Road. Both routes join NY 13 north alongside the eastern edge of the park to NY 327, a road largely delimiting the northern extent of the park. The three routes proceed generally northeastward through the town of Ithaca to the vicinity of Buttermilk Falls State Park, where they intersect the south end of NY 13A, an alternate route of NY 13 through western Ithaca, near the former Tutelo village of Coreogonel at the confluence of Buttermilk Creek and the Cayuga Lake inlet. NY 13, NY 34, and NY 96 continue on, directly serving Buttermilk Falls State Park as they pass over the creek and inlet and enter the Ithaca city limits. The history Dryden District School No. 5 is a one room schoolhouse just south of Route 13 in Dryden Township, Tompkins County. At West Clinton Street (NY 96B), the route splits into a one-way pair, with Meadow Street carrying northbound traffic and Fulton Street handling southbound traffic. Due to the configuration of the city street grid, NY 79 overlaps the three-route concurrency on Fulton Street for one block eastbound as it switches from West State Street to West Green Street; no such overlap exists westbound/northbound as NY 79 westbound remains on West Seneca Street, where NY 96 leaves NY 13/34 and joins NY 79\\\\. The one-way pair comes to an end near Hancock Street, at which point both directions of the route merge into Meadow Street and continue northeastward through the city as an at-grade roadway. At Dey Street, however, the road becomes a limited-access highway as it heads through the northern extents of the city and partially alongside Cayuga Lake. Near the northern city line, the roadway connects to East Shore Drive by way of an interchange, at which point NY 34 leaves the expressway to follow East Shore Drive along the lakeshore. NY 13 and NY 34 follow parallel routings into Lansing, where NY 13 curves eastward to interchange with both Cayuga Heights Road and Triphammer Road. Southwest of Ithaca Tompkins International Airport, NY 13 downgrades into a divided highway and meets Warren Road at-grade before reverting into a two-lane roadway as it passes south of the airport and exits the Ithaca area. =Ithaca to Lenox= Sign assembly for NY 13 in Cortland NY 13 progresses southeast through western Dryden to meet Dryden Road (NY 366), a street originating in eastern Ithaca. NY 366 joins NY 13 northeast along Fall Creek for little more than before splitting; however, the Dryden Road name remains with NY 13 into the village of Dryden. At the village center, NY 13 meets both NY 38 and NY 392\\\\. NY 13 turns north, overlapping NY 38 for three blocks and passing Tompkins Cortland Community College as it exits the village limits on Cortland Road. NY 13 southbound as it approaches downtown Cortland. At the Tompkins-Cortland County line, NY 13 loses the Cortland Road moniker and becomes unnamed as it heads toward Cortland. Southwest of the city limits, NY 13 breaks to the northeast, with its north-northeastward alignment continuing onward as NY 281\\\\. In Cortland, NY 13 becomes Tompkins Street and meets NY 215 (Owego Street) three blocks from an intersection with the overlapping routes of U.S. Route 11 (US 11) and NY 41 at Church Street. All three routes turn north onto Church, creating a three-route overlap that lasts for three blocks through downtown Cortland. At Clinton Road, US 11 and NY 41 turn west while NY 13 curves east for several blocks to an interchange with I-81 at the northeastern edge of the city's downtown district. Here, the Tioughnioga River splits, with NY 13 following the eastern branch northeast out of the Cortland city limits. NY 13 continues northeast along the banks of the Tioughnioga through Truxton, where it intersects the southern terminus of NY 91, to the hamlet of Cuyler in the town of the same name. Here, the river downgrades to a creek as the route turns eastward toward Madison County. Upon crossing the county line, NY 13 enters the village of DeRuyter, located in the town of the same name, as Cortland Street. In the village center, NY 13 turns left onto Utica Street and follows the roadway out of the village. Outside of the village, NY 13 follows a largely northeast‚Äìsouthwest alignment as it passes through the hamlet of Puckerville (centered around the junction between NY 13 and East Lake Road, a local roadway following the eastern edge of the DeRuyter Reservoir), to Sheds, a small hamlet marked by the intersection of NY 13 and NY 80\\\\. NY 13 turns north, overlapping NY 80 north for to the Cazenovia community of New Woodstock, where NY 13 leaves NY 80 at the western fringe of the hamlet. NY 13 heads north to the village of Cazenovia, located at the southeastern tip of Cazenovia Lake. Within the village limits, NY 13 overlaps US 20 on Forman and Albany Streets before continuing north out of the village on Farnham and Sweetland Streets. Outside of the village, the street becomes known as Gorge Road and enters a roughly ravine surrounding the Chittenango Creek. As NY 13 progresses northward, the gorge deepens, reaching approximately within Chittenango Falls State Park. North of the park, the gorge widens laterally and continues to drop in elevation, with the difference between the surrounding terrain and NY 13 reaching almost as it intersects NY 5 in southeastern Chittenango. The two routes overlap, following Genesee Street north for several blocks before turning east and paralleling the former Erie Canal out of the village. The two routes remain conjoined until Canastota, a village located in the town of Lenox, where NY 13 breaks from NY 5 and resumes its northward progression. North of the village center, NY 13 meets the New York State Thruway (I-90) at exit 34 before exiting Canastota. At the southeastern corner of Oneida Lake, NY 13 intersects NY 31\\\\. Just north of NY 31, NY 13 crosses over the Oneida River and enters Oneida County. =Oneida and Oswego counties= Between the county line and NY 49, NY 13 follows the eastern edge of Oneida Lake as it proceeds northward through the towns of Verona and Vienna. In Verona, NY 13 passes through the center of Verona Beach State Park and serves the lakeside community of Verona Beach, located adjacent to where the Erie Canal exits Oneida Lake. NY 13 crosses over the canal shortly afterward, passing into the Vienna community of Sylvan Beach in the process. Development along NY 13 continues as far north as Edgewater Beach, where NY 13 breaks from the lakeshore and continues north to meet NY 49\\\\. NY 13 turns east, overlapping NY 49 into the hamlet of Vienna. In the center of Vienna, NY 13 leaves NY 49 and continues northward through the hamlet of McConnellsville (where NY 13 is joined by the west branch of Fish Creek) to the village of Camden, where NY 69 overlaps NY 13 for two blocks through the heart of the village. Past Camden, NY 13 continues northwest along Fish Creek into the Oswego County town of Williamstown, where NY 13 leaves the waterway and intersects NY 183 and NY 104\\\\. NY 13 continues onward through rural central Oswego County to the village of Pulaski, which is in the town of Richland, where the route connects to southbound I-81 by way of a half- interchange just outside the village and intersects US 11 near the center of Pulaski. The route continues west for another before terminating at NY 3 in the hamlet of Port Ontario, which is also in the town of Richland. History Route 13 in downtown Horseheads =Early routing= When state highways in New York were first publicly signed in 1924, NY 13 was assigned only to the portion of its modern routing between Elmira and Cazenovia. Within the Elmira area, NY 13 initially followed a different routing, beginning at the intersection of Lake Street and Water Street (then NY 17) on the north bank of the Chemung River in downtown Elmira. The route then overlapped NY 14 along Lake Street to Horseheads, where NY 13 split from NY 14 and headed northeast on Old Ithaca Road to what is now the intersection between NY 13 and NY 223\\\\. Here, NY 13 turned north, following its current alignment toward Ithaca. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY 13 was extended over previously unnumbered roadways on both ends of its alignment, but unlike most routes in the state, it retained the same number along its original route. To the south, NY 13 was extended along Water Street (modern NY 352) to West Elmira, and on what is now NY 225 west to Caton. Past Caton, NY 13 continued west to NY 2 (now US 15) in Lindley by way of Tannery Creek Road, River Road, and Morgan Creek Road (collectively modern County Route 120). In the north, NY 13 was extended northward along its modern routing to NY 3C (modern NY 3) west of Pulaski.Automobile Legal Association (ALA) Automobile Green Book, 1930‚Äì31 and 1931‚Äì32 editions, (Scarborough Motor Guide Co., Boston, 1930 and 1931). The 1930‚Äì31 edition shows New York state routes prior to the 1930 renumbering By 1940, the portion of NY 13 between Horseheads and Elmira became part of a realigned NY 17. =Realignments and truncation= The portion of NY 13 west of Elmira was removed from the state highway system in the early 1940s. NY 13 was truncated back to its original terminus at Water Street in downtown Elmira even though all of NY 13 south of Horseheads was concurrent with NY 17. NY 17 was moved onto its current alignment east of the city in the late 1950s; NY 13 was realigned south of NY 223 to follow a new road leading to a newly constructed interchange with NY 17. In the mid-1980s, the Sullivanville Dam project forced a portion of the route to be rerouted northeast of Horseheads. Due to the elevated water level caused by the dam, the route had to be moved to higher ground west of the hamlet of Sullivanville in the Town of Veteran. A section of the old highway remains under the impounded water. Another section north of the dam exists as an extension of Sullivanville Road. In 2007, with the completion of the I-86 project, NY 13 was extended westward along the parallel collector/distributor roads to NY 14 in Horseheads. Prior to the project's completion, at least one \\"NY 13 south\\" sign assembly was exposed along the westbound frontage road leading from exit 54 (NY 13). Several similarly shaped signs on similar sign assemblies were covered along the route. =Routing through Ithaca= When NY 13 was first assigned, it entered the city of Ithaca on Spencer Road and followed Spencer and Cayuga Streets into downtown. From there, NY 13 proceeded generally northeastward on Court and Linn Streets, University Avenue, and Forest Home Drive through the Cornell University campus to Dryden Road, where it turned eastward toward Dryden. NY 13 was realigned to bypass the Cornell University grounds to the south on State (NY 79) and Mitchell Streets and Ithaca and Dryden Roads. Its old alignment through the college became NY 392. In the early 1960s, a new expressway was built along the eastern shore of Cayuga Lake, bypassing downtown Ithaca on the west and north. NY 13 was altered to follow Meadow Street and the freeway between southwestern Ithaca and the town of Dryden while the portion of NY 13's old routing that did not overlap NY 79 became an extension of NY 366. The new expressway was pictured on the Voyager Golden Record as an example of a \\"modern highway.\\" In 1996, ten blocks of southbound NY 13 was diverted from Meadow Street to Fulton Street as part of the Octopus elimination project. Major intersections NY 13A NY 13A is a north- south spur that bypasses downtown Ithaca by way of the town of Ithaca to the southwest. The route begins at NY 13, NY 34 and NY 96 south of the city and follows the west bank of Cayuga Inlet and the Ithaca Flood Control Channel north into the city, where it ends at NY 79 in Ithaca's West End, an area once dominated by squatters' villages. The highway is named Floral Avenue within the city and Five Mile Drive in the town of Ithaca, so named because it is five miles (8 km) from Cayuga Lake. NY 13A was assigned .

The manele can be divided into \\"classical manele\\" and \\"modern manele\\". The \\"classical manele\\" are a Turkish-derived genre performed by lƒÉutari in a lƒÉutƒÉreascƒÉ manner, while the \\"modern manele\\" are a mixture of Turkish, Greek, Arabic, Bulgarian and Serbian elements, generally using modern (electronic) instruments and beats. Similar music styles are also present in other Balkan areas, like Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro, Albania, Bosnia, Greece and Turkey and with expatriates and emigrants originally from these regions. Related genres are Bulgarian Chalga (manele brought by Romanian visitors to Bulgaria is referred to as \\"Romanian chalga\\"), Greek modern Skiladiko and Serbian Turbo-folk, each one being a mixture of local folk Greek, Bulgarian and Serbian influences over a pop tune. History Early references to the terms manea and manele appear in Romanian texts from the late 18th and early 19th century, during the period of Turkish suzerainty over the Romanian principalities, as a genre of dance music brought by Phanariotes from Istanbul.M. Manega, Cui ii e frica de manele? (\\"Who's afraid of manele\\") Jurnalul Na≈£ional This dance had no text. Some of these classical manele have been adapted during the ages. In the 1960s a type of lƒÉutareascƒÉ manea appeared, by adding texts to the geampara, a type of lƒÉutaresc genre of Turkish origin. The modern manele originated in the 1980s and early 1990s as underground translations and imitations of Turkish and Arabic songs. A well known Romanian manele singer, Adrian Copilul Minune traces it to a genre known as \\"turceasca\\" (Turkish), .D. Cobuz with A. Simionescu, Me≈üterul Manele (\\"The Manele Master\\"), Jurnalul Na≈£ional; in the same interview, Adrian Minune also claimed having featured in \\"hundreds of albums\\" and having composed \\"many, thousands...\\" of songs The genre has been rocked by accusations of plagiarism a number of times, with manele singers adapting popular songs from Greece, Bulgaria and Turkey, without giving due credit. The accusations increased especially after the hit \\"De ce mƒÉ min≈£i\\" (\\"Why are you lying to me?\\") proved to be a mere cover of Despina Vandi's song \\"M'agapas\\"/\\"Ah kardoula mou\\". Further plagiarism accusations surrounded a well known manele singer's track called \\"SupƒÉrat\\"(\\"Upset\\") which was proven by third parties to be plagiarized from a Croatian song (Umoran by Jasmin Stavros). Although this song was not technically a manea, it furthered the controversy surrounding this music genre and Romania's image. Most radio and television channels or media boycott manele music. Characteristics The difference between old and modern (contemporary) manea rhythmic pattern Manele is a mixture of \\"oriental\\" Romanian folk and contemporary pop music with bases on Balkan influences The lyrics usually refer to themes of love, enemies, money, alcoholism and difficulties of life in general, or some of the songs are specifically dedicated to parties, weddings, funerals, etc. Manele style contains objections to music primitiveness and low performance. Subject matter and style Manele are widely criticized for their lyrical content, which often consists of boasts about the singer's supposed sex appeal, intellect, wealth, social status, and superiority over so-called \\"enemies\\". Many singers use bad grammar, repetitive and simplistic rhymes suitable for chanting and are sometimes vulgar and/or misogynistic. Singers sometimes make trilling or yelling sounds during instrumental parts of their songs, an aspect that has been parodied many times. Some manele also have music videos, of which many are of poor quality while others are recorded in nightclubs or during private parties. Manele composers and players also use the term \\"oriental music\\" or \\"party music\\" for their creation, and consider their music a sub-genre of traditional, folk Roma music. Traditional Roma music is usually played on classical instruments by a live band (taraf) of lƒÉutari and has classical lyrics, while manele is usually sung by only one performer using modern instruments (generally synthesizers) as backup. Most manele are recorded in small recording studios, owned by the singer himself or by a group of singers, since major recording labels refuse to contract them. However, there are some exceptions: for example, Stana Izba≈üa and Nicu Paleru sing live, often with traditional instruments. Etymology and usage The word \\"manea\\" is of Turkish origin: m√¢ni is a form of Turkish folk song, in form of quatrains. The word \\"manea\\" is the singular form and it refers to the musical piece itself, as belonging to Manele genre. The accent is on the second syllable: man√©a. The plural version, more commonly used, manele, refers to: *the musical genre (e.g.: \\"I'm listening to manele.\\", in Romanian: \\"Ascult Manele.\\") *two or more manea songs (e.g.: \\"What are the latest manele (songs) you know?\\", in Romanian: \\"Care sunt cele mai noi manele pe care le stii?) The adjective form of the word is manelist, which is sometimes used in Romanian with a pejorative figurative form. Manele fashion Manelists have created a distinct image on the Romanian music scene, by showing their own fashion style. Many of the manelists use luxurious and casual, even underground styles combined altogether to form the specific manele fashion. Typical manele apparel includes flashy jewelry and affordable luxury clothing brands (such as Versace, Armani or Dolce & Gabbana) or certain sport brands (especially Nike). Such brands are an important part of manele culture, and they are even featured sometimes in lyrics. . Public opinion Manele are a strongly disputed genre in Romania, with many representatives of Romanian upper-middle and intellectual class opposing this \\"musical\\" movement (and its popularization) mostly because of its usage of faulty grammar, overly simplistic or childish lyrics and subject matter and/or encouragement of demeaning behaviours towards other people, as well as an antisocial overall message. The fact that manele lyrics are considered by many to be rude and of poor taste, coupled with widespread racist feelings against Roma ethnics (»öigani/Gypsies), who account for the bulk of manele performers, has led to increasing hostility between fans and opponents. This has generated frequent conflicts between the two, often in the form of internet flame wars. In the media, manele have been repeatedly called by journalists and academics (such as the literary critic George Pruteanu) \\"pseudo-music\\", \\"pure stupidity, inculture and blah-blah\\" or even \\"society's bed-wetter\\".D. Andronie, Este pi≈üoarca societƒÉ≈£ii (\\"It's society's bed-wetter\\"), Jurnalul Na≈£ional C. Tepercea, a National Audio-visual Board member who did a study on the genre for the board considered it \\"the genre for the mentally challenged\\" in an interview.D. Andronie with C. Tepercea, Fariseism ≈üi manelism (\\"Phariseeism and manelism\\"), Jurnalul Na≈£ional Even proposals to ban this type of music have been voiced. Romani-Romanian classical musician and politician MƒÉdƒÉlin Voicu distinguishes between the original genre and today's interpreters, calling their work \\"kitsch and bad taste\\", \\"bad merchandise, easy to sing, and only sold to fools at a high price\\", but considers them to be \\"harmful\\", \\"simple music and brain damaging\\", \\"a representation of the lack of musical culture in society\\" and \\"a fad that is poised to vanish in the future\\".C. Iancu, MarfƒÉ ieftinƒÉ, dar scumpƒÉ (\\"Cheap, but pricey commodity\\"), Jurnalul Na≈£ional. Romanian-American professor Cezar Giosan further compares the genre in an article in Dilema Veche with the early stages of rock-and-roll (and Elvis), early rap and reggaeton, music starting out from the outcast classes of society, being shunned by the higher classes for the simple reason of its origin, only to explode into mainstream later on.C. Giosan, Maneaua , Dilema Veche The same professor considers the genre as being a form of originality coming from below, with the singers having a genuine (albeit rough and uneducated) talent in music, with the lyrics being just a reflection of basic, simple human needs. In a similar vein, Sorin Adam Matei, an associate professor of communication at Purdue University, US, affirmed in an opinion piece for Evenimentul Zilei that manele are a creole genre, a simple, but lively music, spawned by the meeting of many cultures, that has a chance to succeed as a cultural style if it is polished and \\"cleaned up\\".Sorin Adam Matei, Rom√¢nia din Caraibe, Evenimentul Zilei. Both consider that manele is a valuable representation of Romanian popular culture, and would like it encouraged. Famous Romani-Romanian violin player Florin Niculescu said that manele singers are talented, but lack musical education. On Romanian television stations, manele performers and music are particularly seen on specialized manele television stations, such as Taraf TV or Manele TV. While mainstream radio stations do not air manele, a lot of smaller stations do, especially in Romania's capital, Bucharest. Occasionally, manele interpreters appear on New Year's Eve programs on television stations. Prohibition Manele have been prohibited in some cities of Romania in public transport, taxis or festivals.

It uses the same game engine as AM2's Virtua Fighter 2 but features enclosed arenas and an armor mechanic, and was targeted more towards Western audiences, using a U.S. setting and more freeform styles of martial arts. The game was released in the arcade in 1995 using the Sega Model 2 hardware, and became one of the highest grossing arcade games of 1996. The game was ported to the Sega Saturn, and to PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade in 2012. Though Fighting Vipers was not very popular in arcades, the Saturn version was one of the most high-profile games in the system's 1996 holiday lineup, and was met with positive reviews. Gameplay Fighting Vipers features a similar style of gameplay to Sega AM2's more renowned Virtua Fighter series, specifically Virtua Fighter 2, using simply guard, punch and kick attack buttons with a focus on combo moves. The Saturn version uses its three extra buttons for three smaller combos. Each of the 9 characters featured in the game wears armor that can be broken off by opponents, leaving them more vulnerable to taking damage. A human shaped meter in the top corners of the screen monitors damage to the armor. Walls surround each arena, caging the combatants in, allowing for attacks in conjunction with them (bouncing off etc.). If a knockout attack is strong enough, characters can knock their opponent over, on top, or straight through the walls. The Saturn port of Fighting Vipers added Playback Mode and Training Mode, both of which are now used widely in the genre, by games such as Tekken and Soulcalibur. Players could save their matches and play them again in Playback Mode, while Training Mode talked the player through the moves of each character one-by-one. Characters Bahn: despite only being a 17-year-old high school student from Nishino Machi, Bahn is a powerful and imposing fighter in a long coat and hat. He has come overseas to find and fight his father, whom he has never met and abandoned him and his mother when he was a boy. He has declared himself 'Gengis Bahn III'. Candy (or Honey): a petite 16-year-old fashion student with a pleasant nature, Candy designed her own trademark plastic fairy costume herself, and has entered the tournament to promote her original fashion line. Takara, a Japanese toy company, made three dolls of this character. Grace: a 19-year-old African-American born in Armstone City whose armor is themed after the protective gear for inline skating, including the skates themselves. Grace is making her living as a fashion model. Though she once dreamed of becoming a professional figure skater, her lover and coach betrayed her, leaving her disillusioned. Raxel: the narcissistic lead singer and guitarist for a hair metal band called 'Death Crunch' with KISS-styled armor and carrying a red Gibson Flying-V electric guitar, Raxel is the son of an Armstone City councilman, a drop out who left home after a fight with his father. Raxel has simply entered the tournament to heighten his own profile and become more famous. Tokio: a 16-year-old pretty boy rebelling against a strict kabuki actor's household. Tokio is a former leader of a street gang called 'Black Thunder' but left after feeling responsible for another gangmember's death. He has entered the tournament for a challenge and for thrills. Sanman: a mysterious fat man about whom nothing is known, other than his birthday (3 March) and an obsession with the number 3, hence his name (san is Japanese for \\"three\\"). Sanman drives a large customized scooter. Jane: a butch and muscled 18-year-old part-time construction worker, Jane trained her whole life to join the Navy, but did not make it past training. She was discharged after repeatedly losing control of herself during fights and injuring fellow seamen. Jane now wants to test just how tough she is, hence entering the Fighting Vipers tournament. Her design is heavily inspired by Private Vasquez from the film Aliens. Picky: a 14-year-old stereotypical skateboarder Picky's armour is styled after protective gear for skateboarders. He carries his skateboard on his back, and hits opponents with it. Picky began skateboarding to impress his first love, but later on he left her for Candy. Mahler: the unlockable ninth character, Mahler is a mysterious 20-year-old with a grudge against the Mayor of Armstone City (who has organised the tournament) wearing poisonous armor resembling a snake. He isn't officially registered as a member of the tournament. B.M.: the boss of the game and the man who organised the tournament, B.M. is a powered-up version of Mahler. Both Mahler and B.M.'s names may have been inspired by musician Samuel Coleridge-Taylor, who was known in America as the \\"Big Mahler\\". Kumachan: a 10-year-old smiling bear character wearing an orange hat, who is included as an unlockable character in the Sega Saturn port. It is based on the giant floating balloon mascot seen in the Old Armstone Town stage. It uses Sanman's fighting style, and its 2nd player counterpart is called Pandachan. Uniquely, even though it can fight, its 3D model never moves. Pepsiman: the Japanese mascot of Pepsi who only appears in the Japanese Sega Saturn version of the game as an unlockable character. He was removed from the US and PAL releases. Development Fighting Vipers was developed using the same game engine which was first used for Virtua Fighter 2, and uses a nearly identical arcade board, though with slightly faster processing speed. Unlike Virtua Fighter 2, there are no ring- outs; producer Yu Suzuki stated, \\"We received comments about the ring-outs in VF and so for FV the fighting can continue mercilessly.\\" The character Mahler was created by reducing the power specifications of the boss, B.M., so that he would be appropriately balanced for player vs. player matches. A demo of the game was displayed at the 1995 JAMMA show with all eight characters playable, though they did not yet have all their moves available. The Saturn conversion, like the arcade original, was developed by Sega AM2. The programming team consisted of 15 people, most of whom had worked on the Saturn version of Virtua Fighter 2, and some of whom had worked on the arcade version of Fighting Vipers. Work on the conversion began in the first quarter of 1996 and took eight months. After converting the Virtua Fighter 2 engine, the team focused first on recreating the barriers, as they anticipated this would be the most difficult part to accomplish on the Saturn hardware. Because armor and walls can be broken in the game, there was no easy way of reducing the number of polygons in those elements. In part to compensate for the lower polygon counts on the characters, a new form of dynamic lighting incorporating Gouraud shading was added to the Saturn version. In order to make this effect possible, and have the game run at a speed comparable to the arcade version, the team decided at the beginning of development that they would not use the Saturn's high-resolution mode. Regional differences *The original Japanese version had a large amount of advertising for Pepsi, due to product placement agreements with Sega at the time. This licensing was removed in the US and PAL versions. *In the US and PAL versions, Honey has been renamed as Candy. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed Fighting Vipers on their December 15, 1995 issue as being the most-successful arcade game of the year. Reviewing the arcade version, a Next Generation critic called Fighting Vipers \\"a beautiful, highly polished, polygon-rendered and texture-mapped game featuring brand new characters, unprecedented closed-in arenas (for a 3D fighter), a slightly different set of fighting strategies using armor, and a more cinematic style of viewing.\\" He also praised the more intuitive button combinations used to execute moves. Despite this, he concluded that the game fails to measure up to recent fighting games, chiefly due to the \\"strained\\" character designs: \\"Raxel, Jane, Picky, Sanman are undeniably trendy and conclusively uncool ... They lack the artful, graceful movements of VF2s Lau, Sarah, or Pai.\\" In reviews for the Saturn version, the barrier mechanics - allowing players to beat opponents against or through walls and use them to launch attacks - were met with universal approval. Most were also enthusiastic about being able to break off an opponent's armor for extra damage, though Crispin Boyer and Sushi-X of Electronic Gaming Monthly felt the amount of flesh exposed when a fighter's armor is broken off amounted to cheap lewdness. While some complained of reduced polygon counts and occasional slowdown compared to the arcade version, the conversion to the Saturn as a whole was well-regarded, with critics especially praising its retention of the arcade version's smooth animation, its use of light sourcing, and the Saturn- exclusive features. GameSpot concluded, \\"If you have a Saturn, this is the fighting game to own. If you don't, Fighting Vipers gives you a good reason to get one.\\" Scary Larry of GamePro said it \\"is one of our favorites because it's fast, sexy, and easy.\\" And while most critics felt that Fighting Vipers clearly falls short of Virtua Fighter 2, Rich Leadbetter of Sega Saturn Magazine said it \\"is far more of a gratifying experience to the average gamer than VF or its sequel\\" and a Next Generation reviewer concluded, \\"VF2 is one of the best games of all time, but Fighting Vipers nearly eclipses it.\\" Sequels and re-releases A sequel, Fighting Vipers 2 was released, introducing new characters. It was ported to the Dreamcast but only in Japan and Europe. All of the Fighting Vipers characters were used in Sega AM2's Fighters Megamix for the Sega Saturn. Fighting Vipers was also re-released for the PlayStation 2 as part of the Sega Ages line. A PAL version was planned, but never released. Fighting Vipers was re-released in late 2012 on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live as one of five games included in the Sega Model 2 Collection. The re-release features online play, but does not contain any of the extra content found in the Saturn version. Fighting Vipers is also included as a playable arcade game in Judgment. Bahn appears as a solo unit in Project X Zone, an 3DS' RPG crossover of Capcom, Sega and Namco Bandai Games. Sonic the Fighters A programmer working on Fighting Vipers put Sonic the Hedgehog and Tails in the game for amusement, which led to Sega AM2 commissioning a Sonic fighting game, Sonic the Fighters.The Last Arcade Crusaders Sega AM2 Interview from 1UP.com Hidden within the data of the arcade version of Sonic the Fighters is an additional character named Honey,\\"Honey\\".

A UNESCO World Heritage Site, it is the property of the Republic of Italy, and has been directed and run by the Polo Museale del Lazio since December 2014.  History  A model of Hadrian's Villa A plan of Hadrian's Villa The villa's recreation of Canopus, a resort near Alexandria, as seen from the temple of Serapis The villa was constructed at Tibur (modern- day Tivoli) as a retreat from Rome for Roman Emperor Hadrian during the second and third decades of the 2nd century AD. Hadrian is said to have disliked the palace on the Palatine Hill in Rome, leading to the construction of the retreat. It was traditional that the Roman emperor had constructed a villa as a place to relax from everyday life. Previous emperors and Romans with wealth, such as Trajan, had also constructed villas. Many villas were also self- sustaining with small farms and did not need to import food. The picturesque landscape around Tibur had made the area a popular choice for villas and rural retreats. It was reputedly popular with people from the Spanish peninsula who were residents in the city of Rome. This may have contributed to Hadrian's choice of the property ‚Äì although born in Rome, his parents came from Spain and he may have been familiar with the area during his early life. There may also have been a connection through his wife Vibia Sabina (83‚Äì136/137) who was the niece of the Emperor Trajan. Sabina's family held large landholdings and it is speculated the Tibur property may have been one of them. A villa from the Republican era formed the basis for Hadrian's establishment. During the later years of his reign, Hadrian actually governed the empire from the villa. Hadrian started using the villa as his official residence around AD 128. A large court therefore lived there permanently and large numbers of visitors and bureaucrats would have to have been entertained and temporarily housed on site. The postal service kept it in contact with Rome away, where the various government departments were located. It is unknown whether Hadrian's wife lived at the villa either on a temporary or permanent basis ‚Äì his relations with her were apparently rather strained or distant, possibly due to his ambiguous sexuality. Hadrian's parents had died when he was young, and he and his sister were adopted by Trajan. It is possible that Hadrian's court at the villa was predominately male but it is likely that his childhood nurse Germana, to whom he had formed a deep attachment, was probably accommodated there (she actually outlived him). After Hadrian, the villa was occasionally used by his various successors (busts of Antoninus Pius (138‚Äì161), Marcus Aurelius (161‚Äì180), Lucius Verus (161‚Äì169), Septimius Severus and Caracalla have been found on the premises). Zenobia, the deposed queen of Palmyra, possibly lived here in the 270s. During the decline of the Roman Empire in the 4th century, the villa gradually fell into disuse and was partially ruined as valuable statues and marble were taken away. The facility was used as a warehouse by both sides during the destructive Gothic War (535‚Äì554) between the Ostrogoths and Byzantines. Remains of lime kilns have been found, where marble from the complex was burned to extract lime for building material. Building material was also reused by the Christians to build basilicas and other buildings. In the 16th century, Cardinal Ippolito II d'Este had much of the remaining marble and statues in Hadrian's Villa removed to decorate his own Villa d'Este located nearby. Since that period excavations have sporadically turned up more fragments and sculptures, some of which have been kept in situ or housed on site in the display buildings.  Structure and architecture  Hadrian's Villa is a vast area of land with many pools, baths, fountains and classical Greek and Roman architecture set in what would have been a mixture of landscaped gardens, wilderness areas and cultivated farmlands. Due to Hadrian's travels, he also commissioned Egyptian style buildings and statues, even naming some of the buildings after Egyptian cities or temples. The buildings are constructed in travertine, brick, lime, pozzolana, and tufa. The complex contains over 30 buildings, covering at least a square kilometre (250 acres, an area larger than the city of Pompeii), of which much is still unexcavated. Villas were typically sited on hilltops, but with its fountains, pools and gardens, Hadrian's villa required abundant sources water, which was supplied by aqueducts feeding Rome, including the Aqua Anio Vetus, Aqua Anio Novus, Aqua Marcia, and Aqua Claudia. To avail themselves of those sources, the villa had to be located on land lower than the aqueduct.The ruins of Hadrian's Villa in their present state The complex of the villa contains many structures from different cultures. For example, the villa has a small Nile river running through it that relates back to the Egyptian Nile river. Also, the villa had Poikilos, which are Greek figures that were seen in ancient Greece. Within all the structures in the villa, there is also a grotto called Hades. All these structures relate back to where Emperor Hadrian visited during his reign. The architecture goes beyond the mere naming of its structures naming after places and monuments seen by Hadrian on his extensive travels across the empire. Certain buildings clearly attempt to recreate specific features of landscapes or architecture that had personal significance for the emperor. Thus, the area known as the Canopus, named after the Egyptian city where Antinous drowned, features a long, stately reflecting pool, representing the Nile, which was lined with copies of famous works of sculpture including the caryatids of the Erechtheion, a statue depicting the Egyptian dwarf and fertility god, Bes and a crocodile. The Pecile is modeled after the Stoa Poikile in Athens, a city favored by Hadrian. The structures freely mix traditional Greek and innovative Roman elements. The island enclosure (known as the Maritime Theatre) uses the classical Ionic order, albeit in a novel way; the triclinium of the so-called Piazza d‚ÄôOro and the Serapeum were covered with Roman segmented concrete domes, probably designed by Hadrian himself. Hadrian's Pecile located inside the Villa was a huge garden surrounded by a swimming pool and an arcade. The pool's dimensions measure . Originally, the pool was surrounded by four walls with colonnaded interior. These columns helped to support the roof. In the center of the quadriportico was a large rectangular pool. The four walls create a peaceful solitude for Hadrian and guests. One structure in the villa is the so-called \\"Maritime Theatre\\". It consists of a round portico with a barrel vault supported by pillars. Inside the portico was a ring-shaped pool with a central island. The large circular enclosure in diameter has an entrance to the north. Inside the outer wall and surrounding the moat are a ring of unfluted ionic columns. The Maritime Theater includes a lounge, a library, heated baths, three suites with heated floors, washbasin, an art gallery, and a large fountain. During the ancient times, the island was connected to the portico by two wooden drawbridges. On the island sits a small Roman house complete with an atrium, a library, a triclinium, and small baths. The area was probably used by the emperor as a retreat from the busy life at the court. The villa utilizes numerous architectural styles and innovations. The domes of the steam baths have circular holes on the apex to allow steam to escape. This is reminiscent of the Pantheon, also built by Hadrian. The area has a network of tunnels and were mostly used to transport servants and goods from one area to another. In 1998, the remains of what archaeologists claimed to be the monumental tomb of Antinous, or a temple to him, were discovered at the Villa.Mari, Zaccaria and Sgalambro, Sergio: The Antinoeion of Hadrian's Villa: Interpretation and Architectural Reconstruction, American Journal of Archaeology, Vol 3, No 1, Jan 2007. This, however, has subsequently been challenged in a study noting the lack of any direct evidence for a tomb of Antinous, as well as a previously overlooked patristic source indicating burial in Egypt at Antino√∂polis, and treating the possibility of a sanctuary of Antinous at Hadrian's Villa as plausible but unproven.Renberg, Gil H.: Hadrian and the Oracles of Antinous (SHA, Hadr. 14.7); with an appendix on the so-called Antinoeion at Hadrian‚Äôs Villa and Rome‚Äôs Monte Pincio Obelisk, Memoirs of the American Academy in Rome, Vol. 55 (2010) [2011], 159-198. Grand Thermae In September 2013, a network of tunnels was investigated, buried deep beneath the villa ‚Äì these were probably service routes for staff so that the idyllic nature of the landscape might remain undisturbed. The site housed several thousand people including staff, visitors, servants and slaves. Although much major activity would have been engaged in during Hadrian's absence on tours of inspection of the provinces a great many people (and animals) must have been moving about the Tivoli site on a daily basis. The almost constant building activity on top of basic gardening and domestic activities probably led to subterranean routes being resorted to. The villa itself has been described as an architectural masterpiece. A team of caving specialists has discovered that it is even more impressive than previously thought.

The mosaic now resides in the Altes Museumin Berlin, Germany. Many beautiful artifacts have been unearthed and restored at the Villa, such as marble statues of Antinous, Hadrian's deified lover, accidentally drowned in Egypt, and mosaics from the theatre and baths. A lifelike mosaic depicted a group of doves around a bowl, with one drinking, seems to be a copy of a work by Sosus of Pergamon as described by Pliny the Elder. It has in turn been widely copied. Many copies of Greek statues (such as the Wounded Amazon) have been found, and even Egyptian-style interpretations of Roman gods and vice versa. Most of these have been taken to Rome for preservation and restoration, and can be seen at the Musei Capitolini or the Musei Vaticani. However, many were also excavated in the 18th century by antiquities dealers such as Piranesi and Gavin Hamilton to sell to Grand Tourists and antiquarians such as Charles Towneley, and so are in major antiquities collections elsewhere in Europe and North America. Artworks found in the villa include: *Discobolus *Dove Basin mosaic, copy of a famous Hellenistic mosaic, Capitoline Museums *Diana of Versailles, Louvre *Crouching Venus *Capitoline Antinous *Young Centaur and Old Centaur (Capitoline versions)  Present-day significance  The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) designated Hadrian's Villa as a World Heritage Site in 1999. The designation specified the boundaries of the site and created a buffer zone around it in which no new construction was permitted. In 2011, the communal government of Tivoli announced plans, later cancelled, to build a waste dump in the vicinity of the villa and approved the construction of public housing on 120,000 sq. meters within the buffer zone. At its 36th Annual Meeting, UNESCO formally addressed these encroachments on the site. While they commended the Italian government for its decision to abandon the construction of a waste dump in the Corcolle area, the committee requested the government ‚Äúto inform the World Heritage Centre in due time about any major development project planned in the buffer zone of the property, including the housing development at Comprensorio di Ponte Lucano, for which a Heritage Impact Assessment should be included, in accordance with Paragraph 172 of the Operational Guidelines, before any irreversible commitment is made.‚Äù UNESCO also requested ‚Äúthe State Party to submit . . . an updated report on the state of conservation of the property,‚Äù by February 2014, reflecting concerns over the deterioration of the exposed ruins.Decisions Adopted by the World Heritage Committee at its 36th Session (WHC-12/36.COM/19), St. Petersburg, 2012, pp. 117-118. The reasons for making the villa a World Heritage Site are: it is a masterpiece that brings together the material culture of the Mediterranean world, it inspired the Renaissance and baroque period, it inspires the modern world as well, and the villa is an exceptional survival of the early Roman Empire. In 2016, as part of the reorganization of the Ministero per i Beni e le Attivit√† Culturali, Hadrian's Villa, the neighboring Villa d‚ÄôEste and the Temple of Hercules in Tivoli were placed under the supervision of the newly-created Istituto Autonomo di Villa Adriana. The Accademia Adrianea di Architettura ed Archeologia1 issued a call for papers for a conference titled Designing the UNESCO Buffer Aobe. The Academy of the villa was placed on the 100 Most Endangered Sites 2006 list of the World Monuments Watch because of the rapid deterioration of the ruins. In 2019, UNESCO designated Hadrian's Villa as a site with special immunity from wartime activity due to its profound symbolic value. This added level of security prohibits U.N. members from attacking the site or using it for military purposes in the event of a war.

He played his entire career for both Leeds United and Arsenal, making a total of 668 league appearances and played at the highest level of English football in four separate decades. He was capped by both the England U21 and England B sides. Club career Lukic signed for Leeds United as a schoolboy. He made his debut for the Elland Road side in 1979 and went on to play 165 games for them. After making a transfer request, Lukic moved to Arsenal in July 1983 for ¬£75,000, as a long-term replacement for Pat Jennings. By the middle of the 1984‚Äì85 season he was the club's No. 1, and won the League Cup in 1987 and the Division One title in 1989. He was ever present in Arsenal's first team throughout seasons 1987‚Äì88, 1988‚Äì89 and 1989‚Äì90. Lukic played in the final game of the 1989 season, where Arsenal won the title in the last minute of the game against Liverpool, with Lukic starting the move which led to Michael Thomas's famous goal. In the summer of 1990 Arsenal manager George Graham signed David Seaman from Queens Park Rangers ‚Äì Seaman had been Lukic's understudy at Leeds. This outraged many Arsenal fans at the time, especially as Lukic was a fan favourite. On his departure, Graham commented \\"I still think John Lukic is one of the best keepers in the country; I just think David Seaman is the best\\".http://www.arsenal.com/history/graham-s-glory-years/george-graham- appointed-as-manager Having played 277 times for the Gunners, Lukic rejoined Leeds for ¬£1million, playing a further 265 times and winning a second League title in 1991‚Äì92 and a runners up medal in the League Cup in 1995‚Äì96. Lukic was displaced at Leeds by the signing of Nigel Martyn, and in 1996 he returned for a second spell at Arsenal. As deputy to David Seaman, he played 15 league games in 1996‚Äì97 as cover, but after the signing of Alex Manninger in 1997 he stepped down to No. 3. However, with Manninger injured, Lukic was on the bench for Arsenal's 2000 UEFA Cup Final loss to Galatasaray, earning him a runners- up medal. In 2000, after a series of injuries to the club's other 'keepers, he made a brief return to the first team, playing four times. The last of these four games, against Derby County, was a month shy of his 40th birthday; another one of these, a match against Lazio on 17 October 2000 made him, at the time, the oldest player ever to take part in a UEFA Champions League match. This has since been surpassed by Dany Verlinden, Alessandro Costacurta and Marco Ballotta. He retired in 2001 and now coaches part-time. He has won the league with two different clubs, a feat he shares with fellow professionals such as Nicolas Anelka, Eric Cantona, Carlos Tevez, Ashley Cole, and Kevin Richardson. He is one of possibly four players to have played in the top flight of English football in four separate decades, the other players to attain this achievement are Peter Shilton, Steve Ogrizovic and Stanley Matthews. International career Though Lukic played for England at youth and under-21 level, he never won a cap for the senior team. He was once considered for selection to the Yugoslav national side (due to his Yugoslavian parentage) in the late eighties but he declined the offer. Personal life Lukic was born in Chesterfield to Yugoslavian parents; an urban legend states that Lukic's mother survived the Munich air disaster while pregnant with him; this is untrue, as the crash happened in February 1958, more than two years before Lukic was born. There was a Mrs Lukiƒá on board the plane, who did survive (along with her young daughter) after being saved by Manchester United goalkeeper Harry Gregg. Lukic has a son, also called John and also a goalkeeper, who was a youth player on the books of Nottingham Forest until 2005 when he was snubbed a professional contract, however he signed professional terms with Grimsby Town in June 2005 to act as understudy to Steve Mildenhall for the 2005‚Äì06 season. However, he was released at the end of the season and briefly signed for Barnsley before disappearing from competitive football. Lukic now works as a freelance goalkeeping coach and tours the country as an after dinner speaker.

Founded in 1909 as the Garford Motor Truck Company, Superior is best known for constructing bodies for professional cars (hearses) and school buses. Following major downturns in both segments in the late 1970s, Superior was liquidated by its parent company in 1980. From 1925 to 1980, the company was based in Lima, Ohio. After its 1980 closure, the Superior name would live on through several other companies. The manufacturing of school buses would play a part of the formation of Mid Bus (acquired by Collins Industries in 2008) and the professional car operations would remain in Lima as part of Accubuilt. Garford Motor Truck Company (1909-1925) In 1909, the Garford Motor Truck Company was established in Elyria, Ohio, a small town 30 miles outside Cleveland. By June 1912, the company was awarded a lucrative contract with the United States Post Office. The first order called for 11 trucks, the following for 20 trucks, for a total of 31 trucks. \\"This is very significant of the practical efficiency of this most advanced commercial car.\\" The post office had experimented for two years \\"with practically every truck made.\\" They tried not only all the leading American trucks, but the foreign trucks, as well. The test resulted in the Garford being awarded first honors. The Garford proved to be the most practical truck under all conditions.

The company diversified, introducing a line of hearse and ambulance bodies (known as professional cars) and becoming a major producer of school bus bodies for the U.S. and Canada, as well as export markets. For its professional-car platforms, Superior signed an agreement with Studebaker, thus gaining instant access to some 3000 dealers and Studebaker's chassis engineering. The company had continuing success for several years, and on the strength of this arrangement, rose to a prominent position in the professional-car business. By 1930, Superior and Studebaker had the only complete line of professional cars in the North American market. In 1938, having achieved success and having established a dealer network of its own, Superior left the partnership with Studebaker and began building bodies on General Motors platforms. Superior Coach Company ambulance body on 1970 Pontiac Bonneville commercial chassis. Superior Coach Company (1940-1980) International Loadstar chassis In 1940 the company changed its name again, to Superior Coach Company. School bus bodies were built primarily on Chevrolet/GMC, Dodge, Ford, and International Harvester truck chassis. In 1951 the Lima facility was expanded and a new facility in Kosciusko, Mississippi was opened. =Sheller-Globe Corporation= In 1969 Superior was acquired by the Sheller-Globe Corporation, an industrial conglomerate and auto parts maker based in Toledo, Ohio. The 1977 model year saw a major downsizing in the Cadillac automobile chassis used for the professional car business. In addition to being smaller, Cadillac's commercial chassis was significantly more expensive. Superior and other ambulance and funeral car manufacturers had to design new bodies and retool their factories, resulting in much higher consumer costs. The ambulance sector switched to larger van-based vehicles or and truck chassis. 1977 also brought new Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards for school buses built after 1 April,Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards which increased both costs and engineering challenges. At the same time, a downturn in North American school bus purchase volumes began as the children of the Baby Boom generation completed their elementary and secondary educations. By 1980, Superior was one of the six major school bus body manufacturing companies in the United States, competing with Blue Bird, Carpenter, Thomas, Ward, and Wayne, as well as Gillig and Crown whose buses were primarily sold on the West Coast. Bidding competition for reduced volumes became devastating to profits and even liquidity; in 1979, Ward declared bankruptcy, reorganizing as AmTran the following year, which later became IC Bus. Faced with these challenges, school bus industry overcapacity, the loss of ambulance business in the professional car sector, and decreased sales of funeral coaches due to higher production and sales costs, Sheller-Globe liquidated its Superior Coach-related investments in late 1980, and portions of its assets were sold. Post-liquidation manufacturing businesses After Sheller-Globe announced the closure of its Lima bus and professional car manufacturing operations in 1980, several small businesses purchased portions of the assets, and carried on successfully with several product lines. =School buses= Although large school bus manufacturing was discontinued with the 1980 model year, Mid Bus‚Äîa new small business based in Lima organized by three former employees‚Äîresumed production of the smallest Superior school buses, beginning with a workforce of seven people. The business grew successfully, and after a move to a much larger facility at Bluffton, Ohio, it was acquired by Collins Industries in 1998. =Professional cars= In 1981 Superior's hearse business was sold to Tom Earnhart. Later that year, it was merged with the largest competitor, the S&S; Coach Company.Accubuilt History, undated , retrieved on 18 February 2009. This formed a new company, S&S;/Superior of Ohio, to oversee the further development of the two businesses. Manufacturing operations were consolidated at Superior's plant in Lima, which had been expanded 30 years earlier. 2010 Cadillac DTS stretch limo, built by Superior As of 2007, S&S;/Superior now operates as a division of Accubuilt, using the Superior Coach trade name for its line of funeral cars and specialty vehicles. Accubuilt's flagship facility was also the exclusive production plant for the W.P. Chrysler Executive Series 300, a longer-wheelbase version of the Chrysler 300. In late 2017 Accubuilt was purchased by Sean Myers, owner of Armbruster Stageway, and was once again named S&S;/Superior Coach Company.

The bus had been built only 9 days before the more stringent 1977 Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards would have required better collision protection of the fuel tank, a wider central aisle for better access to the emergency door, and other safety improvements. Although no legal determination of product liability was ever made, Sheller-Globe and Ford Motor Company each contributed substantially to the settlement funds for those injured and the families of those who were killed. As of 2010, the Carrollton bus disaster remained one of the two worst bus accidents in U.S. history. The accident and the legal battle afterward were recounted in a 1994 book by James S. Kuen.

Early life Konstantin Paustovsky was born in Moscow. His father, descendant of the Zaporozhian Cossacks, was a railroad statistician, and was ‚Äúan incurable romantic and Protestant‚Äù. His mother came from the family of a Polish intellectual. Konstantin grew up in Ukraine, partly in the countryside and partly in Kiev. He studied in ‚Äúthe First Imperial‚Äù classical Gymnasium of Kiev, where he was the classmate of Mikhail Bulgakov. When he was in the 6th grade his father left the family and he was forced to give private lessons in order to earn a living. In 1912 he entered the faculty of Natural History in University of Kiev. In 1914 he transferred to the Law faculty of the University of Moscow, but World War I interrupted his education. At first he worked as a trolley-man in Moscow, then as a paramedic in a hospital train. During 1915, his medical unit retreated all the way through Poland and Belarus. After two of his brothers died on the front line, he returned to his mother in Moscow but later left and wandered around, trying his hands at many jobs, initially working in the metallurgical factories in Yekaterinoslav (now: Dnipro, Ukraine) and Yuzovka (now: Donetsk, Ukraine). In 1916 he lived in Taganrog, where he worked at the Taganrog Boiler Factory (now: Krasny Kotelschchik). Later he joined a cooperative association of fishermen (artel) in Taganrog, where he started his first novel –†–æ–º–∞–Ω—Ç–∏–∫–∏ (\\"Romantiki\\", Romantics) which was published in 1935. The novel, whose content and feelings are reflected in its title, described what he had seen and felt in his youth. One of the heroes, the old Oscar, was an artist who resisted all of his life being forced to become a moneymaker. He returned to the main theme of Romantics, the destiny of an artist who strives to overcome his loneliness, and his experiences in Taranrog in later works, including –†–∞–∑–≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä –æ —Ä—ã–±–µ (‚ÄúRazgovor o ribe‚Äù, Conversation about the Fish), –ê–∑–æ–≤—Å–∫–æ–µ –ø–æ–¥–ø–æ–ª—å–µ (‚ÄúAzovskoe podpolie‚Äù, Azov Underground) and –ü–æ—Ä—Ç –≤ —Ç—Ä–∞–≤–µ (‚ÄúPort v trave‚Äù, Seaport in The Grass). Novels and poetry Paustovsky began writing while still in Gymnasium. His first works were imitative poetry but he restricted his writing to prose after Ivan Bunin wrote in a letter to him: \\"I think that your sphere, your real poetry, is prose. It is here, if you are determined enough, that I am sure you can achieve something significant.\\" His first stories to be published were ‚ÄúNa vode‚Äù (‚ÄúOn The Water‚Äù) and ‚ÄúChetvero‚Äù (‚ÄúThe Four‚Äù) in 1911 and 1912. During World War I, he wrote sketches of life at the front, one of which was published. His first book, Morskiye Nabroski (‚ÄúSea Sketches‚Äù), was published in 1925, but received little attention. This was followed by Minetoza in 1927, and the romantic novel Blistaiushie Oblaka (‚ÄúShining Clouds‚Äù) in 1929. His work of this period was influenced by Alexander Grin as well as the writers of the \\"Odessa school\\", (Isaac Babel, Valentin Kataev, and Yuri Olesha). In the 1930s, Paustovsky visited various constructions sites and wrote in praise of the industrial transformation of the country. To that period belong the novels Kara-Bugaz (1932) and Kolkhida (1934). Kara-Bugaz won particular praise. It is essentially a tale of adventure and exploration in the region around Kara-Bugaz Bay, where the air is mysteriously heavy. It begins in 1847 and moves to the Russian Civil War period when a group of Red Guards is abandoned to near-certain death on a desolate island. Some of them, though do survive and are rescued by an explorer and stay on to help in the exploration, development and study of the natural wealth of the region. Paustovsky continued to explore historical themes in Severnaya Povest (\\"Tale of the North\\", 1938). In this tale, after the anti-Tsarist Decembrist uprising in Saint Petersburg, a wounded officer who had taken part in the uprising and a sailor try to make it by foot across the ice to Sweden but are captured in a sequence of dramatic events. Years later, in Leningrad in the 1930s, the great-grandsons of the participants unexpectedly meet. In the late 1930s, Russian nature emerged as a central theme for Paustovsky, for example, in Letniye Dni (\\"Summer Days\\", 1937) and Meshcherskaya Storona (1939) in which he treats nature was a many-faceted splendor in which man can free himself from daily cares and regain his spiritual equilibrium. This focus on nature drew comparisons with Mikhail Prishvin. Prishvin himself wrote in his diary, \\"If I were not Prishvin, I would like to write like Paustovsky.\\" During World War II Paustovsky served as a war correspondent on the southern front. In 1943 he produced a screenplay for the Gorky Film Studio production of \\"Lermontov\\", directed by Albert Gendelshtein. Another work of note is Tale of the Woods (1948). This story opens in a remote forest in the 1890s, where Tchaikovsky is composing a symphony. The young daughter of a local forester often brings Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky berries. Half a century later, the daughter of this girl is a laboratory technician working in the local forest station. From 1948 until 1955, Paustovsky taught at the Maxim Gorky Literature Institute. He also edited literary collections including Literary Moscow (1956) and Pages from Tarusa, in which he sought to bring new writers to the public's attention and to publish writers suppressed during the Joseph Stalin years. Other major works include Snow, Crossing Ships (1928); The Black Sea (1936); and The Rainy Dawn (1946). Paustovsky was also the author of several plays and fairy tales, including \\"Steel Ring\\" and of Zolotaya Rosa \\"The Golden Rose\\" (1955), in which he discusses the process of literary creation. Autobiography Perhaps Paustovsky's most famous work is his autobiography ‚ÄúPovest o Zhizni‚Äù (‚ÄúStory of a Life‚Äù). It is not a strictly historical document but rather a long, lyrical tale focusing on the internal perceptions and poetic development of the writer. It has been called a \\"biography of the soul\\" rather than a biography of events. Nonetheless, it does provide a unique view of life in Russia during the turbulent years of World War I, the Russian Civil War and rise of the Soviets, all of which Paustovsky participated in. Nobel prize nomination Tombstone of Paustovsky in Tarusa In 1965, Paustovsky was nominated for a Nobel Prize for literature, the prize was awarded instead to Mikhail Sholokhov. In February 1966 he was one of the 25 prominent figures from science and the arts who signed a letter to the 23rd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, appealing against re-Stalinization in the wake of the Sinyavsky-Daniel trial. He died in Moscow on July 14, 1968.

The official Hebrew name, Gonen (), is mainly used in municipal publications. Katamon is derived from the Greek Œ∫Œ±œÑ·Ω∞ œÑ·ø∑ ŒºŒøŒΩŒ±œÉœÑŒ∑œÅŒØ·ø≥ (\\"by the monastery\\"). The neighborhood is built next to an old Greek Orthodox monastery, believed to be built on the home and the tomb of Simeon from the Gospel of Luke. The neighborhood was established in the early 1900s, shortly before World War I as a wealthy, predominantly Christian Arab neighborhood. During the 1947‚Äì48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine the local population fled the neighborhood and it was soon repopulated by Jewish refugees. Geography Givat Oranim, Katamon Katamon is bounded by the neighborhoods of Talbiya in the northeast, and the German Colony and Greek Colony to the southeast. The neighbourhood is bounded on its south side by Rachel Imenu street and Hizkiyahu Ha'Melech street (separating it from the Greek Colony), and on its east side by Kovshey Katamon street (separating it from Talbiya). These streets connect to Emek Refaim and Rehov ha-Palmach, respectively. During the British Mandate era, the neighborhood was divided into Upper Katamon and Lower Katamon.Kroyanker, 2002, p.195 =Street names= During the British Mandate era the streets of Katamon had no names, with the exception of two: \\"Katamon\\" street (today known as \\"Rachel Imenu\\" and \\"Hizkiyahu HaMelech\\") and \\"Jorden\\" street (today known as \\"Tel Hai\\" street) which was nicknamed \\"Michael Sansour\\" street, who was a wealthy contractor whose house was in the street. The buildings were not numbered and were named after the families who built them. After Israel's independence names were given to the roads based on subjects such as the 1948 war, biblical characters and Zionist figures.Kroyanker, 2002, p.177-178 History =Antiquity= From the late 14th century, the location of Katamon seem to have been identified with the home of Simeon from the Gospel of Luke,Pringle, 1998, pp.166‚Äì167 the Jerusalemite who first recognised the infant Jesus as \\"the Lord's Christ\\", i.e. the promised Messiah (). =Ottoman era= St.Simeon belltower In 1524, after the Ottoman Turks conquered the region from the Mamluks, it was reported that a church of St Simeon, previously held by the Georgians, was now empty in the wake of Muslim attacks. In 1681 Cornelis de Bruijn made an engraving of Jerusalem, which suggested that there was an L-shaped, four-story-high tower in Katamon, confirming an early 17th-century source which mentioned a \\"house and tower\\" of \\"Simeon the prophet\\". The Greek Orthodox acquired the site in 1859 and in 1881 they built there a new church and residence for their Patriarch, incorporating the older ruins. The Greek Orthodox call it \\"St. Symeon of Katamonas\\" and believe that it is built over the tomb of Simeon, with an inscription in a cave on the grounds interpreted to indicate that it was the tomb of Simeon's priestly forefathers. In 1890 the Greek‚ÄìOrthodox patriarch Nicodemus I of Jerusalem built his summer house near the monastery (since the 1960s the building serves as a disabled care center).Kroyanker, 2002, p.264 The neighborhood began to develop in the late Ottoman Era, in the early 1900s. According to Israeli geographer Gideon Biger, Katamon was probably planned before World War I. The lands in Katamon, like in Talbiya and Baka, were owned by the Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem. In the late 19th century the church had a financial crisis which worsened during World War I. The Church sold, shortly before the war, some of its estate outside of the Old City, which were deemed as \\"less holy\\" including Katamon, which was split into plots for housing in a rural area.Kroyanker, 2002, pp.178‚Äì179 German aerial photographs taken during the war show building lots demarcated by stones at Katamon in a grid plan way, and a system of dirt roads.Kroyanker, 2002, p.178 Despite the low prices, the neighborhood did not attract Jewish buyers because the area was completely Christian, next to the Greek Colony, German Colony and Baka. Until the war five houses were built in Katamon. =British Mandate= Templer architecture in Katamon Katamon and its surroundings, 1947 During the 1920s, some 90 new residential plots were planned in Katamon and their construction began shortly after the war, especially after 1924. In a short time, some 40 luxurious buildings were built in the neighborhood, by Christian‚ÄìArab families. The buildings were built in plan for different blocs and not for the entire neighborhood. About half of Katamon's buildings were built between 1927 and 1937, and the rest were built until 1948. Most of Katamon's residents were mostly educators, teachers, businessmen, contractors, traders and other professionals from the upper and middle class.Kroyanker, 2002, p.181 Along with private houses, apartment buildings were built for the purpose of rent.Kroyanker, 2002, p.180 The neighborhood developed into a prosperous, bourgeois neighborhood with a European‚ÄìCosmopolitan character whilst retaining the local, oriental culture.Morris, 2004, p.123Kroyanker, 2002, p.180 Most of the builders were Arab‚ÄìChristians from the Greek‚ÄìOrthodox community, headed by Issa Michael al-Toubbeh, but among them were some Latin rite Catholics (some from an Italian origin) and Armenian Protestants. A phenomenon which contributed to the neighborhood's cosmopolitan character was intermarriage between different Christian communities.Kroyanker, 2002, p.183 The apartments were rented to Arab people and British officials, army officers and their families, who preferred to live in a Christian neighborhood. Most of the children were sent to high quality and expensive schools, usually private ones. The schools teaching languages were usually English, Italian, German or French. The members of the Greek‚ÄìOrthodox community lived a secular lifestyle, visiting churches only on holidays and family events. They used to pray in the church of the San Simon Monastery, the church of the Monastery of the Cross or in churches in the Christian Quarter of the Old City. The Latin rite Catholic community made their prayer at the Chapel of St. Theresa in Katamon or in churches located in the Old City. Protestant families conducted their prayer at the St. George's Cathedral or in the Old City. Many of the residents worked in British public services and many were members of YMCA. Many consulates were established in the neighborhood including the consulates of Lebanon, Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Italy (which remains the consulates of Italy in Israel today), Belgium, Poland and Czechoslovakia. Three small hotels and a pension existed in the neighborhood before 1948 and there was a British sports club in the neighborhood,Kroyanker, 2002, p.182 which was later used by Hapoel Jerusalem football club for a few years. =1948 War= File:Katamon 1948.jpgHarel Brigade during the attack on Katamon, 1948 File:Katamon during Yevusi.jpgBuilding in Katamon after Operation Yevusi April 1948 File:Katamon April 1948.jpgKatamon during Operation Yevusi File:Katamon after Operation Yevusi.jpgKatamon after Operation Yevusi File:Katamon destruction.jpgKatamon after Operation Yevusi During the 1947‚Äì1948 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine Katamon was largely abandoned by its residents. The evacuation of Arabs was reported already on 10 December, and British assistance to the evacuation was reported on the beginning of January. The neighbourhood's handful of Jewish inhabitants left during the war's first weeks. According to Israeli historian Benny Morris, they left either out of fear or under Arab intimidation. The neighborhood was an Arab neighborhood between two Jewish neighborhoods and the only one in a line of Jewish neighborhoods. On the night of 5‚Äì6 January 1948, the Haganah bombed the Semiramis Hotel in Katamon, killing 24 or 26 people. According to Benny Morris The Haganah believed that several irregulars' commanders lived there and, possibly mistakenly, that the hotel served as the neighbourhood militia headquarters. After the attack many Arab residents of the neighborhood began fleeing,Gelber 2004, p.141 most of them were women, children and elders. Most fled to the Old City and some fled to the southern part of Qatamon which was around the Iraqi consulate defended by the Jordanian Arab Legion. Some of the middle-class residents found refuge in Bethlehem.Gelber, 2004, p.244 The Arab authorities tried to stem the flight and many young men who fled to the Old City returned to Qatamon.Morris, 2004, p.124 Hala al-Sakakini, the daughter of Palestinian scholar and poet Khalil al-Sakakini and a resident of Katamon, described in her diary how frightened residents fled their homes and did not respond to the orders to remain.Hala al-Sakaini, Jerusalem and I: A Personal Record, Jordan 1990, p.111 By March only a few families remained in the neighborhood, guarded by irregular forces based on San Simon Monastery. During the war, attacks by the Arab side originated from the Greek Orthodox Saint Simeon Monastery in Katamon that was located in a strategic point overlooking the Jewish neighborhoods. On mid April the Jewish leadership halted Operation Harel near Jerusalem and ordered the Harel Brigade to deploy in the city and conduct Operation Yevusi. The reason behind the order was false reports of a fast British evacuation from the city and that the Arabs are deploying large forces in the city in order to fill the vacuum. In the battle over Katamon, which was centered around the St. Simeon monastery, most of the Arab fighters in the city participated, after they were called upon by the local militia. Fighters from the nearby Arab villages refused to send support, claiming they need to defend themselves. The commander of the Arab forces, Ibrahim Abu-Dayyeh(he), was one of the prominent Arab commanders and earned respect due to his involvement during the battle over the Nabi Daniel Convoy and the battle over Sheikh Jarrah. His men were equipped with light weapons and homemade armoured vehicles as well as ones looted from the battle of Nabi Daniel. Against them were the Jewish fighters of the fourth battalion of the Harel Brigade, who were exhausted from the constant fighting in earlier battles. During the fights both sides suffered from total exhaustion. The Arabs called on the Jordanian Arab Legion to intervene but they refused. When the Arabs saw no reinforcement will arrive they decided to halt their attack and withdrew, letting to Jews take the neighborhood.Gelber, 2004, p.126 Ofira Navon park, built on the site of Katamon football stadium The loss of the neighborhood was followed by massive looting by Jewish soldiers and civilians alike. Hagit Shlonsky, who lived nearby, wrote > For days you could see people walking by carrying looted goods. ... Not only > soldiers, civilians as well. They were looting like mad. They were even > carrying dining tables. Approximately 30,000 books, newspapers and manuscripts were collected by the National Library of Israel from Katamon and the other Arab neighborhoods. They were initially catalogued under their owners' names, but were later reclassified as \\"abandoned property\\". On September 17, 1948, UN Mediator Folke Bernadotte and UN Observer Andr√© Serot, were assassinated by members of the Jewish Lehi organisation while driving on Palmach Street in Katamon. =Resettlement after Israeli independence= Villa Cherkessi, Katamon During May‚ÄìJune, some 1,400 Jews, consisting of women, children, elders and woundedKroyanker, 2002, p.187 were expelled from the Jewish Quarter of the Old City by the Jordanian Arab Legion after it fell on 28 May. Some were settled in houses in Katamon, abandoned by its Arab owners.Gelber, 2004, p.282Morris, 2004, p.392 The neighborhood was also temporarily settled with Jewish women and children from front-line kibbutzim in the Jerusalem corridor. The abandoned neighborhood, as well as other evacuated Arab neighborhoods were looted by the displaced Jews and Israeli soldiers who entered empty Arab houses, a phenomenon that the Jewish authorities failed to halt, usually turning a blind eye to it.Gelber, 2004, p.172 This phenomenon was condemned by Israeli politician Dov Yosef, for ethical and moral reason, as well as practical reasons. The looters also took door and window frames, and taps, which made the relocation of refugees more difficult. Jewish immigrants and government officials joined the Old City's refugees and settled in Katamon after the war. In order to allow as many people to live in the neighborhood, the apartments were divided into smaller units. In buildings which housed one family, three or four new families were settled. Because of the difficulties, unauthorized renovations and improvised extensions made by the residents.Kroyanker, 2002, 188 Some of Katamon's buildings were designated for public needs, such as synagogues, schools, kindergartens and places for elders. One of the apartment buildings was used as a new location to the Misgav Ladach hospital, originally from the Old City. Architecture In the early 1950s, many public housing projects were built in Katamon, often using the Wild Bau cladding style - a random rubble masonry pattern - which was adopted by modernist architects in Jerusalem.Israel as a Modern Architectural Experimental Lab, 1948-1978, edited by Inbal Ben-Asher Gitler, Anat Geva Gentrification In the early 1970s, a process of gentrification began in Katamon when people of the middle class bought the apartments where low class residents lived and started renovating them, reuniting the apartments that were split after 1948 and overall raising the standards of the houses. Katamon attracted many people because of the character of its small \\"Arab styled\\" houses, with yards, stone walls and gates, porches, tiled roofs and stylized floors, located close to the city's center. The neighborhood had a slow process of population change and social and physical renewal. The conservative and semi-rural character attracted, mainly after the 1980s, families of Jewish immigrants, mostly wealthy religious ones from western countries, who were able to purchase and renovate the houses.Kroyanker, 2002, p.190 Since the 1970s, the neighborhood, which was populated mostly by secular and masorti Jews, has been having a process of Haredization, including the construction of apartment blocks for Haredi Jews.Kroyanker, 2002, p.192 Landmarks Misgav Ladach Hospital A major landmark in Katamon is the Saint Simeon monastery, known to Jerusalemites as San Simon(he), on a hilltop to the north. The monastery is now surrounded by a large park in the neighborhood known as Givat Oranim. In the center of the neighborhood lies the Recha Freier square. Around the square are five historical buildings that were used for the embassies and foreign consulates of Lebanon (during the British era only), Poland, Venezuela, El Salvador,Belgium and Greece. The Greek consulate remains there since the 1950s as the Greek consulate in Jerusalem.Kroyanker, 2002, pp. 198-206 Katamon is also home to the Israel Goldstein Youth Village(he), which has a number of school programs (boarding and day schools), especially for Russian and French Olim. Also in the Youth Village is Ramah Israel, which hosts teens from North America through the Ramah Seminar program for 6 weeks in the summer and Tichon Ramah Yerushalayim (Ramah Jerusalem High School) for 4.5 months in the Spring. Katamon was the home of several foreign consulates, among them the Greek consulate, the Italian consulate, and the Costa-Rican consulate.The discreet charm of the bourgeoisie The old Hapoel stadium was purchased by developers and is now the site of the upscale Ganei Katamon neighborhood, ringing Ofira Navon park. The Misgav Ladach hospital on the southern edge of the neighbourhood specialized in maternity care, but is now a Kupat Holim Meuhedet diagnostic center. The Museum for Islamic Art is located on Palmach Street in Katamon. Katamon also houses the core community of Erlau Hassidism, as well its yeshiva, Ohel Shimon. The International Christian Embassy Jerusalem has been based in Katamon since 1997. Katamonim Housing project, Katamon Tet To the west, Old Katamon branches out into several neighbourhoods collectively called the \\"Katamonim\\" (plural of Katamon; officially Gonenim, lit. \\"Defenders\\"), built in the early years of the state to accommodate the large wave of new immigrants, previously living in tent camps. These neighborhoods were assigned Hebrew numerals : Katamon Khet (\\"Katamon 8\\"), Katamon Tet (\\"Katamon 9), etc. Some of those neighborhoods have a second name. Katamon Hei (5) is also called San Simon Neighborhood, a part of Katamon Het (8) and Katamon tet (9) is sometimes called San Martin Neighborhood,◊û◊õ◊®◊ñ ◊©◊ú ◊®◊©◊ï◊™ ◊î◊ì◊ï◊ê◊® ◊ú◊°◊ï◊õ◊†◊ï◊™ ◊°◊ü ◊û◊®◊ò◊ô◊ü and Katamon zayn (7) is Pat neighborhood. Katamon Khet was built at the end of the 1950s, and Katamon Tet in the mid-1960s. The Katamonim are characterized by long apartment blocks on pillars, providing low-cost housing. Some of the buildings are still government-owned, although the Amidar housing company sold many of the apartments to the residents in the 1970s. The neighborhood hosts a well-known WIZO community center called after Helena Kagan. Prior to the Six-Day War in June 1967, the Katamonim were on the Jordanian-Israeli armistice line. Massive infrastructure improvement was financed by an urban renewal project known as \\"Project Renewal\\" over a period of two decades. Many small apartments were combined into larger ones and the outward appearance of the apartment blocks was improved. Since the 1990s, many Russian and Ethiopian immigrants have been given housing there. Sports The neighbourhood was home to the Hapoel Jerusalem football club from the 1930s until it moved back to the YMCA Stadium in the 1980s. In 2007, Hapoel Jerusalem fans formed a new club, naming it Hapoel Katamon Jerusalem after the club's former home, although the new club does not play in the neighborhood. The Jerusalem Tennis Center, founded in 1981 and dedicated in 1982 by the Jewish community of South Africa in memory of Yossi Zeituni, a tennis coach who fell in the Lebanon War, is located in the Katamonim. The center has 19 courts and a stadium with seating for 2,000 spectators. Trivia The 2008‚Äì2012 Israeli television drama Srugim takes place in Katamon.

Medication Treatments for the various forms of hair loss have only moderate success. Three medications have evidence to support their use in male pattern hair loss: finasteride, dutasteride and minoxidil. They typically work better to prevent further hair loss than to regrow lost hair. They may be used together when hair loss is progressive or further regrowth is desired after 12 months. Other medications include ketoconazole, and in female androgenic alopecia spironolactone and flutamide. Combinations of finasteride, minoxidil and ketoconazole are more effective than individual use. = Minoxidil = Minoxidil, applied topically, is widely used for the treatment of hair loss. It may be effective in helping promote hair growth in both men and women with androgenic alopecia. About 40% of men experience hair regrowth after 3‚Äì6 months. It is the only topical product that is FDA approved in America for androgenic hair loss. However, increased hair loss has been reported. =Antiandrogens= Finasteride is used to treat male pattern hair loss. Treatment provides about 30% improvement in hair loss after six months of treatment, and effectiveness only persists as long as the drug is taken. There is no good evidence for its use in women. It may cause gynecomastia, erectile dysfunction and depression. Dutasteride is used off label for male pattern hair loss. There is tentative support for spironolactone in women. Due to its feminising side effects and risk of infertility it is not often used by men. It can also cause low blood pressure, high blood potassium, and abnormal heart rhythms. Also, women who are pregnant or trying to become pregnant generally cannot use the medication as it is a teratogen, and can cause ambiguous genitalia in newborn children. There is tentative evidence for flutamide in women; however, it is associated with relatively high rates of liver problems. Like spironolactone, it is typically only used by women. =Ketoconazole= Ketoconazole may help in women. Surgical treatments =Hair transplantation= Hair transplantation is a surgical technique that moves individual hair follicles from a part of the body called the donor site to bald or balding part of the body known as the recipient site. It is primarily used to treat male pattern baldness. In this condition, grafts containing hair follicles that are genetically resistant to balding are transplanted to bald scalp. It is also used to restore eyelashes, eyebrows, beard hair, chest hair, and pubic hair and to fill in scars caused by accidents or surgery such as face-lifts and previous hair transplants. Hair transplantation differs from skin grafting in that grafts contain almost all of the epidermis and dermis surrounding the hair follicle, and many tiny grafts are transplanted rather than a single strip of skin. Since hair naturally grows in follicles in groups of 1 to 4 hairs, transplantation takes advantage of these naturally occurring follicular units. This achieves a more natural appearance by matching hair for hair through Follicular unit transplantation (FUT). Donor hair can be harvested in two different ways. Small grafts of naturally-occurring units of one to four hairs, called follicular units, can be moved to balding areas of the hair restoration. These follicular units are surgically implanted in the scalp in very close proximity to one another and in large numbers. The grafts are obtained in one or both of the two primary methods of surgical extraction, follicular unit transplantation, colloquially referred to as \\"strip harvesting\\", or Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE), in which follicles are transplanted individually. In FUT, a strip of skin containing many follicular units is extracted from the patient and dissected under a stereoscopic microscope. The site of the strip removal is stitched closed. Once divided into follicular unit grafts, each unit is individually inserted into small recipient sites made by an incision in the bald scalp. In the newer technique, roots are extracted from the donor area and divided into strips for transplantation. The strip, two to three millimeters thick, is isolated and transplanted to the bald scalp. After surgery, a bandage is worn for two days to protect the stitched strip during healing. A small strip scar remains after healing, which can be covered by scalp hair growing over the scar. =Scalp reduction= Scalp reduction is a surgical procedure in which the hairless region of the scalp of a bald man is reduced. This procedure can reduce the area of the scalp without hair. Radiation-induced hair loss Radiation induces hair loss through damage to hair follicle stem cell progenitors and alteration of keratin expression. Radiation therapy has been associated with increased mucin production in hair follicles. Studies have suggested electromagnetic radiation as a therapeutic growth stimulant in alopecia. Cosmeses There have been advances in the fashion industry in wig design. Certain hair shampoos and ointments visually thicken existing hair, without affecting the growth cycle. There have also been developments in the fashion industry with wig design. The fashion accessory has also been shown to be a source of psychological support for women undergoing chemotherapy, with cancer survivors in one study describing their wig as a \\"constant companion\\". Other studies in women have demonstrated a more mixed psychosocial impact of hairpiece use. Specialized tattoos, commonly known as scalp micropigmentation, can mimic the appearance of a short buzzed haircut. Alternative medicine Many people use unproven treatments, but there is little evidence of the effectiveness of vitamins, minerals, or other dietary supplements regrowing hair or retaining hair. =Laser therapy= 2008 and 2012 reviews found little evidence to support the use of special lights or lasers to treat hair loss. Both laser and lights appear to be safe. A 2014 and 2016 review found tentative evidence of benefit for lasers. While another 2014 review concluded that the results are mixed, have a high risk of bias, and that its effectiveness is unclear. =Dietary supplements= Dietary supplements are not typically recommended. There is only one small trial of saw palmetto which shows tentative benefit in those with mild to moderate androgenetic alopecia. There is no evidence for biotin. Evidence for most other products is also insufficient. There was no good evidence for gingko, aloe vera, ginseng, bergamot, or hibiscus as of 2011. While lacking both evidence and expert recommendation, there is a large market for hair growth supplements, especially for products that contain biotin. Mechanism Hair follicle with mesenchymal dermal papilla, labelled at top, location of hair follicle stem cells and thought to be site of action of DHT. Type 1 and 2 5Œ± reductase enzymes are present at pilosebaceous units in papillae of individual hair follicles. They catalyse formation of the androgens testosterone and DHT, which in turn regulate hair growth. Androgens have different effects at different follicles: they stimulate IGF-1 at facial hair, causing hair regrowth, but stimulate TGF Œ≤1, TGF Œ≤2, dickkopf1 and IL-6 at the scalp, causing hair follicle miniaturisation. Female androgenic alopecia is characterized by diffuse crown thinning without hairline recession, and like its male counterpart rarely leads to total hair loss. Finasteride and minoxidil are usually first line therapy for its treatment. Other options include topical or systemic spironolactone or flutamide, although they have a high incidence of feminising side effects and are better tolerated in female androgenic hair loss. More advanced cases may be resistant or unresponsive to medical therapy, however, and require hair transplantation. Naturally-occurring units of one to four hairs, called follicular units, are excised and moved to areas of hair restoration. These follicular units are surgically implanted in the scalp in close proximity and in large numbers. The grafts are obtained from either Follicular Unit Transplantation (FUT) ‚Äì colloquially referred to as \\"strip harvesting\\" ‚Äì or Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE). In the former, a strip of skin with follicular units is extracted and dissected into individual follicular unit grafts. The surgeon then implants the grafts into small incisions, called recipient sites. Specialized scalp tattoos can also mimic the appearance of a short buzzed haircut. Androgenic alopecia also occurs in women, and more often presents as diffuse thinning without hairline recession. Like its male counterpart, the condition rarely leads to total hair loss. Treatment options are similar to those for men, although topical or systemic estrogen is used more often. Research =Bimatoprost and latanoprost= Latanoprost and bimatoprost are specific PGF2a analogues applied topically, and have been found to lengthen eyelashes, darken hair pigmentation and elongate hair. Bimatoprost is available as treatment for eyelash growth. Latanoprost has shown ability to promote scalp hair density and pigmentation, and is theorized to function at the dermal papilla. A study found latanoprost ineffective on eyelashes in a patient with alopecia areata. It has also been found ineffective in treatment of eyebrow hair loss. =Hormones= Estrogens are indirect anti-androgens and can be used to treat androgenetic hair loss in women with oral contraceptives. Systemic estrogen increases SHBG, which binds androgens, including testosterone and DHT, in turn reducing their bioavailability. Topical formulations are available in Europe. Hair follicles have estrogen receptors and it is theorized that topical compounds act on them directly to promote hair growth and antagonize androgen action. Large clinical studies showing effectiveness are absent. Topical treatment is also usually unavailable in North America. There is tentative evidence for cyproterone acetate in women. =IGF-1= In December 2012, topical application of IGF-1 in a liposomal vehicle led to thicker and more rapid hair growth in transgenic mice with androgenic alopecia. The study did not show measurable systemic levels or hematopoietic side effects, suggesting potential for use in humans. Low energy radiofrequency irradiation induces IGF-1 in cultured human dermal papilla cells. Adenosine stimulates dermal papillae in vitro to induce IGF-1, along with fibroblast growth factors FGF7, FGF-2 and VEGF. Œ≤-catenin transcription increased, which promotes dermal papillae as well. Dietary isoflavones increase IGF production in scalp dermal papillae in transgenic mice. Topical capsaicin also stimulates IGF at hair follicles via release of vanilloid receptor-1, which in turn leads to more CGRP. Ascorbic acid has led to increased IGF expression in vitro. =Platelet-rich plasma= Reviews in 2013 and 2017 on the use of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) to regrow hair found insufficient evidence to draw clear conclusions. =Stem cell therapy= Although follicles were previously thought gone in areas of complete baldness, they are more likely dormant, as recent studies have shown the scalp contains the stem cells from which the follicles arose. Research on these follicular stem cells may lead to successes in treating baldness through hair multiplication (HM), also known as hair cloning. Per a May 2015 review, no successful strategy to generate human hair follicles, for hair regrowth, from adult stem cells has yet been reported. However, in April 2016, scientists from Japan published results of their work in which they created human skin from induced pluripotent stem cells; implanted into laboratory mice, the cells generated skin with hair and glands. =Genetics= From 2005 to 2007 Curis and Procter & Gamble collaborated on developing a topical hedgehog agonist for hair loss; the agent did not meet safety standards, and the program was terminated. In 2008 researchers at the University of Bonn announced they have found the genetic basis of two distinct forms of inherited hair loss. They found the gene P2RY5 causes a rare, inherited form of hair loss called hypotrichosis simplex. It is the first receptor in humans known to play a role in hair growth. Researchers found that disruption of the gene SOX21 in mice caused cyclical hair loss. Research has suggested SOX21 as a master regulator of hair shaft cuticle differentiation, with its disruption causing cyclical alopecia in mice models. Deletion of SOX21 dramatically affects hair lipids.

The racemes of flowers emerge from the center of the years new growth before it is mature, during spring and early summer. The flowers vary in color from white to purple, and all species have four pollinia. The tubers resemble a horn or claw. They are grayish-white or yellowish-white in appearance, with concentric rings and brown rootlets. They have a hard texture and do not break easily. Bletilla striata flower Bletilla ochracea flower Cultivation Bletilla species are generally hardy, though some need protection from severely cold frost. It is better to keep them in pots of well-drained media so that water does not sit around the roots during winter when the plants are not actively growing. They should also be watered sparingly at the start of the growing season as the new shoots emerge, as new roots often do not follow for around four weeks afterwards. Bletilla striata is the most common form found in the nursery trade and is often labeled simply as 'Hardy Orchid' or 'Chinese Ground Orchid' and is quite inexpensive. This beautiful and hardy deciduous orchid has the distinction of being one of the first orchids in cultivation in England dating from around 1794. The very flat knob-like tuberous root system is typically sympodial, expansive and each shoot is of annual duration only. On established plants, almost every new growth shoot has a flower spike before leaves fully develop. Each shoot can have up to fourteen beautiful rose-mauve flowers with a ruffled lip about 30mm diameter, scentless and looking something like a miniature Cattleya orchid flower. An established clump can have literally dozens of flower spikes flowering in the late Spring and the clumps only increase in beauty with time. They rarely exceed two feet in height. The flowers and leaves are at the mercy of late frosts, which are to be avoided if at all possible with coverings of a sheet or newspapers. Resist the temptation to remove the mulch layer even if the new growths are raising up the mulch due to an early Spring, unless no more frosts are likely. Unlike most tropical orchids, B. striata has attractive foliage even when not flowering. The pleated, tapered foliage looks very similar to the juvenile leaves of many palm species. A well established clump of these in flower is quite beautiful and they are surprisingly hardy even into USDA Zone 5 with a heavy mulch. They easily succeed in USDA Zone 6 with only a moderate mulch of straw or leaves. These hardiness ratings only apply to plants in the ground with the idea of preventing the actual root system from being frozen. If potted, they should be placed in a frost-free location if winter temperatures go below freezing. The plant is generally considered hardy without a mulch if minimum winter temperatures do not go below 25 ¬∞F. They have a great reputation of being the absolute easiest orchid for a beginner to grow. Unlike most tropical epiphytic orchids, this plant comes from somewhat temperate zones and grows in soil rather than on trees and require no extraordinary care to grow successfully. They prefer well drained evenly moist soils that are high in organic material and that never dry out nor remain sodden. They are sympodial growers and will form handsome clumps in only a few years. Other species and hybrids are occasionally available, the most common being B. striata var. alba, a white variation of the rose-mauve B. striata. Bletilla ochracea, a somewhat rare species from China has unusual flowers with yellow sepals and petals with a red-marked white lip and is becoming more available to collectors. Bletilla Penway Dragon (formosana √ó szetschuaunica) appears to be one of the exciting new hybrid grex if it becomes more available.

He wrote plays, social criticism, and histories of the ancient Russian social order.Russia and Western Civilization: Cultural and Historical Encounters By Russell Bova His father Sergey Aksakov and his sister Vera Aksakova were writers, and his younger brother, Ivan Aksakov, was a journalist. Konstantin was the first to publish an analysis of Gogol's Dead Souls, comparing the Russian author with Homer (1842). After Tsar Alexander II's accession to the throne, he sent him a letter advising to restore the zemsky sobor (1855). Aksakov also penned a number of articles on Slavonic linguistics. Personal life Aksakov was born into a family of prominent Russian writer Sergey Timofeevich Aksakov (1791‚Äî1859) and his wife Olga Semyonovna Zaplatina (1793‚Äî1878). His paternal grandfather Timofey Stepanovich Aksakov belonged to an old noble Aksakov family whose members claimed to be the decedents of ≈†imon. Their first documented ancestor was Ivan Feodorivich Velyaminov nicknamed Oksak who lived during the 15th century. His family crest was based on the Polish Przyjaciel coat of arms (also known as Aksak) which is considered to be of Tatar origin in Poland (the word ¬´oksak¬ª means ¬´lame¬ª in Turkic languages).Andrei Kuleshov (2009).

Generation XXV. ‚Äî Moscow: Territory at the official Aksakov family website (in Russian) Aksakov was raised on a country estate before he moved to Moscow with his family. He remained with his parents his entire life, without ever marrying or moving out of the house. He studied at Moscow State University, and he became a member of the Stankevitch Circle, a group of Russian Hegelians and early believers of Russian democracy. Aksakov eventually made the acquaintance of Ivan Kireyevsky and Aleksey Khomyakov, adopted their philosophy of Slavophilism and broke off all contact with the Stankevitch Circle. Philosophy Aksakov's thesis on Mikhail Lomonosov (1846) attempted to synthesize his view of the Russian peasant's religious and historical mission with Hegel's philosophy. Aksakov had influenced Alexander III, giving him his radical understanding that the \\"mission of autocracy in Russia is to give a certain well-being to the peasants.\\" Later in his career, Aksakov abandoned Hegelian philosophy and became radically anti-European.Everything2.com See also * List of 19th- century Russian Slavophiles References Bibliography * Category:1817 births Category:1860 deaths Category:People from Buguruslansky District Category:People from Orenburg Governorate Category:Slavophiles Category:19th- century Russian philosophers Category:Imperial Moscow University alumni Category:Russian nationalists Category:19th-century deaths from tuberculosis Category:19th-century Russian writers Category:Tuberculosis deaths in Greece ","title":"Konstantin Aksakov"},{"id":"1903976","text":"Another Roadside Attraction was a travelling music-and-arts summer festival in Canada in the 1990s.\\"Forget h.o.r.d.e., Lilith Fair and Lollapalooza, Another Roadside Attraction is the best touring festival on the continent\\".

The story chronicles the history of gun culture, gun rights, and gun control in the United States from the early 20th century through the late 1990s. Although clearly a work of fiction, the story is heavily laced with historical fact, including historical figures who play minor supporting roles. The protagonist is very active in competitive shooting sports, as is the author; so unusually detailed and intricate facts, figures, and explanations of firearms-related topics ornament the narrative and drive the plot. The cover has a picture of Lady Justice being assaulted by an ATF agent. The book was listed by The New York Times' Sunday Book Review as one of the most sought after out-of-print books of 2013.  Background  The story hinges upon the enactment and subsequent unintended consequences of several important pieces of U.S. gun control legislation and regulation: the National Firearms Act of 1934, the Gun Control Act of 1968, the Firearm Owners Protection Act of 1986, the Assault Weapons Importation Ban enacted by Presidential executive order in 1989, and the Federal Assault Weapons Ban of 1994. Its thesis, as discussed in the ‚ÄúAuthor's Note ‚Äì A Warning and Disclaimer‚Äù in the beginning of the book, is that enough bullying, by what is widely perceived as a hostile occupation government, will inevitably end in revolt if the occupied area is large enough and has a culture that is significantly different from the occupying state, and that this revolt will be undefeatable if the rebels use very low-tech \\"leaderless resistance.\\" Characters Henry Bowman is the principal character, although the story begins in 1906, long before Bowman's birth on January 10, 1953. The story is told primarily from his perspective when he is in his early forties. Bowman grows up in the St. Louis, Missouri area, where much of the story takes place. He is a trained geologist, a self-taught expert marksman, a firearms, ammunition, and self-defense authority, and a pilot. Bowman lives on a rural acreage near the St. Louis, Missouri metropolitan area. There is an abandoned stone quarry on his land which Bowman uses for recreational shooting. Bowman, in the novel, enjoys owning performance automobiles and driving at high speed on interstate highways. In one part of the novel, he races his hot-rodded GMC truck against a rival Porsche, with Bowman winning, driving in excess of to win. Bowman also has several forged identities that he uses for various purposes in the novel. Bowman is a proficient skydiver. Walter \\"Blackout\\" Bowman is Henry's father. A skilled pilot and U.S. Navy officer, he trained 437 naval aviators during World War II, retiring as a Lieutenant Commander. He represents the studious, responsible, and thoughtful side of the younger Bowman. The author has stated that the elder Bowman is based on his own father. Max Collins is Bowman's uncle. He is portrayed as a larger-than-life character who is an expert marksman, professional gambler, and accomplished ladies' man. He served in the airborne troops of D-Day, and killed a German army officer in combat with his sniper rifle. In the novel, at a 1960s Nevada shooting competition, he bets on his nephew Henry's shooting, winning $10,000. He represents the adventurous, spontaneous, and aggressive side of the younger Henry Bowman. The author has stated that Collins is based on his own uncle. Irwin Mann is a survivor of The Holocaust and the Warsaw Ghetto, and a key participant in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. His inclusion in the story permits a study of the use of firearms by average citizens to repel an oppressive government and connects Nazi gun control measures to American gun control efforts. Ray Johnson is a New York City attorney, originally from Aspen, Colorado, who moves to Africa in 1963 and becomes a big-game safari guide. His return to the U.S. in 1994 serves to illustrate how much U.S. gun owners' freedoms have eroded, due to legislation and an executive order enacted during his absence. At the airport, Customs attempts to confiscate an English double rifle worth some US$40,000, a Belgian FN FAL semi-automatic rifle, a Smith & Wesson 2\\" Chief's Special revolver, and his hat which has a leopard skin hat band. Ray calls his friend Henry, and Henry calls in a favor with a friend who is a high-ranking Customs official. Ray is allowed to keep his firearms and enter the United States. Allen Kane is a major machine gun dealer who is Henry's lifelong friend. A major shift in the novel's plot occurs when Henry finds corrupt ATF agents framing Allen, himself, and another firearms dealer. Allen aids and accompanies Henry in much of the novel. Cindy Caswell is a victim of childhood abuse and organized crime who becomes important in the freedom struggle as it develops. She is from Rolla, Missouri. She is abducted by mafia thugs during a trip to Chicago, Illinois, who force her to become a sex slave for mafia bosses and leaders. After several years, she escapes and meets Henry Bowman at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. She assassinates many pro-gun control and big-government politicians and legislators in the novel. The author has been criticized for creating an \\"adolescent fantasy\\" with this character. Ten years after writing the novel, Ross met Tammy Chapman, whose early life shares a resemblance to that of the fictional Caswell. Ross and Chapman now live together in St. Louis.Author's website Plot The novel's protagonist, Henry Bowman, shows an early proficiency with firearms, practicing whenever he can find the time. Encouraged by his father, he gathers an impressive firearms collection and gains extensive experience in piloting small aircraft. During college, Bowman is robbed, beaten, and sodomized by a rural gang. The incident nearly destroys him and causes him to become an alcoholic for a period. While at a gun show in Indianapolis, Indiana with friend Allen Kane, Bowman publicly embarrasses an agent of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), Wilson Blair. One of Blair's men was trying to trick and entrap a fellow firearms dealer. Blair takes the offense personally, and with the support of the ATF's director, begins to plan revenge. Several years later, Blair and subordinate agents of the ATF plan to frame Henry and his friends as terrorists, smugglers, and counterfeiters. They plan to plant \\"evidence\\" when the men are away on vacation. Unbeknownst to Blair, Bowman delays his departure at the last minute due to a work commitment, and is on a friend's property when the agents arrive. Bowman assumes the agents are burglars and engages in a gun battle with them, killing or capturing all and in the process discovering the truth about the raid. Bowman realizes that his life has been irrevocably changed. He makes Blair record a video taped confession of his illegal actions, kills Blair, and disposes of all forensic evidence of the agents' presence. Afterwards, he hunts down and kills Blair's remaining subordinates. Bowman and his closest friends begin to systematically kill ATF agents around the nation ‚Äì whom Bowman views as supporting the infringement of citizen's constitutional rights, and abusing government powers ‚Äì as well as politicians who had supported unconstitutional gun control legislation. Simultaneously Bowman releases the video tape of Blair to CNN, which claims that Blair and his companions have had a change of heart, realize what they are doing is wrong, and are now dedicated to killing other ATF agents. Amidst the national search for Blair and company, Bowman continues to rack up the body count. Eventually, as the ATF and FBI are unable to effectively track down those responsible for the killings, the President of the United States is forced to give an address to the nation relating his intent to repeal the unconstitutional laws, including the National Firearms Act of 1934 and Gun Control Act of 1968. = Fictionalized accounts of historical events = The story contains several items of historical fiction (accounts of real events with fictionalized thoughts & dialog) that are not widely known and advance the book's premise and plot.

History Before the present SR 19 was constructed, San Gabriel Boulevard, which extended from Lamanda Park south to Downey, and was widened and repaved by an assessment tax in 1925,Los Angeles Times, Celebrate Paving of Boulevard, November 4, 1925 was the main road through the Whittier Narrows, requiring several turns to stay on it and to continue south to Long Beach.Ben Blow, California Highways: A Descriptive Record of Road Development by the State and by Such Counties as Have Paved Highways, 1920 (Archive.org or Google Books), p. 165Rand McNally & Company, Los Angeles and Vicinity , 1933Division of Highways, Los Angeles and Vicinity, 1934 The state legislature added Route 168 to the state highway system in 1933, which followed this general alignment between Route 60 (SR 1) in Long Beach and Route 9 (Foothill Boulevard, then US 66) near Lamanda Park.: \\"State Highway Route 60 near Long Beach to State Highway Route 9 near Lamanda Park.\\": \\"Route 168 is from Route 60 near Long Beach to Route 9 near Lamanda Park.\\" SR 19 was designated out of the 1964 state highway renumbering. However, since then, many segments of SR 19 have been relinquished to the cities that they run through. Caltrans relinquished Long Beach's portion of SR 19 to the city on January 27, 1999, and Downey's segment of SR 19 was relinquished to the city on July 3, 2001. However, the segment in Pico Rivera was not relinquished to that city until June 22, 2004. On October 27, 2006, the northern portion of SR 164 that went through an unincorporated area of the county from Callita Street to I-210 was relinquished to the county. In April 2008, the section of SR 164 through Temple City was relinquished to that city. On April 9, 2012, the section of SR 19 through Lakewood was relinquished to that city. In 2017, the relinquishment process in Bellflower has started.

It is also called random telegraph noise (RTN), popcorn noise, impulse noise, bi-stable noise, or random telegraph signal (RTS) noise. It consists of sudden step-like transitions between two or more discrete voltage or current levels, as high as several hundred microvolts, at random and unpredictable times. Each shift in offset voltage or current often lasts from several milliseconds to seconds, and sounds like popcorn popping if hooked up to an audio speaker. Popcorn noise was first observed in early point contact diodes, then re-discovered during the commercialization of one of the first semiconductor op-amps; the 709. No single source of popcorn noise is theorized to explain all occurrences, however the most commonly invoked cause is the random trapping and release of charge carriers at thin film interfaces or at defect sites in bulk semiconductor crystal. In cases where these charges have a significant impact on transistor performance (such as under an MOS gate or in a bipolar base region), the output signal can be substantial. These defects can be caused by manufacturing processes, such as heavy ion implantation, or by unintentional side-effects such as surface contamination. Individual op-amps can be screened for popcorn noise with peak detector circuits, to minimize the amount of noise in a specific application. Burst noise is modeled mathematically by means of the telegraph process, a Markovian continuous-time stochastic process that jumps discontinuously between two distinct values.

There are two types of magnetosonic waves, the fast magnetosonic wave and the slow magnetosonic wave. Both fast and slow magnetosonic waves have been recently discovered in the solar corona, which created an observational foundation for the novel technique for the coronal plasma diagnostics, coronal seismology.  Homogeneous plasma  In an ideal homogeneous plasma of infinite extent, and in the absence of gravity, the magnetosonic waves form, together with the Alfv√©n wave, the three basic linear MHD waves. Under the assumption of normal modes, namely that the linear perturbations of the physical quantities are of the form f_1=\\\\tilde{f}_1 e^{i(k_x x + k_y y + k_z z - \\\\omega t)} (with \\\\tilde{f}_1 the constant amplitude), a dispersion relation of the magnetosonic waves can be derived from the system of ideal MHD equations: \\\\omega^4 - k^2 (v_s^2+v_A^2) \\\\omega^2 + k_{\\\\parallel} k^2 v_s^2v_A^2 = 0, where v_A is the Alfv√©n speed, v_s is the sound speed, k=\\\\sqrt{k_x^2+k_y^2+k_z^2} is the magnitude of the wave vector and k_\\\\parallel is the component of the wave vector along the background magnetic field (which is straight and constant, because the plasma is assumed homogeneous). This equation can be solved for the frequency \\\\omega, yielding the frequencies of the fast and slow magnetosonic waves: \\\\omega^2_{f, sl} = \\\\frac{k^2 (v_s^2+v_A^2)}{2} \\\\Biggl(1 \\\\pm \\\\biggl(1 - \\\\frac{4 k_{\\\\parallel}^2 v_s^2 v_A^2}{k^2(v_s^2+v_A^2)^2}\\\\biggr)^{1/2}\\\\Biggr). It can be shown that \\\\omega_{sl} \\\\leq \\\\omega_{A} \\\\leq \\\\omega_{f} (with \\\\omega_A = k_{\\\\parallel} v_A the Alfv√©n frequency), hence the name of \\"slow\\" and \\"fast\\" magnetosonic waves. = Limiting cases =  Absent magnetic field  In the absence of a magnetic field, the whole MHD model reduces to the hydrodynamics (HD) model. In this case v_A = 0, and hence \\\\omega_{sl}^2=0 and \\\\omega_f^2 = k^2 v_s^2. The slow wave thus disappears from the system, while the fast wave is just a sound wave, propagating isotropically.  Incompressible plasma  In case the plasma is incompressible, the sound speed v_s \\\\to \\\\infty (this follows from the energy equation) and it can then be shown that \\\\omega_{sl}^2 = \\\\omega_A^2 and \\\\omega_{f}^2 = \\\\infty. The slow wave thus propagates with the Alfv√©n speed (although it remains different from an Alfv√©n wave in its nature), while the fast wave disappears from the system.  Cold plasma  Under the assumption that the background temperature T_0=0, it follows from the perfect gas law that the thermal pressure p_0=0 and thus that v_s=0. In this case, \\\\omega_{sl}^2=0 and \\\\omega_f^2 = k^2 v_A^2. Hence there are no slow waves in the system, and the fast waves propagate isotropically with the Alfv√©n speed.  Inhomogeneous plasma  In the case of an inhomogeneous plasma, i.e. a plasma where at least one of the background quantities is not constant, the MHD waves lose their defining nature and get mixed properties. In some setups, such as the axisymmetric waves in a straight cylinder with a circular basis (one of the simplest models for a coronal loop), the three MHD waves can still be clearly distinguished. But in general, the pure Alfv√©n, fast and slow magnetosonic waves don't exist and the waves in the plasma are coupled to each other in intricate ways.

The term \\"wave front\\" was coined by Lars H√∂rmander around 1970. Introduction In more familiar terms, WF(f) tells not only where the function f is singular (which is already described by its singular support), but also how or why it is singular, by being more exact about the direction in which the singularity occurs. This concept is mostly useful in dimension at least two, since in one dimension there are only two possible directions. The complementary notion of a function being non-singular in a direction is microlocal smoothness. Intuitively, as an example, consider a function ∆í whose singular support is concentrated on a smooth curve in the plane at which the function has a jump discontinuity. In the direction tangent to the curve, the function remains smooth. By contrast, in the direction normal to the curve, the function has a singularity. To decide on whether the function is smooth in another direction v, one can try to smooth the function out by averaging in directions perpendicular to v. If the resulting function is smooth, then we regard ∆í to be smooth in the direction of v. Otherwise, v is in the wavefront set. Formally, in Euclidean space, the wave front set of ∆í is defined as the complement of the set of all pairs (x0,v) such that there exists a test function \\\\phi\\\\in C_c^\\\\infty with \\\\phi(x0) ‚â† 0 and an open cone Œì containing v such that the estimate :(\\\\phi f)^\\\\wedge(\\\\xi) \\\\le C_N(1+\\\\xi)^{-N}\\\\quad\\\\mbox{for all }\\\\ \\\\xi\\\\in\\\\Gamma holds for all positive integers N. Here (\\\\phi f)^\\\\wedge denotes the Fourier transform. Observe that the wavefront set is conical in the sense that if (x,v) ‚àà Wf(∆í), then (x,Œªv) ‚àà Wf(∆í) for all Œª > 0\\\\. In the example discussed in the previous paragraph, the wavefront set is the set-theoretic complement of the image of the tangent bundle of the curve inside the tangent bundle of the plane. Because the definition involves cutoff by a compactly supported function, the notion of a wave front set can be transported to any differentiable manifold X. In this more general situation, the wave front set is a closed conical subset of the cotangent bundle T*(X), since the Œæ variable naturally localizes to a covector rather than a vector. The wave front set is defined such that its projection on X is equal to the singular support of the function. Definition In Euclidean space, the wave front set of a distribution ∆í is defined as :{\\\\rm WF}(f) = \\\\\\\\{ (x,\\\\xi)\\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^n\\\\times\\\\mathbb{R}^n \\\\mid \\\\xi\\\\in\\\\Sigma_x(f)\\\\\\\\} where \\\\Sigma_x(f) is the singular fibre of ∆í at x. The singular fibre is defined to be the complement of all directions \\\\xi such that the Fourier transform of f, localized at x, is sufficiently regular when restricted to an open cone containing \\\\xi. More precisely, a direction v is in the complement of \\\\Sigma_x(f) if there is a compactly supported smooth function œÜ with œÜ(x) ‚â† 0 and an open cone Œì containing v such that the following estimate holds for each positive integer N: :(\\\\phi f)^\\\\wedge(\\\\xi) < c_N(1+\\\\xi)^{-N}\\\\quad{\\\\rm for~all}\\\\ \\\\xi\\\\in\\\\Gamma. Once such an estimate holds for a particular cutoff function œÜ at x, it also holds for all cutoff functions with smaller support, possibly for a different open cone containing v. On a differentiable manifold M, using local coordinates x,\\\\xi on the cotangent bundle, the wave front set WF(f) of a distribution ∆í can be defined in the following general way: : {\\\\rm WF}(f) = \\\\\\\\{ (x,\\\\xi)\\\\in T^*(X) \\\\mid \\\\xi\\\\in\\\\Sigma_x(f) \\\\\\\\} where the singular fibre \\\\Sigma_x(f) is again the complement of all directions \\\\xi such that the Fourier transform of f, localized at x, is sufficiently regular when restricted to a conical neighbourhood of \\\\xi. The problem of regularity is local, and so it can be checked in the local coordinate system, using the Fourier transform on the x variables. The required regularity estimate transforms well under diffeomorphism, and so the notion of regularity is independent of the choice of local coordinates. =Generalizations= The notion of a wave front set can be adapted to accommodate other notions of regularity of a function. Localized can here be expressed by saying that f is truncated by some smooth cutoff function not vanishing at x. (The localization process could be done in a more elegant fashion, using germs.) More concretely, this can be expressed as : \\\\xi otin\\\\Sigma_x(f) \\\\iff \\\\xi=0 \\\\text{ or }\\\\exists\\\\phi\\\\in\\\\mathcal D_x,\\\\ \\\\exists V\\\\in\\\\mathcal V_\\\\xi: \\\\widehat{\\\\phi f}_V\\\\in O(V) where *\\\\mathcal D_x are compactly supported smooth functions not vanishing at x, *\\\\mathcal V_\\\\xi are conical neighbourhoods of \\\\xi, i.e. neighbourhoods V such that c\\\\cdot V\\\\subset V for all c > 0, *\\\\widehat u_V denotes the Fourier transform of the (compactly supported generalized) function u, restricted to V, *O: \\\\Omega\\\\to O(\\\\Omega) is a fixed presheaf of functions (or distributions) whose choice enforces the desired regularity of the Fourier transform. Typically, sections of O are required to satisfy some growth (or decrease) condition at infinity, e.g. such that (1+\\\\xi)^s v(\\\\xi) belong to some Lp space. This definition makes sense, because the Fourier transform becomes more regular (in terms of growth at infinity) when f is truncated with the smooth cutoff \\\\phi. The most difficult \\"problem\\", from a theoretical point of view, is finding the adequate sheaf O characterizing functions belonging to a given subsheaf E of the space G of generalized functions. =Example= If we take G = D‚Ä≤ the space of Schwartz distributions and want to characterize distributions which are locally C^\\\\infty functions, we must take for O(Œ©) the classical function spaces called O‚Ä≤M(Œ©) in the literature. Then the projection on the first component of a distribution's wave front set is nothing else than its classical singular support, i.e. the complement of the set on which its restriction would be a smooth function. =Applications= The wave front set is useful, among others, when studying propagation of singularities by pseudodifferential operators.

The film focuses on an aging \\"Don Juan\\" who embarks on a cross-country journey to track down four of his former lovers after receiving an anonymous letter stating that he has a son. The film stars Bill Murray, Jeffrey Wright, Sharon Stone, Frances Conroy, Jessica Lange, Tilda Swinton, Julie Delpy, Mark Webber, Chlo√´ Sevigny, Christopher McDonald, and Alexis Dziena. Plot Don Johnston (Bill Murray), a former Don Juan who made a small fortune in the computer industry, wants to live in quiet retirement. He is content to lounge around watching old movies and listening to classical or easy listening music. His current girlfriend, Sherry (Julie Delpy), is ending their relationship and moving out of his house when a letter in a pink envelope arrives. After she walks out, Don reads the letter; it purports to be from an unnamed former girlfriend, informing him that he has a son who is nearly nineteen years old, and who may be looking for him. Initially, Don does not intend to do anything about it, but his busybody neighbor Winston (Jeffrey Wright), who is a mystery novel enthusiast, urges Don to investigate. Winston researches the current locations of the five women most likely to have written the letter and gives Don the information along with maps and flight reservations, and persuades him to visit them. Ultimately Don meets with four women (the fifth one had died before the events of the film), each encounter worse than the last and each woman damaged in some way: * Laura (Sharon Stone) works as a closet and drawer organizer and is the widow of a race car driver. She is very warm and receptive to Don's visit, but has a very forward teenage daughter, Lolita (Alexis Dziena), who parades nude in front of him before her mother arrives. That night, Laura sleeps with Don. * Dora (Frances Conroy) is a realtor. Once a \\"flower child\\" of the 1960s, she has reversed to the opposite extreme and is now living a suburban conservative middle class existence married to Ron (Christopher McDonald). The encounter, while friendly on the surface belies a great deal of tension with Ron coming across as threatening, and Dora as pained and nervous. * Carmen Markowski (Jessica Lange) works as an \\"animal communicator.\\" Don recalls how she was formerly so passionate about becoming a lawyer. She is cold to Don and seems to have a close relationship with her secretary (Chlo√´ Sevigny), who is very protective of her and unimpressed by Don's sudden visit. * Penny (Tilda Swinton) lives in a rural area amongst bikers. She appears to still harbour a great deal of resentment against Don, and when he asks if she has a son, she becomes furious. Two of the men appear after the commotion and punch Don out. The next morning, Don finds himself in his car, in the middle of a field, with a nasty cut near his left eye. Later, Don stops at a florist to buy flowers from a young woman named Sun Green (Pell James) who treats his cut. Don leaves the flowers at the grave of the fifth woman, Michelle Pepe. Finally, Don returns home where he finds a pink letter from Sherry, admitting she still likes him. He discusses the trip and second letter with Winston, who theorizes that Sherry might have written the original letter as a hoax. He then goes home to compare the two letters. Don then meets a young man in the street (Mark Webber) who he suspects may be his son. He buys him a meal, but when he remarks that the young man believes that Don is his father, the young man becomes agitated and flees. Don attempts to chase the man but gives up, standing in the middle of a crossroads. Don watches a Volkswagen Beetle drive past from which a young man (Bill Murray's son, Homer Murray) in the passenger seat makes eye contact with Don, while the same music Don has listened to on his trip plays from the passing car.

Director Jim Jarmusch had each of the four female leads write their own pink paper letter \\"in character\\" to plant in each one's mind the possibility that she was the mother of Don's supposed son. (The letter used in the film was a composite of the four.) In relation to the ending, Jarmusch said that the film is about \\"yearning for something that you're missing and not necessarily being able to define what it is\\". Slates for the film shown on the DVD extra \\"Broken Flowers: Start to Finish\\" list the title of the film as \\"Dead Flowers.\\" The film is dedicated to French director Jean Eustache. In an interview, Jarmusch said he felt close to Eustache for his commitment to making films in a unique and independent fashion. =Lawsuit= Reed Martin sued Jarmusch in March 2006, claiming that the director stole the film's concept from a very similar script that had circulated among several people eventually involved in the production. Jarmusch denied the charges and stated in response that Martin's claim has \\"absolutely no merit\\". On September 28, 2007, a federal district court judge dismissed Martin's lawsuit. Release Broken Flowers premiered in Europe at 2005 Cannes Film Festival on May 16, 2005. It opened on August 5, 2005 in the US in a limited release. It was released on video January 3, 2006. =Box office= The film was released theatrically on August 5, 2005 earning $780,408 from 27 theaters. After 15 weeks in release, the movie ended with a domestic total of $13,744,960. The film fared much better internationally, taking in $32,975,531 to bring its total gross to $46,720,491. =Critical reception= At the 2005 Cannes Film Festival, the film was nominated for the Palme d'Or and won the Grand Prix. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 87% of 194 surveyed critics wrote a positive review, with an average rating of 7.49/10.The site's critical consensus reads: \\"Bill Murray's subtle and understated style complements director Jim Jarmusch's minimalist storytelling in this quirky, but deadpan comedy.\\" According to Ken Tucker, \\"Broken Flowers relies on Bill Murray's persona, but it also turns that persona back on him. Instead of maintaining the satirical distance that made it easy to laugh at heartland eccentrics in, say, Alexander Payne's About Schmidt, Jarmusch's film avoids caricature, and Murray's poker face melts. Don feels a bittersweet regret at becoming exactly the sort of granite-faced wise guy Bill Murray has made his rep at enshrining. Murray is at a point in his career when his self-effacement has achieved high comic art, and he collaborates with Jarmusch at a point in his career when he's trying to be something more than hipster-serene. Both succeed, by committing to the notion that a yearning to be reborn within a hopeless, brittle soul is worthy of drama‚Äîas well as a deeper, gentler humor.\\" Peter Bradshaw called it \\"Jarmusch's most enjoyable, accessible work for some time, perhaps his most emotionally generous film - like Cronenberg, he has made a bold venture into the mainstream with a movie that creates a gentle cloud of happiness. It is, it must be said, a lot more forgiving about aging men than Alexander Payne's road-movies About Schmidt or Sideways, but it is still a very attractive piece of film-making, bolstered by terrific performances from an all-star cast, spearheaded by endlessly droll, seductively sensitive Bill Murray.\\" Soundtrack The soundtrack to the film features an eclectic mix of music, chiefly using instrumentals by Ethiopian jazz artist Mulatu Astatke as the main score, mixed with garage rock (The Brian Jonestown Massacre, The Greenhornes, Holly Golightly), stoner metal (Sleep), soul (Marvin Gaye), rocksteady reggae (The Tennors), and classical (Gabriel Faur√©'s Requiem).

He was one of the outstanding designers of furniture in the Art Nouveau style, and after 1901 formally served as one of the vice-presidents of the √âcole de Nancy. Louis Majorelle is one of those who contributed the most to the transformation of furniture. Thanks to posterity, we recognize today a piece of furniture from him as we recognize a piece of furniture from Andr√© Charles Boulle and Charles Cressent, the french Prince regent's favorite artists. During the early 18th century, Cressent replaced the magnificence of ebony and tortoiseshell associated with tin and copper by the softer harmonies of foreign woods. Like him, Louis Majorelle dressed the elegant structure of Art Nouveau furniture with exotic wood inlays. The palette he composed with wood from France and abroad, resembles that of a painter. Oak, walnut, ash, elm, holly, plane, chestnut, cherry, pear and beech provide the soft tones and the enveloping range of grays; they serve Majorelle in calm and deliberately monochrome compositions. Rosewood provides the delicate colors and patterns of the flower. The tender yellow lemon tree, the silver maple, the purple amaranth, dear to Cressent, the jacaranda wood, the red satin, the amourette, the orange clairembourg, the black or green ebony, the red or black palm, etc., constituted for him, among the foreign essences, the most extensive colored swell, where his painter instincts could flourish. Early life Majorelle was born in Toul. In 1861, his father, Auguste Majorelle (1825 - 1879), who himself was a furniture designer and manufacturer, moved the family from Toul to Nancy. There, Louis finished his initial studies before moving to Paris in 1877 for two years of work at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts. On the death of his father, he cut short his studies and returned to Nancy to oversee the family's manufactories of faience and furniture. This would occupy him for the rest of his life. On 7 April 1885, Majorelle married Marie L√©onie Jane Kretz (06/12/1864 - 31/12/1912), daughter of the director of the municipal theaters in Nancy. Their only child, Jacques Majorelle, who himself would become an artist, was born 7 March 1886.Alastair Duncan, Louis Majorelle: Master of Art Nouveau Design (New York: Abrams, 1991), 25. Direction of the Family Firm Salon du Caf√© de Paris designed by Louis Majorelle in 1898 The Majorelle firm's factory was designed by famous √âcole de Nancy architect Lucien Weissenburger (1860 - 1929) and located at 6, rue du Vieil-A√Ætre in the western part of Nancy. In the 1880s Majorelle turned out pastiches of Louis XV furniture styles, which he exhibited in 1894 at the Exposition d'Art D√©coratif et Industriel [Exposition of Decorative and Industrial Art] in Nancy, but the influence of the glass- and furniture-maker Emile Gall√© (1846 - 1904) inspired him to take his production in new directions. Beginning in the 1890s, Majorelle's furniture, embellished with inlays, took their inspiration from nature: stems of plants, waterlily leaves, tendrils, dragonflies. Before 1900 he added a metalworking atelier to the workshops, to produce drawerpulls and mounts in keeping with the fluid lines of his woodwork. His studio also was responsible for the ironwork of balconies, staircase railings, and exterior details on many buildings in Nancy at the turn of the twentieth century. Some of his original woodwork designs can still be found in Grand Hotel Moderne, Lourdes. Often collaborating on lamp designs with the Daum Fr√®res glassworks of Nancy, he helped make the city one of the European centers of Art Nouveau. At the apogee of the Belle √©poque, during the 1900 Paris World's Fair (Exposition Universelle), Majorelle's designs triumphed and drew him an international clientele. By 1910, Majorelle had opened shops for his furniture in Nancy, Paris, Lyon, and Lille. Majorelle and the √âcole de Nancy A mahogany bed, known as the N√©nuphar bed for its water lily motifs, designed and manufactured by Louis Majorelle around 1902-3, on display at the Mus√©e d'Orsay, Paris. In February 1901, Majorelle became one of the founding members of the √âcole de Nancy, alternatively known as the Alliance provinciale des industries d'art, which was a group of artists, architects, art critics, and industrialists in Lorraine who decided to work in a collaborative fashion, and predominantly in the Art Nouveau style. They, headed by Gall√© (until his death in 1904, and thereafter by Victor Prouv√©) did this for several reasons, chief among which was to ensure a high standard of quality of work in the French decorative arts, of which Lorraine artists were the chief producers at the time. Majorelle was one of the vice-presidents of the group from the outset, remained so throughout the existence of the √âcole de Nancy, and was certainly considered one of the group's leaders. For the most part, he and the other members worked to promote the work of Lorraine decorative artists through their advocacy of the establishment of a school for industrial arts, their participation at major exhibitions (as well as organizing their own shows), and through their collaborative efforts on individual art pieces and buildings, almost all of which were in the Art Nouveau style, and which helped produce to some extant a unity among the art and architecture produced by Lorrainers. Majorelle was consistently one of the internationally renowned figures of the group who could always be found at any show at which the group exhibited. His connections with the Parisian art circles also helped assure the renown of Lorraine artists in the French capital. The √âcole de Nancy, however, was often in short supply of funding, and the formal artistic cooperation among its members slowly seemed to disintegrate during the First World War. The Villa Majorelle The Villa Majorelle, located at 1, rue Louis Majorelle in Nancy, in July 2004. In 1898, Majorelle hired Henri Sauvage (1873 - 1932), a young Parisian architect, to collaborate with Weissenburger on the building of his own house, known as the Villa Jika (after the acronym of Majorelle's wife's maiden name), but now popularly known as simply the Villa Majorelle, in Nancy. Majorelle, like many industrialists in Nancy, located his house across the street from his factory, but in a relatively new area of town, the large parcel of land which it occupied made it seem like a veritable country estate. His house and factory were located on land that was given to him by his mother-in-law, Madame Kretz. Sauvage and Weissenburger's three-story design for the villa represents the true flowering of Art Nouveau architecture in Nancy, with multiple bow windows and floral motifs covering the exterior. Majorelle himself produced the ironwork, furniture, and the interior woodwork, such as the grand staircase. Majorelle located his own personal studio on the third floor under a gabled roof, and included a huge arched window combled together with spandrels that evoke the branches of a tree or flower. Most of the floral motifs seen in the house use the forms of the monnaie-du-pape plant. In addition, Majorelle employed Jacques Gruber to create the original stained glass for the house, and on the interior, the artisans created impressive painted friezes in the dining room, which contains a large ceramic Art Nouveau fireplace designed by Alexandre Bigot. World War I and Majorelle's Late Career Stained glass window, headquarters of the Longwy steel factory In 1914, with the outbreak of war, Majorelle hoped to hold out and continue production in Nancy. Unfortunately, in an event apparently unrelated to the war, his factories on the rue du Vieil-A√Ætre suddenly caught fire on the morning of 20 November 1916. The conflagration, no doubt spurred on by the fresh supply of lumber, unfinished furniture, and sawdust, burned virtually all the firm's sketches, awards, molds, equipment, and archives that documented the fifty-year history of the enterprise. As if to add insult to injury, a year later, in 1917 German aircraft bombing of Nancy destroyed the Majorelle shop on the rue Saint-Georges. The Majorelle family reported that their shop in Lille had been looted by advancing German troops. Majorelle relocated to Paris for the remainder of the war, where he worked in the workshops of fellow furniture designers. After the war, he reopened the factory and his shop, and continued to collaborate with the Daum glassworks and produce furniture, though these late designs show the stiffened geometry of Art Deco. Majorelle died in Nancy in 1926 in his beautiful property on rue du Vieil-A√Ætre, leaving to his brothers Jules and Pierre, the management of the store on rue Saint-Georges in Nancy and the sawmill of Bouxi√®res-aux-Dames. After his death, his family, whose fortunes had been damaged severely by the war, could no longer afford to live in the Villa Majorelle, and the house and much of the outlying property were sold off in parcels. Majorelle's factories closed in 1931. Eventually, the villa went through several architectural modifications (aside from those Majorelle himself made while he resided there), including the addition of a concrete bunker near the rear and the enclosure of the front terrasse. The large stone fence and gate that surrounded the property were eventually reduced to a small piece around the house, which itself went through various uses and owners over the next century. Today, the Villa has been acquired by the city of Nancy, which is undertaking a long-term project of renovation and restoration.

The name Cloister was at first selected until it was discovered that Yale already had an institution of similar name. About that time the document known as the Charter for the College of New Jersey was found and presented to the University. Charter's current neighbor to the west, Cloister Inn, later took the discarded name. A small building on Olden Street‚Äîknown as the \\"Incubator\\" because several other clubs had started there while they waited for sufficient finances to buy or build a proper clubhouse‚Äîwas leased and the furnishing paid for by subscriptions. In the spring of 1903 the Club purchased three lots and a house on Prospect Avenue which constitutes three-quarters of the present property. The house was redesigned and enlarged under the supervision of an undergraduate member David Adler of the 1904 Section, with the assistance of Professor Harris of the Faculty.Charter Club The funds for the purchase of this property and the alterations to this second clubhouse were raised by the sale of nineteen $1,000 mortgage bonds. The \\"Adler Clubhouse\\" would house Charter Club for a decade, until the present \\"Third Clubhouse\\", designed by architectural firm Mellor & MeigsMellor & Meigs (fl. 1906-1916 and 1928-1941) - Philadelphia Architects and Buildings was completed in the fall of 1914. Additionally, Charter's real estate assets had grown. In early 1905, at least one adjacent lot was purchased. In the summer of 1905, a squash court was built behind the clubhouse. The expansion of the land holdings encouraged the membership and graduate section of Charter to build the Third Clubhouse, which was and is a far more imposing edifice than either the Adler Clubhouse or even the \\"Incubator\\". Today, Charter is widely regarded as having one of the finest clubhouses on \\"The Street.\\" After the United States entered World War I, Charter was temporarily closed due to reduced membership caused by widespread member enlistment in the armed forces. For a period of less than two years, between 1917 and 1919, the Charter clubhouse closed its doors, and Charter members left on campus received full membership privileges at Cottage Club. Charter lost seven members in the war, and their sacrifice is commemorated by a plaque located in the \\"Great Room.\\" Reopening in 1919, Charter quickly gained a reputation as a club personifying the era of the Roaring '20s, carving a niche for itself on campus in the inter-war years.Hometown Boy  The Jimmy Stewart Museum World War II saw Charter closing along with all of its peer institutions, as members almost universally went off to fight abroad. Charter greatly expanded its membership after the war, but disaster struck closer to home in 1949 when a fire spread rapidly through much of the first and second floors causing heavy damage. A fire marshal summoned to the scene of the fire, on seeing the facade of Charter seemingly unaffected, declared famously, \\"I have never seen a building survive a fire like this, nothing is indestructible, but this place is damn near.\\" Charter's membership has since often referred to it as \\"The Indestructible Charter Club,\\" or simply \\"The Indestructible.\\" Charter was known throughout the 1950s and 1960s for its hard partying ways‚ÄîCharter parties were only rivaled at the time by those at perennial animal house Cannon Club. It is suspected, but not known, that at least one Charter member rode with members of Cap and Gown Club in the so- called Great Train Robbery of '63, in which the \\"dinky\\" train running from Princeton Junction into Princeton was forced to make a dramatic emergency stop after a car was seen on the tracks, at which point ersatz cowboys rode up to the train on horseback and carried off their dates who had been arriving for the weekend. The greatest era of the Eating Clubs was beginning to fade by the late sixties, however, and looking to prop up stagnating membership figures, Charter announced that it would accept female members, over the objection of many members of the grad board, shortly after the University made the switch to coeducation. In 1977, Charter made the switch from bicker selectivity to sign-in openness in order to draw more members. The club remained financially stable throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, as six of its peers shut their doors permanently. Throughout this tumultuous period, Charter never quite lost its carefree atmosphere and wild touch‚Äîbest exemplified perhaps by the infamous Initiation Night of 1988. In 1988, Charter counted as members most of the Varsity Football Team, including many of the '89 section's officers. It was some of these gridiron heroes who allegedly planned the raucous celebration of the admission of the new sophomore section which led to 45 members sent to McCosh Infirmary or Princeton Medical Center for alcohol- related reasons. The Princeton Borough Police quickly rounded up the Charter officer corps, and criminal charges were brought against the president and social chair, who were convicted of serving alcohol to minors, fined $500, and sentenced to 30 days in jail. The sentences were later overturned by a Mercer County Court judge, and the two undergraduate officers received probation and were ordered to perform community service.The New York Times, Craig Bloom, \\"Clubs at Princeton Curb Drinking\\" 12 February 1989 To prevent a similar occurrence, but also to commemorate forever this fateful night, Charter now conducts formal initiations a week after all the other eating clubs, and on what would otherwise be initiation night officially \\"goes dry.\\" Initiation Night '88 is generally considered to be, along with the Section Party of 1930, one of Charter's most infamous moments.More Than a Meal Plan - New York Times In the fall of 2010, Charter announced major modifications to its membership admission system, creating a \\"weighted sign-in\\" system that gives preference to sophomores judged to be more enthusiastic about the club, based on their involvement in club activities and attendance at events open to sophomores.\\" http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/2010/09/20/26263/ In February 2011, operating under this new system, Charter was again the only sign in club to fill its sophomore section in the first round of sign-ins.

It is the oldest and the largest circulated Tamil Newspaper in Sri Lanka. Virakesari is owned by Express Newspapers (Ceylon) (Private) Limited, a leading print and web media organization in Sri Lanka.  History  Virakesari was founded by PPR. Subramanian in the first half of 20th century. Subramanian was an entrepreneur and journalist from the village Avanipatti in Tamil Nadu, India. Upon immigrating from India to British Ceylon, he saw the conditions of the Indian Labourers and decided that he would establish a newspaper to promote justice and equality for those people by publishing a newspaper with a distinct voice of its own. The First Page of Virakesari in 1930 The first edition was published on 6 August 1930 under the masthead Virakesari meaning \\"Victorious Lion\\" . Subramanian guided the publication for over 20 years, during which the publication focused on the rights and grievances of the Plantation workers, capturing the attention of the Tamil speaking population. Today, this newspaper is the most widely circulated and read newspaper by the entire Tamil speaking population in Sri Lanka. In 1948, soon after Ceylon obtained independence from British dominance, the Ceylon Parliament enacted the Ceylon Citizenship Act. Faced with the choice of obtaining Ceylonese citizenship or continuing with his Indian citizenship, Subramanian chose to return to his homeland, unable to come to terms with losing his nationality. Before his departure, he sold his interests to a small group of Ceylonese Citizens of Indian origin. In 1965, during the period of political upheaval in Sri Lanka, the Virakesari newspaper was taken over by a Sinhalese political party with the intention of introducing a Sinhalese national newspaper. However, as fate would have it, the company was sued for defamation compelling the new owners to relinquish control, reverting ownership to the earlier owners. In 1970, Express Newspapers (Ceylon) Limited was registered as a private company and as publisher of the Virakesari newspaper. It was the intention of the Directors that as a company, expansion programs could provide for a wide range of Tamil language publications for the Tamil speaking population. Today, Virakesari has evolved into a national newspaper with the motto \\"Tharamana Valiyil Thelivaana Thagaval\\" [\\"Quality news with clarity\\"]. Express Newspapers (Ceylon) Limited also publishes a wide range of magazines and newspapers catering to the different sectors and markets of the Tamil speaking population. Online presence The Online Division of Express Newspapers launched virakesari.lk, a 24x7 breaking news website, in 2002, and in 2005 they launched Virakesari's E-paper, which was the world's first Tamil E-paper. The websites boasts of over 2.5 million hits from across the world. Virakesari also plays a significant role in the field of social media having large numbers of young audience engaged on their websites.

The genus is abbreviated Chy in trade journals. Description The genus is typified by elongate, spindle-shaped, usually pendulous pseudobulbs of several internodes, which may be fat or slender, depending on the species. The leaves tend to be quite soft and papery, strongly ribbed and long. The leaves can take a good deal more light than is apparent from their thickness. This genus also tends to be partially deciduous, though leaves are often retained for two years. The inflorescences are multi-flowered and arise from the base of the pseudobulb with the new growth. Flower colour tends to range from white (as in Chysis bractescens) to orange-yellow (as in Chysis aurea and Chysis laevis), and the pollinia often tend to be fused (hence the genus name Chysis which is Greek for \\"melting\\"). Chysis are epiphytic and grow under shady and damp conditions up to 1000 meters elevation. The plants should be grown under intermediate conditions, generally mounted due to their pendulous habit, though some species adapt well to pot culture. The plants are greedy should be watered and fed heavily while they are in active growth, though rather less once the seasons growth is completed. They should never be allowed to completely dry out, however, even during the rest period, and the pseudobulbs should never be seen to shrivel.

She was the first Fijian woman to serve as Leader of the Opposition. She previously held the position of deputy Prime Minister in the Qarase-led Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua (SDL) government from 2001 to 2006. As the paramount chief of the Burebasaga Confederacy, she holds the title Roko Tui Dreketi. Personal life Kepa is originally from Lomanikoro, Rewa, and has maternal links to Nadroga. She graduated from the University of the South Pacific with a Bachelor of Arts, and served as Principal of Corpus Christi College and then as a students' coordinator at the University of the South Pacific. She succeeded her late sister, former Ro Lady Lala Mara, as Roko Tui Dreketi, or Paramount Chief of Burebasaga, in 2004. This is considered to be the highest title in the Burebasaga Confederacy, one of three \\"confederacies\\", or tribal networks, of Fijian chiefs. Ro Teimumu Kepa is the widow of Sailosi Kepa, a former High Commissioner to London, Minister of Justice and Attorney General (1988‚Äì1992), who went on to become a High Court Judge, Ombudsman, and first chairman of Fiji's Human Rights Commission. In July 2016, Kepa was awarded a Peace Award by the Universal Peace Federation in Nepal and was accorded as a Global Peace Ambassador or Ambassador for Peace. Political career In 1999 Kepa was appointed to the Senate. Following the 2000 Fijian coup d'√©tat she was appointed as Minister for Women, Culture, and Social Welfare in the interim government of Laisenia Qarase. She contested the 2001 election as a candidate for the Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua in the Rewa communal constituency, winning it with 2,636 votes. Following the election she was appointed as Minister for Education. On 5 May 2005 she was elected as chairperson of the Rewa Provincial Council, a position previously held by her sister Ro Lady Lala Mara. This led to claims that she had forfeited her seat in Parliament, resulting in her resigning from the council in August 2005. In October 2005, Kepa was elected to the executive board of UNESCO, to which the Fijian government had nominated her in late September. Kepa stood again for Rewa in the 2006 election, defeating her nephew, Ro Filipe Tuisawau. She was reappointed as Minister for Education, Youth and Sports in the multi-party cabinet. When the Qarase government was deposed by the 2006 Fijian coup d'√©tat, Kepa joined a court case challenging the legality of the coup. She also used her position in the Great Council of Chiefs to oppose the coup, and was instrumental in the Council's 2007 rejection of Epeli Nailatikau nomination as Vice-President. As a result, the Council was suspended. In May 2007, Kepa was threatened by the military over her opposition to the coup. However she continued to speak out against the regime and its People's Charter for Change, Peace and Progress. In July 2009 she was arrested and charged with breaching public emergency regulations and conspiracy to cause disorder after offering that her province would host the annual conference of the Methodist Church of Fiji and Rotuma, which the military regime had banned. The charges were later dropped. In 2011 the military regime suspended the Rewa Provincial Council in another effort to silence her. In March 2014 Kepa was elected leader of the newly formed Social Democratic Liberal Party. She led the party into the 2014 election. The party won 15 of the 50 parliamentary seats; Kepa, who won 49,485 votes in her own name, was the second-highest ranked candidate behind Bainimarama. On 6 October 2014 Kepa was appointed Leader of the Opposition. In June 2016, Kepa announced that she was standing down as leader of SODELPA. She was replaced by former Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka. She was re-elected in the 2018 elections, winning 6,036 votes, the second-highest of any female candidate.

At crystalline state, obtained with an X-ray diffraction. [2.2.2]Cryptand Cryptands are a family of synthetic bicyclic and polycyclic multidentate ligands for a variety of cations. The Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1987 was given to Donald J. Cram, Jean-Marie Lehn, and Charles J. Pedersen for their efforts in discovering and determining uses of cryptands and crown ethers, thus launching the now flourishing field of supramolecular chemistry. The term cryptand implies that this ligand binds substrates in a crypt, interring the guest as in a burial. These molecules are three-dimensional analogues of crown ethers but are more selective and strong as complexes for the guest ions. The resulting complexes are lipophilic. Structure The most common and most important cryptand is N[CH2CH2OCH2CH2OCH2CH2]3N; the systematic IUPAC name for this compound is 1,10-diaza-4,7,13,16,21,24-hexaoxabicyclo[8.8.8]hexacosane. This compound is termed [2.2.2]cryptand, where the numbers indicate the number of ether oxygen atoms (and hence binding sites) in each of the three bridges between the amine nitrogen caps. Many cryptands are commercially available under the tradename Kryptofix. All-amine cryptands exhibit particularly high affinity for alkali metal cations, which has allowed the isolation of salts of K‚àí. Properties =Cation binding= The three-dimensional interior cavity of a cryptand provides a binding site ‚Äì or host ‚Äì for \\"guest\\" ions. The complex between the cationic guest and the cryptand is called a cryptate. Cryptands form complexes with many \\"hard cations\\" including , lanthanoids, alkali metals, and alkaline earth metals. In contrast to crown ethers, cryptands bind the guest ions using both nitrogen and oxygen donors. This three-dimensional encapsulation mode confers some size-selectivity, enabling discrimination among alkali metal cations (e.g. Na+ vs. K+). Some cryptands are luminescent. =Anion binding= Polyamine-based cryptands can be converted to polyammonium cages, which exhibit high affinities for anions. Uses Cryptands are more expensive and difficult to prepare, but offer much better selectivity and strength of binding than other complexants for alkali metals, such as crown ethers. They are able to bind otherwise insoluble salts into organic solvents. They can also be used as phase transfer catalysts by transferring ions from one phase to another. Cryptands enabled the synthesis of the alkalides and electrides. They have also been used in the crystallization of Zintl ions such as .

It originates from the works of 19th-century German philosophers Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. As Marxism has developed over time into various branches and schools of thought, there is currently no single definitive Marxist theory. Some Marxist schools of thought place greater emphasis on certain aspects of classical Marxism while rejecting or modifying other aspects. Some schools have sought to combine Marxian concepts and non-Marxian concepts which has then led to contradictory conclusions. It has been argued that there is a movement toward the recognition of historical and dialectical materialism as the fundamental conceptions of all Marxist schools of thought. This view is refuted by some post-Marxists such as Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe, who claim that history is not only determined by the mode of production, but also by consciousness and will. Marxism has had a profound impact on global academia, having influenced many fields, including anthropology, archaeology, art theory, criminology, cultural studies, economics, education, ethics, film theory, geography, historiography, literary criticism, media studies,Manuel Alvarado, Robin Gutch, and Tana Wollen (1987). Learning the Media: Introduction to Media Teaching, Palgrave Macmillan, pp. 62, 76. philosophy, political science, psychology, science studies, sociology and theater.  Overview  Karl Marx Marxism seeks to explain social phenomena within any given society by analyzing the material conditions and economic activities required to fulfill human material needs. It assumes that the form of economic organization, or mode of production, influences all other social phenomena including wider social relations, political institutions, legal systems, cultural systems, aesthetics and ideologies. These social relations, together with the economic system, form a base and superstructure. As forces of production (i.e. technology) improve, existing forms of organizing production become obsolete and hinder further progress. As Karl Marx observed:Marx, Karl. 1859. \\"Introduction.\\" A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy. > At a certain stage of development, the material productive forces of society > come into conflict with the existing relations of production or‚Äîthis merely > expresses the same thing in legal terms‚Äîwith the property relations within > the framework of which they have operated hitherto. From forms of > development of the productive forces these relations turn into their > fetters. Then begins an era of social revolution. These inefficiencies manifest themselves as social contradictions in society which are, in turn, fought out at the level of class struggle.Gregory, Paul R., and Robert C. Stuart. 2003. \\"Marx's Theory of Change.\\" In Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First Century (7th ed.). . p. 62. Under the capitalist mode of production, this struggle materializes between the minority who own the means of production (the bourgeoisie) and the vast majority of the population who produce goods and services (the proletariat). Starting with the conjectural premise that social change occurs as result of the struggle between different classes within society who contradict one another, a Marxist would conclude that capitalism exploits and oppresses the proletariat, therefore capitalism will inevitably lead to a proletarian revolution. In a socialist society, private property‚Äîas the means of production‚Äîwould be replaced by co-operative ownership. A socialist economy would not base production on the creation of private profits, but on the criteria of satisfying human needs‚Äîthat is, production for use. As Friedrich Engels explains:Engels, Friedrich (1882). \\"Historical Materialism\\". Part 3 in Socialism: Utopian and Scientific. > Then the capitalist mode of appropriation, in which the product enslaves > first the producer, and then the appropriator, is replaced by the mode of > appropriation of the products that is based upon the nature of the modern > means of production; upon the one hand, direct social appropriation, as > means to the maintenance and extension of production ‚Äî on the other, direct > individual appropriation, as means of subsistence and of enjoyment. Marxian economics and its proponents view capitalism as economically unsustainable and incapable of improving the living standards of the population due to its need to compensate for falling rate of profit by cutting employees' wages and social benefits while pursuing military aggression. The socialist mode of production would succeed capitalism as humanity's mode of production through revolution by workers. According to Marxian crisis theory, socialism is not an inevitability, but an economic necessity.The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon (1852). Free will, non-predestination and non- determinism are emphasized in Marx's famous quote \\"Men make their own history\\". = Etymology = The term Marxism was popularized by Karl Kautsky, who considered himself an orthodox Marxist during the dispute between the orthodox and revisionist followers of Marx.Haupt, Georges, Peter Fawcett, and Eric Hobsbawm. 2010. Aspects of International Socialism, 1871‚Äì1914: Essays by Georges Haupt (paperback ed.). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. Kautsky's revisionist rival Eduard Bernstein also later adopted use of the term. Engels did not support the use of the term Marxism to describe either Marx's or his own views. He claimed that the term was being abusively used as a rhetorical qualifier by those attempting to cast themselves as real followers of Marx while casting others in different terms such as Lassallians. In 1882, Engels claimed that Marx had criticized self-proclaimed Marxist Paul Lafargue by saying that if Lafargue's views were considered Marxist, then \\"one thing is certain and that is that I am not a Marxist\\". = Historical materialism = Marxism uses a materialist methodology, referred to by Marx and Engels as the materialist conception of history and later better known as historical materialism, to analyse the underlying causes of societal development and change from the perspective of the collective ways in which humans make their living.Evans, p. 53.

All constituent features of a society (social classes, political pyramid and ideologies) are assumed to stem from economic activity, forming what is considered as the base and superstructure. The base and superstructure metaphor describes the totality of social relations by which humans produce and re-produce their social existence. According to Marx, \\"[t]he sum total of the forces of production accessible to men determines the condition of society\\" and forms a society's economic base.Chambre, Henri; McLellan, David T. (2020) [1998]. \\"Marxism\\". \\"Historical materialism\\". Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Retrieved 11 July 2020. The base includes the material forces of production such as the labour, means of production and relations of production, i.e. the social and political arrangements that regulate production and distribution. From this base rises a superstructure of legal and political \\"forms of social consciousness\\" that derive from the economic base that conditions both the superstructure and the dominant ideology of a society. Conflicts between the development of material productive forces and the relations of production provokes social revolutions, whereby changes to the economic base leads to the social transformation of the superstructure.Marx, Karl. [1859] 1977. \\"Preface.\\" A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy. Moscow: Progress Publishers.Engels, Friedrich. [1877] 1947. \\"Introduction.\\" In Anti-D√ºhring: Herr Eugen D√ºhring‚Äôs Revolution in Science. Moscow: Progress Publishers. This relationship is reflexive, in that the base initially gives rise to the superstructure and remains the foundation of a form of social organization. Those newly formed social organizations can then act again upon both parts of the base and superstructure so that rather than being static, the relationship dialectic, expressed and driven by conflicts and contradictions. As Engels clarifies:Marx, Karl, and Friedrich Engels. [1847] 1888. \\"Bourgeoisie and Proletariat.\\" Ch. 1 in The Communist Manifesto, edited by F. Engels. > The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class > struggles. Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild- > master and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant > opposition to one another, carried on uninterrupted, now hidden, now open > fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary > reconstitution of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending > classes. Marx considered recurring class conflicts as the driving force of human history as such conflicts have manifested themselves as distinct transitional stages of development in Western Europe. Accordingly, Marx designated human history as encompassing four stages of development in relations of production: # Primitive communism: co-operative tribal societies. # Slave society: development of tribal to city-state in which aristocracy is born. # Feudalism: aristocrats are the ruling class while merchants evolve into capitalists. # Capitalism: capitalists are the ruling class, who create and employ the proletariat. While historical materialism has been referred to as a materialist theory of history, Marx does not claim to have produced a master- key to history and that the materialist conception of history is not \\"an historico-philosophic theory of the marche generale, imposed by fate upon every people, whatever the historic circumstances in which it finds itself\\". In a letter to editor of the Russian newspaper paper Otetchestvennye Zapiskym (1877), he explains that his ideas are based upon a concrete study of the actual conditions in Europe.Marx, Karl; Engels, Friedrich (1968) [1877]. \\"Letter from Marx to Editor of the Otecestvenniye Zapisky\\". Marx and Engels Correspondence. New York: International Publishers. Retrieved 11 July 2020 ‚Äì via Marxists Internet Archive. = Criticism of capitalism = According to the Marxist theoretician and revolutionary socialist Vladimir Lenin, \\"the principal content of Marxism\\" was \\"Marx's economic doctrine\\".Lenin 1967 (1913). p. 7. Marx believed that the capitalist bourgeoisie and their economists were promoting what he saw as the lie that \\"the interests of the capitalist and of the worker are [...] one and the same\\". Thus, he believed that they did this by purporting the concept that \\"the fastest possible growth of productive capital\\" was best not only for the wealthy capitalists but also for the workers because it provided them with employment.Marx 1849. Exploitation is a matter of surplus labour‚Äîthe amount of labour performed beyond what is received in goods. Exploitation has been a socioeconomic feature of every class society and is one of the principal features distinguishing the social classes. The power of one social class to control the means of production enables its exploitation of other classes. Under capitalism, the labour theory of value is the operative concern, whereby the value of a commodity equals the socially necessary labour time required to produce it. Under such condition, surplus value‚Äîthe difference between the value produced and the value received by a labourer‚Äîis synonymous with the term surplus labour and capitalist exploitation is thus realised as deriving surplus value from the worker. In pre-capitalist economies, exploitation of the worker was achieved via physical coercion. Under the capitalist mode of production, those results are more subtly achieved because workers do not own the means of production and must \\"voluntarily\\" enter into an exploitive work relationship with a capitalist in order to earn the necessities of life. The worker's entry into such employment is voluntary in that they choose which capitalist to work for. However, the worker must work or starve, thus exploitation is inevitable and the voluntary nature of a worker participating in a capitalist society is illusory; it is production, not circulation, that causes exploitation. Marx emphasised that capitalism per se does not cheat the worker. Alienation (German: Gattungswesen, \\"species-essence\\" or \\"species- being\\") is the estrangement of people from their humanity, and a systematic result of capitalism. Under capitalism, the fruits of production belong to employers, who expropriate the surplus created by others and so generate alienated labourers. In Marx's view, alienation is an objective characterization of the worker's situation in capitalism‚Äîhis or her self- awareness of this condition is not prerequisite.\\"Alienation\\". A Dictionary of Sociology. = Social classes = Marx distinguishes social classes on the basis of two criteria, i.e. ownership of means of production and control over the labour power of others. Following this criterion of class based on property relations, Marx identified the social stratification of the capitalist mode of production with the following social groups: * Proletariat: \\"[T]he class of modern wage labourers who, having no means of production of their own, are reduced to selling their labour power in order to live\\". The capitalist mode of production establishes the conditions that enable the bourgeoisie to exploit the proletariat as the worker's labour generates a surplus value greater than the worker's wage. ** Lumpenproletariat: the outcasts of society, such as the criminals, vagabonds, beggars, or prostitutes, without any political or class consciousness. Having no interest in national, let alone international, economic affairs, Marx claimed that this specific sub-division of the proletariat would play no part in the eventual social revolution. * Bourgeoisie: those who \\"own the means of production\\" and buy labour power from the proletariat, thus exploiting the proletariat. They subdivide as bourgeoisie and the petite bourgeoisie. ** Petite bourgeoisie: those who work and can afford to buy little labour power (i.e. small business owners, peasants landlords and trade workers). Marxism predicts that the continual reinvention of the means of production eventually would destroy the petite bourgeoisie, degrading them from the middle class to the proletariat. * Landlords: a historically important social class who retain some wealth and power. * Peasantry and farmers: a scattered class incapable of organizing and effecting socio-economic change, most of whom would enter the proletariat while some would become landlords. Class consciousness denotes the awareness‚Äîof itself and the social world‚Äîthat a social class possesses as well as its capacity to rationally act in their best interests. Class consciousness is required before a social class can effect a successful revolution and thus the dictatorship of the proletariat. Without defining ideology,McCarney, Joseph. 2005. \\"Ideology and False Consciousness.\\" Ch. 16 in Marx Myths and Legends, edited by R. Lucas and A. Blunden. Archived from the original on 9 May 2013. Marx used the term to describe the production of images of social reality. According to Engels:Engels, Friedrich. [14 July 1893] 1968. \\"Letter to Franz Mehring.\\" Marx and Engels Correspondence, translated by D. Torr. London: International Publishers. > [I]deology is a process accomplished by the so-called thinker consciously, > it is true, but with a false consciousness. The real motive forces impelling > him remain unknown to him; otherwise it simply would not be an ideological > process. Hence he imagines false or seeming motive forces. Because the ruling class controls the society's means of production, the superstructure of society (i.e. the ruling social ideas), are determined by the best interests of the ruling class. In The German Ideology, Marx says that \\"[t]he ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas, i.e. the class which is the ruling material force of society, is, at the same time, its ruling intellectual force\\". The term political economy initially referred to the study of the material conditions of economic production in the capitalist system. In Marxism, political economy is the study of the means of production, specifically of capital and how that manifests as economic activity. This new way of thinking was invented because socialists believed that common ownership of the means of production (i.e. the industries, land, wealth of nature, trade apparatus and wealth of the society) would abolish the exploitative working conditions experienced under capitalism. Through working class revolution, the state (which Marxists saw as a weapon for the subjugation of one class by another) is seized and used to suppress the hitherto ruling class of capitalists and (by implementing a commonly owned, democratically controlled workplace) create the society of communism which Marxists see as true democracy. An economy based on co-operation on human need and social betterment, rather than competition for profit of many independently acting profit seekers, would also be the end of class society, which Marx saw as the fundamental division of all hitherto existing history. Marx saw work, the effort by humans to transform the environment for their needs, as a fundamental feature of human kind. Capitalism, in which the product of the worker's labour is taken from them and sold at market rather than being part of the worker's life, is therefore alienating to the worker. Additionally, the worker is compelled by various means (some nicer than others) to work harder, faster and for longer hours. While this is happening, the employer is constantly trying to save on labour costs by paying the workers less and figuring out how to use cheaper equipment. This allows the employer to extract the largest amount of work and therefore potential wealth from their workers. The fundamental nature of capitalist society is no different from that of slave society, in that one small group of society exploiting the larger group. Through common ownership of the means of production, the profit motive is eliminated and the motive of furthering human flourishing is introduced. Because the surplus produced by the workers is the property of the society as a whole, there are no classes of producers and appropriators. Additionally, as the state has its origins in the bands of retainers hired by the first ruling classes to protect their economic privilege, it will wither away as its conditions of existence have disappeared.Kurian, George Thomas. 2011. \\"Withering Away of the State.\\" P. 1776 in The Encyclopedia of Political Science. Washington, DC: CQ Press. . = Communism, revolution and socialism = red flag with a raised fist, both symbols of revolutionary socialism According to The Oxford Handbook of Karl Marx, \\"Marx used many terms to refer to a post-capitalist society‚Äîpositive humanism, socialism, Communism, realm of free individuality, free association of producers, etc. He used these terms completely interchangeably. The notion that \\"socialism\\" and \\"Communism\\" are distinct historical stages is alien to his work and only entered the lexicon of Marxism after his death\\".Hudis, Peter; Vidal, Matt, Smith, Tony; Rotta, Tom√°s; Prew, Paul, eds.

According to orthodox Marxist theory, the overthrow of capitalism by a socialist revolution in contemporary society is inevitable. While the inevitability of an eventual socialist revolution is a controversial debate among many different Marxist schools of thought, all Marxists believe socialism is a necessity. Marxists argue that a socialist society is far better for the majority of the populace than its capitalist counterpart. Prior to the Russian Revolution, Vladimir Lenin wrote:Lenin 1967 (1913). pp. 35‚Äì36. > The socialization of production is bound to lead to the conversion of the > means of production into the property of society. [...] This conversion will > directly result in an immense increase in productivity of labour, a > reduction of working hours, and the replacement of the remnants, the ruins > of small-scale, primitive, disunited production by collective and improved > labour. The failure of the 1905 Russian Revolution, along with the failure of socialist movements to resist the outbreak of World War I, led to renewed theoretical effort and valuable contributions from Lenin and Rosa Luxemburg towards an appreciation of Marx's crisis theory and efforts to formulate a theory of imperialism.Kuruma, Samezo. 1929. \\"An Introduction to the Theory of Crisis,\\" translated by M.

From Marx's letter derives the paraphrase, \\"If that is Marxism, then I am not a Marxist\\".

London: Palgrave Macmillan. emphasizing the Marxist belief in the ability of the working class to forge its own destiny without the need for a vanguard party to mediate or aid its liberation.Draper, Hal. 1971. \\"The Principle of Self-Emancipation in Marx and Engels.\\" The Socialist Register 4:81‚Äì104. . Along with anarchism, libertarian Marxism is one of the main currents of libertarian socialism.Chomsky, Noam. 16 February 1970. \\"Government In The Future\\" (Lecture). The Poetry Center in New York. . Libertarian Marxism includes currents such as autonomism, council communism, De Leonism, Lettrism, parts of the New Left, Situationism, Socialisme ou Barbarie and workerism. Libertarian Marxism has often had a strong influence on both post-left and social anarchists. Notable theorists of libertarian Marxism have included Maurice Brinton, Cornelius Castoriadis, Guy Debord, Raya Dunayevskaya, Daniel Gu√©rin, C. L. R. James, Rosa Luxemburg, Antonio Negri, Anton Pannekoek, Fredy Perlman, Ernesto Screpanti, E. P. Thompson, Raoul Vaneigem and Yanis Varoufakis, who claims that Marx himself was a libertarian Marxist. = Academic = V. Gordon Childe, an Australian archaeologist and one of the 20th century's most prominent Marxist academics According to a 2007 survey of American professors by Neil Gross and Solon Simmons, 17.6% of social science professors and 5.0% of humanities professors identify as Marxists, while between 0 and 2% of professors in all other disciplines identify as Marxists. = Archeology = The theoretical development of Marxist archaeology was first developed in the Soviet Union in 1929, when a young archaeologist named Vladislav I. Ravdonikas published a report entitled \\"For a Soviet history of material culture\\". Within this work, the very discipline of archaeology as it then stood was criticised as being inherently bourgeois, therefore anti-socialist and so, as a part of the academic reforms instituted in the Soviet Union under the administration of Premier Joseph Stalin, a great emphasis was placed on the adoption of Marxist archaeology throughout the country.Trigger 2007. pp. 326‚Äì40. These theoretical developments were subsequently adopted by archaeologists working in capitalist states outside of the Leninist bloc, most notably by the Australian academic V. Gordon Childe, who used Marxist theory in his understandings of the development of human society.Green 1981. p. 79. = Sociology = Marxist sociology, as the study of sociology from a Marxist perspective,Johnson, Allan G. 2000. The Blackwell dictionary of sociology: a user's guide to sociological language, Wiley-Blackwell. , pp. 183-84. is \\"a form of conflict theory associated with [...] Marxism's objective of developing a positive (empirical) science of capitalist society as part of the mobilization of a revolutionary working class\\".\\"Marxist Sociology.\\" Encyclopedia of Sociology. Macmillan Reference. 2006. The American Sociological Association has a section dedicated to the issues of Marxist sociology that is \\"interested in examining how insights from Marxist methodology and Marxist analysis can help explain the complex dynamics of modern society\\".About the Section on Marxist Sociology Influenced by the thought of Karl Marx, Marxist sociology emerged in the late 19th and early 20th century. As well as Marx, Max Weber and √âmile Durkheim are considered seminal influences in early sociology. The first Marxist school of sociology was known as Austro-Marxism, of which Carl Gr√ºnberg and Antonio Labriola were among its most notable members. During the 1940s, the Western Marxist school became accepted within Western academia, subsequently fracturing into several different perspectives such as the Frankfurt School or critical theory. Due to its former state-supported position, there has been a backlash against Marxist thought in post-communist states (see sociology in Poland) but it remains dominant in the sociological research sanctioned and supported by those communist states that remain (see sociology in China). = Economics = Marxian economics is a school of economic thought tracing its foundations to the critique of classical political economy first expounded upon by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. Marxian economics concerns itself with the analysis of crisis in capitalism, the role and distribution of the surplus product and surplus value in various types of economic systems, the nature and origin of economic value, the impact of class and class struggle on economic and political processes, and the process of economic evolution. Although the Marxian school is considered heterodox, ideas that have come out of Marxian economics have contributed to mainstream understanding of the global economy. Certain concepts of Marxian economics, especially those related to capital accumulation and the business cycle such as creative destruction have been fitted for use in capitalist systems. = Historiography = Marxist historiography is a school of historiography influenced by Marxism, the chief tenets of which are the centrality of social class and economic constraints in determining historical outcomes. Marxist historiography has made contributions to the history of the working class, oppressed nationalities, and the methodology of history from below. Friedrich Engels' most important historical contribution was Der deutsche Bauernkrieg about the German Peasants' War which analysed social warfare in early Protestant Germany in terms of emerging capitalist classes. The German Peasants' War indicate the Marxist interest in history from below and class analysis, and attempts a dialectical analysis. Engels' short treatise The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844 was salient in creating the socialist impetus in British politics. Marx's most important works on social and political history include The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon, The Communist Manifesto, The German Ideology, and those chapters of Das Kapital dealing with the historical emergence of capitalists and proletarians from pre-industrial English society. Marxist historiography suffered in the Soviet Union, as the government requested overdetermined historical writing. Notable histories include the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), published in the 1930s to justify the nature of Bolshevik party life under Joseph Stalin. A circle of historians inside the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) formed in 1946. While some members of the group, most notably Christopher Hill and E. P. Thompson, left the CPGB after the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, the common points of British Marxist historiography continued in their works. Thompson's The Making of the English Working Class is one of the works commonly associated with this group. Eric Hobsbawm's Bandits is another example of this group's work. C. L. R. James was also a great pioneer of the 'history from below' approach. Living in Britain when he wrote his most notable work The Black Jacobins (1938), he was an anti-Stalinist Marxist and so outside of the CPGB. In India, B. N. Datta and D. D. Kosambi are considered the founding fathers of Marxist historiography. Today, the senior-most scholars of Marxist historiography are R. S. Sharma, Irfan Habib, Romila Thapar, D. N. Jha and K. N. Panikkar, most of whom are now over 75 years old.Bottomore, T. B. 1983. A Dictionary of Marxist thought. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press. = Literary criticism = Marxist literary criticism is a loose term describing literary criticism based on socialist and dialectic theories. Marxist criticism views literary works as reflections of the social institutions from which they originate. According to Marxists, even literature itself is a social institution and has a specific ideological function, based on the background and ideology of the author. Notable marxist literary critics include Mikhail Bakhtin, Walter Benjamin, Terry Eagleton and Fredric Jameson. = Aesthetics = Marxist aesthetics is a theory of aesthetics based on, or derived from, the theories of Karl Marx. It involves a dialectical and materialist, or dialectical materialist, approach to the application of Marxism to the cultural sphere, specifically areas related to taste such as art and beauty, among others. Marxists believe that economic and social conditions, and especially the class relations that derive from them, affect every aspect of an individual's life, from religious beliefs to legal systems to cultural frameworks. Some notable Marxist aestheticians include Anatoly Lunacharsky, Mikhail Lifshitz, William Morris, Theodor W. Adorno, Bertolt Brecht, Herbert Marcuse, Walter Benjamin, Antonio Gramsci, Georg Luk√°cs, Ernst Fischer, Louis Althusser, Jacques Ranci√®re, Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Raymond Williams.  History  = Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels = Friedrich Engels Marx addressed the matters of alienation and exploitation of the working class, the capitalist mode of production and historical materialism. He is famous for analysing history in terms of class struggle, summarised in the initial line introducing The Communist Manifesto (1848): \\"The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles\\".The Communist Manifesto (1847). Chapter one. Together with Marx, Engels co-developed communist theory. Marx and Engels first met in September 1844. Discovering that they had similar views of philosophy and socialism, they collaborated and wrote works such as Die heilige Familie (The Holy Family). After Marx was deported from France in January 1845, they moved to Belgium, which then permitted greater freedom of expression than other European countries. In January 1846, they returned to Brussels to establish the Communist Correspondence Committee. In 1847, they began writing The Communist Manifesto (1848), based on Engels' The Principles of Communism. Six weeks later, they published the 12,000-word pamphlet in February 1848. In March, Belgium expelled them and they moved to Cologne, where they published the Neue Rheinische Zeitung, a politically radical newspaper. By 1849, they had to leave Cologne for London. The Prussian authorities pressured the British government to expel Marx and Engels, but Prime Minister Lord John Russell refused. After Marx's death in 1883, Engels became the editor and translator of Marx's writings. With his Origins of the Family, Private Property, and the State (1884)‚Äîanalysing monogamous marriage as guaranteeing male social domination of women, a concept analogous, in communist theory, to the capitalist class's economic domination of the working class‚ÄîEngels made intellectually significant contributions to feminist theory and Marxist feminism. = Russian Revolution and the Soviet Union = Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin With the October Revolution in 1917 the Bolsheviks took power from the Russian Provisional Government. The Bolsheviks established the first socialist state based on the ideas of soviet democracy and Leninism. Their newly formed federal state promised to end Russian involvement in World War I and establish a revolutionary worker's state. Following the October Revolution the Soviet government was involved in a struggle with the White Movement and several independence movements in the Russian Civil War. This period is marked by the establishment of many socialist policies and the development of new socialist ideas mainly in the form of Marxism‚ÄìLeninism. In 1919, the nascent Soviet Government established the Communist Academy and the Marx‚ÄìEngels‚ÄìLenin Institute for doctrinal Marxist study as well as to publish official ideological and research documents for the Russian Communist Party. With Lenin's death in 1924, there was an internal struggle in the Soviet Communist movement, mainly between Joseph Stalin and Leon Trotsky in the form of the Right Opposition and Left Opposition respectively. These struggles were based on both sides different interpretations of Marxist and Leninist theory based on the situation of the Soviet Union at the time.History.com Staff (2020) [2009]. \\"Russian Revolution\\". History.com. A&E; Television Networks. Retrieved 11 July 2020McMeekin, Sean (2017). The Russian Revolution: A New History. Basic Books. . = Chinese Revolution = At the end of the Second Sino- Japanese War and more widely World War II, the Chinese Communist Revolution took place within the context of the Chinese Civil War. The Chinese Communist Party, which was founded in 1921, was in conflict with the Kuomintang over the future of the country. Throughout the Civil War Mao Zedong developed a theory of Marxism for the Chinese historical context. Mao found a large base of support in the peasantry as opposed to the Russian Revolution which found its primary support in the urban centers of the Russian Empire. Some major ideas contributed by Mao were the ideas of New Democracy, mass line and people's war. The People's Republic of China (PRC) was declared in 1949. The new socialist state was to be founded on the ideas of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin. Franke, Wolfgang, A Century of Chinese Revolution, 1851‚Äì1949 (Basil Blackwell, Oxford, 1970).Ellison, Herbert J., ed. The Sino-Soviet Conflict: A Global Perspective (1982) online From Stalin's death until the late 1960s, there was increasing conflict between China and the Soviet Union. De- Stalinization, which first began under Nikita Khrushchev and the policy of detente, were seen as revisionist and insufficiently Marxist. This ideological confrontation spilled into a wider global crisis centered around which nation was to lead the international socialist movement. Following Mao's death and the ascendancy of Deng Xiaoping, Maoism and official Marxism in China was reworked. This new model was to be a newer dynamic form of Marxism‚ÄìLeninism and Maoism in China. Commonly referred to as socialism with Chinese Characteristics this new path was centered around Deng's Four Cardinal Principles which sought to uphold the central role of the Chinese Communist Party and uphold the principle that China was in the primary stage of socialism and that it was still working to build a communist society based on Marxist principles. = Late 20th century = Fidel Castro at the United Nations General Assembly in 1960 In 1959, the Cuban Revolution led to the victory of Fidel Castro and his July 26 Movement. Although the revolution was not explicitly socialist, upon victory Castro ascended to the position of prime minister and adopted the Leninist model of socialist development, forging an alliance with the Soviet Union.Bourne 1986.Coltman 2003. One of the leaders of the revolution, the Argentine Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara, subsequently went on to aid revolutionary socialist movements in Congo- Kinshasa and Bolivia, eventually being killed by the Bolivian government, possibly on the orders of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), although the CIA agent sent to search for Guevara, Felix Rodriguez, expressed a desire to keep him alive as a possible bargaining tool with the Cuban government. He posthumously went on to become an internationally recognised icon. In the People's Republic of China, the Maoist government undertook the Cultural Revolution from 1966 through to 1976 to purge Chinese society of capitalist elements and achieve socialism. However, upon Mao Zedong's death, his rivals seized political power and under the premiership of Deng Xiaoping, many of Mao's Cultural Revolution era policies were revised or abandoned and much of the state sector privatised. The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the collapse of most of those socialist states that had professed a Marxist‚ÄìLeninist ideology. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the emergence of the New Right and neoliberal capitalism as the dominant ideological trends in Western politics‚Äîchampioned by American President Ronald Reagan and British prime minister Margaret Thatcher‚Äîled the west to take a more aggressive stand towards the Soviet Union and its Leninist allies. Meanwhile, the reformist Mikhael Gorbachev became Premier of the Soviet Union in March 1985 and sought to abandon Leninist models of development towards social democracy. Ultimately, Gorbachev's reforms, coupled with rising levels of popular ethnic nationalism in the Soviet Union, led to the state's dissolution in late 1991 into a series of constituent nations, all of which abandoned Marxist‚ÄìLeninist models for socialism, with most converting to capitalist economies.D'Encausse, Helene Carrere. 1993. \\"The End of the Soviet Empire: The Triumph of the Nations,\\" translated by F. Philip. New York: The New Republic. . p. 16. = 21st century = Hugo Chavez casting a vote in 2007 At the turn of the 21st century, China, Cuba, Laos, North Korea and Vietnam remained the only officially Marxist‚ÄìLeninist states remaining, although a Maoist government led by Prachanda was elected into power in Nepal in 2008 following a long guerrilla struggle. The early 21st century also saw the election of socialist governments in several Latin American nations, in what has come to be known as the \\"pink tide\\". Dominated by the Venezuelan government of Hugo Ch√°vez, this trend also saw the election of Evo Morales in Bolivia, Rafael Correa in Ecuador and Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua. Forging political and economic alliances through international organisations like the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas, these socialist governments allied themselves with Marxist‚ÄìLeninist Cuba and although none of them espoused a Leninist path directly, most admitted to being significantly influenced by Marxist theory. For Italian Marxist Gianni Vattimo and Santiago Zabala in their 2011 book Hermeneutic Communism, \\"this new weak communism differs substantially from its previous Soviet (and current Chinese) realization, because the South American countries follow democratic electoral procedures and also manage to decentralize the state bureaucratic system through the Bolivarian missions. In sum, if weakened communism is felt as a specter in the West, it is not only because of media distortions but also for the alternative it represents through the same democratic procedures that the West constantly professes to cherish but is hesitant to apply\\".Gianni Vattimo and Santiago Zabala. Hermeneutic Communism: From Heidegger to Marx Columbia University Press. 2011. p. 122 Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China since 2012 Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping has announced a deepening commitment of the Communist Party of China to the ideas of Marx. At an event celebrating the 200th anniversary of Marx's birth, Xi said \\"We must win the advantages, win the initiative, and win the future. We must continuously improve the ability to use Marxism to analyse and solve practical problems\\", adding that Marxism is a \\"powerful ideological weapon for us to understand the world, grasp the law, seek the truth, and change the world\\". Xi has further stressed the importance of examining and continuing the tradition of the CPC and embrace its revolutionary past. The fidelity of those varied revolutionaries, leaders and parties to the work of Karl Marx is highly contested and has been rejected by many Marxists and other socialists alike. Socialists in general and socialist writers, including Dimitri Volkogonov, acknowledge that the actions of authoritarian socialist leaders have damaged \\"the enormous appeal of socialism generated by the October Revolution\\".Volkogonov, Dimitri (1991). Stalin: Triumph and Tragedy. Translated by Harold Shukman. London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson. p. 173. .  Criticism  Criticism of Marxism has come from various political ideologies and academic disciplines. This includes general criticism about lack of internal consistency, criticisms related to historical materialism, that it is a type of historical determinism, the necessity of suppression of individual rights, issues with the implementation of communism and economic issues such as the distortion or absence of price signals and reduced incentives. In addition, empirical and epistemological problems are frequently identified.Howard, M. C., and J. E. King. 1992. A History of Marxian Economics: Volume II, 1929‚Äì1990. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press.Keynes, John Maynard. 1991. Essays in Persuasion. W. W. Norton & Company. p. 300. Some Marxists have criticised the academic institutionalisation of Marxism for being too shallow and detached from political action. Zimbabwean Trotskyist Alex Callinicos, himself a professional academic, stated:Callinicos 2010. p. 12. > Its practitioners remind one of Narcissus, who in the Greek legend fell in > love with his own reflection. [...] Sometimes it is necessary to devote time > to clarifying and developing the concepts that we use, but indeed for > Western Marxists this has become an end in itself. The result is a body of > writings incomprehensible to all but a tiny minority of highly qualified > scholars. Additionally, there are intellectual critiques of Marxism that contest certain assumptions prevalent in Marx's thought and Marxism after him, without exactly rejecting Marxist politics. Other contemporary supporters of Marxism argue that many aspects of Marxist thought are viable, but that the corpus is incomplete or outdated in regards to certain aspects of economic, political or social theory. They may combine some Marxist concepts with the ideas of other theorists such as Max Weber‚Äîthe Frankfurt School is one example.Held, David (1980), p. 16. = General = Philosopher and historian of ideas Leszek Ko≈Çakowski pointed out that \\"Marx's theory is incomplete or ambiguous in many places, and could be 'applied' in many contradictory ways without manifestly infringing its principles\\". Specifically, he considers \\"the laws of dialectics\\" as fundamentally erroneous, stating that some are \\"truisms with no specific Marxist content\\", others \\"philosophical dogmas that cannot be proved by scientific means\\" and some just \\"nonsense\\". He believes that some Marxist laws can be interpreted differently, but that these interpretations still in general fall into one of the two categories of error. Okishio's theorem shows that if capitalists use cost-cutting techniques and real wages do not increase, the rate of profit must rise, which casts doubt on Marx's view that the rate of profit would tend to fall.M. C. Howard and J. E. King. (1992) A History of Marxian Economics: Volume II, 1929‚Äì1990, chapter 7, sects. II‚ÄìIV. Princeton, NJ: Princeton Univ. Press. The allegations of inconsistency have been a large part of Marxian economics and the debates around it since the 1970s.See M. C. Howard and J. E. King, 1992, A History of Marxian Economics: Volume II, 1929‚Äì1990. Princeton, NJ: Princeton Univ. Press. Andrew Kliman argues that this undermines Marx's critiques and the correction of the alleged inconsistencies, because internally inconsistent theories cannot be right by definition.Kliman states that \\"Marx‚Äôs value theory would be necessarily wrong if it were internally inconsistent. Internally inconsistent theories may be appealing, intuitively plausible and even obvious, and consistent with all available empirical evidence‚Äì‚Äìbut they cannot be right. It is necessary to reject them or correct them. Thus the alleged proofs of inconsistency trump all other considerations, disqualifying Marx‚Äôs theory at the starting gate. By doing so, they provide the principal justification for the suppression of this theory as well as the suppression of, and the denial of resources needed to carry out, present-day research based upon it. This greatly inhibits its further development. So does the very charge of inconsistency. What person of intellectual integrity would want to join a research program founded on (what he believes to be) a theory that is internally inconsistent and therefore false?\\" (Andrew Kliman, Reclaiming Marx's \\"Capital\\": A Refutation of the Myth of Inconsistency, Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, 2007, p. 3, emphasis in original). However, in his book, Kliman presents an interpretation where these inconsistencies can be eliminated. The connection between the inconsistency allegations and the lack of study of Marx‚Äôs theories was argued further by John Cassidy (\\"The Return of Karl Marx,\\" The New Yorker, 20 & 27 Oct. 1997, p. 252): \\"His mathematical model of the economy, which depended on the idea that labor is the source of all value, was riven with internal inconsistencies and is rarely studied these days.\\" = Epistemological and empirical = Marx's predictions have been criticized because they have allegedly failed, with some pointing towards the GDP per capita increasing generally in capitalist economies compared to less market oriented economics, the capitalist economies not suffering worsening economic crises leading to the overthrow of the capitalist system and communist revolutions not occurring in the most advanced capitalist nations, but instead in undeveloped regions.Andrew Kliman, Reclaiming Marx's \\"Capital\\", Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, p. 208, emphases in original. In his books The Poverty of Historicism and Conjectures and Refutations, philosopher of science Karl Popper criticized the explanatory power and validity of historical materialism. Popper believed that Marxism had been initially scientific, in that Marx had postulated a genuinely predictive theory. When these predictions were not in fact borne out, Popper argues that the theory avoided falsification by the addition of ad hoc hypotheses that made it compatible with the facts. Because of this, Popper asserted, a theory that was initially genuinely scientific degenerated into pseudoscientific dogma. = Socialist = Democratic socialists and social democrats reject the idea that socialism can be accomplished only through extra-legal class conflict and a proletarian revolution. The relationship between Marx and other socialist thinkers and organizations‚Äîrooted in Marxism's \\"scientific\\" and anti-utopian socialism, among other factors‚Äîhas divided Marxists from other socialists since Marx's life. After Marx's death and with the emergence of Marxism, there have also been dissensions within Marxism itself‚Äîa notable example is the splitting of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party into Bolsheviks and Mensheviks. Orthodox Marxists became opposed to a less dogmatic, more innovative, or even revisionist Marxism. = Anarchist and libertarian = Anarchism has had a strained relationship with Marxism since Marx's life. Anarchists and many non-Marxist libertarian socialists reject the need for a transitory state phase, claiming that socialism can only be established through decentralized, non-coercive organization. Anarchist Mikhail Bakunin criticized Marx for his authoritarian bent. The phrases \\"barracks socialism\\" or \\"barracks communism\\" became a shorthand for this critique, evoking the image of citizens' lives being as regimented as the lives of conscripts in a barracks. Noam Chomsky is critical of Marxism's dogmatic strains and the idea of Marxism itself, but still appreciates Marx's contributions to political thought. Unlike some anarchists, Chomsky does not consider Bolshevism \\"Marxism in practice\\", but he does recognize that Marx was a complicated figure who had conflicting ideas. While acknowledging the latent authoritarianism in Marx, Chomsky also points to the libertarian strains that developed into the council communism of Rosa Luxemburg and Anton Pannekoek. However, his commitment to libertarian socialism has led him to characterize himself as an anarchist with radical Marxist leanings (see the political positions of Noam Chomsky). = Economic = Other critiques come from an economic standpoint. Vladimir Karpovich Dmitriev writing in 1898,V. K. Dmitriev, 1974 (1898), Economic Essays on Value, Competition and Utility. Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz writing in 1906‚Äì1907Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz, 1952 (1906‚Äì1907), \\"Value and Price in the Marxian System\\", International Economic Papers 2, 5‚Äì60; Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz, 1984 (1907), \\"On the Correction of Marx's Fundamental Theoretical Construction in the Third Volume of Capital\\". In Eugen von B√∂hm-Bawerk 1984 (1896), Karl Marx and the Close of his System, Philadelphia: Orion Editions. and subsequent critics have alleged that Marx's value theory and law of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall are internally inconsistent. In other words, the critics allege that Marx drew conclusions that actually do not follow from his theoretical premises. Once these alleged errors are corrected, his conclusion that aggregate price and profit are determined by and equal to aggregate value and surplus value no longer holds true. This result calls into question his theory that the exploitation of workers is the sole source of profit.M. C. Howard and J. E. King. (1992) A History of Marxian Economics: Volume II, 1929‚Äì1990, chapter 12, sect. III. Princeton, NJ: Princeton Univ. Press. Both Marxism and socialism have received considerable critical analysis from multiple generations of Austrian economists in terms of scientific methodology, economic theory and political implications. During the marginal revolution, subjective value theory was rediscovered by Carl Menger, a development that fundamentally undermined the British cost theories of value. The restoration of subjectivism and praxeological methodology previously used by classical economists including Richard Cantillon, Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, Jean-Baptiste Say and Fr√©d√©ric Bastiat led Menger to criticise historicist methodology in general. Second-generation Austrian economist Eugen B√∂hm von Bawerk used praxeological and subjectivist methodology to attack the law of value fundamentally. Gottfried Haberler has regarded his criticism as \\"definitive\\", arguing that B√∂hm-Bawerk's critique of Marx's economics was so \\"thorough and devastating\\" that he believes that as of the 1960s no Marxian scholar had conclusively refuted it. Third-generation Austrian Ludwig von Mises rekindled debate about the economic calculation problem by arguing that without price signals in capital goods, in his opinion all other aspects of the market economy are irrational. This led him to declare that \\"rational economic activity is impossible in a socialist commonwealth\\". Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson argue that Marx's economic theory was fundamentally flawed because it attempted to simplify the economy into a few general laws that ignored the impact of institutions on the economy.

Functional or purely decorative fasteners of silk cord with metal tips popular in the 16th and early 17th centuries, sometimes of gold set with gemstones or enameled, are generally called \\"aiglets\\", \\"aglets\\" or \\"points\\". In modern usage, an \\"aiguillette\\" is an ornamental braided cord with decorative metal tips worn on uniforms or as part of other costumes such as academic dress, where it will denote an honour. This usage of \\"aiguillette\\" derives from lacing used to fasten plate armor together. As such, a knot or loop arrangement was used which sometimes hung from the shoulder. These aiguillettes should not be confused with lanyards, which are cords also worn from the shoulder (or around the neck), but do not have the pointed aiguillette tips and are usually of fibre rather than gold or silver wire, and often not braided. The modern aglet or shoelace tip and the decorative tips on bolo ties are types of aiguillettes. History Portraits of the 16th and 17th centuries show that aiglets or metal tips could be functional or purely decorative, though many were used to \\"close\\" seams and slashes that are not always apparent on dark garments in portraits. They were made in matched sets, might be of silver, silver-gilt, or gold, and were worn in masses. A 1547 inventory of Henry VIII of England's wardrobe includes one coat with 12 pairs of aiglets, and 11 gowns with a total of 367 pairs. The Day Book of the Wardrobe of Robes of Elizabeth I records items received into storage, including details of buttons and aiglets lost from the Queen's clothing. This entry suggests the huge numbers of matching aiglets fashionable forty years later: > Lost the 2 of February ...

In Scotland, they were known as \\"horns\\", Mary, Queen of Scots had pairs of gold horns enamelled in red and white and set with pearls.Thomas Thomson, Collection of Inventories (Edinburgh, 1815), p. 278. Those of Anne of Denmark in the early years of the 17th century were larger, shaped in triangles and pyramids.

The modern aiguillette derives from the laces used to secure plates of armor together‚Äîthe breast- and back- plates would be attached on one side with short loops of cord acting as a hinge, and on the other by a longer and more ornate tied one, to support the arm defences. The ensuing knots would hang down the shoulder. (As with combat boots, the longer the lace, the less the need to undo the entire lace.) As armour became more ornamental and less practical, so too did the ties. This would also explain the aiguillettes of varying levels of complexity in the uniforms of the Household Cavalry (see picture above), as opposed to other \\"unarmored\\" troops. A version that says that aiguillettes originated in aides- de-camp and adjutants wearing a pencil at the end of a cord hanging from the shoulder has no historical base. = Argentina = Aiguillettes are worn on the right shoulder by armed forces officers serving in specific positions, such as aide-de-camp to the President, the Minister of Defense, each service's chief of staff and unit commanding officers, and by military attach√©s to Argentinian embassies abroad. The color of the aiguillette may be golden, silver or tan, depending the nature of the assignment. Olive green aiguillettes are worn with the combat uniform in very special circumstances, such as ceremonies and inspections. Otherwise, aiguillettes are not worn with the combat uniform. A special red aiguillette is worn by the adjutants to the commanding officers of the Horse Grenadiers Regiment (the presidential guard) and the Military Academy. Also, a red aiguillette is worn on the left shoulder by the senior NCO of each Army unit. A thinner, yellow aiguillette is worn on the right shoulder by NCOs who have completed the instructor course. In the Navy, adjutants to very senior officers wear golden aiguillettes on the left shoulder. = Australia = Aiguillettes distinguish officers of Flag, General and Air rank in specific command appointments, military attach√©s and aides-de- camp. Most senior officers and aides-de-camp to the Governor-General or state governors wear the aiguillette on the right shoulder, whilst military attach√©s and staff aides-de-camp wear the aiguillette on the left. Royal aiguillettes are of plain gold, naval aiguillettes are of blue and gold, army aiguillettes are of red and gold, air force aiguillettes of light blue and gold. The Governor-General of Australia, as the Commander in Chief of the Australian Defence Force, is entitled to wear a uniform on which an aiguillette made of platinum is worn. = Canada = Aiguillettes with shoulder boards are worn by military aides-de-camp to the Governor General. The aiguillette is gold with brass tags and worn on the right shoulder. Aides-de-camp to the provincial lieutenant governors wear the same gold-pattern aiguillette on the right shoulder, but do not wear shoulder boards. Aiguillettes are worn on the left shoulder by aides-de-camp to generals, flag officers and diplomats. Aides-de- camp assigned to the Sovereign or officers holding a royal appointment wear the aiguillette on the right shoulder. Obsolete-style gold-braid aiguillettes mixed with army crimson, navy blue, or air force blue may also still be worn by aides-de-camp to lieutenant governors, flag and general officers and diplomats who still have them. =Denmark= Royal Danish Naval Band with red aiguillettes The Danish military uses aiguillettes for a number of different positions. * Blue and yellow: Danish troops stationed with UNFICYP * Blue and red: the Bugle Corps of the Guard Hussar Regiment Mounted Squadron * Red: Royal Danish Naval Band * Green: Danish military police * Gold: Adjutants =France= Republican Guard wearing a gold-wire aiguillette on the left shoulder The aiguillettes are worn only with the dress uniform.

Her mother's ancestors, some of whom helped found Windsor, Connecticut, in 1636, included Roger Wolcott, a colonial governor and judge, and Alexander Wolcott, leader of Connecticut's Republican party. Well educated, Juliette was tutored in Latin and other languages by her mother and young uncle, Alexander Wolcott, and briefly attended a boarding school in New Haven, Connecticut, and Emma Willard's school in Troy, New York. Wolcott, who had moved to Chicago in 1810, probably introduced Juliette to John H. Kinzie, son of fur trader John Kinzie.http://www.english.illinois.edu/-people-/emeritus/baym/essays/waubun.htm They married in 1830 and moved to Detroit and then Fort Winnebago, a new trading post at the crucial portage between the Fox and Wisconsin rivers. Her husband was an Indian sub-agent to the Ho-Chunk nation (Winnebago people), assigned to this area that connected the Great Lakes/St. Lawrence and Mississippi watersheds. After the treaty ending the Sauk War of 1832 forced the Winnebago to move west of the Mississippi River, the Kinzies left the area that would later become Wisconsin and in July 1833 moved to Chicago in the relatively new state of Illinois to join Kinzie's widowed mother and siblings. The Kinzie family was involved in Chicago's civic and social development throughout the 19th century. Active in the Episcopal church, Juliette Kinzie helped found St. James Church, now the oldest Episcopal congregation in the city, and since 1955 the cathedral for the Diocese of Chicago. The Kinzies also helped found St. Luke's Hospital and the Chicago Historical Society (now the Chicago History Museum). Kinzie died while vacationing in Amagansett, New York, Long Island, in 1870, after a druggist accidentally substituted morphine for the quinine she ordered.http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/articles/pages/4690/Kinzie-Juliette- Augusta-Magill-1806-1870.html Literary works Members of the Kinzie family, particularly her mother-in-law and sister-in-law, told Juliette about the Battle of Fort Dearborn at Chicago. Being Canadians, they were not attacked (it was during the War of 1812), and evacuated to Detroit. In 1844 Kinzie published Narrative of the Massacre at Chicago, August 15, 1812, and of Some Preceding Events, anonymously, but acknowledged authorship soon after publication. Her second book Wau-Bun: The \\"Early Day\\" in the North West,Wau- bun, the early day in the Northwest. by Mrs. John H. Kinzie extended her first book. It recounted her experiences at Fort Winnebago in the early 1830s, as well as those of her mother-in-law and other relatives during the Black Hawk War. The title reflects the local word for daybreak. Kinzie described her journeys back and forth to the early settlement of Chicago, and complex cultural encounters with a diverse frontier society. Unusual for its day, the book also described sympathetically and in detail the lives of Native Americans, who were being displaced by her extended family and other white settlers. An appendix included excerpts from the journals of relative Thomas Forsyth, who blamed the United States (rather than the Sauk) for starting the war.http://www.english.illinois.edu/-people-/emeritus/baym/essays/waubun.htm Published by Derby and Jackson in 1856, it was reprinted 19 times by the end of that century, and four more times in the 20th century.http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/articles/pages/4690/Kinzie-Juliette- Augusta-Magill-1806-1870.html At least one 20th century historian found it unduly romantic, and criticized it for exaggerating the importance of her relatives, particularly her father-in- law.http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/410079.html In 1869 her novel Walter Ogilby was published. Her Narrative... was reworked and released as Mark Logan, the Bourgeois in 1871 following her death. Family and legacy Juliette and John Kinzie had seven children, six of whom survived to adulthood. John Kinzie served as U.S. Army paymaster for Michigan, Wisconsin and Illinois troops in the Civil War and died of a heart attack on his way to a vacation shortly after President Lincoln's assassination. One son died fighting for the Union in the Civil War, two others were taken prisoner by Confederate forces but survived. Their daughter Eleanor (Nellie) married William Washington Gordon II, son of William Washington Gordon of Savannah, Georgia. In 1860, they named their second child after grandmother Juliette, and Juliette Gordon Low later founded Girl Scouting in America in 1912.http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h2893 Nellie also followed her mother's example by expressing outrage over the treatment of Native American heritage sites and monuments, and caused the National Society of the Colonial Dames of America in the State of Wisconsin to erect a new monument to Tomochichi (who had donated the land on which Savannah began) after the Central of Georgia Railway erected a monument to her father-in-law displacing a previous Tomochichi monument. The house in which the Kinzie family lived in what is now Portage, Wisconsin, as discussed in Wau-bun, is now known as the Old Indian Agency House. The National Society of the Colonial Dames of America in the State of Wisconsin, who own the house, restored and refurbished it in 1932 as their centennial project. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1972. References *Castagna, J. E. Kinzie, Juliette Augusta Magill. American National Biography Online, Feb. 2000.

Description This genus as a rule lacks pseudobulbs and consequently produces tufted fan-like growths of fairly erect narrow leaves, and conforms to the sympodial method of growth. Plants of this genus produce single- flowered inflorescences, with the flowers often being quite large for the size of the plant, and occurring at any time of the year, though slightly more concentrated during summer in cultivation. All members of this genus have their flowers dominated by the large labellum (lip) which often has longitudinal markings upon it which serve as a nectar guide for pollinating insects.

It was eventually replaced with a system based on the yen. Origins The ry≈ç was originally a unit of weight from China, the tael. It came into use in Japan during the Kamakura period. By the Azuchi‚ÄìMomoyama period it had become nearly uniform throughout Japan, about 4.4 monme as a unit of weight (about the same as 16.5 grams). During the Sengoku period, various local daimy≈ç began to mint their own money. One of the best known and most prestigious of these private coins was the koshukin issued by the warlord Takeda Shingen, who had substantial gold deposits within his territories. The value of the koshukin was based on its weight, with one koshukin equal to one ry≈ç of gold, and thus stamped with its weight (about 15 grams). During the Tensh≈ç period (1573‚Äì1592), one ry≈ç was equal to four koku of rice, or 1000 brass coins. Tokugawa period The Tokugawa shogunate attempted to create a central currency, based on gold, silver and copper units all exchangeable at fixed rates. Oblong gold coins, called koban, were minted with one koban containing about one ry≈ç of gold, so that koban carried a face value of one ry≈ç. The official rate was set in 1609 at one ry≈ç equal to 50 monme (approx 187 grams) of silver, or 4000 brass coins. However, in reality the relative values between gold, silver and brass currencies fluctuated on an almost daily basis throughout the Edo period. In 1695 the government decided to increase the amount of metal money in circulation by debasement. As a result, the ry≈ç as a unit of weight of gold and the ry≈ç as the face value of the koban were no longer synonymous. The Keich≈ç koban issued after the monetary reform of May 1601 offered approximately 17.9 grams gold with fineness of 84‚Äì87%. The Genroku koban issued in 1695 still weighed around 17.9 grams; however its gold content was reduced to 57%. The H≈çei koban of 1706 returned to the original fineness; however, the size was much reduced and it had little more than half the metal value of the Keich≈ç koban. In 1700 the official exchange rate was adjusted to 1 ry≈ç equal to 60 monme silver (225 grams) or 4000 brass coins. Tokugawa Yoshimune further conducted a reform to stimulate the economy and raise prices in 1736, again lowering the gold content of the koban. One ry≈ç was also considered equivalent to 1 koku of rice, or the amount of rice needed to feed one person for one year, although this was a less exact standard, which fluctuated depending on the abundance of the rice crop in any particular year. On June 27, 1871, with the introduction of currency reforms after the Meiji Restoration, the ry≈ç was abolished, and replaced one-for-one with the Yen. Modern conversion These fluctuations in the gold content of the koban over time, as well as differences in the cost of living between various points in the Edo period and in modern times make any attempt to relate the value of one ry≈ç in terms of modern currency very difficult. Japanese middle school textbooks often state that one ry≈ç was approximately equivalent to 100,000 Yen at the start of the Edo period, and around 3000‚Äì4000 yen at the end of the Edo period. On the other hand, the Currency Museum of the Bank of Japan states that one ry≈ç had a nominal value equivalent 300,000‚Äì400,000 yen, but was worth only 120,000‚Äì130,000 yen in practice, or 40,000 yen in terms of rice.

The name \\"H√§rtel\\" was added when Gottfried Christoph H√§rtel took over the company in 1795. In 1807, H√§rtel began to manufacture pianos, an endeavour which lasted until 1870. The Breitkopf pianos were highly esteemed in the 19th century by pianists like Franz Liszt and Clara Schumann. In the 19th century the company was for many years the publisher of the Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung, an influential music journal. The company has consistently supported contemporary composers and had close editorial collaboration with Beethoven, Haydn, Mendelssohn, Schumann, Chopin, Liszt, Wagner and Brahms. In the 19th century they also published the first \\"complete works\\" editions of various composers, for instance Bach (the Bach-Gesellschaft edition), Mozart (the Alte Mozart- Ausgabe), and Schubert (the Franz Schubert's Werke).

In 1993, she became the first (and so far only) female jockey to win a Triple Crown race when she captured the Belmont Stakes aboard Colonial Affair. In 2000, she became the first woman inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame, and in 2003 became the first female jockey to win a Breeders' Cup race. She has also been honored by induction into the National Women's Hall of Fame and Cowgirl Hall of Fame. Riding career After spending her childhood as an accomplished show horse rider at competitions in western Michigan, Krone was inspired by the career of Steve Cauthen to become a professional Thoroughbred jockey. She made her debut as a jockey on Jan. 30, 1981, at Tampa Bay Downs in Florida, on a horse named Tiny Star. She won her first race on Feb. 12, 1981, also at Tampa Bay Downs, aboard Lord Farkle. Within a few years, her success made her a well-known racing personality. Krone was the only woman to win riding championships at Belmont Park, Gulfstream Park, Monmouth Park, The Meadowlands and Atlantic City Race Course. She would go on to make appearances on The Late Show with David Letterman, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, and appear on the cover of Sports Illustrated for the issue of May 22, 1989, one of only eight jockeys so recognized (the others are Willie Shoemaker, Bill Hartack, Eddie Arcaro, Johnny Longden, John Sellers, Robyn Smith and Steve Cauthen). In 1993 she received an ESPY Award as Female Athlete of the Year. Krone retired for the first time on April 18, 1999, with a three-winner day at Lone Star Park, near Dallas. She embarked upon a broadcasting career in horse racing. From 1999‚Äì2000 she worked as an analyst for TVG Network, then worked as a paddock analyst for Hollywood Park from 1999‚Äì2002. She came out of retirement at Santa Anita Park in November 2002. After a good start to the 2003 season, she fractured two bones in her lower back and spent the next four months recovering. She returned to lead the 2003 Del Mar jockeys in purse earnings, then went on to become the first woman jockey to win a Breeders' Cup race when she rode Halfbridled to victory in the 2003 Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies at Santa Anita. On December 12, 2003, just weeks after her Breeders' Cup win, she broke several ribs and suffered severe muscle tears in a fall at Hollywood Park Racetrack. Though not fully recovered from her injuries, Krone attempted to come back on February 14, 2004, at Santa Anita Park but failed to win in three races. She did not ride again; on July 8 of that year, she made a statement in which she did not officially retire, but strongly hinted that she would never race again. Because of her success in the face of severe injuries sustained while racing, Krone was named by USA Today as one of the 10 Toughest Athletes and was honored with the Wilma Rudolph Courage Award by the Women's Sports Foundation. Krone also had been inducted into the Cowgirl Hall of Fame in Fort Worth, Texas, and is a member of the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame. In October 2013 she was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame in Seneca Falls, N.Y. In 2018 a bronze statue of her was given to the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame. Personal life Krone in 2006 In 2001 Krone married Jay Hovdey, executive columnist for the Daily Racing Form. She gave birth to their daughter Lorelei Judith Krone in 2005. (Hovdey also has a son, Ed, from his previous marriage.) Her mother, Judi Krone, was an accomplished equestrian who died a few days before Christmas of 1999. Since her second retirement from racing, Krone has focused on parenting and worked as a racing broadcaster, motivational speaker, and an instructor of natural horsemanship. Krone rode in one sanctioned betting race at Santa Anita Park on October 18, 2008, competing against seven other retired Hall of Fame jockeys: Gary Stevens, Pat Day, Chris McCarron, Jerry Bailey, √Ångel Cordero, Jacinto V√°squez and Sandy Hawley.

It stars Robert Ginty as the Vietnam War veteran John Eastland, also known as \\"The Exterminator\\". When a group of thugs paralyze his friend, Eastland becomes a vigilante; embarking on a mission to cleanse New York of organized crime. The film also stars Samantha Eggar, Christopher George and Steve James. It has gained a cult following since its release.  Plot  During a firefight in Vietnam, U.S. soldiers John Eastland and his best friend, Michael Jefferson, are captured by the Viet Cong. They are tied to wooden stakes with several other men, and tortured for information. When Eastland refuses to answer, the VC commander decapitates the soldier beside him with a machete. Jefferson escapes moments later, kills the remaining VC soldiers, and unties Eastland. Eastland then kills the VC commander. The film then shifts to New York, where Eastland and Jefferson work in a warehouse. One day, Eastland catches a group of thugs, called the Ghetto Ghouls, trying to steal beer. He is attacked, but Jefferson comes to his aid. They defeat them, but the gang return to cripple Jefferson, gouging his spine with a meat hook. Eastland, after this incident, captures and interrogates one of the gang members with a flamethrower. He then attacks the gang's base of operations with his rifle, shooting one gang member and leaving two others tied up in a basement (also shooting one of them afterwards), which is full of hungry rats. Eastland's vigilante justice doesn't end there. The warehouse where he works has been forced into paying protection money. Gino Pontivini, the mob boss behind the scheme, has even taxed the workers' paychecks. Eastland kidnaps Pontivini, and chains him above an industrial meat grinder. Eastland then demands information to get to Pontivini's safe, which Pontivini reluctantly gives. Eastland barely survives an attack by Pontivini's Dobermann, so upon returning, he lowers Pontivini into the grinder for lying about the dog. Jefferson and his family are given Pontivini's money to help pay their bills. Detective James Dalton begins investigating the attacks, while the press dub Eastland the \\"Exterminator\\". Meanwhile, Eastland kills the ring leader of a child prostitution ring, as well as a state senator from New Jersey who sexually abuses children. He also kills three more members of the Ghetto Ghouls (one of which being the gang member he interrogated earlier), after witnessing them rob an elderly woman. Meanwhile, the CIA has heard of the Exterminator and reaches an odd conclusion. Based on the current administration's promise to cut down crime rates, they believe the Exterminator is either an opposition party's stunt, or a foreign power's ruse to humiliate the current administration; by exposing their inability to handle the city's crime problem. They monitor Dalton's investigation of the Exterminator. Dalton, working from a bootprint found at Pontivini's home, discovers the Exterminator wears hunting boots manufactured by a mail order firm in Maine. Asking them for a list of clients in New York, and following the hunch that the Exterminator may be a Vietnam War veteran; since he killed the Ghetto Ghouls with an M16 rifle, Dalton has narrowed his suspects accordingly. Eastland visits Jefferson in the hospital, and because he will never be able to walk again, Jefferson asks Eastland to kill him. Eastland does, but coincidentally, Dalton is visiting the hospital at the same time. When he learns about Jefferson's death, Dalton surmises that one of Jefferson's friends was the Exterminator, and learns that one of his suspects, Eastland, was Jefferson's closest friend. Eastland is aware that Dalton is staking out his apartment, so he arranges a private meeting with him, where he hopes to explain why he became a vigilante. However, the CIA are aware of the rendezvous after bugging Eastland's phone. They ambush him at his meeting with Dalton, which results in Dalton being killed while helping Eastland escape. =Alternate ending= In some releases Eastland survived the CIA ambush, whereas in others he is killed alongside Dalton.Anchor Bay Entertainment's Director's Cut release liner notes based on James Glickenhaus' own words.

During the Second World War its activities were suspended by the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act 1939. In 1946 the group returned to the stage in a production of Agatha Christie's Ten Little Niggers (using the original title). In 1963 the Society toured the major churches of South East England culminating in two nights at St Paul‚Äôs in Covent Garden and St Matthew‚Äôs in Slough. Prince Philip aware of the hype surrounding the production invited the society to perform the play in St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle. This single performance was on Maundy Thursday and the entire British Royal Family were present for the Easter break.

The Carlton celebrated its 80th birthday in 2007 with a 1920s themed party which was attended by over 100 members, past and present. The group continues to perform a wide range of plays around Wimbledon. They perform regularly at the Wimbledon Time and Leisure Studio Theatre. In recent years their repertoire has included Shakespeare, Moli√®re, John Godber, Ray Cooney alongside original works tackling contemporary issues. In 2018 the Group won three awards from the National Operatic and Dramatic Association, including best male and female actors, in the summer production of The Importance of Being Ernest.

Most information about his life was preserved in his legends which contain most conventional elements of medieval biographies of saints. He was born in a Venetian noble family, associated with the Sagredos or Morosinis in sources written centuries later. After a serious illness, he was sent to the Benedictine San Giorgio Monastery at the age of five. He received excellent monastic education and also learnt grammar, music, philosophy and law. He left Venice for a pilgrimage to the Holy Land around 1020, but a storm compelled him to break his journey near Istria. He decided to visit the Kingdom of Hungary. Maurus, bishop of P√©cs, and Stephen I of Hungary convinced him not to continue his pilgrimage, emphasizing that Gerard's preachings could accelerate the conversion of the Hungarians. Gerard was made the tutor of the king's son and heir, Emeric. Before long, Gerard went to the Bakony Hills to live as a hermit near Bakonyb√©l. Stephen I made him bishop of the newly established Diocese of Csan√°d (encompassing present-day Banat in Serbia, Romania and Hungary) around 1030. Benedictine monks who could speak Hungarian helped him to preach among the local inhabitants.  Sources  Most information of Gerard was not preserved in impartial sources, but in his hagiographies. The Short Life of Saint Gerard, which was composed around 1100, is an abridgement of an earlier biography. The earlier biography did not survive. The Short Life primarily presents Gerard as a bishop. The majority of scholars regard the Short Life the most reliable source of Gerard's life. The Long Life of Saint Gerard is a compilation of multiple sources, including the biography that the author of the shorter legend had also utilized. The Long Life was completed in the late 13th century or in the 14th century. It was regarded as a source of absolute reliability for centuries, but this view radically changed in the 20th century. Gy√∂rgy Gy√∂rffy even stated that the Long Life was a forgery. Historian G√°bor Klaniczay also emphasizes that the longer legend contains obviously anachronistic elements. On the other hand, Carlile Aylmer Macartney says that the Long Life preserved the original form of Gerard's earliest (now lost) biography. Gerard's own work, the Deliberatio supra hymnum trium puerorum also contain references to his life. Simon of K√©za's chronicle and the Illuminated Chronicle preserved fragments from the common source of Gerard's two Lives. A 13th-century rhymed version (or chant) of Gerard's legend was also preserved, but it does not contain more information than the Short Life.  Family and youth  Gerard's Long Life dedicates two chapters to his family and childhood. Conventional elements of medieval hagiographies abound in both chapters, suggesting that the author borrowed many motives from other legends, especially from the Life of Saint Adalbert of Prague. Gerard was born in Venice in a noble family. The noble origin of saintly hermits was often emphasized in their legends. The identification of Gerard's family is uncertain. An expanded version of Petrus de Natalibus's Catalogue of Saints, which was published in 1516, identified Gerard as a member of the Sagredo family. Although the family was granted Venetian nobility only in the 14th century, some scholars (including Fabio Banfi) accept the Sagredos' claim to their kinship with Saint Gerard. Historian L√°szl√≥ Szegf≈± says that Gerard was actually a Morosini. Gerard's father, who was also named Gerard, and mother, Catherine, had awaited his birth for three years. They baptised their son George because he was born on the feast of Saint George (23 April). The year of his birth is unknown, but he was born between around 977 and 1000. He was renamed in the memory of his father who died during a pilgrimage or journey (anachronistically mentioned in Gerard's Long Life as a crusade).  Ecclesiastic career  = Benedictine monk = At the age of five, Gerard was taken seriously ill. His recovery was attributed to the prayers of the Benedictine monks of the San Giorgio Monastery in Venice. His family soon sent him to the monastery, offering him to spiritual life. Gerard took the \\"religious cloth\\" and was educated in the monastery. He could read and write and knew the basic elements of arithmetic. His Long Life emphasizes that Gerard strictly observed the rules of monastic life and wore coarse cloths to \\"mortify his body\\". He also studied the \\"words of the prophets and the speeches of the Orthodox apostles\\". The use of certain expressions (including dux verbi, or \\"leader of the Word\\") suggests that Gerard read Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite in Greek. After the founding abbot of the monastery, John Morosini, died in 1012, Gerard was appointed prior to administer the monastery until the new abbot, Guglielmo, was elected. Guglielmo sent Gerard to \\"Bologna\\" to study grammar, music, philosophy and law. Gerard mentioned his stay in Gaul, where he read Plato, suggesting that the original version of the Long Life or its source referred to his studies in Burgundy instead of Bologna. Gerard returned to the San Giorgo Monastery five years later. His Long Life writes that Gerard was made abbot although he had been opposed to his election. No information about his activities as abbot was preserved in the sources, implying that he actually never held that office. Gerard left for a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. According to his Long Life, he wanted to follow the example of Saint Jerome. Modern historians say that internal strifes (armed conflicts between the Orseolos and their opponents) compelled him to leave the town around 1018 or 1021. A storm forced him to seek refuge in a Benedictine monastery on an island near Istria. In the monastery, he met one Rasina. Historian Gy√∂rgy Gy√∂rffy associates Rasina with Radla, a close companion of Adalbert of Prague; L√°szl√≥ Mezey writes that Rasina was the abbot of the Saint Martin Monastery in Lo≈°inj. Rasina persuaded Gerard to accompany him to Hungary, saying that \\"nowhere else in the world could one find today a more suitable place to win souls for the Lord\\". The conversion of the Hungarians had started in the 970s, but it accelerated only around 1000. The systematic organization of the Church began during the reign of the first king of Hungary, Stephen I of Hungary, who was crowned on the first day the new millennium. = Royal tutor and hermit = Portrayal of Stephen I of Hungary who convinced Gerard to stay in Hungary instead of travelling to the Holy Land Gerard and Rasina visited Zadar, Knin and Senj before reaching P√©cs in Hungary. Gerard met Maurus, bishop of P√©cs, and Anastasius, Abbot of P√©csv√°rad, in P√©cs. The two prelates wanted to persuade Gerard to stay in Hungary, stating that \\"God's will\\" had brought him to the country. After Gerard gave sermons in their presence, Maurus and Anastasius stated that he was a \\"master of the word\\", declaring that such a cleric had never visited Hungary. Maurus and Anastasius convinced Gerard, who wanted to continue his pilgrimage to the Holy Land, to meet King Stephen I in Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r. During their meeting, the king emphasized that his realm was the most suitable place for Gerard \\"to serve God\\", promising that he would authorize Gerard to preach anywhere in Hungary. Stephen I even threatened Gerard that he would not allow him to continue his journey to Jerusalem, but also alluding that he would make Gerard bishop. Finally, Gerard accepted Stephen's proposal and decided to stay in Hungary. Before long, on the Feast of the Assumption (15 August), Gerard gave a sermon in honor of the \\"Woman clothed with the Sun\\", which was the first recorded sign of the cult of Virgin Mary in Hungary. According to Macartney, the description of Gerard's journey to Hungary and his meetings with the two prelates and the king were incorporated into the Long Life based on a nearly contemporaneous report, but they contain evidently imaginary details, such as the conversations between Gerard and Stephen I. Gerard was made the tutor of Stephen's son and heir, Emeric. Gerard's role as the crown prince's tutor was only mentioned in the Long Life, implying that this was only an invention by the hagiographer who wanted to create a strong connection between the three most important saints of the early Kingdom of Hungary, but the story is not surely invented. Szegf≈± writes that Gerard may have influenced Stephen's Admonitions to Emeric. L√°szl√≥ Mezey proposes that Gerard was only responsible for the spiritual education of Emeric. After Emeric's education was completed, Gerard settled in the Bakony Hills to live as a hermit near Bakonyb√©l, at a place where the saintly Gunther of Bohemia had lived. Szegf≈± says that Gerard's withdrawal from the royal court was the consequence of the arrival of the family of the Doge Otto Orseolo to Hungary around 1024. During the following years, Gerard built a chapel at the foot of a hill, and wrote theological studies and homilies (which were later lost). He referred to the commentaries that he had written to the Epistle to the Hebrews and to the Prologue to the Gospel of John. Gerard lived as a hermit for seven years, which suggests that he must have spent several years in the Bakony Hills even if the author of his legend only invented the symbolic number seven. = Bishop of Csan√°d = A powerful chieftain, Ajtony, ruled the region near the rivers Tisza, Danube and Mure»ô in the early 11th century. He was baptised according to the \\"Greek rite\\" and settled \\"Greek\\" (or Eastern Orthodox) monks in his seat on the Mure»ô. After Ajtony began taxing the salt carried on the Mure»ô, Stephen I of Hungary sent the royal army against him under the command of Csan√°d, who had previously been Ajtony's commander. Csan√°d defeated and killed Ajtony whose domain was transformed into a county. Ajtony's seat was renamed for Csan√°d. After the conquest of Ajtony's territory, Stephen I summoned Gerard from his hermitage and made him bishop of the newly established Diocese of Csan√°d. L√°szl√≥ Mezey says that the king appointed Gerard to administer the diocese because Gerard's knowledge of the Greek language and the Eastern Orthodox theological ideas enabled him to preach in a territory where Greek priests had up to that time proselytized. The Annales Posonienses recorded that \\"Gerard was consecrated bishop\\" in 1030, but the reliability of this date was not accepted by all historians. The king appointed twelve monks from the Benedictine monasteries in Hungary to accompany Gerard to his see. Seven of the twelve monks who could speak Hungarian were tasked with interpreting for Gerard among Ajtony's former subjects. The Greek monks who had arrived during Ajtony's rule were transferred from Csan√°d to a monastery newly established at Oroszl√°mos (present-day Banatsko Aranƒëelovo in Serbia), and their former monastery was granted to the Benedictines. Gerard and the Benedictine monks shared a house and he forbade them to leave it without his authorization. The monks were required to be present for the morning service and to wear monastic costume. Gerard continued to wear the habits of a hermit (cilice or goat skins) and spent days in solitude in the forests near his see. His legend also writes that he often \\"took the axe\\" to cut woods to \\"mortify his flesh\\" and to help to \\"those who had to do this work\\". Gerard was a missionary bishop, tasked with the conversion of the pagan inhabitants of his diocese. His Long Life writes that people came to Gerard, \\"noblemen and commoners, rich and poor\\", asking him to baptize them \\"in the name of the Holy Trinity\\". They brought horses, cattle, sheep, carpets, rings and necklaces to give them to the bishop. The Long Life credits Gerard with the building of churches \\"for every city\\" in his diocese to serve the growing number of believers. Although the Long Life attributes the establishment of the archdeaconries of Gerard's diocese to him, most scholars regard this statement as a clear anachronism. Gerard regularly visited Stephen. During a travel from Csan√°d to the royal court in Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r or Esztergom, he and one of his clerics, Walther, stayed in a manor where a slave woman was singing while making flour on a grinder. Gerard referred to the music as the \\"symphonia Ungarorum\\" (or \\"drum of the Hungarians\\"), associating the sound of the grinder with a drum roll. Being touched by her cheerfulness while making a hard work, Gerard gave the woman precious gifts. Stephen I died on 15 August 1038. His nephew, the Venetian Peter Orseolo mounted the throne, but he was dethroned in 1041. Peter's successor, Samuel Aba, had many lords executed. He visited Csan√°d, asking Gerard to put a crown on his head during the mass on Resurrection Sunday. He refused Aba, but the bishops who accompanied the king to Csan√°d, performed the coronation. Gerard went to the pulpit, declaring that the \\"sword of vengeance will descend\\" upon Aba's head in three years, because he had gained the kingdom by deceit. The credibility of the report of the Long Life of Aba's visit in Gerard's see is subject to scholarly debates.  Martyrdom  miniature from the Anjou Legendarium showing St. Gerard falling to his death (1330) The Holy Roman Emperor, Henry III, invaded Hungary and defeated Aba in the Battle of M√©nf≈ë in 1044. Peter Orseolo was restored, but his rule was unpopular, because he favored his German and Italian retaineers. Gerard's martyrdom took place on 24 September 1046, during the Vata pagan uprising. His co-martyrs were Bystrik and Buldus. There are various accounts of his death. According to one, he was stoned, pierced with a lance, and his body thrown from the Blocksberg cliff into the Danube. An alternate account claims that he was placed on a two-wheel cart, hauled to the hilltop and rolled down a hill of Buda, now named Gellert Hill, then still being alive at the bottom, was beaten to death. Other unverified tales report him as being put into a spiked barrel and rolled down the hill during a mass revolt of pagans. Canonized in 1083, along with St. Stephen and St. Emeric, Gerard is currently one of the patron saints of Hungary. His feast day is 24 September.

The Centre's aim is to carry out lexicographic research into needs-adapted information and data access, i.e. research work into dictionary theory in general and it has built a solid, international reputation in that field. The Centre is headed by professor Dr. Henning Bergenholtz who together with associate professor Dr. Sven Tarp, has proposed a theory that is often referred to as \\"the Aarhus School\\", see e.g. Bergenholtz/Nielsen/Tarp (2009) and Nielsen/Tarp (2009). The theory focuses on the functions of dictionaries, i.e. communication related functions (such as text reception, text production, text revision, text editing, and translation ‚Äì which are all text-dependent) and knowledge related or cognitive functions (such as gaining knowledge in general or about a specific topic unrelated to a specific text). The theory focuses on the dictionary as a utility product, i.e. it provides a specific type of help to a specific type of user in specific types of user situations. The work at the Centre focuses on all aspects of lexicography, in particular LSP lexicography (e.g. Nielsen 1994; and Bergenholtz/Tarp 1995), learner's lexicography (e.g. Tarp 2008), language policy in dictionaries (e.g. Bergenholtz 2006), and dictionary reviewing (e.g. Nielsen 2009). In addition to their theoretical work the staff at the Centre for Lexicography have published more than 30 printed and electronic dictionaries, often in collaboration with external partners. These dictionaries are all based on the theoretical principles developed at the Centre and cover monolingual and bilingual general dictionaries, business dictionaries, law dictionaries and accounting dictionaries.

The Jamuna River ( Jomuna) is one of the three main rivers of Bangladesh. It is the lower stream of the Brahmaputra River, which originates in Tibet as Yarlung Tsangpo, before flowing into India and then southwest into Bangladesh. The Jamuna flows south and joins the Padma River (P√¥dda), near Goalundo Ghat, before meeting the Meghna River near Chandpur. It then flows into the Bay of Bengal as the Meghna River. The Brahmaputra-Jamuna is a classic example of a braided river and is highly susceptible to channel migration and avulsion. It is characterised by a network of interlacing channels with numerous sandbars enclosed between them. The sandbars, known in Bengali as chars, do not occupy a permanent position. The river deposits them in one year, very often to be destroyed later, and redeposits them in the next rainy season. The process of bank and deposit erosion together with redeposition has been going on continuously, making it difficult to precisely demarcate the boundary between the district of Pabna on one side and the districts of Mymensingh, Tangail and Dhaka on the other. The breaking of a char or the emergence of a new one is also a cause of much violence and litigation. The confluence of the Jamuna River and Padma River is unusually unstable and has been shown to have migrated southeast by over fourteen kilometres between 1972 and 2014. Jamuna River Course A view of Jamuna River from Jamuna Bridge In Bangladesh, the Brahmaputra is joined by the Teesta River (or Tista), one of its largest tributaries. The Teesta earlier ran due south from Jalpaiguri in three channels, namely, the Karatoya to the east, the Punarbhaba in the west and the Atrai in the centre. The three channels possibly gave the name to the river as Trisrota \\"possessed of three streams\\" which has been shortened and corrupted to Teesta. Of these three, the Punarbhaba joined the Mahananda. The Atrai passing through a vast marshy area known as Chalan Beel joined the Karatoya and the united stream joined the Padma (Ganges) near Jafarganj. In the destructive floods of 1787, the Teesta river forsook its old channel and rushing south-east it joined the Brahmaputra. Majumdar, Dr. R.C., History of Ancient Bengal, First published 1971, Reprint 2005, p. 4, Tulshi Prakashani, Kolkata, . James Rennell made a survey between 1764 and 1777 and his maps are one of the earliest authentic maps of Bengal in existence. In these maps Teesta is shown as flowing through North Bengal in several branches ‚Äî Punarbhaba, Atrai, Karatoya, etc. All these streams combined lower down with the Mahananda, now the westernmost river in North Bengal, and taking the name of Hoorsagar finally discharged into the Ganges at Jafarganj, near modern Goalundo. The Hoorsagar river is still in existence, being the combined outfall of the Baral, a spill channel of the Ganges, the Atrai, the Jamuna or Jamuneswari (not the main Jamuna through which the Brahmaputra now flows), and the Karatoya, but instead of falling into the Ganges, it falls into the main Jamuna, a few kilometres above its confluence with the Padma at Goalundo. Majumdar, S.C., Chief Engineer, Bengal, Rivers of the Bengal Delta, Government of Bengal, 1941, reproduced in Rivers of Bengal, Vol I, 2001, p. 45, published by Education department, Government of West Bengal. Jamalpur and Mymensingh and a much narrower Jamuna or Jamuneswari before an earthquake in 1762, and the Teesta R. flowing in 3 channels to the Ganges before a flood in 1787. Below the Teesta, the Brahmaputra splits into two distributary branches. The western branch, which contains the majority of the river's flow, continues due south as the Jamuna () to merge with the lower Ganges, called the Padma River (). The eastern branch, formerly the larger but now much smaller, is called the lower or Old Brahmaputra (). It curves southeast to join the Meghna River near Dhaka. The Padma and Meghna converge near Chandpur and flow out into the Bay of Bengal. This final part of the river is called Meghna. In the past the course of the lower Brahmaputra was different and passed through the Jamalpur and Mymensingh districts. In a major magnitude earthquake on April 2, 1762, the main channel of the Brahmaputra at Bhahadurabad point was switched southwards and opened as Jamuna due to the result of tectonic uplift of the Madhupur tract. The Jamuna is a very wide river. During the rains it is about from bank to bank. Even during the dry season when the waters subside, the breadth is hardly less than . The Jamuna was a barrier in establishing a direct road link between capital Dhaka and northern part of Bangladesh, better known as Rajshahi Division, until 1996. This was mitigated by the completion of the Jamuna Multi-purpose Bridge. It is also a very important waterway. It is navigable all year round by large cargo and passenger steamers. Before the Partition of Bengal in 1947, passenger steamers used to ply up to Dibrugarh in the state of Assam in the Indian Union. At present two steamer ferry services link the district of Pabna with the districts of Mymensingh, Tangail and Dhaka. The Bangladesh Railway maintains a ferry service between Serajganj in Pabna and Jagannathganj in Mymensingh. The other ferry service between Nagarbari in Pabna and Aricha in Dhaka is run by the C & B Department.

An ongoing downturn in the container shipping industry which began in 2013, and that was caused by various factors such as weak global GDP, muted demand for container shipping, sluggish global trade growth, and container vessel overcapacity left the container shipping market crippled.http://www.joc.com/maritime-news/profit- warning-issued-cimc-market-downturn-persists_20160715.html The slump has precipitated a wave of mergers and acquisitions coupled with reshuffled vessel sharing alliances as container lines scramble to stay financially viable. Consequently; due to the decline in the industry, CSCL's parent China Shipping Group entered advanced merger talks with its larger government-owned compatriot, the COSCO Group in October 2015.https://www.wsj.com/articles/cosco-china-shipping-group-in-advanced- merger-talks-1444840906 By late December 2015, the two announced a formal merger after regulatory and antitrust approval. The integration plan stipulated that CSCL will withdraw its involvement in the container shipping business and cease to operate as a carrier; instead it is destined to become a container leasing and financial-asset management company.http://www.joc.com/maritime-news/cscl-plan-exit-box-business- raises-o3-alliance-question_20151213.html Meanwhile, COSCO Group's container shipping division; COSCO Container Lines (renamed COSCO Shipping Lines), is expected to take over as the sole operator of the vessel fleet. Furthermore, as part of the reconfiguration plan, the CSCL brand was abandoned and renamed as COSCO Shipping Development in an effort to align the company with its new identity in the merged mega-entity. The new company formed by the integration of China Shipping and COSCO; now known as China COSCO Shipping, aims to expand its fleet size to more than 2 million TEUs by 2018, which would make it the world's third-largest container carrier in terms of vessel capacity. Corporate affairs CSCL, established in 1997, provided fully containerized marine and intermodal freight transport, storage, and electronic data interchange services worldwide. The company called on ports across the world, and more than 30 ports from South China to North China in its domestic coastal business. It also operated container yards and trucks, international cargo agencies, and terminal facilities in many countries. North American freight services included refrigerated cargo carriage in the line's own reefer container fleet, as well as other specialized cargo container services. CSCL continued to grow rapidly until it became the eighth largest container line at its peak after acquiring minority interest in Asia Pacific Marine Container Lines of Canada. Its fleet comprised over 150 vessels, with a total operating capacity of . China Shipping container As part of the integration with COSCO, all of CSCL's North American offices ceased operations in June 2016. Additionally, CSCL and UASC (United Arab Shipping Company) cooperated on the Asia-Europe-Asia trade route by sharing vessel space in order to cut costs and improve efficiency. Both companies also ordered 5 ships bigger than the Maersk Triple E class. In 2014, CSCL and UASC entered a new vessel sharing partnership, dubbed the Ocean Three alliance, alongside the French CMA CGM.\\"Shipping Industry Consolidation Set to Continue, Says CMA CGM Executive\\" Wall Street Journal, 3 December 2014. Accessed: 12 December 2014. It was announced in July 2016 that the Ocean Three alliance will be dismantled by March 2017 because of the CSCL-COSCO merger and because UASC reported a merger with Hapag-Lloyd.

Early life and Gleason Works Catherine Anselm Gleason was born the first of four children of William and Ellen McDermott Gleason of Rochester, New York, emigrants from Ireland. Her father was the owner of a machine tool company, later named Gleason Works, which later became one of the most important makers of gear-cutting machine tools in the world. When she was 11, her stepbrother Tom died of typhoid fever, causing hardship at her father's company because Tom had been an important helper. At the age of 12 she began working for her father to fill the void left by Tom's death. In 1884 at the age of 19, Kate Gleason enrolled in the Cornell Mechanical Arts program. She was the first woman to be admitted to study engineering at Cornell University in Ithaca, NY , although she was unable to complete her studies at Cornell due to her required presence in the factory. Her father had hired a man to replace her in the business but the firm started struggling financially and her father could no longer afford to pay Kate's replacement and he called her home to help again at Gleason Works. She never was able to complete the requirements for a degree but through training and self-learning she earned the title of engineer and is recognized for her accomplishments. She did get some further education at Sibley College of Engraving and The Mechanics Institute which is now Rochester Institute of Technology Gleason Works Gleason was actively involved as the treasurer as well as saleswoman for Gleason Works. In 1893, she toured Europe to expand the company's business, one of the first times an American manufacturer tried to globalize their business. Today, international sales make up almost 3/4 of the company's business. Memorial in East Rochester, New York Fred H. Colvin described Kate Gleason in his memoirs as \\"a kind of Madame Curie of machine tools [‚Ä¶] Kate spent her youth learning her father's business from the ground up, both in the shop and in the field, so that when she branched out for herself about 1895 as a saleswoman for her father's gear-cutting machines, she knew as much as any man in the business.\\". Ellen Gleason was a friend of fellow Rochesterian Susan B. Anthony, and Kate Gleason later cited Anthony as a source of advice. Gleason undertook several efforts supporting Women's Suffrage after Anthony's death. Life after leaving the Gleason Works Due to conflicts with her family, she left Gleason Works in 1913 and found work at the Ingle Machining Company. She Joined Ingle Machine Company on 1 January 1914. She was appointed the receiver of bankruptcy for the company, the first woman to do so. Under her guidance she restored the company and repaid their outstanding debts. The company was returned to the stockholders before the end of 1915. After her endeavors with Ingle Machine Company, she turned her attention to East Rochester where she helped to finance and build 8 factories for various companies. In 1914, she was the first woman elected to full membership in the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, followed by Lydia Weld, and represented the society at the World Power Conference in Germany. In 1918, she was appointed the president of First National Bank of East Rochester while the previous President was enlisted in World War I. During this period she took charge of a problem loan and used it to finish the housing complexes left from the previous loan holder. She used this to further her humanitarian efforts in Rochester, starting eight companies, including a construction company that built houses for the middle class. After this success, she took it upon herself to experiment with concrete to build cheap fireproof houses at an affordable cost using a pouring method she developed. After this success, she described her methods in an article she wrote for a trade magazine, Concrete, in 1921 titled \\"How Women Builds Houses to Sell at a Profit for $4000\\". Later, she left Rochester for business opportunities in South Carolina and California. In the 1920s she rebuilt a castle in Septmonts France for herself. As well as helping the surrounding towns to recover from the damage left from the world war. During this time period she also toured California to study adobe buildings. In 1924, she was asked by Berkeley, California to help them rebuild after a fire. In the late 1920s she began to build more poured concrete buildings in Sausalito, California, but she ran into some more issues and the project was not as successful as her buildings in Rochester. Then at her winter home in Beaufort, South Carolina she had plans to make a community of garden apartments for artists and writers but only 10 of these homes were completed at the time of her death. Personal life Gleason was a supporter of women's suffrage. According to an account of 1912 National America Woman Suffrage Association Convention mentions Gleason as having promised $1,200 to the suffrage movement, one of its largest pledges. Many of Kate Gleason's personal writings testify to her and her father's contributions to women's suffrage. Gleason viewed marriage as a hindrance to her professional life and she never married nor had children. Death and legacy Riverside Cemetery She died January 9, 1933, of pneumonia and is interred in Riverside Cemetery in Rochester. She left much of her $1.4 million estate to institutions in the Rochester area, including libraries, parks, and the Rochester Institute of Technology. The Kate Gleason College of Engineering at RIT is named in her honor, and her bust stands proudly in the hallway. Kate Gleason Hall is an RIT residence hall. Gleason Works is still in operation today and retains a strong connection with RIT. In 2010, RIT press published a collection of Gleason's letters.Janis F.

In 2007, there was a thinking that an inland harbour could be built at Sabroom, connected to the sea through a canal, if Bangladesh allowed it. The construction of such a harbour could reduce considerably the cost of transportation of goods from the rest of India to Tripura and the north-east of India. However, the idea had not been acted on through 2007.  Bridge  A bridge is to be built over the Feni River to link up with Tripura. Construction was set to begin in December 2010 for the link between Sabroom and Ramgarh. When completed, the bridge would provide the only land link between India's eastern states and its western states other than through Assam. The foundation stone for the bridge was officially laid by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in June 2015. The cost of constructing the bridge, as well as the approach roads to it in both Bangladesh and India, will be borne by India. The Tripura Public Works Department was appointed to execute the project. When completed, the bridge will connect Tripura with the Chittagong port in Bangladesh providing landlocked North East India with access to the sea, and enabling the transport of heavy machines and goods to North East India via Bangladesh.  Feni dam The Feni is closed near the sea by the Feni dam. This dam has been constructed in 1985 to prevent floodings by surges the lower reaches of the Feni due to cyclones and make a large area fitted for agriculture. The dam is mainly constructed by manual Labour. Between the dam and the Bay of Bengal the river is a tidal river.

Eisenhuth in 1907. She served as the first Oklahoma Commissioner of Charities and Corrections for two four-year terms, the only position that the 1907 Oklahoma Constitution permitted a woman to hold. Before being elected to office, Barnard had worked as a teacher and in clerical patronage positions in the territorial government. She was also heavily involved in charity work. Early life Barnard was born in Geneva, Nebraska, on May 23, 1875, to John P. and Rachel Sheill Barnard.Musslewhite, Lynn, and Suzanne Jones Crawford, \\"Barnard, Catherine Ann (1875-1930),\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture (accessed May 7, 2010). Her mother died when she was two and the family was living in Kansas. She was raised by relatives until 1891, when she moved to Newalla, Oklahoma, where her father, a jack-of-all-trades, had a land claim. She lived alone on the claim for two years while he lived and worked in Oklahoma City. She moved to Oklahoma City in 1895, attended St. Joseph's Academy (a Catholic school), obtained a teaching certificate, and taught until 1902.*\\"Saint Kate.\\" Oklahoma Today. Logan, Jim. December 2012. Retrieved August 11, 2014. Charity work After she quit teaching, Barnard took a business course, then became a secretary for the territorial legislature in Oklahoma City. In 1904, she was selected from among 500 applicants to be a \\"territorial hostess\\" at the St. Louis World's Fair. While in St. Louis, she met Jane Addams and others who were active in social reform movements. She also was exposed to big-city slum life, crime and other related social ills. From then on, she became a reformer. Prior to Oklahoma statehood, Barnard was involved in aid and charity work in Oklahoma City and was the head of the union-label organization in Oklahoma. She also participated in the Farm-Labor meetings of 1906 in Shawnee which drafted the \\"Shawnee Demands\\" that later formed the basis of the soon-to-be-drafted Oklahoma state constitution. Kate Barnard, \\"Oklahoma Kate\\" Elected Charities and Corrections Commissioner Barnard in 1912. =Compulsory education, child labor, abuse of prisoners= After her election as the Charities and Corrections Commissioner, she was a key player in the enactment of the compulsory education laws, state support of poor widows dependent on their children's earnings, and statutes implementing the constitutional ban on child labor. She also was an advocate for working Oklahomans through the work she did in securing legislation aimed at eradicating unsafe working conditions and the blacklist of union members. She was one of the few public officials who dared to cry out against the abuse of Native American children. Barnard relied on her stirring speeches to reach the public and convince the political powers of the need for increased federal protection for all Five Tribes' members. Some have said that her most important action may have been when she uncovered the abusive treatment of Oklahoma prisoners who were being held in Kansas prisons under contract, which included forced labor in coal mines and torture. Her work and the pressure she put on Oklahoma's first Governor, Charles N. Haskell, resulted in the return of the prisoners to Oklahoma and the construction of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester, Oklahoma. =End of her political career= Her political career ended during her second term in office, after she began to advocate on behalf of Indian wards who were being cheated out of their land as a result of grafting. Her work on behalf of Indian children raised the ire of William H. Murray and other prominent Oklahoma businessmen and officials who convinced the state legislature to defund her office. Wilma Mankiller's 1993 book, Mankiller, A Chief and Her People, on page 173 quotes Barnard: \\"I have been compelled to see orphans robbed, starved, and burned for money. I have named the men and accused them and furnished the records and affidavits to convict them, but with no result. I decided long ago that Oklahoma had no citizen who cared whether or not an orphan is robbed or starved or killed - because his dead claim is easier to handle than if he were alive.\\" Later life, death, and legacy During the rest of her life, Barnard continued to live in Oklahoma (often traveling to Colorado and other states during the summer due to her severe health problems) and she died on February 23, 1930 in Oklahoma City (where she was found dead in a hotel bathroom). She was buried in Oklahoma City (in a grave that was not marked until the 1980s), but today a bronze statue of her is on display on the first floor of the Oklahoma State Capitol. She was inducted in the Oklahoma Women's Hall of Fame in 1982.

Biography Of Jewish descent,Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism, and the Politics of Identity, NYU Press (2003), p. 118 Stein studied mathematics, physics, and philosophy at Vienna University, before completing a doctorate in philosophy at the end of the First World War, having continued work on it throughout his service in an artillery unit in the war. He became a personal student of Rudolf Steiner from about the age of 21, and enjoyed the unofficial supervision of Steiner while writing his dissertation. Broadly speaking, the dissertation was an attempt to write a theory of cognition for spiritual knowledge. After the First World War, Stein assisted Steiner in promoting Social Threefolding. When it became apparent in 1919 that these efforts were not going to succeed, Steiner asked Stein to teach history and German literature at the first Waldorf School in Stuttgart. It was as part of this work that Stein began his research on the Grail, which culminated in 1928 with his book The Ninth Century and the Holy Grail.First published in German as Weltgeschichte im Lichte des heiligen Gral. Das neunte Jahrhundert; the latest English edition is The Ninth Century and the Holy Grail, Temple Lodge Publishing 2001. In this work, he attempted to identify historical people and events represented in the Grail epic and to interpret Parzival as an esoteric document representing the human path of inner development. Stein also wrote various articles on these themes.Walter Johannes Stein, Der Tod Merlins. Published in English as The Death of Merlin, Arthurian Myth and Alchemy, Floris Books 1989. Stein lectured extensively on anthroposophy and related themes from the early 1920s onward, giving up to 300 lectures a year. He also contributed many articles to The Present Age and similar periodicals, and wrote a number of short books including The Principle of Reincarnation, Gold: in History and in Modern Times, West-East: A Study in National Relationships, Labour: in History and in Modern Times, and The British: Their Psychology and Destiny. Stein claimed to have had a spiritual breakthrough in 1924 using the meditative methods of Steiner and to have attained some insight into his own karmic background.Johannes Tautz, Walter Johannes Stein: A Biography. Temple Lodge Press 1990. Stein moved to London in 1933, at the invitation of the theosophist-turned-anthroposophist Daniel Nicol Dunlop. Dunlop was director of the British Electrical and Allied Manufacturers' Association (BEAMA), and chairman of the executive council of the World Power Conference. Dunlop had called Stein to London to take up a post in research for the World Power Conference; he had apparently founded the World Power Conference as a precursor to a World Economic Conference, and he had called Stein to London to assist him especially with this latter, more ambitious, project. Dunlop died in 1935 before this plan could be brought to fruition, but Stein did bring about Dunlop's wish for an independent cultural journal in the form of The Present Age. Stein, having taken up various studies in economics, geography, and geology for his collaborative work with Dunlop, was able to bring together the results of this work in a special issue of the journal under the title The Earth as a Basis of World Economy. The publication of the journal ceased with the start of the Second World War. During and after the Second World War Stein made many connections in government circles in Britain, as well as with the Dutch and Belgian royal families. Fictionalization Stein is one of the chief characters in Trevor Ravenscroft's books The Spear of Destiny and The Cup of Destiny. Though Ravenscroft claimed that he had been a pupil of Stein's, investigative reporter Eric Wynants discovered the Stein/Ravenscroft connection was a complete fabrication while interviewing Ravenscroft for an article in 1982.According to Wynants, Ravenscroft admitted during their interview that he had never actually met W.J. Stein, but \\"talked to him only via a medium\\".

It connects Bhuapur on the Jamuna River's east bank to Sirajganj on its west bank. It was the 11th longest bridge in the world when constructed in 1998 and at present is the 6th longest bridge in South Asia. The Jamuna River, which it spans, is one of the three major rivers of Bangladesh, and is fifth largest in the world in discharge volume. History of construction Jamuna Multi-purpose Bridge showing 8 rows of bolts for 4 rails The river Jamuna (Brahmaputra), along with the lower stretch of the Padma (Ganges) divides Bangladesh into nearly two equal halves. Until now all road and rail communication between the two parts of the country has had to rely on time-consuming ferry services that were often disrupted because of navigability problems. The need for a bridge over the Jamuna River was felt, especially by the people living in northwestern Bangladesh, for a long time. This perceived need did not go unnoticed by the policy makers. Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge was constructed by Hyundai Heavy Industries at a cost of $696 million. The cost was shared by IDA, ADB, OECD, and the government of Bangladesh. Of the total, IDA, ADB and OECD supplied $200 million each through a loan with 1% nominal interest, and the remaining $96 million was borne by Bangladesh. The main bridge is long with 47 main spans of approximately 100 metres and two end spans of approximately 65 metres. Connected to the bridge are east and west approach viaducts each with 12 spans of 10 metre length and transition spans of 8 metres. The total width of the bridge deck is 18.5 metres. The river crossing was designed to carry a dual two-lane carriageway, a dual gauge (broad and metre) railway, a high voltage (230 kV) electrical interconnector, telecommunication cables and a 750 mm diameter high pressure natural gas pipeline. The carriageways are 6.315 metres wide separated by a 0.57 metre width central barrier; the rail track is along the north side of the deck. On the main bridge, electrical interconnector pylons are positioned on brackets cantilevered from the north side of the deck. Telecommunication ducts run through the box girder deck and the gas pipeline is under the south cantilever of the box section. The bridge has been built by Hyundai Engineering and Construction (Korea) as a 'design and build' contract. TY Lin Assoc. of San Francisco carried out the design as a sub-contractor for Hyundai. The approach roads were constructed by Samwhan Corporation (Korea). Specifications South toll plaza, Bangabandhu Bridge =Sub-structure= The bridge is supported on tubular steel piles, driven into the river bed. Sand was removed from within the piles by airlifting and replaced with concrete. Out of the 50 piers, 21 piers are supported on groups of three piles (each of 2.5 m diameter) and 29 piers on groups of two piles (each of 3.15 diameter). The driving of 121 piles started on October 15, 1995 and was completed in July 1996. The pier stems are founded on concrete pilecaps, whose shells were precast and infilled with in-situ reinforced concrete. The reinforced concrete pier stems support pierheads which contain bearings and seismic devices. These allow movement of the deck under normal loading conditions but lock in the event of an earthquake to limit overall seismic loads through the structure and minimise damage. =Superstructure= The main bridge deck is a multi-span precast prestressed concrete segmental structure, constructed by the balanced cantilever method. Each cantilever has 12 segments (each 4 m long), joined to a pierhead unit (2 m long) at each pier and by an in-situ stitch at mid span. The deck is internally prestressed and of single box section. The depth of the box varies between 6.5 metres at the piers to 3.25 metres at mid-span. An expansion joint is provided every 7 spans by means of a hinge segment at approximately quarter span. The segments were precast and erected using a two-span erection gantry. Gauge The Bangabandhu Bridge carries a dual broad and metre gauge railway track. It also carries pylons for a powerline. Litigation Within a decade of inauguration, cracks were detected on the bridge prompting the authorities to impose limits on the number of vehicles allowed to cross at any given time. By early 2008, the government announced its intention to sue the South Korean conglomerate Hyundai for flawed design.

Other members worked on side projects, including Kubinski and Egeness's Cheap Trick tribute band Chick Treat. On April 1, 1992, Egeness left the band. Shortly thereafter, the rest of the band members formed the band Chainfall, along with guitarist Charles Jordan (of S.O.D.A and Nerve Twins). Kubinski and Tunison later played in Fuckface, while Brammer played with the Carnival Strippers. Kubinski went on to form a new band, Custom Grand. Kubinski now plays in Decapitado.

Die Kreuzen resumed playing shows, performing at sold-out show May 26, 2012, at Turner Hall in Milwaukee, WI. They recently played the 2013 Roadburn Festival in Tilburg, Holland and the Afterburner show the following day. After their return to the states, Die Kreuzen played a secret show at a small Milwaukee club as a warm up to their May 25 concert at The Double Door in Chicago, Ill and their much anticipated return to Turner Hall on May 26, 2012.

The terms Parliamentary drafter, Parliamentary draftsman, legislative drafting officer and legislative counsel are also widely used. These terms are used in relation to the United Kingdom parliament in Westminster, and other parliaments and assemblies based on the Westminster system. The official title, and organisation, of the parliamentary counsel varies between legislatures. For example, those who draft government legislation for the UK parliament form the Parliamentary Counsel Office (established in 1869 under the title of the Office of Parliamentary Counsel) while the Scottish Government's Parliamentary Counsel Office drafts legislation for the Scottish Parliament, the (Northern Irish) Office of the Legislative Counsel drafts legislation for the Northern Ireland Assembly and the (Welsh) Office of the Legislative Counsel performs the same role in relation to Senedd Cymru (the Welsh Parliament). In the Republic of Ireland, there is an Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to Government. In Australia, each state, territory and the federal government has an Office of Parliamentary Counsel. The job of a parliamentary drafter is to draft the detailed form of proposed laws, in a way that will accurately reflect the intentions of the politicians who are promulgating them, without leaving loopholes or producing perverse results.McCluskie QC, John Cameron, \\"Who Wrote This Bill? The Life and Work of Scottish Parliamentary Counsel\\", Scottish Parliamentary Review, Vol. I, No. 2 (Jan, 2014) [Edinburgh: Blacket Avenue Press] This is a difficult task, and the pursuit of exact and watertight legislation has often resulted in obscure and convoluted language. Such language has been criticised both by government bodies such as the committee under Sir David Renton that reported in 1975 (and recommended drafting which was more based on principles than specific details to address every possible situation). In parliamentary discussion, the drafter is rarely if ever referred to by name, but only as an office. However, the post has been held by a number of distinguished lawyers, for example Bernard O'Dowd in Australia, John Ferguson McLennan specialising in Scottish law (which though enacted entirely in the UK parliament from 1707 until 1999, is distinct from English law), and William Philip Schreiner in South Africa.

Biography Antonio Ruberti was born in Aversa in the province of Caserta, Campania. He trained as an engineer and taught control engineering and systems theory as the first head of the Department of Science and Engineering of La Sapienza university in Rome, a university of which he was later Rector. In 1987, he joined the Italian government as Minister for the Coordination of Scientific and Technological Research. He held this position for five years. He was appointed to the European Commission by the Italian government 1993, when he joined the Delors Commission with the portfolio covering science, research, technological development and education. Ruberti was only a commissioner until 1995 but during this short mandate, he launched a series of new initiatives including the Socrates and Leonardo da Vinci programmes, the European Week of Scientific Culture, and the European Science and Technology Forum.

Approximately 40-percent of all wildfire deaths are caused by such fire entrapments, or what are sometimes called \\"burnovers\\". Description Like a backfire, an escape fire works by depriving an approaching primary fire of fuel, so that when the primary fire reaches the point where the escape fire started the primary fire cannot continue, as there is nothing there to burn. Description of the use of an escape fire, in the context of the Yarnell Hill Fire: \\"They‚Äôd use flares to set the brush around them on fire, a technique Wag Dodge, a Montana firefighter, famously used to save his own life on a fire that killed 13 smoke jumpers more than 60 years earlier. It would burn the fuel out around the safety zone and keep the flames farther away from the shelters.\\" In contrast, unlike a backfire, an escape fire does not attempt to control - let alone stop - a wildfire. Escape fires are an option in grassland but do not work in forest fires, because timber burns too slowly to consume the fuel before the main fire arrives. Notable examples James Fenimore Cooper described the technique in his novel The Prairie (1827), but it became well-known only after the Mann Gulch fire of August 5, 1949, when (Robert Wagner) \\"Wag\\" Dodge came up with the same idea independently and successfully put it into practice.

Located northeast of Billund, it serves as one of the country's busiest air cargo centres, as well as a charter airline destination. Most major European airports are connected to Billund via multiple daily scheduled flights. Nearby Legoland Billund park is the largest tourist attraction in Denmark outside Copenhagen. History Billund Airport had its beginning in 1961 when the son of the founder of the Lego Group, Godtfred Kirk Christiansen, established a private 800-meter long runway and hangar north of his factory in Billund. With Christiansen as a key driver, more of the neighbouring municipalities were included in the group of owners, and it was planned that the airport should be expanded to a regular public airport. The construction of the new airport was carried out during 1964 and the airport opened on 1 November, with one runway at 1660 meters in length and 45 meters width, a small platform where aircraft could be served, and a control tower to the controller. Hans Erik Christensen, the former chief pilot at LEGO, became director, and the passengers were handled in LEGO's hangar until the first terminal building was opened in the spring of 1966. The airport was continuously expanded the following years, with new facilities, terminal buildings, lounge, tax-free area and hangars where LC Johansen's studio often participated as an architect (today called the Johannsen Architects), while other work was carried out by the airport's own studio. In 1997 they had an architectural competition for a new 430,000 ft¬≤ (40,000 m¬≤) passenger terminal, designed to serve 3.5 million passengers a year, north of the original airport. KHR Architects won the assignment and completed the construction in co-operation with COWI, and at the end of May 2002 the new passenger terminal was put to use, as the first phase of the future expansion, which is scheduled to take place north of the start and runway, while air cargo services, business and private aviation will continue to be served from the existing buildings south of the runway. In connection with this expansion, the largest since the beginning of the airport, it was with effect from 1 January 1997 turned into a Joint-stock company, Billund Airport A/S, with the former members Vejle County and municipalities Vejle, Kolding, Grindsted, Billund, and Give as shareholders. In 2008, the entire runway was renovated and paved, and a new taxiway was built, nicknamed \\"Mike\\". This major task only took 14 hours. The runway was closed over night between the hours 23:00 and 06:00. This did not prevent a Boeing 737-800 from Ryanair landing at one end of the runway, while they worked at the other end. The same year was also a record year for the airport. 2,546,856 passengers passed through the terminals, an increase of 12.7 percent compared with 2007. From mid-2009, the airport was served by 9 airlines flying regular flight service, of which KLM had the busiest route with over 200,000 annual passengers to Amsterdam Schiphol. In 2011, Ryanair announced that Billund Airport with effect from 25 March 2012 would be the base for two Boeing 737 aircraft. At the same time Ryanair published five new routes, so that, from the summer of 2012, they would fly to 19 destinations. From 1 January 2007 the owners are: Vejle Municipality (34.3%), Kolding Municipality (25.9%), Billund Municipality (15%), Horsens Municipality (10.7%), Fredericia Municipality (6.9%), Hedensted Municipality (6.1%), Brande Municipality (1.0%) and Skanderborg Municipality (0.1%). In 2014, LEGO produced a special Lego Architecture kit, which could only be bought in the departure hall of the airport. A new terminal was slated to open in the fall of 2019.https://jyllands-posten.dk/#ia11551519;finans It cost more than 100 million Danish kroner. Capabilities The airport handles an average of more than three million passengers a year, and millions of pounds of cargo. The airport's main runway can handle airliners as large as the Boeing 747, although most passengers arrive on smaller aeroplanes, such as ATR-72s, Boeing 737s and Airbus A320s. Boeing 747 activity at this airport is almost exclusively limited to cargo flights. Airlines and destinations The following airlines operate regular scheduled and charter flights to and from Billund:billund-airport.com - Timetables retrieved 26 February 2017 Ground transport Check-in hall The road distance is to Billund , to Vejle , to Kolding , to Esbjerg and to Aarhus . There are airport buses to Horsens, Skanderborg and Aarhus. Eight additional bus services operate from the airport. There are six parking zones named after countries of the world, USA, Australia, Kenya, Spain, Egypt and Greenland. Three of the zones are connected by a shuttle bus, the other three being within walking distance. A rail link to Billund via the airport is currently in planning stages.

The pre-Interstate 805 boundary of North Park was widely considered to be 35th Street, which is now part of City Heights. It includes the sub-neighborhoods of Burlingame, Altadena, and the Morley Field area (site of the Dryden Historic District). North Park is part of the 53rd congressional district, and San Diego City Council District 3. The \\"community\\" of North Park as defined for planning purposes includes University Heights on the north and Juniper Canyon as the southern boundary, thus including as far southeast as Cedar Ridge Park in the officially defined community. The North Park sign can be seen at 30th Street and University Avenue, and this intersection is often considered to be the heart of the neighborhood.  History  In the summer of 1893, San Diego merchant Joseph Nash sold of land northeast of Balboa Park to James Monroe Hartley, who wished to develop a lemon grove. The Hartley family began the arduous process of clearing the land to prepare the earth for the grove, but providing the fledgling trees with proper irrigation was always a problem. Barrels of water had to be hauled from downtown San Diego up a wagon trail that would eventually be called Pershing Drive. As the growth of San Diego eventually caught up with the original Hartley lemon grove, it eventually became roughly bordered by Ray Street to the west, 32nd Street to the east, University Avenue to the north and Dwight Street to the south. Hartley deemed his area \\"Hartley's North Park\\" - and years later, the name evidently stuck as the City of San Diego referred to the new suburb as \\"North Park.\\" In 1911, Hartley's eldest son, Jack, and a relative (brother-in-law William Jay Stevens) developed the plot into one of San Diego's first residential and commercial districts. After first establishing \\"Stevens & Hartley\\", North Park's first real estate firm, in 1905, Jack and William built North Park's first \\"high rise\\" commercial building, the Stevens building, on the northwest corner of 30th Street and University Avenue (today's \\"Western Dental\\" building) in 1912. \\"Thirtieth & University\\" became North Park's symbolic place name - and within 10 years, this became the heart of the community.NorthParkHistory.orghttp://www.northparkhistory.org/documents/brochures/OnceUponATimeBrochure%20Final.pdf Later in the 1910s, North Park became one of the many San Diego neighborhoods connected by the Class 1 streetcars and an extensive San Diego public transit system that was spurred by the Panama-California Exposition of 1915 and built by John D. Spreckels. These streetcars became a fixture of this neighborhood until their retirement in 1949.SD MTS history North Park was the site of the crash of PSA Flight 182, California's deadliest aviation accident to date.San Diego Union, Sept. 22, 2008  Architecture  Although North Park 92104 is a neighborhood of mixed architectural styles from many eras, one area of note is the Morley Field area of North Park. Named for its proximity to Balboa Park's Morley Field Sports Complex, this area is lined with turn-of-the-century Craftsman Bungalows and California Bungalows. Because many of the homes were designed by renowned designer and builder David Owen Dryden, the area is the site of the \\"Dryden Historic District.\\" This historical district includes the homes along 28th and Pershing Streets, both bordered on the south by Upas Street and to the north by Landis Street. North Park Dryden Historic District was approved by Historical Resources Board on June 23, 2011 An application for designation of 28th Street and Pershing Avenue from Upas to Landis Streets as a historic district was filed with the City of San Diego Historical Resources Board in May 2007. In September 2008, City staff requested additional information. The Working Group submitted a Supplemental Application in January 2009. The Supplemental Application discusses why the neighborhood reflects significant elements of North Park's development, justifies the proposed district boundaries and nominates Edward F. Bryans, who built more than a dozen homes in the proposed district, as a Master Builder.http://www.northparkhistory.org/projects/#Dryden On June 23, 2011, the City's Historical Resources Board (HRB) approved, by a vote of 8-0, establishment of the North Park Dryden Historic District and also approved Edward F.

Her writing is noted for its wit and promotion of equality of education and occupation for women. Biography Mary Abigail Dodge was born March 31, 1833, in Hamilton, Massachusetts. She was born on a farm, the seventh child of Hannah and James Dodge. A childhood accident left her blind in one eye.Goodman, Susan.

She graduated in 1850, and proceeded to teach there for four years, until she got a position at Hartford Female Seminary. She disliked the job, however, and decided to write poetry. Editor Gamaliel Bailey read her work in 1856 and, by 1858, she had moved to Washington, D. C. to serve as a governess for his children.Newman, Louise Michele. White Women's Rights: The Racial Origins of Feminism in the United States. New York: Oxford University Press, 1999: 79. From there, she sent in her publications to anti-slavery newspapers. She disliked attention, however, and chose the pen name Gail Hamilton, combining the last part of her middle name with her place of birth. Among her writings were political commentaries, making her one of the first female political correspondents in Washington.Newman, Louise Michele. White Women's Rights: The Racial Origins of Feminism in the United States. New York: Oxford University Press, 1999: 80. Her essays were best known for their harshness towards men. In 1860, after Bailey's death, Dodge returned to her native town and contributed to The Atlantic Monthly. Her father died in 1864 and she helped support her mother until she died in 1868. By 1871, she returned to Washington to live with the family of James G. Blaine, who was married to her first cousin, but returned to Hamilton in summers. Dodge became known for her personality as much as her writing. When asked for a description for a compilation about eminent women of the day, she responded with a variation of Edgar Allan Poe's poem \\"The Bells\\" that she was \\"Neither man nor woman / I am neither brute nor human / I am a ghoul!\\" One of her admirers later wrote, \\"She is incisive, even combative, by nature, and thoroughly enjoys a good, hot old- fashioned controversies.\\" Dodge was also interested in publishing matters and criticized the assumption that women writers were \\"an eternal child\\" when it came to understanding the business side of authorship.Everton, Michael J. The Grand Chorus of Complain: Authors and the Business Ethics of American Publishing. New York, NY: Oxford University Press, 2011: 151. In 1868, after reading an article in The Congregationalist titled \\"Pay of Authors\\", she realized her royalty payment of 15 cents per book sold was less than the average author pay of 10%. She wrote to her publisher James Thomas Fields, who initially ignored her, eventually claimed that he spent more money on publishing and advertising her books than average.Goodman, Susan. Republic of Words: The Atlantic Monthly and Its Writers 1857‚Äì1925. Lebanon, NH: University Press of New England, 2011: 70‚Äì71.

She abruptly ended her friendship with Ticknor's wife Annie Adams Fields in February 1868, and Mrs. Fields eventually destroyed all the letters from her former friend. In her journal a month later, she wrote of her distress, \\"We do not forget to feel still the savagery... of Gail Hamilton... I really thought she cared for me!

Early life Palwankar Baloo was born in Chambhar caste into Dharwad, Bombay Presidency, British. His father was a sepoy in the 112th Infantry Regiment of British Indian Army. Baloo played cricket with equipment left behind by officers stationed in Pune. Baloo had three brothers, Palwankar Shivram, Vithal Palwankar and Palwankar Ganpat, who later became known as cricket players. Cricket career He started working as a groundsman maintaining the pitch for the Parsis in Pune and later at the British Poona Gymkhana where he occasionally bowled to J.G Grieg, an English batsman. He learned spin bowling.and because of Grieg's influence he began to play for the Pune Hindu club. The club had been reluctant to let him play because of his \\"untouchable\\" caste.. In 1896, he moved to Bombay and got selected into Parmanandas Jivandas Hindu Gymkhana and played both Bombay Quadrangular tournaments. He got a job in the Bombay Berar and Central Indian Railways and also played for its corporate cricket team. He played in all- Indian team of 'Maharaja of Patiala' to tour England in 1911, the tour was a failure, but Baloo's outstanding performance was well praised. Throughout his career in cricket Baloo was not equal. He faced much discrimination because of his caste. Whilst he played at Pune, during the tea interval at matches his tea was brought outside to him in a disposable cup. He could not drink it in the pavilion. His lunch was served at a separate table. If he wanted to wash his face a fellow Dalit attendant would bring him water in a corner. Things seem to have improved when he moved to Bombay and afterwards but he was denied the captaincy of the Hindu team in the Quadrangular Tournament.Ramchandra Guha : Pages 89-91 and 126-130 He is considered to be one of the greatest cricketers in Indian cricket history. Politics *He was greatly influenced by Gandhian ideology and worked to bring Home Rule to India. *In the 1910s, Palwankar Baloo met Dr. B.R. Ambedkar and became his close friend. Both of them admired each other and worked to improve the Dalit community. *In 1932, Baloo opposed Dr. Ambedkar's demand for Separate Electorates for the Depressed Classes. Later, he also signed the \\"Rajah-Moonje Pact\\" in opposition. He commented conversion of Dalits into other religions as 'suicidal' when Ambedkar expressed his views to convert into Buddhism. *In 1933, Baloo unsuccessfully contested in the Bombay Municipality constituency from Hindu Mahasabha. *In 1937, Baloo joined Congress and contested the Bombay Legislative Assembly elections against Dr.B.R. Ambedkar, but lost. He died in 1955 and funeral was attended by many national leaders as well as cricketers.

History As early as 1597, records can be found in Steenhuffel's archives detailing a manor named Den Hoorn. The first signs of brewing activity at Steenhuffel came in 1747. A deed of census mentions two breweries, De Hoorn and De Valck. De Hoorn, owned then by Jean-Baptiste De Mesmaecker, was later to develop into the brewery we know today. In 1908, Henriette De Mesmaecker, great-granddaughter of Jean-Baptiste De Mesmaecker, married Arthur Van Roy. Arthur Van Roy oversaw the running of their pub and farm, and eventually became the driving force behind the construction of the brewery as we know it today. The De Hoorn brewery was not spared the violence of World War I, and although it was completely destroyed in 1914, Van Roy decided to rebuild it. He chose to still top-ferment his beer in the old Brabant style rather than brew it using newer methods, such as those used to brew Pilsner. In 1929, Van Roy decided to give his beer a proper name, calling it Speciale Palm. Speciale refers to the style of beer \\"Special Belge\\". In 1930 Arthur Van Roy taught his son, Alfred, how to brew beer. This, coupled with what Alfred learned at the Brussels brewing school, led to the first copper brewing room with a mill being built.

It overlooks the west side of Conception Bay and had a history long tied to fishing and shipbuilding. Since the late 20th century, its economy has changed to emphasize education, health care and retail. As of 2016, there were 4,838 people in the community. History Former Post Office. The town of Carbonear is one of the oldest permanent settlements in Newfoundland and among the oldest European settlements in North America. The harbour appears on early Portuguese maps as early as the late 1500s as Cabo Carvoeiro (later anglicized as Cape Carviero). There are a number of different theories about the origin of the town's name. Possibly from the Spanish word \\"carbonera\\" (charcoal kiln); Carbonera, a town near Venice, Italy where John Cabot (Giovanni Caboto) had been resident; or from a number of French words, most likely \\"Carbonnier\\" or \\"Charbonnier,\\" meaning \\"coalman.\\" In the late 20th century, historian Alwyn Ruddock of the University of London, one of the world's foremost experts on John Cabot's expeditions to the New World, suggested that a group of reformed Augustinian friars, led by the high-ranking Giovanni Antonio de Carbonariis, accompanied Cabot on his second voyage to reach North America in 1498. (Italian bankers had helped finance Cabot's previous expeditions.) The friars stayed to establish a mission community in Newfoundland for the Augustinian order of the Carbonara. She believed that the settlement may have been short- lived but built a church. The modern name of the town may be derived from the order and its church. If true, Carbonear would have been the first Christian settlement of any kind in North America, and the site of the oldest, and only, medieval church built on the continent.Evan T. Jones (2008), \\"Alwyn Ruddock: John Cabot and the Discovery of America \\", first published online 5 April 2007, Historical Research, Volume 81, Issue 212, May 2008, pp. 242‚Äì9. Evan Jones of the University of Bristol is leading further investigations of Dr Ruddock's claims to find additional evidence with colleagues in what is known as The Cabot Project.\\"The Cabot Project\\", University of Bristol, 2009 By the time the British began permanent colonization of the island in the early 17th century, the name Carbonear was already being used by the seasonal fishermen familiar with the area. Most of the area's land had been granted to Sir Percival Willoughby. One of Carbonear's first residents was Nicholas Guy, co- founder of the first British colony in Canada at Cuper's Cove (now Cupids), founder of the Bristol's Hope Colony (now Harbour Grace), and father of the first English child born in Canada. He moved there from the other colonies by no later 1631 to fish and farm the land with his family in an agreement with Willoughby. The Guy family continued as the predominant planter family in Carbonear throughout the 17th century. At about this time legend tells of an Irish princess of the O'Conner family, Sheila NaGeira, who settled in Carbonear after being rescued by privateer Peter Easton and marrying his first officer Gilbert Pike. Much is known about Easton and his exploits, but evidence of NaGeira has yet to be found. The legend's combination of romance, pirates, and New World adventure has inspired much research and numerous works of fiction on the topic. By the late 17th century, unlike many settlements in Newfoundland from this period where men outnumbered the women by a ratio of ten to one, Carbonear was a true community with families, and many women and children to help develop the town's prosperity. It became a target for England's enemies, and privateers. When war broke out with France, Carbonear was attacked by French captain Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville during the Avalon Peninsula Campaign. The citizens survived by retreating to the fortified Carbonear Island, but the town, documented by the French as being \\"very well- established\\" and containing properties that were \\"the best-built in all of Newfoundland\\", was burned to the ground. During four months of raids, Iberville was responsible for the destruction of thirty-six Newfoundland settlements. By the end of March 1697, only Bonavista and Carbonear Island remained in English hands. Fortifications at Carbonear Island, 1750 Over the next hundred years, Carbonear was attacked and burned two more times by the French in their attempts to control Newfoundland, and then later by American privateers. The residents continued to improve the fortifications using their own money and although the town was repeatedly burned, Carbonear Island protected its residents. The town developed as one of the most important in Newfoundland in this period. When Judiciary districts were set up to govern the island in 1729 by Commodore Governor Henry Osborn, Carbonear was recognized and was chosen as one of the six initial districts. With new French threats, the British finally erected a fort and garrison on the Island in 1743. During the Seven Years' War, the French invaded and gained control of the fort, burning its buildings and tossing the cannons over the cliffs in 1762. They can still be seen on the beach below. The Archaeology of Historic Carbonear Project, carried out by Memorial University of Newfoundland, has conducted summer fieldwork each season since 2011 in the town to reveal its colonial history. So far, it has found evidence of planter habitation since the late 17th century and of trade with Spain through Bilbao, including a Spanish coin minted in Peru. It has found evidence of other settlement through the 19th century.Peter E. Pope and Bryn Tapper, \\"Historic Carbonear, Summer 2013\\", Provincial Archaeology Office 2013 Archaeology Review, Vol. 12-2013, accessed 24 April 2015Mark Rendell, \\"17th-century coins unearthed in Carbonear\\" , The Telegram, 17 April 2014, accessed 24 April 2015 The first summer's work uncovered approximately 1300 artifacts. The Carbonear Heritage Society is developing an interpretive museum exhibit for these and future finds. With the rise of the seal hunt and the Labrador cod fishery, Carbonear became a major commercial centre in the 19th century. More sea captains came from Carbonear for the foreign fishing trade than from any other Newfoundland outport in this era. Violent political riots here in the early and mid-19th century led to the dissolution of the Newfoundland Legislature in 1841 and the suspension of the constitution. Political riots were so common here during this period, especially during elections, that the term Carbonearism was coined to describe the behaviour.PANL, Newfoundland, Executive Council, Minutes, 1 March 1862.

Rail service began in 1898 (with a 1st class ticket to St. John's costing $2) and expanded with a new rail station in 1917. It operated until the closure of the rail line in 1984. In the late 20th century, the economy was forced to diversify. The seal hunt and the Labrador fishery had almost disappeared. Carbonear's importance as a shipbuilding centre and international port of trade had much declined. Fish processing continued to be the primary industry until the collapse of the cod fishery in the early 1990s. The fish processing plant has been converted to process crab and most recently seal. To counter these changes, Carbonear is evolving. With two college campuses, a shopping centre, a major hospital, and three long-term care facilities, the town has built on its importance as a regional retail, service, transportation, government, and cultural centre, earning it the nickname \\"Hub of the Bay\\". =Timeline= * 1630s - 1640s - Mary Weymouth is listed as running a plantation in Carbonear. * 1631 - Nicholas Guy, formerly of Cupids, is settled at Carbonear with his family. * 1675 - Census records 11 permanent residents, 16 children, 8 boats, and 30 servants living year round in Carbonear. * 1679 ‚Äì William Downing and Thomas Oxford propose to fortify \\"Carboniere\\" on behalf of the residents. * 1697 ‚Äì The settlement consisting of 22 houses is destroyed by the French.

He has been involved in politics since 2009 as the co-founder (together with Gianroberto Casaleggio) of the Italian Five Star Movement political party. Grillo became one of the most prominent examples of the populist surge which arose in Europe during the 2010s.Beppe Grillo: populist who could throw Italy into turmoil at general election, The Guardian Early life and career Grillo was born in Genoa, Liguria, on 21 July 1948. He studied as an accountant but did not finish university. After high school, he became a comedian by chance, improvising a monologue in an audition. Two weeks later, he was discovered by Italian television presenter Pippo Baudo. Grillo participated in the variety show Secondo Voi from 1977 to 1978. In 1979, he participated in Luna Park by Enzo Trapani, and in the variety show Fantastico. In the 1980s he appeared in the shows Te la do io l'America (1982, four episodes) and Te lo do io il Brasile (1984, six episodes), in which he narrated his experiences of visits to the United States and Brazil. This led to his appearance as the protagonist of another show, developed especially for him, called Grillometro (Grillometer). In 1986, he appeared in a series of prize-winning advertisements for a brand of yoghurt. Beppe Grillo (on the right) with Pippo Baudo during the 1980s Soon afterwards, his performances began to include political satire that offended some Italian politicians. In 1986 during the Saturday night television show Fantastico 7, he attacked the Italian Socialist Party and its leader Bettino Craxi, then Italy's Prime Minister, on the occasion of his visit to the People's Republic of China (PRC). As a consequence, Grillo was effectively banished from publicly owned television. =Exile from television= Grillo alongside with Anna Oxa and Stefania Casini in 1978 Since the early 1990s Grillo's appearances on television became rare; according to Mark Franchetti, politicians were offended by his jokes.Mark Franchetti, The Berlusconi Show, BBC documentary first aired 17 March 2010. Franchetti states: \\"it is telling that he [Grillo] has not been allowed back on the networks, dominated by Berlusconi and his allies.\\" When one of his shows was allowed to be broadcast live by RAI in 1993, it obtained a record share of 15 million viewers. Grillo often accuses the public broadcaster RAI of \\"public financing for the parties\\" that abuse it for their own propagandist needs. Grillo also took aim at the Italian Socialist Party, which directly led to him having less television appearance after the mid 1980s. Grillo also criticized Biagio Agnes, then the director of the STET, for dishonest business practices. By the early 1990s, Grillo was known for his anti-establishment comedy as well as the denunciation of public policies. While it did give him attention and the beginning of his political base, it also directly led him to the lack of television appearances. Despite this exile, excerpts from Grillo's Five Star Movement political rallies are often broadcast on television, especially on political debate talk shows. On 19 May 2014, Grillo returned to Italian public television, RAI to participate in the popular late-night political debate talk show Porta a Porta as part of his campaign for the 2014 European Parliament election. The program attracted three million viewers. , Grillo performs on stage in Italy and abroad. His themes include energy use, political and corporate corruption, finance, freedom of speech, child labour, globalization and technology. =Blog and web enthusiasm= Looking for another outlet, Grillo eventually turned to the internet. This started when Grillo met a manager of a small internet firm named Gianroberto Casaleggio. He expanded his influence to a larger audience with his website beppegrillo.it once the site was launched in January 2005. The internet was seen as an alternative source for media which ran contrary to the mainstream media. Hence, Grillo was able to gain many followers who became disillusioned with mainstream Italian media. Over time, it also became seen as the \\"headquarters\\" of the Five Star Movement and the main hub of its activity, rather than a physical location. A year after its launch, it became recognized by Time magazine as one of the most influential websites to date. Despite the website's success, there have been a number of other websites used to ramp up support for Grillo. One such site by the name of meetup.com was used to organize rallies and campaigns making Grillo's progress even more apparent. The website was also used to discuss the political stances of Grillo as well as any other politically affiliated topic referring to Grillo. Grillo maintains a blog in Italian, English, and Japanese that is updated daily. According to Technorati, the blog ranks among the 10 most visited in the world. In 2008, The Guardian included Grillo's blog among the world's most influential. He often receives letters from prominent figures such as Antonio Di Pietro (former Italian Minister of Infrastructures), Fausto Bertinotti (former President of the Italian Chamber of Deputies), Renzo Piano, and Nobel Prize Winners including Dario Fo, Joseph E. Stiglitz, the Dalai Lama and Muhammad Yunus. As Grillo became more and more involved in Italian politics, the use of his blog to convey a political message was accompanied by a strong emphasis on the role of the Web as the harbinger of new possibilities for direct democracy and for a fairer society, making Grillo one of the leading popularisers of digital utopianism in Italy. As of mid December 2017, the English and Japanese versions of the blog seem permanently defunct. The last entry in the English section is from November 2015, and in Japanese from October 2011. The Italian version, however, continues to be updated daily. Political career =Activism= Beppe Grillo in Bologna speaking at V-Day. On 1 September 2005, Grillo used money donated by readers of his blog to buy a full-page advertisement in the Italian newspaper La Repubblica, in which he called for the resignation of the Bank of Italy's then governor Antonio Fazio over the Antonveneta banking scandal. In October 2005, Time chose him as one of the \\"European Heroes 2005\\" for targeting corruption and financial scandals.Jeff Israely, \\"Seriously Funny\\" (article on Beppo Grillo), TIME Magazine, 2 October 2005. On 22 November 2005, Grillo bought a page in the International Herald Tribune, saying that members of the Italian Parliament ought not to represent citizens if they have been convicted of a crime, even in the first degree of the three available in the Italian system. He maintains a regularly updated list of members of the Italian Parliament who have been convicted in all three degrees on his blog.\\"Clean Parliament\\" , list of convicted felons in the Italian parliament. On 26 July 2007, Grillo was permitted to speak to the members of the European Parliament in Brussels, where he drew attention to the state of Italian politics. =V movement= Grillo has led several national and international political campaigns. On 8 September 2007, he organized a \\"V‚ÄëDay Celebration\\" in Italy; the \\"V\\" stood for vaffanculo (\\"fuck off\\"). During the rally, he projected the names of 24 Italian politicians who had been convicted of crimes including corruption, tax evasion and abetting a murder. More than 2 million Italians participated in this rally. He also used the rally to urge Italians to sign a petition calling for the introduction of a \\"Bill of Popular Initiative\\" to remove from office Italian parliamentarians with criminal convictions.\\"Clean Up Parliament!\\" Beppe Grillo's Blog. According to Internet scholars Alberto Pepe and Corinna Di Gennaro, V‚Äëday was the first political demonstration in Italy developed and promoted via the blogosphere and the social networking services.Alberto Pepe and Corinna Di Gennaro. \\"Political protest Italian‚Äìstyle: The blogosphere and mainstream media in the promotion and coverage of Beppe Grillo‚Äôs V‚Äìday\\". First Monday. Vol. 14, Number 12, 7 December 2009. The second V-Day took place on 25 April 2008, in Turin, San Carlo Square, dedicated to the Italian press and the financial support it receives from the government. Grillo strongly criticized the Italian press for the lack of freedom, Umberto Veronesi for his support for incinerators, NATO bases in Italy, politicians (Silvio Berlusconi had recently been re-elected), and the television channel Retequattro for retaining frequencies assigned to Europa 7.. In August 2008, Grillo was the subject of a report on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's international affairs program Foreign Correspondent. Entitled \\"The Clown Prince\\", the report profiled Grillo's life, political activism, the V‚ÄëDay campaign and use of the internet as a political tool. = Five Star Movement = Beppe Grillo in Rome during the tour 2014. In 2010, he started a political movement, Movimento 5 Stelle, the \\"Five Star Movement\\" to promote through the Internet his ideals about honesty and direct democracy. The movement became a party with electoral prospects during the 2010 regional elections, with four regional councillors being elected. The party made further gains at the 2012 local elections, receiving the third highest number of votes overall and winning the mayoral election for Parma. At the 2013 general election the M5S won 25.5% of votes, the second most popular one for the Chamber of Deputies, but obtained just 109 deputies out of 630 due to an electoral system which favoured parties running in coalition. In the European Parliament the M5S is part of the Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy (EFDD) group. In 2014, Grillo announced that he was aiming to get four million signatures to support his attempts to get a referendum on Italy's membership of the Eurozone. He collected around 200,000 signatures while the minimum is 500,000 but he announced that his project was going on despite the failure. In June 2018, Grillo published a post on his blog in which he called for selecting the members of the Italian Senate through sortition, and possibly eventually replacing elections with sortition altogether. Legal issues On 7 December 1981 Beppe Grillo lost control of a Chevrolet K5 Blazer as he drove on a military road, forbidden to civilians, from Limone Piemonte to Colle di Tenda. Six kilometers after \\"Quota 1400\\" near the border with France the vehicle slipped on a sheet of ice and fell 80 meters into a deep ravine. In the car with Grillo were four of his Genoese friends, with whom he was spending the weekend of Immaculate Conception. Grillo saved himself out of the passenger compartment before the car dropped into the void and in state of shock he managed to call for help. Three of his friends in the car lost their lives: Renzo Giberti and Rossana Quartapelle, respectively 45 and 33, and their 9-year-old son Francesco. On 14 March 1985 Grillo was found guilty of manslaughter.. In 2003, he settled a libel suit for defamation filed against him by Rita Levi-Montalcini. During a show, Beppe Grillo called the 94-year-old winner of the 1986 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine and Italian Senator for Life (2001‚Äì2012) an \\"old whore\\". When Italian judges were investigating the Parmalat scandal, which was then the world's largest corporate bankruptcy scandal, Grillo was called to testify because he had anticipated the imminent collapse of the dairy conglomerate in one of his shows. When the judges asked how he had been able to discover that, he said that Parmalat's financial holes were so evident that anybody who had enough ability to see them would see them, since the corporate accounting was easily accessible.Grillo testifies on Parmalat crack: \\"I brought also Fiat and Telecom [Italia\\"], from La Repubblica, January 16, 2004 In 2012 Grillo was convicted of having defamed Fininvest in an article published in 2004 in the Italian magazine Internazionale . The compensation, equal to 50,000 euros, in addition to the costs of the proceedings, was established by the judges of the first section of the court of appeal of the court of Rome. On September 2013 he was sentenced for defaming the former mayor of Asti and parliamentary for Forza Italia, Giorgio Galvagno. In 2003, Grillo had called Galvagno \\"a briber\\" during a performance at the Teatro Alfieri in Asti. Grillo had to pay Galvagno 25,000 euros and interest from 2003 as compensation for damages, plus compensation for legal costs. On 12 December 2013 the Tribunal of Genoa sentenced Grillo in the first instance for defamation against Antonio Misiani, treasurer of the Democratic Party. In May 2012, Grillo published on the front page of his blog a mosaic of pictures with photographs of the PdL (Rocco Crimi), PD (Antonio Misiani) and UDC (Giuseppe Naro) administrators, along with those of former Lega Nord (Francesco Belsito) and The Daisy (Luigi Lusi). The judge has provisionally recognized a compensation for Misiani and a compensation for the Democratic Party of 5000 euros. On 14 September 2015 he was convicted by the tribunal of Ascoli Piceno for aggravated defamation against Franco Battaglia, professor at the University of Modena, to a term of imprisonment with suspended sentence, ‚Ç¨1,250 fine and a provisional fee of ‚Ç¨50,000 to the offender. In that occasion Grillo compared himself to Nelson Mandela and Sandro Pertini. On 31 March 2017 Grillo was formally investigated along with Alessandro Di Battista for defamation following a police report filed by Marika Cassimatis, former candidate mayor of the M5S in Genoa. On 11 July 2017 Grillo was convicted at the third and higher judgement level by the tribunal of Ancona to a payment of 6,000 euros, a provisional amount of 50,000 euros and payment of legal fees, raised to 12,000 euros for defamation against Professor Franco Battaglia. Over the years, Grillo has accumulated a number of fines and/or convictions for building abuse and other crimes, such as attempted instigation to disobedience by inviting police officers to stop protecting politicians. Criticism Beppe Grillo during a show in 2018 Grillo is often criticized for his lifestyle. In particular, critics blame him for owning a motor yacht and a Ferrari sports car, in contradiction with his environmentalist stance. In his blog he said he acquired both but has since sold them. He defended himself from similar attacks from the leader of the Democratic Party on this subject, saying he earned his pay over the years and paid his taxes on them. (22 February 2013). Retrieved 24 August 2013. Grillo was also criticized for having taken advantage of the Condono Tombale, a fiscal amnesty granted by the first Berlusconi government in 2001, which Grillo had publicly opposed.\\"Grillo, the 'Great Moralist' seduced by the fiscal amnesty\\", from Il Giornale, 18 November 2005. Note that Il Giornale is owned by Silvio Berlusconi's brother, Paolo. Grillo said during the V‚ÄëDay demonstration that he had personally benefited by only ‚Ç¨500. Grillo has proposed that members of the Italian Parliament who have a criminal record should be banned from public office. Because Grillo was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter caused by a car accident, he cannot run for public office as a member of his own party, which prohibits those who have a criminal record from being candidates. He says he is not interested in becoming a member of the Italian Parliament. Despite this, in July 2009 he announced his intention to present himself as a candidate for the PD's primary elections, which does not imply automatic presence in the Italian parliament. He also proposed that MPs should be limited to two government terms of office, after which they may not stand again. Grillo is also criticized as being a demagogue who attacks politicians on superficial issues and their private lives, while being unable to provide a valid alternative. For example, stand-up comedian Daniele Luttazzi criticized him in 2007 in an open letter published on the website of the news magazine MicroMega. Luttazzi accused Grillo of being a \\"demagogue\\" and a \\"populist\\", suggesting Grillo should choose between satire and politics.Daniele Luttazzi talks about Beppe Grillo on Micromega, from Il Corriere della Sera, 13 September 2007. In March 2013 a commentary piece in Der Spiegel called Grillo \\"The most dangerous man in Europe\\", described his rhetoric as anti-democratic, said he derived his energy from resentment, and cited the British writer Nicholas Farrell who has drawn parallels between Grillo and Benito Mussolini.Jan Fleischhauer, \\"Green Fascism: Beppe Grillo of Italy Is the Most Dangerous Man in Europe\\" ‚Äì Spiegel Online (15 March 2013).

Friedman that posits that the world is currently undergoing two struggles: the drive for prosperity and development, symbolized by the Lexus LS, and the desire to retain identity and traditions, symbolized by the olive tree.  Narrative  Friedman explains \\"globalization\\" by recounting stories of his actual experiences in interfacing with many of the global movers and shakers. He proposes that \\"globalization is not simply a trend or fad but is, rather, an international system. It is the system that has replaced the old Cold War system, and, like that Cold War System, globalization has its own rules and logic that today directly or indirectly influence the politics, environment, geopolitics and economics of virtually every country in the world.\\" The \\"Big Idea\\" in The Lexus and the Olive Tree is found on page 223 where Friedman explains that: \\"if you can't see the world, and you can't see the interactions that are shaping the world, you surely cannot strategize about the world.\\" He states that \\"you need a strategy for how to choose prosperity for your country or company.\\" Golden Arches theory The book puts forward a capitalist peace theory, first published as an opinion piece in The New York Times in December 1996, called the Golden Arches Theory of Conflict Prevention; although slightly tongue-in-cheekFriedman, Thomas. (2005) The Guardian, 21 April 2005., it states: > No two countries that both had McDonald's had fought a war against each > other since each got its McDonald's. He supported that observation, as a theory, by stating that when a country has reached an economic development where it has a middle class strong enough to support a McDonald's network, it would become a \\"McDonald's country\\", and will not be interested in fighting wars anymore. Friedman's point is that due to globalization, countries that have made strong economic ties with one another have too much to lose to ever go to war with one another. Regardless of whether the statement is true, the conclusions to be drawn are unclear. The global expansion of McDonald's restaurants is a relatively recent phenomenon when put into the context of the history of warfare, and, with a few notable exceptions, has proceeded into relatively stable markets. Shortly after the book was published, NATO bombed Yugoslavia. On the first day of the bombing, McDonald's restaurants in Belgrade were demolished by the Serbian people and were rebuilt only after the bombing ended. In the 2000 edition of the book, Friedman argued that this exception proved the rule: the war ended quickly, he argued, partly because the Serbian population did not want to lose their place in a global system \\"symbolised by McDonald's\\" (Friedman 2000: 252-253). Critics have pointed to other conflicts as counterexamples, depending on what one considers \\"a war\\": * The 1989 United States invasion of Panama * In 1999, India and Pakistan fought a war over Kashmir, known as the Kargil War. Both countries had (and continue to have) McDonald's restaurants. Although the war was not fought in all possible theatres (such as the Rajasthan and Punjab borders), both countries mobilised their military all along their common borders and both countries made threats involving their nuclear capabilities. * The 2006 war between Israel and Lebanon, following hostilities ongoing since 1973, with South Lebanon occupied until May 2000. (McDonald's franchises were established in Israel and Lebanon in 1993 and 1998, respectively.) However, the Lebanese Armed Forces were not a party to the fighting, the Israel Defense Forces action being taken instead against the paramilitary group Hezbollah. * The 2008 South Ossetia war between Russia and Georgia. Both countries had McDonald's at the time (restaurants began in the two countries in 1990 and 1999, respectively).Russia, Georgia, and IR Theory: Part 1, Lawyers, Guns, and Money (featuring photos of McDonald's in both countries) * The 2014 Crimean crisis between Russia and Ukraine. Both countries had McDonald's at the time. In the 2000 edition of the book, Friedman evaded criticism of his theory as follows: :I was both amazed and amused by how much the Golden Arches Theory had gotten around and how intensely certain people wanted to prove it wrong. They were mostly realists and out-of-work Cold Warriors who insisted that politics, and the never-ending struggle between nation-states, were the immutable defining feature of international affairs, and they were professionally and psychologically threatened by the idea that globalization and economic integration might actually influence geopolitics in some very new and fundamental ways.The Lexus and the Olive Tree, 2000 edition(Anchor Books )p. 251. He also explains how globalization can cause Brazilification‚Äîthe loss of the middle class and increase in income gap‚Äîof countries impacted by the trend. Brazilification is a neologism included in Douglas Coupland's 1991 book Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture.Generation X Neo-logisms The expression was used in a similar way by the American writer Michael Lind as \\"Brazilianisation of America\\" in his book The Next American Nation and by the German sociologist Ulrich Beck as \\"Brasilianisierung des Westens\\" in his book Sch√∂ne neue Arbeitswelt (translated title: Brave new world of work). In 2005, Friedman said that he framed this theory in terms of McDonald's Golden Arches \\"with tongue slightly in cheek\\".Friedman, Thomas. (2005) The Guardian, 21 April 2005. In his 2005 book The World is Flat he offered an updated theory he labelled the Dell Theory of Conflict Prevention. The instagram account @makebigmacsnotwar picked up on Friedman's theory. The instagrammer takes pictures of McDonald's outlets at locations around the world and investigates whether these locations follow the theory's concept.

Plot A German high school student, Sonja (Lena Stolze as a fictionalized version of Anna Rosmus) wins an essay contest and goes on a trip to Paris. Martin Wegmus begins teaching physics at Sonja's school and one of Sonja's classmates falls in love with him. Almost by luck, Mr. Wegmus and Sonja kiss. The teacher promises to return for her. The next year, she enters the contest again. She chooses \\"My Town During the Third Reich\\" from the possible topics. Her research leads her to discover that her picture-perfect town had been intimately involved in the Third Reich and that nearly all of the city's prominent families were members of the Nazi party long before it came to power. As she digs further, local authorities stonewall her efforts. Sonja persists and learns that there had been eight concentration camps in the area and that all the Jews were forced out of the town and had their property confiscated. Sonja marries Martin and the townsfolk think Sonja has dropped the issue of Nazi involvement. Sonja bears two daughters and studies history at the University. She resumes her research into the town's Nazi past and wins court cases granting her access to archives. She still has to employ trickery to get the information she wants. The townsfolks' hostility grows from verbal abuse, to death threats to physical assaults as they attempt to silence her with increasing desperation but nothing deters her. Her husband feels emasculated as he's forced to take care of the children. The family survives a bomb attack but Sonja keeps up her research.

Club career =Arsenal= Born in Islington, London, George attended the local Grafton, Holloway Road and Hugh Myddleton Schools. George supported Arsenal as a boy and played for Islington Schoolboys before joining Arsenal in May 1966. He turned professional in 1968 and made his first-team debut on 9 August 1969 against Everton, on the first day of the 1969‚Äì70 season; Arsenal lost the match 1‚Äì0. George became a regular in the side that season making a total of 39 appearances. He was particularly prolific in Arsenal's 1969‚Äì70 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup campaign, including against Dinamo Bacau and Ajax. He played in both legs of the final against RSC Anderlecht, which Arsenal won 4‚Äì3 on aggregate. George broke his ankle at the start of the following season in a collision with Everton goalkeeper Gordon West. After being out for five months he returned to play a significant part in Arsenal's run-in to the 1970‚Äì71 Division One title, scoring five times in 17 appearances in the League. However, the highlight of his season came in the FA Cup; he scored in the fourth, fifth and sixth rounds as well as proving the difference in the final against Liverpool. With the score at 1‚Äì1 in extra time, in the 111th minute George latched onto John Radford's square ball and scored a spectacular winner from 20 yards to win the match. He celebrated by lying flat on his back with arms aloft. With that Cup win, Arsenal completed their first Double win. George was prolific in the Gunners' FA Cup run in the 1971‚Äì72 season, scoring the equalizing goal in the Cup semi-final against Stoke City which Arsenal won by a 2‚Äì1 margin at Goodison Park. In the Cup Final at Wembley, Arsenal lost to Leeds United. The latter stages of George's career with Arsenal were hampered by injuries and a rebellious streak at odds with the club's management; during the 1971‚Äì72 season he was disciplined by the club twice, first after headbutting Liverpool's Kevin Keegan, and then for flicking a V-sign at Derby County's fans after scoring away at the Baseball Ground. As the Double-winning side were gradually broken up, Arsenal began to descend down the table, and although George hit eleven goals in both 1971‚Äì72 and 1972‚Äì73 his form declined alongside Arsenal's; he only scored five times in 28 matches in 1973‚Äì74 and he was dropped from the first team in 1974‚Äì75 after falling out with manager Bertie Mee. By Christmas 1974, he had been transfer-listed, and he moved to Derby County in July 1975 for ¬£100,000. In total he played 179 times for Arsenal and scored 49 goals. George was ranked at No. 9 in a feature of Arsenal's greatest 50 players of all time. =Derby County= George played his first game for Derby County in the Charity Shield of 1975 which they won by a 2-0 margin over West Ham. He spent three and a half years at Derby, where he memorably scored a hat-trick against Real Madrid in a European Cup first leg of October 1975. Derby eventually lost the cup tie by a margin of 5‚Äì6 on aggregate in all. He later scored a hat-trick for Derby against Finn Harps in the first leg of a UEFA Cup tie in September 1976. Derby eventually altogether scored 12 goals in this match of European competition, becoming the first British club to ever do so. He also had a loan spell at St George's Budapest in Australia from Derby. George, whose exploits with the Rams earned him the chant, \\"Charlie, Charlie, the King of Derby\\", remains a legendary and beloved figure among many of the fans of Derby County. =Later career= After Derby, he went on to play for the Minnesota Kicks in the North American Soccer League. At the Kicks, George scored what was an NASL record for the fastest playoff goal in a 9‚Äì2 thumping of the New York Cosmos. In all he made 18 appearances while scoring 9 goals in the 1978 season for the club. George then returned to England with Southampton in December 1978. He then had a short period on loan to Nottingham Forest in January 1980, where he played four games. One of these included the final of the 1979 UEFA Super Cup against FC Barcelona, where he scored the only goal in the home leg as Forest won 2‚Äì1 on aggregate. George could not agree an extension to his loan at Forest and later returned to Southampton, playing his last league game for them on 14 March 1981 against Stoke City. In the summer of 1981 he left the club to move to Bulova in Hong Kong. He made a total of 52 appearances for Southampton in which he scored 14 goals. A year later, in 1982, he returned to England to have a short time at A.F.C. Bournemouth and subsequently rejoined Derby County for a second spell. He also had a brief spell later with Scottish side Dundee United. He then linked up with Coventry City on a short-term contract prior to the 1983‚Äì84 season, but made no competitive appearances and retired soon after. In April 1980, George lost a finger in a lawnmower accident.Rothman's Football Yearbook 1980‚Äì81 =After football= After retiring from football he moved to New Milton, Hampshire to run a pub. He later had joint ownership for some years in a garage business. George is now employed by Arsenal in roles within corporate hospitality at the club. International career George was capped five times for England at under-23 level. Whilst with Derby, he also won a solitary cap at senior level for England, playing for 60 minutes against the Republic of Ireland on 8 September 1976, out of position on the left wing, but fell out with coach Don Revie after being substituted and he was never picked again. Personal life At the age of 19, George married Susan Farge and with her he has a daughter, Kaana. George was mentioned by musical act Steven North and the Flat Back Four in their songs entitled \\"The Charlie George Calypso\\" and \\"I Wish I Could Play Like Charlie George\\" respectively.

It was manufactured by Canon Camera K. K. (today Canon Incorporated) in Japan from April 1978 to 1985. It employs a horizontal cloth-curtain focal-plane shutter with a speed range of 30 to 1/1000 second plus bulb and flash synchronization speed of 1/60 second. It has dimensions of height, width, depth and weight. Unlike most SLRs of the time, it was available in only one color; all black. The introductory US list price for the body plus Canon FD 50 mm f/1.4 SSC lens was $625, the camera was generally sold with a 30‚Äì40% discount (roughly $375 to $435). The A-1 is a historically significant camera. It was the first SLR to offer an electronically controlled programmed autoexposure mode. Instead of the photographer picking a shutter speed to freeze or blur motion and choosing a lens aperture f-stop to control depth of field (focus), the A-1 has a microprocessor programmed to automatically select a compromise exposure based on light meter input. Virtually all cameras today have at least one program mode.  Features  Canon A-1 with a FD 50/1.8 Viewfinder of a Canon A-1. The right number is the current F-number (1.8), meaning that the aperture is fairly wide open. The left number (45) indicates the approximate shutter speed of 45 s‚àí1; (the camera can select odd shutter speeds, but does not display them) The A-1 accepts any lens with the Canon FD breech lock mount (introduced in 1971) or Canon New FD pseudo-bayonet mount (sometimes called the FDn mount, introduced 1979). It can also use most earlier FL lenses and some even older R (or Canomatic) series lenses, albeit with reduced functionality. This excludes all of Canon's EF bayonet mount autofocus lenses (introduced in 1987). During the late 1970s and 1980s, there were approximately 55 Canon FD lenses available for purchase. They ranged from a 7.5mm f/5.6 fisheye to an FD 800mm f/5.6 telephoto, and included lenses with maximum apertures to f/1.2 and a line of L-series lenses of exceptional quality. Accessories for the A-1 included the Canon motor drive MA (automatic film advance up to 5 frames per second), the Canon Databack A (sequential numbering or date stamping on the film), and the Canon Speedlight 155A (guide number 56/17 (feet/meters) at ASA/ISO 100) and Canon Speedlight 199A (guide number 98/30 (feet/meters) at ASA/ISO 100) electronic flashes. The A-1 is a battery-powered (one 4LR44 or PX-28) microprocessor-controlled manual-focus SLR with manual exposure control or shutter priority, aperture priority or programmed autoexposure. A fifth mode is \\"stopped down AE\\", in which the aperture is closed and alterable by the photographer and the camera selects the shutter speed based on the actual light reading. This differs from aperture priority in which the aperture is not closed until a photograph is taken and the shutter speed is calculated based on the light measured through the fully open aperture. Stopped down AE existed so that old FL lenses could be used with at least some kind of AE, and was also useful for photomicroscopy, manual-aperture lenses, etc. The A-1 is the first SLR to have all four of the now standard PASM exposure modes. It has a viewfinder exposure information system using a six-digit, seven-segment per digit, red alphanumeric LED display on the bottom of the viewfinder to indicate the readings of the built-in silicon photocell light meter. It supports one metering mode, centerweighted average metering.G√ºnter Richter: das Canon reflex system, 4th edition, Laterna Magica, M√ºnchen 1980, , p. 110 The focusing screen also has Canon's standard split image rangefinder and microprism collar focusing help.  Design history  Beginning with the amateur level Canon AE-1 of 1976, there was a complete overhaul of the entire Canon SLR line. The 1970s and 1980s were an era of intense competition among the major SLR brands: Canon, Nikon, Minolta, Pentax and Olympus. Between 1975 and 1985, there was a dramatic shift away from heavy all-metal manual mechanical camera bodies to much more compact bodies with integrated circuit (IC) electronic automation. In addition, because of rapid advances in electronics, the brands continually leapfrogged each other with models having new or more automatic features, and less expensive components and assembly. The industry was trying to expand out from the saturated high-end professional market and appeal to the large mass of low-end amateur photographers keen to move up from compact automatic leaf shutter rangefinder cameras to the more \\"glamorous\\" SLR but were intimidated by the need to learn all the details of operating a traditional SLR. The A-1 is the high technology standard bearer of the landmark Canon amateur level A-series SLRs. The other members of the A-series are the Canon AE-1 (released 1976), AT-1 (1977), AV-1 (1979), AE-1 Program (1981) and AL-1 (1982). They all use the same compact aluminum alloy chassis, but with differing feature levels and outer cosmetic acrylonitrile- butadiene-styrene (ABS) plastic panels. By sharing most major components, and an inexpensive horizontal cloth-curtain shutter, costs could be spread out over a larger production volumes. The A-1 represented Canon's bid to defeat Nikon through more features and the cheapest price. The A-1 caused a sensation when it was released in early 1978. Most photographers were amazed at its advanced features, years ahead of the competition, but in the face of changing technology, not all comments were positive. Professional photographers worried about the long term reliability of its consumer-level mechanical and electronic components under heavy daily use, the relatively slow flash sync and top shutter speeds. Traditionalist photographers complained about an \\"excess\\" of automation ruining the art of photography, a criticism that was leveled at all of the newly automated cameras released in the 1980s. However, automation turned out to be the right way to entice many new amateur photographers on a budget, and paid off very well for Canon. The Canon A-1 was a runaway best seller, as it offered new SLR buyers considerable features and value for the price. It was reliable for its day in amateur usage. But as competitors brought out their own programmed SLRs,Competitors' programmed SLRs included the Nikon FA (released 1983), the Minolta X-700 (1982), virtually Minolta XD (1977) has hidden program mode because its unique \\"final check\\" metering system shift shutter speed in shutter speed priority mode when needed, Pentax Super Program (in the USA/Canada; Super A, rest of the world; 1983), the Olympus OM-2S Program (1984) and even the Ricoh XR-P (1984). the A-1 began to show its age. This is especially true for its horizontal cloth- curtain shutter, viewfinder information display and autoflash control. The A-1 was due for replacement when the Canon T90 came out in 1985. Canon's abandonment of the FD lens mount for the EOS design also had a significant effect on demand for the A-1 on the used market. But it is still regarded as one of the most fascinating SLRs of its generation and many are still in regular use.  Notes   References  * Anonymous.

In the film, Funt secretly records people's reactions to unexpected encounters with nudity or sexuality in unusual situations. While the film does contain some titillating material and both male and female full frontal nudity, a large amount of the film involves Funt talking to people about sexuality and sexual topics. Whereas Funt's other productions had to fall within Federal Communications Commission guidelines prohibiting nudity and sexual content on the airwaves, this film was outside the FCC's jurisdiction and Funt was free to incorporate them into the film. In the U.S., the film was originally rated X by the Motion Picture Association of America; an edited version was rated R in 1982. When submitted to the British Board of Film Classification in 1970, the film was originally rejected, then rated X; a 1988 video release was rated 18.

It centered on a young woman, TJ Myers, being reunited with her biological father, who had not seen her since she was born. The first of six planned episodes aired in January 2005, but low ratings and strong controversy prompted Fox to shelve the remaining episodes indefinitely. They have since appeared on Fox Reality. The show's premise was that an adult who had been put up for adoption as an infant was placed in a room with 25 men, one of whom was their biological father. If the contestant could correctly pick out who was their father, the contestant would win $100,000. If they chose incorrectly, the person that they incorrectly selected would get the $100,000, although the contestant would still be reunited with his or her father. This show drew controversy from adoption rights organizations, leading to one Fox affiliate (WRAZ in Raleigh, North Carolina) declining to air the series pilot, a 90-minute special. The first adoption contestant was actress T. J. Myers. After the pilot finished fourth in the Nielsen ratings for its time slot, Fox decided not to broadcast the other five episodes that had been produced. However, the pilot aired as a 'special' and not as a 'series premiere' so technically the series was canceled before airing an episode.

New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 4 February 2020 He was brought up in the Church of England. In 1642, he traveled to the continent with his grandfather, Thomas Howard, 14th Earl of Arundel, who had accompanied Princess Mary and her mother, Queen Henrietta Maria, to the Dutch Republic after the princess' marriage to William of Orange. In Antwerp, Philip encountered his grandmother, Alethea Howard, who was at the time living in that city. Through her influence and that of Dominican friar John-Baptist Hackett, the boy was introduced to Catholicism. Champ, Judith F. \\"Cardinal Philip Howard OP, Rome and English Recusancy\\", New Blackfriars, vol. 76, no. 894, 1995, pp. 268‚Äì279. JSTOR At the age of sixteen he joined the Dominican Order in Cremona. He was professed at Rome in 1646, taking the name Thomas. Residing at Naples for his studies, he was chosen to deliver a Latin address to the general chapter of his order in Rome. He delivered a fervent address on the conversion of England, which led to a decree being passed by the chapter, urging provincials and priors to do all they could to receive English, Irish, and Scotch novices into the order, with a view to its preservation in those countries. He was ordained in 1652. He founded the priory of Bornem in Flanders, with a college for English youths attached to it, and was himself the first prior and novice master. He also founded at Vilvoorde a convent of nuns of the Second Order of Saint Dominic, which later moved to Carisbrooke on the Isle of Wight. In the reign of Charles II, Father Howard was made grand almoner to Queen Catherine of Braganza. He resided at St. James's Palace, with a salary of 500 pounds a year, and had a position of influence at Court. Following an outbreak of anti-Catholic sentiment, he left England and resumed his position as prior at Bornem. In 1672 he was nominated as Vicar Apostolic of England with a see in partibus, but the appointment, owing to the opposition of the \\"English Chapter\\" to his being a vicar Apostolic, and the insistence that he should be a bishop with ordinary jurisdiction, was not confirmed. He was made cardinal in 1675, by Pope Clement X, being assigned the title of Santa Cecilia in Trastevere, exchanged later for the Dominican church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva. He now took up his residence at Rome, especially watching over the interests of the Catholic faith in England. He was to have been Bishop of Helenopolis. In 1679 he was made Protector of England and Scotland. At his insistence the Feast of St. Edward the Confessor was extended to the whole Church. He rebuilt the English College in Rome, and revised the rules of Douai College. Howard cooperated later with James II in the increase of Vicars Apostolic in England from one to four, one of whom was his former secretary, John Leyburn. This arrangement lasted until 1840, when Pope Gregory XVI increased the number to eight. Gilbert Burnet wrote in his History that Cardinal Howard regretted the steps which led to the crisis in the reign of James II and which Howard sought to avert. The cardinal's plans were thwarted and the mission of Roger Palmer, Earl of Castlemaine to Rome showed the rise of another spirit that he did not share. When the crisis he foresaw came, he had the consolation at least of knowing that his foundation at Bornem was beyond the grasp of the anti-Catholic reaction in England. Cardinal Howard assisted at three conclaves, for the election of Innocent XI in 1676, Alexander VIII in 1689, and Innocent XII in 1691, and held the position of Camerlengo of the College of Cardinals. He died in the twentieth year of his cardinalate, at the age of 64, and was buried in his titular church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva at Rome. A monument of white marble with the arms of the Howards honours his memory.

Ann Tweedy Savage purchased the castle in 1975 and with Slessor Troup, one of the area's top master masons, restored it between 1975 and 1977. The restoration work won the Saltire Award in 1977. Harthill Castle is a pink-washed Z-plan twin-tower building, seven storeys () high, made of solid granite, and set in woodland and farmland in Oyne at the foot of Bennachie. The ground floor is vaulted and has arrow slits and musket holes for windows. The next two storeys are partially vaulted. There are circular staircases in each tower, each rising counter-clockwise. The Great Hall has a fireplace that predates the building and was probably brought to the property by the Leiths from their previous home. In 2001, the owner of Harthill made a steading which is located in the same area. The owner lets the local children go in once a year for a little party for the youth club.

Elements of the story tie in with TenNapel's previous comic book work Gear. Plot The book tells of the adventures of Dr. Michael Ong, a paranormal scientist and former seminarian, who is assigned by the United States government to a head researcher's position at an Area 51-esque laboratory in his hometown of Turlock, California, called Research Technical Institute. In exchange for granting the government the lease to build the facility, the City of Turlock demanded for it to be staffed primarily by locals. Ong's task is to open the hundreds of crates in the facility's warehouse, then to catalog and classify the items in each crate. Many of these artifacts are proven to be highly dangerous and thoroughly insane, as they all cover a wide range from Russian teleportation technology to aliens and mutants, even a were-pig. As such, the town nicknames the facility \\"Creature Tech\\". During what is just another ordinary day at the office, the ghost of the evil Dr. Jameson looses a slug-beast from its stasis capsule. Jameson was killed a century prior, after making a deal with a demon named Hellcat in exchange for the power to bring a \\"giant space eel\\" to Earth. Jameson succeeded a little too thoroughly, and he was crushed when the eel crash-landed into gold-rush-era Turlock. The ghost of Dr. Jameson, generations later, seeks an artifact in one of the crates at Creature Tech, the authentic Shroud of Turin, and released the slug-beast in order to distract the facility staff to abscond with the shroud. During the ensuing battle, Ong is stabbed through the heart by a parasite attached to the slug-beast. The parasite detaches itself from the beast and attaches to Ong's chest, replacing his heart, but creating a permanent symbiosis. Using the Shroud, Jameson resurrects his old body and begins a search for the remains of the space eel that killed him, so that he can resurrect it and use its power to destroy the world. In the meantime, he uses his demonic powers to unleash an army of demon-possessed cats upon Turlock. It's a race against time as Ong, the parasite on his chest, the human residents of Turlock and the monsters of Creature Tech defend their town against the demon onslaught and attempt to stop Jameson from destroying the world. Response Creature Tech has received generally positive reviews.

Hypereutectic pistons are made of an aluminum alloy which has much more silicon present than is soluble in aluminum at the operating temperature. Hypereutectic aluminum has a lower coefficient of thermal expansion, which allows engine designers to specify much tighter tolerances. The most common material used for automotive pistons is aluminum due to its light weight, low cost, and acceptable strength. Although other elements may be present in smaller amounts, the alloying element of concern in aluminum for pistons is silicon. The point at which silicon is fully and exactly soluble in aluminum at operating temperatures is around 12%. Either more or less silicon than this will result in two separate phases in the solidified crystal structure of the metal. This is very common. When significantly more silicon is added to the aluminum than 12%, the properties of the aluminum change in a way that is useful for the purposes of pistons for combustion engines. However, at a blend of 25% silicon, there is a significant reduction of strength in the metal, so hypereutectic pistons commonly use a level of silicon between 16% and 19%. Special moulds, casting, and cooling techniques are required to obtain uniformly dispersed silicon particles throughout the piston material. Hypereutectic pistons are stronger than more common cast aluminum pistons and used in many high performance applications. They are not as strong as forged pistons, but are much lower cost due to being cast. Advantages Most automotive engines use aluminum pistons that move in an iron cylinder. The average temperature of a piston crown in a gasoline engine during normal operation is typically about , and the coolant that runs through the engine block is usually regulated at approximately . Aluminum expands more than iron at this temperature range, so for the piston to fit the cylinder properly when at a normal operating temperature, the piston must have a loose fit when cold. In the 1970s, increasing concern over exhaust pollution caused the U.S. government to form the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which began writing and enforcing rules that required automobile manufacturers to introduce changes that made their engines run cleaner. By the late 1980s, automobile exhaust pollution had been noticeably improved, but more stringent regulations forced car manufacturers to adopt the use of electronically controlled fuel injection and hypereutectic pistons. Regarding pistons, it was discovered that when an engine was cold during start-up, a small amount of fuel became trapped between the piston rings. As the engine warmed up, the piston expanded and expelled this small amount of fuel which added to the amount of unburnt hydrocarbons in the exhaust. By adding silicon to the piston's alloy, the piston expansion was dramatically reduced. This allowed engineers to specify reduced clearance between the piston and the cylinder liner. Silicon itself expands less than aluminum. Another benefit of adding silicon is that the piston becomes harder and is less susceptible to scuffing which can occur when a soft aluminum piston is cold-revved in a relatively dry cylinder on start-up or during abnormally high operating temperatures. The biggest drawback of adding silicon to pistons is that the piston becomes more brittle as the ratio of silicon to aluminum is increased. This makes the piston more susceptible to cracking if the engine experiences pre-ignition or detonation. Performance replacement alloys When auto enthusiasts want to increase the power of the engine, they may add some type of forced induction. By compressing more air and fuel into each intake cycle, the power of the engine can be dramatically increased. This also increases the heat and pressure in the cylinder. The normal temperature of gasoline engine exhaust is approximately . This is also approximately the melting point of most aluminum alloys and it is only the constant influx of ambient air that prevents the piston from deforming and failing. Forced induction increases the operating temperatures while \\"under boost\\", and if the excess heat is added faster than the engine can shed it, the elevated cylinder temperatures will cause the air and fuel mix to auto-ignite on the compression stroke before the spark event. This is one type of engine knocking that causes a sudden shockwave and pressure spike, which can result in failure of the piston due to shock-induced surface fatigue, which eats away the surface of the piston. The \\"4032\\" performance piston alloy has a silicon content of approximately 11%. This means that it expands less than a piston with no silicon, but since the silicon is fully alloyed on a molecular level (eutectic), the alloy is less brittle and more flexible than a stock hypereutectic \\"smog\\" (low compression) piston. These pistons can survive mild detonation with less damage than stock pistons. 4032 and hypereutectic alloys have a low coefficient of thermal expansion, allowing tighter piston to cylinder bore fit at assembly temperature. The \\"2618\\" performance piston alloy has less than 2% silicon, and could be described as hypo (under) eutectic. This alloy is capable of experiencing the most detonation and abuse while suffering the least amount of damage. Pistons made of this alloy are also typically made thicker and heavier because of their most common applications in commercial diesel engines. Both because of the higher than normal temperatures that these pistons experience in their usual application, and the higher coefficient of thermal expansion due to low-silicon content causing greater thermal growth, these pistons require a larger piston to cylinder bore clearance at assembly temperatures. This leads to a condition known as \\"piston slap\\" which is when the piston rocks in the cylinder and it causes an audible tapping noise that continues until the engine has warmed to operational temperatures, expanding the piston and reducing piston to cylinder wall clearance. Forged versus cast When a piston is cast, the alloy is heated until liquid, then poured into a mold to create the basic shape. After the alloy cools and solidifies it is removed from the mould and the rough casting is machined to its final shape. For applications which require stronger pistons, a forging process is used. In the forging process, the rough casting is placed in a die set while it is still hot and semi-solid. A hydraulic press is used to place the rough slug under tremendous pressure. This removes any possible porosity, and also pushes the alloy grains together tighter than can be achieved by simple casting alone. The end result is a much stronger material. Aftermarket performance pistons made from the most common 4032 and 2618 alloys are typically forged. Compared to both 4032 and 2618 alloy forged pistons, hypereutectic pistons have less strength. Therefore, for performance applications using boost, nitrous oxide, and/or high RPMs, forged pistons (made from either alloy) are preferred. However, hypereutectic pistons experience less thermal expansion than forged pistons. For this reason, hypereutectic pistons can run a tighter piston to cylinder clearance than forged pistons. This makes hypereutectic pistons a better choice for stock engines, where longevity is more important than ultimate performance. Some vehicles do use forged pistons from the factory. Dodge Vipers used forged pistons from 1992-1999 model years, then switched to hypereutectic. The last generation of Vipers(2013-2017) used forged pistons. All Honda S2000s use forged pistons.

The inquiry was edited in the Monumenta Germaniae Historica (ed. A. Boretius and V. Krause, MGH Capit. 2, no. 253). The document takes its name from Raffelstetten, a toll-bar on the Danube, a few kilometers downstream from Linz (it is now part of the town of Asten in Austria). There, the Carolingian king Louis the Child promulgated a regulation of toll-bars on his domains, after an inquiry dated between 903 and 906. The customs regulations are priceless for documenting trade in Eastern Europe of the 9th and 10th centuries. The document makes it clear that Raffelstetten was a place where German slave traders and their Slavic counterparts exchanged goods.In the vicinity of Raffelstetten, there was a place called Ruzaramarcha (literally, \\"the march of the Ruzari\\", i.e., of the Rus). It is recorded in Louis the German's charter from 16 June 862. The Czech and Rus merchants sold wax, slaves, and horses to German merchants. Salt, weapons, and ornaments were sought by slave trading adventurers. Perhaps the most striking feature of the regulations is the absence of Charlemagne's denarius, the only coin officially recognized in the Frankish Empire. Instead, the document mentions \\"skoti\\", a currency otherwise not attested in Carolingian Europe. It appears that both the name and weight of the \\"skoti\\" were borrowed from the Rus.The East Slavic word \\"skot—ä\\" derives from Old Norse *skattr; the whole monetary system is based on African dirham.

Vasily Vasilievsky notes that the document, being the first legal act to regulate the trade of the Rus', capped off a long tradition of trade between Germany and Kievan Rus.The authors of the regulations proclaim that they did not institute new norms, but restored those regulations that were in force during the reigns of Louis the Pious and Carloman. Alexander Nazarenko suggests that the trade route between Kiev and Regensburg (strata legitima, as it is labeled in the text) was as important in the period as that between Novgorod and Constantinople would be in the tenth century.Nazarenko argues that the Rus' merchants arrived to Austria via the Carpathians and Kiev, rather than via Prague and Krak√≥w, as became usual later.

It is part of the G√∂rlitz district in the State of Saxony. It is located on the Lusatian Neisse, which since 1945 has formed the German-Polish border, directly opposite the town of ≈Åƒôknica (formerly Lugknitz). The municipality contains the western half of the Muskau Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The town is part of the recognized Sorbian settlement area in Saxony. Upper Sorbian has an official status next to German, all villages bear names in both languages.  History  19th century view of the Muskau Park Muskau was founded in the 13th century and was first mentioned in 1249. The state country (Standesherrschaft) of Muskau was the largest of the Holy Roman Empire. From 1319 it was part of the Duchy of Jawor, one of Lower Silesian duchies of fragmented Piast-ruled Poland.Hermann Knothe, Geschichte des Oberlausitzer Adels und seiner G√ºter, Breitkopf & H√§rtel, Leipzig, 1879, p. 567Gustav K√∂hler, Der Bund der Sechsst√§dte in der Ober-Lausitz: Eine Jubelschrift, G. Heinze & Comp., G√∂rlitz, 1846, p. 11 In 1329 it passed to the Bohemian (Czech) Kingdom, where it formed part of the Margraviate of Upper Lusatia, a Bohemian (Czech) Crown Land. In 1452 it was granted town rights. By the 1635 Peace of Prague it passed to the Electorate of Saxony, elevated to the Kingdom of Saxony in 1806. Between 1697 and 1763 it was also under rule of Polish kings in personal union and one of two main routes connecting Warsaw and Dresden ran through the town at that time. Kings Augustus II the Strong and Augustus III of Poland often traveled that route. Part of Upper Lusatia was annexed by Prussia following the 1815 Congress of Vienna and was administered as part of the Province of Silesia. Up to the beginning of the 19th century Muskau's direct rulers were the Counts of Callenberg, succeeded up to 1845 by Count (later Prince) Hermann von P√ºckler- Muskau, later on by Prince Wilhelm Friedrich Karl von Oranien-Nassau, and after him by the Counts von Arnim, right up to their flight in April 1945. After World War II it was divided along the Neisse River between East Germany and Poland. About two thirds of the park came under Polish administration. In 1962 Muskau was renamed \\"Bad Muskau\\" after a therapeutic bath (spa) was built there. In 1972 the border crossing between East Germany and Poland was opened and visa-free local border traffic was allowed.

The company produced a range of Ford- based models from 2002 to 2014 under the FPV marque name. History The roots of FPV can be traced back to 1991, when the English automotive engineering company Tickford began a collaboration with Ford Australia to produce high-performance variants of the Australian Falcon range. The partnership, Tickford Vehicle Engineering, saw the introduction of the Ford Falcon S-XR6 and Ford Falcon S-XR8 models. This was followed in October 1999 by the launch of the Ford Tickford Experience dealer network and the FTE T-Series range based on Ford's AU Falcon and Fairlane models. In 2002, following the purchase of Tickford by Prodrive, the Ford Performance Vehicles company was formed as a joint venture between Ford Australia and Prodrive. The FPV brand name was created to replace the FTE name and a restructured range was developed based on the Ford BA Falcon, seeing the return of the GT nameplate to a Falcon-based product for the first time since the \\"30th Anniversary GT\\", and as a regular production model since the XB Falcon GT. The range was headlined by the FPV GT-P, and included a turbo-charged model based on the XR6 Turbo. Over the years, FPV expanded the range to include a High Performance version of the Ford Territory as well as a number of special editions and anniversary models. The purchase from Prodrive also saw a factory backed V8 Supercar outfit in Ford Performance Racing. In August 2012, Ford Australia announced its purchase of FPV assets to continue the engineering, manufacturing and marketing of that performance brand in Australia.2012 Ford assumes sole responsibility for Ford Performance Vehicles, Thursday, 30 August, fpv.com.au via www.webcitation.org Retrieved on 4 August 2013 In preparation for Ford Australia's manufacturing shutdown, the FPV brand and its range were discontinued in 2014, after 12 years of production and marketing. =Nameplates= FPV used a number of nameplates for its vehicles. The following are the main series of models offered during the company's run. ;F6-E Replaced the Force 6 as the luxury orientated 6-cyl offering. ;F6 Typhoon/Tornado Introduced in 2004 with the BA MkII, used an improved version of the \\"Barra\\" 4.0L turbo. Prior to the release of the FG series F6 in 2008, the sedan and utility models were marketed as the F6 Typhoon and F6 Tornado respectively. ;F6-X SUV product based on the Ford Territory. ;Force 6 Luxury orientated offering, using the Typhoon engine, but with low-key looks. ;Force 8 Luxury orientated offering, using the GT drive-train, but with low-key looks. Positioned above the GT-P as the flagship model until the GT-E. ;GS Intended to sit below the GT and provide a lower entry-point to the FPV range. ;GT Served as the Falcon-based entry level product until the arrival of the GS in 2010. ;GT-E Replacing the Force 8 as the top-of-the-line FPV offering. ;GT-P Higher specification of the GT, with most options standard. Model Series (Ford Falcon-based) BA The 2002 BA range included the GT, GT-P, and the Pursuit. The GT was the entry-level vehicle that started with a suggested retail price of A$59,810. The GT-P was the upmarket version of the GT, with a price tag of A$69,850. The Pursuit was a ute (utility) version of the GT, featuring the same seats, basic dash/interior package and wheels. A FPV specific body-kit was applied to all cars, using the lights from the XR-range. The kit had a strong resemblance to the BA Falcon V8 Supercar, highlighting the connection to FPR. All three were powered by a unique version of Ford's 5.4-litre Modular V8, with DOHC 4-valve cylinder heads from the Mustang Cobra R engine. FPV named this uniquely tuned engine as the Boss 290 because of its power output. It produced at 5,500 rpm and of torque at 4,500 rpm. Featured Models *GT *GT-P *Pursuit (ute) =MkII update= The GT, GT-P and Pursuit received a new stripe package with bonnet decals, a six-speed Tremec T56 manual and the GT-P received 19\\" five-spoke alloy wheels. FPV also released the Super Pursuit, which was a Pursuit ute with GT-P extras. New six cylinder sedan and utility models were added to the range, the F6 Typhoon (sedan) and F6 Tornado (ute). The F6 was visually separated from the GT range with the use of a different pattern in the front bumper grill mesh, and a smaller boot spoiler on the sedan. F6 models were powered by FPV's version of the Ford Barra engine, a 4.0 litre DOHC 24-valve turbocharged inline-six with variable cam timing producing at 5,250 rpm and at 2,000 - 4,250 rpm.

All models shared the same six-speed manual and were now offered with an optional German made ZF six-speed automatic (the same as featured in Jaguars and BMWs). The GT received the GT-P's old 19-inch wheels, and the GT-P and Super Pursuit received their own specific road wheel styles. Typhoon & Tornado versions had optional 18-inch road wheel design used on the previous model, or a new 19-inch design with black spokes. All models also received new body kits, with the F6 Typhoon benefiting from its own unique styling changes. The F6 now had color coded fog lamp surrounds, and a lower grill insert emphasizing the intercooler. The rear now had a new bumper with mesh inserts, a deeper diffuser, with the GT models now sporting a dual exit exhaust system cut into the diffuser.

Built to rival HSV's Senator Signature, they are mechanically identical to the auto- equipped GT model, but in a more luxury-focused package with more conservative visuals (no rear wing and more conservative colour range). The Force models are essentially an FPV version of the Fairmont Ghia (luxury model in the Falcon range).

Its nomenclature was chosen to mean \\"F\\" for final whereas \\"351\\" is this GT-F's engine output in kW as well as a homage to the iconic engine capacity of the 1970s GT Falcon (XW to XB series). Mechanically, the GT-F features launch control, standard Brembo six-piston front and four- piston rear brakes, the suspension and 275/35 R19 Dunlop Sports Maxx 9in rear tyre package from the limited edition GT R-spec and a retuned version of the supercharged Coyote \\"Miami\\" 5.0 L V8 engine (embossed \\"GT-F 351\\" instead of \\"Boss 335\\") developing a minimum of at 6,000 rpm of power (or, depending on prevailing conditions, over for 15‚Äì20 seconds thanks to a transient overboost function) but an unchanged at 2,500-5,500 rpm of torque that is, however, available across a broader range. Inside, the GT-F is characterised by darker finishes, orange accents throughout (e.g. trim stitching, instrument facia and GT-F seat embroiding) and a build number plate complemented by a certificate. The exterior features stealth or black accents (specifically, the headlight and foglight bezels are black, as are the external mirrors, door handles, rear spoiler and diffuser, alloy wheels) and a unique GT-F stripe package (including over the roof of the car) that is available in different colours depending on exterior paints, which are Winter White, Silhouette (black), Kinetic (blue), Octane (orange) and Smoke (grey). The NSW highway patrol acquired one of these last ever FPV GT sedans (build number 88 out of 500 allocated to the domestic market) which, as a unique special, had the engine tuned by Ford racing legend Dick Johnson to . This gave it far more power than Australian racing V8 Supercars and it is, as of 2015, Australia's most powerful police vehicle. It was commissioned by the NSW police force as a promotional car, although it is a fully equipped and operational highway patrol police vehicle. FPV auctioned build number 001 and the last (for Australia) build number 500 on eBay, with a view to donate proceedings to the National Breast Cancer Foundation. These cars were sold for $236,100 and $157,600 and attracted 84 and 106 bids, respectively.

The F6X is fitted with the F6 270 Turbo 4.0 L DOHC in-line six-cylinder engine, a ZF six-speed automatic transmission and a full-time all-wheel-drive system. It is the first non Falcon-based model to be produced by FPV and, with an engine producing and , was claimed by the company to be the most powerful six-cylinder SUV available in Australia at that time. The F6X was discontinued in February 2009, with 251 examples having been built. Concept Cars ;Galaxie 540 During a 2004 FPV open day, FPV had a clay model of a Fairlane on display. It Featured a custom front end with GT headlamps and bonnet, and a custom bodykit.http://www.falcongtclub.org/EventList.asp?StartDate=29+February+2004&EndDate;=29+February+2004 ;Territory P-SUV For a 2007 open day, FPV had a Territory-based concept on display. The P-SUV had an open rear section behind the rear seats. The floor of the open rear section and its extension was covered in machine finish metal sheets with the same material covering the fold-down rear seat backs.http://www.carpoint.com.au/news/2007/fpv/fpv-territory-makes-open- day-2942 ;GT \\"Black Edition\\" concept For the 2011 Melbourne motor show, FPV displayed the \\"FLPV concept\\" (commonly known as the \\"Black Edition\\"), based on the just released supercharged GT series. It featured an all-black appearance, and a unique front bumper and staggered wheel design at the time considered to be available on future FPV products. However, these failed to make an appearance, with only the use of wider rear wheels making the R-spec and GT-F limited editions. Engines =5.4L Modular \\"Boss\\" V8= ;Boss 290 Based on the cast iron 4V DOHC Boss short blocks sourced from Windsor, Ontario, the Boss engines include some locally sourced parts such as intake and pistons coupled with DOHC 4-valve cylinder heads from the Mustang Cobra R engine. FPV named this uniquely tuned engine as the Boss 290 because of its power output. It produced 290 kW (394 PS; 389 bhp) at 5,500 rpm and 520 N¬∑m (380 lb¬∑ft) of torque at 4,500 rpm. ;Boss 302 For the BFII FPV GT Cobra special edition, the Boss 302 was created. The GT Cobra motor produced 405 hp (302 kW) and 398 lb¬∑ft (540 N¬∑m)). The Boss 302 motor was also added to all V8-powered FPV models until the release of the FG in 2008. ;Boss 315 For the FG MkI, the 5.4 was further tuned to produce 315 kW (428 PS; 422 bhp) and 551 N¬∑m (406 lb¬∑ft). FPV achieved this through a new camshaft profile, new camshaft timing, strengthened piston assembly and a higher compression ratio (10.5:1 to 10.8:1). =5.0L Coyote \\"Miami\\" V8= In October 2010 FPV retired the 5.4L Boss V8, in favour of a new supercharged 5.0L V8. The project, codenamed \\"Miami\\", is based on the Coyote 5.0 litre V8 and is a supercharged alloy quad cam engine. It has cost FPV $40 million and has taken 3 years to develop. The engine was offered in three versions, Boss 315, 335 and finally 351. With the closure of FPV, the Boss 335 engine was used in the returning XR8 model with the FG-X range. Another variation was developed for the special edition XR8 sprint, that developed . ;Boss 315 Used in the entry level GS sedan and ute, the Boss 315 produces 315 kW (428 PS; 422 bhp) at 5,750 rpm and 545 N¬∑m (402 lb¬∑ft) between 2,000 - 5,500 rpm. ;Boss 335 Available in the GT range, the Boss 335 kW (455 PS; 449 bhp) between 5,750 - 6,000 rpm and between 2,200 - 5,500 rpm. The latter is offered in the GT range, which includes GT, GT-P, and GT-E. Fuel economy was improved dropping 4.5% to 13.7 L/100 km for the auto and 13.6 L/100 km for the manual. Boss 345 Exclusive to the FG X XR8 Sprint, the Boss 345 developed 345 kW of power and 575 Nm of torque, with base torque figures being just 1 Nm shy of the XR6 Sprint. In favourable atmospheric conditions, overboost mode raised the output to 400 kW / 650 Nm, being equal with the figures produced by the FPV GT-F. The Boss 345 had the build number inscribed onto the top of the engine, instead of any reference to power figures as with previous iterations. ;Boss 351 This is a specially tuned variant of the 5.0L unique to the GT-F, similar to the Cobra before it, the 351 is a reference to the Cleveland engines offered in the Falcon in the past. =4.0L \\"Barra\\" I6= ;Barra 270 For the BA/BF F6 Typhoon and Tornado models, the boost from the Garrett GT3540 turbocharger was increased over the Barra 240, producing at 5,250 rpm and of torque at 2,000-4,000 rpm ;Barra 310 With the FG series, the Garret GT3540 was retained as opposed to the smaller GT3576 used in the FG XR6 Turbo. This is the most powerful engine with at 5,250 rpm and of torque at 1,950-5,200 rpm (and the first to produce more than 100 hp (75 kW) per litre) manufactured in Australia. As a result, ;Barra 325 Exclusively fitted to the FGX XR6 Turbo Sprint. It was essentially a Barra 270T with a Garrett GT3540 and revised carbon fibre intake.

Given the team's massive budget, its early results were disappointing but a form reversal in 2006 saw the team finish second in the Teams' standings. Mark Winterbottom also placed second in the Drivers Championship in 2008. In January 2013 the team was sold by Prodrive to Rusty French and Rod Nash.V8 team FPR sold to Melbourne-based pair Sydney Morning Herald 5 January 2013 The team achieved their first Bathurst 1000 victory in 2013 with Mark Winterbottom and Steven Richards driving a Falcon FG. In 2015, Ford Performance Racing was renamed as Prodrive Racing Australia as a result of Ford's decision to progressively withdraw its V8 Supercars support by 2016. FPR drivers have included Craig Lowndes, Glenn Seton, Greg Ritter, David Brabham, David Besnard, Jason Bright, Mark Winterbottom, Steven Richards and Will Davison. =Drifting= FPV created a show car dubbed the 'DRIF6' - an F6 Typhoon with modifications making the car suitable for competitive drifting. The car was entered into the national-level Drift Australia Series in 2006, where it was driven by Adam 'Newtonmeter' Newton. One of the car's main objectives was to expose the FPV brand to a younger audience than its usual, traditional V8-driving crowd. Apart from Adam Newton, only Gary Myers of Summernats Burnout fame has driven the car. Gary drove the F6 for Street Machine Magazine, and commented the vehicle had incredible power. The F6 drift car managed to score a best qualifying position of 5th at Mallala Motorsport Park in Adelaide, South Australia. In the Queensland Round of racing, the car suffered damage when Warren Luff, a professional race driver, took to the wheel for a few demo laps. Under Warren's control the car only made the end of the back straight of Queensland Raceway before it was turned passenger side first into the wall and Warren ended up in hospital with a fractured nose. The damaged vehicle made an appearance in China to bolster one of its sponsors agendas. Ford Australia brought the vehicle back to Australia and it can be seen at the Ford Australia Discovery Centre in Geelong Victoria.

The river flows into the Luga Bay of the Gulf of Finland. It freezes up in the early December and stays under the ice until early April. The length of the Luga is , and the area of its drainage basin is . Its main tributary is the Oredezh (right). The towns of Luga and Kingisepp, as well as the urban-type settlement of Tolmachyovo are located on the banks of the Luga. The mouth of the Luga is the site of the Ust-Luga container terminal. The source of the Luga is located in a peat production area in the northwest of Novgorod Oblast, several dozen kilometers northwest of the city of Veliky Novgorod. The river flows south, crosses into Batetsky District, and gradually turns west. A stretch of the Luga serves the border between Novgorod and Leningrad Oblasts. There, the Luga flows northwest, in the town of Luga turns north, accepts the Oredezh from the right, and flows through the urban- type settlement of Tolmachyovo. There, it turns northwest and reaches the border of Luzhsky District. A stretch of the Luga forms the borders between Gatchinsky and Volosovsky, Slantsevsky and Volosovsky, and Kingiseppsky and Volosovsky Districts. In the town of Kingisepp the Luga turns north and subsequently northeast. The mouth of the Luga River is located in the settlement of Ust-Luga. The drainage basin of the Luga includes large areas in the north of Novgorod Oblast (Novgorodsky and Batetsky Districts), as well as in the southwest of Leningrad Oblast (Gatchinsky, Luzhsky, Volosovsky, Slantsevsky, and Kingiseppsky Districts).

He was one of the world's leading experts on Tanakh (Hebrew Bible), and especially of the text of the Aleppo Codex. His first cousin was the historian also named Mordechai Breuer. Breuer was a great- grandson of Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch. Biography Mordechai Breuer was born in 1921 to Samson and Else Leah Breuer. His paternal grandfather was Rabbi Dr. Salomon Breuer, son-in-law of Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch. His mother died while Mordechai was a young child, and his father then married Agatha Jeidel. At age twelve, he and his family emigrated to then-British Palestine. There, he studied at Yeshivat Hebron and Yeshivat Kol Torah. He taught Tanakh in several yeshivot and schools in Israel beginning in 1947. In 1999 he was awarded the Israel Prize for original Rabbinical Literature. He also received an honorary doctorate by the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Literary contribution Breuer's position was that only a single correct text of Tanakh existed; any variants from this authoritative edition were therefore errors. Breuer's approach to establishing this correct text and punctuation of Tanakh was at first eclectic, based on several early manuscripts (and the Venice edition of Mikra'ot Gedolot) and their masoretic notes, as well as notes from Wolf Heidenheim and Min·∏•at Shai (Rabbi Solomon Norzi). He later gained access to the Aleppo Codex (dating from the tenth century) and found it to match almost perfectly with his work, supporting his thesis of only one correct edition. His edition was first published by Mossad Harav Kook in the Da'at Mikra series and as its own volume. It was republished in 1998 and 2001 by different publishers. The last is the modern edition of the Tanakh known as Keter Yerushalayim (), referred to in English as the Jerusalem Codex. It is based graphically on the Aleppo Codex, and is now the official Tanakh of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and of the Israeli Knesset. He was known for developing Shitat Habechinot (\\"the aspect approach\\") which suggests that differing styles and internal tensions in the Biblical text represent different \\"voices\\" of God or Torah, which cannot be merged without losing their identity. According to Breuer, God wrote the Torah from \\"multiple perspectives ‚Ä¶ each one constituting truth, [for] it is only the combination of such truths that gives expression to the absolute truth.\\" If applied, this approach would provide an alternative framework to the documentary hypothesis, which maintains that the Torah was written by multiple authors. In his two volume book Pirkei Moadot (1986), Rabbi Breuer discusses twenty eight topics, mostly holidays like Shabbat, Pesach, Shavuot, and Hanukkah. The majority of the essays address the peshat or simple understanding of the Biblical text (written law) and attempt to clarify how it corresponds with the halakha or rabbinic law. A few of the essays address issues of oral law. For example, in one of his essays on Pesach, he discusses why and how the order of the Pesach Seder has changed since the destruction of the Temple. Originally, the korban Pesach was eaten after saying kiddush and drinking the first cup of wine. He explains how and why the Seder developed as presented in the Haggadah nowadays. In the introduction, he articulates his methodology for ascertaining the peshat of the Biblical text and demonstrates this method in several of the essays.Breuer, Mordechai, Pirkei Moadot, Horev Publications, Jerusalem 1993. He authored five other works: One on the Aleppo Codex, one on Taamei Hamikra, Pirkei Bereishit, Pirkei Mikraot, and Pirkei Yeshayahu. Breuer also translated Samson Raphael Hirsch's Commentary on the Pentateuch that was written in German into Hebrew together with his cousin Mordechai Breuer.

A partwork is a written publication released as a series of planned magazine-like issues over a period of time. Issues are typically released on a weekly, fortnightly or monthly basis, and often a completed set is designed to form a reference work on a particular topic. Publication Models of an Opel Admiral and a 1958-59 Opel Kapit√§n cars in 1:43 scale by Altaya; issued as part of The Opal Collection partwork published by Eaglemoss Partwork series run for a determined length and have a finite life. Generally, partworks cover specific areas of interest, such as sports, hobbies, or children's interest and stories such as PC Ace and the successful The Ancestral Trail series by Marshall Cavendish Ltd. They are generally sold at newsagents and are mostly supported by massive television advertising campaigns for the launch. In the United Kingdom, partworks are usually launched by heavy television advertising each January. Partworks often include cover-mounted items with each issue that build into a complete set over time. For example, a partwork about art might include a small number of paints or pencils that build into a complete art-set; a partwork about dinosaurs might include a few replica bones that build a complete model skeleton at the end of the series; a partwork about films may include a DVD with each issue. In Europe, partworks with collectable models are extremely popular; there are a number of different publications that come with character figurines or diecast model vehicles, for example: The James Bond Car Collection. In addition, completed partworks have sometimes been used to create case-bound reference works and encyclopedias. An example is the multi- volume Illustrated Science and Invention Encyclopedia which was created with material first published in the How It Works partwork. According to the Periodical Publishers Association in 2003, partworks were the fourth-best selling magazine sector in the UK, after TV listing guides, women's weeklies and women's monthlies. A common inducement is a heavy discount for the first one or two issues. The same series can be sold worldwide in different languages and even in different variations.  History  Prior to the invention of printing, the Pecia System was used in European university cities. Books were divided into sections known as Pecia. Students or other individuals could rent the individual pieces and copy them by hand. In this way, several individuals could work on copying one book at the same time. With the advent of printing, serialized publication came into use by printers and publishers. Between 1728 and 1732, Nicolas Tindal's English translation of Paul de Rapin's L'Histoire d'Angleterre (The History of England) was issued by a London printer in monthly parts. A rival printer then tried to compete by selling another translation of de Rapin's work in weekly, six-penny installments. An edition of Foxe's Book of Martyrs was issued in three-penny installments in 1732. At the time, printing a book was a lengthy process, copies of each section of the book being printed in turn until the work was complete; the sections would then be collated and the print-run of books could then be sold. The alternative of selling individual sections as soon as they were printed would enable the printer could gain a steady income while the book was being produced, and potentially increase sales by selling to people who could not afford the upfront cost of a copy of the complete book. In the 19th century, many of Charles Dickens' novels were first published as partworks. For example, The Pickwick Papers was first published in 19 parts, between 1836 and 1837. The Old Curiosity Shop was first published in 88 weekly parts between April 1840 and November 1841. In the mid-20th century, partwork serialized encyclopedias were issued. Publishers soon branching out to topics, including cookery books and series on gardening and car maintenance.  Criticisms  Partworks, particularly those that contain parts for the production of a model or similar collectable items that are individually of little value, often draw criticism for the extremely high prices of their finished product. One example, released in the UK in 2009, required the purchase of 125 issues to collect the parts for a static, model aircraft; the total would be ¬£620.25. Examples of other models that cost over ¬£400 to produce are cited, and some subscribers complain they have parts missing that they are unable to replace.

He rose rapidly in the civil service, becoming Assistant Surveyor-General by 1856 and the Surveyor General of South Australia in 1861. He is remembered today for Goyder's Line of rainfall, a line used in South Australia to demarcate land climatically suitable for arable farming from that suitable only for light grazing, and for the siting, planning and initial development of Darwin, the Northern Territory capital and principal population centre. However, Goyder was an avid researcher into the lands of South Australia (including the present-day Northern Territory) and made recommendations to a great number of settlers in the newly developing colony, especially to those exploiting the newly discovered mineral resources of the state.  Career  = Early life = Goyder was born in Liverpool, England to Sarah and David George Goyder, the latter a Swedenborgian minister and physician. He moved to Glasgow with his family where he worked with an engineering firm and studied surveying. In 1848, at the age of 22, Goyder followed his sister and brother-in-law, George Galbraith MacLachlan (c. 1842 ‚Äì 19 March 1873), to Sydney. He spent time working with an auctioneering firm and moved to Adelaide in 1851, obtaining work as a civil service draftsman. = Assistant to Surveyor-General = Goyder was appointed Assistant Surveyor- General circa 1856. In this period he made many expeditions into the outback regions of South Australia, thinking that the water in lakes he saw at the time was fresh and permanent, rather than exceedingly erratic. He wrote many letters to newly established pastoralists who had moved into the arid regions for the state's north, and also surveyed the newly establishing mining industry in the Flinders Ranges. In 1861 he was appointed Surveyor-General. His early years in the role were very difficult, especially his efforts to help establish settlement in the Northern Territory by supervising the establishment of the pastoral leaseholds that continue to the present day. Pastoralists were hit by a major drought in the middle of the decade and complained severely, with many forced to move even relatives away from their cattle stations by the end of 1865. Goyder was also faced with the despair of his wife, Frances Mary Smith, who suffered the loss of twins at birth during George's long travels in the outback. Goyder resigned his position as Surveyor-General in 1894, completing a public service career that spanned 41 years. =Goyder's Line of rainfall= Satellite image of vegetation and desert in South Australia. Goyder provided advice as to the geographic limits of crop growing in South Australia. Before the drought of the mid-1860s, wheat and barley growing had been spreading rapidly further north and the erroneous belief that rain would \\"follow the plow\\" led to the idea of cereal crops spreading up to the Northern Territory border. However, the 1864-65 drought put paid, at least temporarily, to these ambitions. Goyder was, in the midst of his work in the pastoral zone, asked to do a report on the problem and his response was to find out how far south crop failure had been general. The northernmost point at which crops had not failed was marked as \\"Goyder's Line of Rainfall\\" and corresponds approximately to the 300-millimetre (12-inch) annual isohyet (figures vary from 250 to 350 millimetres in different publications). Goyder recommended that farmers not attempt to farm cereal crops anywhere north of this line. The idea was quite contrary to beliefs widespread at the time and seen as ridiculous by many people in high places, yet it has been proven to be very wise by the many major droughts in the 140 years since, which have led to major losses by all graingrowers near to, or north of, the line. Goyder's Line was first accepted significantly after a number of dry years in 1881-1882 and 1884-1886, though improved cultivation practices have allowed some expansion in the 1980s and 1990s, despite a couple of very severe droughts. =Survey of Palmerston= Goyder was sent by the government of South Australia, (of which the Territory was then a part) to lay out the street plans for a capital to be named Palmerston. The site was chosen for its exceptionally good water supply, and potential for easy communication with the rest of the continent through land or sea transportation. The site was chosen after Finniss's choice at Escape Cliffs had been rejected. With the incentive of a ¬£3,000 bonus, \\"Little Energy\\" as he was praisingly nicknamed and his team of around 128 men left Port Adelaide on the Moonta 27 December 1868 and dropped anchor in Darwin Harbour on 5 February 1869. He selected the site on Fort Point near Port Darwin, and nearby townships to be named Daly, Southport and Virginia. They began the work in 1869, completing all four in 18 months. Goyder returned on the Gulnare to Adelaide in November 1869 with around thirty men, the greater part of his party returning in October 1870, though many (Dr. Robert Peel, George MacLachlan, John Packard, Alfred and Frederick Schultze included) remained to fill positions in the town. Others, including Dan Daly and Paul Foelsche, were to return within a few years.Goyder Kerr, Margaret The Surveyors Rigby, Adelaide 1971 (Mrs Kerr was a grand- daughter of George Woodroffe Goyder). Among the 100-odd members of Goyder's expedition were: G. S. Aldridge, J. H. Aldridge, George A. Armstrong, Job Austin, W. Barlow, R. W. Barrow, Tom Bee, David L. Beetson, J. W. O.

Woods, Ned & John Ryan (SA Govt Surveyors), most of whom are commemorated in the names of Darwin streets and outlying localities. The Overland Telegraph was landed there from England (via present-day Indonesia) soon afterwards, and commenced operation in 1872. In 1911 Palmerston was renamed Darwin, but the name Palmerston was resurrected around 1980 for Darwin's satellite city to the south.  Personal life  He married Frances Mary Smith on 10 December 1851 at Christ Church, North Adelaide, and had nine children with her. Frances died on 8 April 1870 and George married her sister Ellen Priscilla Smith, who had been looking after the children, on 20 November 1871. With Ellen, George had three children, a son and twin daughters. Goyder led an austere and disciplined life, and this was reflected in his strict treatment of subordinates - though he was always regarded as fair to those he advised in spite of many complaints by farmers and graziers. By the late 1880s, however, Goyder's health was declining and, with no improvement in sight, he resigned the post of Surveyor-General at the end of 1893. He died at his home \\"Warrakilla\\", at Mylor near Aldgate in the Adelaide Hills on 2 November 1898 and was buried in the Stirling District Cemetery. Legacy Goyder Road in Darwin is named for him, and many others of the party are similarly honoured. Also named for him are a large river in Arnhem Land and electorates in both the Northern Territory and South Australia. Mount Woodroffe, the highest peak in South Australia at is named after him (George Woodroffe Goyder) Goyder's name has also been given to a species of grasswren Amytornis goyderi (Gould 1875), a district council, an electorate, the new pavilion at the Royal Adelaide Showgrounds, several streets, a park and the Goyder Institute for Water Research. =Named by Goyder= * Fannie Bay, Northern Territory http://www.ntlis.nt.gov.au/placenames/view.jsp?id=2035 * Frances Bay, Northern Territory http://www.jaunay.com/goyder.html =Named after Goyder= * Regional Council of Goyder * Electoral district of Goyder, South Australia * Electoral division of Goyder, Northern Territory * Goyder Lagoon * Goyder Channel * Goyder crater * Goyder Highway (State B64), South Australia * Goyder River East Arnhemland, Northern Territory * Goyder, South Australia, a locality * Woodroffe, a suburb of Palmerston * Mount Woodroffe, South Australia's highest peak and of course Goyder's Line of rainfall See also * Agriculture in Australia * Moonta Herald References External links *Australian Dictionary of Biography *George W.

It was developed over five years by Japanese developer Daisuke \\"Pixel\\" Amaya in his free time. Cave Story features 2D platform mechanics and is reminiscent of the games Amaya played in his youth, such as Metroid and Castlevania (both released in 1986). After its initial self-published release, the game slowly gained popularity on the internet. It received widespread critical acclaim for many polished aspects of its design, such as its compelling characters, setting, story, and gameplay. Cave Story is considered by many as the quintessential indie game because of its one-man development team and influence on the gaming world.http://game-wisdom.com/series/evolving-game- industry-indies Independent developer Nicalis worked with Amaya to port the game to WiiWare and DSiWare in 2010. An enhanced version, Cave Story+, was released for Steam in November 2011, and the original game was released for the Nintendo 3DS in October 2012 with added content. A 3D remake of the game, titled Cave Story 3D, was developed by Nicalis and published by NIS America for the Nintendo 3DS in November 2011. A port of Cave Story+ for the Nintendo Switch was released in June 2017. The fast-paced gameplay of Cave Story revolves around Quote, a robot who wakes up suffering amnesia and who must explore and blast his way through cavernous areas in order to figure out his backstory and escape from the cave. The character gains access to new areas as he powers up his weapons by collecting triangular experience crystals and solves various platforming puzzles. Quote speaks to non-player characters scattered around the game world in order to learn more about the world and its inhabitants. Gameplay heads-up display in the top left displays an equipped weapon, weapon level, and current health. The yellow triangles represent experience points to be picked up. The player controls the on- screen character directly using the keyboard or gamepad. The player progresses by navigating platform game puzzles and shooting enemies with the equipped weapon. When the player collects multiple weapons, they may be toggled at any time with the press of a button. Defeating enemies sometimes yield yellow triangular objects, which give experience points to weapons when collected. Weapons may be improved up to level three, but taking damage causes weapons to lose experience and levels. Health and missile capacity upgrades are scattered throughout the game world. The player must interact with a variety of non- player characters and objects to complete the game. Plot =Setting= Cave Story takes place within the cavernous interior of a floating island. The island is populated by Mimiga, a race of sentient, rabbit-like creatures. A particular species of red flower that grows in the island causes the normally peaceful Mimiga to fall into a violent frenzy when ingested. The island also conceals an artifact called the Demon Crown, which has vast magical powers. An army of robot soldiers was sent to the floating island on a military expedition, seeking to harness the Demon Crown as a weapon for wars on the surface. These robots slaughtered the Mimiga indiscriminately in their search for the crown, but were defeated when the Mimiga decided to eat the red flowers as a last resort. Shortly before the game begins, Professor Booster, the Sakamoto family, and various assistants formed a scientific party to research the island, but they became stranded when their medical doctor managed to acquire the Crown; he then forced the expedition to search for the red flowers. =Story= The player character awakens in a cave with no memory of how he came to be there. He finds a village of Mimiga, who are being persecuted by the Doctor. The Doctor's servants Misery and Balrog are looking for Sue Sakamoto, a girl who had been transformed into a Mimiga. Not finding her, they mistakenly abduct another Mimiga named Toroko instead. The player finds Sue in the Egg Corridor, where she discovers the egg of a Sky Dragon, which could allow her to escape the floating island if hatched. Sue attempts to rescue her brother Kazuma, but King, the leader of Mimiga Village, captures her and holds her responsible for Toroko's kidnapping. Sue tasks the player with retrieving Kazuma from Grasstown. After freeing him, they meet Professor Booster, who reveals that the Doctor plans to use the red flowers on Mimigas to create an army to take over the surface world. Booster sends the player to the Sand Zone to destroy the red flowers before the Doctor can find them. While there, the player meets Curly Brace, a female robot who also has no memories of her past, and Jenka, an old witch who is Misery's mother and guardian of the red flowers. Jenka calls the player character a \\"soldier from the surface\\", one of many who were sent to the island to slaughter the Mimiga. Balrog manages to steal the key to the warehouse containing the red flowers from Jenka, who urges the player to stop them. Before the player can reach the warehouse, however, the Doctor force-feeds the captured Toroko a red flower and fatally injures King, leaving the player to fight the rabid Toroko, who ultimately dies. Misery banishes the player to the Labyrinth deep inside the island as punishment for interfering with the Doctor's plans. Curly Brace has also been thrown into the Labyrinth and the two cooperate to escape. Balrog helps them to move the boulder blocking the exit, revealing his kind nature. The pair find and defeat the Core, a magical creature whose power keeps the island afloat. However, the Doctor steps in to save it before the island collapses. Depending on certain conditions, the player may rescue Curly Brace, who had sacrificed her air tank to save the player character. When he returns to Mimiga Village, he finds that the Doctor has captured the Mimiga. In the Egg Corridor, Kazuma offers the player a choice to escape the island with him using a Sky Dragon, leading to an alternate ending in which the Doctor conquers the surface world while Kazuma and the player hide in the mountains. The player may instead choose to confront the Doctor and destroy the island's Core, which would return the Mimiga to normal. The player scales the outer wall of the island to reach the Plantation where the Doctor is using the Mimigas as slave laborers to grow red flowers. The Doctor's servants capture the player and place him in a jail cell with Sue. She is taken away before the player wakes up, but her letter reveals that the Doctor was a member of the research expedition that included Sue's family and Professor Booster, but he betrayed them once he found the Demon Crown. Sue directs the player to find her mother who may have a plan to stop the Doctor. If the player saved Curly Brace earlier, the player may find an item to restore her memories. She remembers that the player character's name is Quote, and that they were not the killer robots who slaughtered Mimigas in the past. Instead, they were sent to destroy the Demon Crown to prevent its power from falling into the wrong hands. Quote finds Sue's mother, Momorin, who is building a rocket that will allow access to the top of the island where the Doctor resides. After helping her complete the rocket, Quote confronts Misery and the Doctor. The Doctor has purified the essence of the red flowers into a crystal, which allows him to survive even after Quote kills him. The Doctor's spirit possesses the Core of the island, but Quote succeeds in destroying that as well, causing the island to begin falling to Earth. Should the player have saved Curly, restored her memories and acquired the Booster V2.0 from Professor Booster, they may proceed into the Bloodstained Sanctuary, a bonus stage where Curly can be found and rescued; it is also here that Ballos ‚Äîcreator of the Demon Crown and Jenka's younger brother ‚Äî is imprisoned. A powerful wizard who went insane and destroyed his homeland after being tortured by a jealous king, Ballos was sealed deep within the island by his sister. At some point, his niece Misery forced him to create the Demon Crown, but she and Balrog became cursed to serve whoever possessed it. Additionally, it is stated via narration that the Demon Crown will repair itself if it is destroyed, and will only truly lose its power if Ballos is killed, necessitating that Quote and Curly kill him. With the help of Curly Brace, Quote defeats Ballos and stops the source of the negative energy that was causing the island to fall, saving its inhabitants. Balrog saves the two before they are crushed by Ballos' collapsing prison; he had been sent by Misery as thanks for breaking her curse. Quote, Curly Brace, and Balrog leave the island to live out their days in peace. Development Daisuke \\"Pixel\\" Amaya programmed, illustrated, designed, wrote the story for, and composed the music to Cave Story over the course of five years. Daisuke \\"Pixel\\" Amaya developed Cave Story in his free time over five years. He began the project when he was in college and continued working on it after getting a job as a software developer. He started by writing the title screen music and programming rudimentary character movements. The idea for the cave setting evolved spontaneously when he created a number of enclosed spaces. Amaya admitted this lack of planning caused \\"problems down the line\\" because he did not have dedicated map editing and data management tools. Amaya describes the game as having an \\"old-fashioned feel\\", reminiscent of the games he played as a child, like Metroid. More importantly, this \\"retro\\" design choice allowed him to create a large amount of art on his own, which would have been impossible for a 3D game. At a Game Developers Conference project post-mortem, he emphasized the role of pragmatic design in shaping the game. While designing the main character, \\"Quote\\", Amaya drew inspiration from the plumber Mario's iconic original appearance‚Äîa large, expressive face and a high contrast between his white skin and red shirt make him stand out from the dark cave backgrounds. Most other characters feature either light skin or white clothes for the same reason. To make levels memorable, Amaya designed them around a single theme, such as \\"warmth\\" for the Egg Corridor, and \\"arid and oppressive\\" for the Sand Zone. Instead of a tutorial level, a concept Amaya dislikes, the first level of the game gives the player two paths, one of which is blocked off until retrieving an item from the other path. This setup, inspired by the opening of Metroid, \\"lets players feel like they've solved problems on their own\\" and persists throughout the game. In beta versions of the game, all the enemies were shaped like bars of soap, a concept that evolved into the \\"Balrog\\" character. There was also a \\"frog prince\\" character who could travel through water more easily. Elements of this beta were incorporated into the Nintendo 3DS version of the game. Versions and ports =Ports= Cave Story has been ported to Linux, Haiku OS, AROS, MorphOS, AmigaOS 4 and Mac OS X operating systems, PlayStation Portable, Xbox, Dreamcast, Sega Genesis, GP2X, GP2X Wiz, and the TI graphing calculator. An enhanced port, featuring updated character designs, remixed music and extra game modes, was developed by Nicalis and released on WiiWare on 22 March 2010 in North America and 10 December 2010 in Europe. Nicalis also ported the game to DSiWare on 29 November 2010 in North America and 22 November 2011 in Japan. Although it does not feature the enhanced graphics and sound or some of the extra modes from the Wii version, it does include the Sanctuary Attack mode. There is also a free/libre SDL-based recreation of the original game engine, titled NXEngine, made by programmer Caitlin Shaw, which allows for extended modification of the game, and the creation of ports for additional devices. The game was released for the Nintendo 3DS's Nintendo eShop service (separate from the retail 3DS game) in the United States on 4 October 2012 and in Europe on 1 May 2014. This version includes the DSiWare version's Jukebox mode, as well as all the additional modes included in Cave Story+. =Cave Story+= An enhanced PC version titled Cave Story+ was released by Nicalis on the Steam service on 22 November 2011. Cave Story+ features an alternative script that differs from the original English translation. This version contains all the additional modes from the WiiWare version, a remastered soundtrack, as well as the option to toggle the style of graphics between the classic style and that of the WiiWare version and the music of the original game, the WiiWare port, or the 3DS update. It also features an exclusive 'Wind Fortress' level. The game got an update that added an exclusive Machine Gun Challenge. The game was included as a bonus game in the Humble Indie Bundle 4 sale in December 2011, Humble Bundle 7 in December 2012, and was released on the Desura service in April 2012. On 19 January 2017, Nicalis announced a port of Cave Story+ on the Nintendo Switch, which released on 20 June 2017. This version is packaged with a full-color manual for the game and a Mini CD containing arrangements of the game's soundtrack made in FamiTracker, a chiptune music tracker based on the Famicom's synthesizers; a later update also added two-player cooperative gameplay. Additionally, GameStop purchases of the Nintendo Switch version include one of three keychains modeled after Quote, Curly, and Balrog. =Cave Story 3D= Cave Story 3D is a 3D version of the game developed by Nicalis and published by NIS America as a retail title for the Nintendo 3DS. It was released on 8 November 2011 in North America, 11 November 2011 in Europe and 26 July 2012 in Japan. The game was built from scratch using 3D character models, featuring a dynamic camera system and another additional level, as well as a remixed soundtrack by Danny Baranowsky. The Japanese version features crossover content from various NIS and other companies' franchises such as Crazy Climber, Ikki, and Dragon Slayer. In order to devote more time to perfecting the title, Amaya quit his job as a software developer to become director of Cave Story 3D. He remarked that the transition to 3D was difficult because it required the consideration of so many more details. Reception The original Cave Story earned widespread critical acclaim. 1UP.com described it as \\"so massive that it rivals modern [Game Boy Advance] Castlevania and Metroid games in terms of scope and play time\\". Matt Miller of Game Informer observed that Cave Story combines elements of Metroid, Ninja Gaiden, Mega Man, The Legend of Zelda, and Castlevania into an \\"engrossing, challenging, and quite lengthy\\" whole. Inside Mac Games ascribed the game's popularity to its \\"polished feel, engaging storyline, and compelling artwork\\". Electronic Gaming Monthly stated that \\"the burgeoning Western indie game scene owes a tremendous debt to Japanese pioneers like Studio Pixel, whose freeware hit Cave Story proved that with sufficient vision, skill, and passion, a single developer can still craft a deep, compelling action game\\". Jonathan Holmes of Destructoid compared the game design to that of Shigeru Miyamoto in its ability to teach without tutorials, like at the beginning of Super Mario Bros. In July 2006, Cave Story earned 1st place in Super PLAY's list of the 50 best freeware games of all time. In July 2015, the game placed 14th on USgamer's The 15 Best Games Since 2000 list. The WiiWare version has received mostly positive reviews, with the central criticism being the 1200 Wii Point price tag (US$12, ¬£10), after years of free play. Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com commended the graphical update, which \\"sacrifices none of [the game's] classic-influenced charm\\". He also remarked that the Classic Controller and Wii Remote are superior to the keyboard input of the PC original. On the issue of price, he explained that \\"the prospect of Amaya finally earning a little something for the hard work he invested in this masterpiece strikes me as satisfyingly poetic\\" and \\"absolutely worth your money\\". John Teti of Eurogamer had similar sentiments, but also noted the technical issues with the remixed music, recommending the original soundtrack. Edge compared the remake to The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition, satisfying both modern tastes with its graphical overhaul and old school fans with the option to switch to the original graphics. Daemon Hatfield of IGN felt that Cave Story \\"belongs on a Nintendo system\\" and noted gameplay similarities to Blaster Master, in which damage reduces the power of weapons as well. Cave Story was nominated for Game of the Year at the 2010 Nintendo Power Awards, as well as WiiWare Game of the Year. Criticism of Cave Story 3D echoed that of the WiiWare version. Many reviewers cautioned that the graphical update does not justify the $40 initial price point, especially with cheaper or free versions of the game available through download services. Parish defended the release, deriving satisfaction from the game's availability as a physical cartridge. Holmes praised the dynamic camera system and new graphics, comparing them to Disney films. He considers this release to be the \\"best version of the game, [but] not necessarily the definitive version\\". Jane Douglas of GameSpot felt that the 3DS Circle Pad was a comfortable fit for the game's control scheme. Audrey Drake of IGN noted that the 3D effect made it difficult to distinguish certain platforms between background and foreground, a complaint shared by Douglas. Simon Parkin of the UK Official Nintendo Magazine was more critical, citing lack of detail in the 3D models and a too-dark color palette. Japanese magazine Famitsu Weeklys four reviewers scored it 7, 7, 8, and 8 points out of 10 to a total of 30 out of 40 points, indicating average reviews. This version was nominated for Best Adventure Game at the 2011 Nintendo Power Awards. , Cave Story+ has sold an estimated 590,104 digital units on Steam.

The game had an impact on the indie game industry, with its acclaim and success demonstrating that a one-person team could rival major studios. It is also one of the most internationally successful Japanese indie (d≈çjin soft) games, and contributed to the resurgence of the Metroidvania genre. The game's critical acclaim demonstrated the scope of what one person could do, and highlighted another take on the Metroidvania genre. It also vitalized the 2D platform game genre as a viable indie game format. The success of Cave Story paved the way for a large number of retro-themed 2D platformers that have appeared since the mid-2000s, including the likes of Braid (2008), Super Meat Boy (2010), Fez (2012) and Mega Man 11 (2018). Jonathan Holmes of Destructoid called Cave Story an \\"important game\\", observing its influence on artistic indie games like Braid, as well as the continued relevance of 2D game design (cf. Capcom's Mega Man 9).

All 73 people on board the Douglas DC-8 aircraft were killed. Two time bombs were used, whose explosives have been variously described as dynamite or C-4. The crash killed every member of the Cuban National Fencing team. Several CIA-linked anti-Castro Cuban exiles were implicated by the evidence. Political complications quickly arose when Cuba accused the US government of being an accomplice to the attack. CIA documents released in 2005 indicate that the agency \\"had concrete advance intelligence, as early as June 1976, on plans by Cuban exile terrorist groups to bomb a Cubana airliner.\\" Former CIA terrorist operative Luis Posada Carriles denies involvement but provides many details of the incident in his book Caminos del Guerrero (Ways of the Warrior).Posada Carriles, Luis 1994 (accessed 4-13-07) Los Caminos del Guerrero. Latin American Studies The Coordination of United Revolutionary Organizations, of which Carriles was a member, is widely seen as responsible for the bombing. Four men were arrested in connection with the bombing, and a trial was held in Venezuela. Freddy Lugo and Hern√°n Ricardo Lozano were each sentenced to 20-year prison terms. Orlando Bosch was acquitted and later moved to Miami, Florida, where he lived until his death on April 27, 2011. Luis Posada Carriles was held for eight years while awaiting a final sentence but eventually fled. He later entered the United States, where he was held on charges of entering the country illegally, but was released on April 19, 2007.  Background  On June 11, 1976, Coordination of United Revolutionary Organizations (CORU) was founded in the Dominican Republic. CORU united five anti-Castro Cuban exile groups,Jean-Guy Allard, Granma, 26 December 2005, The U.S. ignored Costa Rican proposal to extradite Bosch including Alpha 66 and Omega 7. For three months prior to the bombing of Flight 455, CORU waged a campaign of violence against several Caribbean countries which had established links with Cuba. In July 1976, the same flight was targeted in Jamaica by a suitcase bomb which exploded shortly before being loaded onto the plane.Cuban exiles 'bombed jet', The Guardian, 8 October 1976. Other bombings in the summer included a number of offices of airlines carrying out business with Cuba, including the offices of the BWIA West Indies Airways in Barbados; of Air Panama in Colombia; and of Iberia and Nanaco Line in Costa Rica. Other attacks included the murder of a Cuban official in Mexico and two more Cuban officials in Argentina; the September assassination of Orlando Letelier in Washington, D.C.; and \\"a mysterious fire in Guyana [which] destroyed a large quantity of Cuban-supplied fishing equipment.\\"  Preparations  On October 5, 1976, Lugo and Hern√°n Ricardo Lozano left Caracas for Trinidad, arriving at 1 a.m. The following day, they sought to board Cubana de Aviaci√≥n's Flight CU-455, which was scheduled to fly from Guyana to Havana, Cuba, via Trinidad, Barbados, and Kingston. They rejected the offer of an earlier flight with British West Indies Airways (BWIA). With a member of the Cuban fencing team waiting for the Cubana flight assisting with interpretation, the pair were able to insist on boarding the later Cubana flight. The pair left the flight at Barbados, and later returned to Trinidad.  Crash  Eleven minutes after takeoff from Barbadoss Seawell Airport (now Grantley Adams International Airport) and at an altitude of 18,000 feet, two bombs exploded on board. One was located in the aircraft's rear lavatory, and another in the midsection of the passenger cabin. The former ultimately destroyed the aircraft's control cables, while the latter blasted a hole in the aircraft and started a fire. The plane went into a rapid descent, while the pilots tried unsuccessfully to return the plane to Seawell Airport. The captain, Wilfredo P√©rez P√©rez, radioed to the control tower: \\"We have an explosion aboard ‚Äì we are descending immediately! ... We have fire on board! We are requesting immediate landing! We have a total emergency!\\" Realizing a successful landing was no longer possible, it appears that the pilot turned the craft away from the beach and towards the Caribbean Sea off porters St James, saving the lives of many tourists. The crash occurred about eight kilometres short of the airport. All 48 passengers and 25 crew aboard the plane died: the passengers comprised 57 Cubans, 11 Guyanese, and 5 North Koreans. Among the dead were all 24 members of the 1975 national Cuban fencing team that had just won all the gold medals in the Central American and Caribbean Championships; many were teenagers. Several officials of the Cuban government were also aboard the plane: Manuel Permuy Hern√°ndez, director of the National Institute of Sports (INDER); Jorge de la Nuez Su√°rez, secretary for the shrimp fleet; Alfonso Gonz√°lez, National Commissioner of firearm sports; and Domingo Chac√≥n Coello, an agent from the Interior Ministry.http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/belligerence/caso-avion- cubano-4.pdf The 11 Guyanese passengers included five travelling to Cuba to study medicine, and the young wife of a Guyanese diplomat. The five Koreans were government officials and a cameraman.  Judicial proceedings  =Arrests= Hours after the explosions, Trinidad authorities arrested Freddy Lugo and Hernan Ricardo Lozano, two Venezuelan men who had boarded the plane in Trinidad and checked their baggage to Cuba, but who had exited the plane in Barbados and flown back to Trinidad. Lozano had been traveling with a false identity under the name of Jos√© V√°zquez Garc√≠a. Lugo and Lozano confessed, and declared they were acting under the orders of Luis Posada Carriles, a CIA operative. Their testimony, along with other evidence, implicated Posada and fellow CIA operative Orlando Bosch, an anti-Castro Cuban living in Venezuela. On October 14, 1976, Posada and Bosch were arrested in Caracas, Venezuela, and the offices of Investigaciones Comerciales e Industriales C.A. (ICICA), a private investigator's company owned by Posada, were raided. Weapons, explosives and a radio transmitter were found. Lozano was an employee of ICICA at the time of the attack, while Lugo worked as a photographer for the Ministry of Mines and Hydrocarbons. On October 20, authorities of Trinidad, Cuba, Barbados, Guyana and Venezuela held a meeting in Port of Spain, during which it was decided to hold the trial in Caracas, Venezuela, since the four accused were citizens of that country. Shortly after, Lugo and Lozano were deported to Venezuela. =Military trial= On August 25, 1977, Judge Delia Estava Moreno referred the case to a military tribunal, charging all four co- conspirators with treason. In September 1980, a Venezuelan military judge acquitted all four men. The prosecutor appealed, arguing that a military court was the wrong forum to try the case for two reasons: none of the men were military personnel in 1976, and the crime of qualified homicide or aggravated homicide cannot be tried by a military tribunal. The Military Court of Appeals agreed and surrendered jurisdiction, rendering the acquittal moot. The Judge ruled that the accused \\"are civilians and the crimes imputed to them are governed by the penal (and not the military) code... Civilians and common law crimes are not subject to the dispositions of the Code of Military Justice...\\" =Civilian trial= The four were then charged with aggravated homicide and treason before a civilian court. On August 8, 1985, Venezuelan judge Alberto Perez Marcano of the 11th Penal Court convicted Lugo and Ricardo, sentencing them each to 20 years in prison. The judge reduced the penalty to its lowest limit \\"due to the extenuating circumstance of no prior criminal records.\\" Orlando Bosch was acquitted, because the evidence gathered by the Barbados authorities during the investigation could not be used in the Venezuela trial, as it was presented too late and had not been translated into Spanish. Posada fled from the San Juan de los Morros penitentiary on the eve of the pronouncement of his sentence. He had been confined there following two previous failed escape attempts. Allegations were made that Venezuelan authorities were bribed to help him escape. No verdict was entered against Posada because, according to the Venezuelan Penal Code, judicial proceedings cannot continue without the presence of the accused. The court issued an arrest warrant against him which was still pending . =Aftermath= A different judge then ordered the case reviewed by a higher court. The Venezuelan government declined to appeal the case any further, and in November 1987 Bosch was freed. He had spent 11 years in jail despite having been acquitted twice. Lugo and Lozano were released in 1993 and continue to reside in Venezuela. Posada then fled to Panama and to the United States. In April 2005, a new warrant for his arrest in connection with the bombing was issued in Venezuela by the government of Hugo Ch√°vez. However, a U.S. immigration judge ruled that Posada should not be deported to Cuba or Venezuela because he could be subject to torture in those countries. In 2007, Congressman Bill Delahunt and Jose Pertierra, an immigration lawyer representing the government of Venezuela, argued that Posada could be deported on the grounds that the U.S. was making an exception for Posada. Because, they argued, the U.S. practices extraordinary rendition involving the seizure and transportation of suspected terrorists to Syria and Egypt, both of which practice torture, the U.S. could also deport Posada, a terrorist, to Cuba or Venezuela.http://www.abc.net.au/26 June 2007 Freed from Venezuelan charges, Bosch went to the United States, assisted by US Ambassador to Venezuela Otto Reich; there, he was ultimately arrested for a parole violation. On 18 July 1990, Bosch was pardoned of all American charges by President George H. W. Bush at the request of his son Jeb Bush, who later became Governor of Florida; this pardon was despite objections by the President's own defense department that Bosch was one of the most deadly terrorists working \\"within the hemisphere.\\"638 Ways to Kill Castro, Channel 4 Television, 28 November 2006: TV documentary covering the many attempts by the CIA to eliminate Cuban leader Fidel Castro, a segment of which focused upon the Flight 455 bombing. Although many countries sought Bosch's extradition, he remained free in the United States. The political pressure to grant Bosch a pardon was begun during the congressional campaign run by Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, herself a Cuban American, and overseen by her campaign manager Jeb Bush. In 2005, Posada was held by U.S. authorities in Texas on the charge of illegal presence on national territory before the charges were dismissed on May 8, 2007. His release on bail on April 19, 2007, had elicited angry reactions from the Cuban and Venezuelan governments.Push to free convicted Cuban spies reaches D.C., Miami Herald, September 22, 2006 The U.S. Justice Department had urged the court to keep him in jail because he was \\"an admitted mastermind of terrorist plots and attacks\\", a flight risk and a danger to the community. On September 28, 2005, a U.S. immigration judge ruled that Posada could not be deported because he faced the threat of torture in Venezuela.No deportation for Cuban militant (BBC)  FBI and CIA knowledge  Declassified FBI report that reads: \\"Our confidential source ascertained (...) that the bombing of the Cubana Airlines DC-8 was planned, in part, in Caracas, Venezuela, at two meetings attended by Morales Navarrete, Luis Posada Carriles and Frank Castro\\"Declassified FBI report on bombing of Cubana Flight 455, dated 5 November 1976 (Archive) Luis Posada Carriles, a Cuban-born naturalized Venezuelan, was the Director of Counterintelligence at Venezuela's FBI equivalent, the DISIP, from 1967 to 1974. A U.S. Government document released through FOIA also confirms Posada's status with the CIA: \\"Luis Posada, in whom CIA has an operational interest - Posada is receiving approximately $300 per month from CIA\\". Posada was heavily involved with right-wing anti-Castro groups, in particular the Cuban-American National Foundation (CANF) and the Coordinadora de Organizaciones Revolucionarias Unidas (Coordination of United Revolutionary Organizations - CORU), led at the time by Orlando Bosch. According to documents, Posada stopped being a CIA asset in 1974, but there remained \\"occasional contact\\" until June 1976, a few months before the bombing. CIA had concrete advance intelligence, as early as June 1976, on possible plans by Cuban exile terrorist groups to bomb a Cubana airliner, and the FBI's attach√© in Caracas had multiple contacts with one of the Venezuelans who placed the bomb on the plane, and provided him with a visa to the U.S. five days before the bombing, despite suspicions that he was engaged in terrorist activities at the direction of Luis Posada Carriles. A declassified CIA document dated October 12, 1976, a few days after the bombing, quotes Posada as saying, a few days after a plate fund-raising meeting for CORU held around September 15, \\"We are going to hit a Cuban airliner... Orlando has the details\\" (Source Comment: The identities of \\"We\\" and \\"Orlando\\" were not known at the time.)Declassified CIA document dated October 14, 1976 (Archive) A declassified FBI document dated October 21, 1976, quotes CORU member Secundino Carrera as stating that CORU \\"was responsible for the bombing of the Cubana Airlines DC-8 on October 6, 1976... this bombing and the resulting deaths were fully justified because CORU was at war with the Fidel Castro regime.\\" Carrera also expressed his pleasure over the attention paid to the United States over the bombing, as it was taking attention off of himself and his associate. (Archive) Documents released by the National Security Archive on May 3, 2007, reveal the links Posada had to the 1976 Cubana airline bombing and other terrorist attacks and plots, including a British West Indian Airways office in Barbados and the Guyanese Embassy in Trinidad. These provide additional proof of Posada's involvement in violent efforts to undermine Castro's socialist government, said Peter Kornbluh, director of the National Security Archive's Cuba Documentation Project. The Archive is an independent research organization located at George Washington University.  Memorials  This memorial was erected in recognition of the 73 people who were killed in the crash of Cubana Flight 455 just off the coast of Bridgetown, Barbados, in early October 1976. A monument was erected at Payne's Bay, Saint James, Barbados, to the memory of the people killed in the bombing. It was visited several times by Fidel Castro and other Cuban and Venezuelan officials, including a visit during the CARICOM meeting in December 2005, during which Cuban officials called for Posada \\"to be brought to justice so as to bring closure to this egregious incident that caused so much pain to the people of the region.\\" In October 2012, an additional monument to the tragedy was unveiled in Guyana, South America at the Turkeyen campus of the University of Guyana.

Its business lines included agricultural equipment, construction equipment, power generation and power transmission equipment, and machinery for use in industrial settings such as factories, flour mills, sawmills, textile mills, steel mills, refineries, mines, and ore mills. The first Allis-Chalmers Company was formed in 1901 as an amalgamation of the Edward P. Allis Company (steam engines and mill equipment), Fraser & Chalmers (mining and ore milling equipment), the Gates Iron Works (rock and cement milling equipment), and the industrial business line of the Dickson Manufacturing Company (engines and compressors). It was reorganized in 1912 as the Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Company. During the next 70 years its industrial machinery filled countless mills, mines, and factories around the world, and its brand gained fame among consumers mostly from its farm equipment business's orange tractors and silver combine harvesters. In the 1980s and 1990s, a series of divestitures transformed the firm and eventually dissolved it. Its successors today are Allis-Chalmers Energy and AGCO. History =Overview= Author-photographer Randy Leffingwell (1993). aptly summarized the firm's origins and character. He observed that it \\"grew by acquiring and consolidating the innovations\\" of various smaller firms and building upon them; and he continued that \\"Metal work and machinery were the common background. Financial successes and failures brought them together.\\" Former marketing executive Walter M. Buescher (1991) said that Allis-Chalmers \\"was a conglomerate before the word was coined.\\". Whether or not it is literally true that Allis-Chalmers predated the sense of \\"conglomerate\\" meaning a widely diversified parent corporation, Buescher's point is valid: Allis-Chalmers, despite its common theme of machinery, was an amalgamation of disparate business lines, each with a unique marketplace, beginning in an era when consolidations within industries were fashionable but those across industries were not yet common. =1800s to 1901= Edward P. Allis was an entrepreneur who in 1860 bought a bankrupt firm at a sheriff's auction, the Reliance Works of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, which had been owned by James Decker and Charles Seville. Decker & Seville were millwrights who made equipment for flour milling. Under Allis's management, the firm was reinvigorated and \\"began producing steam engines and other mill equipment just at the time that many sawmills and flour mills were converting to steam power.\\" Although the financial panic of 1873 \\"caught Edward Allis overextended\\" and forced him into bankruptcy, \\"his own reputation saved him and reorganization came quickly,\\" forming the Edward P. Allis Company. Leffingwell said, \\"He set out to hire known experts: George Hinkley, who perfected the band saw; William Gray, who revolutionized the flour-milling process through roller milling; and Edwin Reynolds, who ran the Corliss Steam Engine works.\\" Allis died in 1889, but under his sons (Charles Allis and William Allis) and the other principals, the firm continued to prosper, and by 1900 it had grown to become one of America's largest steam engine builders.. Gates Iron Works, Interior, 1896Arnold, Horace L. \\"Modern Machine-Shop Economics. Part II\\" in Engineering Magazine 11. 1896 Thomas Chalmers was a Scottish immigrant to America who came to the U.S. about 1842. By 1844 he was at Chicago, Illinois and had found work with P.W. Gates, whose foundry and blacksmithing shops produced plows, wagons, and flour-milling equipment. The Gates firm \\"built the first steam-operated sawmill in the country at a time when Chicago was the leading producer of milled lumber in the country.\\" In 1872, Thomas Chalmers founded the Fraser & Chalmers firm to manufacture mining machinery, boilers, and pumps. By 1880 steam engines were part of the product line and by 1890, the firm had become one of the world's largest manufacturers of mining equipment. Thomas Chalmers's son, William James Chalmers, was president of the company from circa 1890 to 1901. Meanwhile, the Gates Iron Works, with Chalmers family involvement, had become a manufacturer of crushers, pulverizers, and other rock and cement milling equipment. Another Scottish immigrant family, the Dickson family, came to Canada and the U.S. in the 1830s. By 1852, they had organized a small machine shop and foundry (Dickson & Company) in Scranton, Pennsylvania. In 1856 Thomas Dickson became its president, and in 1862 the firm incorporated as the Dickson Manufacturing Company. By 1900 they were building boilers, steam engines, locomotives, internal combustion engines, blowers, and air compressors. By 1901 the principals of the Edward P. Allis, Fraser & Chalmers, and Gates firms had decided to merge their companies. Edwin Reynolds believed Allis could control the industrial engine business. In May 1901 the Allis-Chalmers Company was formed. It acquired Dickson's industrial engine business. Dickson's locomotive business was rolled into the new locomotive consolidation, the American Locomotive Company (ALCO). =1901‚Äì1911= Allis-Chalmers Bisbee converter for smelting copper ore, 1902 A photo, in the journal Cement Age, 1910, of a rotary cement kiln built by Allis-Chalmers The managing director of the new company was Charles Allis, his brother William was chairman of the board, and William J. Chalmers was deputy managing director. Shortly after the merger was completed, a new factory was built in an area west of Milwaukee that was then known as North Greenfield. In 1902, with this new factory, the locale was renamed West Allis, Wisconsin. Allis-Chalmer alternator is powerhouse With the combining of the constituent firms, Allis-Chalmers offered a wide array of pyrometallurgic equipment, such as blast furnaces and converters for roasting, smelting, and refining; ore milling equipment, various kinds of crushers and pulverizers, including stamp mills, roller mills, ball mills, conical mills, rod mills, and jigging mills; cyanidation mills and other concentration mills; hoisting engines; cars, including skip cars, slag cars, and general mine cars; briquetting plants; and the pumps, tanks, boilers, compressors, hydraulic accumulators, pipes, valves, sieves, and conveyors needed within these products. Like other firms that build capital equipment for industrial corporations, it also supplied consulting, erecting, and training services, such as helping a mining company to design a plant, to build its buildings and set up its machinery, and to teach the employees how to use and maintain it.. In 1903, Allis-Chalmers acquired the Bullock Electric Company of Cincinnati, Ohio, which added steam turbines to Allis-Chalmers's powerplant equipment business line. =1912-1919= An Allis-Chalmers Corliss type stationary engine. By 1912, the Allis-Chalmers Company was in financial trouble, so it was reorganized. It was renamed the Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Company, and Otto Falk, a former Brigadier General of the Wisconsin National Guard, was appointed to turn it around. Falk pushed for new products and new or expanded markets. Falk saw great growth potential in the mechanization of agriculture, which at the time was blossoming all over America. Allis-Chalmers's first farm tractors, the 10-18, the Model 6-12, and the Model 15-30, were developed and marketed between 1914 and 1919, and the farm implement line was expanded. =1920s= An Allis-Chalmers tractor advertisement in Farm Mechanics, 1921, showing the models 6-12, 12-20, and 18-30 United tractor on display at Heidrick Ag History Center, Woodland, California, USA As had also been true of the 1900‚Äì1920 period, the Roaring Twenties were a favorable time for consolidation and even conglomeration throughout the business world. It was also a time of strongly continuing mechanization on North American farms. At Allis-Chalmers, the 1920s brought yet more tractors, such as the 18-30, the 12-20, the 15-25, and the United tractor/Model U. Famed inventor and engineer Nikola Tesla spent the period 1919-1922 working in Milwaukee for Allis- Chalmers.\\"Wizard: The Life And Times Of Nikola Tesla: The Life and Times of Nikola Tesla\\" by Marc Seifer - page 398 In 1926 Falk hired Harry Merritt,.. who would be a senior executive in Allis-Chalmers's tractor business for many years. Merritt had worked in the sales and marketing of various brands of farm and construction equipment, most recently Holt, when Falk hired him away. Buescher, who worked under Merritt, credited Merritt with turning around Allis-Chalmers's ailing farm equipment business and transforming it into the main profit center for the parent corporation. He said, \\"Some say that General Falk pulled Harry Merritt into Milwaukee to liquidate the ailing tractor division. Others say that he was brought in to breathe new life into the moribund and unprofitable operation. Even if the first appraisal is correct, the second proved to be the way it turned out. [‚Ä¶] After Merritt's arrival, the profit picture changed. The farm equipment business proved to be a financial lifesaver for the corporation. [‚Ä¶] From next to nothing in 1927, Merritt saw the percentage of farm equipment business go to just short of sixty percent of corporate sales.\\" Also in 1926, Allis-Chalmers acquired Nordyke Marmon & Company of Indianapolis, Indiana, a maker of flour-milling equipment. In 1927, it acquired the Pittsburgh Transformer Company, a maker of electrical transformers. In 1928, Allis-Chalmers acquired the Monarch Tractor Company of Springfield, Illinois, thus adding a line of crawler tractors., p. 32. In 1929, it acquired the La Crosse Plow Works of La Crosse, Wisconsin. The La Crosse Plow Works had a good-quality plow and various desirable implements, which now expanded the Allis-Chalmers implement line.. Also in 1929, Harry Merritt was in California when the bright orange California poppy blossoms inspired him to think about the use of bright colors in marketing. Brightly colored things that can be seen from far away had potential in farm equipment marketing. He soon changed the paint color of Allis-Chalmers's tractors to Persian Orange, the available paint color that he felt most closely resembled the California poppy's color. Thus began the tradition of orange Allis- Chalmers tractors. Various competitors would follow suit over the next decade, as International Harvester switched to all-red (1936), Minneapolis-Moline switched to Prairie Gold (late 1930s), and Case switched to Flambeau Red (late 1930s). John Deere already had a distinctive color scheme with its bright green and yellow. In 1928, Henry Ford canceled U.S. production of the Fordson tractor. This disrupted the business of many firms: farm equipment dealers who sold Fordsons and aftermarket equipment builders whose attachments were designed to mount on Fordsons (for example, the Gleaner combines of the 1920s mounted on Fordsons, and many Fordson industrial tractors used aftermarket attachments). Many of these firms formed a conglomerate in 1928 called the United Tractor & Equipment corporation. United arranged a deal with Allis- Chalmers to build a tractor to substitute for the now-missing Fordson. Around 1930, the United conglomerate collapsed. The reasons that various authors have given have been disagreements between its investors, the onset of the Great Depression, and the fact that Ford Motor Company Ltd of England, which was continuing the Fordson line independently of the U.S. Ford company, began exporting new Fordsons to America. The United tractor became the Allis- Chalmers Model U. =1930s= A two-row corn picker A 1939 Model WC Fordson behind it The 1930s were a pivotal decade. Despite the Great Depression, Allis-Chalmers succeeded as demand for its machinery continued. In 1931, it acquired Advance-Rumely of La Porte, Indiana, mostly because Merritt wanted the company's network of 24 branch houses and about 2,500 dealers, which would greatly increase Allis-Chalmers's marketing and sales power in the farm equipment business.. Also in 1931, the corporation's electrical equipment business expanded via acquisition when Brown, Boveri & Cie, in a financial pinch because of the Depression, sold its U.S. electrical operations to Allis- Chalmers., p. 339. After 1931 Allis-Chalmers was the licensee for U.S. sales of European products of Brown, Boveri & Cie. In 1932, Allis-Chalmers collaborated with Firestone to introduce pneumatic rubber tires to tractors.. The innovation quickly spread industry-wide, as (to many farmers' surprise) it improved tractive force and fuel economy in the range of 10% to 20%. Within only 5 years, pneumatic rubber tires had displaced cleated steel wheels across roughly half of all tractors sold industry-wide. Cleated steel remained optional equipment into the 1940s. Also in 1932, Allis-Chalmers acquired the Ryan Manufacturing Company, which added various grader models to its construction equipment line. In 1933, Allis-Chalmers introduced its Model WC, its first-generation row-crop tractor, which would become its highest-selling tractor ever. In 1937, its lighter and more affordable second-generation row- crop, the Model B, arrived, and also became a top seller. Its All-Crop Harvester was the market leader in pull-type (tractor-drawn) combine harvesters. In October 1937, Allis-Chalmers was one of fourteen major electrical manufacturing companies that went to court to change the way labor unions excluded contractors and products in the building trades through the union use of the \\"Men and Means Clause\\". The action of Allis-Chalmers and others eventually resulted in the U.S. Supreme Court decision of June 18, 1945, that ended certain union practices that violated the Sherman Antitrust Act. =1940s= An M6 tractor for military use An Allis-Chalmers Model WD World War II caused Allis-Chalmers, like most other manufacturing companies, to become extremely busy. As happened with many firms, its civilian product lines experienced a period of being \\"on hold\\", with emphasis on parts and service to keep existing machines running,. but its war materiel production was pushed to the maximum of productivity and output. In the late 1930s through mid-1940s, Allis-Chalmers made machinery for naval ships, such as Liberty ship steam engines, steam turbines, generators, and electric motors; artillery tractors and tractors for other army use; electrical switches and controls; and other products. Allis-Chalmers was also one of many firms contracted to build equipment for the Manhattan Project. Its experience in mining and milling machinery made it a logical choice for uranium mining and processing equipment. Allis-Chalmers ranked 45th among United States corporations in the value of wartime military production contracts.Peck, Merton J. & Scherer, Frederic M. The Weapons Acquisition Process: An Economic Analysis (1962) Harvard Business School p.619 Immediately at the war's end, in 1945‚Äì1946, Allis-Chalmers endured a crippling 11-month labor strike.. Buescher was convinced that the corporation never entirely recovered from the effects of this strike.. This seems debatable given the various successes that Allis- Chalmers did have during the next 30 years, including prosperity in the farm equipment business in the 1950s and 1960s. But it certainly gave competitors a chance to grab market share. After WWII some companies refused to sell equipment to Japanese farmers. Allis-Chalmers dealers did not hesitate to sell to these farmers so many farms to this day still have an Allis-Chalmers tractor in Oregon. In 1948, the Model WC was improved with various new features and became the Model WD, another top seller. The WD was a milestone for the company. It included fully independent power take off, which was powered by a two clutch system.. It also included power adjust rear wheels, which became an industry standard. Production of this model continued into 1953, with nearly 150,000 tractors produced.. =1950s= An Allis-Chalmers HD-15A bulldozer An Allis-Chalmers Model D15 tractor The 1950s were a time of great demand for more power in farm tractors, as well as greater capability from their hydraulic and electrical systems. It was also a decade of extensive dieselization, from railroad locomotives to farm tractors and construction equipment. In 1953, Allis-Chalmers acquired the Buda Engine Company of Harvey, Illinois. Allis wanted Buda for its line of diesel engines,.. because its previous supplier, Detroit Diesel, was a division of General Motors, whose recent acquisition of the Euclid heavy equipment company now made it a competitor of Allis-Chalmers for construction equipment business. The Buda- Lanova models were re-christened the \\"Allis-Chalmers Diesel\\" engine line. Diesel engineers were busy during the following years updating and expanding the line. In 1952, the company acquired Laplant- Choate,https://contractormag.co.nz/classic-machines/laplant-choate/ which added various models of scrapers to its construction equipment line. In 1953, the WD-45 was introduced, replacing the WD. The motor was increased to 226 cubic inches, giving it 30 horsepower on the drawbar at the Nebraska Tests http://www.ritchiewiki.com/wiki/index.php/University_of_Nebraska_Tractor_Test. This was almost double the horsepower of the WD. A new Allis chalmers designed Snap- Coupler hitch was used. It allowed the operator to hook up to an implement from the seat of the tractor. A Buda diesel-powered WD-45 was introduced in 1955. This series stayed in production until the unveiling of the D-series in 1957. In 1955, the company acquired Gleaner Manufacturing Company, which was an important move for its combine harvester business. Allis was the market leader in pull-type (tractor-drawn) combines, with its All-Crop Harvester line. But acquiring Gleaner meant that it would now also be a leader in self-propelled machines, and it would own two of the leading brands in combines. The Gleaner line augmented (and later superseded) the All-Crop Harvester line, and for several years Gleaner's profits made up nearly all of Allis-Chalmers' profit.. Gleaners continued to be manufactured at the same factory, in Independence, Missouri, after the acquisition. In 1957, the Allis- Chalmers D Series of tractors was introduced. It enjoyed great success over the next decade. In 1959, Allis-Chalmers acquired the French company Vendeuvre. Also in 1959, it acquired Tractomotive Corporation of Deerfield, Illinois, which it had been partnering with as an auxiliary equipment supplier for at least a decade. In Haycraft's history of the construction equipment business (2000), he expressed the view that Allis-Chalmers relied too heavily for too long on partnering with auxiliary equipment suppliers, and acquiring them, instead of investing in in-house product development. In his view, this strategy limited the company's success in this business, and it eventually had to spend the development dollars anyway. Buescher's comments about the Buda acquisition and the need for subsequent improvement of its designs seem to corroborate this view. However, the topic is multivariate and complex; elsewhere in his memoir,. Buescher presents a viewpoint in which investing in research and product development is an expensive move that often does not pay off for the innovator and mostly benefits competitor clones. =1960s and 1970s= harrow 1965 Gleaner E harvester An Allis-Chalmers D21 Series II tractor In 1960, the U.S. government uncovered an attempt to form a cartel in the heavy electric equipment industry. It charged 13 companies, including the largest in the industry (Westinghouse, General Electric, and Allis-Chalmers), with price fixing and bid rigging. Most feigned innocence, but Allis-Chalmers pleaded guilty. Although one motive for the forming of cartels is so that amply profitable firms can try to become obscenely profitable, it did not apply in this instance, according to Buescher; rather, his view of the attempt at a heavy-electrical cartel was that it was a desperate (and foolish) attempt to turn red ink to black ink among fierce competition.. The D series continued to be successful in the 1960s. The factory-installed turbocharger on the D19 was the first in the industry. It was soon followed by the 190 and the 190 XT, which was a direct competitor for the John Deere Model 4020 with 98 horsepower (factory rating). In 1965, Allis-Chalmers acquired Simplicity for its line of lawn and garden equipment. Also in that year, the nuclear reactor SAFARI-1, a research reactor built by Allis-Chalmers, went into operation.Study Commission on U.S. Policy toward Southern Africa (U.S.), South Africa: Time Running Out : the Report of the Study Commission on U.S p. 345 In the 1960s, the farm equipment, construction equipment, and heavy electrical industries were not as profitable for Allis-Chalmers as they had been in the 1930s through 1950s. Reasonable prosperity continued in the farm equipment line, but the economics of all the industries shifted toward greater uncertainty and brittler success for firms that didn't become number one or two in a field. Allis-Chalmers was often number three or four, as Deere and International Harvester led in farm machinery, Caterpillar and Case led in construction, and Westinghouse and General Electric led in heavy electric markets. In the late 1960s, a trend of conglomeration flared, as mega-conglomerates like Ling-Temco-Vought, Gulf+Western, and White Consolidated Industries went on buying sprees. Several takeover attempts by those firms were made on Allis-Chalmers. It was during the same era and business climate that Tenneco acquired Case. In 1960, Allis- Chalmers built the first grate-kiln ore pellet plant at the Humboldt mine in Michigan. The company eventually built about 50 such plants.J. Stjernberg, O. Isaksson, J. C. Ion. \\"The grate-kiln induration machine - history, advantages, and drawbacks, and outline for the future\\". Journal of the Southern African Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, February, 2015. In 1974, Allis-Chalmers's construction equipment business was reorganized into a joint venture with Fiat SpA,. which bought a 65% majority stake at the outset. The new company was called Fiat-Allis. In May 1975, the company closed its 20-acre, 78-year-old Pittsburgh North Side factory that employed close to 1,100 full-time and produced both distribution and instrument control transformers. In 1977, to compete in the recently expanding market segment of compact diesel utility tractors (such as the Kubota line and the Ford 1000 and 1600 built by Shibaura), Allis-Chalmers began importing Hinomoto tractors with Toyosha diesel engines from Japan. They were rebadged with the Allis-Chalmers brand for U.S. sales. In 1978, a joint venture with Siemens, Siemens-Allis, was formed, supplying electrical control equipment. =1980s and 1990s= An Allis-Chalmers 7060 in Wisconsin The company began to struggle in the 1980s in a climate of rapid economic change. It was forced amid financial struggles to sell major business lines. In 1983, Allis-Chalmers sold Simplicity, the lawn and garden equipment division, to the division's management. 1985 was a year of great dissolution for Allis-Chalmers‚Äîthe year when it folded three of its main business lines: * The Fiat-Allis joint venture in construction equipment, over which the firms' managements had long since had a falling-out, ended when Fiat bought out Allis's remaining minority stake. It renamed the company Fiatallis.. * The Allis-Chalmers farm equipment business line ended when Allis sold it to K-H-D (Kl√∂ckner-Humboldt-Deutz, Deutz AG) of Germany, at the time the owner of Deutz-Fahr. K-H-D renamed the business as Deutz-Allis and discarded the Allis Chalmers 8000 Series tractors and Persian Orange branding in favor of spring green tractors built by White Farm Equipment with Deutz air cooled engines. * The Siemens-Allis joint venture in electrical controls ended when Siemens bought out Allis's remaining minority stake. Siemens then blended the company into the Siemens Energy and Automation division. In 1988, Allis- Chalmers sold its American Air Filter filtration business (with 27 production facilities internationally and sales into 100-plus countries) for approximately $225 million to SnyderGeneral Corporation of Dallas, a leading global air quality control firm. In 1990, Deutz-Allis was sold to its management and became Allis-Gleaner Corporation (AGCO). Tractors began selling under the AGCO-Allis name and were again painted Persian Orange. The AGCO brand of orange tractors was produced until 2010 when AGCO announced that it was phasing out the brand. In 1998, what remained of the Allis-Chalmers manufacturing businesses were divested, and in January 1999, the company officially closed its Milwaukee offices. The remaining service businesses became Allis-Chalmers Energy in Houston, Texas. =Brand reuse, 2000 to present= In August 2008, Briggs & Stratton announced that it would sell lawn tractors under the Allis-Chalmers brand name.Business Journal of Milwaukee, Thursday, August 21, 2008 Former sites Allis-Chalmers engine block * Corporate offices, Milwaukee, Wisconsin * Tractor plant, West Allis, Wisconsin * Gleaner combine plant, Independence, Missouri (site inherited from Gleaner Manufacturing Company) * Tractor plant, La Porte, Indiana (site inherited from Advance-Rumely) * Implement plant, La Crosse, Wisconsin (site inherited from La Crosse Plow Works) * Tractor plant, Gadsden, Alabama * Heavy equipment plant in Springfield, Illinois (site inherited from the Monarch Tractor Company acquisition) * Heavy equipment plant in Deerfield, Illinois (site inherited from the Tractomotive Corporation acquisition) * Tractor plant in Cedar Rapids, Iowa * Various parts factories in Chicago * Others Agricultural machinery Allis-Chalmers offered a complete line of agricultural machinery, from tillage and harvesting to tractors. =Tractor models= In 1959, a team led by Harry Ihrig built a 15 kW fuel cell tractor for Allis-Chalmers which was demonstrated across the US at state fairs. This was the first fuel-cell-powered vehicle. Potassium hydroxide served as the electrolyte. The original AC fuel cell tractor is currently on display at the Smithsonian. =Balers= Allis-Chalmers Roto Baler The first model introduced in 1949 was called the \\"Roto-Baler\\" and the fore-runner of modern round balers, albeit with much smaller bales. The Roto-Baler was built until the 1960s or 1970s. Allis Chalmers also built many small square baler models. =Tractor parts= While AGCO is now the parts manufacturer for most of the parts one would need to fix up their older Allis-Chalmers tractors, including water pumps to oil filters, and even rebuild kits and tractor manuals, aftermarket suppliers offer parts that AGCO does not. Industrial and power house equipment An Allis-Chalmers electric generator Allis Chalmers marketed a full line of Industrial and Power House equipment, including turbo generators and medium voltage switchgear. In the 1920s through the 1960s AC Power House and Industrial equipment was competitive with industry giants like General Electric and Westinghouse. As early as the 1920s AC was manufacturing multi MVA hydro-electric generators and turbines, many of which remain in service today (Louisville Gas & Electric Ohio Falls units 1‚Äì8, 8MW low head turbines and Kentucky Utilities Dix Dam units 1‚Äì3, 11MVA 300 RPM generators). Allis Chalmers manufactured several lines of medium voltage switchgear, such as the HF and MA lines. The HF line competed with the General Electric \\"AM\\" Magneblast line of vertical-lift medium-voltage switchgear. The MA line was a competitor of the ITE \\"HK\\" line of horizontal-racking medium-voltage switchgear. Allis-Chalmers produced a line of substation transformers, voltage regulators, and distribution transformers. Allis Chalmers, during the period 1930‚Äì1965 and beyond, manufactured and marketed an extensive line of ore crushing equipment for the mining industryBond, Fred C., It Happened to Me, 1975, Ch. 68‚Äì139; In 1965, Allis-Chalmers built \\"Big Allis,\\" or Ravenswood No. 3, the biggest generator in New York.

It is an electronic resource that comprises molecular and biochemical information on enzymes that have been classified by the IUBMB. Every classified enzyme is characterized with respect to its catalyzed biochemical reaction. Kinetic properties of the corresponding reactants (that is, substrates and products) are described in detail. BRENDA contains enzyme-specific data manually extracted from primary scientific literature and additional data derived from automatic information retrieval methods such as text mining. It provides a web-based user interface that allows a convenient and sophisticated access to the data. History BRENDA was founded in 1987 at the former German Research Centre for Biotechnology (now the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research) in Braunschweig and was originally published as a series of books. Its name was originally an acronym for the Braunschweig Enzyme Database. From 1996 to 2007, BRENDA was located at the University of Cologne. There, BRENDA developed into a publicly accessible enzyme information system. In 2007, BRENDA returned to Braunschweig. Currently, BRENDA is maintained and further developed at the Department of Bioinformatics and Biochemistry at the TU Braunschweig. Updates A major update of the data in BRENDA is performed twice a year. Besides the upgrade of its content, improvements of the user interface are also incorporated into the BRENDA database.  Content and features  Database: The database contains more than 40 data fields with enzyme-specific information on more than 7000 EC numbers that are classified according to the IUBMB. The different data fields cover information on the enzyme's nomenclature, reaction and specificity, enzyme structure, isolation and preparation, enzyme stability, kinetic parameters such as Km value and turnover number, occurrence and localization, mutants and engineered enzymes, application of enzymes and ligand-related data. Currently, BRENDA contains manually annotated data from over 140,000 different scientific articles. Each enzyme entry is clearly linked to at least one literature reference, to its source organism, and, where available, to the protein sequence of the enzyme. An important part of BRENDA represent the more than 110,000 enzyme ligands, which are available on their names, synonyms or via the chemical structure. The term \\"ligand\\" is used in this context to all low molecular weight compounds which interact with enzymes. These include not only metabolites of primary metabolism, co-substrates or cofactors but also enzyme inhibitors or metal ions. The origin of these molecules ranges from naturally occurring antibiotics to synthetic compounds that have been synthesized for the development of drugs or pesticides. Furthermore, cross-references to external information resources such as sequence and 3D-structure databases, as well as biomedical ontologies, are provided. Extensions: Since 2006, the data in BRENDA is supplemented with information extracted from the scientific literature by a co-occurrence based text mining approach. For this purpose, four text-mining repositories FRENDA (Full Reference ENzyme DAta), AMENDA (Automatic Mining of ENzyme DAta), DRENDA (Disease-Related ENzyme information DAtabase) and KENDA (Kinetic ENzyme DAta) were introduced. These text-mining results were derived from the titles and abstracts of all articles in the literature database PubMed.Schomburg I, Chang A, Placzek S, S√∂hngen C, Rother M, Lang M, Munaretto C, Ulas S, Stelzer M, Grote A, Scheer M, Schomburg D: \\"BRENDA in 2013: integrated reactions, kinetic data, enzyme function data, improved disease classification: new options and contents in BRENDA\\", Nucleic Acids Res., 41 (Database issue): D764-D772 Data access: There are several tools to obtain access to the data in BRENDA.

Known for his devotion to French culture and musical thought, Jolivet drew on his interest in acoustics and atonality, as well as both ancient and modern musical influences, particularly on instruments used in ancient times. He composed in a wide variety of forms for many different types of ensembles. Life Plaque at 59 Rue de Varenne, Paris, commemorating Andr√© Jolivet Andr√© Jolivet was born on 8 August 1905, at rue Versigny in Montmartre, Paris, the son of Victor-Ernest Jolivet and Madeleine Perault; his father an artist, his mother a pianist. Jolivet developed an interest in the arts early in his life, taking up painting and cello lessons at the age of 14. However, he was encouraged by his parents to become a teacher, going to teachers' college and teaching primary school in Paris (taking three years in between to serve in the military). One of his own teachers, however, believed Jolivet had a future in music, strongly encouraged him to pursue composition, and introduced him to Paul Le Flem, Jolivet's first teacher in composition. Le Flem gave Jolivet a firm grounding in classical forms of harmony and counterpoint. After hearing his first concert of Arnold Schoenberg, Jolivet became interested in atonal music, and then on Le Flem's recommendation became the only European student of Edgard Var√®se, who passed on his knowledge of musical acoustics, atonal music, sound masses, and orchestration. In 1936 Jolivet co-founded the group La jeune France along with composers Olivier Messiaen, Daniel-Lesur, and Yves Baudrier, who were attempting to re-establish a more human and less abstract form of composition. La jeune France developed from the avant-garde chamber music society La Spirale, formed by Jolivet, Messiaen, and Lesur the previous year. =Private life= Jolivet married twice, firstly violinist Martine BarbillionDuchesneau, M.

Flammarion, Paris. and they had three children, Pierre-Alain (1935‚Äì2005), Christine (b. 1940), and Merri (b. 1943).Rae, C. (2006): \\"Jolivet on Jolivet. An Interview with the Composer's Daughter\\", in: The Musical Times, Spring 2006. =Death= Jolivet's grave next to that of Henri Sauguet Jolivet died in Paris in 1974 aged 69, leaving unfinished his opera Le Soldat inconnu. He was buried at Montmartre Cemetery next to the composer Henri Sauguet (Section 27, near the grave of Hector Berlioz). Career Jolivet's aesthetic ideals underwent many changes throughout his career. His initial desire as an adolescent was to write music for the theater, which inspired his first compositions, including music for a ballet. Claude Debussy, Paul Dukas, and Maurice Ravel were to be his next influences after he heard a concert of their work in 1919; he composed several piano pieces while training to become a teacher before going to study with Le Flem. Schoenberg and Var√®se were strongly evident in his first period of maturity as a composer, during which his style drew heavily upon atonality and modernistic ideas. Mana (1933), the beginning of his \\"magic period\\", was a work in six parts for piano, with each part named after one of the six objects Var√®se left with him before moving to the United States. Jolivet's intent as a composer throughout his career was to \\"give back to music its original, ancient meaning, when it was the magical, incantatory expression of the religious beliefs of human groups.\\" Mana, even as one of his first mature works, is a reflection of this; Jolivet considered the sculptures as fetish objects. His later writing continued to seek the original meanings of music and its capacity for emotional, ritual, and celebratory expression. In 1945 he published a paper declaring that \\"true French music owes nothing to Stravinsky\\", though both composers drew heavily upon themes of ancient music in their work; Jolivet and La jeune France rejected neoclassicism in favor of a less mechanical and progressive and instead a more spiritual style of composition. Later, during World War II, Jolivet shifted away from atonality and toward a more tonal and lyrical style of composition. After a few years of working in this more simplistic style, during which time he wrote the comic opera Dolor√®s, ou Le miracle de la femme laide (1942) and the ballet Guignol et Pandore (1943), he arrived at a compromise between this and his earlier more experimental work. The First Piano Sonata, written in 1945, shows elements of both these styles. Finally realizing his youthful ambition to write for the theater, Jolivet became the musical director of the Com√©die Fran√ßaise in 1945, a post he held until 1959. While there he composed for plays by Moli√®re, Racine, Sophocles, Shakespeare, and Claudel, scoring 14 works in total. He also continued to compose for the concert hall, often inspired by his frequent travels around the world, adapting texts and music from Egypt, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia into his distinctly French style. During the 1950s and 1960s, Jolivet wrote several concertos for a variety of instruments including trumpet, piano, flute, harp, bassoon, percussion, cello, and violin. These works, while highly regarded, all demand virtuosic technical skill from the performers. Jolivet is also one of the few composers to write for the ondes Martenot, an early electronic instrument, completing a concerto for it in 1947, 19 years after the instrument's invention. Jolivet founded the Centre Fran√ßais d'Humanisme Musical at Aix-en-Provence in 1959, and in 1961 went to teach composition at the Paris Conservatoire.

It was constructed in the early 21st century on the site of what had once been HM Gunwharf, Portsmouth. This was one of several such facilities which were established around Britain and the Empire by the Board of Ordnance, where cannons, ammunition and other armaments were stored, repaired and serviced ready for use on land or at sea. Later known as HMS Vernon, the military site closed in 1995, and opened to the public as Gunwharf Quays after six years of reconstruction (which included the restoration of some of the surviving 18th and 19th-century Gun Wharf buildings). The landmark Spinnaker Tower, which also stands on the site, was opened a few years later.  History Map of 1773 showing the Gun Wharf jutting into the harbour, just north of the entrance to the Mill Pond Central section of the Grand Storehouse Gunwharf Quays viewed from the water An Ordnance Yard (the Old Gun Wharf) was established on land reclaimed from the sea to the north of the old Mill Pond (which survives today as the canal) in 1706. The site was extended by reclaiming further land from the sea to the south of the old Mill Pond to create the New Gun Wharf in circa 1800. The Grand Storehouse (built as part the New Gun Wharf and now known as the Vulcan Building) was completed in 1814. A wide range of ordnance-related equipment had to be accommodated within the Yard. Gun carriages in particular took up a lot of space, and were prone to decay if left outside. Cannons and cannonballs, on the other hand, could be stored in the open air without too much damage being done, as described here in 1817: > Every ship in ordinary has on the wharf her guns, placed in regular rows, > each ship's guns by themselves, with the name of the ship they belong to, > painted in capital letters on the first gun of each parcel. The balls are > formed in pyramids from 42 pounders to the lowest bores, every size in a > pyramid by themselves; the bomb shells are also placed in the same regular > order. In 1824 a set of storehouses along the southern edge of the site were converted to form barracks for the Royal Marine Artillery (the first time that this section of the Corps had been provided with its own separate barracks). In 1858 the Royal Marine Artillery moved out (first to Fort Cumberland, then to the new purpose-built Eastney Barracks). The Grand Storehouse was mirrored by a similarly sizeable \\"Sea Service Store\\" on the Old Gun Wharf (later remodelled to serve as the Warrior naval accommodation block). In addition to these two, a plan dated 1859 indicates more than a dozen other large storehouses all around the site. As ships and armaments developed, the requirement to offload the armament diminished, and the Gunwharf fell into disuse. It re-established as the Royal Navy shore establishment HMS Vernon in 1923. The site became HMS Nelson in 1986 and ceased operations in 1995. The site was then sold to Berkeley Group Holdings in 1996 and, after being redeveloped to a design by HGP Architects, re-opened as a retail outlet in February 2001. =Retained historic buildings and structures= HMS Vernon suffered extensive damage during the Blitz, but a number of historic structures survived, some of which have been restored as part of the Gunwharf Quays development. * The Old Customs House pub and restaurant, built as an administration block in the late 18th century, is the oldest building on the site and the only significant survival on the Old Gun Wharf side. * An early 19th-century gateway stands behind the Vulcan building, indicating the line of the original boundary of the New Gun Wharf; Initially hemmed in by the fortifications of Old Portsmouth, the site expanded further when the town fortifications were levelled in the 1870s; much of the later perimeter wall, which dates from this expansion, remains in place around the edge of the site, along with the Main Gate of c.1870. * The Grand Storehouse (later called the Vulcan Building) was the principal structure on the New Gun Wharf, built 1811-14. Its north wing and clock tower were both destroyed in the Blitz and only reinstated as part of the Gunwharf Quays reconstruction. * The old Royal Marines Infirmary building was originally built as an Ordnance Storehouse at around the same time as the Vulcan block; together with other nearby storehouses it was converted to form Gunwharf Barracks, of which it is the only surviving part. * Behind the Vulcan building, and dwarfed by it, is a former shell store (Building No. 25) dating from 1856.

Prior to that, he was the head coach at Virginia Commonwealth University from 2006 to 2009, and at the University of Alabama from 2009 to 2015. Prior to becoming the VCU head coach, he was an assistant coach at the University of Florida from 1996 to 2006. Biography =Early life= After graduating from Miami Senior High School, Grant became an All-City first-team selection and Player-of-the- Year. He played at the University of Dayton from 1983 to 1987 while residing at 3 Evanston (The Gateway) and guiding them to the Elite Eight of the NCAA Tournament before bowing out to eventual national champion Georgetown. As a sophomore, Grant averaged 10.7 points a game and 6.5 rebounds a game and the Flyers again made it to the NCAA Tournament. As a junior, the 6'5\\" Grant moved from power forward to small forward and averaged 7.1 points a game and 4.8 rebounds a contest while the team advanced to the National Invitation Tournament. As a senior, Grant was named a team captain, was awarded team MVP, and won the Sharpenter Memorial Rebounding Award after leading the squad in scoring and rebounding, averaging 13.0 and 6.0 respectively. In his 105 appearances, Grant averaged 11.6 points and 6.7 rebounds. In 1987, Grant spent a year playing for the Miami Tropics of the United States Basketball League. In 1987, Grant became an assistant coach and math teacher at Miami Senior High School under Marcos \\"Shaky\\" Rodriguez. =Coaching career= Assistant coach The Miami native served for ten years as an assistant to Billy Donovan at the University of Florida (UF). The 1999 and 2000 teams made the first back-to-back Sweet 16 appearances in school history and the 2000 squad made UF's first appearance in the National Championship game, where they lost to Michigan State. In the spring of 2002, Grant was elevated to the title of Associate Head Coach after serving as an assistant for his first six seasons. Grant played a key role in helping the Gators to the 2006 NCAA title, the 2005 and 2006 Southeastern Conference Tournament titles, three SEC Eastern Division titles and back-to-back SEC Championships in 2000 and 2001. The Gators have reached eight straight NCAA Tournaments, capped by the national title in 2006 in which Florida became the first team since the 1968 UCLA Bruins to win both the national semifinal and the final by at least 15 points. The Gators were 226‚Äì98 (.698) during Grant's 10-year stint in Gainesville. Prior to the University of Florida, Grant served as an assistant to Donovan for two years at Marshall University helping them to a 35‚Äì20 record. Grant also served as an assistant coach during the 1993‚Äì94 season at Stetson. Virginia Commonwealth Grant led VCU to a 79‚Äì77 upset of 6th seeded Duke to reach the 2nd round of the 2007 NCAA Tournament. Two of Grant's VCU players were drafted as first round draft picks in the 2009 (Eric Maynor) and 2010 NBA drafts (Larry Sanders). Alabama Grant in 2012 On March 27, 2009 Grant agreed in principle to become the twentieth head men's basketball coach at the University of Alabama. In Grant's first season at Alabama, the Crimson Tide went 17‚Äì15 (6‚Äì10), winning their last two regular season games to clinch a winning record and the 4th seed in the west in the 2010 SEC Men's Basketball Tournament. They would go on to lose in the quarterfinals to #2 Kentucky. In his second season at the Capstone, Grant's young team struggled early in the season, going 8‚Äì6 during non-conference play, but bounced back, going 12‚Äì4 in SEC play, to win the SEC Western Division title. Grant also got his first \\"signature\\" win, when Alabama defeated #12 Kentucky in Coleman Coliseum, 68‚Äì66. Dick Vitale has noted Grant as one of his \\"Coaches on the Rise\\". He guided Alabama to the NIT Final in Madison Square Garden in only his second year. Grant reached the 2012 NCAA Tournament in his third season. That marked Alabama's first appearance since 2006. However, it was short-lived; the Tide lost to Creighton in the opening round of the tournament. In Grant's fourth season at Alabama, the Crimson Tide started strong but struggled in December due to injuries. The Tide finished a surprising 12‚Äì6 in SEC play, tied for 2nd place in the league. After winning one game in the SEC Basketball Tournament, the Tide lost to Florida the next day, 61‚Äì51. Grant's team lost to Miami in the National Invitation Tournament quarterfinals by a score of 58‚Äì57. On March 15, 2015, Grant was fired from Alabama. NBA On June 29, 2015, Grant was hired by the Oklahoma City Thunder to be an assistant coach under coach Billy Donovan. Dayton On March 30, 2017, the University of Dayton announced that Grant would be the program's new head coach after the departure of Archie Miller to Indiana University.https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/atlantic10/2017/03/30/anthony- grant-dayton-basketball-coach/99822000/ For the 2019‚Äì20 season, Grant was named the Sporting News National Coach of the Year.

History The hospital was established with surplus funds arising from disbandment of the Scottish Women's Hospitals for Foreign Service, an organisation which had been formed by Elsie Inglis and which had sent hospital units to France, Serbia, Russia, Corsica and Greece during the First World War. The 20-bed hospital opened in July 1925. The hospital joined the National Health Service in 1948 and was directly managed by the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. After services transferred to the Eastern General Hospital, despite public protests about the proposed closure, the facility closed in 1988. Following assurances that another maternity unit in the city would be named after Inglis, one journalist suggested renaming the Royal Hospital for Children and Young People after her. The original maternity facility subsequently re-opened as a private nursing home and nursery, but following an investigation into the death of a 59-year-old woman, it closed again in 2011. The building was converted and the site is now occupied by residential properties.

Rectangles A, on the left, look much darker than the rectangles B, on the right. However, rectangles A and B reflect the same amount of light. White's illusion is a brightness illusion where certain stripes of a black and white grating is partially replaced by a gray rectangle (Fig. 1). Both of the gray bars of A and B are the same color and opacity. The brightness of the gray pieces appear to shift toward the brightness of the top and bottom bordering stripes. This is in apparent opposition to lateral inhibition as it cannot explain this occurrence. This occurs even when the gray patches in the black stripes are bordered by more white than black (and conversely for the gray patches in the white stripes). A similar illusion occurs when the horizontal strips have different colors; this is known as Munker‚ÄìWhite's illusion or Munker's illusion. Lateral inhibition The amount of each bipolar cell response depends on the amount of the stimulation it receives from the receptor and the amount that this response is decreased by the lateral inhibition it receives from its neighboring cells.Sensation and perception, E. Bruce Goldstein, Edition 8, illustrated, Publisher Cengage Learning, 2009 Lateral inhibition cannot explain White's illusion. In Figure 2.1 lateral inhibition sent by black cells A and C should make cell O lighter; in Figure 2.2 lateral inhibition sent by white cells A and C should make cell O darker. It is suggested that brightness induction follows the brightness contrast in the direction of the bar not the surrounding area. =Lateral inhibition explained= Figure 2. In Figure 2.1 we assume that light dropping on cells B and D generates a response of 100 units. Since the points A and C are darker we assume that only 20 units are generated from these points. Another assumption is that the lateral inhibition sent by each cell is 10% of its response; cells B and D send an inhibition of 10 units each and cells A and C send an inhibition of 2 units each. The inhibition sent by cells A and C is larger since their size is bigger than the size of cells B and D (let's say 2 times). This concludes that cell O receives an inhibition In Figure 2.2 with the same assumptions as above stated, cell O receives an inhibition of I = 10 √ó 2 + 10 √ó 2 + 2 + 2 = 44. Because point O in Figure 2.1 receives an inhibition smaller than the point O in Figure 2.2 the gray cell should be lighter. =Experiments on lateral inhibition= White and White (1985) concluded that at a higher spatial frequency the grating of White's illusion could be described by brightness assimilation. They also concluded that at lower spatial frequencies White's illusion is still present. Blakeslee and McCourt (2004) suggested that patterns whose scales are larger compared to the encoding filters (low spatial frequency) are represented with a loss of low frequency information exhibiting brightness contrast; patterns whose scales are smaller compared to encoding filters (high spatial frequency), are represented with a loss of high frequency information exhibiting brightness assimilation. Belongingness Our perception of an area's lightness is influenced by the part of the surroundings to which the area appears to belong. A disc example consists of four discs on the left which are identical to four discs on the right in terms of how much light is reflected from the discs, that is to say, they are physically identical. The theory to explain the different psychological experiences is called belongingness. The discs on the left appear dark and the ones on the right appear light, this is because of the two displays. In the display on the left, the dark area on the left seemingly belongs to the discs, and the discs are obscured by the light mist. On the right side, the same dark areas are interpreted as belonging to the dark mist. In the meanwhile, the white parts are seen as the color of the discs. Therefore, our perception of the lightness of the discs is significantly influenced by the display, which is the mist in this case (Anderson & Winawer, 2005). The belongingness theory has been suggested as an explanation of White's illusion. According to belongingness theory, the lightness of rectangle A is influenced by the white display, which should be the white bars that surround it. Similarly, the rectangle B on the right side is surrounded by the dark bars, and the lightness of rectangle B is affected by the dark background. As a result, area A which rests on the white background appears darker than area B which rests on the dark background. Belongingness theory only explains why rectangle A looks darker than rectangle B and does not discuss why the gray area on rectangle A looks darker than in rectangle B; secondly, when talking about the background, Belongingness theory appears quite the same as simultaneous contrast theory, they just use different names. Kelly and Grossberg (2000, P&P;, 62, 1596-1619) explain and simulate these perceived differences and various other surface brightness and figure-ground percepts, such as those arising from Bregman-Kanizsa, Benary cross, and checkerboard displays, using the FACADE theory of 3-D vision and figure-ground perception.

Wet electrons are attracted to positively charged hydroxide ions which form on oxide surfaces in the presence of atmospheric moisture. These electrons in turn affect the interaction of other materials with the oxide. Hydrogen atoms on water or hydroxide (OH) can be involved in hydrogen bonds or be dangling. Wet electrons are primarily stabilized by the dangling atoms on OH, which is more acidic than water, but the dangling atoms on water also contribute to the stabilization. The process is akin to following the lowest elevation path between valleys with a mountain between them. The minimum energy necessary to change an electron from the solid to the liquid state corresponds to going through the wet electron state.

Leybourne popularised the song which premi√®red in August 1866 at the Princess' Concert Hall in Leeds. For the act, he caused some controversy when he appeared in a cut down top hat, similar to a style worn by the murderer Franz Muller. It was one of Leybourne's most famous songs and he would later be nicknamed Champagne Charlie. Leybourne's rival Alfred Vance introduced a number called \\"Cliquot\\", starting a fierce competition between the two men. Enthusiasm for the song was increased with its use in November 1866 in the new \\"Operatic Burlesque\\" called \\"The Latest Edition of Black-Eyed Susan\\", or \\"The Little Bill that was Taken Up\\". The song was sung by the crowd at the public execution of Michael Barrett in 1868, the last public execution in Great Britain. It later featured in the play Champagne Charlie and, with changed lyrics, the 1944 film Champagne Charlie featuring Tommy Trinder and Stanley Holloway. It is also heard as a background song a few times in the Jack the Ripper (1988) television movie starring Michael Caine. It is sung by Miriam Hopkins in the 1931 version of Dr. Jekyll and Mr.Hyde but with the refrain \\"Champagne Ivy is my name.\\" A substantially revised version of \\"Champagne Charlie\\" was recorded in 1932 by the American blues singer Blind Blake. Blind Blake's version was later covered by the jazz musician Leon Redbone on his album of the same name in 1978.

He played as a catcher in Major League Baseball from through . A six- time All-Star, Bailey was one of the top catchers in the National League in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Born in Strawberry Plains in Jefferson County, Tennessee, Bailey batted left-handed, threw right-handed and was listed as tall and . A younger brother, Jim, was a left-handed pitcher who had a brief big-league trial as Ed's teammate on the 1959 Cincinnati Reds. Major League career Ed Bailey signed with the Reds in 1950 as an amateur free agent. He reached the Majors in 1953 and in 1955 he was given a chance as the Redlegs' (the Cincinnati team's nickname from 1953‚Äì58) starting catcher, replacing Andy Seminick. When his offensive production floundered, the Redlegs traded Seminick for catcher Smoky Burgess and Bailey was sent down to the San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League. With the help of some batting advice from Redlegs manager and former catcher Birdie Tebbetts, his hitting improved in the minor leagues and continued to improve in the Venezuelan Winter League. Bailey began the 1956 season as the backup catcher to Burgess, but when the team faltered early in the season, Tebbetts decided to shake things up and named Bailey as the Redlegs' starting catcher. By mid-season, he was the leading hitter in the National League with a .335 batting average, helping to spur the Redlegs into first place. His hitting performance earned him a place as the starting catcher for the National League in the 1956 All-Star Game. The Redlegs stayed in the pennant race until the last day of the season, ending up with a 91‚Äì63 record, two games behind the Brooklyn Dodgers. Bailey ended the 1956 season with career-highs in batting average (.300), home runs (28), runs batted in (75), and led the league in baserunners caught stealing (23). Bailey in 1961 In 1957, the Redlegs were once again in first place at mid-season, but faltered to finish the season in fourth place. Bailey earned his second consecutive start for the National League All-Star Team, led National League catchers with a 46.2 Caught Stealing percentage and finished second to Roy Campanella with a .992 fielding percentage. He remained as the Reds' starting catcher for the rest of the 1950s up until 12 games into the 1961 season, when he was traded to the San Francisco Giants for second baseman Don Blasingame and catcher Bob Schmidt. In 1962, Bailey platooned with catcher Tom Haller, as the two players‚Äîboth left-handed hitters‚Äîcombined to give the Giants 35 home runs and 100 runs batted in from the catcher's position. In June of that year, Bailey had a streak of 3 clutch home runs in four games that propelled the Giants into first place. The Giants battled the Los Angeles Dodgers in a tight pennant race as the two teams ended the season tied for first place and met in the 1962 National League tie-breaker series. The Giants won the three-game series to clinch the National League championship. Bailey appeared in six games of the 1962 World Series, hitting a home run in Game 3 as the Giants lost to the New York Yankees in seven games. He had another strong year in 1963, hitting 21 home runs with 68 runs batted in, earning his fifth and final All-Star berth. In December 1963, Bailey was traded along with Felipe Alou and Billy Hoeft to the Milwaukee Braves for Del Crandall, Bob Hendley and Bob Shaw. He served as Joe Torre's back up for two seasons with the Braves before being traded back to the Giants in February 1965. After just fourteen games of the 1965 season, he was traded again, this time to the Chicago Cubs, where he served as a backup catcher to Vic Roznovsky. On July 22, 1965, Bailey hit a grand slam home run, a three-run home run and a run-scoring single to drive home eight runs during a game against the Philadelphia Phillies. After the season, he was traded to the California Angels and was released after appearing in only five games of the 1966 season. Career statistics In a fourteen-season major league career, Bailey played in 1,212 games with 915 hits in 3,581 at bats for a .256 batting average along with 155 home runs and 540 runs batted in, including 423 runs, a .355 on-base percentage and a .986 fielding percentage. He was a five-time All-Star and led National League catchers in baserunners caught stealing and caught stealing percentage once each. At the time of his retirement, he ranked 11th overall for career home runs by a catcher. His younger brother, pitcher Jim Bailey, also played in the Major Leagues. When his brother joined the Reds in 1959, the Bailey brothers became one of the few brother-batteries in Major League history. In between, Bailey guided both the L√°cteos de Pastora and Industriales de Valencia to Venezuela League championship titles,Guti√©rrez, Daniel; Alvarez, Efraim; Guti√©rrez (h), Daniel (2006).

Factual texts merely seek to inform, whereas literary texts seek to entertain or otherwise engage the reader by using creative language and imagery. There are many aspects to literary writing, and many ways to analyse it, but four basic categories are descriptive, narrative, expository, and argumentative. Narrative text type Based on perception in time. Narration is the telling of a story; the succession of events is given in chronological order. ;Purpose The basic purpose of narrative is to entertain, to gain and hold readers' interest. However narratives can also be written to teach or inform, to change attitudes / social opinions e.g. soap operas and television dramas that are used to raise topical issues. Narratives sequence people/characters in time and place but differ from recounts in that through the sequencing, the stories set up one or more problems, which must eventually find a way to be resolved. The common structure or basic plan of narrative text is known as the \\"story grammar\\". Although there are numerous variations of the story grammar, the typical elements are: * Settings ‚Äî when and where the story occurs. * Characters‚Äî the most important people or characters in the story. * Initiating event ‚Äî an action or occurrence that establishes a problem and/or goal. * Conflicts/goal ‚Äî the focal point around which the whole story is organized. * Events ‚Äî one or more attempts by the main character(s) to achieve the goal or solve the problem. * Resolutions ‚Äî the outcome of the attempts to achieve the goal The graphic representation of these story grammar elements is called a story map. The exact form and complexity of a map depends, of course, upon the unique structure of each narrative and the personal preference of the teacher constructing the map. ;Types There are many types of narrative. They can be imaginary, factual or a combination of both. They may include fairy stories, mysteries, science fiction, romances, horror stories, adventure stories, fables, myths and legends, historical narratives, ballads, slice of life, personal experience. Features: * Characters with defined personalities/identities. * Dialogue often included - tense may change to the present or the future. * Descriptive language to create images in the reader's mind and enhance the story. ;Structure In a Traditional Narrative the focus of the text is on a series of actions: :;Orientation: (Introduction) in which the characters, setting, and time of the story are established. Usually answers who? When? Where? E.g. Mr. Wolf went out hunting in the forest one dark gloomy night. :;Complication or problem: The complication usually involves the main character(s) (often mirroring the complications in real life). :;Resolution: There needs to be a resolution of the complication. The complication may be resolved for better or worse/happily or unhappily. Sometimes there are a number of complications that have to be resolved. These add and sustain interest and suspense for the reader. Further more, when there is plan for writing narrative texts, the focus should be on the following characteristics: *Plot: What is going to happen? *Setting: Where will the story take place? When will the story take place? *Characterization: Who are the main characters? What do they look like? *Structure: How will the story begin? What will be the problem? How is the problem going to be resolved? *Theme: What is the theme / message the writer is attempting to communicate? Expository text type It aims at explanation, i.e. the cognitive analysis and subsequent syntheses of complex facts. Example: An essay on \\"Rhetoric: What is it and why do we study it?\\" There is a chance that your work may fall flat if you have not chosen one of the really good expository essay topics. Not all topics out there are interesting or meaty enough to be thoroughly investigated within a paper. Make sure you put effort into choosing a topic that has a lot of material to cover it and pique the interest of readers! * Trending Topics: Are there any hot issues that deserve some deep discussion? If so, consider educating people on this seemingly new occurrence through the use of a well- written essay. ** \`Example: Cultural and Historical Shifts.\` * A topic close to your heart: It is easy much easier to defend a thesis if you find yourself passionately thinking about the topic. If you have an advocacy and want to inform others, choose this path and you might be able to sway beliefs! Comparing the past and the present is a good way of framing an argument, especially if a lot has been written about it. Argumentative text type Based on the evaluation and the subsequent subjective judgement in answer to a problem. It refers to the reasons advanced for or against a matter. The writer usually argues with another side to convince the reader to join a certain side. Literature A literary text is a piece of writing, such as a book or poem, that has the purpose of telling a story or entertaining, as in a fictional novel. Its primary function as a text is usually aesthetic, but it may also contain political messages or beliefs. American schoolchildren and their parents are taught that literary texts contrast with informational texts that have the purpose of providing information rather than entertainment. Informational texts, such as science briefs and history books, are increasingly receiving emphasis in public school curricula as part of the Common Core State Standards. As a result, many parents have challenged the idea that literary texts are of less pedagogical value than informational ones.

Common sites for pannus formation include over the cornea, over a joint surface (as seen in rheumatoid arthritis), or on a prosthetic heart valve.Farlex Partner Medical Dictionary ¬© Farlex 2012 Pannus may grow in a tumor-like fashion, as in joints where it may erode articular cartilage and bone. In common usage, the term pannus is often used to refer to a panniculus (a hanging flap of tissue).  Pannus in rheumatoid arthritis  The term \\"pannus\\" is derived from the Latin for \\"tablecloth\\". Inflammation and exuberant proliferation of the synovium leads to formation of pannus and destruction of cartilage, bone, tendons, ligaments, and blood vessels. Basically, the hypertrophied synovium is called pannus. Pannus tissue is composed of aggressive macrophage- and fibroblast-like mesenchymal cells, macrophage-like cells and other inflammatory cells that release collagenolytic enzymes. In people suffering from rheumatoid arthritis, pannus tissue eventually forms in the joint affected by the disease, causing loss of bone and cartilage. From Autoimmunity and Disease by Harley Y. Tse and Michail K. Shaw:  Pannus in ophthalmology  In ophthalmology, pannus refers to the growth of blood vessels into the peripheral cornea. In normal individuals, the cornea is avascular. Chronic local hypoxia (such as that occurring with overuse of contact lenses) or inflammation may lead to peripheral corneal vascularization, or pannus. Pannus may also develop in diseases of the corneal stem cells, such as aniridia. It is often resolved by peritomy.

Dag Gundersen: Knud Knudsen ‚Äì spr√•kmann (Store norske leksikon) Biography Knud Knudsen was born at Tvedestrand in Aust-Agder, Norway. He was first Adjunct Professor in Drammen until 1846, when he was appointed headmaster at the Christiania Cathedral School, a position he held until 1880. Knud Knudsen, Forkjemper for riksm√•let, aka bokm√•let (Tangient LLC) Knudsen became involved in the development of the national debate which resulted in the Riksm√•l (later Bokm√•l) and Landsm√•l forms of the written Norwegian language. As an educator, he had observed that students had difficulty writing in the Danish language, when they spoke the Norwegian language. He came to believe that the written language should be changed to match common speech. In this regard, Knudsen came to exercise influence among his contemporaries, including Bj√∏rnstjerne Bj√∏rnson.Knud Knudsen ‚Äì riksm√•lets fader, bokm√•lets bestefar (Spr√•kr√•det)Det dansknorske m√•lstr√¶v (Siri-Mari, norsk bloggen)Metode:Lokal spr√•kstrid (lokalhistoriewiki.no) Knudsen was one of the first to propose Norwegianization (fornorskninglinjen), the rewriting of loanwords into a Norwegian spelling (e.g. turning chauffeur into sj√•f√∏r). His aim was to give a more Norwegian coloring to the literary language of Norway by adapting the orthography and syntax to Norwegian usage, and by substituting wherever it was possible, Norwegian words for foreign derivatives. He wanted changes that could occur in the shortest time possible and consequently put forward several reforms working within the Danish written language.

His father, Brad Evans, was a National Review journalist and his mother, Paula, a painter. His younger sister is American actress Gretchen Egolf. His younger half-brother is American/British musician Siegfried Faith-Evans. As a Roman Catholic, his godparents were Leo Brent Bozell II and Patricia Lee Buckley. His parents divorced in Egolf's childhood and he took the surname of his stepfather, Gary Egolf. It was life in Philadelphia, however, that inspired Egolf, along with summer visits to his father's new home in Indiana. He graduated from Hempfield High School in Landisville, Pennsylvania, in 1990. Egolf briefly attended Temple University, in Philadelphia.  Music career  Egolf dropped out of Temple and joined a punk rock band \\"Freak Thing\\", later \\"Kitschchao\\". The band did release one 7\\" single on Compulsiv Records, but after the band was dissolved Egolf wanted to focus on his writing and moved to Paris, which he said was the best place to write about Kentucky, where Lord of the Barnyard was to be set. For 18 months, he wrote during the day and subsidized his rent by playing guitar in Irish bars and on the Pont des Arts as a street musician.  Literary career  In Paris, Egolf struck up an acquaintance with Marie Modiano. Her father Patrick Modiano, French author and screenwriter (Lacombe Lucien) and winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature, helped Egolf get his first novel published in France in 1998 by Gallimard after it had been rejected by more than 70 U.S. publishers. Lord of the Barnyard was subsequently published in the United Kingdom and the United States and received moderately favorable reviews ‚Äì with a few raves worldwide. His second book, Skirt and the Fiddle, was published in 2002 to even better critical response; his third, Kornwolf, was published after his death. He had also been working on a screenplay for Lord of the Barnyard, left unfinished.  Political activism  Outside his writing, Egolf achieved some renown as a political activist. In July 2004, he and a group of friends, later known as the Smoketown Six, were arrested outside Lancaster, Pennsylvania, for stripping down to thong underwear and piling on top of one another alongside a road that was being traveled by US President George W. Bush to protest the Abu Ghraib prison-abuse scandal.

Located 90 kilometres south of the Namibian capital Windhoek, Rehoboth lies on a high elevation plateau with several natural hot-water springs. It receives sparse mean annual rainfall of , although in the 2010/2011 a record were measured. In 2005, it had a population of 21,378 later increased to 28,843 in 2011, according to the 2011 Namibian Population and Housing Census. Rehoboth is intersected from north to south by the national road B1, which also serves as the border of the two electoral constituencies in the town, Rehoboth Urban West and Rehoboth Urban East. Rehoboth is the core territory of the Baster community which still lives according to their Paternal Laws which were enacted in 1872.  Administration  Rehoboth is divided into eight neighbourhoods, called blocks. The oldest part of the town is blocks A, B and C, of which block B contains most public services and shops. Block D is home to the wealthiest inhabitants of the town. Block E is the poorest neighbourhood and was originally (under Apartheid) designated for blacks. Blocks F,G and H are the newest neighbourhoods. The current mayor of the town is Mr. Pieters, living in Block E. Public amenities include a public hospital, primary and secondary schools and a district court with resident magistrate. The Oanob Dam, approximately six kilometres from Rehoboth, supplies the town with fresh water. The majority of the population consists of Basters.  History  Stamps for German South West Africa postmarked Rehoboth 1901 Kai «ÄGarub (traditional regnal title [Great Leopard]) Chief Hans Eichab of the «ÉAin√Æn Traditional Community of the «ÇAixa (Copper beaded) clan of the «ÄG√¥ak≈çsema Great House from the Garise royal linage. The aboriginals of Rehoboth and its surroundings are the now seemingly extinct and or greatly assimilated/ accultured San (Hai«Åom) and the Damaras, of the «ÉAin√Æn traditional community (or rather the Dama of the «ÉAib [aka «ÄH≈´«Égaoben]), a sub clan of the «ÄGowan√Æn (Dune Damaras/ Damaras of the Kalahari). They first came upon the hot water springs after the fall of the Damara cohession in the 16th century and named the site «ÄGao«ÅnƒÅ«Äaus (Fountain of the falling buffalo). The «ÉAin√Æn later permanently settled at «ÉNawases NE of Rehoboth in the mid 1700s under the reign of chief Xoma«ÄkhƒÅb (third in line of chieftain chronology) circa 1725- (1750). The traditional community is as per post-independent Namibian legislative framework is administred by a traditional authority («ÉAin√Æn Traditional Authority) under the reign of Kai «ÄGarub (regnal title- \\"Great Leopard\\") Chief Hans Eichab.\\"In 1793, van Reenen met with Damara ' gatherers in the region of the present-day Rehoboth\\"- SOUTHERN NAMYBYA c.1780- c.1840 KHOIKHOI,. MISSIONARIES AND THE ADVANCING FRONTIER - Tilman Dedering «ÄGao«ÅnƒÅ«Äaus was later renamed «ÄAnes (place of smoke) by the Kai«Åkhaun (Rooinasie Nama of «ÉHoaxa«Én√¢s) who for a short period had settled there before migrating to Hoachanas. The \\"smoke\\" referred to the steam that was rising over the hot water fountains on cold winter mornings. The «ÄH≈´«Égaoben decided to settle at a distance from the fauna rich springs of Rehoboth so as not chase away game roaming the site. In 1845 «ÅKhau«Äg√¥an (Swartbooi) clan arrived under the leadership of Willem Swartbooi («ÉHuiseb «ÇHaobem√¢b) and Franz Heinrich Kleinschmidt of the German Rhenish Missionary Society. Kleinschmidt named the place Rehoboth that year, and established a Rhenish Mission Station there. In 1864, the Nama abandoned the area as a result of an attack by the Orlam Afrikaners. Rehoboth means \\"streets\\" in Hebrew. The arrival of the «ÄH√¥a«Äaran (Oorlam Afrikaner) in «ÄAe«Ågams (Windhoek) in 1840 marked the start of the «ÄH√¥a«Äaran-«ÅKhau«Äg√¥an (Oorlam Afrikaner-Swartbooi Nama) feud. This feud lasted from 1840 to 1865, as the Oorlam Afrikaner attacked the Swartbooi Nama at Rehoboth in a bloody clash resulting in the Swartbooi Namas fleeing to «ÉAmaib in «ÉOe«Çg√¢b (Erongo region). The Rehoboth area was mostly bare except the Swartbooi Nama who were sheltered by the «ÄH≈´«Égaoben. In 1870, the Basters, who had migrated out of the Cape Colony in 1868, moved into the territory and were granted permission to settle at Rehoboth by the participants of the peace conference of Okahandja on 23 September 1870. Within a few years, the Basters were closely linked to the town of Rehoboth and became identified as Rehoboth Basters or Rehobothers. The population increased rapidly from an initial number of 333 in 1870, 800 in 1874 and 1500 by 1885. The growing Baster population settled in the surrounding areas, which would become known as the Rehoboth Gebiet (\\"Gebiet\\": ). Rehoboth in 1908 In 1885, Baster Kaptein Hermanus van Wyk signed a 'Treaty of Protection and Friendship' with the German Empire which permitted him to retain a degree of autonomy in exchange for recognizing colonial rule. Relations between Rehoboth and Germany remained close for more than twenty years, but in 1914, following the outbreak of World War I, Germany's use of Baster soldiers to guard South African prisoners ‚Äî contrary to the terms of their enlistment ‚Äî led to armed revolt. German forces then attacked Rehoboth, committed atrocities against Baster civilians and attacked refugees encamped upon the mountain of Sam Khubis, but, despite repeated attacks and the use of superior weaponry, were unable to destroy the Basters' position. On the following day the Germans retreated and Rehoboth's Baster community was reprieved. Namibia was occupied by South Africa in 1915 and, ten years later, a second rebellion broke out at Rehoboth. This revolt collapsed, however, when colonial forces, armed with machine guns and supported by two warplanes, marched into the town and arrested more than 600 people. Politics Administratively, Rehoboth is classified as a town with its own council of 7 elected individuals. The 2015 local authority election was won by the SWAPO party which gained four seats (4,519 votes), while the local United People's Movement (UPM) gained three seats (3,101 votes).  Transport  The town is served by Rehoboth railway station. There is also a private landing strip, for small aircraft near the Oanob Dam. To the west is Gamsberg Nature Reserve.

Noktu was the only consistent member of the band. Celestia disbanded in 2015. Celestia remained in the demo stage until around 1999 when they released the EP \\"A Cave Full of Bats\\" through Drakkar Productions with a line-up consisting of Noktu (vocals, bass) and Fure√Øss/Franck (guitar). A few more demos, singles, split albums and a live album were done before they finally released their first studio album Apparitia - Sumptuous Spectre (2002) through Full Moon Productions with the drummer Astreyla added to the line-up. The two main members of Celestia were Noktu and Fure√Øss. Fure√Øss was the only guitarist for Celestia from 1998 to 2005, i.e. from the promo tape \\"A Dying Out Ecstasy\\" (1998) until the second mix of the 2002 album Apparitia Sumptuous Spectre in 2005, and he composed half the songs (the other half by Noktu) and arranged and recorded all the tracks on Celestia during this time. The latter- day line-up was Noktu (vocals, guitar, bass) and Ghaast (guitar). With the drummer Astreyla, who left the band, they recorded Celestia's second album Frigidiis Apotheosia : Abstinencia Genesiis, released in 2008 through Apparitia records and generally keeping the same minimalistic black metal sound. Malefic (Xasthur), a guest on the album, also added some keyboards to the music. Various session drummers and guitarists were brought in for rehearsals, recordings and live shows. Noktu also owns a record label called Drakkar Productions, on which he released some of The Black Legions (a group of French underground black metal bands) albums. Noktu also played in the band Mortifera, doing guitar, bass and vocals, while Neige (Alcest) handled the drums, half of the vocals and composed tracks such as \\"Ciel Brouill√©\\" and \\"Le Revenant\\". Mortifera has almost the same sound as Celestia. As well, Noktu has played in Genocide Kommando and Gestapo 666.

It is located along the A19 road. The city has a population of approximately 203,309, and it is the seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Songea. Between 1905 and 1907, the city was a centre of African resistance during the Maji Maji Rebellion in German East Africa. The city is poised to experience significant economic growth in the near future as the Mtwara Corridor opens up in a few years. History Songea was a great Ngoni warrior, hanged in 1906 during the time of German repression of the Maji Maji rebellion. Songea had been spared the death sentence because he had surrendered. However he demanded to be hanged along with the other Ngoni leaders. The Germans complied. After the Second World War, the area was marked for rapid agricultural development linked to the ultimately disastrous groundnut scheme. A railway had been planned from the coast to Songea and actually appeared in 1950s high school geography text books. During the liberation war with Mozambique the Songea area was a restricted zone and occasionally suffered aerial attacks by Portuguese forces. Its remoteness made it vulnerable to ivory poaching, and communications remained unreliable until 1985 when a new British funded road was opened linking it northwards to the road and rail hub of Makambako. Songea became a municipality in 2006.

It is home to Squaw Valley Ski Resort, the site of the 1960 Winter Olympics. Olympic Valley is the smallest resort area to host the Olympic Winter Games. History Native American Washoe people used the valley as a summer tribal ground before the 1849 California Gold Rush. When westward bound travelers first encountered the valley, they saw only women and children as most of the men were away hunting and so called it Squaw Valley. Squaw is a name used historically by white settlers for indigenous North American women and is considered an ethnic and sexual slur.\\"SQUAW - Facts on the Eradication of the \\"S\\" Word\\". Western North Carolina Citizens For An End To Institutional Bigotry. Retrieved 2017-12-10. When people ask \\"why now?\\" explain that: Through communication and education American Indian people have come to understand the derogatory meaning of the word. American Indian women claim the right to define ourselves as women and we reject the offensive term squaw. The town of Claraville, formerly located at the mouth of Squaw Valley was once among the biggest mining operations in the Lake Tahoe region. There were rumors that the mine was salted with ore brought in from Virginia City, Nevada. George Wharton James, author of the book The Lake of the Sky doubts the mines were salted with ore and suggests that the energetic prospector Shannon Knox started the mine with good faith. He writes about the History of the Tahoe Region (pre 1915) in many of the chapters of his book. The Squaw Valley Mining boom was short lived and by 1863‚Äì64 the valley had lost almost all of its inhabitants to the Comstock lode in Virginia City. By 1942, Wayne Poulsen, a former star skier from the University of Nevada, had acquired 2,000 acres (810 ha) in Squaw Valley from the Southern Pacific Railroad. Poulsen met Alex Cushing, a Harvard University-trained lawyer, in 1946 while Cushing was vacationing at Sugar Bowl Ski Resort. During his vacation, Cushing toured Squaw Valley at Poulsen's invitation and decided to invest in building a ski resort there. Unlike Poulsen, Cushing had the political connections and access to the capital necessary to create a ski resort. In June 1948, the two founded the Squaw Valley Development Company and Cushing replaced Poulsen as president of the Squaw Valley Development Corporation by October 1949. Squaw Valley Ski Resort opened on Thanksgiving Day 1949. The resort was constructed with $400,000 raised by Cushing, including $150,000 of his own money. The creation of the Squaw Valley Development Corporation and Squaw Valley Ski Resort mark the modern era of Squaw Valley. In 1954, Cushing began lobbying the International Olympic Committee to host the 1960 Olympic Winter games after he saw an article in the San Francisco Chronicle that detailed Reno, Nevada's bid to host the games. Innsbruck, Austria was Squaw Valley's biggest competitor in the running for the 1960 Winter Games, and Squaw Valley won the right to host the games by a vote of 32-30 on the second ballot. In anticipation of the Olympics, the official name was changed to Olympic Valley in 1960. The 1960 Winter Olympics were the first Winter Olympics to be televised live and attracted millions of viewers. In 2010, Squaw Valley Ski Resort was acquired by KSL Capital Partners, terming what they called a ‚Äúrenaissance‚Äù for Olympic Valley. With its acquisition, KSL announced $50 million in improvements to Squaw Valley. The total amount was increased to $70 million when Squaw Valley and Alpine Meadows merged in October 2011. Investments include upgrading chair lifts and snow-making and grooming equipment. In 2016, Squaw Valley Ski Holdings submitted a final application for entitlements for its proposed Village at Squaw Valley Specific Plan, a $1 billion plan that prompted the Attorney General of California to write a letter of concern to Placer County.Associated Press (April 16, 2015). \\"‚Äú$1-billion Squaw Valley development plan moves closer to approval\\", The Los Angeles Time.

Demographics Climate The climate of Olympic Valley is classified as Dsb (Continental Mediterranean Climate) under the K√∂ppen Climate Classification. Summertime is generally mild to warm, with cool nights, and winter time is cold and snowy. Sports Skiing and racing culture has been important to Olympic Valley since before it hosted the 1960 Winter Games. An athlete from Squaw Valley has competed in every Winter Olympics since 1964, when Jimmie Heuga competed in the IX Olympic Winter Games. Because of this, Squaw Valley has taken the moniker \\"Official Supplier of skiers to the US Ski Team.\\" Many members of the US Ski Team began skiing as a part of Squaw Valley's Mighty Mites racing team for five- to ten-year-olds. Notable winter athletes from Olympic Valley include: *Shannon Bahrke - Olympic skier *Travis Ganong - Olympic skier *Jimmie Heuga - Olympic Bronze medal winning skier *Nate Holland - X Games Gold medal winning snowboarder *Bill Hudson - Olympic skier *Greg Jones - Olympic skier *Jeremy Jones - Snowboarder *Kristin Krone - Olympic skier *Bob Ormsby - Olympic skier *Julia Mancuso - Olympic Gold, Silver, and Bronze medal winning skier *Tamara McKinney - World Cup Gold medal winning skier *Jonny Moseley - Olympic Gold medal winning skier *Michelle Parker - Skier *Daron Rahlves - Olympic skier *Marco Sullivan - Olympic skier *Eva Twardokens - Olympic Skier In addition to hosting the 1960 Olympic Winter Games, Olympic Valley played host to the 1969 FIS World Cup alpine skiing races. It also hosted the US Alpine Championships in the years 2002, 2013 and 2014 and the US Freestyle Championships in 2009. The area also hosts non- skiing sporting events, including the Western States Endurance Run, which begins at the base of the Squaw Valley Ski Resort. The 2013 and 2014 Ironman Lake Tahoe triathlon also began and ended in Olympic Valley. Arts and culture Olympic Valley has hosted the Wanderlust music and yoga festival annually since 2009. Other musical performances held in Olympic Valley include concerts by Jerry Garcia Band, Jurassic 5, Matisyahu, Yonder Mountain String Band, The Wailers, Brett Dennen, and Big Head Todd and the Monsters. Olympic Valley is home to the Squaw Valley Community of Writers, the organizers of the Squaw Valley Writer's Conference, and the Squaw Valley Institute. The Institute aims to foster \\"uncommon conversations\\" and hosts speaker events and other cultural events. Alpenglow Sports, a local sporting goods store, hosts the Alpenglow Winter Film Series at Squaw Valley, in which athletes and explorers from around the world share stories about their experiences and adventures. Government Olympic Valley is an unincorporated area located in Placer County, California. Placer County services the area. =Incorporation efforts= In August 2013, a group named Incorporate Olympic Valley (IOV) submitted a petition to the Placer County Local Agency Formation Committee (LAFCO) in order to begin the process of attempting to incorporate Squaw/Olympic Valley into a town named Olympic Valley. Proponents of incorporation originally wanted to include Alpine Meadows, California in its efforts, but the citizens of Alpine Meadows rejected the proposal. In December 2013, IOV submitted a formal application to the LAFCO which outlined the boundaries of the town they are proposing. Squaw Valley Ski Resort submitted a request to the Placer County LAFCO asking that it be excluded from the proposed town in April 2014. The Resort at Squaw Creek and Squaw Valley Lodge, two additional major businesses in the Squaw Valley area, submitted a letter to LAFCO in June 2014 urging the committee to deny the IOV incorporation application and to exclude them from proposed town. Save Olympic Valley, a group of residents, property owners, and business owners backed by Squaw Valley Ski Resort, has also questioned and expressed concerns about the incorporation effort. In November 2015, the Placer County Local Agency Formation Commission announced that its members would vote against incorporation of Olympic Valley. IOV formally withdrew its incorporation petition for Olympic Valley in early December. Controversy Incorporate Olympic Valley (IOV) is under investigation by the California Fair Political Practices Commission for allegedly violating multiple sections of the California Political Reform Act. The allegations relate to IOV's failure to file a statement of organization or monthly campaign statements for at least five months to the commission. Additionally, it is alleged that IOV did not include required disclaimers on campaign advertisements.

His most used double bass is named \\"Grammah\\", after the Ladies' tour manager nicknamed him \\"Grampah\\" for always complaining and not wanting to get up.CBC FUSE radio show - February 24, 2007 Early life Creeggan was born in Scarborough, Ontario. His mother taught piano lessons to neighborhood children, which Creeggan credits as part of the reason for his interest in music. Career Creeggan has played the double bass since he was in school. He was a member of a variety of school bands, as well as local youth symphony groups. He also attended the University of Toronto for bass performance, though he did not complete a degree. Creeggan, along with his brother Andy, was invited to play with Ed Robertson and Steven Page (then performing as Barenaked Ladies as a duo) at a Christmastime show in Toronto, and the pair was asked to join the band permanently. Creeggan has been with the band ever since, while his brother left the band in 1995. He and Andy formed a group together named The Brothers Creeggan before Andy left BNL. They continued to play following his departure, and went on a hiatus in the early 2000s. He regularly plays a double bass, both bowed and pizzicato. He has also played Electric double bass (including a Zeta bass circa Maybe You Should Drive, and a couple Ned Steinbergers later on), and bass guitar for BNL. He won the 1999 best male bassist award from the Gibson Guitar Corporation. He uses a French bow for his double bass. He has occasionally played guitar on some Barenaked Ladies songs; mainly on songs which he sings lead (though he also plays bass on some of those). Creeggan has also contributed to albums with each of the other members of the violin family, and has orchestrated musical charts for various band instruments to be recorded by session musicians. Creeggan made minor contributions to the writing of the band's first two albums, in the form of several co-writes. His first major songs contributed to an album was for the band's third release, 1996's Born on a Pirate Ship, which featured both \\"Spider In My Room\\" and \\"In The Drink\\"; two songs written exclusively by Creeggan, and both with him on lead vocals. He would record another song, \\"Inline Bowline\\" for 2000's Maroon, but the track was left off the album (later released as a b-side/bonus track). The band instituted a new, more open writing process for their next album, and several of Creeggan's song ideas were expanded into songs featured on 2003's Everything to Everyone. 2004's Barenaked for the Holidays featured a holiday tune, \\"Christmas Pics\\", sung by Creeggan, and 2006's Barenaked Ladies Are Me features Creeggan singing lead on \\"Peterborough and the Kawarthas\\", among other Creeggan co-written songs included. The band's 2008 children's album, Snacktime! features Creeggan co-writes \\"Louis Loon\\" and \\"Pollywog In A Bog\\", the latter of which he sang.

A left-handed pitcher, he appeared in all or parts of seven seasons in Major League Baseball for the Milwaukee Braves (1961‚Äì1963), San Francisco Giants (1964‚Äì1965), Chicago Cubs (1965‚Äì1967) and New York Mets (1967). Back-to-back 1965 battles with Koufax Hendley's career was hampered by elbow miseries. But he is perhaps best remembered for hooking up with Baseball Hall of Fame left-hander Sandy Koufax of the Los Angeles Dodgers for two classic pitchers' duels while Hendley was a member of the 1965 Cubs. On September 9 at Dodger Stadium, Hendley allowed only one hit, but Koufax threw a perfect game and defeated Hendley, 1‚Äì0.Retrosheet box score: 1965-09-09 The one run Hendley gave up came in the fifth inning and was unearned. It came without the benefit of a hit: the Dodgers' Lou Johnson took a base on balls (Hendley's only free pass of the game), moved to second base on a sacrifice bunt, stole third base, and came around to score on a throwing error by the Cubs' catcher. Although now trailing in the game, Hendley was still throwing a no-hitter. Two innings later, however, Johnson got his club's only safety, a pop fly over the head of Cub first baseman Ernie Banks that fell for a double. The walk and bloop hit were the only baserunners that Hendley permitted. Koufax' no-hitter was his fourth (over four consecutive seasons) and his only perfect game.Noble, Marty (2015-09-09), \\"The Day Hendley Allowed Just One Hit, Koufax Was Perfect.\\" MLB.com He struck out 14 Cubs, including the last six hitters in a row. Five days later, the two pitchers faced each other in a rematch at Wrigley Field. That time, Hendley gave up four hits and three bases on balls, but defeated Koufax 2‚Äì1.Retrosheet box score: 1965-09-14 Career Born in Macon, Georgia, the , Hendley graduated from Lanier High School and attended Mercer University. He signed with the Braves in 1958, and was in his fourth season in the Milwaukee organization when he made his MLB debut on June 23, 1961, a starting assignment against the Cubs at Wrigley Field. He battled into the eighth inning of a 2‚Äì2 tie, but left the game with the bases loaded and one out; two inherited runners then scored (one run was unearned), and Hendley took the 5‚Äì3 loss.Retrosheet box score: 1961-06-23 He was a member of the Braves' starting rotation in both and , then was traded to the Giants in a six-player deal on December 3, 1963; one of the three players the Braves received was Felipe Alou. Hendley was a member of the 1964 Giants' starting rotation, but began in the bullpen, making only two abbreviated starts among his first eight mound appearances. On May 28, Hendley, Harvey Kuenn and Ed Bailey were traded to the Cubs for Dick Bertell and Len Gabrielson. Although Hendley would be sent to Triple-A Salt Lake City for seven games, he was able to return to a starting pitcher role for the Cubs upon his recall, leading to his two September matches against Koufax. In , Hendley became primarily a relief pitcher, earning seven saves for a Cub team that lost 103 games that season. The following year, he was traded to the Mets on June 12, where, although he was again largely used out of the bullpen, he registered the last two complete games of his MLB career. The season also produced Hendley's only above-.500 record, as he won five of eight decisions. In his seven-season MLB career, Hendley won 48 games and lost 52, with a 3.97 ERA in 216 games, 126 of them starts. He struck out 522 batters and allowed 329 bases on balls and 864 hits in 879 innings pitched. He notched 25 complete games, six shutouts and 13 saves. He pitched at Triple-A for the Mets in 1968 and 1969 before leaving baseball. After retiring from the game, he went on to coach in his hometown of Macon at two high schools, posting winning records at each.

The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council held that loss will be recoverable where the extent of possible harm is so great that a reasonable man would guard against it (even if the chance of the loss occurring was very small). Wagon Mound (No. 2) should not be confused with the previous case of the Overseas Tankship (UK) Ltd v Morts Dock and Engineering Co Ltd or Wagon Mound (No. 1),. which introduced remoteness as a rule of causation to limit compensatory damages. Facts Overseas Tankship chartered a freighter ship named the Wagon Mound which was taking on bunker oil at Mort's Dock in Sydney. The engineers on the Wagon Mound were careless and a large quantity of oil overflowed onto the surface of the water. After several hours the oil drifted and was around two ships owned by the Miller Steamship Co that were being repaired nearby. Sparks from the welders caused the leaked oil to ignite destroying all three ships. At the trial in the Supreme Court of New South Wales, Walsh J found that (1) that the officers of the Wagon Mound would regard the oil as very difficult, but not impossible, to ignite on water (2) ignition of the oil on waters had very rarely happened, and (3) it was a possibility that would only eventuate in very exceptional circumstances. Walsh J held that Overseas Tankship were not liable for negligence, but that the large quantity of oil was a public nuisance and the Overseas Tankship were liable to pay damages for nuisance.Miller Steamship Co Pty Ltd v Overseas Tankship (UK) Ltd (1963) SR (NSW) 948. Overseas Tankship obtained leave to appeal directly to the Privy Council on the verdict of nuisance and the Miller Steamship Co obtained leave to appeal on the verdict of negligence. Judgment Former site of Mort's Dock, Balmain, New South Wales. The Privy Council upheld both the appeal and the cross-appeal. They held that it was not sufficient that the damage to by the Miller Steamship vessels was the direct result of the nuisance if that damage was unforeseeable. In relation to negligence the Privy Council held that a reasonable person in the position of the ship's engineer would have been aware of the risk of fire. Since the gravity of the potential damage from fire was so great there was no excuse for allowing the oil to be discharged even if the probability or risk of fire was low. A reasonable person, the Council held, would only neglect a risk of such a potentially great magnitude if he or she had a reason to do so, e.g. if it were cost prohibitive. Lord Reid said at 718-719, The words \\"real risk\\" are the requirement of remoteness of damage but the test of foreseeability does not depend upon the actual risk of occurrence. The test is really whether the engineer ought to have foreseen the outbreak of fire, i.e. the type of consequence ought to have been foreseen. Significance This idea of a balance between magnitude and seriousness of risk is similar to that proposed by Learned Hand in United States v. Carroll Towing Co. 159 F.2d 169 (2d Cir. 1947) on the subject of legal causation. Such a formulation of the issue has struck some in the field as an argument along the lines typically made in the Law & Economics camp usually seen to be represented by the American Judge Richard Posner.Richard Posner, \\"The Learned Hand Formula for Determining Liability, Tort Law: Cases and Economic Analysis (Toronto: Little, Brown, 1982) at 1-2. The holding in this case was harshly criticized for its \\"overloading of the foreseeability concept\\" by renowned torts scholar Leon A. Green.Leon Green, \\"The Wagon Mound No. 2-Foreseeability Revised\\", 1967 Utah L. Rev. 197, 205.

Family His grandfather William Hindmarsh was a gardener in Coniscliffe, County Durham. His father, John Hindmarsh, was born on 27 June 1753 and baptised at St Cuthbert's Church, Darlington. He was pressed into the Royal Navy, and eventually became a warrant officer of the Bellerophon. On 23 August 1784 Hindmarsh (senior) married Mrs Mary Roxburgh, a widow, at St George's-in-the East, Middlesex.'The Journal of the Northumberland & Durham Family History Society, Volume 12, No 2, Summer 1987, p40, From Durham to the South Seas, by FS Hindmarsh, (This is p13 of the pdf file.)

Naval career right Hindmarsh joined the Royal Navy either in April 1793 (aged seven or eight),Navy Estimates 1850-51, p66. or on 19 July 1790 (aged five). In 1793 he was listed on the muster roll of the Bellerophon as the servant of his father. He was schooled by Mr Neale, the purser of the Bellerophon. He saw action on the Bellerophon at the Battle of the Glorious First of June in 1794 and the Battle of the Nile in 1798. He was promoted to First Class Volunteer, when he was nine, for his actions at the Battle of the Glorious First of June. During the Battle of the Nile on 1 August 1798, the fire on board the French line-of- battle ship l'Orient put the Bellerophon (1786) in danger; all the other officers on the quarterdeck on the Bellerophon were killed or wounded, so 13-year-old Midshipman Hindmarsh gathered some of the crew, cut the anchor cables, and raised a spritsail to get the ship moving. Captain Darby then came on deck from having his wounds dressed.The Life of Captain Matthew Flinders, RN, by Ernest Scott, first published 1914, pub Cambridge University Press, 2011, p15-16 Nelson knew of this incident and referred to it five years later when he gave Hindmarsh his promotion to lieutenant on 1 August 1803 on board the Victory.The Letters of Lord Nelson to Lady Hamilton, Vol. I. , Letter 33, 1 August 1803, says: \\"I have this day made‚Ä¶ Mr. Hindmarsh, gunner's son, of the Bellerophon, who behaved so well this day five-year, a Lieutenant.\\" Hindmarsh suffered a contusion during the Battle of the Nile that resulted in him later losing an eye.Nelson s Battles: The Triumph of British Seapower, by Nicholas Tracy, originally published 1965, pub Seaforth Publishing, 2008, p72.

He received his commission as governor and commander-in-chief of the province of South Australia on 14 July 1836.

Prior to this, earlier arrivals included the Survey Brig , (carrying Colonel William Light's surveyors), , and . Initially they landed on Kangaroo Island, and sent out the team of surveyors led by Light to find a suitable place for the capital city of the new colony. Hindmarsh wanted it at Port Lincoln, instead of at the present site which had been selected by Light. Light eventually chose the site of Adelaide, and stationed the Cygnet at Port Lincoln to notify Hindmarsh that the capital would be located on the east Coast of Gulf St Vincent near Holdfast Bay, now known as Glenelg, South Australia (named after Lord Glenelg, the then Colonial Secretary). (Through Lord Glenelg the name derives from Glenelg, Highland (previously Inverness-shire), Scotland.) The name Adelaide was chosen by King William IV in honour of his consort Queen Adelaide.From Powder Monkey to Governor, p 90 Hindmarsh's proclamation on 28 December 1836 announced the commencement of colonial government and stated that Aborigines were to be treated justly and were 'equally entitled to the privileges of British subjects'. Although most South Australians have been taught that Hindmarsh's proclamation created the colony, it did not. William IV, having been empowered by an Act of Parliament in August 1834, in February 1836 Letters Patent 'Erected and Established' the Province of South Australia. No governor had the power to create colonies. There was some question as to the respective powers of the Governor and the Resident Commissioner, James Hurtle Fisher, and the two came into open conflict. Feeling ran high and when Hindmarsh went so far as to suspend Robert Gouger and other public officers, the commissioners brought the matter before the Secretary of State for the Colonies. Hindmarsh was then recalled to London in 1838. In 1840 he was made Lieutenant-Governor of Heligoland, where he served until 7 March 1857.From Powder Monkey to Governor, p 179 Hindmarsh was knighted by Queen Victoria on 7 August 1851, and retired in 1857 to the seaside town of Hove, England. =Hindmarsh's Proclamation= Issued at Glenelg on 28 December 1836: :In announcing to the Colonists of His Majesty's Province of South Australia the establishment of the Government, I hearby call upon them to conduct themselves at all times with order and quietness, duly to respect the laws, and by a course of industry and sobriety, by the practice of sound morality, and a strict observance of the ordinances of religion, to prove themselves to be worthy to be the Founders of a great and free Colony. It is also, at this time especially, my duty to apprise the Colonists of my resolution to take every lawful means for extending the same protection to the native population as to the rest of His Majesty's subjects, and of my firm determination to punish with exemplary severity all acts of violence and injustice which may in any manner be practised or attempted against the natives, who are to be considered to be as much under the safeguard of the law as the Colonists themselves, and equally entitled to the privileges of British subjects. I trust therefore, with confidence to the exercise of moderation and forbearance by all classes in their intercourse with the native inhabitants, and that they will omit no opportunity of assisting me to fulfill His Majesty's gracious and benevolent intentions towards them by promoting their advancement in civilisation, and ultimately, under the blessing of Divine Providence, their conversion to the Christian Faith.The Colonies and India newspaper [via newspapers.com], 4 March 1893 Legacy Hindmarsh lived at 30 Albany Villas in Hove for a number of years, where there is now a blue plaque in his honour.

It is not compatible with Canon's later Canon EF lens mount, though adapters made by independent manufacturers can be found. The camera will also accept Canon's earlier FL- mount lenses through the use of stop-down metering. Original FD lenses, introduced in 1971, do not rotate in the mounting process; instead, a locking ring at the base is turned to attach the lens. This was often criticized as being slower than the bayonet mounts of competing cameras. The counter argument, though, was that as the lens/body mating surfaces did not rotate, there was no wear that could affect the critical distance from lens to film plane. In 1979, Canon introduced the New FD series of lenses that rotate the whole outer lens barrel to lock. The inner lens barrel remains stationary, and thus the signal levers and pins still do not rotate. During the late 1970s, there were over 50 Canon FD lenses available for purchase. They ranged from a Fisheye FD 15 mm f/2.8 SSC to a FD 800 mm f/5.6 SSC, plus special purpose lenses such as a 7.5mm circular fisheye and a 35 mm tilt and shift lens. Accessories for the AE-1 include the Canon Winder A (motorized single frame film advance up to 2 frames per second), the Canon Databack A (sequential numbering or date stamping on the film), and the Canon Speedlite 155A (guide number 56/17 (feet/meters) at ASA 100) and Canon Speedlite 177A (guide number 83/25 (feet/meters) at ASA 100) electronic flashes. The later Power winder A2 is also compatible, but the Motor Drive MA is not. The AE-1 is a battery- powered (one 4LR44 or 4SR44) microprocessor-controlled manual focus SLR. It supports either manual exposure control or shutter priority auto exposure. The exposure control system consists of a needle pointing along a vertical f-stop scale on the right side of the viewfinder to indicate the readings of the built-in light meter (center-weighted with a silicon photocell). The viewfinder used by the AE-1 is Canon's standard split image rangefinder with microprism collar focusing aids.  Design history  Canon AE-1 detail The AE-1 was the first in what became a complete overhaul of Canon's line of SLRs. The 1970s and 1980s were an era of intense competition between the major Japanese SLR brands: Canon, Nikon, Minolta, Pentax and Olympus. Between 1975 and 1985, there was a dramatic departure from heavy all-metal manual mechanical camera bodies to much more compact bodies with integrated circuit (IC) electronic automation. In addition, due to rapid advances in electronics, the brands leap-frogged each other with successively more automated models. Although Canon Camera K. K. had been making quality 35 mm cameras for decades, it had since the late 1950s been overshadowed by their rival Nippon Kokagu K. K. and their Nikon cameras. While Canons easily led in the amateur compact fixed-lens market (where Nikons did not compete), Canon SLRs didn't have the professional features of the top-end Nikon SLRs. Nikon, with its solid reputation for quality of material and workmanship, held a stranglehold on the prestigious professional SLR market that competitors could not break. The AE-1 was the vanguard of the landmark Canon amateur level A-series SLRs and led Canon's charge into the emerging electronically controlled SLR market. The other members of the A-series were the AT-1 (released 1977), A-1 (1978), AV-1 (1979), AE-1 Program (1981) and AL-1 (1982). They all used the same compact aluminum alloy chassis, but with different feature levels and outer cosmetic plastic top panel. By sharing most major components, including an inexpensive horizontal cloth-curtain shutter, viewfinder information display, and autoflash control, Canon further reduced costs and could undercut the price of the more expensive SLRs then on the market. In keeping with its cost-cutting philosophy, Canon designed the AE-1 to use a significant amount of structural plastic for a lighter and cheaper camera at the expense of being less impact resistant. Canon went to great effort to disguise the use of plastic - the injection-molded acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) for the top panel finished with either satin chrome (or black enameled) to give the look and feel of metal. The bottom plate were made of brass and then finished with satin chrome (or black enameled). Extensive use of electronics also allowed simpler modular internal construction instead of mechanical linkages. Five major and 25 minor internal modules reduced the individual parts count by over 300. Modular construction, in turn, allowed automated production lines in order to reduce cost. Unfortunately, cost concerns also resulted in the use of plastic in some of the moving/operating mechanisms. The AE-1 was never designed to be a professional camera. However, it was made to have relatively straightforward controls and automatic aperture for newcomers, with various manual controls and system accessories to appeal to more experienced photographers. The AE-1 was the first SLR purchased by millions of amateur photographers, persuaded by its feature list and low price. In many ways, the AE-1 represented the confluence of two streams of Canon camera development. The first generation electronically controlled 35 mm SLR Canon EF (1973) merged with the final generation rangefinder Canonet G-III QL17 (1972). After decades of chasing Nikon for Japanese optical supremacy, Canon finally hit upon a formula for success: high technology for ease of use, cheaper internal parts and electronics for lower price, and heavy advertising to get the message out. Despite outcries from traditionalist photographers who complained about an ‚Äúexcess‚Äù of automation ruining the art of photography, automation proved to be the only way to entice the amateur photographer. The AE-1 had only one pointer needle used to indicate the light meter recommended f-stop, and neither a follower needle to indicate the actual lens set f-stop, nor plus/minus indicators for over/underexposure. The shutter-priority system of the AE-1 was more suited to sports action than to preserving depth-of-field, yet the 1/1000 s top speed of its horizontally traveling shutter limited its use for such activities. The battery door design was subject to frequent breakage, and over time owners have reported instances of shutter and mechanical gremlins, including mirror linkage wear (the \\"Canon squeal\\"). Canon's eventual abandonment of the FD lens mount for the EOS autofocus design also had an effect on prices for the AE-1 on the used market.

Geography  = Location = The municipality lies on Bundesstra√üe 257 between Daun (19 km) and Bitburg (24 km) in the middle of the Vulkaneifel, a part of the Eifel known for its volcanic history, geographical and geological features, and even ongoing activity today, including gases that sometimes well up from the earth. The German Volcano Route, which opened in September 2006, runs past the village. The village sits in the valley of the D√ºmpelbach at a mean elevation of 480 m above sea level. The highest elevations in the area are the Daxelberg at 589 m above sea level and Rackenbach at 522 m above sea level. The Schafbach, which empties into the Lohsalm, rises in the Salmwald (forest), a water-rich area with a waterworks. From here, great parts of the Bernkastel-Wittlich district are supplied with drinking water. 400px 400px = Neighbouring municipalities = All the following are Meisburg‚Äôs immediate neighbours: { cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\"  valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"25%\\"  * Densborn * Deudesfeld * Oberkail * Salm  valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"25%\\"  * Schutz * Wallenborn * Weidenbach }  History  The Eifel‚Äôs settlement history gives clues as to when the village of Meisburg might have arisen. Finds from the New Stone Age from about 4500 to 1800 BC and clues to Roman settlement about AD 300 in what is now Meisburg‚Äôs municipal area bear witness to human habitation here quite early on. The municipality owns a collection of Stone-Age stone hatchets, blades, scraping tools and arrowheads. Following the Celts were the Romans. The Roman road known as the Weinstra√üe (‚ÄúWine Road‚Äù) also came through the Meisburg area, running from Kirn in the Hunsr√ºck by way of Wittlich, and then on the Rackenbacher Wies‚Äôchen (a ‚Äúlittle meadow‚Äù) past nearby Meisburg to Pr√ºm and Malmedy. The Rheinisches Landesmuseum Trier has confirmed an ancient settlement in the rural cadastral area ‚ÄúIn der Delt‚Äù from the 2nd and 3rd centuries, presumably a Roman farm. The Romans were driven out by Germanic tribes, and later in the course of the Migration Period came the Franks. In Meisburg, a Moselle Franconian dialect is still spoken today. Although the municipality marked 750 years of existence in 1979, but it is quite a bit older than that. Meisburg was first mentioned (as ‚ÄúMeisbreth‚Äù) in a document of Pope Innocent II in 1140 as property of the abbey Saint Maximin in Trier. The village probably existed around 1116, when the monks of Saint Maximin forged several charters, wherein Meisburg is mentioned as ‚ÄúMeisbrath‚Äù. In 1229 Theoderich and his wife Clarissa, the Lord and Lady of Bruch, donated the patronage and two shares of the tithes at Meisburg to Saint Thomas‚Äôs Monastery. In 1330, a church was already listed in the village and Meisburg belonged to the Electoral-Trier Amt of Kyllburg. Saint Thomas‚Äôs Monastery was in the centuries that followed Meisburg‚Äôs landholder. When an end was put to the monastery‚Äôs landholding rights in 1794, the Amt of Kyllburg also ceased to be in force as the lands on the Rhine‚Äôs left bank were annexed by France. Under Napoleonic rule, Meisburg belonged to the Department of Sarre, and more locally to the canton of Pr√ºm. At the Congress of Vienna in 1814 and 1815, this area was assigned to Prussia. The district of Daun was formed and Meisburg belonged to the B√ºrgermeisterei (‚ÄúMayoralty‚Äù) of Weidenbach, later being reassigned to the B√ºrgermeisterei of Niederstadtfeld. Since 1947, it has been part of the then newly founded state of Rhineland-Palatinate, and the former administration in Niederstadtfeld was absorbed into the Verbandsgemeinde of Daun. The centralized water supply came to the village in 1920, and electricity in 1924. The provincial road, now known as Bundesstra√üe 257, between Daun and Kyllburg was built in the 1930s. There is one ghost village near Meisburg, named Rackenbach, and there is also a vanished village, which was called Bradscheid. As early as 1522, a mill was mentioned. The sawmill on the river Lohsalm is the only working, water-driven sawmill left in the Rhineland. About 2 km up the dale, the remnants of a further mill together with a millrace may still be found. The Schafbr√ºck, today a hotel, already existed in the 19th century. In the early 1950s, three outlying farms were established at Rackenbach and three more at Rascheid; all are still going concerns. A school was first mentioned in Meisburg in 1721. This was closed in the course of school reform in 1978. The Wallenborn primary school and the Niederstadtfeld Hauptschule are now the schools for the municipality. A Gymnasium and a Realschule are to be found in Daun and Gerolstein. The former school building in Meisburg now houses the kindergarten for Deudesfeld, Meisburg, Wallenborn and Weidenbach.Meisburg‚Äôs history  Politics  = Municipal council = The council is made up of 6 council members, who were elected at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman. = Mayor = Meisburg‚Äôs mayor is Dieter Klein, and his deputies are Johannes G√∂rgen and Berthold Rieker. = Coat of arms = The German blazon reads: Von silber √ºber schwarz geteilt, oben das kurtrierische Kreuz, unten ein rot-silber geschachtelter Schr√§grechtsbalken. The municipality‚Äôs arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Per fess argent a cross gules and sable a bend countercompony of the first and second. The cross above the line of partition is Electoral Trier‚Äôs old armorial bearing and represents Meisburg‚Äôs allegiance to Trier in feudal times. The bend countercompony (that is, slanted stripe chequered in two rows) is the charge borne by the Cistercians. This stands for the village‚Äôs former landholder, Saint Thomas‚Äôs Monastery, which held Meisburg from 1229 to 1794.Description and explanation of Meisburg‚Äôs arms = Town partnerships = Meisburg fosters partnerships with the following places: * Schoppen, Li√®ge, Belgium since 1967.

Its western end is in Ulster County, where it begins as the continuation of the short U.S. Route 209 expressway east of its interchange with U.S. Route 9W; after crossing the Kingston‚ÄìRhinecliff Bridge over the Hudson River the rest of the highway crosses northern Dutchess County. As it does it passes through downtown Red Hook and Pine Plains, reaching its eastern end at U.S. Route 44 and State Route 22 southwest of Millerton in the upper Harlem Valley. The portion of Route 199 east of its junction with the Taconic State Parkway was originally part of the Ulster and Delaware Turnpike, a toll road linking Bainbridge to Salisbury, Connecticut. This segment of the turnpike was incorporated into New York State Route41, a new route connecting Barrytown to Millerton, in the mid-1920s. NY41 was renumbered to 199 as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. When the Kingston‚ÄìRhinecliff Bridge opened in 1957, NY199 was realigned to continue across the bridge to the town of Ulster. The former routing of the highway between Barrytown and NY 9G along Barrytown Road remained state maintained until 1980, when ownership and maintenance of the highway was transferred to Dutchess County. It is now designated as County Route82 (CR82). Route description =Route 9W to Red Hook= alt=Aerial view of a bridge approaching a fog-covered river The western terminus of Route 199 is the northern terminus of U.S. Route 209 in Ulster County. When the expressway section of the latter road reaches the cloverleaf interchange with US 9W, in the town of Ulster, between Kingston and Lake Katrine, it assumes the 199 designation as it continues eastward through woodlands. Veering slightly northward, it has another interchange with State Route 32 after a mile (1.6km), with the eastbound lanes reaching the toll booth for the Kingston‚ÄìRhinecliff Bridge further on. West of the toll booth, the expressway ends as the road narrows to two lanes to cross the bridge, on an east- southeast heading. On the east bank, now in the Dutchess County town of Rhinebeck, it remains two lanes as it traverses wooded areas, part of the Hudson River Historic District, a National Historic Landmark. The road returns to a due-east course shortly after the crossing; it has its first traffic light at the intersection with River Road (also County Route 103). At past that intersection, the highway reaches another traffic light at State Route 9G. It joins that highway northbound, immediately entering the town of Red Hook, for a two-mile (3.2km) stretch through woodlands, first heading northwest then due north. The two lanes widen to four on either side of the Rokeby Road intersection. alt=A road in a rural landscape beneath a blue sky, dropping down slightly below the camera and continuing straight for a great distance, with telephone poles and an intersecting road at its left The 9G concurrency ends a mile to the north, where the roadway reaches another traffic light after a bend northeast. Here NY 199 turns east, going over a slight rise and then trending slightly southward towards the village of Red Hook. At the village line, a mile east of NY 9G, it passes Red Hook High School, the historic Maizefield estate, and the middle school, becoming West Market Street. At the center of town, another traffic light marks the intersection with U.S. Route 9. =Red Hook to Pine Plains= NY 199 becomes East Market Street and leaves the village approximately a half-mile (800m) to the east, curving gently through a mix of fields and woodlots in the surrounding landscape. A mile (1.6km) past the village, the road makes the first of four crossings of the Saw Kill. After crossing the Lakes Kill a thousand feet (300m) further on, the road starts a long turn southeastward past the former Sky Park Airport and Red Hook Golf Club. The Saw Kill crosses again just north of the end of this section, at the small hamlet of Rock City, where the towns of Red Hook, Rhinebeck and Milan meet. State Route 308 has its eastern terminus here, and a signal over the third crossing of the Saw Kill regulates traffic as NY 199 makes the abrupt turn eastward again. A sculpture of an oversized fork marks this \\"fork in the road\\". The road and the Saw Kill parallel each other for another mile of rural landscape before the stream makes its final and uppermost crossing just past the Milan Hill Road (County Route 54) intersection on the north side. Past this point the highway bends southeast again, crossing Little Wappingers Creek, as the landscape becomes hillier and more wooded. A mile and a half further it resumes heading east, past Milan's town hall, to its interchange with the Taconic State Parkway, climbing slightly. East of the Taconic NY 199 crosses the small hamlet of Lafayetteville, turning to the north as it descends for a mile through a narrow, wooded valley to Wilbur Pond and Lafayetteville Multiple Use Area. For the next two miles NY 199 continues to descend, turning northeast and entering the town of Pine Plains midway. After crossing Ham Brook, the highway turns north northeast for three-quarters of a mile (1.1km), bending back to the southeast around the side of an unnamed hill. The road returns to an east southeast heading as it descends another mile and the hills abruptly give way to more level ground on the outskirts of central Pine Plains, where NY 199 passes Stissing Mountain High School and becomes West Church Street, still trending south. =Pine Plains to Harlem Valley= alt=A two-lane road stretching out ahead of the camera to a distant curve to the right. On the left is a rolling of fields, woods and two small houses with a brown fence running alongside the road At the junction with Main Street in the center of town, the first traffic light since Rock City also marks where State Route 82 comes in from the south. It forms NY 199's other concurrency when it joins the highway heading eastbound. The joined roads continue together east southeast back into the countryside for the next mile and a half. Just past Pine Plains' town hall, at Hammertown, NY 82 turns north, towards the Columbia County hamlet of Ancram, ending the concurrency. From this intersection NY 199 turns northeast again briefly, then east, into a landscape of rolling hills, farms and woodlots. Three miles (5 km) of long curves in a generally eastward direction, climbing slightly, it reaches another small hamlet, Pulvers Corners, at an intersection with County Route 59. East of there, the road drops briefly into a swampy area, then climbs again as it turns southeast. At the North East town line, it reaches 1,000 feet (305m) above sea level, the highest elevation along its route. NY 199 continues southeast down a narrow valley for its last to its eastern terminus, at U.S. Route 44 and State Route 22 southwest of Millerton. History =Origins and designation= On April 2, 1802, the New York State Legislature created a turnpike corporation for the purpose of building a road‚Äîthe Ulster and Delaware Turnpike‚Äîfrom the Susquehanna River in the vicinity of the town of Jericho (now Bainbridge) to the Connecticut state line at Salisbury. The portion of the Ulster and Delaware Turnpike east of the Hudson River was also commonly known as the \\"Ulster and Salisbury Turnpike\\" or just the \\"Salisbury Turnpike\\". The turnpike crossed the Hudson River from Kingston to Rhinecliff by way of the Kingston‚ÄìRhinecliff Ferry and used modern Rhinecliff Road and West Market Street to reach the village of Rhinebeck. East of Rhinebeck, the turnpike passed through the hamlets of Eighmyville, Milan, Lafayetteville, and Pine Plains and the village of Millerton on its way to the Connecticut border. The turnpike corporation operated through the late 19th century. December 2008 ice stormalt=Ground-level view of a highway lined with ice-covered trees. A sign on the right-hand side bears the route's designation. In the mid-1920s, the portion of the Ulster and Delaware Turnpike from Lafayetteville to modern NY 22 in North East was designated as part of NY 41, a new route extending from Barrytown, a riverside hamlet north of Rhinecliff, to North East by way of Red Hook, Lafayetteville, and Pine Plains. The designation lasted for only half a decade as NY 41 was renumbered to NY 199 as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. =Kingston‚ÄìRhinecliff Bridge= Initial plans for the Kingston‚ÄìRhinecliff Bridge, a structure that replaced the ferry between the two locations, called for the bridge to span the Hudson River between downtown Kingston (at Kingston Point) and the village of Rhinebeck along a corridor similar to that of then-NY 308\\\\. Due to political and economic factors, the bridge site was moved upstream (northward). The partially completed bridge opened to traffic on February 2, 1957, as a realignment and extension of NY 199\\\\. The route left its original alignment east of Barrytown and followed NY 9G southward to the eastern bridge approach in the town of Rhinebeck. From there, NY 199 crossed the new bridge and ended at a junction with NY 32 just west of the Hudson River, then the western endpoint of the Kingston bridge approach. An extension of NY 199 west to US 9W was completed in the late 1950s; in 1964 the completion of the Catskill Expressway portion of U.S. Route 209 allowed more direct access from Route 199 and the bridge to the New York State Thruway. The original routing of NY 199 from the Hudson River at Barrytown to NY 9G remained state-maintained as a reference route for just over two decades. On April 1, 1980, ownership and maintenance of the highway, named Barrytown Road, was transferred from the state of New York to Dutchess County as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. Barrytown Road is now designated as CR 82.

The most common use of MantisBT is to track software defects. However, MantisBT is often configured by users to serve as a more generic issue tracking system and project management tool. The name Mantis and the logo of the project refer to the insect family Mantidae, known for the tracking of and feeding on other insects, colloquially referred to as \\"bugs\\". The name of the project is typically abbreviated to either MantisBT or just Mantis. History Kenzaburo Ito started development of the Mantis Bug Tracking project in 2000. In 2002, Kenzaburo was joined by Jeroen Latour, Victor Boctor and Julian Fitzell to be the administrators and it became a team project. Version 1.0.0 was released in February 2006. Version 1.1.0 was released in December 2007. In November 2008, after a long discussion, the project switched from using the Subversion revision control tool to Git, a distributed revision control tool. In February 2010, version 1.2.0 was released. In July 2012, the MantisBT organization on GitHub became the official repository for the Project's source code. Features =Plug-ins= An event-driven plug-in system was introduced with the release of version 1.2.0. This plug-in system allows extension of MantisBT through both officially maintained and third party plug-ins. As of November 2013, there are over 50 plug-ins available on the MantisBT-plugins organization on GitHub. Prior to version 1.2.0, a third party plug-in system created by Vincent Debout was available to users along with a variety of different plug-ins. This system was not officially supported by the MantisBT project and is incompatible with MantisBT 1.2.0 and later. =Notifications= MantisBT supports the sending of e-mail notifications upon changes being made to issues in the system. Users have the ability to specify the type of e-mails they receive and set filters to define the minimum severity of issues to receive notifications about. Users also have the ability to explicitly subscribe to issues that affect them. RSS feeds are available for users who wish to keep track of issues that have been resolved. Additionally, MantisBT has integration with Twitter via a plugin, to allow a notification to be tweeted when an issue is resolved. Via MantisBT's event- driven plug-in system, it is possible to extend the built in notification support to run advanced scripts that perform additional notification actions (such as sending SMS messages or updating statuses in external project management systems). =Revision control system integration= Versions of MantisBT prior to 1.2.0 allowed for limited integration with the CVS revision control system. With the introduction of plug-in capabilities in MantisBT 1.2.0, revision control integration was redeveloped by John Reese in the SourceIntegration plugin. The initial release of the SourceIntegration plugin supported GitHub, GitWeb, SourceForge and WebSVN. Over time, two additional modules were added and as of November 2013, source integration is supported for the following revision control tools and web-based providers: * cgit, a web interface for Git repositories, written in C * GitHub, an open-source software hosting facility that hosts Git repositories * Gitweb, a free and open source web interface for Git repositories * HgWeb, a cgi web front-end for Mercurial repositories * SourceForge (for Subversion integration only), an open-source software hosting facility that hosts various types of software repositories * WebSVN, a free and open source web interface for Subversion repositories * RhodeCode, an OpenSource web interface to Mercurial, Git and Subversion repositorieshttp://tononlabview.blogspot.fr/2011/07/connecting- mantis-with-rhodecode.html Upon committing changesets to a source code repository, post-commit hooks within Git or Subversion can be configured to automatically notify MantisBT that changes have been made to the repository. GitHub is also capable of remotely notifying a MantisBT installation of changes to a source code repository. Another technique used for integrating MantisBT with web-based source code hosting providers is the use of a job scheduler such as cron to manually check for changes to a repository every few minutes, reporting any changes back to MantisBT. SourceIntegration allows for issues within MantisBT to be automatically resolved when a changeset message contains special strings such as \\"Fixes #12345\\", which are configurable using regular expressions. This also allows for relationships to be automatically created between changesets and corresponding issues recorded in MantisBT. Multiple issue IDs can be specified in a single changeset message, although this is commonly discouraged as it indicates the changeset doesn't have a single, clear and logical purpose. =Minor features= In addition to the features mentioned above, MantisBT also has support for: * Full text search * Audit trails of changes made to issues * Revision control of text fields and notes * Roadmaps * Changelogs * Graphing of relationships between issues * Sponsorship of issues * Wiki documentation integration for DokuWiki, MediaWiki, TWiki, WackoWiki, WikkaWiki and XWiki * News * Project Management & TimeTracking with CodevTT. * Localised dozens of languages on translatewiki.net. Technical design =Development languages= MantisBT is mainly written in PHP and uses SQL to interface with databases. The web- based user interface of MantisBT is written using HTML which is styled and presented using CSS. The UI also uses the jQuery client-side JavaScript library to provide optional features such as Ajax and JSON powered dynamic page content. Development tools and build scripts are written predominantly in Python with some Shell script and PHP. MantisBT's codebase dates back to a time when PHP's support for object-oriented programming principles was in its infancy. As of version 1.2.0, the majority of the MantisBT codebase still uses procedural programming principles, however some sections have been converted to make use of PHP 5's new object model. =Database storage= Data is stored in a relational database management system by means of the ADOdb database abstraction library. MantisBT supports MySQL. Support for other databases ( PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL, Oracle ) is known to be problematic. The development team are looking to fix this for the 2.0 release. MantisBT maintains a database upgrade path between versions by modifying the database schema incrementally. During the installation of MantisBT, database schema modifications are replayed all the way back from early versions of MantisBT to reach the latest state. Requirements MantisBT requires a configured web server, the PHP programming language interpreter and a relational database management system supported by MantisBT and ADOdb. The stable branch of MantisBT (version numbers within 1.2.x) requires PHP 5.1.0 or later. For the development branch (1.3.x), the minimum PHP version is 5.3.2. Several PHP extensions are required to enable specific functionality or for performance reasons; the extension for the RDBMS being used (i.e. mysqli) is mandatory. MantisBT bundles a number of dependencies with each release including: * ADOdb for abstraction of support for relational database management systems * Disposable for disposable e-mail checking functionality * eZ Components for plotting of statistics * NuSOAP for SOAP web service support * PHPMailer for e-mail sending support * Projax for Ajax capabilities in the user interface * RSS Builder for RSS feed support * PHP UTF-8 wrapper library for internationalization support in absence of PHP's mb_string extension For drawing graphs of relationships between issues, GraphViz is required. MantisBT also has an alternative dependency upon the commercial JpGraph graphics library for plotting of statistics.

Thomas Edison was an inventor who accumulated 512Edison's Foreign Patents (add 3,500 U.S. total patents) patents worldwide for his inventions. 1,093 of Edison's patents were in the United States, but other patents were approved in countries around the globe. Introduction Edison is credited for contributing to various inventions, including the phonograph, the kinetoscope, the dictaphone, the electric lamp (in particular the incandescent light bulb), and the autographic printer. He also greatly improved the telephone by inventing the carbon microphone. Most of these inventions were not completely original but improvements of earlier inventions. However, one of Edison's major innovations was the first industrial research and development lab, which was built in Menlo Park and West Orange. Throughout the 20th century, Edison was the world's most prolific inventor. At the beginning of the century, he held 736 U.S. patents. His final count was 1,093 U.S. patents, including 1084 utility patents (patents for inventions) and 9 artistic design patents. It was not until June 17, 2003 that he was passed by Japanese inventor Shunpei Yamazaki.Shunpei Yamazaki's 1085th U.S. Utility Patent Yamazaki was subsequently passed by Australian inventor Kia Silverbrook on February 26, 2008.The patent where Silverbrook passes Yamazaki American patents =First hundred patents= The first hundred patents mainly deal with the telegraph system. John Kruesi was the shop manager beginning in 1872. Kruesi built models, instruments, and apparatus for Edison's work. John Ott worked with Edison throughout his career. Ott was Edison's main model and instrument maker. Charles Batchelor was a superintendent for Edison toward the end of this series of patents. * patent number ‚Äì name of patent (external links to patent images in TIFF format) Electrographic Vote-Recorder # ' ‚Äì Electrographic Vote-Recorder : Edison's first patent.

It is 35 kilometres west of London. Strathroy-Caradoc is a primarily rural municipality. Industries include turkey and chicken hatching and processing, corn, tobacco, automotive, and pharmaceutical. Some industrial products are manufactured in Strathroy, the township's largest locality and its commercial, cultural and industrial centre. Strathroy's hatcheries have seen it referred to as the turkey capital of Canada and even the world. Settlements within Strathroy-Caradoc largely grew up around the Sydenham River and the southwestern Ontario railways. Three major railway lines pass through the municipality: the CN (Canadian National Railway) Chatham Subdivision (connecting Windsor and London, Ontario), the CP (Canadian Pacific Railway) Windsor Subdivision (also connecting Windsor and London), and the CN Strathroy Subdivision (connecting London and Sarnia, Ontario). Municipally, Strathroy- Caradoc is within Middlesex County. At the federal and provincial levels of government it is represented by the riding of Lambton‚ÄîKent‚ÄîMiddlesex. It is part of the London census metropolitan area. Communities Strathroy- Caradoc's two largest communities are Strathroy and Mount Brydges. The township also contains the smaller communities of Cairngorm, Campbellvale, Caradoc, Christina, Falconbridge, Glen Oak, Longwood, Melbourne (part) and Muncey. =Strathroy= Strathroy is 35 kilometres west of the City of London, Ontario, and is the largest community in Middlesex County outside London. The community is situated next to Highway 402 between London and the border to Port Huron, Michigan, U.S. at Sarnia, Ontario. Strathroy's economy is diverse, and major industries include automotive manufacturing, agriculture and food processing. The township's administrative offices are located in Strathroy. =Mount Brydges= Mount Brydges has a small commercial \\"downtown\\" featuring mostly local businesses and shops. Local agriculture includes maize, tobacco and wheat. The soil composition of the region is largely sandy (a phenomenon referred to locally as the \\"Caradoc Sand Plains\\") as a result of deposits created on the bottom of the glacial Lake Whittlesey which covered the area approximately 13,000 years ago. The village came into existence as a result of the construction of the western division of the Great Western Railroad from City of London, Ontario to Windsor, Ontario, at the point where it crossed the existing road from Delaware, Ontario to Strathroy. This crossing happened to be at the point of greatest elevation on this division, the railroad having just climbed out of the valley of the Thames River from London. The station was named for Charles John Brydges the Managing Director of the Grand Trunk Railway from 1861 to 1874. The earlier name Carradoc was replaced in 1856. History Strathroy was first settled in 1832 by John Stewart Buchanan, accompanied by the explorer Sir Michael Jacques, at a location on the Sydenham River with flow and fall sufficient to power a grist mill. A general store opened in the settlement in 1840. Strathroy was incorporated as a village in 1860 and became a town in 1872 under the motto \\"We Advance\\". Buchanan named the settlement after his hometown of Strathroy in Ireland, now a suburb of Omagh in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland. In 1866, The Age newspaper was established to compete with the already-established Western Dispatch newspaper. The Western Dispatch was purchased by The Age in 1923, which later became The Age Dispatch. The newspaper is still published weekly. From 1867 to 1945 the Mount Elgin Indian Residential School operated in Muncey. Sir Arthur Currie, who would later become the commander of Canadian forces in Europe during World War I, was born here on December 5, 1875. In the fall of 1876, Bixel Brewery opened in Strathroy, producing lager beer for a century before its closing. Other breweries in the town have included the \\"Western Steam Brewery\\", \\"Strathroy Brewing and Malting\\" and \\"West End Brewery\\". In 1896, the Strathroy Furniture Company opened its doors, and was renowned for nearly a century for making residential furniture. On July 15, 1992, the company declared bankruptcy and a liquidation sale was held in October 1992. On February 14, 1914, the first patients were admitted to what would become Strathroy Middlesex General Hospital. At the time, the hospital was municipally-owned. The current building opened on June 23, 1962 as a two-story structure with 82 beds. The hospital was the location at which Native Canadian Dudley George succumbed to the gunshot wound he suffered at the Ipperwash Standoff at nearby Ipperwash Provincial Park on September 7, 1995. On January 13, 1954, West Middlesex Memorial Arena opened in Strathroy. To commemorate the occasion, the NHL's Montreal Canadiens played an exhibition game at the arena, defeating the local Junior 'B' team the Strathroy Rockets 14‚Äì3 in front of 3,100 spectators.A to Z Encyclopaedia of Ice Hockey - We In 2001, Strathroy merged with the former township of Caradoc to created the town of Strathroy- Caradoc. On March 22, 2004, the town's 117-year-old train station Blaze claims train station - London Free Press, 22 March 2004 was destroyed by a fire that took more than 35 firefighters to get under control. Adolescent boys were charged with starting the fire.CN Strathroy In 2005, Strathroy was connected to the Lake Huron Water Pipeline. This ended the town's existing reliance on groundwater and wells. On August 10, 2016 an Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant supporter from Strathroy, Aaron Driver, was killed in a taxi outside his home, after being shot by Royal Canadian Mounted Police and detonating one of two homemade bombs. The taxi driver was injured.

This mode sets both the shutter speed and aperture automatically--albeit with a slight bias towards the shutter speed setting. The user focuses the camera and then presses the shutter button. For those desiring more control, the AE-1's shutter priority auto-exposure and full manual modes are still available. Like the A-1, the AE-1 Program has a right-hand \\"action grip\\" on the front of the camera. It also supports the A-1's Motor Drive MA; this requires another electrical contact on the base plate. The AE-1's Power Winder A, and a new, faster Power Winder A2, are also supported. The viewfinder uses LEDs to show information to the user. Also like the A-1, the AE-1 Program supports interchangeable focusing screens. Unlike the A-1, though, which specifies that screens should only be changed by the factory or by experienced service technicians, those on the AE-1 Program can be changed by the user. The camera came standard with the new split/microprism screen, but seven others were available. Unfortunately, the AE-1 Program retains the older A-series type electromagnet-controlled cloth-curtain shutter that limits top shutter speed to 1/1000 of a second, together with a rather slow flash sync speed of 1/60 second. In the years since the AE-1 Program was introduced, this shutter design has also proven to be more maintenance-intensive than modern vertical-travel metal blade designs. The camera's electronics and electromagnets are powered by one 4SR44, PX28A, A544, K28A, V34PX, 4LR44, or L544 alkaline batteries. The focusing screen on the AE-1 Program is brighter than any previous focusing screen on any Canon manual focus camera, allowing the user to focus with greater ease with \\"slow\\" lenses (up to f/5.6). It is the same focusing screen design that is used in the newest model of the top-of-the-line Canon F-1 (known as the New F-1). The additional electronics used for the program features of the AE-1P have resulted in more electronic gremlins over the years, and the model is considered by some more difficult to repair than earlier and simpler A-series cameras. In its day, however, the AE-1 Program's automated features and simple controls helped introduce many new consumers to the SLR camera.

The Spec Miata (SM) class is intended to provide the opportunity to compete in low-cost cars with limited modifications, suitable for racing competition. It is intended to encourage low cost, entry level, production car based competition. Spec Miata currently races both sprints and enduros where available. Mazda MX-5s (also known as Mazda Miata Roadsters) in model years 1990 through 1993 with 1600 cc engines, model years 1994 through 1997 with 1800 cc engines, and model years 1999 through 2005 with 1800 cc engines have been approved by the SCCA for Regional racing in all divisions of the SCCA. The class was approved for National SCCA racing beginning in the 2006 racing season. At the professional level, the SM cars are known as the Global MX-5 Cup. Spec Miata was first approved as a Regional class in the Southwest Division of SCCA in 1999 and the first race as an official class was at the Fiesta Carrera Regional, Texas World Speedway 2.90 road course on July 24, 1999 at 1:05 pm and included a starting field of 4 drivers: Tim Evans, Shannon McMasters, Bob Reinhardt and David Obeney finishing in that order. The first Spec Miata race for the National Auto Sport Association was held in February 2000 by the NorCal Region. At the national level, the \\"UPR Racing Supply First Ever Spec Miata National\\" was held in Avondale, Arizona at Phoenix International Raceway's infield road course on January 13, 2006 with Brad Rampelberg as the \\"First Ever\\" National race winner. Results of the 1st SCCA National Qualifying Race may be googled at: azscca 2006 National Double Double. Mike Helpin a local highly respected racer was awarded the 1st place trophy because Brad Rampelberg was disqualified for an undisclosed reason. Brads disqualification was later overturned by a SCCA board. Brad Rampelberg was named winner in later posted results. (may be seen at the above azscca website) As its name shows, Spec Miata is a \\"specified\\" class. This means that the rules for allowable modifications to the car are very strict. The class intends to put drivers on a very even footing by making their cars as identical as possible. The rules are far more conservative than the Improved Touring category, but provide equivalent safety measures. Because of the support of Mazda through Mazdaspeed, the wide availability of the car on the used market, plentiful and inexpensive parts, and the simplicity of maintenance on the cars, Spec Miata has become a very popular class. Also adding to the appeal is the fact that A Spec Miata can be raced in both SM and ITA/ITS in SCCA Regional Competition. A typical race-ready spec miata can be purchased on the market for $8000‚Äì$35,000 depending on race win history and specific modifications. A new MX-5 Cup (professional class) based on the ND series MX-5 costs $58,900 new, and champions of the national series can win over $200,000 to advance up the motorsport ladder. In August 2019, Mazda Motorsports and Winding Road Racing announced Spec MX-5, a racing class structure based around the MX-5 NC that is designed to be an affordable, tech- able, reliable and fun-to-drive option for club racers. Race cars in the division will feature Roush Performance cylinder heads, Penske Racing shocks, Eibach springs and sway bars, Pagid brake pads, Toyo tires, and more, and will have a curb weight of . Spec MX-5 will have select events starting in 2020. Class rules This section is not an exhaustive set of rules; it is intended to give the reader an idea of the preparation level of the cars in this class. An example of Spec Miata safety roll cage by Racefab Inc. Spec Miatas used a specific Bilstein shock with an adjustable coil-over suspension with Eibach springs and adjustable front and rear sway bars. Beginning in 2019 the Bilstein shock is being phased out in favor of a Penske Shock. Top mounts are different but otherwise the new setup retains the coilover sleeve and spring from the previous Bilstein setup. Depending on the Club, Toyo or Hoosier tires are specified. For SCCA SM, the Hoosier SM7 is the dry tire and H20 is the Wet Tire. For NASA, the Toyo RR is the Dry Tire and RA-1 is the Wet Tire. (205/50R15) is the spec tire size. Hoosier Tires will provide the spec tire for all National SCCA Events. The wheel size is fixed at 15x7, with the wheels weighing no less than 13 pounds. Cars with 1.6 liter engines (1990-1993) have a race weight of 2275 pounds (1057 kg) and first generation cars with a 1.8 liter displacement engine (1994-1997) have a minimum race weight of 2400 pounds. \\"NB1 Miatas\\" (1999-00) have a minimum weight of 2400 pounds. \\"NB2 Miatas (2001-2005) have a minimum weight of 2425. Overbore engines are a 15 lb addition. The 1.8 liter displacement cars may not run an aftermarket air intake and NB models must run a throttle restrictor, while the 1.6 liter displacement cars do not require a restrictor, may run a modified air box, and may remove the driver corner light. The class calls for \\"Stock\\" engines with some modifications allowed in the name of balancing factory tolerances. Engine Builders have been taking advantage of this for years, and \\"Top Prep\\" engines make 10-20 horsepower more than a healthy stock engine and cost several thousand dollars.

The Bank of Estonia () is the central bank of Estonia as well as a member of the Eurosystem organisation of euro area central banks. The Bank of Estonia also belongs to the European System of Central Banks. Until 2010, the bank issued the former Estonian currency, the kroon. The Governor of the Bank of Estonia, currently Ardo Hansson, is a member of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank. TALIBOR Prior to the introduction of the euro, TALIBOR or the Tallinn Interbank Offered Rate was a daily reference rate based on the interest rates at which banks offer to lend unsecured funds to other banks in the Estonian wholesale money market (or interbank market in Estonian kroons. TALIBOR was published daily by the Bank of Estonia, together with TALIBID (Tallinn Interbank Bid Rate). TALIBOR was calculated based on the quotes for different maturities provided by reference banks at about 11.00 am each business day by disregarding highest and lowest quotation and calculating arithmetic mean of the quotations. History =1919: establishment= The bank was established on 24 February 1919 by the provisional government of Estonia following the independence of Estonia. Two years later, Eesti Pank became a national bank and responsible for issuing the Estonian mark. =1927: Introduction of the first kroon= A new version of the Statutes was approved in 1927, according to which Eesti Pank became an independent note-issuing central bank with limited functions. The main tasks of the bank remained to guarantee the value of the money through currency circulation and through the arrangement and regulation of short-term credit volume. Through the sale of government securities, the bank became a true joint-stock bank. A foreign loan of GBP 1.35 million (27.6 million kroon) supplemented the foreign currency reserves, of which Eesti Pank received GBP 1 million. The gold and foreign currency reserves of the State Treasury were also transferred to the central bank. The fixed capital of the bank was increased from 2.5 million kroon to 5 million kroon. The sizes of the issues in relation to the reserves backing the kroon were determined. Long-term loans that had become illiquid were transferred to the Long Term Loan Bank, founded specifically for the purpose of releasing Eesti Pank from this burden.1927‚Äì1930 Central bank and monetary reform as a precondition for a strong economy Upon the Soviet invasion of 1940, Eesti Pank was nationalized as \\"the Estonian Republican Office of the State Bank of the Soviet Union\\". With the nationalization and the introduction of the Russian ruble as legal tender, it lost much of its functions. =1990: Reestablishment= Eesti Pank recommenced operations on 1 January 1990 after an interval of 50 years, though not yet as the central bank of an independent country. The fact that it was possible to restore the central bank in spite of the fact that Estonia was not yet independent was a paradox of that time. The Statutes of Eesti Pank were confirmed in March 1990, and 400 million rubles were allocated for the statutory fund. According to the Statutes, Eesti Pank was an independent public organisation, an issue centre subordinate to the highest authority of the ESSR. The main tasks of the bank included the following: * developing an economic strategy for the country and its execution in the field of currency circulation * the provision of credit, financing, settlements, and foreign currency relations * management of the currency and credit system * securing the stability of currency circulation; guaranteeing the purchasing power of the national currency and determining its exchange rate in relation to other currencies. Foreign Trade Bank take-over Eesti Pank took over the Tallinn branch of the Foreign Trade Bank of the Soviet Union, re-organising it into the Foreign Currency Operations Centre of Eesti Pank. The central bank also attempted to take other steps within its ability for the liberalisation of the economy and in order to make the transition to a market economy: it began organising currency auctions, publishing quotations of the number of rubles in circulation, issuing licenses for foreign payments and settlements, etc. Introduction of regulatory function At the same time it was necessary to begin transforming Eesti Pank into an actual regulator of the Estonian banking sector. At that time, settlements were performed through Moscow, the local Clearing Centre being subordinate to Moscow. In the first years, Eesti Pank was not yet able to regulate and inspect the operations of the local commercial banks. Reserves The formation of reserves backing the kroon was commenced. After the recognition of Eesti Pank as the legal successor of the central bank of the Republic of Estonia, established in 1919 during the independence period, the government of Great Britain decided to return the gold that had belonged to the pre-war Eesti Pank to Estonia. The restoration of the membership of Eesti Pank in the Bank for International Settlements was accompanied by the restoration of its rights to the gold and other assets deposited there. Reserve felling areas from the State Forest Fund worth 150 million dollars were also included in the balance sheet of Eesti Pank as an additional foreign currency reserve (although the latter had more a moral and an emotional value for the general public than a practical one). Reintroduction of the kroon The new banknotes (the second kroon) reached Estonia in April 1992. The Estonian kroon was pegged to the German Deutschmark to ensure stability. The German Bundesbank was informed of this. The Estonian kroon was declared the sole legal tender in circulation and Eesti Pank the only regulator of monetary relations in Estonia. Within three days, 1500 rubles were exchanged to krooni for each resident natural person at the rate of 1 kroon = 10 rubles. Almost the entire amount of rubles in circulation in Estonia was exchanged to kroons at the same rate (deposits, money held by enterprises, etc.). The rate was considered under-priced by many opponents, but it actually corresponded to the market rate of that time. Time and the later course of events have indisputably proven the correctness of the choice made. All the laws and other legal acts planned for the beginning of the monetary reform came into effect. Eesti Pank began to publish daily exchange rates of the Estonian kroon against the most important foreign currencies. =2011: Introduction of the euro= With the introduction of the euro on 1 January 2011, the Bank of Estonia became a member of the Eurosystem or the system of Eurozone central banks that of that collectively set and implement the zone's monetary policy. Some of the functions of the bank were taken over by the European Central Bank. Other functions, as well as membership to the European System of Central Banks remained.

Its capital was Jiangdu Municipality () (modern Yangzhou in Jiangsu Province). Some historians consider Wu to have begun in 902, when Yang Xingmi was named Prince of Wu by the Tang dynasty. All three rulers of Wu after 907 (when the Tang dynasty collapsed) were Yang Xingmi's sons. The first ruler Yang Wo was murdered by Xu Wen and Zhang Hao, and his two brothers after him were effectively puppets dominated by Xu Wen at first, and later Xu Wen's adopted son Xu Zhigao (Li Bian) who in 937 usurped power to establish Southern Tang. Yang Pu, the last ruler, was the only one to claim the title of Emperor; the other rulers were kings or princes. Founding The founder of Wu, Yang Xingmi, started his career as a volunteer soldier before seizing power in his home prefecture Luzhou in a military coup. The weak Tang court could only confirm his position. In 887 the governor of Huainan, Gao Pian, was captured by Bi Shiduo. Xingmi defeated Shiduo and captured the provincial capital Yangzhou later that year, but by then Pian had been put to death by Shiduo. Another rebel leader, Sun Ru had Shiduo killed and absorbed his forces. Yang Xingmi was forced to abandon Yangzhou and retreat to Luzhou. With Luzhou as his base, Xingmi increased his power by seizing neighbouring prefectures until he could recapture Yangzhou in 892. For this act, the Tang court granted him the military governorship of Huainan. While still nominally loyal to the Tang dynasty, rival warlords were now carving out their own statelets. Yang Xingmi clashed with Zhu Wen of Later Liang in the north and Qian Liu of Wuyue in the south, successfully defending his territory. In 902 Yang Xingmi was named Prince of Wu by Emperor Zhaozong of Tang. Independence Yang Xingmi died in 905 and was succeeded by his oldest son Yang Wo. In 907 Zhu Wen forced the last Tang emperor to abdicate and proclaimed himself the first emperor of the Later Liang. Yang Wo refused to acknowledge this change and continued the use of the last era name of Tang. From this point Wu was an independent, sovereign entity. Subversion of power by Xu Wen Young and untested at his father's death Yang Wo had relied on the director of the guard, Xu Wen, for his ascension, but later grew to resent Xu Wen's influence. However, before he could pull himself free, Yang Wo was assassinated by Xu Wen and his colleague Zhang Hao in 908. Wen and Hao had initially planned to divide Wu between themselves and submit to Liang, but they soon fell out. Xu Wen installed Yang Wo's younger brother Longyan and had Zhang Hao killed. Yang Longyan was a mere puppet with Xu Wen as the state's true ruler. Wen made himself Runzhou governor and moved his command to Jinling. The regular administration at the capital was left to his son Xu Zhixun. After Zhixun's murder in 918, this position was inherited by Wen's stepson, Zhigao. In 919, Yang Longyan proclaimed himself King of Wu and inaugurated a new era name, thus for the first time Wu officially claimed to be a sovereign state. Longyan died of illness in 922 and was succeeded by his brother, Xingmi's fourth son, Yang Pu. As before, Xu Wen had the real power. He prodded Yang Pu to proclaim himself emperor, but died in 927 before this could happen. 29 November 927 Yang Pu acceded the throne as Emperor of Wu. Xu Zhigao was made grand marshal and director of the Chancellery. Territorial Extent The Wu capital was at Guangling (present-day Yangzhou), and held present-day central and southern Anhui, central and southern Jiangsu, much of Jiangxi, and eastern Hubei. End of the Kingdom Xu Zhigao had been adopted by Xu Wen on Yang Xingmi's insistence and soon proved himself an able man. He came to power in Wu after his stepfather's death in 927 and continued to rule the state as governor of Jinling for some time. Finally in 937 he formally seized power for himself by proclaiming himself King of Qi and Yang Pu abdicated after suppressing the opposition of Yang Meng. Two years later, by claiming descent from a Tang prince Xu Zhigao and restoring his surname of Li, Xu Zhigao became Li Bian and proclaimed the restoration of the Tang. His state would be known to history as the Southern Tang.

A limited edition is restricted in the number of copies produced, although in fact the number may be very low or very high. Suzuki (2008) defines limited edition products as those ‚Äúsold in a state that makes them difficult to obtain because of companies limiting their availability to a certain period, quantity, region, or channel\\". A special edition implies there is extra material of some kind included. The term is frequently used on DVD film releases, often when the so-called \\"special\\" edition is actually the only version released. Collector's edition Collector's edition may just be another term for special edition and limited edition products that include additional features or items that regular versions do not have. When referring to books, collector's edition products may refer to books in special limited and numbered editions, sometimes hand-bound, and signed by the artist and containing one or more original works or prints produced directly from their work and printed under their supervision. Whatever these extra features or items are, they must represent additional value to collectors of these products. Disc products Popular culture widely employs Special, Deluxe, Expanded and Limited Edition in marketing, releasing subsequent, improved versions of film DVDs, music, and video games. Companies widely use special editions and incremental improvements to sell the same products to consumers multiple times. This has been seen in the 10th Anniversary edition of Titanic, which simply consists of the first two discs of the previous Special Collector's edition, only with new packaging, and on CD with the 30 Year Anniversary Edition of Bob Marley's Exodus, which has exactly the same content as the original album, but in new packaging. In many cases, successful film releases have had items made in limited numbers. These \\"limited editions\\" usually contain the best DVD edition possible of a film with special items in a box set, sometimes containing items available only in the limited edition. Items marked thus are often (but not always) released for a shorter time and in lower quantity than common editions, often with a running number (e.g. \\"13055 of 20000\\") printed on the products to boost the rarity feel, as the company implies not to manufacture more. It is also common to have such items packaged with unique designs. With the success of DVDs, special editions of films themselves (instead of just special editions of film DVDs) have also become fairly common. Sharing similarities with the concept of a director's cut (another long-suffering inflation-by-marketing term). These generally feature additional in-movie material. The material may be footage originally deleted from the final cut, or new digitally-created, interpolated content. Unlike true director's cuts, the directors may not have had part in such projects, such as in Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut, in which Richard Donner did not help create the new version, just supply the material. The Doctor Who television movie The Five Doctors was edited, recut, amongst various other changes, to make the \\"Special Edition\\" in 1999 for the first DVD release of the episode.  Limited edition prints  Limited edition prints, also known as LEs, have been standard in printmaking from the nineteenth century onwards. A limit to the print run is crucial, as many traditional printmaking techniques can only produce a limited number of best quality impressions. This can be as few as ten or twenty for a technique like drypoint, but more commonly would be in the low hundreds - print runs of over a thousand are regarded as dubious by the serious art market for original prints, even though with many techniques there is no loss of quality. Edition sizes higher than about 500 are likely to be of print reproductions of paintings, of much less value, though some modern techniques blur this traditional distinction. As in other fields, the use of the concept has become largely driven by marketing imperatives, and has been misused in parts of the market. In particular, lithographic, photogravure, rotogravure, and giclee reproductions of prints, derived from photographs of an original print, which are most unlikely to have any investment value, are often issued in limited editions implying that they will have such value. These need to be distinguished from the original artist's print, carefully produced directly from his work, and printed under the artist's supervision. = Consumer protection = In UK and New Zealand the Fine Art Trade Guild ensures the quality and verification of limited edition prints by employing a number of strictly administered regulations for all processes and aspects related to them. In the United States limited editions are regulated under state consumer protections laws. California became the first state to regulate the sale of limited edition art prints with the \\"California Print Law\\" of 1971. The state of Illinois later expanded on the California statute. However, it was not until 1986 that more comprehensive provisions, still in place today, were enacted with the passage of the \\"Georgia Print Law\\". That law became the template for statutes subsequently enacted by other states. The Georgia Print Law written by (former) State Representative Chesley V. Morton, became effective July 1, 1986. The law requires art dealers, artists, or auctioneers to supply information to perspective purchasers about the nature of the print, the number of prints and editions (including HC editions) produced, and the involvement (if any) of the artist in the creation of the print. The penalty for violation of the law ranges from simple reimbursement to treble damages, in the case of a willful violation. Those found to be in violation of the law are also liable for court costs, expenses, and attorney fees. The law applies to works of art valued at more than $100.00 (not including frame). Charitable organizations are specifically exempt from the provision of the law. The statute of limitations is one year after discovery, and, if discovery of the violation is not made within three years of the sale, then the purchaser's remedies are extinguished. A limited edition is normally hand signed and numbered by the artist, typically in pencil, in the form (e.g.): 14/100. The first number is the number of the print itself. The second number is the number of overall prints the artist will print of that image. The lower the second number is, the more valuable and collectible the limited editions are likely to be, within whatever their price range is. A small number of \\"artists' proofs\\" may also be produced as well, signed and with \\"AP\\", \\"proof\\", etc. Prints that are given to someone or are for some reason unsuitable for sale are marked \\"H. C.\\" or \\"H/C\\", meaning \\"hors de commerce\\", not for sale.  Music  In terms of musical albums, the term \\"deluxe edition\\" refers to a re- release of an album, generally a sufficient period after the initial release, featuring extra content related to the album. From the 2000s it has become commonplace for a deluxe edition to be released at the same time as the standard edition. The deluxe edition often includes some or all of the following: extra tracks; demo recordings of album tracks; live recordings of album tracks; alternate takes, mixes, or edits of album tracks; B-sides from album singles that did not appear on the album; DVD content, including music videos. These editions are commonly repackaged, with the new content on a second disc and many feature additional liner notes. Also, some albums are initially released in two editions, a regular retail version and a \\"special\\" or \\"limited\\" version in distinctive packaging and often including extras such as a second disc, a video DVD, or liner notes expanded into a hardback book. Generally, the special package is only produced for the first pressing or a set number of copies - some are limited to only being sold at one chain of retailers. It is important to distinguish this from an expanded re-release, since those are generally available widely and for a long period of time. Milking Milking, or double-dipping,You Just Love That Film? Buy It Again! refers to the practice of releasing multiple editions of the same product (usually a CD, DVD, Blu-ray Disc), simultaneously or at different times, with the purpose of enticing consumers to buy more than one edition. This can be done with, for example, a special edition, a director's cut, an ultimate edition, and a collector's edition, sometimes with different features or supplementary material. The consumer may be persuaded to purchase multiple editions, with the belief that the additional features or content will be worth paying for a product that is largely equivalent to one already owned.

His atelier, created in 1919, was located in the Paris suburb of Levallois-Perret. Chapron was born in Nouan-le- Fuzelier (Sologne), and began his career developing custom body designs for French luxury vehicles, like Talbot, Delage, and Delahaye, in the 1920s. France ceased building vehicles of this type in the 1950s, due to tax legislation that made luxury vehicles prohibitively expensive in France (see Tax horsepower#France). Chapron switched his attention to the recently launched Citro√´n DS. Chapron‚Äôs first rebodied DS coupe was the 1958 Le Paris. At first, Chapron purchased these vehicles and customised them as one-off creations. Many of these became unique convertible variants. His DS convertible caused a sensation at the 1958 Motor Show. Citro√´n managers came to see him in Levallois to offer him a production agreement. For 2 years, the Chapron and Citro√´n teams work hand in hand in order to strengthen the safety standards on the car and to minimize the cost of production. On the basis of a design by DS designer Flaminio Bertoni, Chapron developed a two-door convertible body that was sold through the Citro√´n dealer network. The Series convertible was presented at the 1960 Paris Motor Show. The official collaboration with Citro√´n began in 1961. A news item in the 20 July 1961 Daily Variety noted that Cary Grant had \\"telephoned the French automotive company, Citro√´n, to order a new car for use in the film\\" That Touch of Mink. The factory reportedly shipped ‚Äúthe display model‚Äù to the studio without hesitation and the car is prominently featured in the film, garnering key publicity for the model. Chapron built this \\"D√©capotable usine\\" (factory convertible) - 1,365 cars in all. This allowed buyers to benefit from a factory warranty on Usine convertibles purchased. The factory convertibles used a DS platform supplied by Citro√´n, which included all of the mechanics, front fenders, windshield and wheels. Chapron used the full chassis, but reinforced various elements in the floor area. The doors of the standard sedan have been lengthened by 18 cm; Chapron remade the rear fenders. Chapron continued making his own DS based vehicles, including the Croisette, Palm Beach, Le Dandy, Lorraine, and Le Leman. Unlike the factory convertibles, Chapron usually used a six centimeter lower windshield for his own models. The side windows - including the rear ones - could be lowered manually or electrically, unlike the factory car. A trained salesman and connoisseur, Henri Chapron wanted the finest leathers. While Citroen bought its leathers from Costil in Pont Audemer, Chapron ordered his from Connolly in England. In 1968, Chapron made a special extended DS Presidential model for the government of Charles de Gaulle. In 1972, Chapron delivered two SM Presidential models to the government of Georges Pompidou. These gigantic 4 door convertibles were first used for the 1972 visit of Queen Elizabeth II to France and continued in use through the inauguration of Jacques Chirac in 1995. The Presidentielle was pressed into service again in 2004, when Queen Elizabeth II reviewed troops on the Champs Elysees with Chirac 5 April, 2004, at the start of the queen's three-day state visit to France to mark 100 years of formal friendship between France and Britain. The Entente Cordiale, signed in London on April 8, 1904, resolved a number of colonial disputes and helped to forge an alliance against a resurgent Germany. The Citro√´n SM Mylord was designed as a two-door full convertible - i.e. without a roll bar. It was given a notchback body with a small trunk lid, which at the rear end authentically took up the design of the original vehicle - especially the raised license plate. The prototype of the Mylord was presented at the Paris Motor Show in 1971, and sales began a year later. The production was complex. Chapron received a standard body shell from Chausson. The technology and the floor pan of the SM Coup√© remained essentially unchanged; the wheelbase was also retained. The B and C pillars were removed, after which Chapron installed extensive reinforcements in the body area. The modified body was transported to Citro√´n, where the engine, chassis and other technical components were installed. Finally, the car was brought back to Chapron's workshop to do the interior and paint it. Overall, only a few Mylord convertibles were made; the sources vary between seven and eight copies. What is certain is that four vehicles were sold in France; two more went to Spain, one to the United Kingdom. One year after the Mylord Cabriolet, Chapron developed a sedan version of the production SM, the Opera. Chapron developed a sedan that remained true to the design of the original model and ultimately represented an extended version of the SM Coup√©. Starting with an SM body-in-white, Chapron extended the wheelbase considerably. The front doors have been shortened and some modifications have been made in the area of the belt line. The rear doors were an in-house design by Chapron. They took up the lines of the coup√© and also had the characteristic kink in front of the C-pillar. Finally, Chapron removed the large tailgate and replaced it with a notchback construction. The rear, in turn, corresponded to the design of the coup√©. The vehicle was very heavy and had lost some of the maneuverability of the coup√©. The Citro√´n SM Opera was presented to the public at the 1972 Paris Motor Show. In the following two years, Chapron manufactured a total of eight Opera sedans. At least two of them are still preserved. One vehicle that is in excellent condition is in the Netherlands, another is in Germany. Henri Chapron died in Paris in 1978, and the company itself survived for some time under the direction of his widow. Less than five months after Chapron's own death the company presented a Landaulet bodied conversion constructed for a rich Dutch customer, based on a lengthened Peugeot 604. There were hopes this might lead to a low but steady production of similar conversions, as had happened during with Chapron's lengthened specials based on the Citro√´n DS. That did not happen, but the company did produce some special luxury versions, with lavishly equipped interiors, of the Citro√´n CX. The Chapron workshops prepared several Landaulet (car) vehicles based on the CX 2400 Prestige, including a wedding car, delivered in 1981 and used for the first time for the wedding of Henri de Passau, Prince of Bourbon Parma and Grand Heir and Maria Teresa Grand Duchess. It was then used for the wedding of King Harald V of Norway, the Crown Prince of Norway, and Archduke Christian of Austria and Princess Marie Astrid, and finally Prince Nicolas of Liechtenstein and Princess Margaretha of Luxembourg for their respective weddings. Operations finally ceased in 1985. In the 2018 Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance, Citro√´n appeared as a featured marque, represented by many Chapron variants.

For males, the badge is worn as a decoration centered on the left uniform pocket, below standard awards and decorations. For females, it is worn on the right side, even with the bottom of their decorations.AFI36-2903: Dress and Personal Appearance of Air Force Personnel; dated 18 July 2011; accessed 11 January 2014 The badge is derived from the emblem of the USAF Honor Guard that was created in 1976 by Malcolm Haynes. It is composed of crossed M1 Garand rifles with fixed bayonets silhouetted over a silver/gray Roman helmet adorned with a scarlet red horsehair festoon on a field of ultramarine blue with the attached organization motto. The Roman helmet is symbolic of the Praetorian Guard of the Roman Empire---the original Honor Guard of the Western World---whose duty it was to protect the reigning emperor. The red festoon denotes courage and valor. The silver/gray of the helmet proper represents the excellence expected of all USAF Honor Guard personnel. The crossed M1 rifles historically denote the unit's primary weapon (the M14 rifle became the unit's primary weapon in 2002; however the Honor Guard's Drill Team still continues to use the M1). The ultramarine blue background symbolizes the primary theater of Air Force operations - the sky and beyond. The attached motto, \\"To Honor With Dignity\\" best describes the unit's mission.Official U.S. Air Force Honor Guard emblem, U.S. Air Force Honor Guard > Art > Media Gallery page, dated 12 January 2011, last accessed 17 May 2014 Some slight differences are apparent between the badges worn by members of the USAF HG, and those members of the BHGs. The USAF HG badge features the words \\"USAF HONOR GUARD\\" below and \\"TO HONOR WITH DIGNITY\\" above the main insignia and is polished silver. The BHG badge features the words \\"BASE HONOR GUARD\\" above and \\"TO HONOR WITH DIGNITY\\" below the main insignia and is multi-colored.Official U.S. Air Force Honor Guard Homepage The badge is worn only while actively assigned to the USAF HG or BHG; upon completion of the member's tour of duty it must be removed. Prior to the full implementation of the Airman Battle Uniform (ABU) on 1 November 2011, a subdued patch version of the BHG badge was sewn onto the old battle dress uniform; but since unit and duty patches are not worn on the ABU, both the USAF HG unit patch and BHG patch have been relegated to history.

When the heavy metal group Iron Maiden were having trouble getting permission to play in Beirut, Hayes threw his weight behind them (one member was a constituent). \\"I have advised [the Foreign Office] the group is not a bad influence,\\" he said. \\"In fact they are very good: I have all their albums.\\" After Parliament Following his career in Parliament, he wrote for the magazine Punch. In 2006, a bomb was found near his house in the village of Wendens Ambo, near Saffron Walden in Essex. In May 2010, Hayes started a political blog for the website \\"Think Politics\\", which also hosts blogs by former Liberal Democrat MP for Falmouth Camborne, Julia Goldsworthy, current Labour MP for Denton and Reddish, Andrew Gwynne, and Conservative candidate for Swansea West, Ren√© Kinzett. His blog has now moved to Total Politics. Hayes also regularly reviews the newspapers on Stephen Nolan's weekend late night show on Fridays at midnight on BBC Radio 5 Live along with Mohammed Shafiq, a media commentator on British-Muslim issues. Legal career Hayes was called to the Bar by Middle Temple in 1977. Hayes has practised as lead defence counsel in high-profile cases, including R v McGing and R v Tishane Bernard. McGing was a soldier in Basra accused of drowning a teenager whilst on patrol. He was acquitted. Tishane Bernard was accused of a gangland execution, and was also acquitted. He was instrumental in setting up Ten 17 radio with Tony Saxby and Russ Lewell in 1991. He acted as lawyer to John Hemming in his 2005 legal bid to challenge postal votes at the 2005 general election and has also defended celebrities and a British soldier in Iraq. Hayes also represented two Labour councillors accused of postal Ballot fraud in Birmingham.\\"Judge hits out at postal voting\\", BBC News, 22 March 2005. Retrieved 6 April 2014.

Early life and education Wallace was born in Atlanta, Georgia to Mary Lou and George Wallace Sr. Wallace was educated at Lynwood Park Elementary School and Lynwood Park High School. His mother died when he was sixteen, prompting him to move to Ohio where he found a job with Firestone Tire. As part of the company's tuition reimbursement program, Wallace enrolled in the University of Akron, in Akron, Ohio, where he studied transportation, marketing and advertising. Upon graduation, Wallace moved to New York City in pursuit of his childhood dream of being a comedian. At first, success in comedy proved elusive and Wallace worked as a salesman for an advertising agency to pay the bills. Career Wallace's break came when one of his clients opened a comedy club. The club owner was amused by Wallace's natural humor and friendly demeanor and offered him the chance to perform stand-up comedy. In 1977, Wallace walked on stage for the first time, wearing a preacher's robe and calling himself The Right Reverend Dr. George Wallace. His routine was completely improvised. He stayed in New York City for several years, perfecting his craft and living with friend and fellow comedian Jerry Seinfeld. In 1978, Wallace moved to the West Coast, where he quickly became recognized as a talented young comedian. After one of his performances, producers from The Redd Foxx Show asked him to write for the popular series. However, after only one year of writing, Wallace returned to the stage. He became a regular at The Comedy Store in West Hollywood, California, which also featured artists including Richard Pryor, Rodney Dangerfield, Roseanne Barr, Jay Leno and Robin Williams. Wallace also took his comedy show on the road, opening for George Benson, Diana Ross, Donna Summer and Smokey Robinson, among others. Wallace, who was named the Best Male Standup Comedian during the 1995 American Comedy Awards, says that his routines are inspired by everyday moments of life. His unique brand of social commentary proved popular with radio audiences as well. Wallace was a regular on the Tom Joyner Morning Show before joining Isaac Hayes on a popular radio program on the former WRKS radio station in New York City. He also starred in his own HBO special and has appeared on many television shows, including The Tonight Show, The Oprah Winfrey Show and Late Night with David Letterman. On May 3, 2006, Wallace performed his most famous stand-up bit, which was a diatribe against the young generation's obsession with allowances with the oft-cited catchphrase of \\"Get Your Mess Right.\\" While Wallace often jokes about the flippancy of modern youth culture (often citing the \\"dumb dumbs on their smart phones\\") this one joke in particular resonated with his audience, and he repeats it at every show.George Wallace Has His Mess Right . Affotd.com (2014-08-15). Retrieved on 2015-08-01. In December 2007, Wallace suffered an on-stage injury when he fell during a private-party performance at the Bellagio resort hotel and casino in Las Vegas. Wallace sued the Bellagio, claiming negligence after tripping over loose wires on stage. In April 2014, a Las Vegas jury found in favor of Wallace and awarded him US $1.3 million. After winning his case against the Bellagio, Wallace announced that he would end his 10-year run as a Las Vegas headliner to pursue other projects. \\"There are so many things to do. It's time to get into something new.\\" Personal life Wallace has had political ambitions. In 2006, he considered running for mayor of the city of Las Vegas, Nevada. Wallace stated that as mayor, he would update the Las Vegas Strip, with an easy-to-use monorail, close the strip to vehicles, and expand the road system behind the Strip hotels. He was the best man at comedian Jerry Seinfeld's wedding. Wallace's nephew, Steve Wallace, played professional football with the San Francisco 49ers and Kansas City Chiefs. Filmography Wallace has had supporting roles in a number of films, including 3 Strikes and the Coen Brothers film The Ladykillers (2004, as Sheriff Wyner). Wallace also appeared in Batman Forever (1995) as the Mayor of Gotham City. Other film credits include A Rage in Harlem (1991), The Wash (2001), Punchline (1988), Things Are Tough All Over (1982), Postcards from the Edge (1990), and Mr. Deeds (2002). He also made a brief appearance in the sitcom Scrubs episode \\"My Long Goodbye\\" (2007), and in the sitcom Seinfeld episode \\"The Checks\\", where he played the doctor that was distracted by the song \\"Witchy Woman\\". He also appeared in the introduction scene to the home video release of Jerry Seinfeld: I'm Telling You for the Last Time - Live on Broadway (1999) as a fictionalized version of himself. He portrayed a man in a retirement home in The Last Laugh (2019) on Netflix.

The species was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1767 12th edition of Systema Naturae. It is widely distributed throughout Europe, the Near East and North Africa. Description Newly emerged adults have pale green wings marked with white fascia, two on the forewing, one on the hindwing. As with most moths of this colour, the green colouration fades over time and older specimens tend to be almost pure white. The wingspan is 42‚Äì54 mm, the female generally being considerably larger than the male. Life cycle One or two broods are produced each year and adults can be seen at any time between July and September . The larva feeds on a variety of deciduous trees, including apple, beech, birch, elm, hawthorn, hazel and oak as well as several species of Prunus. The species overwinters as a larva, feeding on the soft bark of its food plants during the winter. This moth flies at night and is attracted to light. #The flight season refers to the British Isles.

The red line marks the transition of /√§ng/ \\"narrow\\" vs. /eng/ in the dialect of the Thurgau. The green line separates the /o:big/ \\"evening\\" of the Oberland from /a:big/ elsewhere. Z√ºrich German (German: Z√ºrichdeutsch, natively Z√ºrit√º√ºtsch ) is the High Alemannic dialect spoken in the Canton of Z√ºrich, Switzerland. Its area covers most of the canton, with the exception of the parts north of the Thur and the Rhine, which belong to the areal of the northeastern (Schaffhausen and Thurgau) Swiss dialects. Z√ºrich German was traditionally divided into six sub-dialects, now increasingly homogenised due to larger commuting distances: *The dialect of the town of Z√ºrich (Stadt- Mundart) *The dialect spoken around Lake Z√ºrich (See-Mundart) *The dialect of the Knonauer Amt west of the Albis (√Ñmtler Mundart) *The dialect of the area of Winterthur *The dialect of the Z√ºrcher Oberland around Lake Pf√§ffikon and the upper T√∂sstal valley *The dialect of the Z√ºrcher Unterland around B√ºlach and Dielsdorf Like all Swiss German dialects, it is essentially a spoken language, whereas the written language is standard German. Likewise, there is no official orthography of the Z√ºrich dialect. When it is written, it rarely follows the guidelines published by Eugen Dieth in his book Schwyzert√ºtschi Dial√§ktschrift. Furthermore, Dieth's spelling uses a lot of diacritical marks not found on a normal keyboard. Young people often use Swiss German for personal messages, such as when texting with their mobile phones. As they do not have a standard way of writing they tend to blend Standard German spelling with Swiss German phrasing. The Zurich dialect is generally perceived as fast spoken, less melodic than, for example, the Bernese. In the northern parts of the canton, the \\"r\\" is pronounced as a uvular trill, whereas in the city around the lake and in the southern parts, it is pronounced as an alveolar trill. Characteristic of the city dialect is that it most easily adopts external influences; in particular, the second generation Italians (secondi) have had a crucial influence, as has the English language through the media. The wave of Turkish and ex-Yugoslavian immigration of the 1990s is leaving its imprint on the dialect of the city in particular. Example The following text is an example of Z√ºrich German taken from a news article: :\\"Wi√§'s Bieler Tagblatt uf sinner√§ Online-Plattform am Namittag brichtet h√§t, sind d'Strassesperrig√§ z Biel wiedr ufghobe word√§.

It stated the streets were driveable again and the police operation had finished. On Wednesday morning, the police found a suspicious package at a construction site and shortly after, they closed off the area around the 'Bieler Spitalstrasse.'

It is a division within the Engaged Communities Group of the Department for Communities (DfC). The Public Record Office of Northern Ireland is distinguished from other archival institutions in the United Kingdom by its unique combination of private and official records. The Record Office is not the Northern Ireland equivalent or imitation of any Great Britain or Republic of Ireland archival institution. It combines the functions and responsibilities of a range of institutions: it is at the same time Public Record Office, manuscripts department of a national library, county record office for the six counties of Northern Ireland, and holder of a large range of private records. This range of remit, embracing, among others, central and local government, the churches and the private sector, is unique to Northern Ireland. History PRONI at Balmoral Avenue PRONI was established by the Public Records Act (Northern Ireland), 1923.Public Records Act (Northern Ireland) 1923. (PDF) The new body opened to the public on Monday 3 March 1924 on the fourth floor of a former linen warehouse in central Belfast (at Murray Street). The immediate challenge was to identify and preserve surrogates of records lost in Dublin during the Four Courts fire on 30 June 1922. The first Deputy Keeper, Dr David A. Chart successfully replaced many of these records by approaching solicitors, business people, politicians, churches and the landed aristocracy. The success of Chart's acquisition policy meant that PRONI needed more storage space. In April 1933, the office moved to a new central Belfast location, the first floor of the new Royal Courts of Justice in Chichester Street. However, it was not until 1965, that the Ministry of Finance would approve an actual purpose built repository. This new building, opened in 1972, at Balmoral Avenue and was the first new record office to be built in the UK since the Public Record Office in London was erected in 1838.A Brief History. Between 1924 and 1982 PRONI was part of the Ministry (later Department) of Finance. The functions were then transferred to the Department of the Environment (DOE), and in 1995, PRONI became an executive agency within the DOE. With the restoration of devolved government in 1999, PRONI became an agency within the new Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure (DCAL). The department brought together for the first time overall responsibility for libraries, museums and archives. As part of the implementation of the Review of Public Administration, PRONI ceased to be an agency in 2006 and became a division within the core department. On 9 May 2016, PRONI became a division within the Engaged Communities Group as part of the newly created Department for Communities (DfC).History of PRONI Past, Present and Future. Relocation to Titanic Quarter PRONI at Titanic Quarter In March 2011, PRONI reopened in new purpose built premises at 2 Titanic Boulevard, BT3 9HQ, in the Titanic Quarter of Belfast, approximately one mile from the city centre. The ¬£29 million new headquarters includes a larger public search room, a reading room with seats for 78 users (most of which have access to power for laptops), a wifi cafe, microfilm readers, self-service digital cameras for digital copying, electronic information points, public art integrated into the fabric of the building, lecture theatre facilities, and dedicated exhibition space. PRONI is easily accessed from Belfast City Hall via the Metro (Belfast) 26, 26A and 26B bus services. The Belfast Rapid Transport Glider Service - G2 also serves Titanic Quarter and operates daily every 10 minutes to and from Wellington Place. PRONI is in close proximity to the Titanic Quarter railway station (formerly Bridge End) and George Best Belfast City Airport. Titanic Quarter is also home to leading tourist attractions including Titanic Belfast, , , SSE Arena, Titanic Exhibition Centre and Titanic Studios (aka the Paint Hall Studios) where Game of Thrones is filmed. Current organisation =Records= Papal bull issued by Honorius III in 1219 PRONI currently holds 54 kilometres of records. These records date largely from c.1600 to the present day but a few date as far back as the early 13th century, with the oldest document being a bull of Pope Honorius III, dated 1219. Records range from public documents, such as those created by the NI government departments, to private records, such as letters or diaries. The records at PRONI relate chiefly to present day Northern Ireland. The office holds a number of records relating to other parts of the island of Ireland which have been received from private depositors and include amongst others: the Kenmare Papers of Co. Kerry; the Lissadell Papers of Co. Sligo; and Conolly Papers of Co. Kildare. =Access to records= There is no entry fee for access to records. New visitors must produce photographic proof of identity in order to register and use the research facilities. Anyone over 16 can register as a PRONI visitor. The collection at PRONI can be accessed by the electronic catalogue. Documents are ordered using the onsite ordering system in the PRONI Search Room and are produced in the PRONI Reading Room. Visitors can order up to five documents at a time. Since December 2016, PRONI has allowed visitors to copy many records using their own cameras. PRONI also provides direct access to the most up to date births, marriages and deaths database hosted by General Register Office (Northern Ireland). In September 2011, the Northern Ireland Assembly accepted a Legislative Consent Motion to reduce the time limit for release of official records from 30 years to 20 years (\\"the 20-year Rule\\"). This is underpinned by the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and the amendments made to it by the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012. The 20 Year Rule is being phased in over 10 years, with two years' worth of records being reviewed and released each year. =Online records= The PRONI website supports a number of free online resources including * PRONI electronic catalogue; * a searchable wills database which contains details of testamentary papers, 1858‚Äì1965; * valuation records, 1864‚Äì1933; * historic Ordnance Survey maps, 1832-1996; * fully indexed and searchable Ulster Covenant signatories of 1912; * Northern Ireland street directories, 1819‚Äì1900; * pre-1840 Freeholders Registers and Poll Books; * links to PRONI records on Flickr; * the Conflict Archive on the Internet (CAIN). =Events Programme= PRONI delivers a programme of events, talks, conferences, book launches and exhibitions over the course of the year.

This was the world's first practical cable car system, and Hallidie is often therefore regarded as the inventor of the cable car and father of the present day San Francisco cable car system, although both claims are open to dispute. He also introduced the manufacture of wire rope to California, and at an early age was a prolific builder of bridges in the Californian interior.  Early life  Andrew Smith Hallidie was born Andrew Smith, later adopting the name Hallidie in honor of his uncle, Sir Andrew Hallidie. His birthplace is variously quoted as London in the United Kingdom. His mother, Julia Johnstone Smith, was from Lockerbie, Dumfriesshire and his father, Andrew Smith (a prolific inventor in his own right, responsible for inventing the first box door spring, a floor cramp and had an early patent for wire rope) was born in Fleming, Dumfrieshire, Scotland, in 1798.www.sfmuseum.org Andrew Smith Hallidie At age 13 the younger Smith was initially apprenticed to a machine shop and drawing office operated by his older brother Archibald. In 1852 at age 16 father and son sailed for California, where the father had an interest in some gold mines in Mariposa County. These proved disappointing, and the father returned to England in 1853. The son, however, remained in California, and became a gold miner whilst also working as a blacksmith, surveyor and builder of bridges. In 1856, while working on the construction of a flume at a mine at American Bar, Hallidie was consulted over the rapid rate of wear on the ropes used to lower cars of rock from the mine to the mill. These ropes were wearing out in 75 days. Hallidie improvised machinery to make a replacement wire rope to his father's design, which lasted two years, and in the process began wire rope manufacture in California.  Wire rope and bridges  Hallidie abandoned mining in 1857 and returned to San Francisco. Under the name of A. S. Hallidie & Co., he commenced the manufacture of wire rope in a building at Mason and Chestnut Streets, using the machinery from American Bar. Hallidie was also heavily involved in bridge building. During 1861‚Äì2, he constructed bridges across the Klamath River at Weitchpeck, at Nevada City, across the American River at Folsom, and across the Bear, Trinity, Stanislaus, and Tuolumne rivers. In 1863 he built a bridge across the Fraser River, upstream of Yale at Alexandra in British Columbia. Also in 1863, Hallidie married Martha Elizabeth Woods. They had no children. In 1864, he became a United States citizen. In 1865, he gave up bridge building in order to devote himself entirely to his wire rope manufacturing business, which was experiencing increased demand from the silver mines on the Comstock Lode. In 1867, Hallidie invented the Hallidie ropeway, a form of aerial tramway used for transporting ore and other material across mountainous districts, which he successfully installed a number of locations, and later patented.  Cable cars  Accounts differ as to exactly how involved Hallidie was in the inception of the Clay Street Hill Railway. One version has him taking over the promotion of the line when the original promoter, Benjamin Brooks, failed to raise the necessary capital. In another version, Hallidie was the instigator, inspired by a desire to reduce the suffering incurred by the horses that hauled streetcars up Jackson Street, from Kearny to Stockton Street. There is also doubt as to when exactly the first run of the cable car occurred. The franchise required the first run no later than August 1, 1873, but at least one source reports that the run took place a day late, on August 2, although the city chose not to void the franchise. Some accounts say that the first gripman hired by Hallidie looked down the steep hill from Jones and refused to operate the car, so Hallidie took the grip himself and ran the car down the hill and up again without any problems. The named engineer of the Clay Street line was William Eppelsheimer. However, Hallidie's previous experience of cables and cable haulage systems make it likely that he contributed to the design of the system. The Clay Street line started regular service on September 1, 1873, and was a financial success. In addition, Hallidie's patents on the cable car design were stringently enforced on cable car promoters around the world and made him a rich man.  Other activities  Hallidie Plaza in San Francisco is named after Andrew Smith Hallidie Hallidie occupied many positions in San Francisco society. He served as a regent of the University of California from 1868 until his death, and as a trustee and vice-president of the San Francisco Mechanics Institute in 1864 and president from 1868 to 1877 and from 1893 to 1895. In 1873, Hallidie stood for election to the California State Senate, and in 1875 he stood for election as mayor of San Francisco, but in both cases, he was defeated. Hallidie served as a trustee of the First Unitarian Church, and as its moderator in 1883 and 1884. He held memberships in the American Society of Inventors, American Geographical Society, California Academy of Sciences, and other scientific and literary bodies. He was a member of the old California Historical Society and of the Pacific-Union, Olympic, and Sierra clubs. A. S. Hallidie & Co. became the California Wire Works in 1883 with Hallidie as president. In 1895, it was sold to Washburn and Moen Co., the oldest manufacturers of wire in the United States (established in 1831). Hallidie died on April 24, 1900, at the age of 64 of heart disease at his San Francisco residence. In San Francisco, Hallidie Plaza (near the Powell and Market Street cable car turntable) and the Hallidie Building (an office building in the city's Financial District) are named after him.

Dubner. Published on April 12, 2005, by William Morrow, the book has been described as melding pop culture with economics. By late 2009, the book had sold over 4 million copies worldwide. Overview The book is a collection of articles written by Levitt, an expert who had gained a reputation for applying economic theory to diverse subjects not usually covered by \\"traditional\\" economists. In Freakonomics, Levitt and Dubner argue that economics is, at root, the study of incentives. The book's chapters cover: * Chapter 1: Discovering cheating as applied to teachers and sumo wrestlers, as well as a typical Washington, D.C.‚Äìarea bagel business and its customers * Chapter 2: Information control as applied to the Ku Klux Klan and real-estate agents * Chapter 3: The economics of drug dealing, including the surprisingly low earnings and abject working conditions of crack cocaine dealers * Chapter 4: The role legalized abortion has played in reducing crime, contrasted with the policies and downfall of Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceau≈üescu (Levitt explored this topic in an earlier paper entitled \\"The Impact of Legalized Abortion on Crime,\\" written with John Donohue.) * Chapter 5: The negligible effects of good parenting on education * Chapter 6: The socioeconomic patterns of naming children (nominative determinism) One example of the authors' use of economic theory involves demonstrating the existence of cheating among sumo wrestlers. In a sumo tournament, all wrestlers in the top division compete in 15 matches and face demotion if they do not win at least eight of them. The sumo community is very close-knit, and the wrestlers at the top levels tend to know each other well. The authors looked at the final match, and considered the case of a wrestler with seven wins, seven losses, and one fight to go, fighting against an 8‚Äì6 wrestler. Statistically, the 7‚Äì7 wrestler should have a slightly below even chance, since the 8‚Äì6 wrestler is slightly better. However, the 7‚Äì7 wrestler actually wins around 80% of the time. Levitt uses this statistic and other data gleaned from sumo wrestling matches, along with the effect that allegations of corruption have on match results, to conclude that those who already have 8 wins collude with those who are 7‚Äì7 and let them win, since they have already secured their position for the following tournament. Despite condemnation of the claims by the Japan Sumo Association following the book's publication in 2005, the 2011 Grand Tournament in Tokyo was canceled for the first time since 1946 because of allegations of match-fixing. The authors attempt to demonstrate the power of data mining, as a number of their results emerge from Levitt's analysis of various databases. The authors posit that various incentives encourage teachers to cheat by assisting their students with multiple-choice high-stakes tests. Such cheating in the Chicago school system is inferred from detailed analysis of students' answers to multiple-choice questions. Levitt asks, \\"What would the pattern of answers look like if the teacher cheated?\\", and hypothesizes that the more difficult questions found at the end of test sections will be answered correctly more frequently than the easy questions at the beginning of test sections. =Second edition= In Chapter 2 of Freakonomics, the authors wrote of their visit to folklorist Stetson Kennedy's Florida home where the topic of Kennedy's investigations of the Ku Klux Klan were discussed. However, in their January 8, 2006, column in The New York Times Magazine, Dubner and Levitt wrote of questions about Stetson Kennedy's research (\\"Hoodwinked\\", pp. 26‚Äì28) leading to the conclusion that Kennedy's research was at times embellished for effectiveness. In the \\"Revised and Expanded Edition\\" this embellishment was noted and corrected: \\"Several months after Freakonomics was first published, it was brought to our attention that this man's portrayal of his crusade, and various other Klan matters, was considerably overstated ... we felt it was important to set straight the historical record.\\" Criticism Freakonomics has been criticized for being a work of sociology or criminology, rather than economics. Israeli economist Ariel Rubinstein criticized the book for making use of dubious statistics and complained that \\"economists like Levitt ... have swaggered off into other fields\\", saying that the \\"connection to economics ... [is] none\\" and that the book is an example of \\"academic imperialism\\". Arnold Kling has suggested the book is an example of \\"amateur sociology\\". =The impact of legalized abortion on crime= Revisiting a question first studied empirically in the 1960s, Donohue and Levitt argue that the legalization of abortion can account for almost half of the reduction in crime witnessed in the 1990s. This paper has sparked much controversy, to which Levitt has said :\\"The numbers we're talking about, in terms of crime, are absolutely trivial when you compare it to the broader debate on abortion. From a pro-life view of the world: If abortion is murder then we have a million murders a year through abortion. And the few thousand homicides that will be prevented according to our analysis are just nothing‚Äîthey are a pebble in the ocean relative to the tragedy that is abortion. So, my own view, when we [did] the study and it hasn't changed is that: our study shouldn't change anybody's opinion about whether abortion should be legal and easily available or not. It's really a study about crime, not abortion.\\" In 2003, Theodore Joyce argued that legalized abortion had little impact on crime, contradicting Donohue and Levitt's results (\\"Did Legalized Abortion Lower Crime?\\" Journal of Human Resources, 2003, 38(1), pp. 1‚Äì37). In 2004, the authors published a response, in which they argued that Joyce's argument was flawed due to omitted-variable bias. In November 2005, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston economist Christopher Foote and his research assistant Christopher Goetz published a working paper, in which they argued that the results in Donohue and Levitt's abortion and crime paper were due to statistical errors made by the authors: the omission of state-year interactions and the use of the total number of arrests instead of the arrest rate in explaining changes in the murder rate. When the corrections were made, Foote and Goetz argued that abortion actually increased violent crime instead of decreasing it and did not affect property crime. They even concluded that the majority of women who had abortions in the 1970s were middle class whites rather than low income minorities as Levitt stated; this was, they stated, because white middle-class women had the financial means for an abortion. The Economist remarked on the news of the errors that \\"for someone of Mr Levitt's iconoclasm and ingenuity, technical ineptitude is a much graver charge than moral turpitude. To be politically incorrect is one thing; to be simply incorrect quite another.\\" In January 2006, Donohue and Levitt published a response, in which they admitted the errors in their original paper but also pointed out Foote and Goetz's correction was flawed due to heavy attenuation bias. The authors argued that, after making necessary changes to fix the original errors, the corrected link between abortion and crime was now weaker but still statistically significant, contrary to Foote and Goetz's claims. Foote and Goetz, however, soon produced a rebuttal of their own and said that even after analyzing the data using the methods that Levitt and Donohue recommend, the data does not show a positive correlation between abortion rates and crime rates. They are quick to point out that this does not necessarily disprove Levitt's thesis, however, and emphasize that with data this messy and incomplete, it is in all likelihood not even possible to prove or disprove Donohue and Levitt's conclusion. Freakonomics commented on the effects of an abortion ban in Romania (Decree 770), stating that \\"Compared to Romanian children born just a year earlier, the cohort of children born after the abortion ban would do worse in every measurable way: they would test lower in school, they would have less success in the labor market, and they would also prove much more likely to become criminals. (p. 118)\\". John DiNardo, a professor at the University of Michigan, retorts that the paper cited by Freakonomics states \\"virtually the opposite of what is actually claimed\\": Levitt responded on the Freakonomics Blog that Freakonomics and Pop-Eleches \\"are saying the same thing\\": =Effects of extra police on crime= Freakonomics claimed that it was possible to \\"tease out\\" the effect of extra police on crime by analyzing electoral cycles. The evidence behind these claims was shown to be due partly to a programming error. McCrary stated \\"While municipal police force size does appear to vary over state and local electoral cycles ... elections do not induce enough variation in police hiring to generate informative estimates of the effect of police on crime.\\" =Defamation case= On April 10, 2006, John Lott filed suit for defamation against Steven Levitt and HarperCollins Publishers over the book and against Levitt over a series of emails to retired economist John B. McCall. In the book Freakonomics, Levitt and coauthor Stephen J. Dubner claimed that the results of Lott's research in More Guns, Less Crime had not been replicated by other academics. In the emails to McCall, who had pointed to a number of papers in different academic publications that had replicated Lott's work, Levitt wrote that the work by authors supporting Lott in a special 2001 issue of The Journal of Law and Economics had not been peer-reviewed, alleged that Lott had paid the University of Chicago Press to publish the papers, and that papers with results opposite of Lott's had been blocked from publication in that issue. A federal judge found that Levitt's replication claim in Freakonomics was not defamation but found merit in Lott's complaint about the email claims.\\"Judge Castillo issues a decision on Lott v. Levitt\\" on John Lott's website Levitt settled the second defamation claim by admitting in a letter to John B. McCall that he himself was a peer reviewer in the 2001 issue of The Journal of Law and Economics, that Lott had not engaged in bribery (paying for extra costs of printing and postage for a conference issue is customary), and that he knew that \\"scholars with varying opinions\\" (including Levitt himself) had been invited to participate. The Chronicle of Higher Education characterized Levitt's letter as offering \\"a doozy of a concession\\". The dismissal of the first half of Lott's suit was unanimously upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit on February 11, 2009.\\"7th Circuit Affirmation of District Court Dismissal of Defamation Lawsuit \\" Publishing history Freakonomics peaked at number two among nonfiction on The New York Times Best Seller list and was named the 2006 Book Sense Book of the Year in the Adult Nonfiction category. The book received positive reviews from critics. The review aggregator Metacritic reported the book had an average score of 67 out of 100, based on 16 reviews. Freakonomics has a social review score 69/100 on Panjury. Screen shot of Freakonomics Blog The success of the book has been partly attributed to the blogosphere. In the campaign prior to the release of the book in April 2005, publisher (William Morrow and Company) chose to target bloggers in an unusually strategic way, sending galley copies to over a hundred of them, as well as contracting two specialized buzz marketing agencies. In 2006, the Revised and Expanded Edition of the book was published, with the most significant corrections in the second chapter. Progression =Freakonomics blog= The authors started their own Freakonomics blog in 2005. In May 2007, writer and blogger Melissa Lafsky was hired as the full-time editor of the site. In August 2007, the blog was incorporated into The New York Times web site ‚Äì the authors had been writing joint columns for The New York Times Magazine since 2004 ‚Äì and the domain Freakonomics.com became a redirect there. In March 2008, Annika Mengisen replaced Lafsky as the blog editor. The Freakonomics blog ended its association with The New York Times on March 1, 2011. Among the recurrent guest bloggers on the Freakonomics blog are Ian Ayres, Daniel Hamermesh, Eric A. Morris, Sudhir Venkatesh, Justin Wolfers and others. In 2008, Stephen Dubner asked for questions from the site's readers and then featured them in an extended Q&A; on \\"Best Places to Live\\" with demographics expert Bert Sperling. =SuperFreakonomics= In April 2007, co-author Stephen Dubner announced that there would be a sequel to Freakonomics, and that it would contain further writings about street gang culture from Sudhir Venkatesh, as well as a study of the use of money by capuchin monkeys. Dubner said the title would be SuperFreakonomics, and that one topic would be what makes people good at what they do. The book was released in Europe in early October 2009 and in the United States on October 20, 2009. =Freakonomics radio= In September 2010, Marketplace radio announced the creation of a Freakonomics podcast hosted by Dubner and Levitt. It is available on iTunes and is aired bi-weekly on NPR. =Film adaptation= In 2010, Chad Troutwine, Chris Romano, and Dan O'Meara produced a documentary film adaptation with a budget of nearly US$3 million in an omnibus format by directors Seth Gordon, Morgan Spurlock, Alex Gibney, Eugene Jarecki, Rachel Grady, and Heidi Ewing. It was the Closing Night Gala premiere film at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 30, 2010. It was also the Opening Night film at the AFI/Discovery SilverDocs film festival on June 21, 2010. Magnolia Pictures acquired distribution rights for a Fall 2010 release. Freakonomics: The Movie was released in major cities with a pay what you want pricing offer for selected preview showings. No report of the results has yet been published. =Freakonomics Consulting Group= In 2009, Steven Levitt co-founded Freakonomics Consulting Group, a business and philanthropy consulting company which became The Greatest Good and is now known as TGG Group. Founding partners include Nobel laureates Daniel Kahneman and Gary Becker, as well as several other prominent economists.

At Tokyo Disneyland, this land is named Toontown. A similar land existed at the Magic Kingdom until 2011 and was named Mickey's Toontown Fair. Walt Disney Studios Park in Disneyland Paris has a related land called Toon Studio. The attraction is a small-scale recreation of the Mickey Mouse universe where visitors can meet the characters and visit their homes which are constructed in a cartoonish style. It was inspired by \\"Toontown\\" from the 1988 film Who Framed Roger Rabbit in which cartoon characters live apart from humans. History and concept Roger Rabbit was recognized as a lucrative character by Disney after the release of Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and a set of attractions based on the movie was developed for Disney theme parks. Roger Rabbit was set to be the star of his own land, behind Main Street, U.S.A. at Disneyland, called Hollywoodland. Meanwhile, at the Magic Kingdom, a new land behind Fantasyland was being developed in honor of Mickey Mouse's sixtieth birthday, aptly named Mickey's Birthdayland. There were also set to be attractions based on Roger Rabbit, Judge Doom, and Baby Herman opening in a major expansion at the Disney's Hollywood Studios and Tokyo Disneyland, but after the financial troubles of the Euro Disney Resort, plans were cut back. Hollywoodland was combined with the concept of Mickey's Birthdayland, as well as a concept found in Who Framed Roger Rabbit, to form Mickey's Toontown, which opened in 1993 behind Fantasyland at Disneyland. The attractions at Disney-MGM Studios were canceled, but an exact replica of Mickey's Toontown opened at Tokyo Disneyland in 1996. Disneyland Paris features a similar 'Toon Studio' in its Walt Disney Studios Park. Walt Disney World, Hong Kong Disneyland, and Shanghai Disneyland are the only Disney resorts to have neither a Toontown or Toon Studio. Magic Kingdom Minnie's Country House At the Magic Kingdom, Mickey's Toontown Fair (now Storybook Circus) initially opened as Mickey's Birthdayland on June 18, 1988. It became Mickey's Starland on May 26, 1990, and was briefly renamed Mickey's Toyland in late 1995.Mickey's Toontown Fair Train Station at Yesterland. Yesterland.com. Retrieved on September 6, 2013. The land was closed in early 1996 for an extensive refurbishment, and on October 1, 1996, it reopened as Mickey's Toontown Fair for the park's 25th anniversary. Its storyline portrayed the land as the vacation home for the characters who reside at Mickey's Toontown in California. Mickey's Toontown Fair was closed on February 11, 2011 in order to build the \\"New Fantasyland\\" expansion. Some elements of Mickey's Toontown Fair have been demolished and others have been re-themed to a new Storybook Circus area. The Dumbo the Flying Elephant ride was removed from Fantasyland and rebuilt in Storybook Circus, the new version doubling the capacity of the old ride and incorporating an interactive queue. The Barnstormer at Goofy's Wiseacre Farm has been re-themed to The Barnstormer featuring Goofy as the Great Goofini. The first half of Storybook Circus opened on March 12, 2012, which included the newly themed \\"The Great Goofini\\", the Storybook Circus train station which was completely rebuilt and also one half of the new Dumbo ride. The second phase of Storybook Circus, including the second half of Dumbo, the indoor queue area, and the Casey Jr Splash 'n' Soak Station opened in July 2012. =Former attractions and entertainment= * The Barnstormer at Goofy's Wiseacre Farm (rethemed as The Great Goofini's Barnstormer) * Donald's Boat (replaced by queue for The Great Goofini's Barnstormer) * Judge's Tent (replaced by a fast-pass area and sitting area) * Mickey's Country House * Minnie's Country House (replaced by a pathway from Storybook Circus to Fantasy Forest) * Pixie Hollow (replaced by Pete's Silly Sideshow) * Toontown Hall of Fame (replaced by Pete's Silly Sideshow) * Walt Disney World Railroad - Mickey's Toontown Fair Station (replaced by Walt Disney World Railroad - Fantasyland Station) =Former shops= * Cornelius Coot's County Bounty * Mickey's Toontown Fair Souvenirs * Toontown Farmer's Market Disneyland 250x250px Mickey's Toontown opened in Disneyland on January 24, 1993.Mickey's Toontown - Disneyland Park California.

The Dendera light is a motif carved as a set of stone reliefs in the Hathor temple at Dendera in Egypt, which superficially resemble modern electric lighting devices. A fringe hypothesis suggests that the Dendera light depicts advanced electrical technology possessed by the ancient Egyptians; mainstream Egyptologists however view the carvings as representing a typical set of symbolic images from Egyptian mythology. These depict a djed pillar and a lotus flower spawning a snake inside it, symbols of stability and fertility, respectively. Mainstream interpretation The view of Egyptologists is that the relief is a mythological depiction of a djed pillar and a lotus flower (Nymphaea caerulea), spawning a snake within, representing aspects of Egyptian mythology.Wolfgang Waitkus, Die Texte in den unteren Krypten des Hathortempels von Dendera: ihre Aussagen zur Funktion und Bedeutung dieser R√§ume, Mainz 1997 (tr., The texts in the lower crypts of the Hathor temples of Dendera: their statements for the function and meaning of these areas) \\"Dendera Temple Crypt \\". iafrica.com. The djed pillar is a symbol of stability which is also interpreted as the backbone of the god Osiris. In the carvings the four horizontal lines forming the capital of the djed are supplemented by human arms stretching out, as if the djed were a backbone. The arms hold up the snake within the lotus flower. The snakes coming from the lotus symbolize fertility, linked to the annual Nile flood. Fringe interpretation In contrast to the mainstream interpretation, a fringe hypothesis proposes that the reliefs depict ancient Egyptian electrical technology, based on comparison to similar modern devices (such as Geissler tubes, Crookes tubes, and arc lamps). J. N. Lockyer's passing reference to a colleague's humorous suggestion that electric lamps would explain the absence of lampblack deposits in the tombs has sometimes been forwarded as an argument supporting this particular interpretation (another argument being made is the use of a system of reflective mirrors). Proponents of this interpretation have also used a text referring to \\"high poles covered with copper plates\\" to argue this,Bruno Kolbe, Francis ed Legge, Joseph Skellon, tr., \\"An Introduction to Electricity\\". Kegan Paul, Trench, Tr√ºbner, 1908. 429 pages. Page 391. (cf., \\"[...] high poles covered with copper plates and with gilded tops were erected 'to break the stones coming from on high'. J. D√ºmichen, Baugeschichte des Dendera-Tempels, Strassburg, 1877\\") but Bolko Stern has written in detail explaining why the copper-covered tops of poles (which were lower than the associated pylons) do not relate to electricity or lightning, pointing out that no evidence of anything used to manipulate electricity had been found in Egypt and that this was a magical and not a technical installation. Archaeologist and debunker Kenneth Feder argued that if ancient Egyptians really had such advanced technology, some light bulb remains (glass shards, metal sockets, filaments...) should have been discovered during archaeological excavations. By applying the Occam's razor, he instead highlighted the feasibility of the aforementioned reflective mirrors system, and also that the notion of adding salt to torches to minimize lampblack was well known by ancient Egyptians., pp.225‚Äì7  See also  * Out-of-place artifact * Baghdad Battery * Helicopter hieroglyphs References External links * The Dendera Reliefs, Catchpenny Mysteries. * Frank D√∂rnenburg, Electric lights in Egypt?. 2004.

In the scriptures of the Abrahamic religions, God is described as being a personal creator, speaking in the first person and showing emotion such as anger and pride, and sometimes appearing in anthropomorphic shape.Williams, W. Wesley, \\"A study of anthropomorphic theophany and Visio Dei in the Hebrew Bible, the Quran and early Sunni Islam\\", University of Michigan, March 2009 In the Pentateuch, for example, God talks with and instructs his prophets and is conceived as possessing volition, emotions (such as anger, grief and happiness), intention, and other attributes characteristic of a human person. Personal relationships with God may be described in the same ways as human relationships, such as a Father, as in Christianity, or a Friend as in Sufism.\\"The man who realizes God as a friend is never lonely in the world, neither in this world nor in the hereafter. There is always a friend, a friend in the crowd, a friend in the solitude; or while he is asleep, unconscious of this outer world, and when he is awake and conscious of it. In both cases the friend is there in his thought, in his imagination, in his heart, in his soul.\\" Inayat Khan, quoted from The Sufi Message of Hazrat Inayat Khan A 2019 survey by the Pew Research Center reported that, of U.S. adults, 70% view that \\"God is a person with whom people can have a relationship,\\" while 15% believe that \\"God is an impersonal force.\\" A 2019 survey by the National Opinion Research Center reports that 77.5% of U.S. adults believe in a personal god. The 2014 Religious Landscape survey conducted by Pew reported that 77% of U.S. adults believe in a personal god. Views =Abrahamic religions= Bah√° º√≠ Faith In the Bah√° º√≠ Faith God is described as \\"a personal God, unknowable, inaccessible, the source of all Revelation, eternal, omniscient, omnipresent and almighty\\". Although transcendent and inaccessible directly, his image is reflected in his creation. The purpose of creation is for the created to have the capacity to know and love its creator. God communicates his will and purpose to humanity through intermediaries, known as Manifestations of God, who are the prophets and messengers that have founded religions from prehistoric times up to the present day. Christianity In the case of the Christian belief in the Trinity, whether the Holy Spirit is impersonal or personal, is the subject of dispute, with experts in pneumatology debating the matter. Jesus (or God the Son) and God the Father are believed to be two persons or aspects of the same god. Jesus is of the same ousia or substance as God the Father, manifested in three hypostases or persons (the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit). Nontrinitarian Christians dispute that Jesus is a \\"hypostasis\\" or person of God. Islam Most Islamic sources teach that God is a personal God; he speaks in the Quran in first person and has personal attributes, yet the Quran still maintains that God is unique in nature and substance and has no similarity to anything else.Quran,112 Surat al ikhlas Islam also teaches that God is beyond comprehension, and the best way for Muslims to have a relationship of God is to obey his commands.Norcliffe (1999), p.32-33 The Quran asserts the existence of a single and absolute truth that transcends the world: a unique and indivisible being who is independent of the entire creation.Vincent J. Cornell, Encyclopedia of Religion, Vol 5, pp.3561-3562 The Quran clearly opposes conceiving God as resembling \\"the creation\\" and it maintains that whatever image a believer has of God is not God, and that he is truly transcendental. According to the Quran: > \\"Say: He is God, the One and Only; God, the Eternal, Absolute; He begetteth > not, nor is He begotten; And there is none like unto Him.\\" (Sura , Suraah > Ikhlaas) > Thy Lord is self-sufficient, full of Mercy: if it were God's will, God could > destroy you, and in your place appoint whom God will as your successors, > even as God raised you up from the posterity of other people.\\" (Sura , Yusuf > Ali) Judaism Jewish theology states that God is not a person. However, there exist frequent references to anthropomorphic characteristics of God in the Hebrew Bible such as the \\"Hand of God.\\" Judaism holds that these are to be taken only as figures of speech. Their purpose is to make God more comprehensible to the human reader. As God is beyond human understanding, there are different ways of describing him. He is said to be both personal and impersonal; he has a relationship with his creation but is beyond all relationships. =Deism= In general, most deists view God as a personal god. This is illustrated by the 17th-century assertions of Lord Edward Herbert, universally regarded as the Father of English Deism, which stated that there is one Supreme God, and he ought to be worshipped. However, deism is a general belief encompassing people with varying specific beliefs, and the notion of God as a personal god cannot be ascribed to all deists. Christian Christian deism is a term applied both to Christians who incorporate deistic principles into their beliefs and to deists who follow the moral teachings of Jesus without believing in his divinity. With regard to those who are essentially deists who follow the moral teachings of Jesus, these are a subset of classical deists. Consequently, they believe in a personal God, but they do not necessarily believe in a personal relationship with God. Classical Classical deists who adhere to Herbert's common notion certainly believe in a personal God because those notions include the belief that God dispenses rewards and punishments both in this life and after it. This is not something which would be done by an impersonal force. However, a personal relationship with God is not contemplated, since living a virtuous and pious life is seen as the primary means of worshiping God. Humanist Humanist deists accept the core principles of deism but incorporate humanist beliefs into their faith. Thus, humanistic deists believe in a personal God who created the universe. The key element that separates humanistic deists from other deists is the emphasis on the importance of human development over religious development and on the relationships among human beings over the relationships between humans and God. Those who self-identify as humanistic deists may take an approach based upon what is found in classical deism and allow their worship of God to manifest itself primarily (or exclusively) in the manner in which they treat others. Other humanistic deists may prioritize their relationships with other human beings over their relationship with God, yet still maintain a personal relationship with the Supreme Being. Pandeism Pandeists believe that in the process of creating the universe, God underwent a metamorphosis from a conscious and sentient being or force to an unconscious and unresponsive entity by becoming the universe. Consequently, pandeists do not believe that a personal god currently exists. Polydeism Polydeists reject the notion that one Supreme Being would have created the universe and then left it to its own devices which is a common belief shared by many deists. Rather, they conclude that several gods who are superhuman but not omnipotent each created parts of the universe. Polydeists hold an affirmative belief that the gods who created the universe are completely uninvolved in the world and pose no threat and offer no hope to humanity. Polydeists see living virtuous and pious lives as the primary components of worshiping God, firmly adhering to one of the common notions set forth by Herbert. Thus, polydeists believe that there are several personal Gods. Yet, they do not believe they can have a relationship with any of them. Scientific Scientific deists believe, based on an analysis utilizing the scientific method, that a personal God created the universe. This analysis finds no evidence of a purpose God may have had for creation of the universe or evidence that God attempted to communicate such purpose to humanity. It therefore concludes that there is no purpose to creation other than that which human beings choose to make for themselves. Thus, scientific deists believe in a personal God, but generally do not believe in relationships between God and human beings, since there is no proof of a purpose for creation. Spiritual Spiritual deism is a belief in the core principles of deism with an emphasis on spirituality including the connections between humans and each other, nature and God. Within spiritual deism, there is an absolute belief in a personal God as the creator of the universe along with the ability to build a spiritual relationship with God. While Spiritual deism is nondogmatic, its followers generally believe that there can be no progress for mankind without a belief in a personal God. =Indian religions= Hinduism Vaishnavism and Shaivism, traditions of Hinduism, subscribe to an ultimate personal nature of God. The Vishnu Sahasranama declares the person of Vishnu as both the Paramatma (supreme soul) and Parameshwara (supreme God) while the Rudram describes the same about Shiva. In Krishna- centered theology (Krishna is seen as a form of Vishnu by most, except Gaudiya Vaishnavism) the title Svayam Bhagavan is used exclusively to designate Krishna in his personal feature, it refers to Gaudiya Vaishnava, the Nimbarka Sampradaya and followers of Vallabha, while the person of Vishnu and Narayana is sometimes referred to as the ultimate personal god of other Vaishnava traditions.  Jainism  Jainism explicitly denies existence of non- personal transcendent god and explicitly affirms existence of personal gods. All gods in Jainism are personal. One of the major point of dispute between Digambara and Shwetambara is the gender of the gods. Digambara gods can only be men, and any man of at least eight years of age can become god if he follows the right procedure. Jain gods are eternal, but they are not beginningless. Also, Jain gods are all omniscient, but not omnipotent. They are sometimes called quasi-gods due to this reason. Gods are said to be free from the following eighteen imperfections: # janma ‚Äì (re)birth; # jarƒÅ ‚Äì old- age; # tri≈õƒÅ ‚Äì thirst; # k≈õudhƒÅ ‚Äì hunger; # vismaya ‚Äì astonishment; # arati ‚Äì displeasure; # kheda ‚Äì regret; # roga ‚Äì sickness; # ≈õoka ‚Äì grief; # mada ‚Äì pride; # moha ‚Äì delusion; # bhaya ‚Äì fear; # nidrƒÅ ‚Äì sleep; # cintƒÅ ‚Äì anxiety; # sveda ‚Äì perspiration; # rƒÅga ‚Äì attachment; # dve≈õa ‚Äì aversion; and # mara≈Üa ‚Äì death. The four infinitudes of god are (ananta cƒÅtu·π£·π≠aya) are: # ananta j√±ƒÅna, infinite knowledge # ananta dar≈õana, perfect perception due to the destruction of all dar≈õanƒÅvara·πáƒ´ya karmas # ananta sukha, infinite bliss # ananta vƒ´rya ‚Äì infinite energy Those who re-establish the Jain faith are called Tirthankaras. They have additional attributes. Tirthankaras revitalize the sangha, the fourfold order consisting of male saints (sƒÅdhus), female saints (sƒÅdhvis), male householders (≈õrƒÅvaka) and female householders (≈örƒÅvika). The first Tirthankara of the current time cycle was ·πö·π£abhanƒÅtha, and the twenty-fourth and last Tirthankara was Mahavira, who lived from 599 BCE to 527 BCE. Jain texts mention forty-six attributes of arihants or tirthankaras. These attributes comprise four infinitudes (ananta chatushtaya), thirty-four miraculous happenings (ati≈õaya), and eight splendours (prƒÅtihƒÅrya). The eight splendours (prƒÅtihƒÅrya) are: # a≈õokavrik≈õa ‚Äì the Ashoka tree; # si·πÉhƒÅsana‚Äì bejeweled throne; # chatra ‚Äì three-tier canopy; # bhƒÅmadal ‚Äì halo of unmatched luminance; # divya dhvani ‚Äì divine voice of the Lord without lip movement; # pu≈õpavar≈õƒÅ ‚Äì shower of fragrant flowers; # camara ‚Äì waving of sixty-four majestic hand-fans; and # dundubhi ‚Äì dulcet sound of kettle-drums and other musical instruments. At the time of nirvana (final release), the arihant sheds off the remaining four aghati karmas: # Nama (physical structure forming) Karma # Gotra (status forming) Karma, # Vedniya (pain and pleasure causing) Karma, # Ayushya (life span determining) Karma. And float at the top of the universe without losing their individuality and with the same shape and size as the body at the time of release.

The Beechcraft 60 Duke is an American-built twin-engine fixed-wing aircraft created by Beechcraft. The aircraft has retractable tricycle landing gear and a pressurized cabin. The two piston engines are turbocharged and the turbochargers also pressurize the cabin with bleed air. Design The development of the Beechcraft 60 began in early 1965, and it was designed to fill the gap between the Beechcraft Baron and the Beechcraft Queen Air. On December 29, 1966, the prototype made its first flight. On February 1, 1968, the FAA issued the type certificate.Taylor 1976, p.216. Distribution to customers began in July 1968. The passenger cabin is fitted with club seating and entry is by means of a port-side airstair entry door in the rear fuselage.Simpson, 2001, p. 85 The Beechcraft A60, which came onto the market in 1970, represented an advancement over the Baron, with an improved pressurized cabin utilizing advanced bonded honeycomb construction, lighter and more efficient turbochargers, and improved elevators. The last variant, the B60, was introduced in 1974. The interior arrangement was renewed and the engine efficiency again increased by improved turbochargers. The Beechcraft 60 was, despite its very good performance, only a moderate seller, principally because the complicated technology demanded a high expenditure on maintenance. Production was stopped in 1983. Most of the Duke B-60s still flying have retained their original equipment. Electro-mechanical systems, which were highly advanced when the aircraft was introduced, were superseded in other aircraft with simpler I/C controlled mechanical parts. The aircraft design uses turbocharged Lycoming TIO541-B4 engines that develop 380 hp each. Other systems, parts, and FAA certified technicians are increasingly difficult to locate. Normally, pilots figure 45 gallons per hour, plus another 40 gallons for each takeoff and climb as typical fuel consumption for cross country planning. Owners compare the Beechcraft B60 to classic sports cars‚Äînoting that they do not fly Dukes to economize. One area of particular maintenance concern involves the original construction of the tail section from a magnesium alloy, making that section of the airframe a common and expensive target of corrosion if not detected and treated quickly. =Modifications= Rocket Engineering Duke conversion Some Dukes have been modified by Rocket Engineering of Spokane, Washington, replacing the Lycoming reciprocating engines with Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-21 or -35 turbine engines. Called the Royal Turbine Duke conversion, the modification increases fuel capacity by 28 gallons and the maximum useful load by 400 pounds. The take-off length required is shortened by over 1,500 feet to only 1,000 feet and the landing distance is reduced by over 2,000 feet to only 900. The maximum rate of climb is increased from 1,600 feet per minute to 4,000 feet per minute, reducing the time to climb to 25,000 feet from 25 minutes to 9 minutes. The cruise speed is increased to 290 knots at 29,000 feet. The modification does have some disadvantages as it increases fuel burn from 56 gallons per hour to 66 and lowers the certified ceiling from 30,000 feet to 28,000. The supplemental type certificate was issued on 2006-05-12. Operation Beech A60 Duke in 1986 The Duke was purchased by corporate and private pilot owners. Most were registered in the United States but examples were exported to many countries including Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Croatia, Finland, France, Germany, Honduras, Iceland, Serbia, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, South Africa and the United Kingdom. One Duke was flown by the Jamaica Defense Force. Many remain in service in the early twenty-first century. In reviewing the aircraft in 2008, Rick Durden of AVweb stated, \\"Built to the quality standards of a King Air, the six-place Duke sported 380-hp, Lycoming TIO-541 engines ‚Äì rare beasts, those ‚Äì which means when both come due for overhaul, the choice is the overhaul or buying a small house in the Midwest. The assertive lines of the airframe made for a startlingly attractive airplane, but led to high costs of manufacture and, surprising to the casual onlooker, horrendous drag. There are those who claim that the Duke was purposefully designed to be about 30 knots slower than it could easily have been on the available power simply because otherwise it would have been faster than the flagship of the Beech line, the King Air. The roughly 230-knot max. cruise speed is only marginally less than that of a King Air 90 and about the same as a Cessna 421, which carries more on slightly less horsepower. While the Duke shares the delightful handling of the Beech line, should pilots have the joy of single-engine operation, they will be up against the highest rudder-force of any piston twin ‚Äì 150 pounds at Vmc ‚Äì which happens to be the maximum the FAA allows. Owners report buying a Duke partially because of its looks, but selling it because of the cost of keeping it running. They describe King Air maintenance costs in a piston-twin airframe and recognize that the value of the airplane is entirely dependent on the engines. A gear-up landing means an engine teardown and propeller replacement, along with some sheet metal work. The cost is so high in relation to the value of the airframe that, in many cases, the insurance company will consider the airplane a total loss.\\" Production figures Simpson, 2005, p. 50 * Beechcraft 60 : 125 * Beechcraft A60 : 121 * Beechcraft B60: 350 Specifications (B60) Operators =Military operators= ; ; : Jamaica Defence ForceWheeler Flight International August 4, 1979, p. 362.

St. Michaelis is a landmark of the city and it is considered to be one of the finest Hanseatic Protestant baroque churches. The church was purposely built Protestant unlike many other Hamburg churches which were originally built by Roman Catholics and were converted to Protestantism during the Reformation. It is dedicated to the Archangel Michael. A large bronze statue, standing above the portal of the church shows the archangel conquering the devil. The 132-meter high Baroque spire totally covered with copper is a prominent feature of Hamburg's skyline and has always been a landfall mark for ships sailing up the river Elbe. History St. Michael's Victory over the Devil, sculpture above the main entrance St. Michael's Church, Hamburg The present church building is the third one at this site. The first one was built from 1647 to 1669. It became the church of the new town (Neustadt), which was created in 1625 inside the new city walls, and which grew steadily since. In 1687, the Michel became the fifth chapter church (Hauptkirche), as the new town (Neustadt) became a parish. That church was destroyed on March 10, 1750, by a lightning strike. The original church has been replicated and built in 9 different cities around the world. In 1786, a new construction following the design of and was completed. This is the church as we know it today. It was reconstructed twice in the 20th century: after catching fire in 1906 during construction work and after the bombings of 1944 and 1945. After the 1906 fire, the photos of Wilhelm Weimar were used to help recreate the church. Since 1983, renovation is ongoing: first the spire and then the roof. The composer and pianist Johannes Brahms was baptized on May 26, 1833 in this church and confirmed at the age of fifteen by Pastor von Ahlsen, who had married Brahms's parents. Architecture South facade Interior The baroque pulpit and altar of St. Michael's Church Aerial photo from about 1920 Offering 2,500 seats, the Michel is the largest church in Hamburg. The church has a Latin cross plan with 44 m width, 52 m length and 27 m height. The clock tower is a significant feature of the city skyline and was a navigation aid for ships sailing on the river Elbe. The clock features an observation level which allows a panoramic view of the city and harbour. The clock tower features four clock faces and are the largest clock faces in Germany. The minute hands are and the hour hands are .Michel kompakt, Hauptkirche St. Michaelis, HamburgMichel-Uhr: 40 Zentimeter pro Minute, www.evangelisch.de (Gemeinschaftswerks der Evangelischen Publizistik (GEP) gGmbH, Frankfurt am Main The church has five organs including a Marcussen organ and a large Steinmeyer organ with its 85 registers, 5 manuals and 6674 pipes. On 9 October 2008, St. Michael's received a new crypt organ, named after Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy. The pulpit is in the center of the building which was crafted out of marble by sculptor Otto Lessing from Dresden in 1910. It was designed to look like a rounded chalice and features a magnificent staircase. The large pulpit roof is crowned by the Angel of Annunciation. Made from white marble, the baptismal font was crafted in Livorno in 1763 and donated by Hamburg merchants who lived there at that time. The baptismal font is reminiscent of a seashell and supported by three baptism angels. The altar is 20 meters tall and was built from costly marble in 1910. The altar features three sections illustrating key scenes from the life of Jesus Christ. The central image portrays the Resurrection of Jesus and, below it, a relief depicts the Last Supper. Above the central image, there is a large crucifix. Located at the very top, the altar crown takes the form of a dove as a symbol of the Holy Spirit and is surrounded by a radiant circle. To the right and left of the radiant circle, two angels are kneeling and bowing their heads. Crypt In the church crypt, there are 2,425 people interred, including Johann Mattheson and Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach. The grave chambers are deeply excavated for four coffins above the other. During the French occupation of Hamburg in 1813, burials were banned within the city and therefore also in the crypt. In 2004, some of the graves were opened and documented by scientists. In the process, they found some less well-preserved coffins and several intact coffins containing skeletal remains and well-preserved garments and textile upholstery. In the 18th and 19th centuries, wealthy families in Hamburg, fraternities, government offices and those with the benefit of burial funds acquired graves here. Well-preserved coffin carts can still be found in the crypt today. In the days when people were still buried in the crypt, the carts were used to transport the coffins. During the Second World War, the crypt was used as a shelter. In early 2000, the crypt was renovated and is now used for church services and concerts.

She co-founded and was the first Prioress General of the Congregation of Dominican Missionary Sisters of the Rosary, which she helped to found in Peru. Life =Background= She was born Florentina Nicol y Go√±i on 14 March 1868 in Tafalla, Navarre, the youngest of the four daughters of Juan Nicol y Zalduendo, a shopkeeper specializing in farming items, and of √Ågueda Go√±i y Vidal, who died in 1872. As a child, she had many duties, including helping her family with the household chores. In 1878 a cousin of her father, who was a cloistered Carmelite nun, offered to educate his middle two daughters at the boarding school of her monastery, the oldest having already married. Agreeing, he sent the girls to study. They later entered the monastic community themselves as Carmelite nuns. In December 1881 Nicol was enrolled by her father at the boarding school of the Beaterio (Convent) of Santa Rosa in Huesca, a religious community of cloistered Sisters of the Third Order of St. Dominic, which was considered a prestigious school in the region. It was there that she was able to experience for herself the religious life, which raised questions in her mind about her future. Her father and stepmother withdrew her from the school in February 1883, considering that she had received sufficient education for a female. During that time, however, she had felt called to join the Dominican Sisters who had taught her, but she returned home to reflect on her choices. By the following October Nicol had received the permission of her father to enter the convent. He then took her back to Huesca, where they visited her two sisters who were Carmelite nuns, after which she entered the novitiate of the beaterio. In 1886 she professed religious vows, taking the religious name of Mary Ascension of the Sacred Heart. She then became a teacher at that school and served in that capacity for the next 27 years. Under the anti-clerical laws promulgated in the early 20th century, however, the Spanish government took over the school and expelled the Sisters in 1913. Deprived of their traditional ministry, the Sisters decided to act on a proposal they had long considered, namely, missionary service, about which they had learned from the periodicals issued by various missionary congregations. They wrote to ecclesiastical authorities in both America and the Philippines, seeking a field where they could help the poorest of the poor. The response came from the friar Ram√≥n Zubieta, a former missionary in the Philippines who had just been appointed by the Holy See as the Apostolic Vicar of a new Vicariate in the Peruvian amazons. The friar had traveled to Rome for his consecration as a bishop. After his stay in Rome, he stopped in Huesca to speak with the Sisters to see if he would be able to get some of the community to help in his new responsibility. Five of the Sisters who volunteered for this mission were chosen, and Nicol was chosen to lead them. =New horizons= The five Dominican Sisters left Huesca during November 1913, accompanied by the bishop and three other friars who were to serve his territory, landing in Peru at the Port of Callao on 30 December 1913. When they arrived in Lima, they were given hospitality by the Dominican Sisters of the convent at the Shrine of Our Lady of the Patronage (), of which they took possession the following year. After a two-year period of cultural acclimation and preparation for the mission, Nicol set off in 1915 with two other Sisters for their final destination in the mountain forests. After a journey of 24 days crossing the Andes to a region where white women had never before traveled, they arrived in Puerto Maldonado, a small village in the Amazon basin, situated between two large rivers, the Madre de Dios and the Tambopata, along which all communication took place. Within three days of their arrival, the Sisters began teaching the girls of the region and started the construction of a school. Soon girls from the indigenous Baraya tribe starting coming from the forest to receive the education they offered. Nicol made it clear that they would be welcome in their classrooms. This was despite the hostility of the white plantation workers who formed the population of the town. The lack of any organized health care led the poor and the sick to come to the Sisters for care. The Sisters responded to this need, caring for them in their own convent, when necessary. They began to visit the sick in their homes, and provide whatever rudimentary care they could. Eventually, the Sisters would expand into medical care as a new apostolate. This pattern was repeated as other communities of Sisters were established in the region. =Founder= In 1917 the Catholic Church established a new Code of Canon Law, which was the first organized juridical codification of the regulations for many aspects of the church's life and functioning. One of the effects was reinforcing the separation of cloistered communities. These new regulations would have severely hampered the work the nuns were undertaking. At the recommendation of the Master of the Order of Preachers, Ludwig Theissling, who was visiting Peru, the Sisters, under the auspices of Bishop Zubieta, decided to separate from the monastic community from which they had come and to form a new and independent congregation of Religious Sisters of the Dominican Third Order Regular. The new congregation was formally established on 5 October 1918 at the Convent of Our Lady of the Patronage in Lima. Nicol was elected as the first Prioress General of the congregation, and served in that office the rest of her life. She also served as the Mistress of novices, training the candidates to the congregation at their novitiate in Spain. During her generalship, she led her Sisters to establish themselves in other countries. In 1932 she led the founding community to mainland China, establishing what is to be the nucleus of their presence in Asia. She also established her congregation in Spain where they were able to recruit and form many missionary vocations. The General Motherhouse of the congregation was established in Pamplona, Navarre, Spain, and became her base. By 1938 Nicol increasingly frail and wanted to retire to prepare herself for her final days. Nevertheless, she accepted her unanimous re-election for a third term as Prioress General at the congregation's General Chapter of 1939. She died on 24 February 1940. Legacy Today the congregation has 785 Sisters serving in 21 nations on five continents. Its General Motherhouse is now in Madrid, Spain. Among its members, the congregation counts four Sisters who are considered to be martyrs for the faith, having been tortured and murdered in the former Republic of the Congo on 25 November 1964, in the course of the Simba Rebellion, after they refused to leave the patients in their hospital. Veneration The formal process for the canonization of Nicol was opened in Pamplona in September 1962. Pope John Paul II declared her Venerable in 2003. The following year a miracle was declared to have taken place through her intercession, due to which Pope Benedict XVI authorized the process to proceed. Thus, on 15 May 2005, in St. Peter's Square, Nicol was beatified in a ceremony presided over by Cardinal Jos√© Saraiva Martins. She was beatified along with another missionary religious sister, Marianne Cope, who worked among the lepers of Molokai, Hawaii.

Description  Preparation of \\"egg in the basket\\". The dish is typically bread with an egg in the center and then cooked with a little butter or oil. It is commonly prepared by cutting a circular or square hole in the center of a piece of bread. The bread, sometimes buttered prior to cooking, is fried in a pan with butter, margarine, cooking oil, or other fat. When browned, the bread is flipped, and the egg is cracked into the \\"basket\\" cut into the toast. Alternatively, the egg may be dropped into the bread before the bread is browned. The time the egg is placed in the bread is dependent on desired consistency. The dish is often either covered or flipped while cooking to obtain even cooking, and requires a degree of skill and temperature control to prevent burning either the egg or bread while the entire dish is cooked to the desired consistency. Appearance in pop culture The dish is prepared by actor Guy Kibbee in the 1935 Warner Bros film Mary Jane's Pa, leading to it sometimes being known as \\"Guy Kibbee eggs\\". It is also called \\"Betty Grable eggs\\", from the actress‚Äô preparation of \\"gashouse eggs\\" in the 1941 film Moon Over Miami. It is prepared by both Hugo Weaving and Stephen Fry's characters in the 2005 film V for Vendetta, the latter referring to it as \\"eggy in the basket\\". Other film appearances include Moonstruck (1987) and The Meddler (2016). On television, the dish is prepared in a 1996 episode of the sitcom Friends by the character Joey Tribbiani, who refers to it as \\"eggs with the bread with the hole in the middle, √† la me!\\" In the seventh episode of season two of Lucifer, it is prepared with Hawaiian bread and oyster leaves.

They were designed by Gordon Bashford. Their P4 designation is factory terminology for this group of cars and was not in day-to-day use by ordinary owners who would have used the appropriate consumer designations for their models such as Rover 90 or Rover 100. Production began in 1949 with the 6-cylinder 2.1-litre Rover 75. Four years later a 2-litre 4-cylinder Rover 60 was brought to the market to fit below the 75 and a 2.6-litre 6-cylinder Rover 90 to top the three-car range. Several variations followed. These cars are very much part of British culture and became known as the 'Auntie' Rovers.\\"Denis Jenkinson, being totally impressed with the Rover... remarked that the car had tackled the torturous journey just as if going to Auntie's for tea. The term of endearment stuck and forever after the P4 has carried its 'Auntie' nickname.\\" They were driven by royalty including Grace Kelly. The P4 series was supplemented in September 1958 by a new conservatively shaped Rover 3-litre P5 but the P4 series stayed in production until 1964 and their replacement by the Rover 2000. Engineering The earlier cars used a Rover engine from the 1948 Rover 75. A four-speed manual transmission was used with a column-mounted gear change at first and floor-mounted unit from September 1953. At first the gearbox only had synchromesh on third and top but it was added to second gear as well in 1953. A freewheel clutch, a traditional Rover feature, was fitted to cars without overdrive until mid-1959, when it was removed from the specifications, shortly before the London Motor Show in October that year. The cars had a separate chassis with independent suspension by coil springs at the front and a live axle with half-elliptical leaf springs at the rear. The brakes on early cars were operated by a hybrid hydro-mechanical system but became fully hydraulic in 1950. Girling disc brakes replaced drums at the front from October 1959. The complete body shells were made by the Pressed Steel company and featured aluminium/magnesium alloy (Birmabright) doors, boot lid and bonnets. If the handle was not used to close them they were easily dented so for the final 95/110 models steel was used instead. The P4 series was one of the last UK cars to incorporate rear-hinged \\"suicide\\" doors. Rover 75 Tickford drophead coup√© registered July 1951 Announced by Managing Director Spencer Wilks on 23 September 1949 the new Rover 75, now the only Rover in production, was first displayed at the opening day of the Earls Court Motor Show on 28 September 1949. It featured unusual modern styling in stark contrast with the outdated Rover 75 (P3) it replaced. Gone were the traditional radiator, separate headlamps and external running boards. In their place were a chromium grille, recessed headlamps and a streamlined body the whole width of the chassis. A steering column-mounted gear lever was fitted.New Rover Car. TRADITIONAL FEATURES ABANDONED. The Times, Friday, Sep 23, 1949; pg. 2; Issue 51494 The car's styling was derived from the then controversial 1947 Studebakers. The Rover executives purchased two such vehicles and fitted the body from one of them to a prototype P4 chassis to create a development mule. James Taylor's book 'Rover P4 ‚Äì The Complete Story' says that this vehicle was affectionately known as the 'Roverbaker' hybrid. Malcolm Bobbit states \\"The P4 set the seal on the future with a vengeance. Rover defied its critics with the P4's new look and to get some idea of the shock of the new, consider some of its rivals . . . astonishment at the P4's courageous styling.\\" The P3 had almost no boot at all yet that had been considered rather more than adequate. The new car's bonnet-like extension to its rear was ridiculed; the driver sat well forward looking out over a relatively short bonnet and the rear wheels were set well back behind the back seat. All the new car's proportions were different from all the other new cars. Another, at the time minor, distinctive feature but this one did not catch on was the centrally mounted light in the grille where most other manufacturers of good quality cars provided a pair, one fog and one driving light often separately mounted behind the bumper. Known as the \\"Cyclops eye\\" it was discontinued in the new grille announced 23 October 1952. Power came from a more powerful version of the previous model's 2.1 L (2103 cc/128 in¬≥) Rover IOE straight-6 engine now with chromium-plated cylinder bores, an aluminium cylinder head with built-in induction manifold and a pair of horizontal instead of downdraught carburetters.

Rover's stated intention was \\"to cater for a wider field of motorists who require a quality car with varying degrees of economical running costs and performance\\". On the same day there were modifications announced which were accordingly shared by all three: * a curved central gear change lever. This was Rover's response to the dislike of many motorists for the steering column gear change with its complex linkages. The shape of the new lever still allowed three people to make use of the front bench seat. * parking lights were mounted on top of the front mudguards, the disused apertures below were used for reflectors ‚Äì and later for traffic indicators.

Its 2.0 L (1997 cc/121 in¬≥) engine had been used in the early Land Rover though it now had modifications including an SU carburettor. As the block was shorter than that of the 6-cylinder engine, it sat further back in the frame, and this is sometimes held to have resulted in better handling and compensated for the lack of power.

Independently adjustable separate front seats were made available at extra cost from September 1955. In the same way Rover 60 buyers were given the choice of a different style of front seat, two individual seats independently adjustable, available at extra cost from September 1955.

The Rover 60 was replaced by the Rover 80 which used an updated version of the overhead-valve 2286 cc (138 in¬≥) four used in the Land Rover of that time. The Rover 80 was announced 24 October 1959. Rover 90 The top-end Rover 90 appeared with a much larger more powerful inline-six at the same time, 24 September 1953 as the four-cylinder Rover 60 was introduced. Rover's idiosyncratic central gear change lever designed to allow three-abreast seating in front was used for this new car. This engine produced 90 hp (67 kW) and could propel the car to reach 90 mph (145 km/h). It has a cast-iron block with an aluminium alloy head, a bore and stroke of by and a 6.73:1 compression ratio. This was upped to 7.5:1 in 1956. Rover's stated intention was to cater for a wider field of motorists requiring varying degrees of performance and running costs. The Rover 90 shared with the Rover 60 and Rover 75 the October 1954 modifications: a bigger boot, wide rear window and flashing directions indicators all announced at the Paris Motor Show. The 1956 model was launched in September 1955. Independently adjustable separate front seats were made available at extra cost and at the same time the engine's compression ratio was increased from 6.73:1 to 7.5:1, lifting power by 3 horsepower to 93. Free-wheel was dropped and Laycock de Normanville electric overdrive made available. More sensitive power brakes were provided of a redesigned pattern. The recesses in the 'B' pillars that previously housed the trafficators in pre-1955 models were deleted in this update. Pleats were added to the seats, this treatment continued on subsequent P4 models. In September 1956 the shape of the front mudguards was rearranged with the side lamps and flashing indicators in different positions. A small chrome reflector on the headlamp rim allowed the driver to know the side lights were functioning. Testing the Ninety in 1954 The Motor magazine recorded a top speed of and acceleration from 0‚Äì of 18.9 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost ¬£1297 including taxes. A road test of a Ninety published in MotorSport magazine in September 1956 described the engine as virtually inaudible when idling but the steering was \\"spongy and heavy\\" and \\"the roll when cornering was considerable\\" nevertheless, reported MotorSport, firm suspension caused \\"very appreciable column shake and body judder\\".One of Britain's Finest Cars ‚Äî The Rover 90.

The higher compression was to take advantage of the higher octane fuel that had become widely available. This twin-SU carburettor engine produced 108 hp (80 kW). Both 105 models also featured the exterior changes of the rest of the range announced a month earlier. The 105S featured separate front seats, a cigar lighter, chromed wheel trim rings and twin Lucas SFT 576 spotlamps. To minimise the cost of the 105R, these additional items were not standard, however they were provided on the (higher priced) 105R De Luxe. The 105R featured a \\"Roverdrive\\" automatic transmission. This unit was designed and built by Rover and at the time was the only British-built automatic transmission. Others had bought in units from American manufacturers such as Borg-Warner. This unit was actually a two-speed automatic (Emergency Low which can be selected manually and Drive) with an overdrive unit for a total of three forward gears. The 105S made do with a manual transmission and Laycock de Normanville overdrive incorporating a kick-down control. The 105S could reach a top speed of 101 mph (163 km). The Motor magazine tested a 105R de luxe in 1957 and found it to have a top speed of and acceleration from 0‚Äì of 23.1 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost ¬£1696 including taxes of ¬£566. Production of the 105 line ended in 1958 for the 105R and 1959 for the manual transmission 105S, 10,781 had been produced, two- thirds with the manual transmission option. For 1959 the manual model was described simply as a 105 and the trim and accessory level was reduced to match the other models. When the Rover 100 was announced in October 1959 it was described as the replacement for the Rover 90 and the Rover 105.Rover. Cars for 1960. The Times, Wednesday, Oct 21, 1959; pg. 7; Issue 54597 Rover 80 The 3-litre P5 car introduced in September 1958 was in full production and the obsolescent P4 range was reduced to just two cars, this new four- cylinder 80, announced on 24 October 1959 and the Rover 100 announced at the same time. The 80 engine was a new Land Rover-derived straight-four overhead- valve engine displacing ', entirely different from the units used in all the other models. With 80 hp (59 kW) available, the car could top 85 mph (137 km/h). Girling vacuum servo-assisted disc brakes at the front were new, and the car used wider tyres and had updated styling. Overdrive, operating on top gear only, was standard on the four-speed transmission. Options included a radio, two tone paint schemes, and either a bench or individual front seats. These options also apply to the 100 (see below). The four-cylinder cars were never popular, and just 5,900 had been built when, after 3 years, production ended. Its place was taken by the new Rover 95 announced September 1962. The Motor magazine tested an 80 in 1961 and recorded a top speed of and acceleration from 0‚Äì of 22.4 seconds.

Its new but similar IOE straight-6 engine was a short-stroke version of the P5 3-Litre unit. The 100 could reach 100 mph (161 km/h). The interior was luxurious, with wood and leather accents on traditional English car elements like a curved \\"Shepherds Crook\\" handbrake lever. A bench front seat or individual front seats could be ordered. A heater was a standard fitting. Like the smaller 80 version, the 100 was fitted with servo-assisted Girling disc brakes at the front, keeping drum brakes at the rear. Overdrive, on top gear only, was a standard fitting. Production ended in 1962, by which time 16,521 had been produced.

The wider availability of higher octane fuels permitted an increase in the compression ratio to 8.8:1, and the old unit now produced 123 hp (91 kW) in 110 guise, which used a Weslake cylinder head, and 102 hp (76 kW) in the 95. The Motor magazine road tested, ref 2/64, a Rover 110 on 30 January 1963. This car achieved a mean maximum of 100.0 mph, 0-60 mph in 15.9 seconds and the standing quarter mile in 20.6 seconds.

Gas turbine cars Rover JET 1 gas turbine car, on display at the Science Museum London The P4 platform was used in Rover's gas turbine programme, most notably as the origin of the JET 1 prototype shown to the public in the United Kingdom and United States in 1950 and subjected to speed tests on the Jabbeke highway in Belgium in 1952. JET 1, a mid-engine two-seat open tourer, was based on the P4 bodyshell. The original JET 1 is on display in the London Science Museum. Two further prototypes powered by gas turbine were based on the P4. The T2 had a four-door body and its gas turbine under the bonnet at the front of the car. Problems with the T2 caused Rover to abandon the front-engine concept and rebuild the car, redesignated T2A, with the turbine over the rear wheels.

The road is part of the A12, a 129-mile road connecting Blackwall in London with the seaside town of Great Yarmouth in Norfolk. Route The road starts off at the end of the A12 Hackney Wick to M11 Link Road, a section of the A12 built in 1999 to bypass Wanstead and to link it with the former A102 (M) (now A12). It meets the Redbridge Roundabout, where the A12 meets the North Circular (A406). Prior to 1989, the road was the M15, providing a direct link onto the M11 motorway. It then heads down to the Gants Hill Roundabout near Ilford. It passes through a very built up area, and heads through Newbury Park, passing Newbury Park tube station. It then passes William Torbit School. A few miles down the road it goes into the suburban town of Romford. After this, it ends at the Gallows Corner roundabout (a former execution site) where it meets with the A127. Traffic wishing to go down to Southend on the A127 must use the flyover, built as a temporary measure in 1969; it was originally designed for the M12 motorway, which would have run from South Woodford at the M11 to the proposed Maplin Sands Airport in Southend-on-Sea.  History  The road was built in the 1920s through 1930s as a bypass of the A12 (now A118), which went through Romford, Chadwell Heath, Goodmayes, Ilford before meeting the A11 at Stratford. It was originally designated the A106. By the mid-1940s, the road had been re- designated as the A12, with the old A12 being downgraded to the non-primary A118 road, which now ends at the A11 in Bow.  M11 and A13  The Eastern Avenue is mostly used by local traffic, because the M11 motorway, built in 1980, is effectively a complete bypass of the Eastern Avenue, and the A13 also provides a much quicker route into London. It is a slow road. as the speed limits are only 50 mph and 40 mph, and there are traffic lights at almost every junction, with roundabouts and frontal development. However, when there is traffic on the M25, heavy goods vehicles and other through traffic heading into London will often use the Eastern Avenue instead.

They are in the Great Basin classification of Indigenous People. Their traditional lands include northern Nevada, southeastern Oregon, southern Idaho, and western Wyoming. Today they are enrolled in the federally recognized Shoshone-Bannock Tribes of the Fort Hall Reservation of Idaho, located on the Fort Hall Indian Reservation. History Illustration by Frederic Remington of a Bannock hunting party fording the Snake River during the Bannock War of 1895 Traditionally, the Northern Paiute traded with surrounding tribes. The bands in eastern Oregon traded with the tribes to the north, who by 1730 had acquired the horse.Haines In the mid-18th century, some bands developed a horse culture and split off to become the Bannock tribe. The horse gave the tribe a greater range, from Oregon to northern Nevada, southern Idaho, and western Wyoming. They forayed from there on the Bannock Trail to Montana and Canada to hunt buffalo. The Bannock made pottery, utensils from mountain sheep horns, and carrying bags from salmon skin. Their petroglyphs date back before European contact, and, after the introduction of glass beads, they transferred their geometric design to beadwork. For water transport, they made tule reed rafts. Prior to the late 19th century, Bannock people fished for salmon on the Snake River in Idaho and in the fall, they hunted buffalo herds. Buffalo hides provided material for tipis. The Bannock are prominent in American history due to the Bannock War of 1878. After the war, the Bannock moved onto the Fort Hall Indian Reservation with the Northern Shoshone and gradually their tribes merged. Today they are called the Shoshone-Bannock. The Bannock live on the Fort Hall Indian Reservation, 544,000 acres (2,201 km¬≤) in Southeastern Idaho. Lemhi and Northern Shoshone live with the Bannock Indians.

In October 1969, he went to Denmark to attend Sex 69, the first porn trade show hosted in Copenhagen after the legalization of adult pornography there. This resulted in his first movie, Censorship in Denmark: A New Approach (1970), which was released the following year. He was the editor on Sexual Encounter Group (1970), was a cinematographer on seven movies, and wrote five screenplays. His production Lady Freaks (1973) introduced porn star legend Annette Haven. His films also include the two 1970s porn classics Babyface (1977) and Pretty Peaches (1978). Another de Renzy discovery was Desire√© Cousteau.

It had 7 million speakers in 2020. Most Tiv speakers are found in Benue State in Nigeria. The language is also widely spoken in the Nigerian states of Plateau, Taraba, Nasarawa and Cross River as well as the FCT Abuja. It is by far the largest of the Tivoid languages, a group of languages belonging to the Southern Bantoid branch of Benue‚ÄìCongo.  Dialects  Tiv has no dialects. Tiv speakers can understand each other across their territory. However, accents (ham) exist. The accents of Tiv are as follows: * Ityoisha, spoken in the southeast, noted for its exaggerated palatalisation of vowels; * Shitile, spoken by most Tiv east of the Katsina Ala River, apparently slower sounding than the other Tiv accents and slurs vowels into their neighbouring consonant; * Iharev, which gives an exaggerated roll to the phoneme ~ * Kparev, spoken in the centre and south- centre; ** Kunav, a sub-accent of Kparev, noted for its preference for sounds where other Kparev use . Vocabulary, particularly plant and tool names, changes from one part of Tiv territory to the other.  History and classification  The first reference to the Tiv language (dzwa Tiv) was made by Koelle (1854) from liberated slaves from Sierra Leone. Johnston (1919) classified it as a peculiar language among the Semi-Bantu languages, and Talbot (1926) concurred. Abraham (1933), who has made the most complete linguistic study of Tiv, classifies it as Bantu, stating that its vocabulary is more similar to the East African Nyanza group of Bantu languages than to Ekoi or other neighbouring languages. Malherbe (1933) agrees with Abraham that Tiv is essentially Bantu. All material on Tiv seems to point to a recent expansion, perhaps as late as the 18th century.  Phonology  = Tone = Tiv has three main tones (five if rising and falling are counted as separate tones instead of composites of existing tones). They are most importantly used in inflection.  Morphology  Tiv has nine noun classes.

They constitute approximately 3.5% of Nigeria's total population, and number about 6.5 million individuals throughout Nigeria and Cameroon. The Tiv language is spoken by about 7 million people in Nigeria with a few speakers in Cameroon. Most of the language's Nigerian speakers are found in Benue, Taraba, Nasarawa and Plateau States. The language is a branch of Benue‚ÄìCongo and ultimately of the Niger‚ÄìCongo phylum. In pre-colonial times, the Fulani ethnic group referred to the Tiv as \\"Munchi\\" (also sometimes written Munshi e.g. Duggan 1932), a term not accepted by Tiv people. They depend on agricultural produce for commerce and life. History The Tiv say they emerged into their present location from the southeast. It is claimed that the Tiv wandered through southern, south-central and west-central Africa before arriving at the savannah lands of West African Sudan via the River Congo and Cameroon Mountains and settled at Swemkaragbe the region adjoining Cameron and Nigeria in the beginning of 1500 CE.\\"Coming down,\\" as they put it, was in batches, some moved southward across Obudu mountains others moved northward and settled at Mdema and Waka district, while others moved into Central Nigeria. These dispersions took place in the late 1500 CE to 1600 CE, over time as social interactions began they also mingled with the Fulani with whom they still recognize a joking relationship (\\"Fulani Jo and Tiv Jo\\"). The Tiv people were a free people without a king; hence every clan or kindred was administered by the eldest man called \\"Orya\\" they were amongst the first inhabitants of the Benue Valley according to mark Cartwright record of Bantu migration before other tribes finally migrated to join them, Due to their peaceful disposition and dispersed nature of living, no Central government nor king, they posed no threat to new migrants to the region who cohabited with them until the coming of the Europeans. The Europeans first contact with Tiv was in the 18th century. Note that the time of encounter with the European does not means their time of migration, their late recognition was due to the lack of kingship which became a big disadvantage to Tiv in Nigeria because the colonial masters prefer working with kings, so when the Tiv were found on the banks of the Benue River and were known to be the major occupants of the Benue Valley, That was when kinship was later introduced to Tiv people by the European in the 1940s Benue.http://www.everyculture.com/knowledge/Benue_River.html In 1879 their occupation of the riverbanks was about the same as in 1950. British occupying forces entered Tivland from the east in 1906, when they were called in to protect a Hausa and Jukun enclave that the Tiv had attacked. The Tiv said in 1950 that they had defeated this British force, then later invited the British in. The southern area was penetrated from the south; what southern Tiv call \\"the eruption\\" of the British there occurred in 1911. The Tiv came into contact with European culture during the colonial period. During November 1907 to spring 1908, an expedition of the Southern Nigeria Regiment led by Lieutenant-Colonel Hugh Trenchard came into contact with the Tiv. Trenchard brought gifts for the tribal chiefs. Subsequently, roads were built and trade links established between Europeans and the Tiv. But before construction of roads began, a missionary named Mary Slessor went throughout the region seeing to the people's needs. National attire ('anger') The Tiv national attire is the black-and-white-striped anger. When the Tiv people arrived at their current location several centuries earlier, they discovered that the zebra they used to hunt for meat and skin, used for ceremonial attire, was not native to the area. When they acquired the skill of the loom, they decided to honour their heritage by weaving a cloth with black-and-white stripes, reminiscent of the zebra skin; this would then be made the preferred attire. Initially, it was a simple cloth to be draped around the torso. Nowadays, it is made into elaborate robes, such as those worn by the traditional rulers and elders ‚Äì from the Tor Tiv downwards. The black-and-white colour of the necklaces worn by the traditional rulers has been chosen to match the robes. **Other Tiv cutural clothes are** Ivvavtyo, Lishi, Gbev-whaa, Godo, Tugudu, Chado, Deremen, Gbagir.  Social and political organization  Most Tiv have a highly developed sense of genealogy, with descent being reckoned patrilineally. Ancestry is traced to an ancient individual named Tiv, who had two sons; all Tiv consider themselves a member either of Ichongo (descendants of son Chongo) or of Ipusu (descendants of son Pusu). Ichongo and Ipusu are each divided into several major branches, which in turn are divided into smaller branches. The smallest branch, or minimal lineage, is the ipaven. Members of an ipaven tend to live together, the local kin-based community being called the \\"tar\\". This form of social organisation, called a segmentary lineage, is seen in various parts of the world, but it is particularly well known from African societies (Middleton and Tait 1958). The Tiv are the best-known example in West Africa of a society of segmentary lineage, as documented by Laura Bohannan (1952) and by Paul and Laura Bohannan (1953); in East Africa, the best-known example is the Nuer, documented by E.E. Evans-Pritchard (1940). The Tiv had no administrative divisions and no chiefs nor councils. Leadership was based on age, influence and affluence. The leaders' functions were to furnish safe conduct, arbitrate disputes within their lineages, sit on moots and lead their people in all external and internal affairs. These socio-political arrangements caused great frustration to British colonial attempts to subjugate the population and establish administration on the lower Benue. The strategy of indirect rule, which the British felt to be highly successful in controlling Hausa and Fulani populations in Northern Nigeria, was ineffective in a segmentary society like the Tiv (Dorward 1969). Colonial officers tried various approaches to administration, such as putting the Tiv under the control of the nearby Jukun, and trying to exert control through the councils of elders (\\"Jir Tamen\\"); these met with little success. The British administration in 1934 divided the Tiv into Clans, Kindreds, and Family Groups. The British appointed native heads of these divisions as well. These administrative divisions are gradually assuming a reality which they never had originally. Members of the Tiv group are found in many areas across the globe, such as the United States and United Kingdom. In these countries, they hold unions, known as MUT (Mzough U Tiv, or Mutual Union of Tiv in English), where members can assemble and discuss issues concerning their people across the world, but especially back in Nigeria. The arm of the MUT serving the United States of America is known as MUTA (Mzough U Tiv ken Amerika, or Mutual Union of the Tiv in America), for instance. Before the introduction of printed material, radio, film and television, mass communication in Nigeria was done through the indigenous people with the use of traditional political systems of communication. The rulers and the chiefs governed their ethnic communities and communicated with them through various channels.  Society and culture  = Tiv music and communication = Locally made musical instruments were traditionally used for political and ceremonial communication. The key instruments follow. **Kakaki** The Kakaki is a royal trumpet used in many West African groups in Nigeria, Niger, Chad and Burkina Faso. This is an instrument used to convey special messages to the people of the community, such as the birth of the child of the King, his naming ceremony, the crowning of a new king, or to gather people together during the marriage ceremony of the king and the king's son's marriage ceremony.https://www.dailytrust.com.ng/sunday/index.php/newsroyale/13530-the- mystique-of-the-kakaki This instrument was used to convey all the messages to the people to assemble at the square for the ceremony. When there is an enemy attack on the community, a warning sound of the Kakaki is blown to alert those who can defend the society and every citizen to be alert. **Ilyu** A light wooden instrument, it was used to pass messages to the people of the village, probably for the invitation of the people for a particular meeting of the elders at the king's palace or for the people to gather at the market square for a message from or by the king. Up till today, it is the main instrument for the celebration of newlyweds (marriage reception ceremony or Kwase-kuhan). **Indyer** A heavy wooden instrument carved out of mahogany trunk through some mysterious way; myth has it that a chosen carver turns into a worm to create the large hollow in the cut trunk, leaving only a small opening (like in a medical operation). This belief is perhaps due to the fact that the carvers are reluctant to explain the technique employed for such artistic finesse. The Indyer, believed to be connected with high magico-spiritual potency, is not played for secular purposes except for special occasions as sanctioned by the elders. It is used to communicate the death of an important personality in the community or to communicate a serious happening in the community, like a call to war. **Akya** It is used together with Agbande (drums) combined with Ageda at festivals to pass a message across to the people for a call for the display of culture. **Adiguve** It is an instrument like a violin, used for music and dances in conjunction with Agbande (Agbande) at festivals and dance occasions, sometimes to announce the death of a leader or an elder of the community. During this period it is played sorrowfully for the mourning of the dead. It is mostly played at funerals. **Gbande** Agbande (plural) are a set of crafted wooden musical instruments used to complement agbande at festivals. They are particularly large and are played by the young men of the community. Special drum beats communicate special messages and music for the festivals to come and during the festivals, for instance, royal occasions such as the coronation and funeral. **Ortindin (Ortyom) ‚Äì Messenger** Usually, he is chosen by the elders of the community to do errands for the elders and the leader of the community. He is sent out to the heads of the neighbouring families for a crucial meeting at the head of all the leaders of the community. **Kolugh ku Bua ‚Äì Cow Horn** This is an instrument made out of cow horns. There are farmers' associations that use this instrument when they have a job to do; for instance, when they are invited to make ridges on a piece of land, the Public Relations Officer (PRO) of the association will use this medium to wake up the members for the work they have for that day. Indigenous communication is not only vertical, from the rulers to the subjects, but is also horizontal. Individuals communicate with society through physical and metaphysical means. A farm owner, for example, may mount a charm conspicuously on his farm in order to stress private ownership and to scare off human intruders. The fear of herbalists and witches influences social behaviour considerably. Rainmakers communicate their power to disrupt events through various psychological means. Village sectors in Africa communicate mostly via the marketplace of ideas contributed by traditional religion, observances, divination, mythology, age- grades, the Chiefs courts, the elder's square, secret and title societies, the village market square, the village drum (gbande) men, indeed the total experiences of the villager in his environment. Unlike the mass media, access to the native media is culturally determined and not economic. Only the selected group of young men or the elders can disseminate information generally. The young only disseminate general information about events and the social welfare of their communities using the media mentioned above. The Tiv people of Benue state still practise some of this traditional system of communication, using the Kakais, Agbande, Indyer, Adiguve, Ilyu, etc. Nevertheless, the increase in the western world media is threatening the cultural communication system. Many of the communities in Benue state still use these instruments to convey messages to the people of their community, and it is helping a great deal, since there is a language barrier between people with the introduction of the western world's means of communication, using a western language (English) to convey information. =Cuisine= The common Tiv food are mostly solid, cooked, pounded or prepared with hot water. They are mostly carbohydrates or byproducts of yams, cocoa-yam, cassava, beans, corn, etc. The Tiv are known to be the food basket of Nigeria. Tiv have been identified by the British with sesame seed as the British named it Beni-seed because it was the major cash crop exported to Europe and other colonies from the Benue valley. Some common Tiv foods are ruam kumen (pounded yam), ruam nahan (turned food), akuto (sweet potato pottage), choko (dafa), akpukpa, etc **soups** pocho, ager, genger, atyever, tur, vambe, igyo, agbende a ashwe, mngishim, ashwe, okra, vegetables, ijor, aninge, furum, adenger, gbungu, angahar a ikyuna, gbande. **Tiv staples** roasted yams, ahuma, rice and beans (chingalev) **beverages** burukutu, ibyer **Snacks** peanuts and sesame (beni-seed), asondo (dried sweet potatoes), igbough ahi (roasted or boiled bambara nuts), mzembe (roasted pears), huu (roasted termites), alie and nyata, kweese (beans cake) File:Tiv food.jpgthumbpounded yam and assorted soup File:Burukutu.pngthumbBurukutu File:Gnuts and sesame.pngthumbpeanuts and sesame File:Ibyer.jpgthumbIbyer File:Chicken and sesame.jpgthumbkyegh sha ishwa File:Mzembe.pngthumbMzembe or pears File:Roasted yam.pngthumbRoasted yam Demographics =Benue state = Tarkaa, Makurdi, Gwer East, Gwer west, Ukum, Logo, Konshisha, Gboko, Kwande, Vandeikya, Katsina Ala, Guma, Buruku, and Ushongo Local Government Areas. =Nassarawa state= Doma, Nasarawa, Lafia, Obi, Keana, and Awe Local Government Areas =Plateau state= Qua‚Äôan Pan and Shendam Local Government Areas =Taraba state= Bali, Donga, Ibi, Gassol, Takum, and Wukari Local Government Areas =Cross River state= Yala, Bekwara, Obudu, and Obanliku Local Government Areas. https://www.joshuaproject.net/people_groups/15505/NI =Cameroon = 1700 households at the south-western border of Cameroon https://www.joshuaproject.net/people_groups/15505 Notable people =Politicians and activists= J.

It is one of the Clee Hills, in the Shropshire Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The nearest town to the hill is Ludlow, which can be seen from parts of Cleehill village. Geography Titterstone Clee is the third-highest hill in Shropshire, surpassed only by the nearby Brown Clee Hill () and Stiperstones (). Much of the higher part of the hill is common land, used for the grazing of sheep, air traffic control services and both working and disused quarries. The summit of Titterstone Clee is bleak, treeless and shaped by decades of quarrying. Many of the industrial structures still remain. Most of the summit of the hill is affected by man-made activity, the result of hill fort construction during the Bronze and Iron Ages and, more recently, by years of mining for coal and quarrying for dolerite, known locally as 'dhustone', for use in road-building. Many derelict quarry buildings scattered over the hill are of industrial archaeological interest as very early examples of the use of reinforced concrete. The village of Cleehill lies on this road as it crosses the hill. At above sea level, it was home to what was, until it closed, the highest pub in Shropshire, called The Kremlin,BBC Shropshire The Kremlin, Cleehill and also to the highest primary school. On the northeast slope of the hill is the small village of Cleeton St Mary. Geology The hill rises above the surrounding countryside by virtue of its distinctive geology, the igneous rocks capping both Titterstone Clee and Clee Hill being more resistant to erosion than the neighbouring sedimentary rocks. Most of the lower ground is underlain by mudstones and sandstones of Devonian age and collected together as the Old Red Sandstone. The uppermost part of this succession is the St Maughans Formation and on the northern and western sides it rises almost to the summit where it is then capped by a hard-wearing dolerite sill. A similar but larger and separate intrusion caps Clee Hill to the south. The Old Red Sandstone is unconformably overlain by Carboniferous Limestone which locally is accounted for by the Orton Limestone Formation and the Lower Limestone Shale Group. These rocks occur in a curved outcrop to the south of Cleehill village and to the north around Farlow. Overlying this is the Cornbrook Sandstone formation, the local representative of the Millstone Grit underlying the ground between Cleehill village and Knowle and also to the northeast of the hill. This is succeeded by the mudstones, siltstones and sandstones of the Lower and Middle Coal Measures which makes up much of the rest of the surface of the hill extending southwest to Knowbury and northeast beneath Catherton Common. It contains seatearths and coal seams which have been worked in the past. The lowermost and most extensive of these, just above the basal sandstone of the Coal Measures is known as the 'Gutter Coal'. The dark coloured dolerite of the sill is known locally as Dhu Stone ('dhu' may have arisen from the Welsh 'du' meaning 'black'). It is an olivine basalt which appears to have been intruded as a sill between sandstone layers within the unconsolidated strata of the Middle Westphalian sediments soon after deposition of the latter.Shropshire Geology ‚Äì Titterstone Clee A fault system runs ENE-WSW across the southern flanks of these hills. The northerly downthrowing Leinthall Earls Fault runs off to the WSW whilst the Titterstone Clee Fault runs off the ENE. Other smaller faults, some at right angles to these named faults, affect both the sedimentary strata dn the intruded sills. Near the summit is the Giant's Chair ‚Äì a pile of boulders created during cold phases of the Devensian ice age. History, quarrying and land usage Near the summit trig point are the remains of a Bronze Age cairn, dating back up to 4,000 years and indicating that the summit was a likely ceremonial site. Although partly destroyed by quarrying, Titterstone Clee's Iron Age hill fort or encampment, enclosed by a huge boundary earthworks, has fared better than those on Brown Clee. It is of note that the walls of the fort are made up of stone blocks, instead of earth banks. Clee Hill is one of only a few hills and mountains noted on the Hereford Mappa Mundi, a 13th-century map of the world displayed at Hereford Cathedral. In medieval times ironstone and, later, coal were mined, in particular from bell pits: localised mine shafts, one of which has now flooded to form a lake. Over the years large numbers of quarries were opened up on Titterstone Clee to exploit the dolerite. All but one, on Clee Hill, are now abandoned. The largest quarries have sheer drops of up to around 100 feet (30m). Before the Second World War, the area would be described as industrial, because of the presence of wide-scale quarrying and associated activity. Men came from places such as Bridgnorth and Ludlow to work in the quarries, and the villages of Bedlam and Dhustone on Titterstone Clee were built especially for the quarry workers. Crumbling remains of quarry buildings now litter the hill, reminders of a bygone industry that once employed more than 2,000 people here. An old narrow gauge railway incline is still visible on the hill and a large concrete structure under which the wagons were filled with stone still remains next to the modern day car park. Nearby, on the flanks of Clee Hill, a standard gauge railway incline provided means of exporting quarried stone from above Cleehill village. This railway infrastructure remained intact until abandoned in the early 1960s.D.J. Norton Railway Photographs In the past the quarries have also been worked (on a much smaller scale) for coal, fireclay and limestone. Early in the 20th century, a further large quarry (the Magpie Quarry) opened on the eastern side of Clee Hill and an aerial ropeway was built to carry stone off the hill eastwards to the railway at Detton Ford. The footings for the tall pylons which supported the wires still remain near the summit, parallel to the modern day track to the radar domes. Clee Hill is still quarried behind Cleehill village. Quarrying resumed here in the late 1980s, 50 years after the Titterstone Clee Dhustone quarry closed just below the summit. The main buildings of the quarry are just visible from the A4117 road but virtually hidden from view by ingenious landscaping. Several radar domes and towers operate on the summit of the hill. The largest of the radar arrays is part of the National Air Traffic Services (NATS) radar network, and covers one of 30 overlapping regions of UK airspace. The one on Titterstone Clee monitors all aircraft within a 100-mile radius. The smaller of the two is a Met Office weather radar station which is part of a network of 16 across the country used to detect cloud precipitation (rain). The domes and masts are well-known local landmarks, with one in particular often being nicknamed 'the golf ball'. A 20th century triangulation pillar marks the summit Access and recreation The summit area and unenclosed upper slopes of Titterstone Clee, along with Clee Hill to its south, were mapped as 'open country' under the provisions of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 and thereby freely available to walkers. There is in addition a dense network of footpaths and bridleways running both across the unenclosed land and also the enclosed farmland surrounding the hill. Some connect from the A4117 Cleobury Mortimer to Ludlow road which runs east-west across Clee Hill Common's southern flanks (reaching a height of above sea level at its highest point) though a minor public road reaches to the upper parts of the hill where there are parking areas. Thus Titterstone Clee is popular with walkers and picnickers, but much less so than nearby hills such as the Long Mynd. From the summit the Shropshire Way runs north to Brown Clee Hill, southwest to Ludlow and east to Cleobury Mortimer. Another long-distance trail, the Jack Mytton Way runs along the northeastern margin of the hill. From the hill it is possible on a clear day to see west to Snowdonia, north east to the Peak District, east to the Black Country, south east to the Cotswolds, south to the Malvern Hills, and south west to the Black Mountains and Brecon Beacons. The hill is said to provide one of the best views in England on a clear day. In fiction Titterstone Clee plays a central role in the Ellis Peters' novel The Virgin in the Ice.

It is available as an inhaler, cream, pills, and nasal spray. The inhaled form is used in the long- term management of asthma. The cream may be used for dermatitis and psoriasis. The pills have been used to treat ulcerative colitis. The nasal spray is used to treat allergic rhinitis and nasal polyps. Common side effects with the inhaled form include respiratory infections, headaches, and throat inflammation. Serious side effects include an increased risk of infection, cataracts, Cushing's syndrome, and severe allergic reactions. Long-term use of the pill form may cause adrenal insufficiency. The pills may also cause mood or personality changes. The inhaled form is generally regarded as safe in pregnancy. Beclometasone is mainly a glucocorticoid. Beclometasone dipropionate was first patented in 1962 and used medically in 1972. It was approved for medical use in the United States in 1976. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2017, it was the 153rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than four million prescriptions. Side effects Common side effects with the inhaled form include respiratory infections, headaches, and throat inflammation. Serious side effects include an increased risk of infection, cataracts, Cushing's syndrome, and severe allergic reactions. Long-term use of the pill form may cause adrenal insufficiency. The pills may also cause mood or personality changes. The inhaled form is generally regarded as safe in pregnancy. Occasionally, it may cause a cough upon inhalation. Deposition on the tongue and throat may promote oral candidiasis, which appears as a white coating, possibly with irritation. This may usually be prevented by rinsing the mouth with water after using the inhaler. Other adverse drug reaction side effects may rarely include: a smell similar to burning plastic, unpleasant taste, hoarseness or nasal congestion, pain or headache, and visual changes. Allergic reactions may occur, but rarely. Nasal corticosteroids may be associated with central serous retinopathy. Pharmacology Beclometasone is mainly a glucocorticoid. Glucocorticoids are corticosteroids that bind to the glucocorticoid receptor that is present in almost every vertebrate animal cell. The activated glucocorticoid receptor-glucocorticoid complex up- regulates the expression of anti-inflammatory proteins in the nucleus (a process known as transactivation) and represses the expression of proinflammatory proteins in the cytosol by preventing the translocation of other transcription factors from the cytosol into the nucleus (transrepression). Glucocorticoids are part of the feedback mechanism in the immune system which reduces certain aspects of immune function, such as inflammation. Names Beclometasone dipropionate is the INN modified and beclomethasone dipropionate is the USAN and former BAN. It is a prodrug of the free form, beclometasone (INN). The prodrug beclometasone is marketed in Norway and Russia. Clenil, Qvar are brandnames for the inhalers. Beconase, Alanase, Vancenase, Qnasl for the nasal spray or aerosol.

The district is in Mashonaland East province of Zimbabwe. It is almost entirely inhabited by Shona-speaking people (specific dialect: Zezuru). The traditional rulers of the area are the Nhowe people, whose chieftainship is called Mangwende. Many of the Nhowe people use Mukarakate as a surname, because it is the name of a great-great-ancestor of the tribe. Their totem is 'Moyo Muzukuru', which uses the bull as its symbolic animal. However, in practice, the tribe strictly holds only the heart of the animal as sacred, not the whole animal. Currently, the Mangwende Chieftainship is vacant following the death of Jonathan Tafirenyika Chibanda who passed on in South Africa on the 16th of December 2013. Chief Jonathan Mangwende was once president of the chief's council. Jonathan Tafirenyika Chibanda was the son of Chief Chataika Chibanda Mangwende. Chibanda became chief Mangwende in 1926 and died in 1936. Chibanda only ruled for 10 years. Jonathan Tafirenyika Chibanda become chief Mangwende in 1968. Prior to that he was a teacher at Chinhenga primary school. It is widely believed that the next Chief Mangwende will come from the Bokoto lineage.

The result is similar to the H√¥tel de Ville in Paris in what is considered to be \\"French Neo-Renaissance\\" style. However, at the Rijksmuseum the Gothic elements seem to outweigh the Renaissance and the building, despite the English Renaissance quoins, and chateauesque roofs, is sometimes considered to be Neo-Gothic. Petrus Josephus Hubertus \\"Pierre\\" Cuypers (16 May 1827 - 3 March 1921) was a Dutch architect. His name is most frequently associated with the Amsterdam Central Station (1881‚Äì1889) and the Rijksmuseum (1876‚Äì1885), both in Amsterdam. More representative for his oeuvre, however, are numerous churches, of which he designed more than 100. Moreover, he restored many monuments.  Biography  Cuypers was born in Roermond, the son of a church painter, and grew up in surroundings in which interest for art was encouraged. After he studied at the urban college in Roermond, he moved to Antwerp in 1844 to study architecture at the Royal art academy. He was taught by Frans Andries Durlet, Frans Stoop and Ferdinand Berckmans, all pioneers of the neo-Gothic architecture in Belgium. Cuypers was a good student; in 1849, he gained the Prix d'Excellence of the academy. After a tour in the German Rheinland, he returned to Roermond, where he was appointed a town architect in 1851. In 1852, he opened a workshop where ecclesiastical art was manufactured. Cuypers' ecclesiastical work was initially strongly influenced by 13th century French architecture and by the writings of his friends Eugene Viollet-le-Duc and J. A. Alberdingk Thijm. Cuypers built many churches throughout the Netherlands, in which the French influence played a prominent role. Highlights from these first period are the Lambert's Church in Veghel and the in Eindhoven, among others. From 1870 onwards Cuypers' style became more influenced by the native Gothic styles of the Netherlands as well as Gothic styles from other countries like Norway and Italy. He also experimented with centralizing ground-plans and other non- conventional layouts. In this second part of his career he built some of his best work. After 1883 he was assisted by his son Joseph Cuypers in much of his work. Cuypers led many restorations. His conceptions concerning restorations has been frequently criticized; restoration often implied that the building was awfully damaged, but Cuypers tried to satisfy an idealized image of the style or the idea how the original builders had intended a building to be rather than to preserve the architectural evolution of the building. An early example of this is the extensive restoration of the Munster Church in Roermond, where Cuypers replaced original towers with new ones. From 1875 he led the restoration of the eastern front of the Mainz Cathedral, which he executed according to his own plans in Romanesque style. In doing so, he created as an opposite pole to the western tower group the high, gothic likely eastern tower helmet, replacing a bell floor and the Moller iron cupola. Pierre Cuypers was the uncle of Eduard Cuypers who trained in his practice as a young man. Other relatives who became architects are his grandsons Pierre Cuypers jr. and Theo Taen. Cuypers was a practising Roman Catholic and a member of the Lay Dominicans. As such, he was buried in the Dominican habit. He died in his home town of Roermond, aged 93. Bibliography *A. J.

In 1784 he opened the Litchfield Law School, the first law school in the United States, in Litchfield, Connecticut.  Early life  Tapping Reeve was born in Brookhaven, New York, on Long Island, to Reverend Abner Reeve. He graduated from the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) with a bachelor's degree in 1763, and continued on to earn a master's degree in 1766. During his graduate studies at Princeton, Reeve also served as a headmaster of a grammar school in nearby Elizabeth, New Jersey, associated with the college. There, he tutored the two children of the college president, Rev. Aaron Burr Sr.: his son Aaron Burr Jr., a future Vice President of the United States, and his daughter Sarah Burr (known as Sally). Reeve married Sarah Burr on June 4, 1771, when she was 17 years old.  Career  Reeve tutored at Princeton from 1767 to 1770. In 1771 he began to study law with Judge Jesse Root of Hartford, Connecticut. In 1772 he moved to Litchfield, situated on the crossroads of important inland trade routes, to open a new law practice. In 1773, he built a six-room, two-story house. Reeve, while a fervent supporter of the patriot cause, did not enter active service early in the Revolutionary War. His wife's poor health held him at home. However, in December 1776, the Connecticut Assembly called upon him to travel the state to drum up volunteers for the Continental Army. He then accepted a commission as an officer and accompanied his recruits as far as New York before returning to his ailing wife. Litchfield Law School, from a 1906 postcard Reeve took his brother-in-law, Aaron Burr, Jr. as a law student. In the beginning, Aaron Burr lived upstairs and took instruction in the downstairs parlor, adjacent to the gathering room where Reeve held mock court. Also on the first floor was Reeve's private law office. In 1781 Reeve worked with Theodore Sedgwick to represent Elizabeth Freeman (known as Bett), a slave in Sheffield, Massachusetts, in a legal bid for her freedom. Bett had listened to discussions related to the Sheffield Declaration, and to a reading of the 1780 Massachusetts Constitution, the latter containing the phrase \\"all men are born free and equal\\". She then asked Sedgwick to take her case to a local court. Reeve and Sedgwick successfully secured her freedom on constitutional grounds. The case, Brom & Bett v. Ashley, set a precedent that led to the abolition of slavery in Massachusetts. Due in part to notoriety gained from the Elizabeth Freeman case, Reeve's student enrollment began to grow. In 1784, he added a second building (known as the Samuel Seymour House) to house and instruct his law students. Among the students was John C. Calhoun who, like Aaron Burr, became Vice President of the United States. In 1798, Reeve became a judge of Connecticut's Superior Court. He then hired James Gould, a former student, to assist in running the school. Together, they built up the most prominent law school of its time. Reeve is also noted for bringing Reverend Lyman Beecher (father of Harriet Beecher Stowe) to Litchfield in 1810 to serve as a Presbyterian minister for over 25 years, during which time he became notable for his preaching against alcohol and Unitarianism. In 1814, Reeve was appointed Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Connecticut. At this time, Gould took over the law school. Reeve maintained contact with the school until 1820, three years before his death. The school continued to operate until 1833. Reeve's Law of Baron and Femme, first published in 1816, was the preeminent American treatise on family law for much of the 19th century. It underwent revisions and re-publication in 1846, 1867, and 1888.  Personal life and family  Reeve's only child, Aaron Burr Reeve, was born on October 3, 1780. Aaron Burr Reeve went on to graduate from Yale, and became a lawyer in Troy, New York. Sarah Reeve was often in ill health, and died on March 30, 1797. In 1799, Reeve married Elizabeth \\"Betsy\\" Thompson, with whom he had no children. Reeve died on December 13, 1823 in Litchfield, Connecticut, at the age of 79. His home, now known as Tapping Reeve House and Law School, was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1965.

He is considered as one of the most influential criminologists of the 20th century. He was a sociologist of the symbolic interactionist school of thought and is best known for defining white-collar crime and differential association, a general theory of crime and delinquency. Sutherland earned his Ph.D. in sociology from the University of Chicago in 1913. Career Sutherland's historical importance rests upon his having introduced (in a 27 December 1939 speech to the American Sociological Association, titled The White Collar Criminal) the concept of white-collar crime, a concept which violated existing prejudices that aristocrats can do no wrong (which was famously expressed in the ancient legal view that a king could do no wrong). After receiving his PhD from the University of Chicago, Sutherland was at William Jewell College, Missouri (1913‚Äì1919), the University of Kansas (the summer of 1918), University of Illinois (1919‚Äì1925), Sutherland spent a summer at Northwestern (June‚ÄìAugust 1922) prior to arriving at the University of Minnesota in 1925. Sutherland solidified his reputation as one of the country's leading criminologists at the University of Minnesota, where he worked from 1926 to 1929. During this period, he concentrated in sociology as a scientific enterprise whose goal was to understand and control social problems. For several months in 1929 Sutherland studied the British penal system while in England. Also, during 1929‚Äì1930 Sutherland worked as a researcher with the Bureau of Social Hygiene in New York City. In 1930, Sutherland accepted a position as a research professor at the University of Chicago.Criminology Report Article In 1935 he took a position at Indiana University, where he remained till his untimely death on October 11, 1950. He founded the Bloomington School of Criminology at Indiana University. During his time at Indiana, he published four books, including Twenty Thousand Homeless Men (1936), The Professional Thief (1937), the third edition of Principles of Criminology (1939), and the censored first edition of White Collar Crime (1949), his masterpiece. It remained censored until the original text was published in 1983 by Yale University Press. Sutherland was elected president of the American Sociological Society in 1939, and president of the Sociological Research Association in 1940. If he had not already become prominent within the sociological profession prior to his introduction of the concept of white-collar crime in 1939, one can only speculate whether the seminal concept would have been published, as America's largest corporations threatened to sue the publishers of White Collar Crime. (They were successful, and had all references to the names of litigating corporations removed from the text.) When Yale University Press issued the unexpurgated version in 1983, the introduction by Gilbert Geis noted that Sutherland's concept of white- collar crime \\"altered the study of crime throughout the world in fundamental ways\\". Theory He was the author of the leading text Criminology, published in 1924, first stating the principle of differential association in the third edition retitled Principles of Criminology (1939:4‚Äì8) that the development of habitual patterns of criminality arise from association with those who commit crime rather than with those who do not commit crime. The theory also had a structural element positing that conflict and social disorganisation are the underlying causes of crime because they the patterns of people associated with. This latter element was dropped when the fourth edition was published in 1947. But he remained convinced that social class was a relevant factor, coining the phrase white-collar criminal in a speech to the American Sociological Association on December 27, 1939. In his 1949 monograph White- Collar Crime he defined a white-collar crime \\"approximately as a crime committed by a person of respectability and high social status in the course of his occupation.\\" Works *Sutherland, Edwin H.

Wentworthville is located 27 kilometres west of the Sydney central business district and is part of the Greater Western Sydney region. Wentworthville is split between the local government areas of the City of Parramatta and the Cumberland Council. Wentworthville is colloquially known as 'Wenty'. History Wentworthville War Memorial Wentworthville Presbyterian Church Wentworthville, Wentworth Falls in the Blue Mountains and, Wentworth in far western New South Wales, were named after the Wentworth family. A land grant of 2000 acres (8 km¬≤) in this area was made in 1810 to D'Arcy Wentworth, the father of William Wentworth, the famous Australian explorer, barrister, newspaper publisher, politician and landowner. Another pioneer to the area, William Fullagar established the Star Inn on the corner of Ettalong Road and the Western Road (now the Great Western Highway). Fullagar also opened a cattle saleyards which became one of the principal ones for the colony., Pollon, F., (1983), ‚Äò‚ÄôParramatta the cradle city‚Äô‚Äô, p283 () His family's estate \\"Essington House\\" Essington House is now the site of a Christian school. Fullagar Road is named after him. In the mid-1800s, a land boom attracted people into the area, land was subdivided for housing and small farms. Wentworth's holdings were sub-divided - amounting to 600 lots. The railway line had been put through on its way to Penrith, in 1864, but it was not until 1883 that Wentworthville got its own public railway station. Originally the railway station was called T. R. Smith's Platform but was renamed Wentworthville two years later. In 2007 the boundaries were redrawn and the northern part of Wentworthville became the suburb of Constitution Hill.  Heritage listings  Wentworthville has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Caloola Road: Mount Dorothy Reservoir Commercial area Wentworthville has two shopping precincts. The larger, older precinct sits on the Cumberland Council side of Wentworthville railway station (the other side of the railway is part of City of Parramatta Council local government area and is mainly zoned residential). A Supa IGA (formerly Franklins) dominated Wentworthville Mall Shopping Centre until late 2017 when it closed. Wentworthville Mall Supa IGA is no longer there. The newer commercial centre is on the Great Western Highway. It is dominated by Woolworths. Initially Woolworths operated in the main shopping precinct but new premises were obtained at their present location in the late 1980s. An Aldi sits on the other side of the Highway which is part of South Wentworthville. For many years shopping tours were conducted to the Wentworthville area for the factory-outlets selling their products directly to the public. Bonds clothing factory in Dunmore Street sold direct to the public from their factory. Clothing factory closed. Demographics The most common ancestries in Wentworthville were Indian 26.0%, English 9.7%, Australian 9.4%, Chinese 7.1% and Lebanese 3.8%. 35.4% of people were born in Australia. The most common countries of birth were India 26.5%, Sri Lanka 7.8%, China 4.4%, Philippines 2.0% and Lebanon 1.7%. 30.1% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Tamil 11.5%, Gujarati 7.9%, Hindi 7.2%, Punjabi 4.5% and Telugu 4.0%.

Baby swaddled in rabbit robes in cradleboard, Las Vegas The Southern Paiute people is a tribe of Native Americans that have lived in the Colorado River basin of southern Nevada, northern Arizona, and southern Utah. Bands of Southern Paiute live in scattered locations throughout this territory and have been granted federal recognition on several reservations. The first European contact with the Southern Paiute occurred in 1776, when fathers Silvestre V√©lez de Escalante and Francisco Atanasio Dom√≠nguez encountered them during an attempt to find an overland route to the missions of California. They noted that some of the Southern Paiute men \\"had thick beards and were thought to look more in appearance like Spanish men than native Americans\\". Before this date, the Southern Paiute suffered slave raids by the Navajo and the Ute. The arrival of Spanish and later Euro-American explorers into their territory increased slave raiding by other tribes. In 1851, Mormon settlers strategically occupied Paiute water sources, which created a dependency relationship. But, the presence of Mormon settlers soon ended the slave raids, and relations between the Paiutes and the Mormons were basically peaceful. The Mormon missionary Jacob Hamblin worked at diplomatic efforts. The introduction of European settlers and agricultural practices (most especially large herds of cattle) made it difficult for the Southern Paiute to continue their traditional lifestyle, as it drove away the game and reduced their ability to hunt, as well as to gather natural foods. Today Southern Paiute communities are located at Las Vegas, Pahrump, and Moapa, in Nevada; Cedar City, Kanosh, Koosharem, Shivwits, and Indian Peaks, in Utah; at Kaibab and Willow Springs, in Arizona.  Public relations  Due to the policies, treaties, and mistreatment experienced by the Southern Paiute, their history is that of tragedy, dependency, and portrays the consequences of US paternalistic policy towards Native American tribes.https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir;=1&article;=1048&context;=usupress_pubs Yet through it all the Southern Paiutes have portrayed remarkable resilience in preserving their culture, religion, and pride. Even though they've been marginalized and almost decimated from the world population, they managed to make a remarkable retaliation, preserving their priceless culture and heritage. = Early policy = Prior to the 1850s the Paiute people lived relatively peacefully with the other Native American groups. These groups included the Navajo, Ute, and Hopi tribes.Holt, R. L. (October). Paiute Indians. Retrieved October 12, 2018. Though there was the occasional tension and violent outbreaks between the two groups, Paiutes were mainly able to live in peace with other tribes and settlers due to their loose social structure. Most Paiutes lived in small familial groups, and only gathered together in large settings for matters of trade and commerce. Prior to the 1850s their biggest antagonist raiders from competing tribes; such as the Navajos, Utes, and Hopis. The Navajos were particularly notorious for intruding on Paiute grazing land and engaging in brutal raids to capture Paiute women and children for slave trade. Though these raids were harmful, what really crippled the Paiute's was the ‚Äúsettling‚Äù of their tribal lands by US citizens. The most prominent groups to migrate to Paiute lands were members and missionaries from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and silver miners in Pioche, Nevada. To the Paiute people the settling of their lands not only brought a clash of economies and culture, but also a \\"degradation\\" of their sacred land. Prior to the 1860s, there had been no long-term development of the land. Most of the non-native contact they had was with transient militants or traders. Paiutes fought hard to defend their ancestral lands, and at first were successful in driving the settlers out. But in 1869, a rich investor by the name of Fran√ßois Louis Alfred Pioche poured out investment in that town and it seemingly grew overnight to be a booming mining town. In the beginning of its founding, this town depended upon cheap Paiute labor to work in the mines. This caused a dramatic decline in the Paiute population. Another problem the Paiute people faced with these permanent settlers was their desire to ‚ÄúAmericanize‚Äù the Paiute children. Paiute children were mandated to attend American schools where it was attempted to eradicate their old cultural traditions and tendencies. They were forced to learn about US history through the eyes of the US historians; causing them to forget their own culture and changing their historical memories of important coinciding events. The Paiutes, a population of thousands of people, rapidly dwindled to be around sparsely 800 people.Indian Tribe of Utah: History Utahpaiutes.org. Retrieved 7 January 2019. Due to forced relocation, disease, and forced assimilation as time went on the Southern Paiute people started to disappear from the history books. = Modern relations = In the 1950s the Paiutes fell victim to \\"Indian termination policy\\". These policies stripped the Paiutes of their health and educational benefits, federal tax protection, and agricultural assistance. This policy harmed the Paiute people by leaving them on their own in a weak and unstable state.Holt, Ronald L. ‚ÄúPaiute Indians.‚Äù Utah Department of Heritage and Arts, 17 Aug. 2016, heritage.utah.gov/history/uhg-first- peoples-paiute-indians. In the 1980s the first attempt of reconciliation was made in the Restoration Act. This act \\"legally\\" created the \\"Paiute Tribe\\" in the eyes of the US legislator. It united the five main bands into one tribe; the Cedars, Indian Peaks, Kanosh, Koosharem, and Shivwits, and restored them to a system of federal aid and support.  Culture  = Basket weaving = One of the most important skills the women of the Paiute tribes had was their basket weaving skills. They would often use red-stemmed willows to weave their baskets. These skills were used in almost every aspect of their lives, and the skill is believed to have been passed down from mother to daughter for at least 9,000 years. When they would go to gather and forage they would carry large conical baskets on their back to collect things. Specific tools were created Hat, Southern Paiute, collected 1876 - Native American collection - Peabody Museum, Harvard University - DSC05567 including ones to strip fruit off of bushes and trees, ones used for winnowing, and ones used to get to roots better. They would also tightly weave these big baskets with clay and resin to create cooking pots and water jugs. Oftentimes, smaller tools were left behind, whereas bigger products such as cooking pots went with the families as they moved around. Based on the region the families were located determined different uses for the weaving. For instance, those who lived by marshes learned to create duck decoys, nets, and rafts to better hunt the water fowl. Another use for this skill was to create their houses. They would use long thin grasses to tightly weave stalks of Cattails together, and in doing so they created these long board-like sections of grasses that they would set up around long willow limbs stuck in the ground. = Traditional diet = A staple food for the Southern Paiutes was the Bitter root. They also depended on Wild carrot, Wild onion, and chokecherries. Chokecherries were useful in more ways than one- their stems were brewed to make a sweet drink, and their berries would be crushed, then dried to be saved for later. When Aphids came and swarmed the cane plants, they would leave small drops of nectar where they punctured the cane stalk. Knowing this the Southern Paiute women would take the cane rods and beat them until the small dried droplets came loose. These droplets were then tossed in a winnowing dish to be separated from the remnants of the cane. Often these small particles were the main income of sweetness for the people. Another seed they would gather are waada seeds, minuscule black Paiute Indian woman grinding acorns for flour, Lemoore, Kings County, ca.1900 (CHS-922) seeds that would be ground up into meal. Those who lived in a region with an adequate water supply would set up farms, complete with ditch irrigation. The biggest crops were maize, squash and wheat. The men were the primary hunters, they would hunt waterfowl, rabbits, bighorn sheep and other mammals in the regions they passed through. =Paiute Archery= Bows There is a bow collected by the Smithsonian Institution in 1872.Smithsonian Institution, Department of Anthropology, Catalogue Number E-12034-0. Made from a hardwood branch, possibly Mesquite or mountain mahogany, and is 38 5/8 inches from tip to tip. The bow is round in cross section, and the string is two ply sinew. It has a sinew back, and the sinew has been stained with a reddish brown ochre. The bow is utiitarian and still has carving marks, as to be expected of a practical weapon in a hostile and harsh desert environment.Berger, Billy. 2010. \\"Treasures of the Smithsonian. Part V. Archery of the Southwestern United States: Paiute. \\" Primitive Archer. Volume 18 (5). October‚ÄìNovember 2010. Pages 2025.

Notes: Taken in Nebraska, Willard George (left) is showing a relative how to shoot a Paiute bow and arrow. Arrows A set of Paiute arrows was acquired by the Smithsonian Institution in 1874.Smithsonian Institution, Department of Anthropology, Catalogue number E-14539. Only one arrow has a point. The arrowhead is attached by pine pitch glue. There are sinew wrappings behind the point, but they are to prevent the shaft from splitting when the target is hit. The feathers are hawk and buzzard. Quivers and Bowcases A Paiute arrow quiver was acquired by the Smithsonian Institution in 1872.Smithsonian Institution, Department of Anthropology, Catalogue Number E-12038-0. The quiver is made of deerskin with thick hair still on the case, showing the deer was killed in the winter, and is sewn with two ply sinew, much like the bowstring. \\"The quiver is plain, with no decoration, as would be expected of a desert dwelling culture.\\" = Organization of the Southern Paiute people = One important aspect of gathering food was the social aspect, often families would come together for foraging and games and then depart and go their different ways. The Southern Paiutes weren't actually split up into tribes, oftentimes their groups were made up of small family units that would occasionally come together with others to socialize. You would have about 10-50 people in each group, and in each group everyone was related to each other. Family ties were really important to these groups‚Äîit would often determine where they would go and who would support each other‚Äîso marriages were very important to the Southern Paiutes. The leader of the group was called a Headman, and he would be old enough to know a lot about the land, but young enough to still participate in the tribes activities, and he usually had several different family ties within the group. His job was to wake early in the morning, and using his knowledge he would make specific suggestions of what he thought the tribe should do that day, and if people thought his observations were astute they would follow him, if not then they wouldn't. His suggestions would be based on the weather, season, and abundance of food. If over time they stopped following his ideas and instead turned to another, then the Headman leader title would move onto that person. The Headman also was supposed to settle any disputes that came up. Oftentimes different sub-units of the Southern Paiutes would be classified by the settlers coming in from Europe based on what they ate. So you had those who ate waada seeds, those who ate trout, those who ate cattails, etc. = Holy land traditions = The Southern Paiute people believe in Puaxant Tuvip, or power land. It is their holy land that links to many significant landmarks in the Southern Paiutes memory and stories. For instance Nuvagantu, or Mt. Charleston in Nevada is a holy landmark that the Southern Paiute people believe was where they were created. These holy lands were places that the separate families or tribes would come to barter, trade, socialize and perform religious ceremonies. Another large landmark that is culturally significant to the Southern Paiutes is the Colorado river and the Grand Canyon. The modern- day importance of these Holy Lands is that the Southern Paiutes claim the supernaturally given right to know what happens and the impacts of any projects that occur in their holy lands. = Modern-day flag = The Paiutes have a flag that was officially confirmed in 1997. Within it are several symbolisms for the tribe. First the colors, white symbolizes purity, the red and black are both for strength and power, and the yellow for healing and life. The biggest symbol is the eagle which represents their deity, then there are a Flag of the Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah series of images that relate to traditional songs and games the Southern Paiutes would play, the arrowheads that they were known for. Overall the image is supposed to represent a warrior's shield with the five eagle feathers hanging on the bottom representing the 5 modern-day tribes of the Southern Paiutes.  Traditional Southern Paiute bands  The Southern Paiute traditionally had 16 to 31 subgroups, bands, or tribes. * Ankakkani'kacimi (Un-ka-ka'-ni-guts, Unka- kanig-its, Oaw'tuhus'eng), \\"Yellow Mouth of Canyon People\\" in present Long Valley * Antarianunts (Ute name with ending unts); Paiute name Yantar ~~i~~ i, mixed Southern Paiute-Ute band from Escalante River east to Colorado River and southeast to Henry Mountains, Utah * Beaver band (Kwi?umpac√≠ ~~i~~ i, Kwiumpus, Quiumputs), \\"Frasera speciosa people\\", lived in Beaver Valley along Beaver River near today's Beaver, Utah, some intermarried with the Pahvant Ute band to the north living in the deserts near Sevier Lake * Cedar band (Ankappanukkic ~~i~~ cim ~~i~~ ), Unkapanukuints, \\"Red-stream people\\", or Suh‚Äôdutsing, \\"Cedar people\\" from near Cedar City, Utah * Gunlock band (Matooshats, Matissat√Ø was the name given them by the southwards living St. George band/Uainuints, they instead bestowed the term to Southern Paiute bands northeast of them), lived near Gunlock in southwest Utah * Kaibab (Kaipapic ~~i~~ cim ~~i~~ , Kaivavwits, Kaibabits, Kaipa'pici, Kaivavituvingui, \\"Mountain Lying Down People\\" the Kaibab Plateau and Kaibab National Forest in northern Arizona are named after them * Indian Peak Band (Kwee‚Äôchoovunt), \\"Peak People\\" * Kaiparowits, \\"mountain home of the people\\", lived along the Escalante River and were hunting the Kaiparowits Plateau in Utah, therefore also known as Escalante band * Las Vegas band (N ~~i~~ pakant ~~i~~ cim ~~i~~ , Nuaguntits), \\"People of Charleston Peak\\" * Moapa (Moapats), \\"Muddy Creek Paiute\\" * Pahranagat (Pata?nikic ~~i~~ ), \\"Person who sticks his feet in the water, named for the Pahranagat Valley, Nevada * Panaca (Tsouwaraits, Matisabits), named for Panaca, Nevada * Panguitch (Pakiucimi), \\"fish people\\", named for Panguitch, Utah * San Juan band (Kwaiantikowkets), \\"People being over on the opposite side\\", from the San Juan River in northern Arizona * Shivwits (Sipicimi, Shebits, S√ºb√ºts), \\"People who live in the East\\" or See‚Äôveetseng, \\"Whitish Earth People\\" * Uinkaret (Yipinkat ~~i~~ t ~~i~~ cim ~~i~~ ), \\"People of Mount Trumbull\\" * Uainuints (Uenuwunts, also known as Tonaquints, hunted and farmed from Hebron (Shoal Creek Fort), Enterprise and Pinto southward along the Santa Clara River (also called Tonaquint River) to his mouth into the Virgin River south of today's Saint George, Utah, therefore called St. George Band)  Contemporary Southern Paiute federally recognized tribes  * Kaibab Band of Paiute Indians of the Kaibab Indian Reservation, Arizona‚ÄîKaibab Indian Reservation, Arizona * Las Vegas Tribe of Paiute Indians of the Las Vegas Indian Colony, Las Vegas, Nevada * Moapa Band of Paiute Indians of the Moapa River Indian Reservation, Moapa River Indian Reservation, Moapa, Nevada * Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah, Cedar City, Utah ** Cedar City Band of Paiutes ** Kanosh Band of Paiutes ** Koosharem Band of Paiutes ** Indian Peaks Band of Paiutes ** Shivwits Band of Paiutes * San Juan Southern Paiute Tribe of Arizona, Tuba City, Arizona  Notable Southern Paiutes  * Tony Tillohash, linguist and politician  Notes   References   Sources     Further reading  *  External links  = Tribes = * Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah = Language = * Southern Paiute Collection of Charles Cairns at AILLA‚Äîcontains audio recordings of words, phrases, and a story in the Southern Paiute language. = Other = * \\"Removing Classrooms from the Battlefield: Liberty, Paternalism, and the Redemptive Promise of Educational Choice\\", 2008 BYU Law Review 377 * \\"The Piutes and the Legacy of Richard Henry Pratt\\" * Traditional Southern Paiute Territory: Band Divisions * Southern Paiute Tribal Boundary Category:Indigenous peoples of the Great Basin Category:Native American tribes in Arizona Category:Native American tribes in Nevada Category:Native American tribes in Utah Category:Indigenous weapons of the Americas Category:Archery in the United States ","title":"Southern Paiute people"},{"id":"1905281","text":"The Latin Mass Society of England and Wales is a Catholic society dedicated to making the Extraordinary Form of the Roman Rite, also known as the Tridentine Mass, more widely available in England and Wales.

It was fought between the forces of Pyrrhus, king of Epirus in Greece, and the Romans, led by consul Manius Curius Dentatus. It was fought near Beneventum, in southern Italy. It was a strategic (possibly also tactical) Roman victory and Pyrrhus was forced to return to Tarentum, and later to Epirus.P. R. Franke, Cambridge Ancient History, vol. 7, part 2, pp. 481‚Äì483. Background The Pyrrhic War broke out when Pyrrhus, the king of Epirus, in Greece sailed to southern Italy, ostensibly to aid the Greek city of Tarentum in southern Italy in a dispute with the Romans. Ancient historians agreed that his real motive was the conquest of Italy. Besides the Tarentines, three Italic peoples of southern Italy, the Samnites, Lucani and Bruttii, who were in conflict with the Romans, fought alongside the forces of this Greek king. Pyrrhus won two battles (the Battle of Heraclea and the Battle of Asculum) which were highly wasteful for him because he suffered heavy casualties. He realised that he could not sustain more battles with the Romans. They depleted his forces, whereas the pool of military manpower of the Romans was far superior. Consequently, when he was asked by the Greek city-states of eastern and southern Sicily to help them against the Carthaginians in the western part of the island, he accepted and went to Sicily. This aggrieved his allies in southern Italy, who were left to their own devices against the Romans. Pyrrhus seized all the Carthaginian domains except for Lilybaeum, which he failed to capture. He then decided to build a large fleet to attack the Carthaginians in Africa. In order to man and equip this fleet he treated the Greek city-states despotically. Many of them turned against him. This forced him to leave Sicily and return to Italy.Plutarch, Parallel Lives, The life of Pyrrhus, 22.4-6, 11.24Diodorus Siculus, Library of History, 22.10 The battle Plutarch gave the most detailed account of the battle. He wrote that during the three years Pyrrhus spent campaigning in Sicily, the Samnites suffered many defeats at the hands of the Romans and lost a substantial part of their territory. This made them resentful towards Pyrrhus. Therefore, most of them did not join him when he returned to southern Italy. Cassius Dio wrote that the Samnites being hard pressed by the Romans caused Pyrrhus to set forth again to come to their assistance.Cassius Dio, Roman History, 10.6.48 In Plutarch's account, Pyrrhus engaged the Romans despite the lack of Samnite support. The two consuls for 275 BC, Lucius Cornelius Lentulus Caudinus and Manius Curius Dentatus, were fighting in Lucania and Samnium respectively.Plutarch, Parallel Lives, The life of Pyrrhus, 25.1 Plutarch wrote that Pyrrhus divided his forces into two divisions. He sent one of them against Cornelius Lentulus and marched with the other force during the night against Manius Curius, who was encamped near Beneventum and was waiting for help from Cornelius Lentulus. Pyrrhus was in a hurry to engage Manius Curius in case his colleague would show up. However, his soldiers lost their way and fell behind because he went a long way round through woods and his lights did not hold out. Dionysius of Halicarnassus wrote that Pyrrhus marched through \\"long trails that were not even used by people but were mere goat-paths through woods and crags, would keep no order and, even before the enemy came in sight, would be weakened in body by thirst and fatigue.Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Roman antiquities, 20.11\\" This delayed Pyrrhus and at dawn he was in full view of the enemy as he advanced on them from the heights. Plutarch wrote that Manius Curius led his men out of the camp and attacked the enemy advance guard and captured some elephants which were left behind. This success brought him to the plain, where he could engage Pyrrhus in battle on level ground. He routed some of the enemy lines, but an elephant charge drove him back to his camp. He called on the camp guards who were standing on the parapets of the rampart. They came down and threw javelins at the elephants, forcing them to turn round. They ran through the ranks of Pyrrhus which were thrown into disarray and, as a result, the Romans caused the Epirotes to retreat.Plutarch, Parallel Lives, The life of Pyrrhus, 25 Dionysius of Halicarnassus wrote only one sentence about the battle: \\"When Pyrrhus and those with him had ascended along with the elephants, and the Romans became aware of it, they wounded an elephant calf, which caused great confusion and flight among the Greeks. The Romans killed two elephants, and hemming eight others in a place that had no outlet, took them alive when the Indian mahouts surrendered them; and they wrought great slaughter among the soldiers.\\" Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Roman antiquities, 20.12.1 Cassius Dio also related the story of the wounded calf. He wrote that Pyrrhus was put to flight because \\"a young elephant had been wounded, and shaking off its riders, wandered about in search of its mother, whereupon the latter became excited and the other elephants grew turbulent, so that everything was thrown into dire confusion. Finally, the Romans won the day, killing many men and capturing eight elephants, and they occupied the enemy's entrenchments.\\" Cassius Dio, Roman History, 10.6.48 Meanwhile, the Greek historian Polybius, determined that the outcome of the battle was unclear, and the historian Justinus (Roman) stated that the Roman army could not defeat Pyrrhus. And, ancient history also writes that the Romans were divided into two divisions and Pyrrhus was defeated by one of the two armies - that is, he had a larger army, but some later authors (Niese and Schubert) refused. that, perhaps the Romans deliberately devised to celebrate their victory at Beneventum. Aftermath We do not have any information about the number of troops deployed by either side or the number of casualties. After this defeat Pyrrhus went back to Tarentum and gave up the war. He sailed back to Epirus. At the time of the battle this city still had its original name: Maleventum. Six years later (268 BC) the Romans sought to further secure the city and its area by establishing a Roman colony there.Livy Periochae, 15.4; Velleius Paterculus, Compendium of Roman History 1.14.8 The name was changed from Maleventum, a name which the Romans associated with bad omens, as it means ill-come in Latin, to Beneventum, a name, meaning welcome in Latin, which to them had more fortunate connotations.Pliny the Elder, Natural History, 3.11, 16; Livy, The History of Rome, 9.27 References = Primary sources = * Cassius Dio, Roman History, Vol 1, Books 1-11, (Loeb Classical Library), Loeb, 1989; * Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Roman Antiquities, Nabu Press, 2011; * Plutarch, Lives, Vol. 9, Demetrius and Antony.

Description: This micrograph depicts the histopathologic changes associated with rabies encephalitis prepared using an H&E; stain. Note the Negri bodies, which are cellular inclusion bodies found most frequently in the pyramidal cells of Ammon's horn, and the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum. They are also found in the cells of the medulla and various other ganglia. Negri bodies are eosinophilic, sharply outlined, pathognomonic inclusion bodies (2‚Äì10 Œºm in diameter) found in the cytoplasm of certain nerve cells containing the virus of rabies, especially in pyramidal cells within Ammon's horn of the hippocampus. They are also often found in the purkinje cells of the cerebellar cortex from postmortem brain samples of rabies victims. They consist of ribonuclear proteins produced by the virus. They are named for Adelchi Negri. History and use as a Rabies Diagnosis Adelchi Negri, an assistant pathologist working in the laboratory of Camillo Golgi, observed these inclusions in rabbits and dogs with rabies. These findings were presented in 1903 at a meeting of the Societ√† Medico-Chirurgica of Pavia. The American pathologist Anna Wessels Williams made the same discovery, but because Negri published his results first, the bodies bear his name. Negri was convinced the inclusions were a parasitic protozoon and the etiologic agent of rabies. Later that same year, however, Paul Remlinger and Rifat-Bey Frasheri in Constantinople and, separately, Alfonso di Vestea in Naples showed that the etiologic agent of rabies is a filterable virus. Negri continued until 1909 to try to prove that the intraneuronal inclusions named after him corresponded to steps in the developmental cycle of a protozoan. In spite of his incorrect etiologic hypothesis, Negri's discovery represented a breakthrough in the rapid diagnosis of rabies, and the detection of Negri bodies, using a method developed by Anna Wessels Williams, remained the primary way to detect rabies for the next thirty years.

Biography Born Selig Harry Lefkowitz on New York's Lower East Side, Zelig was a well-known pickpocket and thief by age 6. He was a member of Crazy Butch's pickpocket gang before joining the Eastman Gang in the late 1890s. Rising up the ranks, Zelig sought control over the fragmented Eastman Gang in 1908, after \\"Kid Twist\\" (Max Zwerbach) was murdered by a rival. Zelig's crew had more than 75 members, including satellite gangs such as the Lenox Avenue Gang in Harlem, led by \\"Gyp the Blood\\" (aka Harry Horowitz). During this period, when ethnic Jewish gangsters became predominant in the gang, Zelig was also known as \\"The Big Yid\\". =Feud with Sirocco and Tricker= After Zelig was arrested in 1911 for robbing a brothel, Sirocco and Tricker attempted to gain leadership of the gang by refusing to bail out their boss. Zelig was later released due to his political connections. One of his men told him that Sirocco and Tricker were planning on murdering him. The assassin, a gunman named Julie Morrell, was lured by Zelig to The Stuyvesant Casino where he was killed by the gang leader on December 2, 1911. (That building at 140 Second Avenue is now used as the Ukrainian National Home.) The next year, the longstanding Eastman/Five Points feud flared anew. As Zelig left the Criminal Courts building on June 3, 1912, he was shot through the neck by Five Points gunman Charley Torti. He was a known associate of Louis Pioggi, aka Louie the Lump, who had murdered Zelig's mentor, Kid Twist Zwerbach, four years earlier. Zelig had been released on $1000 bail after his arrest for \\"shooting up the saloon\\" of Pioggi's brother Jake. Zelig recovered from his wound in time to be dragged into the Becker/Rosenthal case. =Final years= 225px Charles Becker, a corrupt NYPD lieutenant, had Zelig in his pocket for quite some time. In the summer of 1912, Becker was reported by New York World as one of three corrupt police officers involved in the affairs of Herman Rosenthal. This small-time bookmaker had complained to the press that his illegal businesses had been badly damaged by the greed of the city's corrupt police officers. Becker told Jack Zelig and members of the Lenox Avenue Gang, specifically, Harry \\"Gyp the Blood\\" Horowitz, Jacob \\"Whitey Lewis\\" Seidenshner, Louis \\"Lefty Louie\\" Rosenberg, and Francesco \\"Dago Frank\\" Cirofisi, that he wanted Rosenthal \\"croaked\\". The gambler was gunned down in front of the Hotel Metropole in Times Square on July 16, 1912, two days after his story appeared in the newspapers. In the aftermath, District Attorney Charles S. Whitman made no secret of his belief that the gangsters who killed him had committed the murder at Becker's behest. The fall-out from the Rosenthal murder was huge, making national headlines. All of Big Jack's henchmen were rounded up and charged with murder. It was widely whispered that their boss would testify against them in exchange for leniency. =Death= The day before he could do so, on October 5, 1912, Zelig was shot behind the ear and killed by \\"Boston Red\\" Phil Davidson (of 111 E. 7th Street) while riding on a 2nd Avenue trolley car while passing East 13th Street. Zelig was hanging out at Segal's Cafe (76 Second Avenue, now a church), when he received an anonymous phone call requesting his presence on 14th street. Zelig jumped on the uptown trolley; when he stood up at the intersection of 13th street, Davidson approached him and killed him with a police revolver. Zelig was 24 years old. Davidson ran East on 14th Street where he ran into a police officer on beat patrol who made him drop his weapon.Ferrara, Eric (2008), Gangsters, Murderers & Weirdos of the Lower East Side - a self-guided walking tour Davidson claimed he had shot Zelig over a $400 grudge, but it was popularly believed he had been killed to keep him from testifying against Charles Becker in the Rosenthal murder case involving the Lenox Avenue Gang. Legacy Shortly after Zelig's death New York detective Abe Shoenfeld wrote \\"Jack Zelig is as dead as a door nail. Men before him ‚Äì like Kid Twist, Monk Eastman, and others ‚Äì were as pygmies to a giant. With the passing of Zelig, one of the most 'nerviest', strongest, and best men of his kind left us.\\" References Further reading * Keefe, Rose.

Municipal engineering is concerned with municipal infrastructure. This involves specifying, designing, constructing, and maintaining streets, sidewalks, water supply networks, sewers, street lighting, municipal solid waste management and disposal, storage depots for various bulk materials used for maintenance and public works (salt, sand, etc.), public parks and cycling infrastructure. In the case of underground utility networks, it may also include the civil portion (conduits and access chambers) of the local distribution networks of electrical and telecommunications services. It can also include the optimizing of garbage collection and bus service networks. Some of these disciplines overlap with other civil engineering specialties, however municipal engineering focuses on the coordination of these infrastructure networks and services, as they are often built simultaneously (for a given street or development project), and managed by the same municipal authority. History Modern municipal engineering finds its origins in the 19th-century United Kingdom, following the Industrial Revolution and the growth of large industrial cities. The threat to urban populations from epidemics of waterborne diseases such as cholera and typhus led to the development of a profession devoted to \\"sanitary science\\" that later became \\"municipal engineering\\". A key figure of the so- called \\"public health movement\\" was Edwin Chadwick, author of the parliamentary report, published in 1842. Early British legislation included: *Burgh Police Act 1833 - powers of paving, lighting, cleansing, watching, supplying with water and improving their communities. *Municipal Corporations Act 1835 *Public Health Act 1866 ‚Äì formation of drainage boards *Public Health Act 1875 known at the time as the Great Public Health Act This legislation provided local authorities with powers to undertake municipal engineering projects and to appoint borough surveyors (later known as \\"municipal engineers\\"). In the U.K, the Association of Municipal Engineers, (subsequently named Institution of Municipal Engineers), was established in 1874 under the encouragement of the Institution of Civil Engineers, to address the issue of the application of sanitary science. By the early 20th century, Municipal Engineering had become a broad discipline embracing many of the responsibilities undertaken by local authorities, including roads, drainage, flood control, coastal engineering, public health, waste management, street cleaning, water supply, sewers, waste water treatment, crematoria, public baths, slum clearance, town planning, public housing, energy supply, parks, leisure facilities, libraries, town halls and other municipal buildings. In the UK, the development of different strands of knowledge necessary for the management of municipal infrastructure led to the emergence of separate specialised institutions, including: *For drainage: Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management, 1895 *For town planning: Town Planning Institute 1914 ... subsequently becoming the Royal Town Planning Institute *For street lighting: Association of Public Lighting Engineers, 1934...subsequently becoming the Institution of Lighting Engineers *For highway engineering: Institution of Highways and Transportation, 1930 *For public housing: Institute of Housing, 1931 In 1984 the Institution of Municipal Engineers merged with the Institution of Civil Engineers. Since the 1970s, there has been a global trend toward increasing privatisation and outsourcing of municipal engineering services. In the UK in the 1990s a change in management philosophy brought the demise of the traditional organisational structure of boroughs where the three functions of town clerk, borough treasurer and borough engineer were replaced by an administrative structure with a larger number of specialised departments. In the late 1990s and early 21st century there was increasing dissatisfaction over what was perceived to be fractured and dysfunctional public services designed along narrow specialties. A more holistic approach to urban engineering began to emerge as an alternative concept. Critics of the specialised approach included the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment that complained that the specialised approach to management of the public realm focussed too much on the on efficient movement of vehicles rather than the more general interests of local communities. Professional practice In the United Kingdom there is no longer any formal professional qualification in municipal engineering although there are degree courses available in urban engineering. A professional certificate in Urban Engineering is available from through the Institution of Incorporated Engineers via the Public Realm Information and Advice Network. The British Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) caters to practitioners employed in the public sector, private consultancy and academia through its Proceedings Journal Municipal Engineer. The journal, first published in 1873, has a global scope and covers the whole life cycle of municipal services addressing technical, political and community issues.Jenkinson, Ian. ‚ÄúMunicipal Engineer ‚Äì the silver anniversary‚Äù. Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers, Municipal Engineer, Vol 162, ME2, June 2009, pp65-68. In addition an Expert Panel responds on behalf of ICE to Government consultations and is represented on the International Federation of Municipal Engineering. International organization The International Federation of Municipal Engineering (IFME) is an organisation comprising professional municipal engineers from all round the world. IFME's mission is to connect municipal engineers, public works professionals, public agencies, institutions and businesses around the world in order that they can share a global pool of knowledge and experience. The aim is to foster continued improvement in the quality of public works and wider community services. The inaugural meeting was held in 1960 at the UNESCO headquarters in Paris. Membership has grown steadily and in 2009Buchan, Neil. ‚ÄúBriefing Note - International Federation of Municipal Engineering‚Äù.

Belgium and San Marino are presently Corresponding Members. Related engineering disciplines Municipal or urban engineering combines elements of environmental engineering, water resources engineering and transport engineering. Relationship to urban design or urban planning Today, municipal engineering may be confused with urban design or urban planning. Whereas the urbanist or urban planner may design the general layout of streets and public places, the municipal engineer is concerned with the detailed design. For example, in the case of the design of a new street, the urbanist may specify the general layout of the street, including landscaping, surface finishings and urban accessories, but the municipal engineer will prepare the detailed plans and specifications for the roads, sidewalks, municipal services and street lighting. Site civil works In the case of large buildings or plants, facilities or campuses, site civil works may be required that are similar in scope or type as municipal infrastructure, namely, access roads, parking lots, potable water supply (including fire hydrants), on-site waste water treatment plants, site drainage including sedimentation and retention ponds or basins, etc. In most engineering consulting firms, Structural Engineering and Municipal Infrastructure are typically separate departments. On a large construction project, the civil engineering design will typically be divided into a structural portion, designed by structural engineers and typically focused on the buildings, and \\"civil\\" portion, designed by municipal engineers and focused on the site.

NBCUniversal formally announced that it would sell its stake back to ValueVision Media in May 2010,NBC to Sell Stake in ShopNBC, MultiChannel News, May 20, 2010 but ultimately decided in June 2010 to retain its stake in the company. ValueVision acquired NBCUniversal's financial stake in the company in 2013, and announced the network would be renamed ShopHQ (visually branded as SHQP). Mark Cuban's American Dream aired on the network in 2014, and was part of a plan under the Clinton Group management to feature more celebrity hosts. =Evine= On February 13, 2015, the ShopHQ network was rebranded as EVINE Live, following ValueVision Media's acquisition of e-commerce company Dollars Per Minute, the owner of the EVINE trademark, in order to distance itself from the reputation it held under ValueVision/ShopNBC/ShopHQ. The network hired former QVC host Kathy Levine, and has featured merchandise branded under different reality TV stars, including Lisa Vanderpump and Countess Luann DeLesseps. The company has also premiered concepts from other well-known celebrities, including Paula Deen, Vanessa Williams, Nancy O‚ÄôDell, Holly Robinson Peete, Karen Fairchild, Dr. Terry Dubrow and Heather Dubrow, Todd English, Donny Osmond and Bob Vila. It also sells products on its e-commerce website, Evine.com. EVINE Live launched a high definition feed of the channel in 1080i (including the acquisition of HD tier channel slots under new carriage agreements) the same year, but until September 2017, remained in standard definition, merely rebroadcasting the SD feed. The network converted to an upscaled standard definition widescreen presentation in the fall of 2016, and quietly upgraded to HD a year after. In July 2016, EVINE dropped 'Live' from their on-air name. =Return to ShopHQ= On July 17, 2019, Evine Live Inc. began doing business under the new corporate banner of iMedia Brands Inc, with their shares traded under a new ticker of IMBI; Invicta Watch Group (which has a number of hours on the network as its largest vendor) invested an additional $6 million into the company. The television network returned to the ShopHQ name effective August 21, which the company used between 2013 and 2015, with the cited reason being market research suggesting confusion with the \\"E\\" name being confused for an entertainment news brand such as E! or Entertainment Tonight. The company announced plans to launch a Spanish-speaking shopping channel called LaVenta Shopping Network, along with the male-focused Bulldog Shopping Network, itself a rebranding of evine TOO, a timeshift channel with only minimum cable distribution. Though the channel slot for Bulldog Shopping Network was activated in the spring of 2020, its focused was quickly changed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Typical self-sealing tanks have multiple layers of rubber and reinforcing fabric, one of vulcanized rubber, and one of untreated natural rubber, which can absorb fuel, swell, and expand when it comes into contact with the fuel. When a fuel tank is punctured, the fuel seeps into the layers, causing the untreated layer to swell and thus seal the puncture. A similar concept is also employed for making self-sealing run-flat tires. World War I George J. Murdock applied for the patent \\"War Aeroplane Fuel Tanks\\" on February 7, 1917 but was temporarily blocked by an order of the Federal Trade Commission, on February 6, 1918, to keep any discussion or publication of the invention secret. The order was rescinded by the United States Patent Office on September 26, 1918 and Murdock was eventually granted United States Patent 1,386,791 \\"Self- Puncture Sealing Covering for Fuel-Containers\\" on August 9, 1921. Military aircraft built by the Glenn L. Martin Company used this self-sealing fuel tank. Howard Hughes used neoprene to self-seal his fuel tanks on his 1938 around the world flight. World War II In the newer generations of pre-war and early-war aircraft, self-sealing tanks were tanks used to minimize the damage from leaking or burning fuel. A conventional fuel tank, when hit by gunfire, could leak fuel rapidly. This would not only reduce the aircraft's effective range, but was also a significant fire hazard. Damaged fuel tanks could also rupture, destroying the airframe or critically affecting flight characteristics. It was realized that, because of weight limitations, it was not practical to simply add armor plate to aircraft fuel tanks; a method of stopping fuel leaking from damaged tanks was necessary. Early attempts at protecting fuel tanks consisted of using metal tanks, covered inside or outside by a material that expanded after being pierced. Research revealed that the exit of the projectile, rather than the entry, was the greater problem, as it often tumbled, thus creating a large exit hole. Among the earliest versions of these types of tanks were those manufactured in the UK at Portsmouth airport by Fireproof Tanks Ltd. These tanks were first installed in the Fairey Battle light bomber with other versions installed in Supermarine Spitfire and Hawker Hurricane fighters and larger aircraft such as the Avro Lancaster heavy bomber. The Henderson Safety Tank company provided crash-proof self-sealing tanks for the Miles Master trainer. The Germans were using layers of rubber laid over leather hide with a treated fibre inner surface for the self-sealing tanks on their Junkers Ju 88 bombers early in the war. Manufacture of self-sealing gas tanks at Goodyear (1941) In the US, Ernst Eger of United States Rubber Company (later Uniroyal) patentedPuncture Sealing Gas Tank a self-sealing fuel tank design in 1941; one of many companies involved in developing this technology during the war. Elmo E Hanson, lead chemist for Firestone Tire and Rubber Company filed a patent for self sealing tanks on January 21, 1941, Patent number 2,404,766. Goodyear chemist James Merrill filed a patent in 1941 (published in 1947) for refining and successfully testing his method for manufacturing self-sealing tanks using a two-layer system of rubber compounds encased in a metal outer shell or the wing lining of the aircraft. USPTO text and images In 1942, he received a War Production Board citation from President Roosevelt and the Goodyear tanks were subsequently placed in service in Goodyear-produced Corsair fighters, as well as other aircraft. By 1942 Fireproof Tanks had developed the first flexible fuel bladders as range extender tanks for the Mk IX Spitfire. These tanks were flexible containers, made of a laminated self-sealing material like vulcanized rubber and with as few seams as possible to minimize leak paths. As early tests showed that impact could overpressurize a fuel tank, the self-sealing fuel cell is suspended, allowing it to absorb shocks without rupture. U.S. Navy fuel tanks during the war were able to withstand bullets and, on occasion, cannon shells. Not all fighters were fitted with the relatively new invention. Self-sealing tanks tended to be heavier with lower capacity than non-sealed tanks. Nonetheless, aircraft that were fitted with self-sealing tanks regularly took more punishment than those without, and were able to return to base. Combat experience in the Pacific war showed that the heavily protected American aircraft could sustain far more damage than the lightly armored Japanese designs without self-sealing fuel tanks (for instance, the Mitsubishi A6M Zero). The same principles were applied to give self-sealing fuel lines in aircraft (MIL-PRF-7061C). Modern use Most jet fighters and all US military rotary wing aircraft have some type of self-sealing tanks. Military rotary wing fuel tanks have the additional feature of being crashworthy.A Study of Helicopter Crash-Resistant Fuel Systems High altitudes require the tanks to be pressurized, making self-sealing difficult. Newer technologies have brought advances like inert foam-filled tanks to prevent detonation. This foam is an open cell foam that effectively divides the gas space above the remaining fuel into thousands of small spaces, none of which contain sufficient vapour to support combustion. This foam also serves to reduce fuel slosh. Major manufacturers of this technology include Hutchinson, Amfuel (Zodiac) (formerly Firestone), Meggitt (formerly Goodyear), Robertson Fuel Systems, GKN USA, and FPT Industries. FPT is now part of GKN. For military use, tanks are qualified to MIL-DTL-27422 (includes crashworthiness requirements) or MIL-DTL-5578 (non-crashworthy).

History =VIA Rail Canada= The Rocky Mountaineer began as a once weekly VIA Rail daytime service between Calgary, Jasper and Vancouver on June 9, 1988, called the 'Canadian Rockies by Daylight.'. This service was the same as it is today, with an overnight stop in Kamloops. Trains departed Vancouver on Sundays, with trains to Jasper and Calgary (by way of Banff) departing Monday morning. These were express services, with no intermediate stops. Return service began westward on Thursdays from Calgary and Jasper, terminating on Friday in Vancouver. On June 4, 1989, VIA began its second season of the service, renamed the service the 'Rocky Mountaineer.' Scheduling remained the same as the previous season. The final Summer Rocky Mountaineer under VIA branding departed Calgary and Jasper on October 12, 1989, and arrived in Vancouver on October 13. VIA Rail experienced massive reductions in scheduling in 1990, resulting in the Southern transcontinental service being terminated. Service on the Rocky Mountaineer continued through the winter of 1990, being removed from schedules and marketing in May 1990. =Private operation= After the sale of the branding in 1990, the current company was founded by the Armstrong Group in 1990, and is based in Vancouver, British Columbia. It ran its first train on May 27, 1990. It is the busiest privately owned passenger rail service in North America, having transported over one million passengers since 1990.  Controversy  In July 2020, the company announced the suspension of its service for the remainder of the 2020 season in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. The company's decision to refuse to issue passenger refunds, contrary to its published cancellation policy at the time of ticket purchase, has generated negative media attention. In October 2020, a Toronto CTV consumer alert article reported over 200 passengers were still fighting for compensation from The Rocky Mountaineer. Awards Rocky Mountaineer has been awarded the \\"World's Leading Travel Experience by Train\\" at the World Travel Awards seven times for its GoldLeaf service and was recognized by National Geographic Magazine as one of the \\"World‚Äôs Best Journeys\\" in 2007. The Society of American Travel Writers, the world's largest organization of professional travel journalists and photographers, rated the Rocky Mountaineer as the world's top train ride in 2009. Equipment The Rocky Mountaineer boards passengers at Banff, Alberta, showing its former livery. Jasper Rocky Mountaineer operates over 75 railcars in its fleet: * GP40-2L locomotives, ex- Canadian National Railway, rebuilt by GEC - Alstom * 32 \\"RedLeaf\\" Canada Car and Foundry single deck coaches, ex-Canadian National Railway. * 6 \\"SilverLeaf\\" single-level dome coaches, rebuilt from RedLeaf coaches. * 16 \\"GoldLeaf\\" Colorado Railcar bi-level Ultra Dome coaches, with wrap-over view windows on the top level. * 10 \\"GoldLeaf\\" Stadler bi-level glass domed coaches, with restaurant and kitchen in the lower level. Previous equipment: GE B36-7 locomotives leased from BC Rail. Routes Rocky Mountaineer operates train journeys over three principal routes: First passage to the West: This route travels along Kicking Horse River, terminating in Banff. Rocky Mountaineer is the only passenger rail service that operates on this route after the cancellation of VIA Rail's southern transcontinental service. Journey through the clouds: This route travels through the Coastal Mountain Range and the Fraser Canyon. The train follows the route of the Fraser River, then the North Thompson, terminating in Jasper. Rainforest to Gold Rush: This is a three-day route which begins in North Vancouver, with stops in Whistler and Quesnel. The route terminates in Jasper. Service levels Upper level of Rocky Mountaineer GoldLeaf Lower dining level on GoldLeaf =GoldLeaf= Operating on all routes, Rocky Mountaineer's GoldLeaf service is a custom- designed, bi-level, glass-domed coach with full-length windows and reclining seats that can be rotated to accommodate groups of four. Guests on board this service are attended to by three to four onboard hosts, in addition to the culinary team. Guests are offered hot meals prepared on board the train, served to them in the lower level dining car. Beverages and snacks are also offered to guests throughout the journey. The two levels of the GoldLeaf coach are accessible by a spiral staircase or an ADA elevator.Source: Rocky Mountaineer ‚Äì 25 Years of Life Changing Experiences ‚Äì 2015 Canada Train travel Guide (page 19) Rocky Mountaineer SilverLeaf =SilverLeaf= Operating on the same routes as GoldLeaf, Rocky Mountaineer's SilverLeaf service is a custom- designed, single level glass domed coach with oversized windows and reclining seats. Guests onboard are attended to by two to three onboard hosts, and offered a hot entr√©e option for breakfast and lunch served at their seat and plated to their preference. Complimentary beverages are served throughout the journey, including: wine, beer, spirits, and non-alcoholic drinks. Gourmet snacks are also offered throughout the journey. Trip structure To allow for the best views, Rocky Mountaineer operates exclusively during the day. On the First Passage to the West and on Journey Through the Clouds routes an overnight stop is made in Kamloops. On the Rainforest to Gold Rush route, there are two overnight stops in Whistler and Quesnel. The Rocky Mountaineer season runs from mid-April to mid-October with multiple departures every week going both eastbound and westbound. Connecting services Banff and Kamloops The nearest international airports to Rocky Mountaineer are the Calgary International Airport and Vancouver International Airport. In Vancouver, Rocky Mountaineer trains depart from the Rocky Mountaineer Station, while other rail services operate out of either Pacific Central Station (Amtrak and Via Rail) or Waterfront Station (West Coast Express). At the Jasper railway station passengers can transfer directly to Via Rail's Canadian and Jasper ‚Äì Prince Rupert train service.

It is a part of Swire's property business, along with Taikoo Place, the adjacent Cityplaza retail and office complex and EAST, a lifestyle business hotel.  Etymology  Taikoo is the Cantonese pronunciation of Swire's Chinese name, while Shing can be literally translated as City. Thus, Taikoo Shing can be loosely translated as Swire City. According to Swire, its Chinese name Taikoo was chosen by Thomas Taylor Meadow, the British Consul in Shanghai when Swire‚Äôs Shanghai office opened in 1866. Area Taikoo Shing dock plaque now within the Cityplaza area The entire Taikoo Shing estate covers 21.5 hectares (53 acres), and consists of 61 residential towers, with a total of 12,698 apartment flats that ranges anywhere between to . History The Taikoo Shing estate was once the site of Taikoo Dockyard, whose foundation stone now lies beside Cityplaza. The dockyard moved to United Dockyards at the west shore of the Tsing Yi Island in the late 1970s, and Taikoo Shing was constructed over the site in stages, with constructions of all main residential buildings complete by the early 1990s. As part of the business strategy, Swire Properties was established in 1972 immediately after the closing of the dockyard. Taikoo Shing became one of Hong Kong's first major private housing estates. Completing in 1986, Swire immediately became one of the largest property companies doing the construction themselves.Jones, Geoffrey. [2000] (2000). Merchants to Multinationals: British Trading Companies in the 19th and 20th Centuries. Oxford University Press. The area was designed to maximise middle-class residential capacity. Development of commercial areas still continues today. After the completion of Cityplaza 3 and 4 as office buildings, the original Cityplaza 1 was demolished in the mid-90s for redevelopment. As of 2007, the food market that was originally constructed was demolished to make room for a hotel. Population and demographics In the 2011 census, Taikoo Shing recorded 36,796 residents. The median monthly rent among rental households was $18,000. Apartment flats in Taikoo Shing are popular amongst buyers and speculators, and for a significant time in the 1980s and 1990s, Taikoo Shing's housing price is a general indicator of the Hong Kong's housing market health in general. Although in recent years, newer housing developments have eroded a bit of Taikoo Shing's once prominent status. The estate is also a very sought- after place to live for the Japanese and Korean expatriate communities in Hong Kong, most of which are staffed in multinational corporations based in Hong Kong. As a result of this significant Korean and Japanese settlement, the area has many Korean and Japanese-themed service establishments. Housing Taikoo Shing housing map The housing in Taikoo Shing was developed in stages, with the Tsui Woo Terrace being the first ones constructed. In all, the estate's housing complexes are broken down into 6 terraces and 2 gardens, each with a special naming scheme.

The inclusion of a self- interaction term represents a fundamental alteration of quantum mechanics. It can be written either as a single integro-differential equation or as a coupled system of a Schr√∂dinger and a Poisson equation. In the latter case it is also referred to in the plural form. The Schr√∂dinger‚ÄìNewton equation was first considered by Ruffini and Bonazzola in connection with self-gravitating boson stars. In this context of classical general relativity it appears as the non-relativistic limit of either the Klein‚ÄìGordon equation or the Dirac equation in a curved space-time together with the Einstein field equations. The equation also describes fuzzy dark matter, and approximates classical cold dark matter described by the Vlasov‚ÄìPoisson equation in the limit that the particle mass is large. Later on it was proposed as a model to explain the quantum wave function collapse by Lajos Di√≥si and Roger Penrose, from whom the name \\"Schr√∂dinger‚ÄìNewton equation\\" originates. In this context, matter has quantum properties while gravity remains classical even at the fundamental level. The Schr√∂dinger‚ÄìNewton equation was therefore also suggested as a way to test the necessity of quantum gravity. In a third context, the Schr√∂dinger‚ÄìNewton equation appears as a Hartree approximation for the mutual gravitational interaction in a system of a large number of particles. In this context, a corresponding equation for the electromagnetic Coulomb interaction was suggested by Philippe Choquard at the 1976 Symposium on Coulomb Systems in Lausanne to describe one-component plasmas. Elliott H. Lieb provided the proof for the existence and uniqueness of a stationary ground state and referred to the equation as the Choquard equation.  Overview  As a coupled system, the Schr√∂dinger‚ÄìNewton equations are the usual Schr√∂dinger equation with a self- interaction gravitational potential : \\\\mathrm{i}\\\\hbar \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\Psi}{\\\\partial t} = -\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m} abla ^2 \\\\Psi + V \\\\Psi + m \\\\Phi \\\\Psi \\\\,, where V is an ordinary potential and the gravitational potential \\\\Phi, representing the interaction of the particle with its own gravitational field, satisfies the Poisson equation : abla^2 \\\\Phi = 4 \\\\pi G m \\\\Psi^2 \\\\,. Because of the back coupling of the wave-function into the potential it is a nonlinear system. The integro-differential form of the equation is :\\\\mathrm{i}\\\\hbar \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\Psi}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\left[-\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m} abla ^2 + V - G m^2 \\\\int \\\\frac{  \\\\Psi(t,\\\\mathbf{y}) ^2}{\\\\mathbf{x} - \\\\mathbf{y}} \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}^3 \\\\mathbf{y}\\\\right] \\\\Psi \\\\,. It is obtained from the above system of equations by integration of the Poisson equation under the assumption that the potential must vanish at infinity. Mathematically, the Schr√∂dinger‚ÄìNewton equation is a special case of the Hartree equation for n = 2. The equation retains most of the properties of the linear Schr√∂dinger equation. In particular it is invariant under constant phase shifts, leading to conservation of probability, and it exhibits full Galilei invariance. In addition to these symmetries, a simultaneous transformation :m \\\\to \\\\mu m, \\\\; t \\\\to \\\\mu^{-5} t, \\\\; \\\\; \\\\mathbf{x} \\\\to \\\\mu^{-3} \\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\; \\\\; \\\\psi(t, \\\\mathbf{x}) \\\\to \\\\mu^{9/2} \\\\psi(\\\\mu^5 t, \\\\mu^3 \\\\mathbf{x}) maps solutions of the Schr√∂dinger‚ÄìNewton equation to solutions. The stationary equation, which can be obtained in the usual manner via a separation of variables, possesses an infinite family of normalisable solutions of which only the stationary ground state is stable. = Relation to semiclassical and quantum gravity = The Schr√∂dinger‚ÄìNewton equation can be derived under the assumption that gravity remains classical, even at the fundamental level, and that the right way to couple quantum matter to gravity is by means of the semiclassical Einstein equations. In this case, a Newtonian gravitational potential term is added to the Schr√∂dinger equation, where the source of this gravitational potential is the expectation value of the mass density operator. In this regard, if gravity is fundamentally classical, the Schr√∂dinger‚ÄìNewton equation is a fundamental one-particle equation, which can be generalised to the case of many particles (see below). If, on the other hand, the gravitational field is quantised, the fundamental Schr√∂dinger equation remains linear. The Schr√∂dinger‚ÄìNewton equation is then only valid as an approximation for the gravitational interaction in systems of a large number of particles, and has no effect on the centre of mass.  Many- body equation and centre-of-mass motion  If the Schr√∂dinger‚ÄìNewton equation is considered as a fundamental equation, there is a corresponding N-body equation that was already given by Di√≥si, and can be derived from semiclassical gravity in the same way as the one-particle equation: :\\\\begin{align}\\\\mathrm{i}\\\\hbar\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\Psi(t,\\\\mathbf{x_1},\\\\dots,\\\\mathbf{x_N})}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\Bigg(&-\\\\sum_{i=1}^N\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2 m_i} abla_i^2 + \\\\sum_{i ot=j} V_{ij}(\\\\mathbf{x_i}-\\\\mathbf{x_j})\\\\\\\\\\\\ & -G\\\\sum_{i,j=1}^N m_i m_j \\\\int \\\\mathrm{d}^3 \\\\mathbf{y_1} \\\\cdots \\\\mathrm{d}^3 \\\\mathbf{y_N} \\\\, \\\\frac{\\\\Psi(t,\\\\mathbf{y_1},\\\\dots,\\\\mathbf{y_N})^2}{\\\\mathbf{x_i}-\\\\mathbf{y_j}} \\\\Bigg) \\\\Psi(t,\\\\mathbf{x_1},\\\\dots,\\\\mathbf{x_N})\\\\,.\\\\end{align} The potential V_{ij} contains all the mutual linear interactions, e.g. electrodynamical Coulomb interactions, while the gravitational potential term is based on the assumption that all particles perceive the same gravitational potential generated by all the marginal distributions for all the particles together. In a Born‚ÄìOppenheimer-like approximation, this N-particle equation can be separated into two equations, one describing the relative motion, the other providing the dynamics of the centre-of-mass wave-function. For the relative motion, the gravitational interaction does not play a role, since it is usually weak compared to the other interactions represented by V_{ij}. But it has a significant influence on the centre-of-mass motion. While V_{ij} only depends on relative coordinates and therefore does not contribute to the centre-of-mass dynamics at all, the nonlinear Schr√∂dinger‚ÄìNewton interaction does contribute. In the aforementioned approximation, the centre-of-mass wave- function satisfies the following nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation: :\\\\mathrm{i}\\\\hbar\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\psi_c(t,\\\\mathbf{R})}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\Bigg(\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2 M} abla^2 -G \\\\int \\\\mathrm{d}^3 \\\\mathbf{R'} \\\\, \\\\int \\\\mathrm{d}^3 \\\\mathbf{y} \\\\, \\\\int \\\\mathrm{d}^3 \\\\mathbf{z} \\\\, \\\\frac{\\\\psi_c(t,\\\\mathbf{R'})^2 \\\\, \\\\rho_c(\\\\mathbf{y})\\\\rho_c(\\\\mathbf{z})}{\\\\mathbf{R}-\\\\mathbf{R'} - \\\\mathbf{y} + \\\\mathbf{z}} \\\\Bigg) \\\\psi_c(t,\\\\mathbf{R}) \\\\, where M is the total mass, R is the relative coordinate, \\\\psi_c the centre-of-mass wave-function, and \\\\rho_c is the mass density of the many-body system (e.g. a molecule or a rock) relative to its centre of mass. In the limiting case of a wide wave-function, i.e. where the width of the centre-of-mass distribution is large compared to the size of the considered object, the centre-of-mass motion is approximated well by the Schr√∂dinger‚ÄìNewton equation for a single particle. The opposite case of a narrow wave-function can be approximated by a harmonic oscillator potential, where the Schr√∂dinger‚ÄìNewton dynamics leads to a rotation in phase space. In the context where the Schr√∂dinger‚ÄìNewton equation appears as a Hartree approximation, the situation is different. In this case the full N-particle wave-function is considered a product state of N single-particle wave-functions, where each of those factors obeys the Schr√∂dinger‚ÄìNewton equation. The dynamics of the centre-of-mass, however, remain strictly linear in this picture. This is true in general: nonlinear Hartree equations never have an influence on the centre of mass.  Significance of effects  A rough order-of-magnitude estimate of the regime where effects of the Schr√∂dinger‚ÄìNewton equation become relevant can be obtained by a rather simple reasoning. For a spherically-symmetric Gaussian, :\\\\Psi(t=0,r) = (\\\\pi \\\\sigma^2)^{-3/4} \\\\exp\\\\left(-\\\\frac{r^2}{2 \\\\sigma^2}\\\\right) \\\\,, the free linear Schr√∂dinger equation has the solution :\\\\Psi(t,r) = (\\\\pi \\\\sigma^2)^{-3/4} \\\\left(1+\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{i}\\\\hbar t}{m \\\\sigma^2}\\\\right)^{-3/2} \\\\exp\\\\left(-\\\\frac{r^2}{2 \\\\sigma^2 \\\\left(1+\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{i}\\\\hbar t}{m \\\\sigma^2}\\\\right)}\\\\right) \\\\,. The peak of the radial probability density 4 \\\\pi r^2 \\\\Psi^2 can be found at :r_p = \\\\sigma \\\\sqrt{1+\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2 t^2}{m^2 \\\\sigma^4}}\\\\,. Now we set the acceleration :\\\\ddot{r}_p = \\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{m^2 r_p^3} of this peak probability equal to the acceleration due to Newtonian gravity, :\\\\ddot{r} = -\\\\frac{G m}{r^2}\\\\,, using that r_p = \\\\sigma at time t=0. This yields the relation :m^3 \\\\sigma = \\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{G} \\\\approx 1.7 \\\\times 10^{-58} \\\\mathrm{m\\\\,kg^3} \\\\,, which allows us to determine a critical width for a given mass value and vice versa. We also recognise the scaling law mentioned above. Numerical simulations show that this equation gives a rather good estimate of the regime where effects of the Schr√∂dinger‚ÄìNewton equation become significant. For an atom the critical width is around 1022 metres, while it is already down to 10‚àí31 metres for a mass of one microgram. The regime where the mass is around 1010 atomic mass units while the width is of the order of micrometers is expected to allow for an experimental test of the Schr√∂dinger‚ÄìNewton equation in the future. A possible candidate are interferometry experiments with heavy molecules, which currently reach masses up to 10,000 atomic mass units.  Quantum wave function collapse  The idea that gravity causes (or somehow influences) the wavefunction collapse dates back to the 1960s and was originally proposed by K√°rolyh√°zy. The Schr√∂dinger‚ÄìNewton equation was proposed in this context by Di√≥si. There the equation provides an estimation for the \\"line of demarcation\\" between microscopic (quantum) and macroscopic (classical) objects. The stationary ground state has a width of :a_0 \\\\approx \\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{G m^3} \\\\,. For a well- localised homogeneous sphere, i.e. a sphere with a centre-of-mass wave- function that is narrow compared to the radius of the sphere, Di√≥si finds as an estimate for the width of the ground-state centre-of-mass wave-function :a_0^{(R)} \\\\approx a_0^{1/4} R^{3/4} \\\\,. Assuming a usual density around 1000 kg/m¬≥, a critical radius can be calculated for which a_0^{(R)} \\\\approx R. This critical radius is around a tenth of a micrometer. Roger Penrose proposed that the Schr√∂dinger‚ÄìNewton equation mathematically describes the basis states involved in a gravitationally induced wavefunction collapse scheme. Penrose suggests that a superposition of two or more quantum states which have a significant amount of mass displacement ought to be unstable and reduce to one of the states within a finite time. He hypothesises that there exists a \\"preferred\\" set of states which could collapse no further, specifically the stationary states of the Schr√∂dinger‚ÄìNewton equation. A macroscopic system can therefore never be in a spatial superposition since the nonlinear gravitational self-interaction immediately leads to a collapse to a stationary state of the Schr√∂dinger‚ÄìNewton equation. According to Penrose's idea, when a quantum particle is measured, there is an interplay of this nonlinear collapse and environmental decoherence. The gravitational interaction leads to the reduction of the environment to one distinct state and decoherence leads to the localisation of the particle, e.g. as a dot on a screen. = Problems and open matters = Three major problems occur with this interpretation of the Schr√∂dinger‚ÄìNewton equation as the cause of the wave-function collapse. First, numerical studies agreeingly find that when a wave packet \\"collapses\\" to a stationary solution, a small portion of it seems to run away to infinity. This would mean that even a completely collapsed quantum system still can be found at a distant location. Since the solutions of the linear Schr√∂dinger equation tend towards infinity even faster, this only indicates that the Schr√∂dinger‚ÄìNewton equation alone is not sufficient to explain the wave- function collapse. If the environment is taken into account, this effect might disappear and therefore not be present in the scenario described by Penrose. A second problem, also arising in Penrose's proposal, is the origin of the Born rule. To solve the measurement problem, a mere explanation why a wave-function collapses to, e.g., a dot on a screen is not enough. A good model for the collapse process also has to explain why the dot appears on different positions of the screen with probabilities that are determined by the absolute-value squared of the wave-function. Although it might be possible that a model based on Penrose's idea could provide such an explanation, there is no evident way how the Born rule could arise naturally from it. Finally, since the gravitational potential is linked to the wave-function in the picture of the Schr√∂dinger‚ÄìNewton equation, the wave-function must be interpreted as a real object. Therefore, at least in principle, it becomes a measurable quantity. Making use of the nonlocal nature of entangled quantum systems, this could be used to send signals faster than light, which is generally thought to be in contradiction with causality. It is, however, not clear if this problem can be resolved by applying the right collapse prescription, yet to be found, consistently to the full quantum system. Also, since gravity is such a weak interaction, it is not clear that such an experiment can be actually performed within the parameters given in our universe (cf. the discussion about a similar thought experiment proposed by Eppley and Hannah).

They were named after Robert Browne, who was born at Tolethorpe Hall in Rutland, England, in the 1550s. A majority of the Separatists aboard the Mayflower in 1620 were Brownists, and indeed the Pilgrims were known for 200 years as the Brownist Emigration. Origins There had been early advocates of a congregational form of organization for the Church of England in the time of Henry VIII. It became clear that the English government had other plans on the re-establishment of the Anglican Church, after the Catholic Mary's reign, and these dissenters looked towards setting up a separate church. The first wave of separatism from the Elizabethan Church of England came in London after March 1566, when Archbishop Parker enforced strict adherence to the Prayer Book and 14 ministers were deprived. Some of the most radical led their followers in forming the London Underground Church, meeting in secret locations. From possibly a thousand members at its height, this movement shrank, through imprisonment and deaths, to a small group of members in Browne's days. He and Harrison knew of the London church, but seem to have believed it had died. Browne's leadership Robert Browne (d. 1633) was a student who became an Anglican priest late in life. At Cambridge University, he was influenced by Puritan theologians, including Thomas Cartwright (1535-1603). Browne became a Lecturer at St Mary's Church, Islington where his dissident preaching against the doctrines and disciplines of the Church of England began to attract attention. During 1578, Browne returned to Cambridge University and came under the influence of Richard Greenham, puritan rector of Dry Drayton. He encouraged Browne to complete his ordination and serve at a parish church. Browne was offered a lecturer position at St Bene't's Church, Cambridge possibly through Greenham, but his tenure there was short. Browne came to reject the puritan view of reform from within the Church, and started to look outside the established Church. In 1581, Browne had become the leader of this movement and, in Norwich, attempted to set up a separate Congregational Church outside the Church of England. He was arrested but released on the advice of William Cecil, his kinsman. Browne and his companions left England and moved to Middelburg in the Netherlands later in 1581. There they organised a church on what they conceived to be the New Testament model, but the community broke up within two years owing to internal dissensions. His most important works were published at Middelburg in 1582: A Treatise of Reformation without Tarying for Anie, in which he asserted the right of the church to effect necessary reforms without the authorisation of the civil magistrate; and A Booke which sheweth the life and manners of all True Christians, which set out the theory of Congregational independence. Two men were hanged at Bury St Edmunds in 1583 for circulating them. Browne was only an active Separatist from 1579-1585. He returned to England and to the Church of England, being employed as a schoolmaster and, after 1591, a Church of England parish priest. He was much engaged in controversy with some of those who held his earlier separatist position and who now looked upon him as a renegade. In particular, he replied to John Greenwood and Henry Barrowe several times. He is buried in St Giles's churchyard, Northampton.http://www.edintone.com/independents/robert-browne/ includes photos of a memorial stone erected in 1923  After Browne  The Brownist movement revived in London from around 1587, led by Henry Barrow and John Greenwood. Both were arrested in 1587 and kept in prison until their execution in 1593. They wrote numerous books of Brownist theology and polemic in secret during their imprisonment, which were smuggled out by their followers and printed in the Netherlands, the most important being Barrow's A Brief Discoverie of the False Church. Dozens of other Brownists were imprisoned and many of them died in jail. After the execution of Barrow and Greenwood, the Brownist church was led by Francis Johnson. As a puritan minister, Johnson had been given the job of burning Brownist books, but kept one back for himself and was converted by it. To escape the fate of Barrow and Greenwood, the Brownists made an abortive attempt to settle in Newfoundland, before going into exile in Amsterdam. There the church was co-led by Henry Ainsworth and became known as the Ancient Church. Johnson and Ainsworth printed numerous works in Amsterdam which were smuggled into England. Another wave of Brownism resulted from Archbishop Richard Bancroft's campaign against puritanism from 1604. John Robinson and John Smyth founded Brownist congregations in the north of England and then led them to Amsterdam around 1608. This was the high point of the movement, with three sizeable Brownist churches, on good terms with each other, in one city. Smyth, however, broke away from Brownism to form the first Baptist church, Robinson responded by removing his church to Leiden, while Johnson and Ainsworth quarrelled with each other and formed congregations. Johnson took his faction to Virginia, but few survived the journey. Smyth's church joined the Mennonites, while a group of Baptists returned to London led by Thomas Helwys. Half of Robinson's church sailed on the Mayflower to New England. Shakespeare The Brownists are mentioned in Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, believed to have been written around 1600‚Äì02, in which Andrew Aguecheek says, \\"I had as lief be a Brownist as a politician\\" (III, ii).

Each DGPS uses a network of fixed ground-based reference stations to broadcast the difference between the positions indicated by the GPS satellite system and known fixed positions. These stations broadcast the difference between the measured satellite pseudoranges and actual (internally computed) pseudoranges, and receiver stations may correct their pseudoranges by the same amount. The digital correction signal is typically broadcast locally over ground-based transmitters of shorter range. The United States Coast Guard (USCG) and the Canadian Coast Guard (CCG) each run DGPSes in the United States and Canada on longwave radio frequencies between 285 kHz and 325 kHz near major waterways and harbors. The USCG's DGPS was named NDGPS (Nationwide DGPS) and was jointly administered by the Coast Guard and the U.S. Department of Defense's Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). It consisted of broadcast sites located throughout the inland and coastal portions of the United States including Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico. Other countries have their own DGPS. A similar system which transmits corrections from orbiting satellites instead of ground-based transmitters is called a Wide-Area DGPS (WADGPS) Kee, C., Parkinson, B. W., and Axelrad, P. (1991), \\"Wide area differential GPS\\", Navigation, Journal of the Institute of Navigation, 38, 2 (Summer, 1991), or Satellite Based Augmentation System. History When GPS was first being put into service, the US military was concerned about the possibility of enemy forces using the globally available GPS signals to guide their own weapon systems. Originally, the government thought the \\"coarse acquisition\\" (C/A) signal would give only about 100-meter accuracy, but with improved receiver designs, the actual accuracy was 20 to 30 meters. Starting in March 1990,, page 11. to avoid providing such unexpected accuracy, the C/A signal transmitted on the L1 frequency (1575.42 MHz) was deliberately degraded by offsetting its clock signal by a random amount, equivalent to about 100 meters of distance. This technique, known as \\"Selective Availability\\", or SA for short, seriously degraded the usefulness of the GPS signal for non-military users. More accurate guidance was possible for users of dual-frequency GPS receivers which also received the L2 frequency (1227.6 MHz), but the L2 transmission, intended for military use, was encrypted and was available only to authorized users with the decryption keys. This presented a problem for civilian users who relied upon ground-based radio navigation systems such as LORAN, VOR and NDB systems costing millions of dollars each year to maintain. The advent of a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) could provide greatly improved accuracy and performance at a fraction of the cost. The accuracy inherent in the S/A signal was however too poor to make this realistic. The military received multiple requests from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), United States Coast Guard (USCG) and United States Department of Transportation (DOT) to set S/A aside to enable civilian use of GNSS, but remained steadfast in its objection on grounds of security. Through the early to mid 1980s, a number of agencies developed a solution to the SA \\"problem\\". Since the SA signal was changed slowly, the effect of its offset on positioning was relatively fixed ‚Äì that is, if the offset was \\"100 meters to the east\\", that offset would be true over a relatively wide area. This suggested that broadcasting this offset to local GPS receivers could eliminate the effects of SA, resulting in measurements closer to GPS's theoretical performance, around 15 meters. Additionally, another major source of errors in a GPS fix is due to transmission delays in the ionosphere, which could also be measured and corrected for in the broadcast. This offered an improvement to about 5 meters accuracy, more than enough for most civilian needs. The US Coast Guard was one of the more aggressive proponents of the DGPS, experimenting with the system on an ever-wider basis through the late 1980s and early 1990s. These signals are broadcast on marine longwave frequencies, which could be received on existing radiotelephones and fed into suitably equipped GPS receivers. Almost all major GPS vendors offered units with DGPS inputs, not only for the USCG signals, but also aviation units on either VHF or commercial AM radio bands. They started sending out \\"production quality\\" DGPS signals on a limited basis in 1996, and rapidly expanded the network to cover most US ports of call, as well as the Saint Lawrence Seaway in partnership with the Canadian Coast Guard. Plans were put into place to expand the system across the US, but this would not be easy. The quality of the DGPS corrections generally fell with distance, and large transmitters capable of covering large areas tend to cluster near cities. This meant that lower- population areas, notably in the midwest and Alaska, would have little coverage by ground-based GPS. As of November 2013 the USCG's national DGPS consisted of 85 broadcast sites which provide dual coverage to almost the entire US coastline and inland navigable waterways including Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. In addition the system provided single or dual coverage to a majority of the inland portion of United States. Instead, the FAA (and others) started studying broadcasting the signals across the entire hemisphere from communications satellites in geostationary orbit. This led to the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) and similar systems, although these are generally not referred to as DGPS, or alternatively, \\"wide-area DGPS\\". WAAS offers accuracy similar to the USCG's ground-based DGPS networks, and there has been some argument that the latter will be turned off as WAAS becomes fully operational. By the mid-1990s it was clear that the SA system was no longer useful in its intended role. DGPS would render it ineffective over the US, where it was considered most needed. Additionally, during the Gulf War of 1990-1991 SA had been temporarily turned off because Allied troops were using commercial GPS receivers. This showed that leaving SA turned off could be useful to the United States.GPS for Dummies, stating that there weren't enough military GPS receivers, so \\"Selective Availability was temporarily turned off in 1990 during the Persian Gulf War\\" so that Coalition troops could use civilian GPS receivers. In 2000, an executive order by President Bill Clinton turned it off permanently in 2000. Nevertheless, by this point DGPS had evolved into a system for providing more accuracy than even a non-SA GPS signal could provide on its own. There are several other sources of error which share the same characteristics as SA in that they are the same over large areas and for \\"reasonable\\" amounts of time. These include the ionospheric effects mentioned earlier, as well as errors in the satellite position ephemeris data and clock drift on the satellites. Depending on the amount of data being sent in the DGPS correction signal, correcting for these effects can reduce the error significantly, the best implementations offering accuracies of under 10 cm. In addition to continued deployments of the USCG and FAA sponsored systems, a number of vendors have created commercial DGPS services, selling their signal (or receivers for it) to users who require better accuracy than the nominal 15 meters GPS offers. Almost all commercial GPS units, even hand-held units, now offer DGPS data inputs, and many also support WAAS directly. To some degree, a form of DGPS is now a natural part of most GPS operations. Operation DGPS Reference Station (choke ring antenna) A reference station calculates differential corrections for its own location and time. Users may be up to 200 nautical miles (370 km) from the station, however, and some of the compensated errors vary with space: specifically, satellite ephemeris errors and those introduced by ionospheric and tropospheric distortions. For this reason, the accuracy of DGPS decreases with distance from the reference station. The problem can be aggravated if the user and the station lack \\"inter visibility\\"‚Äîwhen they are unable to see the same satellites. Accuracy The United States Federal Radionavigation Plan and the IALA Recommendation on the Performance and Monitoring of DGNSS Services in the Band 283.5‚Äì325 kHz cite the United States Department of Transportation's 1993 estimated error growth of 0.67 m per 100 km from the broadcast site but measurements of accuracy across the Atlantic, in Portugal, suggest a degradation of just 0.22 m per 100 km.Monteiro, Lu√≠s Sardinha; Moore, Terry and Hill, Chris. 'What is the accuracy of DGPS?', The Journal of Navigation (2005) 58, 207-225. Variations DGPS can refer to any type of Ground-Based Augmentation System (GBAS). There are many operational systems in use throughout the world, according to the US Coast Guard, 47 countries operate systems similar to the US NDGPS (Nationwide Differential Global Positioning System). A list can be found at World DGPS Database for Dxers =European DGPS Network= European DGPS network has been developed mainly by the Finnish and Swedish maritime administrations in order to improve safety in the archipelago between the two countries. In the UK and Ireland, the system was implemented as a maritime navigation aid to fill the gap left by the demise of the Decca Navigator System in 2000. With a network of 12 transmitters sited around the coastline and three control stations, it was set up in 1998 by the countries' respective General Lighthouse Authorities (GLA) ‚Äî Trinity House covering England, Wales and the Channel Islands, the Northern Lighthouse Board covering Scotland and the Isle of Man and the Commissioners of Irish Lights, covering the whole of Ireland. Transmitting on the 300-kHz band, the system underwent testing and two additional transmitters were added before the system was declared operational in 2002. Trinity House - DGNSS Stations: UK and Ireland Effective Solutions (Data Products) - European Differential Beacon Transmitters - Details and map =United States NDGPS= The United States Department of Transportation, in conjunction with the Federal Highway Administration, the Federal Railroad Administration and the National Geodetic Survey appointed the Coast Guard as the maintaining agency for the U.S. Nationwide DGPS network (NDGPS). The system is an expansion of the previous Maritime Differential GPS (MDGPS), which the Coast Guard began in the late 1980s and completed in March 1999. MDGPS covered only coastal waters, the Great Lakes, and the Mississippi River inland waterways, while NDGPS expands this to include complete coverage of the continental United States. The centralized Command and Control unit is the USCG Navigation Center, based in Alexandria, VA. United States Coast Guard Navigation Center, Alexandria, VA; Standard Operating Procedures (2002) There are currently 85 NDGPS sites in the US network, administered by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Navigation Center. In 2015, the USCG and USACE sought comments on a planned phasing-out of the U.S. DGPS. In response to the comments received, a subsequent 2016 Federal Register notice announced that 46 stations would remain in service and \\"available to users in the maritime and coastal regions\\". In spite of this decision, USACE decommissioned its remaining 7 sites and, in March 2018, the USCG announced that it would decommission its remaining stations by 2020. =Canadian DGPS= The Canadian system is similar to the US system and is primarily for maritime usage covering the Atlantic and Pacific coast as well as the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence Seaway. =Australia= Australia runs three DGPSes: one is mainly for marine navigation, broadcasting its signal on the long-wave band; another is used for land surveys and land navigation, and has corrections broadcast on the Commercial FM radio band. The third at Sydney airport is currently undergoing testing for precision landing of aircraft (2011), as a backup to the Instrument Landing System at least until 2015. It is called the Ground Based Augmentation System. Corrections to aircraft position are broadcast via the aviation VHF band. The marine DGPS service of 16 Ground stations covering the Australian coast was discontinued from 1st July 2020 . Improved multichannel GPS capabilities, and signal sources from multiple providers (GPS, GLONASS, Galileo and BeiDou) was cited as providing better navigational accuracy than could be obtained from GPS + DGPS. An Australian Satellite-Based Augmentation System (SBAS) project, led by Geoscience Australia (GA), will offer higher accuracy positioning for GNSS users within the next 2 - 3 years. Post processing Post-processing is used in Differential GPS to obtain precise positions of unknown points by relating them to known points such as survey markers. The GPS measurements are usually stored in computer memory in the GPS receivers, and are subsequently transferred to a computer running the GPS post-processing software. The software computes baselines using simultaneous measurement data from two or more GPS receivers. The baselines represent a three-dimensional line drawn between the two points occupied by each pair of GPS antennas. The post-processed measurements allow more precise positioning, because most GPS errors affect each receiver nearly equally, and therefore can be cancelled out in the calculations. Differential GPS measurements can also be computed in real time by some GPS receivers if they receive a correction signal using a separate radio receiver, for example in Real Time Kinematic (RTK) surveying or navigation. The improvement of GPS positioning doesn't require simultaneous measurements of two or more receivers in any case, but can also be done by special use of a single device. In the 1990s when even handheld receivers were quite expensive, some methods of quasi-differential GPS were developed, using the receiver by quick turns of positions or loops of 3-10 survey points.

It links Rivervale and Burswood with West Perth and Leederville, providing an east-west bypass of Perth's central business district. The freeway, in conjunction with Great Eastern Highway and Orrong Road, is also an important connection between the city centre and Perth Airport. It is allocated State Route 8, and was named in honour of the Australian rules footballer, Graham \\"Polly\\" Farmer, who played between 1953 and 1971 in both the West Australian and Victorian Football Leagues. Route description Driving through the Graham Farmer Freeway tunnel eastbound in 2020 Driving through the Graham Farmer Freeway tunnel westbound in 2013 =Western terminus= The freeway's western terminus is a hybrid interchange, combining a Full Y interchange with the Mitchell Freeway, an exit to James Street, and an entrance ramp from and exit ramp to Loftus Street. The interchange also incorporates a partial Y interchange that connects Charles Street to the Mitchell Freeway. This is known as the Hamilton Interchange. =Northbridge Tunnel= Immediately east of the interchange is the Northbridge Tunnel, Western Australia's only freeway tunnel. The tunnel has three traffic lanes in each direction, with an escape passageway between the carriageways. The tunnel is colloquially known as the \\"Polly Pipe\\", a reference not only to the freeway's namesake, but also to the colloquialism \\"Poly Pipe\\" in reference to plastic pipes (commonly made from polyethylene or polyvinyl chloride materials) used in reticulation and plumbing.Hyde, John; Hansard; 2002-05-08 Both tunnel portals feature public art installations. At the western end, there is a pictorial history of Northbridge, and at the eastern end, the Aboriginal artist Ron Corbett created images based on indigenous artwork. The transportation of dangerous goods and explosives through the freeway tunnel is prohibited.Explosay Issue Number 25 (Sept 2000) (PDF) Retrieved 13 August 2006. =Perth City exits= At the eastern end of the tunnel is the diamond interchange with East Parade, which connects the freeway to East Perth. The East Parade exit ramps allow traffic movements to the opposite entrance ramp, as the westbound entrance ramp also connects to Lord Street, whilst the eastbound exit ramp merges with a ramp from Lord Street. This allows a connection between the city centre and the freeway, via Lord Street. =Windan Bridge= The freeway then crosses the Swan River over the , six lane Windan Bridge.Windan Bridge.

There is a diamond interchange with Victoria Park Drive for access to the adjacent Belmont Park Racecourse, and the nearby Optus Stadium and Crown Perth complex. The eastern terminus is a modified diamond interchange with Great Eastern Highway, that includes a looped ramp for the south-westbound to north-eastbound traffic movement. The freeway continues south-east as Orrong Road, an arterial road that is also part of State Route 8. History Graham Farmer Freeway was constructed between 1996 and 2000, and used over 180,000 cubic metres of concrete. The project finished three months early and within budget, costing $313 million. It has been designed to have a 150-year lifespan, following the Main Roads Western Australia specification. Stage 1 involved construction of the tunnel and was undertaken by a Clough/Baulderstone Hornibrook joint venture,Graham Farmer Freeway - Perth was a finalist for the 2001 Australian Construction Achievement Award.Graham Farmer Freeway Stage One Retrieved 13 August 2006.

Retrieved 13 August 2006. =2013 tunnel expansion= During several weekend closures in April 2013, the existing breakdown shoulders were removed to accommodate an extra lane of traffic in each direction, without modifying the tunnel's structure. The removal of the breakdown lanes was criticised by the state Opposition, and the RAC raised concerns about emergency response times. As part of the upgrade, Main Roads Western Australia implemented an incident response plan, including a dedicated towing service, and the fire control and ventilation systems were upgraded. The new eastbound lane opened on 16 April, a day after it was originally scheduled to open, due to delays in commissioning the new lane use management system. The third westbound lane opened on 29 April, as scheduled. The works were designed to improve the traffic flow in the Perth CBD, which was affected by construction projects such as the development of Elizabeth Quay.

First recorded as used in 19771977 Economist 2 Apr. (Survey) 22/1 The views of the loony left are well known in the democratic world., the term was widely used in the campaign for the 1987 general election and subsequently both by the Conservative Party and by British newspapers that supported the Conservatives as well as by more moderate factions within the Labour movement to refer to the activities of more militantly left-wing politicians that they believed moderate voters would perceive as extreme or unreasonable. The label was directed at the policies and actions of some Labour controlled inner-city councils and some Labour Party politicians. Although the labels hard left and soft left reflected a genuine political division within the Labour Party, loony left was by far the more often used label than either. While academics have depicted the era as of the \\"new urban left\\" (such as the rate-capping rebellion) as a throwback to earlier municipal militancy (e.g. Poplarism), wider media coverage tended to focus on the personalities of city leaders such as the Greater London Council's Ken Livingstone and Liverpool's Derek Hatton.  Origin and themes of the term  The term \\"Loony Left\\" as used to describe certain aspects of Labour politics was invented by the British popular press a few years before the 1987 general election. Throughout the run-up to the election it became a staple feature of press-coverage of the election, with many stories running detailing the \\"antics\\" of Labour politicians and Labour- controlled local government authorities. Jolyon Jenkins recorded in 1987 that 1986 was the climax of the Loony Left campaign: The ridicule of the political left by some British newspapers has a far longer history. Petley observes that the British press had long-since \\"perfected a way of representing the ideas and personalities associated with socialism as so deranged and psychotic that they represented a danger to society\\", thus rendering them fair game for editorial vilification. After his party's defeat in the 1983 general election, one newspaper had characterised Michael Foot's habit of swinging his walking stick around as he went for his morning walk as being \\"like an escaped loony\\". The election of Ken Livingstone to leader of the Greater London Council in 1981 had him regularly described in newspapers as \\"barmy\\" or \\"loony\\", with the GLC's policies labelled \\"crazy\\". These labels were increasingly also applied to local councils within London: The 13 March 1983 Sunday People labelled Islington local council the \\"Bananas republic\\"; and the 13 February 1983 Mail on Sunday labelled it \\"The mad mad mad mad world of Islington\\". In some ways, the \\"Loony Left\\" campaign was a generalisation of the Conservative campaign of demonising Livingstone and the GLC. As recorded by Jenkins, the climax of the campaign was in 1986 and pivotal moments in its history were the London local council elections held in May 1986 and the 1987 Greenwich by-election as well as of course the campaign for the 1987 general election. The general theme that the \\"Loony Left\\" label suggested was twofold and Labour Party local government authorities were perceived to be: * Irrationally obsessed with minority and fringe issues. * Paranoid about racial and sexual \\"problems\\" that were wholly imaginary on their parts, without actual substance. \\"Loony Left\\" was also used to describe specific individuals. Neil Kinnock, who had been subject to press vituperation since his election as party leader was associated with the \\"Loony Left\\" when in March 1987 he endorsed a rise of 60% in local council rates in Ealing, where he was a rate-payer. The Sun gave this the headline \\"Kinnock admits ‚Äî I back loonies\\" and other newspapers put this forward as an example of support for extremism by the Labour Party leadership. A later story in the Daily Express about how Ken Livingstone purportedly had a left-wing takeover of the party arranged was denied by the Labour leadership only to have that reported as \\"Neil Denies Truth About Left Plot\\". Similarly, Deirdrie Wood, Labour candidate in the 1987 Greenwich by-election, came to be known in the press as \\"Dreadful Deirdrie\\". Wood had been selected by her local constituency party against opposition from the Labour leadership. Privately, she had promised Kinnock \\"I won't drop you in it\\", to which he had replied \\"It's not you, it's those bastards out there\\", i.e. the press. Labour presented her as \\"a hard-working local woman with sensible policies\\", but the press portrayed her as a radical extremist both by association, as an IRA sympathiser living with a militant shop steward who was not the father of her children and directly as a \\"hard left feminist, anti-racist and gay-rights supporter\\" (as one News of the World report put it) who wanted to twin London schools with PLO camps. However, local authorities were the primary targets, in part because that is where progressives had found their platform in the 1980s. This was caused by two factors: a change in the composition of local authorities and the general election defeats for Labour from 1979 onwards. Partly because of structural changes to local authorities enacted in 1974, including the end of local aldermanic dignities and partly simply as a result of an influx of new people whose background had been in the radical youth movements of the 1960s, local government authorities became highly partisan political battlegrounds in the 1970s and 1980s that a canny politician would be able to use to construct a power base and as a stepping stone to a career in national-level politics. This was compounded by the general election defeats for Labour, leaving the party with little ability to push its agenda at a national level in Westminster. As a result, local authorities became hotbeds of progressive and radical ideas and a conflict between local Labour local authorities and the Conservative central government on many issues ensued. Like municipal socialism before it, Labour leaderships at local level saw themselves as stronger than their Westminster party colleagues and capable of pushing socialist political agendas where they could not be pushed at national level. This resulted in an era of \\"grand gesture politics\\", with local authorities taking highly visible stances on national political issues such as declaring themselves nuclear-free zones and \\"rainbow coalitions\\" between local Labour party politicians and pressure groups for causes outside of Labour's traditional working-class roots, such as anti-racism, gay rights, disabled rights and feminist groups. Unfortunately for Labour, the wide range of local-level policy initiatives that this engendered made it easy for Conservative opponents to then apply the \\"Loony Left\\" blanket label that the news media had handed to them, a political card that the Conservatives played at both local and national levels. The label was a particularly effective tactic against Labour-controlled local education authorities because the suggestion of innocent children being manipulated to further cynical adult political goals was a very potent image.  Persistence of the idea and counteraction by the Labour Party  The label still occurs in British political discourse, even in the 21st century and has become a firmly embedded feature of British journalism. However, changes made by the Labour Party after the 1987 general election to ensure that it was no longer associated in the public mind with the images of the \\"Loony Left\\" from 1986‚Äì1987 have since blunted its impact and reduced its power, to the extent that it had far less impact on the 1992 United Kingdom general election, less even (according to academic studies by Butler and Kavanaugh) than Labour Party officials themselves believed at the time post-election. These changes were in part an increased awareness of how important news media were to Labour's election campaign. One party press secretary said of Labour's attitude to the news media in the 1983 general election campaign: \\"If a miracle had happened and Fleet Street had suddenly come clamouring to Walworth Road for pro-Labour material, they would have been sent away with a copy of the manifesto each\\". The party leadership noted afterwards that it had been the effect of the \\"Loony Left\\" image that had caused it to lose the 1987 Greenwich by-election by such a large margin. This is not to say that Labour ignored the press, but it became reluctant to talk to it. Kinnock refused to talk to the press on the flight back from his visit to the U.S. President Ronald Reagan after British journalists had continually sought a story that would represent the trip in a negative light. Similarly, Patricia Hewitt, then party press secretary, considered abandoning holding daily press conferences in the run-up to the 1987 general election because \\"they allow the newspaper journalists to set the agenda ‚Ä¶ and we know where they stand\\". In a widely leaked letter written to Frank Dobson after the Greenwich by-election and published by the Sun under the headline \\"Gays put Kinnock in a panic -- secret letter lashes loonies\\", Hewitt said: Nick Raynsford similarly ascribed the general election defeat to the \\"Loony Left\\" and other factors stating after the election that there were \\"too many worrying skeletons in the Labour Party cupboard deterring voters\\". In general, the \\"soft left\\" portion of the Labour Party blamed the \\"Loony Left\\" perception for this third general election defeat, despite the election campaign having been, in Larry Whitty's words, \\"the most effective campaign the party has ever waged\\". According to the \\"soft left\\", the Labour-controlled local government authorities had made errors in both pace and presentation, albeit that almost any initiative relating to race or sex, no matter how presented or paced, would have been seized by the press and held up for vilification. Even before the election, Labour was working hard to distance itself from the \\"Loony Left\\" perception. Roy Hattersley stated that at the time of the initiative of Brent Council to appoint race-relations advisers to schools \\"I do not deny the existence of unacceptable behaviour in some local education authorities. I want to eliminate it\\". Similarly, a question-and- answer pamphlet for voters prepared by staff at Labour headquarters had the question: \\"But if I vote Labour won't I get a loony left council like those in London?\\", to which the answer given was: \\"Left councils are exceptions, Neil Kinnock has told them to mend their ways and he is in full charge of the Labour Party\\". On several occasions, the Labour Party leadership and others attempted to take a hard line on the \\"Loony Left\\" in order to gain a more favourable impression in the media. On 3 April 1987, for example, five Labour MPs with constituencies in Birmingham -- Roy Hattersley, Denis Howell, Jeff Rooker, Terry Davis and Robin Corbett -- wrote to Sharon Atkin, Bernie Grant and Linda Bellos in letters that they themselves leaked to the newspapers, demanding that they not attend a meeting in Birmingham, scheduled for 7 April, of activists campaigning for Black Sections within the Labour Party. Similarly, after the Greenwich by-election defeat five London Labour Party members -- Brian Nicholson, Roger Godsiff, John Spellar, Roy Shaw and Dianne Hayter -- formed the \\"Londoners for Labour\\" association, according to their press releases aimed at reclaiming the London Labour Party from \\"the loonies\\". The 1980s UK press campaign against the \\"Loony Left\\" was echoed in the 1990s in the U.S. where sections of the press campaigned against political correctness, using much the same rhetoric. The same accusations made by the British press in the 1980s were levelled by U.S. newspapers such as The Chicago Tribune, The New Republic, Time, Newsweek and New York.  Exemplification  As Jenkins noted, the truth of the stories mattered less than their resonance with voter fears. Three of the most famously recorded instances of \\"Loony Left\\" activities - the renaming of the nursery rhyme Baa Baa Black Sheep, of \\"manhole covers\\" and of \\"black bin-liner bags\\" - were myths, outright fabrications by the press. Others stories, such as reports that London councils had insisted that homosexuals be placed at the heads of the waiting lists for council housing and that London councils had spent ¬£500,000 on \\"24 super-loos for gypsies\\" were found to be highly misleading upon investigation by the Media Research Group of Goldsmiths' College, University of London. The report of the MRG investigation estimated that some 3,000 news stories about the \\"Loony Left\\" ran between 1981 and 1987 in the British tabloid press alone. It determined that a large proportion of these stories were either partially or wholly fabricated and that their targets, against whom they aimed to inflame public opinion, were a small number of London local councils that were under Labour Party control. = \\"Baa Baa White Sheep\\" = In 1986, a parent-run nursery school banned the song \\"Baa Baa Black Sheep\\" over concerns the song might have racial undertones. Over time, media reports came to misreport the story, eventually incorrectly claiming the Birmingham City Council had ordered the lyrics be changed to \\"Baa Baa green sheep\\". Variants of this story have been reported repeatedly by the British mass media since 1986, to the state at which it has almost gained the status as an urban myth. Both The Age and The Herald reported in 2002, for example, the same \\"Baa Baa White Sheep\\" story, ascribing it to a parent of a child attending Paston Ridings Primary School in London. The original story reported a ban at Beevers Nursery, a privately run nursery school in Hackney. It was originally reported by Bill Akass, then a journalist at the Daily Star in the 15 February 1986 edition under the headline \\"Now it's Baa Baa Blank Sheep\\". Akass had heard of a ban issued, by nursery school staff, on the singing of the nursery rhyme \\"Baa, Baa, Black Sheep\\" on the grounds that it was racist. In his story, he wrote: The nursery was run by the parents, rather than by Hackney council, but Akass had telephoned Hackney council for its reaction to his story. Martin Bostock, then the press officer for Hackney council, reported that he had considered the possibility of simply responding: \\"We don't know what this nursery is doing, but whatever they're doing it is up to them\\". However, according to Bostock council leader Tony Millwood, Bostock rejected this advice and wanted to take a more supportive stance on the alleged ban and in conjunction with the press office drafted and issued a statement saying \\"that we supported what they'd done, although making it quite clear that it was not a council nursery and not a council ban\\". Three days later in the 18 February 1986 Hackney Gazette, Tim Cooper took up Akass's story. He went to Beevers Nursery and asked parents there what their reactions were in turn to the Hackney council statement itself a reaction to the claim that Beevers had issued a ban. Cooper's story reported one of the nursery playleaders as saying: \\"We're run by parents and if they want us to stop singing it, we would. But there have been no complaints so far, though someone once suggested it could be racist\\". Cooper later stated that there had been no such ban, but that the statement issued by Millwood and Hackney council had given the story the impetus that it was then to run with: In fact, the playgroup leaders had requested the racialism awareness course, at which attendance was not compulsory, there had been no ban imposed by Haringey council and there was no evidence that the rhyme had even been discussed on the course. As before, only newspapers for the British black community reported these facts. The attempts by the Daily Mail attempts to fact check the story that it had run, including posing as parents looking for playgroups and as supermarket managers wanting to run racialism awareness courses, had failed to elicit a single playgroup worker who would confirm the alleged council ban. Haringey council initiated legal action against the Daily Mail, but was forced to drop it for lack of funds. The Daily Mail ran the story again on 20 October, comparing Haringey council to Nazi Germany. Again, the council attempted to set the record straight with a press statement that noted the irony of the Daily Mail comparing the council to Nazi Germany when the Mail itself had supported Hitler right up until the eve of World War II. Again, only the British black community newspapers (the 3 November Asian Herald and the 5 November West Indian News) carried Haringey council's corrections. The story continued to be carried by many newspapers for months thereafter, including The Economist on 1 November and the Islington Gazette on 20 February 1987, this time with Islington council as the ban-issuer, a fact that was explicitly denied by a council spokesman in the piece, who said that \\"it is not council policy to ban Baa Baa Black Sheep but if individual nursery workers find it offensive the council is not in the business of forcing them to teach that rhyme rather than others\\". Even other political parties ran with the story. A party election broadcast for the Social Democratic Party, fronted by John Cleese, named Islington council as \\"the council that accused a five year old of reciting a racially offensive poem\\". Islington council sought an injunction in the High Court to have this material excluded, but this was denied by Mr Justice Drake. David Owen dropped the material anyway, stating that it was to avoid further distress to the five-year-old's family. Ironically, the press reported Owen's press conference, announcing this change as \\"loony\\" David Owen \\"outclowning anything that Basil Fawlty could have thought up\\". In 2000, the BBC reported the withdrawal of guidance to nursery schools by Birmingham City Council that the nursery rhyme Baa Baa Black Sheep should not be taught. = Peter Jenkins = Peter Jenkins, a columnist for The Guardian and The Independent, recorded policies which were dubbed \\"loony left\\" by the media. For instance, Haringey council allowed only Nicaraguan coffee to be sold and introduced courses on homosexuality into its nursery and primary schools. Hackney London Borough Council ended its twinning arrangements with France, West Germany and Israel and made new twinnings with the Soviet Union, East Germany and Nicaragua. A spokesperson for the council explained: \\"This will enable us to concentrate on our new friends\\". When Sinn F√©in representatives were invited to speak to Hackney council, a revolver was fired by a Liberal and there was a fight in the council chamber. Lambeth London Borough Council banned the word \\"family\\" from council literature because this was \\"discriminatory\\" and police were banned from using council facilities. Lambeth council's leader, Linda Bellos, claimed: \\"I think the police are bent on war\\". Ealing council removed all books it considered to be \\"racist\\" and \\"sexist\\" from its local libraries. An Inner London Education Authority (ILEA) teaching pack titled Auschwitz: Yesterday's Racism drew comparisons between the trade union legislation of Adolf Hitler and Margaret Thatcher. Another ILEA school in Kennington discouraged competitive games and making pupils write protest letters was made part of the school time-table.

He selected the season of Lent for his attacks, when the defenders were weakened by their fasts. He was eventually slain in battle during his final offensive, targeting the Amhara, Shewa, and Fatagar provinces south of the Awash River. Sources differ over the number of years Mahfuz raided Abyssinia. Francisco √Ålvares states that his raids began during the reign of Eskender, and lasted 25 years.Alvarez, Francisco (1961) The Prester John of the Indies, translated by C.F. Beckingham and G.W.B. Huntingford. Cambridge: Hakluyt Society, p. 412. However, Beckingham and Huntingford note that the Ethiopian Paris Chronicle, which draws on contemporary Ethiopian records, dates the beginning of these raids to the ascension of Dawit II (Lebna Dengel) in 1508.Their discussion of Mahfuz is taken from their Introduction to Alvarez, Prester John, pp. 16f. Mahfuz reportedly caused the death of Ethiopian Emperors Na'od and Eskender. Upon reaching majority, Emperor Lebna Dengel decided to forgo his observance of Lent and oppose the Imam in battle, despite the advice and wishes of his councilors and people. He sent spies out to determine Imam Mahfuz's plans for that year, and learning the Imam was in Fatagar led his army there. He found Imam Mahfuz with the sultan of Adal encamped on a plain that was surrounded by mountains. After first sending soldiers out to secure the passes, the Abyssinian Emperor closed upon Imam Mahfuz. Although Imam Mahfuz managed to enable Sultan Muhammed to escape with but four horsemen, according to Alvarez, Imam Mafhuz knew he was trapped and sought to die with honor. He called to the Abyssinians a challenge to fight in single combat, and Gabra Endreyas, who had been a follower of Emperor Lebna Dengel's father, accepted and killed the Imam. Mahfuz's head was cut from his body and displayed publicly in the Emperor's court.Alvarez, p. 413. After defeating Mahfuz, Dawit II used appellation Wanag Segad, which is a combination of Ge'ez and Harari terms. Legacy Mahfuz' daughter, Bati del Wambara, married Imam Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi of the Adal Sultanate. Ten years after Mahfuz's death, Al-Ghazi embarked on a Conquest of Abyssinia (Futuh al-Habash).Sihab ad-Din Ahmad, in his Futuh al-Habasa (translated by Paul Lester Stenhouse with annotations by Richard Pankhurst [Hollywood: Tsehai, 2003]) consistently uses the word \\"Jihad\\" to refer to Ahmad Gragn's conquest of Ethiopia.

The statement (often repeated) occurs most famously in Horace's \\"Ars Poetica\\", near the end, immediately after another famous quotation, \\"\\", or \\"even Homer nods\\" (an indication that even the most skilled poet can compose inferior verse): Horace meant that poetry (in its widest sense, \\"imaginative texts\\") merited the same careful interpretation that was, in Horace's day, reserved for painting. Some centuries before, Simonides of Keos (c. 556 ‚Äì 468 BC) had stated, \\",\\" which translates into, \\"Poetry is a speaking picture, painting a silent poetry.\\" Yet, as this phrase has traversed history, it has ignited academic arguments over whether or not it is true. Plato, through his own thought process on credible knowledge, found painting and writing to be unreliable sources of understanding, disregarding the concept entirely. The lack of credibility rested on his opinion that both forms of art gave a false simulation of reality. Moving on from Plato's time to the Renaissance, the argument sprung up over which form was superior. It was decided, at this time, that painting took precedence because sight was higher-ranking to people than hearing was. Gotthold Ephraim Lessing opens his Laoco√∂n: An Essay on the Limits of Painting and Poetry (1766) by observing that \\"the first who compared painting with poetry [Simonides of Ceos] was a man of fine feeling,\\"Simonides, who wrote \\"poema pictura locguens, pictura poema silens\\" (poetry is a speaking picture, painting a silent [mute] poetry) was quoted by Plutarch, De gloria Atheniensium 3.346f. though, Lessing makes it clear, not a critic or philosopher. Lessing argues that painting is a synchronic, visual phenomenon, one of space that is immediately in its entirety understood and appreciated, while poetry (again, in its widest sense) is a diachronic art of the ear, one that depends on time to unfold itself for the reader's appreciation. He recommends that poetry and painting should not be confused, and that they are best practiced and appreciated \\"as two equitable and friendly neighbors.\\" W. J. T. Mitchell trenchantly observed that \\"We tend to think that to compare poetry with painting is to make a metaphor, while to differentiate poetry from painting is to state a literal truth.\\"Iconology: Image, Text, Ideology (University of Chicago Press, 1986) page 49 The paragone was another long- running debate, typically rather more competitive, comparing painting and sculpture.  Alexander Pope  18th-century British poet Alexander Pope was partial to ut pictura poesis. He considered both painting and poetry to be equals, and \\"it can easily be seen that he held that there was a close relationship between the art of poetry and the art of painting, especially perhaps since such a relationship combined the two arts of which he was a practitioner.\\" There is note of Pope finding himself \\"in a larger context of a continuous line of poetic pictorialism\\". Ut pictura poesis surfaces in regards to Pope's \\"Rape of the Lock\\" through his in-depth descriptions of the characters and plot. Rebecca Ferguson, in her essay \\"'Quick as her Eyes, and as unfix'd as those': objectification and seeing in Pope's 'Rape of the Lock'\\", draws attention to these details, specifically with Belinda‚Äôs character. Ferguson explains an aspect of how Pope was painting a character and a plot: \\"Pope's construction of Belinda seems to render her just such a 'frontier' between a constructive and a destructive chaos, between qualities which are 'neither inside nor outside', neither invested in her 'essential' self nor in her body,\\" and > The belle is identified in many ways with the display of vessels and > treasures around her, both as a consumer and as a figure who takes on some > of the properties of those riches, yet her attractions are in the end not so > much displayed as set in motion; she 'rises in her charms', 'awakens' and > 'calls forth' her wonders and graces, culminating in the dispersal of both > her body and her allure in the reader's eye. There is an emphasis on the reader's eye and the imagery that contributed to audience members being able to so vividly 'watch' the plot of this poem unfold.

Oxford University press. . or blood (strangling) from passing through the neck of an opponent. The restriction may be of one or both and depends on the hold used and the reaction of the victim. The lack of blood or air often leads to unconsciousness or even death if the hold is maintained. Chokeholds are used in martial arts, combat sports, self-defense, law enforcement and in military hand to hand combat applications. They are considered superior to brute-force manual strangling, which generally requires a large disparity in physical strength to be effective.Jones, Richard. Asphyxia , Strangulation . www.forensicmed.co.uk. URL last accessed February 26, 2006. Rather than using the fingers or arms to attempt to crush the neck, chokeholds effectively use leverage such as figure-four holds or collar holds that use the clothes to assist in the constriction. The terminology used varies; in most martial arts, the term \\"chokehold\\" or \\"choke\\" is used for all types of grappling holds that strangle. This can be misleading as most holds aim to strangle not choke with the exception of \\"air chokes\\" (choking means \\"to have severe difficulty in breathing because of a constricted or obstructed throat or a lack of air\\"). In Judo terminology, \\"blood chokes\\" are referred to as \\"strangleholds\\" or \\"strangles\\" while \\"air chokes\\" are called \\"chokeholds\\" or \\"chokes\\". In forensics, the terms \\"strangle\\" and \\"stranglehold\\" designate any type of neck compression, while in law-enforcement they are referred to as \\"neck holds\\".Reay, Donald; Eisele, John. Death from law enforcement neck holds. www.charlydmiller.com.URL last accessed March 3, 2006 Air choke An air choke (or tracheal choke) specifically refers to a \\"true\\" choke that compresses the upper airway (trachea, larynx or laryngopharynx), hence interfering with breathing and leading to asphyxia. Although less effective at inducing unconsciousness than its vascular counterpart, the air choke causes excruciating pain and air hunger, and in combat sports a fighter will usually submit to such a submission hold. Air chokes have been associated with fractures of the larynx or hyoid bone, and are considered less safe than blood chokes to practice. Blood choke Blood chokes (or carotid restraints / sleeper holds) are a form of strangulation that compress one or both carotid arteries and/or the jugular veins without compressing the airway, hence causing cerebral ischemia and a temporary hypoxic condition in the brain. A well applied blood choke may lead to unconsciousness in 10‚Äì20 seconds. Injury or death is plausible if the arteries remain constricted for more than 20 seconds. Compared to strangulation with the hands, properly applied blood chokes require little physical strength.Koiwai, Karl. How Safe is Choking in Judo?. judoinfo.com. URL last accessed March 3, 2006. Use in combat sports Most chokeholds featured in combat sports and martial arts are blood chokes, although some air chokes or combinations occur as well. Blood chokes, especially the rear naked choke, triangle chokes, or gi chokes, are commonly used as submission holds in Brazilian jiu-jitsu. In judo, chokeholds, known as shime-waza, are often subject to restrictions based on age or rank. Chokeholds are not allowed in sport sambo but are allowed in combat sambo. The chokeholds used in catch wrestling and shoot wrestling are the inspiration for the \\"chokeholds\\" in modern professional wrestling performances. Due to the effectiveness of chokeholds and their popularity in a wide variety of martial arts, they are most often used to force submissions in mixed martial art and submission grappling competitions. Use in law enforcement (lateral vascular neck restraint) In law enforcement the goal is to force an uncooperative subject to submit without causing death or permanent injury. In this situation it is vital to distinguish between air and blood chokes. A hold that simultaneously blocks both the left and right carotid arteries results in cerebral ischemia and loss of consciousness within seconds. If properly applied, the hold produces almost immediate cessation of resistance. However to avoid injury the hold cannot be maintained more than a few seconds. When pressure on the carotids is released, the flow of oxygenated blood resumes immediately and consciousness slowly returns. In contrast, if the airway rather than the carotid arteries is blocked, the subject cannot breathe, but his brain is still perfused with blood and he will remain conscious and may continue to struggle for a minute or more; he will lose consciousness only when the oxygen in the circulating blood is consumed and he collapses from hypoxia. Even if the hold is released at this point, the blood circulating through the brain contains no oxygen, and consequently the subject may not regain consciousness or resume spontaneous breathing. Possibly the most important element of training for the use of chokeholds in law enforcement is the understanding that the subject should always be able to breathe freely. The operator uses his right arm to compress both sides of the subject's neck, assisted by the pressure of his left hand, while his elbow, sharply flexed and centered over the midline, places no pressure on the trachea. Following a series of choking deaths, the Los Angeles Police Department banned chokeholds in 1980, and was soon followed by police departments nationwide. Choking suspects was widely banned by American police departments by the early 1990s, when New York City strengthened the force of an earlier ban on chokeholds. (It is also forensically known as a \\"carotid sleeper\\".)  Types  * Anaconda choke - Choke starting with attacker facing the opponent on all fours. Attacker passes his leading arm under the neck, and outside past one of the opponent's arms while then grabbing his own other arm's free arm biceps (resulting in similar arm positioning to a rear naked choke). The attacker then arches his back, bending backward to apply the choke. * Arm triangle choke - Choke starting with the attacker facing the opponent. The attacker passes the arm over the opponents same-side shoulder and across the back to the other shoulder. The attacker then positions the opponents arm across their neck and traps it using their head and applies pressure. May be performed from the top, or the bottom. * D'arce choke - the D'Arce choke, also known as the Brabo choke, is similar to the anaconda choke, the main divergence being the choking arm is threaded under the near arm, in front of the opponent's neck, and on top of the far arm. * Ezekiel choke or Sode guruma jime - Attacker grabs inside their own sleeve around opponent's neck. * Gogoplata - Performed from full guard by using an omoplata setup to trap the top man's arm, then pulling the bottom man's foot past the top man's head, pressing the shin of that leg against the throat. The bottom man then pulls on his opponent's head, cutting off the airflow and forcing him to submit or risk passing out from lack of oxygen. * Guillotine - Applied in front of and above the opponent, the attacker restricts air flow by lifting the forearm into the neck. A common finishing hold in mixed martial arts. * North‚Äìsouth choke - Applied from the north-south position with opponent facing up. Uses the shoulder and biceps to cut off air flow. * Rear naked choke - Applied from behind the opponent, starting by looping one arm around the neck so that the crook of the elbow is under the opponents chin, then placing the hand of that arm on the opposite biceps. The other hand is then placed on the back of the opponent's head and pushes the opponent's head and neck forward into the crook of the flexed arm. Additional pressure may be applied by pinioning the opponent's lower body by locking the legs around the opponent's waist (referred to as \\"hooks\\") and arching the back to place more force against the neck. A simple and effective chokehold, it is the most common finishing hold in mixed martial arts competition.Sherdog.com. Top 20 most common fight endings www.sherdog.com. URL last accessed February 5, 2006. * Triangle choke - Applied from full guard or from mount, the opponent's neck is trapped in a triangle formed by their own arm and the attacker's thigh and calf. A common finishing hold in mixed martial arts. * Peruvian necktie - the arms of the person applying the choke are laced around the neck with the opponent's bottom arm straight through the hold, the person applying then turns the opponent around, and drapes his legs over the back, applying the pressure to the choke. * Short wrist choke - In Judo, the rear naked choke is known as Hadaka-jime (Ë£∏Áµû„ÇÅ): \\"rear naked choke\\", one of the 36 constriction techniques of Kodokan judo in the shime-waza list. It digs the blade of the wrist into the carotid sinus similar to the hand clasp method and uses a lever motion helped by the underhand. It is faster to apply requiring less strength than the figure four/mixed-martial arts version but is more difficult to learn. It is not an air choke but a carotid choke created entirely by the attacker's arms. * Von Flue choke - this choke is mostly used in MMA, and some rare instances in wrestling, because of the rarity of its use, it is often overlooked in its effectiveness. The choke is applied with the opponent in a supine position, with his back against the mat, the person applying then laces his closest arm around the back of the head, and places his entire body weight against the neck, causing both air constriction, and restriction of blood flow to the brain, prolonged applying of this hold can result in loss of consciousness, either due to loss of blood flow to the brain, or loss of air to the lungs, if kept applied for too long, it can result in death to the opponent.

The Committee was created as an advisory body by Resolution XVII of the Third Meeting of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the American Republics, held at Rio de Janeiro in January 1942. The Resolution provided that the Governing Board of the Pan American Union (PAU) consult the Governments of the American Republics, determine the functions of the Committee, prepare the regulations for governing its activities, and fix its budget of expenditures. The report of the Special Committee of the Governing Board of the PAU was approved by the Board at its session on February 25, 1942, and was sent to the 21 Governments with the proposed regulations. The Governing Board gave approval of these two documents on April 6, 1942, and named the Governments of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, United States, Mexico, Uruguay, and Venezuela to be members of the Committee who would represent the 21 nations. Carl B. Spaeth and William Sanders were successively members from the United States. In each country a liaison officer was named to serve the members of the Committee headquartered in Montevideo.

It is the opening track of their second album, Rated R, and the second single to be released from it. The song also accompanied the UK release of the album on a separate CD entitled Rated U. Upon the album's release, \\"Feel Good Hit of the Summer\\" had particular attention drawn to it due to the song's focus on drugs. Despite this, critical reception to the song was generally positive, with various critics considering it a highlight of the album. Background and writing Josh Homme claimed the song was conceived after his three-day Millennium party. The song's lyrics are merely a list of drugs repeated throughout. The drugs listed in the verses are nicotine, Valium, Vicodin, marijuana, ecstasy and alcohol, with cocaine mentioned throughout the chorus. Homme has hinted that the song is a direct reference to the band's stoner rock label: > [\\"Feel Good Hit of the Summer\\"] might be like a knife in the neck of stoner > rock. It's hard to tell, and I think that's the good part about it. Look, > you're always going to get labeled with something. Stoner rock is kind of a > dumbing-down label, and that's why I don't gravitate toward it. On multiple occasions, Homme has also referred to the song as a \\"social experiment\\" in regards to how the public would approach it. He has also stated that despite the heavy drugs content in the track, the band's stance was left ambiguous, stating that \\"there's no endorsement\\" and that \\"[the song] doesn't say yes or no\\". Chris Goss, who co-produced Rated R with Homme under the pseudonym The 5:15ers, later stated that the track was intended to be a \\"joke\\" and a \\"funny song\\". He also commented that it was originally recorded as a chant at the end of the album, but its effectiveness resulted in its expansion into a full song and usage as the opener. Though it was Josh Homme who provided lead vocals, there are several other vocalists present on the track. Judas Priest lead singer Rob Halford was in a neighbouring studio when this song was first recorded and ended up singing backing vocals at the band's request, calling the lyrics a \\"rock and roll cocktail\\". Halford's performance was only used in the final chorus of the track, though this was enough to have him credited alongside Nick Oliveri, Wendy Ray Moan and Nick Eldorado as providing backing vocals. The song features again on Rated R as a reprise after the eighth track \\"In the Fade\\". Reception Due to the frequency and blatant nature of the drug references in \\"Feel Good Hit of the Summer\\", a number of radio stations refused to play it. Wal-Mart initially refused to sell Rated R unless the song was removed from the album or a warning label placed upon it, though the band successfully argued that the cover and name of the album were warnings in themselves. Critically, the song fared well and was chosen as a highlight of Rated R by The Guardian, Robert Christgau, and numerous others. In reference to the song, NME said in their review of the album that \\"Among modern American rock moments, it stands alongside \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" or RATM's \\"Killing in the Name\\", such is its irresistible, instant impact\\", also labelling it an \\"anthem\\". Rolling Stone similarly likened the track to \\"unreleased Nirvana\\". Steve Huey of Allmusic wasn't so taken with the song, branding it \\"tiresome\\" and chastising its usage for a reprisal. \\"Feel Good Hit of the Summer\\" was featured in a number of prominent end-of-year lists for best song, including Robert Christgau's Pazz & Jop critics poll which placed the song at number 26. It also reached number six on NME's list, two places below fellow Rated R single \\"The Lost Art of Keeping a Secret\\". The song was also included on the CD release of the Triple J Hottest 100 for 2000, despite not featuring on the actual list. In October 2011, NME placed it at number 82 on its list \\"150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years\\". Legacy The band reprise the track on their follow-up to Rated R, Songs for the Deaf, following the song \\"A Song for the Deaf\\". Though the music sounds similar, the lyrics are replaced by rhythmic laughing (it was entitled Feel Good Hit of Haha). Queens of the Stone Age have frequently performed \\"Feel Good Hit of the Summer\\" live since the release of Rated R and whilst touring subsequent albums. On the band's tour for their 2007 album Era Vulgaris, the song was extended with numerous jams and new segments frequently taking it past the six-minute mark. It was on this tour that the band used the track as the opener for what was intended to be a six-song gig at an undisclosed Los Angeles rehab clinic. Due to the song's lyrics, the set was cut short and the band were escorted from the premises by security. \\"Feel Good Hit of the Summer\\" is used in videos by the Colorado Police Department to demonstrate the dangers of drunk driving, one of two Queens of the Stone Age tracks to be used in such a way (the other being \\"Better Living Through Chemistry\\" which is used in a similar way by the San Diego County Sheriff's Department). \\"Feel Good Hit of the Summer\\" was used in the 2000 film Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2, with the track also being included on its soundtrack release. Alternative rock band Yourcodenameis:milo performed a version of the track on the cover album Higher Voltage, given away free with issue 1164 of Kerrang! magazine. The song has also been covered live by Placebo, Foo Fighters and Machine Head. Rap duo Atmosphere entitled a drug themed song off their 2009 EP Leak at Will, \\"Feel Good Hit of the Summer Part 2\\" in reference to this track. Atmosphere member Slug had previously stated his appreciation of Queens of the Stone Age. Artwork and music video The music video The single's cover art features the title spelled out with various drugs, many of which are mentioned within the song. The song also heavily influenced the choices made for the title, cover and accompanying booklet of Rated R. Themes included drugs and censorship, with the MPAA's rating system targeted specifically. Continuing as such, the album's liner notes contain several worded warnings for each song, akin to parents' guides most commonly seen on the covers for DVDs. Those listed for \\"Feel Good Hit of the Summer\\" include 'Adult Situations, 'Consumption' and 'Illegal Substances', referencing the drug-related content of the song. All of this would seem portentous considering the controversy the track subsequently caused. The video also puts significant focus on the subject of the song. Created as an animation, it has a loose plot following a man driving under what appears to be the influence of some form of hallucinogenic drug. This is demonstrated by colour becoming more varied and vibrant in the song's chorus, with numerous literal representations of drugs featured throughout. The band are also shown performing the song through the technique of rotoscoping, which they would again use in the video for their 2003 single \\"Go With the Flow\\". The video culminates in the man's vehicle driving off into the distance and exploding into a mushroom cloud upon reaching the horizon.

Early life Pendderwen was born in Berkeley, California, on May 21, 1946. Career Pendderwen became a student and \\"craft-son\\" to Victor Anderson and Cora Anderson, learned the Feri Tradition of witchcraft from them, and helped popularize it in the Neopagan community. In addition to being credited with naming the tradition (originally spelled \\"Faerie\\"), he wrote many poems and liturgical materials for the tradition, as well as initiating many others into the tradition. His \\"descendants\\" have come to be known as the Watchmaker line of Feri. He was a co-founder of two other organizations with Alison Harlow. One was \\"Nemeton\\", a Neopagan networking group. Nemeton quickly spread opening regional offices all across the United States, forming a huge networking organization that played an important key role in the early growth of Pagan and Wiccan networking in America. In 1977 Oberon Zell, Morning Glory and Alison Harlow co-founded the \\"Holy Order of Mother Earth\\" (HOME) as a monastic sanctuary dedicated to nature. Other pagans soon began to arrive and join them, amongst them: Anodea Judith, Eldri Littlewolf and Anna Korn. They formed a pagan-based magical working group representing many differing traditions, including: Feri, Dianic, British Traditional, the New and Reformed Druids of North America (NRDNA), Celtic/Shamanic Wicca, Church of All Worlds (CAW), Strega and elements of ceremonial magic. Later in 1978 Nemeton merged with the Church of All Worlds and became its publishing arm. The other was \\"Forever Forests\\", an ecological mission dedicated to healing the planet through reforestation and other methods of addressing ecological issues. They held annual tree planting festivals on the land at Annwfn; since then tens of thousands of trees such as Cedar, Pine, Douglas Fir and Redwood have been planted all over Northern California. After being recognized for his music at a celebration in Wales in 1976, Pendderwen returned to California, quit his job with the Internal Revenue Service, and purchased a plot of the Greenfield Ranch in Mendocino County. Naming his parcel Annwfn after the Welsh underworld, he later gift-deeded the property to the Church of All Worlds with which he had long been involved. Death Gwydion Pendderwen died in an automobile accident on November 6, 1982. Music Pendderwen released his first album, Songs for the Old Religion, in 1975, followed by a book of his music and lyrics titled Wheel of the Year in 1979. His second album, The F√§erie Shaman, was released in 1982. Both albums and the songbook were well received by the Pagan community; the songbook included many songs which became classics within the community, and the two albums were collected as a two-CD set titled The Music of Gwydion and published by Serpentine Music. Pendderwen also served for a time as a court bard to the West Kingdom of the Society for Creative Anachronism.

It consists of over 13,000 kilometers of trenched fibre optic lines and wireless links, serving 429 communities. It is intended to link Alberta's public institutions, as well as rural communities and First Nations in the province. SuperNet was constructed as a public-private partnership between the government of Alberta, Bell West, and Axia NetMedia (who was contracted to sell wholesale access to the network). The network, which began construction in 2001, consists of two components: a \\"base area\\" network which serves 27 urban communities, and an \\"extended area\\" network which connects rural and First Nations areas to the SuperNet. The network provides layer 3 connectivity. Parts of the network, especially in Northern Alberta, utilize wireless links instead of fibre. Linking Fort Chipewyan was especially difficult, due to its terrain and the protected Wood Buffalo National Park‚Äînecessitating a 120 km wireless link from the Birch Mountains. On June 29, 2018, Service Alberta announced that it had declined to renew its contract with Axia NetMedia, and that it had reached a multi-year deal with Bell Canada to assume operations of SuperNet. Bell Canada subsequently announced the following Monday that it had also agreed to acquire Axia SuperNet Ltd., the local Axia subsidiary. Reception Since Alberta SuperNet was not intended to serve as a last mile network, its success in bridging the rural-urban digital divide depends on private ISPs to connect rural homes and businesses to SuperNet. In many rural communities these services have been slow to develop due to the lack of a clear business case or economic incentive, resulting in criticism of this aspect of the SuperNet model. In 2005 The Association of Canadian Engineering Companies gave the Award of Excellence to Morrison Hershfield for project management of the Alberta SuperNet.

That year, the PLC endorsed for Librarian of Congress Archibald MacLeish, chairman in 1937 of the first open meeting of the Second Congress of the League of American Writers, which was \\"founded under Communist auspices in 1935,\\" according to a 1942 report by President Roosevelt's Attorney General Francis Biddle.During the Nazi-Soviet pact, said Biddle, the League \\"began openly to follow the Communist Party line as dictated by the foreign policy of the Soviet Union.\\" The League's sudden pacifism during the pact, and equally sudden reversion to pro-war militancy upon its breakdown, observed Biddle, left \\"little doubt of its Communist control.\\" cited in As he was not a librarian, the American Library Association (ALA) opposed MacLeish's candidacy, but when FDR made his appointment, the PLC candidate got the nod.In 1948, following the death of Soviet agent Laurence Duggan--ten days after Duggan implicated Henry Collins and Frederick Vanderbilt Field in espionage, and five days after Alger Hiss's indictment by a grand jury (Christopher D. O'Sullivan, \\"8. Resignation,\\" Sumner Welles, Postwar Planning, and the Quest for a New World Order, 1937-1943 [Columbia University Press, 2007] )--MacLeish would dedicate a poem to Duggan, denouncing \\"informers\\" for their \\"slanders\\" and \\"lies.\\" (Archibald MacLeish, \\"The Black Day,\\" Collected Poems, 1917-1982 [Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 1985] , p. 403) His apparent targets were Hede Massing and Whittaker Chambers, each of whom had identified Duggan. Adolf Berle‚Äôs Notes on his Meeting with Whittaker Chambers (John Earl Haynes, Historical Writings); The PLC also smuggled money to Emilio Andr√©s, commissar of an army corps of the Soviet-backed Spanish Republican Army, Wingeate claims that Andr√©s was killed during World War II, but McReynolds claims that \\"Following World War II, Keeney's wife Mary Jane... met [Andr√©s' wife]... who... died shortly after this meeting. The Keeney's, along with other members of the PLC, continued to send money and clothing to Emilio...\\" in exile in France after the Spanish Civil War. During the Hitler-Stalin pact, the PLC sent a letter to FDR urging him not to aid Poland, France or the United Kingdom, all fighting for their lives under the Nazi onslaught. (The letter had been phrased in such a way that it appeared to be from the ALA, but that group sent the President its own missive clarifying that the PLC did not speak for the ALA.) Once the pact broke down, and Germany invaded the Soviet Union, the PLC altered its position, advocating American participation in the war. Allegations: Communist fronts and Soviet espionage The Keeneys had a long list of political affiliations with alleged \\"Communist fronts\\" such as the Washington Book Shop, identified in 1944 by BiddleThen known as the \\"Washington Cooperative Bookshop\\": See Attorney General's List of Subversive Organizations. and in 1948 by Truman administration Attorney General Tom ClarkThen known as the \\"Washington Bookshop Association\\": See Attorney General's list, Federal Register 13 (20 March 1948), Department of History, University of Minnesota. as a subversive organization. In 1940, \\"Keeney and his wife were signed on apparently by the Neighbors,\\"--code name for Soviet military intelligence (GRU)--according to a 1944 report by NKVD agent Sergey Kurnikov. Government work Despite Keeney's radical political views, activities in several \\"popular front\\" groups and socialization with numerous people involved in Soviet espionage activities, both he and his wife were able to obtain a variety of federal jobs between 1940 and 1947. Within months of the PLC's endorsement of MacLeish for Librarian of Congress, Keeney was working at the Library of Congress in Washington D.C., where he handled classified material. NKVD agent Jacob Golos allegedly met with him there. After the United States became involved in World War II, Keeney transferred to the Office of the Coordinator of Information, which was later transferred to the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), precursor of the CIA. In a 1942 Venona cable discussing infiltration of OSS, \\"Maksim\\" (Rezident Vasily Zarubin, under cover as \\"Vasily Zubilin\\") in New York wrote to \\"Victor\\" (General Pavel Fitin, head of NKVD foreign intelligence) in Moscow, \\"KINI is being entrusted to our agentura,\\"KGB 726-729 New York to Moscow 22 May 1942 , p. 5 (National Security Agency) meaning that recruitment was being undertaken. A note from U.S. cryptographers states \\"KINI: If correct, probably Philip Olin KEENEY.\\"KGB 726-729 New York to Moscow 22 May 1942 , p. 7 (National Security Agency) From 1943 to 1945, Keeney was Chief of the Document Security Section in the Foreign Economic Administration. His wife, meanwhile, worked in the Bureau of Economic Warfare. In 1945, Keeney was allegedly transferred from the GRU to the NKVD. In late 1945 he was hired as a social science researcher in the Supreme Command for the Allied Powers (SCAP) in Tokyo in occupied Japan. Later, designated \\"Libraries Officer\\" in the SCAP Civil Information and Education Section, he played an important role in promoting the revival and reform of library services in Japan. He negotiated the return of library buildings requisitioned by the Military Government and fostered the renewal of the Japan Library Association. His memorandum \\"Unified Library Services for Japan\\" of 8 April 1946 (aka The Keeney Plan) was a set of recommendations based on the California County Library System and stimulated discussion of new library legislation but was very incompletely reflected in the eventual Library Law of 1950. His wife worked in France for the Allied Staff on Reparations. Both Keeneys had numerous contacts with Russian agents and sought to provide them with information, exerting \\"considerable effort\\" seeking to \\"contribute something of value to the Soviet cause in which they believed...\\" Investigations In 1942 J. Edgar Hoover, Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, demanded that Keeney be fired from the Library of Congress as a subversive. After investigating the Librarian, Archibald MacLeish, concluded that there was no evidence to support the charge and, when challenged, Hoover did not provide any and Keeney was retained.Verner W. Clapp letter to P. O. Keeney, Dec 7, 1942. In Philip Olin Keeney Papers. In 1946, the State Department prepared a Top Secret chart identifying 124 loyalty or security cases on the department payroll. Later that year, State Department official Samuel Klaus prepared a 106-page confidential memo summarizing security data on each of the cases listed on the chart. One of these was Mary Jane Keeney. A 1946 congressional report named Keeney's wife, and in 1947 both lost their federal jobs and were denied passports. Within three months, Keeney attempted to leave the country without a valid passport, on the same Polish ship on which Comintern agent Gerhardt Eisler had escaped to the East bloc; the lawyer who encouraged him in this unsuccessful attempt to leave the country was Eisler's attorney. During the Judith Coplon spy trial that year, FBI surveillance records were published that implicated Keeney's wife as a courier for the Communist Party, observed upon her return from France in 1946 delivering a manila envelope to Bernstein, which he in turn delivered to Alexander Trachtenberg. Mary Jane herself admitted associating with Nathan Gregory Silvermaster and William Ludwig Ullmann. In 1949, Keeney was a sponsor of the National Conference on American Policy in China and the Far East and the Scientific and Cultural Conference for World Peace, both arranged by the National Council of the Arts, Sciences, and Professions, cited as subversive by the California Committee on Un-American Activities. Despite all this, by the following year, Mary Jane was working in the Document Control Section of the United Nations secretariat. After Sen. Joseph McCarthy publicized this in his 1950 speech in Wheeling, West Virginia, she was dismissed. The Keeneys refused to answer questions regarding membership in the Communist Party. In 1952, they were convicted on contempt of Congress for refusing to answer questions before a Senate committee, though their convictions were later reversed on appeal. Later life In their later years, the Keeneys are variously reported to have founded and run a cinema club in Washington, D.C. between 1952 and 1958, showing art films, and reportedly opened a beatnik theatre in Greenwich Village called Club Cinema to air mostly foreign-language films with subtitles, with occasional folksingers or poetry readings. Keeney died in 1962 at the age of 71. He was survived by his wife. Venona After the National Security Agency declassified the Venona project in 1995, John Earl Haynes, Cold War historian in the Manuscript Division of the Library of Congress, identified Philip Keeney with the code name \\"Bredan.\\" References Sources * John Earl Haynes and Harvey Klehr, Venona: Decoding Soviet Espionage in America, Yale University Press (1999). * Philip Olin Keeney Papers.

Fenwick was founded in 1929 as part of the Province of St. Albert the Great (Dominican Friars). It is the only school directly operated and staffed by the Catholic Order of Dominican friars in the United States. It is named in honor of Cincinnati Bishop Edward D. Fenwick. History Bishop Edward D. Fenwick, the namesake of Fenwick High SchoolFenwick's school chapel with stained glass windows created by Rinaldo Angelo Zarlenga, O.P., a Dominican Blackfriar from Rome,Italy Fenwick High School was founded as an all-boys college preparatory high school in 1929 by the Catholic Order of Dominican Fathers and Brothers of the Province of St. Joseph. Since its founding, Fenwick has maintained a strict dress code which includes slacks, dress shirts and ties for the boys and plaid skirts and knee- high socks for the girls. During assemblies, blazers must be worn. Fenwick was originally intended to be a prep school for matriculation to the University of Notre Dame in the Midwest and Georgetown University on the East Coast, similar to Phillips Academy Andover's matriculation to Yale, Portsmouth Abbey School's matriculation to Fordham University and Boston College and Phillips Exeter Academy's matriculation to Harvard. Today, Fenwick's students matriculate to many top American and international universities.The Magazine, Fall 2007, Robert Dixon, Oak Park, Il. In 1939, the St. Joseph Province was divided and Fenwick High School became part of the new Province of St. Albert the Great, with headquarters in Chicago. Fenwick became coeducational in 1992, rather than raise tuition costs or see enrollment decline. Today, Fenwick is known as a secondary school. Students have access to many athletic facilities, including a baseball field, two football fields, a softball diamond, a pool, and a soccer field on the campus of Fenwick's Dominican Priory in the nearby suburb of River Forest. Since its founding, Fenwick has maintained a 100% college matriculation rate. In 1983 Fenwick was selected by the U.S. Department of Education as a Blue Ribbon School. On January 18, 1999, U.S. News & World Report classified Fenwick as an \\"Outstanding American High School\\", making Fenwick tied for the #1 ranked preparatory school in the Chicago area. For 2009, Fenwick's 290 student class had 211 of them receive 718 academic scholarships to top universities around the country with the monetary value of these awards in excess of $16,000,000 (up from $13,900,000 in 2008-2007, $12,555,800 in 2007-2006 and 9,370,000 in 2006‚Äì 2005). The 2009 graduating class also boasted 187 Presidential Scholars and 30 National Merit Finalists, with 22 additional receiving commendation for being named to the top 5% in the nation.The Magazine, Fall 2007, Robert Dixon, Oak Park, Il. p.26 Fenwick's 2010‚Äì2011 class achieved $40,000,000 in merit based scholarships.\\"About Fenwick scition: Welcome to Fenwick High School Home of the Friars\\". Around the time Fenwick started admitting girls, there was a proposal to officially move classes to the school's priory in River Forest, or construct a brand new school in collaboration with nearby Trinity High School, its all-girls counterpart run by the Dominican Sisters. The idea almost passed, but was dropped when Fenwick insisted on maintaining complete control over the standards of the new school. Instead, Fenwick has commenced several expansion campaigns at their present location in Oak Park based around their original Neo-gothic designed school created by the New York architect Wilfred E. Anthony, who also redesigned the Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Indiana for the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana. The latest expansions include: a new field house with a 1,100-seat gymnasium and a 450-seat natatorium; several new classrooms and updated athletic lockers; a new school entrance and gateway inspired from the Arch of Northwestern University; and additional science laboratories and art studios, all of which are in keeping with the original Neo-gothic look of Fenwick's school and priory. Fenwick is the only high school in the United States owned and operated by the Dominican Order. Fenwick's school mottoes are the same as those of the Dominican Order: Laudare, Benedicere, Praedicare (praise, bless, preach); Veritas (truth); Contemplare et Contemplata Aliis Tradere (to study and hand on the fruits of study). Fenwick often uses the Blackfriar as a mascot over a generic friar mascot since the Blackfriar is specifically associated with the Dominican Order. Academics Fenwick's Gothic Tower The first sentence of the school's philosophy statement, defines the school as a \\"college preparatory high school\\". Students are required to study four years of theology, English, mathematics, and a foreign language in order to graduate. As a part of the third year theology course, students are required to plan and conduct a \\"Christian Service Project\\". The project requires a minimum of thirty hours of service, no more than 20 of which may be completed prior to the start of the student's junior year. The school offers 20 courses as a part of the Advanced Placement program: English Language, English Literature, Art History, French Language, Spanish Language Latin Language, Statistics, Computer Science A, Biology, Chemistry, Physics (C), Physics 1, Physics 2, Environmental Science, Psychology, U.S. History, European History, Economics, World History, and U.S. Government. The school offers AP Calculus BC, and gives students the option to take either the \\"AB\\" or \\"BC\\" test at the end of the year. Beyond AP Calculus, the school offers courses in multivariable calculus, linear algebra and differential equations. Extracurricular achievements =Athletics= Fenwick's football pennant graphics from the 1930s The Fenwick Friars compete in two conferences. Male teams compete in the Chicago Catholic League (CCL), while the female teams compete in the East Suburban Catholic Conference. The school competes in state championship series sponsored by the Illinois High School Association (IHSA). The following teams have finished in the top four of their respective state tournament sponsored by the IHSA: *basketball (girls) ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ 3rd place (1999‚Äì2000, 2003‚Äì04); 2nd place (2002‚Äì03); State Champions (2000‚Äì01, 2006‚Äì07) *soccer (girls) ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ 3rd place (2013); 4th place (2003‚Äì04) *softball ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ 4th place (1997‚Äì98) *swimming & diving (boys) ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ 4th place (1985‚Äì86); 3rd place (1975‚Äì76, 1993‚Äì94, 2005‚Äì06); 2nd place (1974‚Äì75, 1976‚Äì77, 1977‚Äì78, 1981‚Äì82, 1984‚Äì85, 1992‚Äì93); State Champions (1989‚Äì90, 1990‚Äì91, 1991‚Äì92) *swimming & diving (girls) 3rd place 2009, 2nd place 2011, 2nd place 2012 *water polo (boys) ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ State Champions (2001‚Äì02, 2003‚Äì04, 2004‚Äì05, 2005‚Äì06, 2006‚Äì07, 2007‚Äì08, 2008‚Äì09, 2009‚Äì10, 2010‚Äì11, 2012‚Äì13) *water polo (girls) ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ 3rd place (201415, 201617); 2nd place (2006‚Äì07); State Champions (2003‚Äì04, 2004‚Äì05, 2005‚Äì06, 2007‚Äì08, 2008‚Äì09, 2010‚Äì11, 2011‚Äì12, 2013‚Äì14, 201516) The boys' varsity hockey team has played in the state championship game, held at the United Center, in five consecutive seasons (2002‚Äì2006), winning the state title (the Blackhawk Cup) in the 2002‚Äì03 and 2003‚Äì04 seasons. The 2003‚Äì2004 team compiled a record of 62‚Äì9‚Äì2 and is considered one of Illinois' most accomplished high school hockey teams to have ever played in the Midwest. The hockey team has won five straight Kennedy Cups, three of them over their hockey archrival Loyola Academy. The boys lacrosse team took the state championship in just its second year as a varsity program. Fenwick has been a dominant force in water polo. Since the IHSA first started sponsoring a water polo state tournament in 2002, Fenwick's men's and women's teams have won a combined eleven of the first fourteen state championships. Fenwick's football team playing in the Prep Bowl at Soldier Field of the Chicago BearsFenwick's undefeated football team, the 1962 Prep Bowl Champions Prior to the institution of a state playoff system for football in the 1970s, Fenwick competed to play in the Prep Bowl, which pitted the champions of the CCL against the champion of the Chicago Public League. Fenwick won two Prep Bowl titles at the game's usual home of Soldier Field. The first was in 1945 where a crowd of 80,000 fans saw Fenwick defeat Tilden High School, 20‚Äì6. The second was in 1962, and saw Fenwick defeat Schurz High School, 40‚Äì0. The win not only capped an undefeated season, but was played before over 91,000 fans; the third largest crowd to witness a high school football game in Illinois history. The 1945 game is tied for seventh in terms of crowd size. By 2007, Fenwick had over 77 all-conference championships. The boy's JV hockey team and the girls pom pom team have also earned state championships. Sports Illustrated has added Fenwick to its list of the \\"50 Best High School Athletic Programs in the Country\\", recognizing Fenwick as having the best athletic program in Illinois. Fenwick's 2006‚Äì2007 swimming and swim/polo teams produced 12 NISCA Academic All-American athletes. 7 boys listed. 5 girls listed. For 2009, two state championships were achieved in water polo. 11 regional, sectional or supersectional championships were earned, along with 15 conference titles. There was also 17 All-State athletes, 19 All-American athletes and 12 All-Academic athletes named. 5 students were granted NCAA Athletic scholarshipsFenwick, The Magazine, Summer 2009, =Non- athletic activities= Fenwick's academic teams are also highly competitive. The Math Team was state champion in 2002, in large part to the great teaching of Roger Finnell, a teacher there for 50 years now, and has also been the highest scoring private school in the AA Division for 14 years in a row. 2009 marks the 16th consecutive year for Fenwick's Math Team to qualify for state. Fenwick's Scholastic Bowl Team has been league champions for the last 4 years, and has twice finished in the top four at the Illinois High School Association State Championship Tournament (2001 & 2004). Fenwick is the 2011 Chicago Conference Chess Champions. Fenwick's Worldwide Youth in Science and Engineering (WYSE) and Junior Engineering Technical Society (JETS) teams are also highly accomplished; Fenwick's WYSE/JETS teams were national champions in 1989 are 13-time Illinois state champions. 2011 marks the 8th consecutive year to be so. The 2011 JETS team placed first in their conference with the highest possible score of 74/80, earning a \\"Best in the State\\" award and a 2nd place national ranking from 1229 teams of 43 states. Fenwick's team was only one point behind the first place nationally ranked team. After a two year championship drought, Fenwick placed first in the state and fifth in the world in TEAMS, beating teams such as University of Chicago Lab and Marist High School. The Wick (school newspaper), The Blackfriars Yearbook, and the Touchstone (literary magazine), have all been recognized with awards by the American Scholastic Press Association. The 2006‚Äì2007 edition of Touchstone was awarded first place with special honors by the American Scholastic Press Association, placing Fenwick's publication at the top 5% of all high school literary publications in the country. Touchstone has earned 970/1000 possible points by the American Scholastic Press Association, thereby allowing it to be a contender for the \\"Most Outstanding High School Literary and Art Magazine\\". The Fenwick Student Congressional Debate team is also ranked highly. In 2014, Fenwick Student Congress ranked 1st in the Northern Illinois District Sectionals, and had the most semi-finalists in State out of any high school. Student Congress has also been 1st in the Chicago Catholic Forensics League for five years in a row. 2015 will also mark the 10th year that fenwick has brought students to the highly prestigious Harvard, Yale, and Isidore Newman national tournaments.

It used to include the extremely abundant common house spider, which was transferred to genus Parasteatoda in 2006, together with many other species. A. veruculata and many more species were moved to genus Cryptachaea in 2008. Others were moved to the revived Henziectypus. The genus was thus reduced from about 150 species to about 22 species during major revisions. Possibly even more species should be transferred to other genera. Description This genus includes small and large theridiids. The legs are medium long, with spines and usually many hairs. Their web is an irregular network of threads, usually in a sheltered place. Distribution Species are found around the world, with several species from South America, China and Korea, India, Australia and Africa. Some species are endemic to several small islands.

The town lies in the western branch of the Albertine Rift between Lakes Edward and Kivu. The Ugandan border is 15 km east and the Rwandan border is 30 km south-east. Lava flows from the Nyamuragira volcano, 40 km south- west, have come within 7 km of the town in recent years. It is the largest town formerly controlled by the rebel National Congress for the Defence of the People faction. As of November 2012, the town was a stronghold of the rebel, or self-styled 'revolutionary' March 23 Movement. After the defeat of the M23 Movement the town was retaken by the Congolese army, and President Joseph Kabila paid a visit to the town in November 2013 after driving from Kisangani. Rwandan Genocide and Congo Wars Rutshuru has a Congolese Hutu population that has been there long time before colonial times, and following the Rwandan genocide large numbers of Rwandan Hutu refugees were housed in camps there. The First and Second Congo Wars saw much fighting in the district involving Ugandan, Rwandan and Congolese forces of various factions. Since the official end of the war in 2002/3, fighting has periodically erupted between militias allied to the Hutu and Tutsi. The town has always been occupied by proxy forces linked to Rwandan president Paul Kagame and has since the advent of the Rwandan genocide been the focal of troubles between Tutsi and Hutu with stakes in Rwanda. At the onset of all the Rwanda's invasion of Congo, Tutsi troops loyal to Kagame have been linked to massive looting and mass rapes of Congolese locals. Rutshuru much like most of the DR Congo western region is a town of collateral damage from infighting between Rwandan proxies and local populations. Mining The Lueshe Mine is located in the Territoire de Rutshuru, north of Rutshuru town, exploiting one of the world's biggest reserves of pyrochlore, an ore of niobium.https://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/181/33658.html It is said to be the most valuable mineral resource of the eastern Congo but the mine has been officially closed for some years due to disputes over ownership of mining rights, the instability of the region, and the need to rehabilitate the mining equipment. Smuggling of pyrochlore by rebels under Laurent Nkunda is said to take place across the border into Rwanda.David Barouski: \\"'Blood Minerals' in the Kivu Provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\\" Z Magazine online, (www.zmag.org), June 1, 2007.

Catholic Priest wearing a cappello romano. A cappello romano (pl. cappelli romani; Italian: \\"\\") or saturno (pl. saturni; because its appearance is reminiscent of the ringed planet Saturn) is a hat with a wide, circular brim and a rounded crown worn outdoors in some countries by Catholic clergy, when dressed in a cassock. It is made of either beaver fur, felt or straw and lined in white silk. Unlike many other articles of clerical clothing, it serves no ceremonial purpose, being primarily a practical item. (The galero is a ceremonial wide brim hat no longer usually worn, though on February 19, 2011, Raymond Cardinal Burke became the first cardinal in recent times to wear (for a single photo) the galero.) The cappello romano is not used in liturgical services. Since the general abandonment of the cassock as street dress, it is uncommon even in Rome today, though it was quite popular there and in some other countries with a Catholic majority population from the 17th century until around 1970. There are some, mostly minor, differences in the designs of cappelli, depending on the rank of the wearer. The pope wears a red cappello with gold cords. Cardinals formerly also had the privilege of wearing a red cappello, but this rule was overturned by Pope Paul VI, and now Cardinals' cappelli are black, as are those of all other clerics. A cardinal may have a cappello with red and gold cords with scarlet lining. A bishop's may have green and gold cords with violet lining. A priest may substitute black lining for his.

It is the capital of √âquateur Province. The headquarters of the Fourth Naval Region of the Navy of the Democratic Republic of the Congo are located in Mbandaka.  Geography  Mbandaka lies on the east bank of the Congo River below the mouth of the Tshuapa River, a tributary of the Congo. South of the Ngiri Reserve, a large area of swamp forest on the opposite bank of the Congo, it is located at the center of the Tumba-Ngiri-Maindombe Ramsar wetland. Description Mbandaka is the capital of √âquateur province, and located only a few miles/kilometres from the equator. It is home to Mbandaka airport and is linked by riverboat to Kinshasa and Boende. It is located in a busy travel corridor upriver from the capital, Kinshasa. The latter city of about 10 million is an hour's plane ride away, or a four- to seven-day trip by river barge. Mbandaka is largely populated by people of the Mongo ethnic group, although people from many different tribes and regions live in the city. The main languages spoken in Mbandaka are Lingala, French, and Mongo. Years of war and neglect have caused deterioration of the city infrastructure; large areas of the city are without electricity or running water. Most of the streets and avenues of the city are unpaved dirt roads. History Bank of the Belgian Congo building Mbandaka was founded in 1883 by English explorer Henry Morton Stanley, who named it \\"√âquateurville\\". (At the time the territory was under Belgian rule and the official language was French.) The town hall is about north of the equator. Mbandaka is one of the closest to the equator of any substantial city in the world. Stanley placed a large \\"Equator Stone\\" near the riverbank south of the city to mark the point where he believed the equator crossed the river. It remains there today. Due to its symbolic location close to the equator and the Congo River, there were early plans to locate the capital of the Congo Free State in Mbandaka, but they never came off the drawing board. These plans included infrastructure for an estimated population of 100,000 people, a train station, a Catholic cathedral, a governor's residence, and a palace for future visits of Leopold II of Belgium.Le Congo: de la colonisation belge √† l'ind√©pendance, Auguste Maurel, page 94-95 In 1886, at the beginning of colonial rule, the Belgians changed the city's name to \\"Coquilhatville\\" naming it after Camille-Aim√© Coquilhat. In 1938, work began on a bridge over the Congo River connecting Mbandaka with the French Congo (now the Republic of Congo). Work was abandoned at the outbreak of World War II, and only the foundations of the bridge pillars remain. In the 1930s the Belgian colonial administration began several projects, including factories and a new city hall. The city hall was completed in 1947 after World War II. At that time, with a height of , it was the tallest building in the Belgian Congo. A statue of Leopold II], king of Belgium, was installed on its roof. On top of the city hall stood a statue of Leopold II. The city hall was destroyed by a fire in 1963.Le Congo : de la colonisation belge √† l'ind√©pendance, Auguste Maurel, pp. 153-155 After the Democratic Republic of Congo gained independence, the government changed the name of this city in 1966 to \\"Mbandaka\\" to honor a prominent local leader. =Massacre of Hutus= Near the end of the First Congo War in the late 20th century, hundreds of people (mainly Hutu refugees, women, and children) were massacred here on May 13, 1997. Congolese soldiers said the order came from Col. Wilson, head of a brigade of Kabila's troops, and Col. Richard, the brigade's operations chief, both Rwandans. Gen. Gaston Muyango (Congolese) held the title of military commander but had no real power, they said. =Ebola outbreak= On 16 May 2018, a case of Ebola occurred in the city, the disease having spread there from an outbreak in the countryside. A new outbreak was reported on 1 June 2020. Three cases were confirmed by the WHO and three cases are probable, of whom four people had died as of June 2, 2020.

It flourished in the 19th century, and was prior to the arrival of the Belgians the largest settlement in the Central Congo with an estimated population of 5000 people. Ilebo was connected to other settlements via the river and several sand roads that were passable by porters. In 1901 the Belgian colonial administration renamed Ilebo Port-Francqui. The city rapidly grew under the Belgian colonial administration, especially after the railway line to Lubumbashi was opened. There were plans to extend the railway line to Kinshasa, and the construction of a bridge over the Kasai river began in 1935, but was stopped after the unfinished bridge collapsed on 12 September 1937. During the Second World War the city grew massively in size, due to the influx of workers to the local industry manufacturing arms for the war effort.

The settlement was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as a parish within the Hundred of Willey but was probably first developed in Saxon times. The oldest surviving building, St Peter's Church, is Norman. The name is believed to be derived from the Anglo Saxon word sharn meaning dung. Many of the older buildings in the village are constructed of the local oolitic limestone, also used in other traditional north Bedfordshire settlements. Situated just north of a loop in the River Great Ouse and almost due north of Bedford, the village has developed as a ribbon-settlement running south-east to north-west, with the core of the community clustered at the north-western end. Education The village has two schools, the larger of which Sharnbrook Academy has a campus on the west of the village, serves a wide area and was attended by the marathon world record holder Paula Radcliffe, who opened the Paula Radcliffe Sharnbrook Community Sports Centre named after her in April 2005. This Community Sports Centre is not only for students but also serves the wider local community of North Bedfordshire with sporting facilities. Students are aged from 11 to 18 and take both GCSE and A Level exams. The village's other school is Sharnbrook Primary which caters for young children aged from 3‚Äì11 years old who live in the immediate area. Industry Another major presence is the multinational company Unilever which has a research centre on the north-western edge of the village. This uses the grounds of Colworth House, originally built in the early 17th century and rebuilt in its present form by 1774 as a private house. The house itself is used as office space, with modern laboratory buildings beside and behind it. The site is being turned into a science park for use by a number of companies. Sport Sharnbrook is home to Sharnbrook Women's Football Club which was established in 2002. SWFC currently play in the Beds and Herts Division 1. The club's honours include the 2006/7 Beds and Herts league and cup double and the 2015/16 Beds and Herts Division 2 league title. The team currently play on a Sunday afternoon and wear blue and red vertical striped shirts with interchangeable blue and red shorts and socks. Sharnbrook is home to many other sporting teams that both greatly predate the women's football team and significantly outstrip it in popularity. Transport Sharnbrook railway station opened in 1857, but was closed in 1960. Literature Sharnbrook is the village where the prototype of Uncle Silas, Joseph Betts, the protagonist of H.E. Bates's My Uncle Silas lived.  Wildlife  Sharnbrook is home to a colony of red kites. Britain's youngest father In 1998, Sharnbrook resident Shaun Stewart become the youngest father in Britain at only twelve years of age. He lived next door to the mother of his child, who was four years older than he. The child was conceived when the pair were only 11 and 15.

The pentagrammaton () or Yahshuah () is a constructed form of the Hebrew name of Jesus originally found in the works of Athanasius Kirchner, Johann Baptist Grossschedel (1619) and other late Renaissance esoteric sources. It is to be distinguished from the name Yahshua found in the works of the Sacred Name Movement in the 1960s, though there has been some conflation or confusion between the two. The pentagrammaton Yahshuah has no support in archeological findings, such as the Dead Sea scrolls or inscriptions, nor in rabbinical texts as a form of Joshua. Scholarship generally considers the original form of Jesus to be Yeshua, a Hebrew Bible form of Joshua. The essential idea of the pentagrammaton is of an alphabetic consonantal framework Y-H-Sh-W-H, which can be supplied with vowels in various ways. (Also, the \\"W\\" can be converted into a \\"U\\" or \\"V\\", since the Hebrew letter ◊ï waw writes either a [w] consonant sound‚Äîlater on pronounced [v]‚Äîor a long [u] vowel sound: see Mater Lectionis.)

The first ones to use a name of Jesus something like \\"Yahshuah\\" were Renaissance occultists. In the second half of the 16th century, when knowledge of Biblical Hebrew first began to spread among a significant number of Christians, certain esoterically minded or occultistic circles came up with the idea of deriving the Hebrew name of Jesus by adding the Hebrew letter shin ◊© into the middle of the Tetragrammaton divine name yod-he-waw-he ◊ô◊î◊ï◊î to produce the form yod-he-shin-waw-he ◊ô◊î◊©◊ï◊î. This was given a basic Latin transliteration JHSVH or IHSVH or IHSUH (since there was no letter \\"W\\" or sh / [≈°] sound in Latin, and \\"I\\" and \\"J\\" were then not yet clearly distinguished as letters of the alphabet, nor were \\"U\\" and \\"V\\"). This could then be supplied with further vowels for pronounceability. It was a coincidence that the first three letters of this consonantal transcription IHSVH etc. were identical with the old IHS/JHS monogram of the name of Jesus (from Greek iota-eta-sigma). In Renaissance occultistic works, this pentagrammaton (or five-letter divine name) was frequently arranged around a mystic pentagram, where each of the five Hebrew letters ◊ô ◊î ◊© ◊ï ◊î was placed at one of the points (the letter shin ◊© was always placed at the upward- pointing vertex of the pentagram).Byzant Symbols One of the earliest attested examples of this diagram is in the Calendarium Naturale Magicum Perpetuum or \\"Magical Calendar\\" (published 1620 but dated 1582)\\"Bernard Picart and the first global vision of religion\\" - Page 158 Lynn Avery Hunt, Margaret C. Jacob, W. W.

The Golden Dawn favored the consonantal transcription IHShVH or YHShVH, and the pronunciation Yeheshuah. However, in all early Hebrew or Aramaic sources, the name \\"Jesus\\"/\\"Jeshua\\" actually appears as yod-shin-waw-\`ayin ◊ô◊©◊ï◊¢ Yeshua (or as the related longer form of the same name, yod-he-waw-shin-\`ayin ◊ô◊î◊ï◊©◊¢ \\"Joshua\\"; or as the intentionally altered derogatory Talmudic variant yod- shin-waw ◊ô◊©◊ï Yeshu), so that the Renaissance speculations were incorrect. Note that the letter \`ayin ◊¢ was specifically pronounced as a voiced pharyngeal consonant sound in ancient Hebrew and Aramaic, and could not be easily confused with either a pronounced [h] sound or a silent Hebrew letter he ◊î. Modern \\"Divine Name\\" groups Some modern religious groups have speculated that the most correct form of the Hebrew name of Jesus should be based on the spelling yod-he-shin-waw-\`ayin ◊ô◊î◊©◊ï◊¢ (apparently a reordering of the letters in the Hebrew spelling of the name yod-he-waw-shin-\`ayin ◊ô◊î◊ï◊©◊¢, pronounced [yƒõh≈ç≈°≈´«é\`] and usually translated into English as \\"Joshua\\", but closely connected with the Hebrew form of the name of Jesus). This Hebrew letter sequence yod-he-shin-waw-\`ayin can be transcribed into English in various ways (since Masoretic Niqqud is rejected), including Yahshua, Yahoshua, etc.‚Äîsee Yahshua. When a final \\"H\\" is added on to these transcriptions (e.g., Yahshuah, Yahoshuah etc.), or when such consonantal transcriptions as YHSWH or YHShWH are used (both quite similar to the old transcription JHSVH, given the differences between the English and Latin uses of the alphabet), then it seems rather clear that there is confusion between the name of Jesus and the Tetragrammaton (whether under the influence of the old occultistic \\"Pentagrammaton\\", or independently). The consonantal transcription YHShVH is used both by occultists and Divine Name religious adherents.

Regarded by Amis's readership as possibly his strongest novel, the tone gradually shifts from high comedy, interspersed with deep personal introspections, to a dark sense of foreboding and eventually panic at the approach of the deadline, or \\"horror day\\", the climactic scene alluded to on the very first page.Diedrick, p. 118ff. The story is narrated by Samson Young, an American writer living in London who has had writer's block for 20 years and is now terminally ill. The other main characters are Guy Clinch, the foil; Keith Talent, the cheat; and Nicola Six, the murderee, who knows she will be murdered a few minutes after midnight on 5 November 1999‚Äîher 35th birthday‚Äîand who goes in search of her killer.Diedrick, p. 119. Plot summary London Fields is set in London in 1999 against a backdrop of environmental, social and moral degradation, and the looming threat of world instability and nuclear war (referred to as \\"The Crisis\\"). The novel opens with Samson explaining how grateful he is to have found this story, already formed, already happening, waiting to be written down. > This is the story of a murder. It hasn't happened yet. But it will. (It had > better.) I know the murderer, I know the murderee. I know the time, I know > the place. I know the motive (her motive) and I know the means.

Novelists don't usually have it so > good, do they, when something real happens (something unified, dramatic, and > pretty saleable), and they just write it down?London Fields, p. 1. The characters have few, if any, redeeming features. Samson Young (Sam), the narrator of the novel (who twice emphasizes that he is \\"a reliable narrator\\"), is an American, a failed non-fiction writer with decades-long writer's block, and is slowly dying of some sort of terminal disease. Recently arrived in London, he immediately meets Keith Talent, a cheat (small-time criminal) and aspiring professional darts player, at Heathrow Airport where Keith is posing as a minicab driver. Keith gives Sam an extortionately priced ride into town. The two converse in Keith's car, and Keith invites Sam to the Black Cross, a pub on the Portobello Road, Keith's main hangout. At the Black Cross, Sam meets Guy Clinch, a rich upper-class banker who is bored with life, with his terrifyingly snobbish American wife, Hope, and his out-of-control toddler, Marmaduke. Shortly after, the two both meet the anti-heroine, Nicola Six, a 34-year-old local resident, of uncertain nationality, who has entered the pub after attending a funeral. Later that day, Sam sees Nicola dramatically dumping what turns out to be her diaries in a litter bin outside the flat where he is staying (it belongs to Mark Asprey, a wildly successful English writer). The diaries tell Sam that Nicola believes she can somehow see her own future, and, bored with life and fearing the ageing process, is plotting her own murder for midnight on 5 November, her 35th birthday. Sam, who considers that he lacks the imagination and courage to write fiction, realises he can simply document the progress towards the murder to create a plausible, lucrative, story. He assumes that Keith, the bad guy, will be the murderer. Sam enters into a strange relationship with Nicola where he regularly interviews her and is updated on the \\"plot\\". The novel proceeds on the basis that Keith Talent, the known criminal, will kill Nicola Six, with Guy Clinch as the fall guy necessary to provoke him into doing it (and, incidentally, to provide funds to help Talent avoid being beaten up by loan sharks, and to further his darts career so he can appear in the Sparrow Masters darts final the day before the planned murder). But there is an unexpected twist at the finale. Amis hints at a false ending, in one of Samson Young's terrifying dreams, simply to confuse the reader. Characters Keith regularly cheats on and abuses his wife, Kath. He regularly sleeps with an underage girl in return for cash payments to her mother and has up to six further regular affairs he visits frequently. He drinks, gambles, and takes part in burglaries and semi- violent crime (although he is unable to follow through with actual violent crime). He is addicted to pornography and television to the extent that he is unable to distinguish reality from what is shown on the screen. He has raped several women in the past (including his wife). Nicola is a self-styled \\"murderee\\", who manipulates the entire cast of characters to bring about her own murder so that she will not have to face ageing, a natural process that she hates as she fears the loss of her attractiveness and power to manipulate men, as well as the indignities of decay and old age. She describes herself as a failed suicide, who must find her murderer if she is to end her life. She spins a different story to each of the three male characters (Sam, Keith, and Guy). To Guy, she pretends she is a frigid, sexually timid virgin: she tells him that her childhood in a dreadful orphanage and her friendship with a tragic girl called Enola Gay who is raped by a \\"pitiless Iraqi\\" and who produces a child called Little Boy, has left her unable to form a sexual relationship with any man, but that Guy has awakened the possibility in her. Feigning love for Guy, she teases him sexually at every opportunity, pretending she is too afraid and too unready to \\"go the whole way\\" with him, until his unsatisfiable and excruciating lust induces him to leave his wife and child and to give her a very large sum of money which he believes will help her bring the fictional Enola Gay and Little Boy to London. Nicola insists that Guy leave his wife and son to consummate their relationship, and Guy does so, destroying his family life. To Keith, Nicola styles herself as a rich, knowing woman of the world, a former one-night stand of the Shah of Iran, who recognises him for what he truly is ‚Äì a darts prodigy and future darts and TV personality. She gives Keith Guy's money, which he spends on ridiculous clothes and accessories. Keith, a pornography aficionado (and addict) is kept keen by regular \\"home videos\\" created by Nicola, starring herself. To Sam, Nicola pretends to tell the whole truth, but in fact manipulates him as well, in a way that is apparent to the reader only when Sam himself realises ‚Äì at the end of the story. Guy is an idle, rich dreamer whose relationship with his \\"frightening wife\\" is sexless after the birth of their uncontrollable son, Marmaduke, who seems to have a violent Oedipal complex. Guy cheats on his wife and finally leaves her and his son to be with Nicola, although at the end, when he realises what Nicola is, he goes back home. Sam is a failed writer who selfishly uses the three main characters to have a chance at writing a popular and successful novel. Although he knows that Keith is abusing his wife and someone is abusing their baby daughter, he does not intervene until the very end to remove the child from Keith's care. Unreliable narrators One of the central themes of the novel is the link between reading and information-gathering, and the (un)reliability of written information, of narrators and narrative. Frederick Holmes writes that the novel dramatises a contest for authorship. All the main characters are authors of one kind or another, supplying Sam with written material, competing with each other to shape the narrative: Nicola's diaries, Guy's short stories and Keith's own darting diary together with his cheat's brochure of goods and services.Holmes, p. 53. In the shadows of the novel is the mysterious Mark Asprey, whose pen-name, or one of them, is also Marius Appleby, initials MA (the same as Martin Amis). As Mark Asprey, he writes what appear to be highly popular fiction, translated into innumerable languages. As Marius Appleby, he writes what appears to be a true-life memoir of his seduction of a large- bosomed lady on an exotic foreign exploration. But (as we learn at every turn) the written word deceives us: Asprey prints his own translations to look impressive and Appleby's memoir is exaggerated to the point of being untrue. At the end of the novel, it appears that Asprey has appropriated Sam's narrative for his own. Asprey is not famous for writing: he is famous for being famous ‚Äì for publicity. One of the protagonists in Appleby's \\"memoir\\" complains of the inaccuracies in the text in a magazine article ‚Äì another gossip column, a piece of popular media, whose own accuracy we cannot trust. Mass media has corrupted the ability to read and led to disorientation, heavy reliance is placed on gossip and tabloids, neither of which can pass any test of accuracy. When Kath, Keith's wife, wants to read \\"the proper papers\\", she has to go to the library: her husband's tabloids don't make any mention of world affairs, it is impossible to tell what is happening from them. Keith's obsession with television, and with the fast-forwarded, freeze-frame version of television that he screens nightly, and with his tabloid newspaper \\"The Daily Lark\\", is so great that he becomes confused with reality. When he stars in the darts \\"docu-drama\\" ‚Äì itself implying a dangerous mixture, or confusion, of reality and TV-fiction, he is unable to cope with the concept and it is Nicola who must \\"translate him\\" for TV. =London Fields and literary geography= London Fields is a park in Hackney, east London, but the novel is set in west London, like most of Amis's work. The park in which the narrator, Sam, walks with various characters ‚Äì Nicola Six, Guy Clinch and Keith Talent ‚Äì is Hyde Park in central London. Sam reminisces that he played in \\"London Fields\\" as a boy, and wants to return there before his death. It is not clear whether the \\"London Fields\\" he refers to is the real-life East London park, or whether it has another meaning. The title suggests a paradox: a rural or pastoral place within a modern urban setting. Sam's narrative refers again to this inherent paradox, as he remarks that in London \\"there are no fields\\", only fields of attraction and repulsion, only force fields. The title indicates to the reader the ambiguities inherent in Amis's creation of an imagined London: there is a conflict between the descriptions of London locations within the novel and their location in reality. The topography of the imagined city cannot fit exactly onto the topography of the real city. Just as Sam realises that \\"this is London and there are no fields\\", and just as he is unable to return to the \\"London Fields\\" of his childhood, it is similarly impossible for us to return to the stage of London as a field. London Fields exists simultaneously as a real place in the real London, and as an imagined and dreamed-of place \\"present all along\\" on every page of the novel, and the scene of a murder. A theme in London Fields is pub culture, specifically the culture of Keith's \\"local\\" The Black Cross. The book also references The Marquis of Edenderry, a pub in the West London suburb of Acton. One of Keith Talent's darts matches takes place in the Marquis of Edenderry. Keith Talent also drinks at a late-night drinking club called The Golgotha. Reception Simon Schama commented in 2011: :\\"Martin Amis' glorious fury, London Fields; the never-likely-to-be-bettered bedtime story from the heart of Mrs Thatcher's darkest Albion; stained with punk spit and pub puke; glossy as polished leather and sexy as hell. Amis' masterpiece isn't exactly neglected but neither is it established as one of the all-time great London novels, but that's what it is. Thick with allegory; packed with characters you'll never forget; a rendezvous with desire, craziness and death; what more could you want?\\"\\" Bette Pesetsky of The New York Times identified the recurring problem of female characterisation within Amis' novels as a salient one in London Fields. Bette Pesetsky wrote that the character of Nicola Six was \\"not truly satisfying as character or caricature. She seems to be another of Mr. Amis's plastic women.\\" The review concluded that the book \\"succeeds, however, as a picaresque novel rich in its effects\\". Film adaptation David Cronenberg was attached in 2001 to do a film adaptation of the book, and Amis wrote a draft of the script. However, Cronenberg would leave the film for A History of Violence and Eastern Promises. Other directors attached include David Mackenzie and Michael Winterbottom. The film entered production in September 2013 in London, England. Billy Bob Thornton plays the narrator Samson. The cast also includes Amber Heard, Jim Sturgess, Cara Delevingne, Johnny Depp and Theo James. Mathew Cullen is directing. It had a wide release in US theaters on October 26, 2018 and is a massive critical and commercial failure. The score was written and produced by Toydrum and Benson Taylor.

Brind is a leading advocate of the abortion-breast cancer hypothesis, which posits that abortion increases the risk of breast cancer.Chris Mooney, Research and Destroy: How the Religious Right Promotes Its Own 'Experts' to Combat Mainstream Science, Washington Monthly (October 2004). This idea is rejected by mainstream medical professional organizations and there is overwhelming evidence in the peer-reviewed medical literature debunking it. Brind is openly contemptuous of mainstream medical professional organizations and journals, accusing them of conducting a deliberate cover-up with the goal of \\"protecting the abortion industry.\\" Brind asserts that the National Cancer Institute \\"is just another corrupt federal agency like the IRS and the NSA.\\"Joel Brind, , LifeNews (December 2, 2013). Early life, education, and religious conversion Brind grew up in Laurelton, Queens, where he decided he wanted to become a biochemist at the age of 10 after reading an issue of Life magazine where the cover story described the discoveries scientists had recently made about the inner workings of the cell, using electron microscopy. He has a bachelor's degree from Yale (1971) and a Ph.D. from New York University in biochemistry, immunology and physiology. Four years after receiving his PhD in 1981, Brind had a spiritual awakening, after which he converted to Christianity, and decided to try to use science to pursue what he saw as a \\"noble task\\" of discouraging women from having abortions. Advocacy Working on studies concerning amino acid metabolism and aging, Brind concluded that most diets are deficient in the amino acid glycine, and that this deficiency is responsible for illnesses caused by chronic inflammation, including arthritis, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer. These conclusions are not supported by mainstream medicine.http://www.webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/glycine-uses-and-risks He also attributes what are thought to be normal responses such as pain and stiffness following strenuous exercise and injury, to glycine deficiency. In 2010, Brind founded Natural Food Science, LLC, through which glycine supplement products Proglyta and Sweetamine are manufactured and sold. Following his conversion to Christianity, Brind began working as a consultant and expert witness for the anti-abortion cause.Barry Yeoman, The scientist who hated abortion, Discover (February 2003). Discover magazine reported in 2003 that since 1997, \\"Brind has spent about 90 percent of his time outside the classroom investigating and publicizing\\" his claimed abortion-breast cancer link, testifying \\"in courthouses and statehouses in Arizona, Florida, Massachusetts, Ohio, North Dakota, New Hampshire, and Alaska.\\" He fought against the legalization of RU-486, testifying at a federal hearing that \\"thousands upon thousands\\" of women would develop breast cancer as a result of using the drug. Brind was an invitee to the National Cancer Institute's conference on the abortion-breast-cancer issue where he was the only member to file a dissenting opinion. In a meeting between Colorado Right To Life and the Denver affiliate of Susan G. Komen for the Cure regarding Komen grants to Planned Parenthood, Brind urged the breast cancer group to re-consider the idea that abortion is linked to breast cancer. In 1999, Brind co-founded the Breast Cancer Prevention Institute, a non-profit group which promotes a link between abortion and breast cancer. The group is identified in the academic literature as an anti-abortion activist group that promotes \\"the notion that a link to cancer has been both irrefutably proved and deliberately concealed by the medical establishment.\\" Meta-analysis Brind et al. (1996) conducted a meta-analysis of 23 independent epidemiologic studies. It calculated that there was on average a relative risk of 1.3 (1.2 - 1.4) increased risk of breast cancer. The meta-analysis was criticized in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute for ignoring the role of response bias and for a \\"blurring of association with causation.\\" It was also criticized for selection bias by using studies with widely varying results, using different types of studies and not working with the raw data from several studies, and including studies that have methodological weaknesses.SkepticFiles.org: Study Linking Breast Cancer, Abortion Widely Criticized The statistician who collaborated with Brind later stated of their findings: \\"I have some doubts. I don't think the issue has been resolved. When we were talking about the conclusions, he [Brind] wanted to make the strongest statements. I tried to temper them a little bit, but Dr. Brind is very adamant about his opinion.\\" =Criticism= Experts believe Brind overlooks the methodological weaknesses of some studies he uses as evidence for an abortion-breast cancer link. Furthermore, medical researchers note Brind overstates his findings since his own research shows a \\"barely statistically significant\\" increase in breast cancer rates. In reaction to the criticism an editor of the journal that published Brind's study noted with concern: > However, in the light of recent unease about appropriate but open > communication of risks associated with oral contraceptive pills, it will > surely be agreed that open discussion of risks is vital and must include the > people ‚Äì in this case the women ‚Äì concerned. I believe that if you take a > view (as I do), which is often called 'pro-choice', you need at the same > time to have a view which might be called 'pro-information' without > excessive paternalistic censorship (or interpretation) of the data.

L'Ora: la sua storia, Agave (Contributo allo studio delle fonti della storia dell'arte in Italia nel Novecento - Universit√† degli Studi di Palermo) Founder The founder of the dynasty was Vincenzo Florio Sr. (1799-1868), who gave impulse to the tuna fishing and its canned preparation in Palermo. He also was involved in the sulfur industry and founded a bank. In 1832 he established a factory of Marsala wine and, in 1841, the Oretea foundry. As a ship owner he promoted the development of maritime communications with the continent, building numerous steamers. His son Ignazio Florio Sr. (1838-1891) considerably developed all the other industries founded by his father. In the beginning of the 1900s, the family had to face an increasingly deteriorated economic reality in Sicily and suffered failures and closures of activities. Florio winery Founded in Marsala in 1832 by Vincenzo Florio Sr., the Florio winery (Cantine Florio) has been in continuous Marsala wine production since then. Florio became the first Italian producer of Marsala wine. He built splendid cellars in the town's tuff rock in which to produce and conserve the wine. The winery carries the emblem of a lion. Shipping In October 1861, soon after Sicily was incorporated into the Kingdom of Italy, Vincenzo Florio Sr. founded the Societa in Accomandita Piroscafi Postali-Ignazio & Vicenzo Florio (Florio Line) with a fleet of nine steamers.Florio Line / Societ√† in Accomandita Piroscafi Postali-Ignazio & Vicenzo Florio, TheShipsList (retrieved 13 April 2018) In 1881, Ignazio Florio Sr. merged with the Rubattino company in Genoa, giving rise to the Navigazione Generale Italiana, which operated a line on New York City. The company also ran to Mediterranean and Black Sea ports, Canada, India, the Far East and South America.Navigazione Generale Italiana Line, TheShipsList (retrieved 13 April 2018) At the time of the merger, the Florio Line was already a major company with a monopoly of the trade in the Mediterranean. The New York Times described the Florios as the \\"merchant princes of Europe\\". The Florio Line brought 50 ships into the merger, while Rubattino contributed 40.American Trade With Italy; A New Steam-Ship Line Started To Foster It, The New York Times, June 19, 1881, Page 8 The Cantiere navale di Palermo (Palermo Shipyard) in Palermo, Sicily, was founded in 1897 by Ignazio Florio Jr., grandson of Vincenzo Florio. Construction was protracted and Florio was forced to sell his stake in the shipyard to Attilio Odero in 1905. Newspaper The newspaper L'Ora was founded on the initiative of the Florio family in Palermo. The first issue was published on April 22, 1900. The formal owner was Carlo Di Rudin√¨, the son of the former prime minister of Italy Antonio Di Rudin√¨, but the main shareholder and financier was Ignazio Florio Jr.. The political direction of the newspaper was generally republican and progressive, representing the Sicilian entrepreneurial middle class. Motor racing In 1906, Vincenzo Florio created the Targa Florio, one of the oldest car races in the world. The first Targa Florio covered 277 miles through multiple hairpin curves on treacherous mountain roads where severe changes in climate frequently occurred and racers even faced bandits and irate shepherds. The race passed through many small villages, and fans lined up along the roads with no protection from the race cars. It was suspended in 1978 because of safety concerns. Today, the race continues with a different circuit as a minor racing event.

An updated version of the game called World War Zero was later released for the PlayStation 2 and Microsoft Windows. Set in an alternate history in which World War I never ended, the game takes place in 1964, the 50th year of the war, and focuses on an Allied soldier's mission to stop the Russo-Mongolian Empire from developing nuclear weapons and his later efforts to end the war. Gameplay Gameplay in Iron Storm Iron Storm displays a mix between World War I siege tactics, such as trench warfare and the use of mustard gas, and some World War II-style weapons such as machine guns, mortars, tanks, and rocket launchers of that era, as well as more contemporary technology such as helicopters, wireless communication, spy satellites, anti-personnel mines, and unmanned turrets. The player character cannot take much damage before dying, and there are many enemies equipped with powerful weapons such as sniper rifles or anti-tank rifles. Several in-game glitches and vague mission objectives could often force players to replay one level multiple times before finally succeeding. Enemies also behave erratically, as seen when several attempt to walk through walls, or when the player shoots a particular enemy multiple times and yet the enemy remains unscathed.IGN: Iron Storm Review Plot The game is set in an alternate year of 1964, in which World War I never ended. The Baron Nikolai Alexsandrovich von Ugenberg seized Mongolia in 1921 in an uprising following the Russian Revolution, and later invaded Russia itself to crush the Bolsheviks. His plan was to establish a Russo-Mongolian Empire stretching from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic. With the help of the United States, the Allied nations of Europe were reformed as the United States of Western Europe, or the Alliance, in 1933 to counter Ugenberg's plan. Instead of the Great War ending in 1918, it was continued for almost half a century, with the battlelines drawn down Europe's center in 1929 shifting little for either side for the next several decades. As the USWE could no longer independently contribute to the war, the Alliance army was introduced into the American stock market, allowing private investors to speculate on the lives of the soldiers who carried on the war. The outcome of the war now depended almost entirely on the economy of the Alliance's member nations. The player takes on the role as Lieutenant James Anderson, only 19 when he joined the Alliance in 1943, and now a legend among the soldiers in the field. Anderson is recruited for a possibly suicidal mission: to breach enemy defenses and stop the Russo-Mongolians from developing a deadly weapon that could devastate the world. Captain Cecile Newcastle of the British Royal Highlands Regiment is Anderson's immediate supervisor and is responsible for guiding him through his mission. Colonel Mitchell is the commander of the operation, but has an ulterior motive for wanting the mission to succeed. Development =World War Zero= Iron Storm was re-released in 2004 in the UK market for the PlayStation 2 console under the name World War Zero: Iron Storm. While few things were added to the actual gameplay, the graphics were updated and many bugs from the PC version were fixed, and some new weapons were introduced, such as the flamethrower and the minigun. The PlayStation 2 version of Iron Storm was then ported back to the PC in 2005 as World War Zero and published by Reef Entertainment. This version of the game was released only in the UK and Russia.http://buka.ru/cgi-bin/show.pl?id=182 The additions in this third version consisted of support for anti-aliasing and anisotropic filtering, new save points, support for widescreen displays, and bloom lighting. Multiplayer modes were completely cut out along with the majority of the cutscenes, the quick-save feature, and third-person mode. Support for the native resolution of 17\\" and 19\\" TFT screens (1280x1024) was also dropped. The levels were reworked and simplified, and character models were also improved. Reception IGN gave Iron Storm an 8.0 out of 10, citing impressive overall gameplay and a unique storyline, but criticized the game's many glitches, overly-linear levels, and lackluster multiplayer mode. Aggregating review website GameRankings gave the game an overall score of 70.76%.GameRankings: Iron Storm for PC Eurogamer thought the PS2 release was unoriginal and contained elements from many other video games. It was still regarded as a fun game, however; and the multiplayer element was said to be \\"highly commendable\\", though reminiscent of Red Faction 2. It was rated 6/10.https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/r_worldwarzero_ps2 Sequels The first-person shooter Bet On Soldier: Blood Sport has been described as a spiritual sequel to Iron Storm by the game's developers. Many of the people who worked on Bet on Soldier had previously worked on Iron Storm. Although it is never explicitly stated that the two games take place in the same fictional universe, they share many of the same themes and plot elements, and even similar character and weapon designs. Also Bet on Soldier takes place in the 1990 making it an Alternative History and it is never described how the world of Bet on Soldier came about in the game except that the world had been at war for eighty years. Concept art from 2003 indicates that Iron Storm 2 was originally planned to be released. It depicts four levels; the Paris Gun - a super railway gun next to a military train station, a European stock exchange hub, a broken tanker in Alaska next to a base, and a heavily guarded Alaskan oil pipeline.

In January 2019, the brand hired plus-size model Charli Howard to front their Valentine's Day campaign, entitled \\"A Love Letter To Myself\\". =Logo and wordmark= The original Agent Provocateur logo and wordmark were set from an existing over-the-counter typeface. As Corr√©‚Äôs venture grew, graphic design company House Industries redrew and expanded on the logo. They penned a flowing Spencerian wordmark as well as a racy leg logo for products including tissue paper and fabric monograms. Criticism Agent Provocateur had some of its advertisements banned by the Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom) for \\"being degrading to women.\\" References External links *–ö–∞—Ç–∞–ª–æ–≥ –∂–µ–Ω—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –Ω–∏–∂–Ω–µ–≥–æ –±–µ–ª—å—è Agent Provocateur (–†–æ—Å—Å–∏—è) Category:Sports Direct Category:3i Group companies Category:Lingerie brands Category:Clothing companies established in 1994 Category:Retail companies established in 1994 Category:Clothing retailers of England Category:English brands Category:Clothing companies based in London Category:Companies that have entered administration in the United Kingdom ","title":"Agent Provocateur (lingerie)"}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:B}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},R={class:"card-container"};function I(s,e,n,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),o(h,null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("section",null,[a("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâ your bitcoinü•≥")])])],-1)),a("section",null,[a("div",R,[(t(!0),o(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,f)=>(t(),w(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):b("",!0)])],64)}const L=d(P,[["render",I]]),F=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/30.md","filePath":"quotes/30.md"}'),H={name:"quotes/30.md"},E=Object.assign(H,{setup(s){return(e,n)=>(t(),o("div",null,[v(L)]))}});export{F as __pageData,E as default};
