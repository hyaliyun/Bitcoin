Biography  Engineer with a degree from the École supérieure de physique et de chimie industrielles de la ville de Paris (70th class)Ingénieurs de la 70e promotion de l'ESPCI, he joined the Commissariat à l'énergie atomique where he held the position of physicist and then Scientific Director from 1955 to 1993. From 1969 to 1983, he was head of the nuclear magnetism laboratory at the Collège de France. He was a scientific advisor at the CEA from 1993 to 2004. Maurice Goldman is the author of important work in nuclear magnetic resonance, including statistical thermodynamics of spin systems, nuclear relaxation and dynamic polarization, and high-resolution NMR theory in liquids.  Scientific work  Maurice Goldman, after studying isotopic separation and mass spectrometry, joined the Magnetic Resonance Laboratory created by Anatole Abragam at the CEA. Its main work, some of which has led to applications of practical interest, has focused on three main areas. He first conducted studies related to the theory of spin temperature at high temperature:Goldman M., Landesman A., « Polarisation dynamique nucléaire par contact thermique entre des systèmes de spins », C.R. Acad. Sci., 252, (1961), p. 263-265 thermal mixing experiments deepened all aspects of this theory, in particular the concept of spin temperature in the rotating referential, extended to quadrupole interactions, the concept of negative absolute temperature, the extension of the theory of the dynamics of thermal coupling between distinct energy reservoirs, as well as many practical applications of this theory in the form of experimental or theoretical tools. He then studied the nuclear magnetic order in high magnetic field, under the effect of \\"truncated\\" dipole interactions.Chapellier M., et al., « Production et observation d'un état antiferromagnétique nucléaire », C.R.

Hosted by Meredith Vieira (formerly of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire), this show is produced by Dino Bones Productions, Is or Isn't Entertainment, Regular Brand, and distributed by Fox First Run. It first aired in summer 2018 as a three-week summer trial run on nine Fox Television Stations and premiered as a regular series on September 16, 2019. On November 13, 2019, Fox renewed the show for a second season, which launched on September 14, 2020. The second season will feature some staging differences to accommodate for the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, with the two competing teams separated into pods and Vieira hosting remotely from a home studio in New York City.https://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/game-show-host- meredith-vieira-shares-memories-of-regis-philbin  Gameplay  Two three- member teams, consisting of a contestant and two celebrities, compete in the game. =First Round= In the first round, team members are called up to the host's podium, one on one, with the contestants going second in the play order. At the podium, they are shown a list of five words to convey to their teammates in 45 seconds. Starting with a varying number of clue words set by the host as the opening bid, the face-off contestants bid against each other as to how few clue words they can use to complete the round. The bidding continues until one of the contestants concedes to the other contestant's bid. The contestant who wins the bid then plays the game using the number of words they bid. The contestant can pass on a word if it is too difficult, returning back to any passed words if time remains on the clock. Contestants cannot use the word itself as a clue, nor can they use any derivative form of the word in the clue, as doing so will instantly end the round and award their opponent the points. The round also ends if the clue giver goes over the set clue word limit in each round. Additionally, as it is a word game, contestants giving the clues cannot use their hands and must keep them on their handheld tablet. Contestants score 250 points if they are successful in getting all five words within the 45-second time limit. The other team receives the points if the playing team fails to complete the round. As the contestants and celebrities are not in the same studio in Season 2 due to the COVID-19 pandemic preventing them from being together, all participants have an individual tablet in front of them but only the players active in each round see the clues on their tablet, but the rules of the round still apply. =Round 2= Round 2 begins with the contestants at the podium while the celebrities are in a soundproof room offstage. In second season of the show, The celebrities put on their noise-cancelling headphones. Contestants are shown a series of five sets of three words which have been determined by the producers to be of distinct levels of difficulty. Green words are easy to give clues for and are worth 250 points, yellow words are more difficult and are worth 500 points, and red words are the most harder and are worth 1,000 points. The contestants alternate first choice of the three words to place in their own five-word stack, with the trailing contestant choosing first in the first, third and fifth word sets. The contestant who chooses second picks from the remaining two words in the set. The unchosen third word in each set is discarded. Once both contestants set their boards up, each contestant then plays their five words. The trailing contestant goes first. Both contestants have 45 seconds and a set limitation of 20 words. Contestants score the points for each successful word and gains an additional 1,000 point bonus for successfully getting all five. If the contestant gives an illegal clue in this round, the word the illegal clue was given on is thrown out, and the contestant is disqualified from getting the 1,000 point bonus, but the round continues on as normal. If the contestant goes over the 20 word set limitation, the round automatically ends and the contestant is disqualified from getting the 1,000 point bonus as well. If the second team ends up with more points than the first team before all five words were guessed, the round is automatically over and no words after are revealed to the celebrities. The team who has the most points is the champion and moves on to the Money Round to play for $10,000. The losing contestant from the main game receives either a $200 gift card for a varying online retailer or a consolation prize from a varying online retailer. In the event of a tie, both civilian contestants face off at the podium with buzzers. The host will begin giving clues to one final word. The first contestant to buzz in with a correct answer is the champion and advances to the Money Round, while an incorrect answer hands the championship to their opponent. =Bonus Round: The Money Round= In the Money Round, the champion must convey ten words to their celebrity partners in one minute with the maximum of 25 clue words available to them. If the contestant can get the two celebrity partners to get all ten answers correct, the champion wins the grand prize of $10,000. If they do not get all ten correct, the champion receives a varying vacation trip as a consolation prize. If the champion gives an illegal clue or goes over the 25 word limit at any time, the Money Round automatically ends, resulting in the champion forfeiting the shot at the $10,000. No words after are revealed to the celebrities, the audience, or the viewers at home if the contestant didn't give an illegal clue for the last word. For the second season of the show, a new rule was introduced in which the contestants are also playing for a \\"SuperFan\\" who registered via the show's website or on social media accounts. The losing contestant in the main game gets a consolation prize, and the losing SuperFan that they played for gets a $100 gift card. If the champion in the Money Round wins the $10,000, the chosen SuperFan receives $1,000 as well. If the champion fails to win the Money Round (via running out of time/going over the 25 word limit/giving an illegal clue), the chosen SuperFan will receive the $100 gift card.

It was also the worst to hit the region since Talas in 2011, until the region was hit by more destructive Typhoon Hagibis less than a month later. Forming as the fifteenth named storm of the 2019 Pacific typhoon season, the precursor to Faxai was first noted as a weak tropical depression to the east of the International Dateline on August 29. The depression then entered the West Pacific basin on August 30. After moving in a general westward direction, the system strengthened into a named tropical storm by September 5. Faxai then strengthened into the sixth typhoon of the season the next day. Two days later, Faxai reached its peak strength as a Category 4 typhoon just before making landfall in mainland Japan. Turning northeastward, Faxai rapidly weakened and became extratropical on September 10. Three people were killed and 147 others were injured. More than 390,000 people were urged to be evacuated. Faxai left 934,000 households without power. Train services in JR East were cancelled due to the storm. Two people died from heatstroke because of the power outage. Total damages from the typhoon in Japan are currently estimated at US$8.12 billion. Meteorological history At 18:00 UTC on August 29, a tropical depression formed just east of the International Date Line. It moved west across the Pacific Ocean the next day. It was then designated 14W by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center after they initiated advisories. By September 2, the JTWC upgraded 14W to a tropical storm, and maintained its intensity for a couple of days. Three days later, the Japan Meteorological Agency finally upgraded the system to a tropical storm, and named it Faxai. Faxai gradually intensified, reaching typhoon status on September 6. Typhoon Faxai rapidly intensified into a Category 4 storm on September 8 and reaching its peak intensity. Faxai weakened slightly before making landfall in Chichijima Island near Chiba City shortly before 5:00 a.m. JST September 9. Preparations Japan Railway system was suspended with the bullet trains stopped between Tokyo and Odawara. People began leaving by plane as Faxai continued approaching the coast of Japan. On Sunday all trains and flights were suspended with major winds and heavy rain expected to hit Tokyo. According to the Japan Meteorological Agency the storm would reach 134 mph winds when it made landfall. It was said that as much as 300 millimeters of rain could be recorded in Tokyo. Many homes and businesses were boarded up or secured by people across the country. Power was cut to people before the storm hit on Sunday. 13,300 customers at the Narita International Airport were trapped in the airport overnight. Both railways towards the city center were shut down. Passengers were forced to stay inside the airport. The airport handed out 18,000 sets of water and other utensils to customers at the airport. Highways were closed across Japan because of Faxai. U.S. bases had recovery teams ready for action after Faxai made landfall. Airbases all set closures the latest one being a base at the shorline of Tokyo Bay at 11:15 am on September 9. Impact Aftermath of typhoon Faxai at Hōkoku-ji bamboo garden In Tokyo, beach homes had their windows and doors blown out by the storm. Two transmission towers were destroyed which left 100,000 homes and businesses without signal. A blackout across Japan left a Sony Corp, factory to shut down. The blackout stretched across the city of Tokyo with the Tokyo Electric Power Company saying that 730,000 households were without power. Winds caused damage across the area of Honshu damaging homes, knocking out power and uprooting trees. It was recorded that between 3 and 8 inches of rain fell in southeastern Honshu causing minor flooding in the area. It was said that a landslide could be triggered by Faxai, but no landslide had been reported. Faxai was linked to three deaths and a dozen injuries in Japan alone, with more than 850,000 customers without power. Fires were reported at a solar power plant after Faxai and across the Chiba Prefecture farmlands being flooded due to heavy rain across Japan. People were toppled by large wind gusts during the storm with the eyewall passing over Japan damaging many areas. A woman was killed when she was toppled by a wind gust. Transportation systems were closed when Faxai blasted the area. Faxai was recorded as one of the most powerful typhoons to impact Tokyo, with 134 mph winds being recorded in Tokyo. The Tokyo Bay grew by a few inches because of the heavy rainfall total that Faxai dropped. Metal signs were torn off of buildings, trucks were knocked down or overturned, a gas station was destroyed and a glass case was also destroyed leaving broken glass scattered through streets. Television footage showed a huge roof collapsing at a petrol station in Tateyama. Retirement Due to the severe impact in Japan, the name Faxai was retired during the 52nd annual session of the ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee in February 2020. A replacement name will be chosen in early 2021.

She contributed to the illegal newspaper De frie Danske, worked for the Danish-Swedish Refugee Service and joined the British Special Operations Executive (SOE). Arrested but released on several occasions, she made a dramatic escape from Copenhagen's Gestapo headquarters in August 1944. Early life Born in Copenhagen on 28 September 1911, Edith Andersen was the daughter of the senior civil servant Edmund Christian Sofus Andersen (1886–1962) and Carla Vilhelmine Fliedner (1890–1928). She and her sister were brought up in a well-to-do home where they were taught to respect king and country. After completing realskole at Aurehøj Gymnasium in 1928, she trained to become an office worker. From 1930 until her marriage with Poul Winther Bonnesen in 1935, she worked for the London insurance company. Her marriage was dissolved in 1940. Resistance work Bonnesen had already experienced the Nazis' racial policy when in 1935 she and her husband helped a Jewish couple in Denmark. In 1937, while visiting Berlin, she experienced first hand the way Jews were being treated. As a result, she became firmly opposed to the Nazis and became interested in participating in illegal activities. After her divorce in 1940, Bonnesen was employed in the Ministry of Transport's department for monitoring private railways. Here she had access to confidential German reports which she communicated anonymously to her friends in order to protest against the German occupation. In early 1942, a friend brought her in touch with De frie Danske (Free Denmark), a resistance group which published an illegal paper with the same name. In addition to contributing to the paper, she became involved in producing ration cards and false identity documents. Her apartment on Tranegårdsvej in Hellerup was often used as a meeting place for resistance workers or for hiding wanted persons, including Mogens Hammer, the first SOE agent parachuted in Denmark. In connection with involvement in De frie Danske and the SOE, she was arrested three times by the Danish and German police in late 1942 but was released after denying any involvement in illegal work. After the Germans took over the government of Denmark in August 1943, she had to go underground. She continued her illegal work with the radio specialist L.A. Duus Hansen who transmitted coded information to the SOE. Using the code name Lotte, she became his personal secretary. In August 1944, while visiting the Danish-Swedish Refugee Service's illegal post office in central Copenhagen, she was arrested and taken to the Gestapo headquarters in the Shell House. While being interrogated, a senior officer came in and ordered her to be taken to the basement as there was sufficient evidence against her. She was in fact taken by a guard to a large room on the second floor. The guard went into a back room where he started talking to another German. Left alone, she decided to try to escape. She walked down the stairs to the first floor where she met two civilian Germans who were leaving the building. She walked behind them and out of the front door where the guard failed to recognize her. After walking calmly across the bridge to the Palace Theatre, she ran off as fast as she could. Now that she had been identified, she had to leave Denmark for neutral Sweden where she was employed as a secretary at the American consulate in Helsingborg. Unofficially, she operated a radio, receiving messages from Denmark and passing them on to London. After the American consul was called back to the United States at the beginning of 1945, Bonnesen acted as consul until the Liberation. She then returned to Copenhagen where she worked with the Special Forces Mission until the autumn of 1945. Post-war activity In 1946, Bonnesen was employed by the textile firm Fiedlers Kattuntryk where she later headed the export department. In 1952, she had to leave as her hearing was seriously impaired as a result of an injury from a shooting incident during the German occupation. After learning to lip-read, she was employed as a secretary and later as an official by the Defence Department until her retirement in 1975. Edith Bonnesen died in Copenhagen on 20 February 1992. Awards She was awarded the King's Medal for Courage in the Cause of Freedom for her participation in the resistance movement.

They met in the city of Košice, which had already been liberated by the Red Army. The program outlined the postwar political settlement, the National Front under which all political parties would operate, and promised the expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia. The program was the basis of both the Third Czechoslovak Republic and, following the 1948 coup, the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. The program document was approved on 5 April 1945. It set out the principles of future policy and was referred to as the \\"program of national and democratic revolution\\". It shifted the orientation of Czechoslovakia further towards the USSR and \\"legally\\" anchored dependence on the USSR. It declared claims about the collective guilt of right-wing parties and the German and Hungarian populations for the breakup of Czechoslovakia and for cooperation with the Nazi regime. The draft text was prepared by the Czechoslovak Communist Party (KSČ). Preparation In the final stages of World War II, negotiations were held between President Edvard Beneš and the Moscow leadership of the Communist Party, led by Klement Gottwald, about forming a postwar government. As a result a government of the National Front of Czechs and Slovaks was established on 4 April 1945 with the Social Democratic Party chairman Zdeněk Fierlinger as the prime minister. Officially, it was reported that the government approved the so-called Košice government program after arriving in Košice on 5 April 1945. In fact, the government program was signed on March 29 in Moscow. The parties of the London exile arrived at the Moscow meeting insufficiently prepared. Besides the Communists, only the Social Democrats submitted a proposal, which was rejected by Fierlinger (a fellow traveler of Communism who supported the coup). Structure The program consisted of 16 chapters dealing with various issues of social, political, and economic life, and of the international status of the liberated Czechoslovakia. The main features of the program are: * Establishing a regime of limited democracy, euphemistically called \\"people's democracy\\" * Abandonment of Czechoslovakism; recognition of Slovak self governance and of the Slovak National Council as its representative; accepting the relationship of Czechs and Slovaks on an equal footing * A new political system based on the National Front as a broad coalition for all permitted political directions, thus excluding the opposition (the most important element was banning the Agrarian Party) * Restrictions on private ownership, nationalization of large companies, and other socialist reforms * Denaturalization of German and Hungarian nationals living in Czechoslovakia (with legislative exceptions) * One-sided orientation towards the Soviet Union in foreign, security and defense policy * Formation of the Czechoslovak Army on the Red Army principles, introducing \\"propaganda officers\\".

It is in the Ministry of Natural Resources' Nipigon District of the Northwest Region. There are no visitor facilities and camping is not allowed. The park may be used during the day for canoeing, fishing, walking, nature appreciation and wildlife viewing. Environment The park is well-forested, and protects the land around the mouth of the slow-moving river, which meanders through the sands of its bird's foot deltaic fan. This is one of a small number of active deltas of this type in the Canadian Great Lakes. The park is in the boreal forest ecosystem. Controlled burning may be used as a substitute for natural forest fires, which are necessary for maintenance and renewal of the vegetation. The peninsula is visited by many seasonally migrating waterfowl, and is used for nesting by shore birds. There is a nesting colony of great blue heron (Ardea herodias). Animal species include white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), moose (Alces alces), snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus) and Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis). Lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) are thought to spawn in the lower Gravel River, and northern brook lamprey (Ichthyomyzon fossor) have been found in the river.

Climo was born in Longford, the son of Colonel William Hill Climo (1838−1919) of the Army Medical Service and his wife Margaret (1843/4−1922).Biography, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography He was educated at Shrewsbury School and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst and in February 1888 was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 2nd Battalion, Border Regiment. In July 1889, while serving with the 1st Battalion in India, he was promoted lieutenant, and two months later transferred to the Indian Army and joined the 24th Punjabis, which became the 4th Battalion, 14th Punjab Regiment in 1922.Obituary, The Times, 1 April 1937 In 1897−1898, Climo served with the battalion at the siege of Malakand and the relief of Chakdara and the subsequent operations during the Mohmand campaign on the North-West Frontier. For these operations, he was mentioned in despatches, awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) in May 1898, which was awarded personally by Queen Victoria on 17 November 1898,\\"Court Circular\\", The Times, 18 November 1898 and in February 1899 promoted captain and brevet major. In 1900, Climo accompanied his battalion to China to help put down the Boxer Rebellion, and fought at the relief of Peking and the battles of Peitsang and Yangtsun, being again mentioned in despatches in January 1901. He was second-in-command of his battalion during the British expedition to Tibet in 1903−1904 and in February 1905 was promoted to the substantive rank of major. In 1908, he served in the Mohmand expedition on the North-West Frontier and in the engagement at Kargha in May, and was mentioned in despatches for a third time in June 1908. On 22 June 1911, he was one of the Indian Army officers selected to represent the force at the coronation of King George V.\\"British Officers from India\\", The Times, 13 March 1911 In February 1912, he was promoted lieutenant-colonel and took command of the 24th Punjabis. At the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, the battalion was posted to Egypt with Indian Expeditionary Force F to help defend the Suez Canal, and in 1915 was sent to Mesopotamia, where it fought at the Battle of Shaiba on 12–14 April. At the end of May, Climo was given temporary command of the 17th Indian Brigade and led the main assault in the so-called \\"regatta\\", in which a fleet of small boats was used to advance up the Tigris and capture Amarah. He then commanded his battalion at the battle of Nasiriyah in June−July 1915, and commanded the 30th Indian Brigade at the Battle of Kut al Amara in September 1915 and the Battle of Ctesiphon in November 1915, where he was severely wounded on 22 November while commanding the brigade in the successful assault on the \\"Vital Point\\" redoubt, being hit twice in the leg and then again as he was being evacuated on a stretcher. He was promoted to brevet colonel in October 1915, again mentioned in despatches in January 1916 appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in June 1916, He was also awarded the Order of the Nile 3rd class by the Sultan of Egypt in November 1916. After recovering from his wounds, Climo served as a temporary brigadier-general and brigade commander from January to April 1916, commanded the Nowshera Brigade in India, again as temporary brigadier-general, from May 1917 and was promoted major-general in June 1918. In 1919, he commanded the 3rd Indian Brigade during the Third Anglo-Afghan War. In May 1919, he was given command of the Waziristan Force, which successfully subdued the Tochi Wazirs. For this, he was once again mentioned in despatches in December 1920 and appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) on 1 August 1920. General Sir Charles Monro, the Commander-in-Chief, India, wrote of him: \\"Major-General S. H. Climo, C.B., D.S.O., commanded the Waziristan Field Force to my entire satisfaction. In every theatre of war in which he has been employed he has proved himself to be an exceptionally able and resolute commander, and especially so in this arduous campaign, which has demanded the highest qualities of leadership. His knowledge of frontier warfare and the best means of dealing satisfactorily with the complex problems created thereby has been most marked. His extensive acquaintance of administrative detail enabled him to provide successfully for the comfort and health of his troops. This was especially noticeable on the Lines of Communication, where the provision of Rest Camps, wherein the sick were attended to and relieving troops provided with ample food and shelter, largely contributed to the efficiency of the Force and the success of the operation.\\" He then held the temporary rank of lieutenant-general while retaining command of the Waziristan Force until May 1920 and was appointed general officer commanding (GOC) Poona District in June 1920. He was promoted to the substantive rank of lieutenant- general in June 1921, but was placed on the unemployed list in December 1922, returning to Britain and settling in Folkestone.

They were active during the Napoleonic Wars and were part of the British Volunteer Corps.  History  = 1794–1802 = Raised in 1794 in response to the Volunteer Act 1794, the Leeds Volunteer Corps served for 'the express purpose of the Internal Defence of this Borough against Insurrection or any sudden commotion'. The creation of a volunteer force for Leeds was first considered at a meeting in Leeds on 17 April and, after agreeing to create the Leeds Volunteer Corps, a subscription was created at this meeting to which around 100 men enrolled to serve. Thomas Lloyd, a cloth merchant from Leeds, was chosen to command the volunteer force.Morris, Patricia. (1983). Leeds and the Amateur Military Tradition. PhD. University of Leeds. At the meeting, a list of subscribes was drawn up, which totalled almost 200 men. This list also showed the donations made by each man to the Corps, many of which were of £100. By the end of April 1794, there were 200 volunteers. The Leeds Volunteer Corps would meet every morning and evening to practise military exercise. Their first public appearance was on 4 June 1794 for King George III of the United Kingdom's birthday, where they assembled in White Cloth Hall then marched through the town. The volunteers also organised a church parade in 1794 which was watched by thousands of spectators.Kevin Linch, ‘The Volunteer Forces of the West Riding of Yorkshire during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, 1793–1814’ (unpublished MA by research, University of Leeds, 1998) Once the Leeds Volunteer Corps reached a subscription base of 300 men in August 1794, the Mayor of Leeds Alexander Turner asked for Thomas Lloyd to be promoted from Commandant to Lieutenant Colonel. This was approved in early September of the same year. On 29 August 1794 the Leeds Volunteer Corps attended a ceremony where they were presented with Colours by the Ladies of Leeds. Over the year, some attempt was made to raise a cavalry to be attached to the Leeds Volunteer Corps. However, this was unsuccessful. On 26 May 1795, the Leeds Volunteer Corps organised a military festival – 'A Great Military Festival: A Grand Volunteer Review' to celebrate the volunteers and others involved in the war against France. This was potentially the greatest event of civic militarism outside of London during the era of the British Volunteer Corps. The Volunteer Corps of Leeds, Bradford, Huddersfield, Halifax and Wakefield participated and the event attracted over 60,000 spectators, according to the Leeds Intelligencer. On 18 September of the same year, Lieutenant Colonel Lloyd hosted a dinner for the Leeds Volunteer Corps at his mansion. In November, the Leeds Volunteer Corps agreed to present a letter to King George III of the United Kingdom to congratulate him on surviving an assassination attempt on his life. The final activity of 1795 for the Leeds Volunteers Corps was on 30 December where they were inspected by Prince William, Duke of Gloucester on Chapeltown Moor. They were found to be to his satisfaction. On 13 February 1796, the Leeds Volunteer Corps assisted in the taming of a fire at a linen factory on Water Lane, where 8 people died and 20 were injured. The Leeds Volunteer Corps were once again reviewed on 4 August during the Great Review of Volunteers by Lieutenant General Scott and were once again found to be satisfactory. The final act of the Leeds Volunteer Corps in 1796 was the changing of their service terms, after the Wakefield Volunteer Corps did the same, to: > Great Britain: To any part of Great Britain under Acts of 43, 3, 96 and 121 The Leeds Volunteer Corps were once again called upon on 11 August 1799 to aid against a fire at a wool mill at Bean Ing belonging to Messrs Wormald, Fountain and Gott. Later, in October the same year, the Leeds Volunteer Corps also participated in a general field day. The final inspection of the Leeds Volunteer Corps took place on Woodhouse Moor by General Stavely. Again, they were found to be satisfactory. The Leeds Volunteer Corps were disbanded in 1802, primarily due to the signing of the Treaty of Amiens on 25 March 1802. Only six men were listed as having 'gone for a soldier' or 'into the army' Before the disbandment though, a great celebration – with balls, dinners and concerts – took place on 1 June to celebrate the peace of the Treaty of Amiens. During the first era of the Leeds Volunteer Corps, the average attendance of members was 5.5%. = 1803–1808 = In September 1803, with the increasing threat of French invasion during the Napoleonic Wars, the Leeds Volunteer Corps were reassembled. A meeting was held on 5 July 1803, in White Cloth Hall Yard, to discuss the possibility of the reformation of the Leeds Volunteer Corps. This was then proposed to His Majesty, who accepted the proposed unit on 8 September 1803. The reformed Leeds Volunteer Corps were to serve 'Great Britain', as before. At first, enrolment numbers were low, with only about 600 men entering. Yet, returns on 22 October 1803 showed the Leeds Volunteer Corps to be composed of two battalions, which totalled 1400 men. This was thanks to an article in the Leeds Mercury which boosted membership within a week or two, and also helped raise nearly £16,000 in subscriptions. The Ladies of Leeds entered a subscription to pay for each volunteer to have a flannel waistcoat. The Leeds Volunteers were ordered not to be absent for more than 48 hours during this period, as the local and national fear of invasion by Napoleon I. Plans were also made to give the Leeds Volunteer Corps the ability to rush to London in wagons if they were needed to fight in an invasion. From 26 September 1803 the Leeds Volunteers were to complete 20 days of training over 5 weeks. The first major event for the Leeds Volunteer Corps took place on 22 October, which was observed of a Day of Fast. All attended a divine service in the morning, followed by an afternoon inspection by Lieutenant-Colonel Garden. In November the Leeds Volunteer Corps received orders to be ready to march on the shortest notice, indicating a sense of danger within the army command. In this case, the North Battalion was to assemble in Briggate and the South Battalion to assemble on Boar Lane. At the start of 1804, the Leeds Volunteer Corps received their new uniforms. Another inspection took place soon after this by General Lee, who found the volunteer's firing to be performed in \\"excellent time\\". On 8 March the Colours were presented to Colonel Lloyd by the Mayoress during a celebratory service. The next day volunteers were once again inspected in Mixed Cloth Hall as a response to the Governments decision to place a number of volunteers on permanent duty. In April 1804, the Leeds Volunteer Corps were put on 3 weeks of active duty. They marched to York from 6 to 8 April, after having the Articles of War read to them in Cloth Hall Yard. Most of this time was spent marching into the country and practising military exercises. The volunteers returned to much praise and celebration, including a speech given by the recorded praising all the men on their exertions. Subscribers to the Leeds Volunteer Corps were called upon, on 15 May, with a letter stating: > The Subscribes to the Volunteer Corps for the Borough and Parish of Leeds, > are requested to pay a further sum of 25 per Cent, upon their respective > Subscriptions, into the Bank of Messrs. As usual, the Leeds Volunteer Corps assembled to celebrate His Majesty's birthday on 4 June. The final activity of the year was when the Leeds Volunteer Corps were summoned to help fight a fire at Benjamin Gatts mill in Armley in November. A request was made to resupply the Leeds Volunteer Corps with Prussian Muskets on 17 January 1805, stating that every musket they currently had needed replacing.Home Office, HO50/147 (Frank to Hawkesbury, 1805) This requested was granted and the Leeds Volunteer Corps were provided with new Prussian Muskets. The Leeds Volunteer Corps once again returned to active duty in October 1805, and again returned to high praise from the townsfolk of Leeds. The volunteers work on duty consisted of prepping for a review and inspection by Brigadier-General Hodgson, from which they passed with flying colours. The Mayor of Doncaster gave a ball and supper to the officers, corporations and neighbouring gentry of the Leeds Volunteer Corps as a show of respect. On 20 November the Armley cloth mill owned by Benjamin Gott was destroyed by fire but, thanks to the efforts of the Leeds Volunteers, this fie did not spread to the corn mill and other adjacent premises. Following the success at the Battle of Trafalgar, the threat of French invasion was lessened and the Government began to make changes to the British Volunteer Corps. The Levy-En-Masse Act 1806 was an attempt by the British Government to destroy the volunteer force through regulatory changes. In August 1806 there were several meetings held to determine the future of the Leeds Volunteer Corps, of all which decided to continue the service of the volunteers. Yet, during a return in the same year, the Leeds Volunteer Corps were missing 774 men from 1400 previously enrolled. On 31 January 1807 the Mercury announced that Colonel Lloyd has resigned command of the Leeds Volunteer Corps. He received much praise and expressed regret both from the volunteers and the general townsfolk following his departure. He received a gold snuff box from the non- commissioned officers and privates of the Leeds Volunteer Corps as a token of their thanks. After this the efficiency and spirit of the Leeds Volunteer Corps was lost, starting off their demise. Yet they continued service for another year, with a two-week active duty period commencing on 30 September. During this time some of the men became involved in a disturbance of sorts, resulting in the Adjutant of the South Battalion Captain Jackson having his arm broken. Due to this injury, the officers of the Volunteer Infantry rewarded him with a sword valuing fifty guineas the following year, as well as a subscribed sword from the non-commissioned officers, drummers and privates of the South Battalion on 10 December 1807. In 1808, Petitions for Peace became general and one was sent from Leeds on 5 March with over 28,000 names. The Levy-En-Masse Act of 1806 was succeeded by the Local Militia Bill 1808, which also aimed to remove the British Volunteer Corps and replacing them with a Local Militia. After the passing of the bill, around 800 volunteers assembled in Cloth Hall to have it read and explained to them. Around 200 men left for the Militia that day, and another 140 left around a week later. Of these men, 177 men and 94 officers and staff belonged to the North Battalion alone. Thus the Leeds Volunteer Corps slowly ceased to exist. Organisation The Leeds Volunteer Corps was composed of two battalions, divided into the North Battalion and South Battalion. It is debated as to why this was the case. One argument is that the divide was due to political alliance. The Leeds Volunteers were apparently split into Lloyd's Tory-Anglican corporation and Whig-Liberal dissenting officers. The party was a distinctive feature of the corps with only the threat of invasion overcoming the party divide. The other argument was instead that religion caused the split into two battalions. Supposedly, one battalion was supporting the Anglican corporation. The other battalion was the opposition to this, composed of Unitarian supporters.  Uniform  The uniform of the Leeds Volunteer Corps changed several times over their service periods. Initially, the Leeds Intelligencer reported in early May 1794 that the Leeds Volunteer Corps uniform was to be blue faced with scarlet, with cape and cuffs of the latter colour, a mottoed button, and white waistcoat and breeches. Two weeks later, the Leeds Intelligencer reported that the Leeds Volunteer Corps uniform had changed. The new uniform of the volunteers was to be scarlet faced with blue, and a mottoed button. The facings uniform was reported to be of a bright blue. The coat was described as having buttons in pairs, with 4 pairs on the lapels as well as buttons at the side of each collar and on the cuffs. Later the same year, the Leeds Volunteer Corps were presented with their colours. These colours were the Union Flag and the Leeds Coat of Arms with the motto \\"Pro Rege et Patria\\". The uniform of the Leeds Volunteer Corps was once again altered upon their re-establishment in 1803. The uniform was scarlet faced with yellow. On a Field Officer's uniform there are 5 pairs of buttons running down each breast, but no buttons on the cuffs. These buttons are flat, with the initials \\"LV\\" engraved on, as was the case in the previous uniforms. The uniform of other ranks was still scarlet faced with yellow as well as white breeches with black gaiters, caps with a white feather for battalion companies, and a green feather for “flank” companies. A field officer's coat of this design is displayed in Leeds City Museum. The volunteers received these new uniforms early the following year. The Leeds Volunteer Corps were again presented with their colours in March. In October 1805, the uniform's feathers were replaced with tufts for all ranks. Upon the disbandment of Leeds Volunteer Corps in 1808 the remaining uniforms were sold at auction.  Demographics  The men of the Leeds Volunteer Corps could be split demographically by their occupation or residence. All stated percentages are based on less than 200 of the pre-1803 Leeds Volunteers Corps. By occupation, the following divides are seen: 33.16% gentlemen; 22.45% retailer; 14.8% artisan-high; 11.73% artisan-low; 6.2% employers; 5.61% professionals; 5.1% artisan-low and 1.02% labourers. By residence in Leeds, the following divides are seen: 44.75% town; 20.44% Kirkgate; 9.94% Mill Hill and West; 6.08% North West; 5.52% South; 5.52% East; 4.42% Outer Towns and 3.31% North East. It can be observed that the majority of the men in the Leeds Volunteer Corps were wealthy gentlemen, which is not out of character for the time. A minority of men belonged to the labourer or artisan-low category. It is also known that none of the men were below 5'9\\" in height, with some of the volunteers being reported to be above 6 foot.  Awards  = Vote of thanks = The Leeds Volunteer Corps received two votes of thanks from the corporation during their service. The first was passed on 29 September for 'their readiness in enrolling themselves for its defence' and resulted in Lieutenant Colonel Lloyd being presented with an £84 sword, which would cost almost £11,000 in 2018 value. The second vote of thanks was passed on 5 May 1802, after the reestablishment of the Leeds Volunteer Corps. The volunteers were rewarded with a dinner at the corporation's expense. = Awards given to Lieutenant Colonel Lloyd = On 17 June 1796, the non-commissioned officers and privates presented Lloyd with a 'mark of attachment' as a silver cup valued at 160 guineas. In late 1801 the officers, men and non-commissioned officers of the Leeds Volunteer Corps commissioned a portrait of Lieutenant Colonel Lloyd as 'a present to the Colonel's Lady’. After the final disbandment of the Leeds Volunteer Corps, Lieutenant Colonel Lloyd was presented with a gold snuff box 'as a mark of respect and approbation'.Navickas, Katrina, \\"The 'Spirit Of Loyalty': Material Culture, Space And The Construction Of An English Loyalist Memory, 1790–1840\\", in Loyalism And The Formation Of The British World, 1775–1914, 1st edn (Woodbridge: The Boydell Press, 2014), pp. 43–60  Notable volunteers  = Thomas Lloyd = Thomas Lloyd was the Lieutenant Colonel of the Leeds Volunteer Corps from its outset to conclusion.

In 2019, he was profiled by The New York Times as one of the new guards of Nigerian music. He is widely known for his controversial self-proclaimed status as the \\"Best Rapper in Africa\\" (abbreviated as \\"BRIA\\"), which became the most talked about topic in the Nigerian hip hop space between July and September 2019.  Early life and career Emeka was born on 29 January 1996, to an Igbo family and grew up, exposed to the Yoruba and Urhobo culture in Nigeria. He was 13 years old when he discovered he could rap, and his journey into music was a result of happenstance. He self-discovered his talent while listening to the radio with his cousin, when the song of a 12 year old rapper was played. His cousin liked the song and challenged Blaqbonez to come up with his own lyrics, since he liked criticizing rappers. Few minutes later, he had enough bars for a verse, and that was where it all began. His parents were not in support of his new found hobby, and he secretly pursued his passion. While in school, he dropped his first project, Hip-Hop in Blaq, and participated in competitions. Blaqbonez started exploring his rap skills very early, and at 16, came 1st out of over 3000 rappers in Nigeria, who participated in Terry tha Rapman's Zombie competition. As a result, he and was featured on Terry's album World Domination alongside Olamide, Vector (rapper), Mode 9, Spellz which was released in 2012. Five years later, Blaqbonez featured Terry on one of his projects. He emerged 1st runner-up in Vector (rapper)’s king kong competition, won the Rhythm fm Freestyle Fury and became RhythmFm’s artiste of the month, became the Hennessy Vs class captain, part of the Soundcity blast cypher, also released his much talked about mixtape CTAT \\"Cssette Tapes and Tvs\\" grossing over 60,000 engagements in streams and downloads, which is his third mixtape, following hip-hop in blaq and the \\"unfinished EP\\". In an interview with The Punch newspaper, he said his \\"Best Rapper in Africa\\" proclamation was a response to a diss track and need to wake up other rappers in Nigeria. He was recently described by The Guardian as 'carrying the torch of Nigerian rap' and on 2 January 2019, he was listed by the same publication as one of the \\"Top 10 Artists to watch in 2019\\". Blaqbonez has released 8 EPs and a mixtape. =2018: Bad Boy Blaq = Blaqbonez released his eighth EP Bad Boy Blaq on 31 August 2018. It was released as part of the L.A.M.B project, a series of three hip hop albums that attempts to reawaken Nigerian hip hop. Bad Boy Blaq was executively produced by M.I Abaga and released through 100 Crowns, a label imprint of Chocolate City. The EP was the last of three releases and was preceded by M.I Abaga's A Study on Self Worth: Yxng Dxnzl (2018). A reissue of the EP, titled Bad Bloy Blaq Re-Up, was released in February 2019. =2019: Mr. Boombastic = Blaqbonez released his ninth EP Mr. Boombastic on 25 October 2019. A day before the release of the EP, Blaqbonez released the promotional single \\"Jesus Is Black (Letter to Kanye West)\\". In it, he tells Kanye West to postponed the release of his ninth studio album Jesus Is King, which had the same release date as Mr. Boombastic. In 2020, Blaqbonez dropped a new song 'Haba'.

History =Origins= Several women's football teams associated or affiliated to Southampton F.C. have played in at least the last 50 years. In 1970, Southampton Women's FC was formed by female fans of the men's team. Another team, Southampton Saints Girls & Ladies F.C. were also formed, in 1979 (initially as Red Star FC). Saints Girls & Ladies were founder members of the FA Women's Premier League in 1991, and absorbed by Southampton FC in 2001. Later in 2005, with the club in financial difficulties and men's senior side relegated from the Premier League after 27 years of top-flight football, Southampton F.C. withdrew support for the female side. Southampton Saints Girls & Ladies continued without major club support for another 14 years, before announcing their demise due to financial difficulties in July 2019 =Revival= By 2016 Southampton FC, under new ownership, had realised the need for a competitive senior women's team as the profile of women's football in the UK grew. A senior women's team formally affiliated to Southampton F.C. was formed. In May 2017 an Under-21 side was formed. In March 2018, Southampton unsuccessfully applied to enter the FA Women's Championship (Tier 2). The club intend to reapply. In May 2018 the club was promoted from the Southern Region Women's Football League Division One as champions. In July 2018, the club appointed former senior England international Marieanne Spacey- Cale, MBE as Head of Women's And Girls' Football. Spacey-Cale has 91 senior England caps. In May 2019 the club won the Southern Region Women's Football League (Premier Division), with a perfect win of 18 wins, their second successive league title, earning promotion to the FA Women's National League (Division One).

Hertwig is Director of the Center for Adaptive Rationality at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin, Germany. He grew up with his brothers Steffen Hertwig and Michael Hertwig (parents Walter and Inge Hertwig) in Talheim, Heilbronn. Academic career Hertwig received his Ph.D. in Psychology from the University of Konstanz, Germany, in 1995. In the same year, he joined Gerd Gigerenzer’s research group at the Max Planck Institute for Psychological Research in Munich; in 1997, the group moved to the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin. In 2000, Hertwig received a fellowship from the German Research Foundation, which supported his research at Columbia University for three years. Hertwig obtained his Habilitation qualification from the Free University of Berlin in 2003, and in the same year became Assistant Professor for Applied Cognitive Science at the University of Basel, Switzerland. In 2005, he was appointed Full Professor of Cognitive and Decision Sciences. In 2012, Hertwig was appointed Director of the Center for Adaptive Rationality at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin. Research =Bounded rationality= Hertwig has been a key contributor to the study of bounded rationality, or how people search for information and make decisions with limited resources. His work investigates how decision making can be modeled in terms of fast and frugal heuristics—simple cognitive strategies that use little information and rely on just a few processing steps. Hertwig has examined, for instance, heuristics for making inferences (e.g., fluency heuristic), choices (e.g., priority heuristic, natural mean heuristic), parental allocation decisions (e.g., equity heuristic), and medical decisions (e.g., first impression heuristic). The rationality of a heuristic depends on whether it matches the structure of the environment in which it is applied. The notion of ecological, rather than logical, rationality challenges a core premise of the heuristics-and-biases program, namely, that intelligent processes must conform with the formal principles of logic, probability theory, and rational choice theory, irrespective of the decision context. Hertwig does not uncritically accept these domain-general standards; rather, he asks which other context-specific concerns may be at play when such principles are violated. In his Ph.D. dissertation, he showed that the conjunction fallacy, a seemingly logical error often illustrated by the Linda problem, reflects people’s capacity to infer the meaning of polysemous terms like probability.Hertwig, R. (1995). Why Dr Gould’s Homunculus doesn’t think like Dr Gould: The “conjunction fallacy” reconsidered, Doctoral dissertation, Universität Konstanz: Germany. Konstanz: Hartung-Gorre Verlag. Another reason why fast and frugal heuristics can yield good decisions is that they take advantage of evolved cognitive capacities of the human mind. Together with Lael Schooler, Hertwig has shown that ecologically smart forgetting—the capacity to forget information that is unlikely to be needed—fosters the use of heuristics that rely on partial ignorance (e.g., recognition heuristic, fluency heuristic). =Learning about risks via description or experience= People can learn about the potential consequences of their decisions and the associated probabilities in two ways: by reading summaries of probability information (e.g., drug-package inserts) or by personally experiencing the consequences of their decisions, one at a time (e.g., going out on dates). Using monetary lotteries to compare these two learning modes, Hertwig and colleagues observed a “description-experience gap,” a phenomenon by which rare events are given too much weight in decisions from description and too little weight in decisions from experience. This occurs partly because decisions from experience are based on small samples, where people are simply less likely to experience the rare event. The description–experience gap has been observed across thousands of choices and found to generalize beyond monetary gambles to domains including causal reasoning, intertemporal choice, consumer choice, investment decisions, medical decisions, and adolescent risk taking. =Deliberate ignorance= People often deliberately choose not to know. For example, up to 55% of those who get tested for HIV do not return to pick up their results. The conscious choice not to seek or use information has been called deliberate ignorance. In a theoretical article, Hertwig and Christoph Engel argued that deliberate ignorance is not necessarily an anomaly but can serve important functions. One such function is to act as an emotion-regulation device: people may avoid potentially threatening health information because it compromises cherished beliefs, they anticipate mental discomfort, or they want to keep hope alive. Hertwig and Engel are also co-editors of an interdisciplinary book exploring manifestations of deliberate ignorance from the right not to know in genetic testing to collective amnesia in transformational societies; from blinding in orchestral auditions to “don’t ask, don’t tell” policies in the military and beyond; and from efforts to prevent algorithms feeding on discriminatory data to the strategic lack of funding for research into gun violence.Hertwig, R., & Engel, C. (Eds.) (in press). Deliberate ignorance: Choosing not to know. Strüngmann Forum Reports. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. =Boosting= To date, most public policy interventions informed by behavioral science evidence involve “nudges”; that is, non-fiscal and non-regulatory interventions that steer (nudge) people in a specific direction while preserving freedom of choice.Thaler, R., & Sunstein, C. R. (2008). Nudge: Improving decisions about health, wealth and happiness. New York, NY: Simon & Schuster. Hertwig’s work has focused on “boosts,” an alternative class of non-fiscal and non-regulatory policy interventions grounded in behavioral science. Boosts aim to improve people’s decisional, cognitive, and motivational competences, making it easier for them to exercise their own agency. Instead of simply providing information, boosts offer a simple and sustainable strategy for successfully dealing with a given task. For instance, a boost with proven effectiveness in improving the quality of relationships is to imagine oneself as a third-party spectator when involved in a quarrel, and to mentally engage with this perspective-shifting strategy through quick writing exercises. In an article written in collaboration with Till Grüne-Yanoff, Hertwig examined how boosts differ from nudges in terms of the psychological mechanisms through which they operate, as well as their normative implications for transparency and autonomy. For instance, while nudges can skirt conscious deliberation and therefore risk being manipulative, boosts require the individual’s active cooperation, and thus need to be explicit and transparent. Other important publications by Hertwig tackle questions such as when boosts are more appropriate than nudges, how to boost nutritional health, how statistical information can best be communicated to improve risk literacy, and how collective intelligence can be harnessed to boost medical diagnostic decisions.

(1853- 30 December 1932) was a Welsh landscape painter and illustrator, particularly active in North Wales. Working principally in watercolour, Jones made numerous studies and paintings of the fields near Caernarfon and the Conway Valley. Many of these rural studies have an idealised, pastoral, character suggestive of the English picturesque and Romantic landscape traditions originating in the works of John Constable and developed by J.M.W Turner.  Early life  Samuel Maurice Jones was born in Mochdre, a coastal village in north-east Wales near Colwyn Bay. His father, Rev. John Jones, was a Calvinistic Methodist minister. Jones was trained first at the Caernarfon School of Art under the tutelage of John Cambrian Rowland and later, in London where he studied under William Collingwood between 1870-73. Collingwood was an Associate of the Society of Painters in Watercolours and offered Jones a thorough and traditional training in the fundamentals of arts education; schooling him in the importance of line and composition, shading, drawing carefully from nature and drawing from memory.See Jones notebook and study journal completed while under the tuition of Colinwood, 1870-3, part of the bequest at the National Library of Wales. The first entry in the study book detailing his lesson with Collingwood on Monday 11 April 1870, recalls his teachers' words: 'You must regard your hand as an instrument requiring to be taught how to execute with certainty and freedom, every mental command.'See Jones' study book of this period, 1870-3 in the Samuel Maurice Jones Papers, 1866-39, 'Artist Notebook', [p.1]. While he was in London, Jones met two figures closely associated with the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood: the art critic, John Ruskin, and the painter, Holman Hunt, who reviewed and offered constructive criticism of his work. Shortly afterwards Jones returned to Caernarfon in order to pursue his career as an artist.  Early work  alt=Jones' early sketchbooks attest to the influence of the British Romantic painters, particularly J.M.W. Turner. A small, leather-bound copy book and sketchbook dated 1874 by Jones, includes a copy of Turner's painting Crossing the Brook, exhibited in the National Gallery in 1815. An inscription later in the small notebook reads: The Crossing the Brook is one of those pictures of Turner's which every one admires... The view is taken from the banks of Tamar, that divides Devonshire from Cornwall. It is possible that the first study in the 1874 notebook, a gothic ink study of Caernarfon Castle by moonlight, is modeled on Turner's painting of Caernarfon Castle c. 1798, though Jones may well have brought his first-hand knowledge of the castle to bear on this study. Pencil drawing from one of Jones' sketchbooks, ca 1890, NLW.In addition to Turner, the sketchbook contains copies of works by Claude and Richard Wilson, an influential Welsh landscape painter and founding member of the Royal Academy. The notebook also includes copied-out sections from the fourth and fifth volumes of John Ruskin's Modern Painters, a standard textbook for art students of that period, which inspired the Pre-Raphaelite painters John Everett Millais and Holman Hunt. Though the 1974 notebook contains a number of street scenes and impressionistic figure and portrait studies, it is evident that from the time of his artistic training onwards, Jones' primary interest lay in depicting landscapes. The notebook of his lessons under Collingwood between 1870-1873 report that Jones was encouraged to go on frequent sketching trips back home in Wales, including to Betws-y-Coed, drawing directly from nature. Jones continued this practice of drawing en plein aire after his return from London, as his sketchbooks of the 1880s and 1890s suggest.  Later work  alt= Jones' watercolours of the 1880s depict conventional rural scenes featuring quaint cottages, deserted castles, shaded country lanes and rivers, and often, single, solitary figures, passing through or at work in the landscape. Such visions of country life are consistent with fashions in late Victorian landscape painting as exemplified by the works of Henry John Kinnaird, and the women artists Kate Greenaway and Helen Allingham. However, as paintings of Caernarfon street life, such as Hole in the Wall, and the carefully described exterior walls of Tan y Castell (c.1880) suggest, Jones also had a keen interest in urban architecture, engineering and building design.  Marriage  Samuel Maurice Jones married Jane Jones on 14 December 1892 in a Calvinistic Methodist ceremony. According to the marriage certificate, the wedding was conducted at the Moriah chapel in Caernarfon and the artist was forty years old and his wife thirty-four, at the time of marriage. Marriage certificate contained in a file of papers donated to the National Library Wales by the donor's father. File 1.  Further interests  Samuel Maurice Jones was a fluent Welsh language speaker. Though many of Jones' early private notebooks and sketchbooks dating to the period of his artistic training in London (c.1870) are written in English, most of his writings dating to later periods in his life, from the 1880s onwards, are written in Welsh. This growing interest in the Welsh language is reflected by Jones' wider interests. Jones contributed articles and illustrations to the Welsh-focused literary publication Cymru ('Wales') edited by Owen M. Edwards. He also designed the front cover of this Welsh serial.See cutting from a Carnarvon-based newspaper published on 14 August 1891, file 2 of NLW bequest. In addition to publications, Maurice wrote lectures and public addresses on art and Welsh-interest topics, including on famous Welsh historic personages at the Liverpool Welsh National Society on Friday 9th 1925.See a pamphlet for this address collected in the Samuel Maurice Jones Papers, 1866-1939, File 3, National Library of Wales  Awards and recognition  Though Jones did not attract considerable critical interest in his lifetime, he did meet with moderate professional success. His works were exhibited in London, Liverpool, Southport and Manchester. See an obituary pasted in part of a bequest donated to the National Library of Wales by the artist's father, file 1, Samuel Maurice Jones Papers, 1866-1939. He was also a founding member of the Royal Cambrian Academy in Conway, where he exhibited annually. In 1882 Jones was elected as an Associate Member of the Royal Cambrian Academy and elected as a full member in 1921, eleven years before his death. The artist died in Llandudno 30 December 1932.

Early life  Florence Collins was born August 14, 1853, in Caribou, Maine, the daughter of Samuel W. Collins and Dorcas Hardison Collins. Her parents ran the town's general store.  Education and journalism  Porter was the first woman to serve on a Board of Education in Maine, and was superintendent of schools in Caribou for four years. In 1900, she was owner and publisher of the Aroostook Register, and president of the Maine Federation of Women's Clubs; that year, her uncle, oilman Wallace Hardison, invited her to California to join the editorial staff the Los Angeles Herald, which he owned. She also wrote and edited for the magazine California Outlook. and wrote political opinion pieces for various publications.

He is one of the pioneers of supersymmetry (c.f. Fayet-Iliopoulos term). In 1987, he received the prestigious JJ Sakurai Award. He was one of the founders, at the École normale supérieure, of the Laboratory of Theoretical Physics (LPTENS), which he directed from 1991 to 1995 and from 1998 to 2002. Jean Iliopoulos has been a member of the French Academy of Sciences since 2002.Jean Iliopoulos, physicien des particules - Médaillé Dirac 2007, 8 aout 2007 In 2007, he won the Dirac Award for his prediction (with Sheldon Glashow and Luciano Maiani) of charming quark.  Scientific work  Jean Iliopoulos is a specialist in high energy theoretical physics and elementary particle physics. In 1970, in collaboration with S.L. Glashow and L. Maïani, he introduced the so-called \\"GIM\\" mechanism (named after the three authors) which is an essential element of the theory of fundamental interactions known as the \\"Standard Model \\". This mechanism postulates the existence of a new elementary particle, the \\"charmed\\" quark, a prediction that was confirmed by experience. In 1972, in collaboration with Claude Bouchiat and Philippe Meyer, he demonstrated that the mathematical coherence of the Standard Model requires symmetry between the elementary constituents of matter, namely quarks (which form hadrons such as proton and neutron) and leptons (such as electron, muon and neutrinos). This symmetry is also verified experimentally. Jean Iliopoulos was one of the pioneers of supersymetry, the hypothetical symmetry that links fermions and bosons. He showed that it has remarkable convergence properties and, in collaboration with P. Fayet, he proposed a mechanism that leads to its spontaneous breakage. He also studied some aspects of the quantum theory of gravitation as well as the mathematical properties of invariant gauge theories formulated in a non-commutative geometric space.

His work focuses on transcendentalism, attaining spiritual or moral enlightenment, and the balance and order of the universe.  Life  Joe Light grew up on a farm outside of Dyersburg, Tennessee with his mother, Virgie (Virgin) Mary, and father, Hiawatha. He became estranged from his parents as a young boy and completed until the eighth at Brewer High School. He spent his youth farming until he enlisted in the army in March 1951. However, in August of that same year, he was discharged because, as he said, \\"I found out they were going to send me to Korea, so I hurt my arm.\\" Shortly after leaving the military, he was imprisoned from 1954-55 for armed robbery of a grocery store. He was also imprisoned in the Nashville penitentiary from 1960–66 and 1966-68. During his first prison sentence, Light met a Rabbi and converted to Judaism. He recalled that hearing the Old Testament \\"was the first time something a preacher said ever made good sense to me.\\" Light was married twice. He married and had two children in his early twenties, but left that family before going to prison in 1960. After his release from prison in 1966, he traveled to various places in the southern mid-west courting women for marriage. According to Light's account, he traveled to Arkansas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, and Tennessee in search of a wife. He met Rosie Lee Cotton, and immediately after his second release from prison, he married her on September 1, 1968. Together they raised five sons and five daughters outside of Memphis, Tennessee. Light rented a booth at the local flea market as his main source of income. He re- purposed salvaged or vintage goods and sold them at the market. He never sold his paintings or signage there. Light was an outspoken recluse. Although he rarely left his house or socialized with his neighbors, he maintained an almost Evangelical approach to spreading political justice and Old Testament- derived morality. \\"He [had] the fervor of a convert; he believed that he had the answers to solve the world's problems.\\" Light died on August 6, 2005 at age 70 and is buried in the West Tennessee State Veterans Cemetery.  Career  Joe Light loosely began making art after his conversion to Judaism. As he traveled the southern mid-west searching for a wife, he began chalking and graffiting moral codes and Old Testament verses on public spaces. Graffiti helped him develop his style of signage, which he used to proselytize his code of ethics. Once he married Rosie Lee Cotton and settled down into his home on Looney St. in Memphis in 1970, he used his home as his main base for communicating his messages. He took inspiration from his graffiti in the 1960s and began writing ethical and moral commands on the shutters and siding of his home. = Materials = Light uses found driftwood from the Mississippi for some of his sculptures. He uses other found material such as old T.V. sets and hubcaps for his paintings and assemblages. Many of his paintings were produced with house paint on thin plywood. = Inspirations = Religion and his personal faith were Light's greatest inspirations. \\"Renouncing the Baptist Christianity of his youth, he developed a personal faith conditioned by the racial prejudice he experienced in the precivil rights era South, as well as suspicion toward Christianity’s effects on colonized peoples.\\" Aesthetically, Light was heavily influenced by pop-art and commercialism of the mid twentieth century. His paintings feature illustrative outlines of landscapes or portraits in black, filled in with bold, saturated, often monochrome colors. Some art historians argue that Light's iconic, Pop Art- inspired painting style was influenced by his constant exposure to advertisements and branding while selling and refurbishing common wares at the market. His two inspirations, spirituality and commercialism combined often, such as in his piece Hobo # Birdman (1988) in which the recurring Hobo character is walking towards two commercially made postcards that have been inlaid into the painting. Another example is a painting that was documented inside Light's home of Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm, two characters from the prolific Flintstones cartoons, riding on a serpent through a garden. = Home = Before Light began making autonomous paintings and sculptures, he adorned his home with paintings and signs of his messages. On the outside, his home conveyed his beliefs clearly on race, politics, and spirituality for passersby. For those unfamiliar, Light spelled out his messages in clear, written English or bold narrative imagery, so as to make interpretation as easy as possible.This interpretation would have to be done by the outsiders themselves because Light rarely interacted with the public personally. He fortified his yard and home such that no one could enter without his discretion. \\"His yard is completely enclosed by fences. 'I don't want nobody coming in,' Light explains, but he really doesn't want anyone going out either.\\" Light was hyper-aware of the dangers that the outside world posed to his African American Jewish children. Since he bore the weight of racial, political, economic, and social injustice in his lifetime, he wanted to spare his children as much of that injustice as possible. Inside his home, he wrote messages on the walls in Arabesque script, which he referred to as \\"Abraham's language.\\" His paintings on the inside of his house also became more abstract and difficult to discern an obvious theological narrative from. \\"Because he has had no human mentor to guide and advise him along his life's treacherous road, he serves as his own counsel, as a Moses illuminating the way, fighting the adversaries, and leading himself toward the Promised Land.\\" = Recurring imagery = The Hobo and the Birdman appear as recurring folkloric images in Light's work. Both trace their origins to Light's journey to conversion and spiritual enlightenment. The Hobo represents an unenlightened person searching for meaning. Light has painted four versions of The Hobo, one black, one white, one red, and one yellow, in reference to his multi-cultural heritage. He situated the Hobo amidst nature, typically beside a river or mountain range, which represents the impasse that The Hobo must traverse to attain enlightenment. The Birdman is the antithesis of the Hobo; he is the enlightened one. When Light first heard the voice of God calling him to Judaism, a bird flew into the window of his cell in the penitentiary. For Light, the bird has since been a symbol of divine intervention and of God himself. It is not uncommon to see the Hobo and the Birdman together in the same painting, as one must accompany the other on their spiritual journey.

After 1933 her brand of political cabaret was no longer permitted and she found herself subject of a Berufsverbot (government work ban): she left Berlin and supported herself as a regional (unnamed) radio announcer. She was able to return to the stage after 1945, however. Biography =Early years= Katharina Nehrhaupt was born in Cologne where her father worked as a physician. He recognized and backed his daughter's artistic ambitions from early on. As a nineteen year old, shortly after the end of the World War I, she came to Berlin in 1919 to obtain a classical training as a singer. She was accepted at the prestigious Stern Conservatory (today part of the Berlin University of the Arts), and quickly acquired the potential to build a career as an oratorio singer. But she very soon parted company with the mainstream classical repertoire. Katharina preferred to engage with the more bohemian world in the western part of Berlin, with its coffee houses and artists' districts that clustered around the (at that time complete) Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church. A particularly fashionable meeting point for the youthful postwar arts and literature set was the Café des Westens (often identified by the mocking soubriquet Café Größenwahn) on the corner of the Kurfürstendamm and the . Another regular at the Café Größenwahn was the sculptor Karsten Kühl (?–1964). They married in or around 1920. Kühl was instrumental in Katharina's decision to become a cabaret artiste. =Cabaret and theatre= It was Karsten Kühl who mentioned to his young wife that he had heard that the established cabaretiste Rosa Valetti was planning to set up her own \\"literary cabaret\\" upstairs, directly above the Café des Westens. Kate Kühl sent the famous artist a letter offering her services and was instantly offered a job by Valetti. Four days after her twenty-first birthday, on 23 December 1920, she made her stage debut, performing a series of chansons to her first cabaret audience. Her restrained yet somehow coarse delivery created overnight a completely new style of somehow erotic ballad style cabaret presentation, which she applied effectively to the lyrics of Klabund and Walter Mehring. Her debut did not go unremarked, and she quickly came to know musicians and composers such as Friedrich Hollaender and Werner Richard Heymann. She also was also befriended by \\"rival artistes\\" including Blandine Ebinger and Annemarie Hase. But within this circle there was one new friendship which would be more important and long-lasting than any of these others in building and sustaining her artistic career: according to one commentator, for Kühl's idiosyncratic performing style the couplets penned by Kurt Tucholsky resonated just as finely as the songs, chansons and ballads of Mehring or indeed Brecht. The first song that Tucholsky both wrote himself and had performed in public, \\"Schiff ahoi!\\", was indeed written for \\"his muse\\", Kate Kühl. The \\"Cabaret Größenwahn\\", as it had become known, under the leadership of Rosa Valetti, flourished only briefly. Postwar Weimar Germany was overwhelmed by crippling reparation requirements and hyperinflation between 1921 and 1923. Many cabaret venues were forced to close down, but some nevertheless survived. That was the context in which Trude Hesterberg was able to entice Kühl to work at her cabaret, the Wilde Bühne in the , at which (again) Kurt Tucholsky was a regular patron. Tucholsky's chanson \\"Die Dorfschöne\\", dedicated, as he expressed it, to his \\"Kulicke\\", dates from this period. In February 1924 \\"Tucho\\" accepted an offer from Siegfried Jacobsohn which involved moving to Paris as a theatre critic for Die Weltbühne and the Vossische Zeitung, but he retained in frequent contact with her, both on account of his regular trips home to Berlin and through an animated exchange of letters which was at once professional and friendly. During the second part of the 1920s, Kühl performed on all Berlin's principal cabaret stages including those at (KadeKo) at Die Katakombe. She also enjoyed professional success on the Berlin theatre stage, appearing on 31 August 1928 at the Theater am Schiffbauerdamm in the premiere of The Threepenny Opera by Kurt Weill und Bertolt Brecht. She was engaged to play the part of Lucy, the daughter of the London police chief. =National Socialist years= By the early 1930s the glory days of Berlin cabaret were fading. As politics in the country became more polarised, the remaining cabaret shows became less politicised, content to sooth patrons with happy melodies. Outside on the streets violent confrontations between Nazi Paramilitaries and communist \\"Red Front Fighters\\" were becoming more frequent and more bitter. Kühl and the other performers made no secret of their hostility to Nazism and after the power seizure in January 1933 many of the better known cabaret celebrities disappeared overnight, turning up abroad a few weeks later. Most, including Kühl, were prevented from pursuing their careers in Nazi Germany by a Berufsverbot (government work bans). Nevertheless, she remained in Germany, working as an unnamed radio announcer on local radio stations and supplementing her income by sometimes taking supporting roles in entertainment films. =After the war= Directly after the war, Kühl became a member of one of the first newly established Berlin Cabaret groups, Die Außenseiter (The Outsiders), co-founded by Curth Flatow. Many of her closest friends and associates from before World War II were by now dead. One who was still very much around was Ernst Busch, with whom she now formed a close and enduring professional friendship. It was Busch who persuaded her to cross the (at this stage still for many purposes invisible and ignorable) border into the eastern part of Berlin, which had ended up after May 1945 as part of the Soviet occupation zone. She also took the significant step of joining a political party, the Communist Party. Together Kühl and Busch appeared in the productions of Bertolt Brecht. It was also Busch who helped her launch her career as a recording artist in the Soviet zone (relaunched in October 1949 as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic (East Germany)). Then, after Brecht and Helene Weigel, his wife, launched the Berliner Ensemble in 1949, she appeared in several stage productions with that company. She also embarked on musical collaborations with Brecht's friend, the composer Hanns Eisler and, later, with the composer-librettist Boris Blacher. The so-called Inner German border remained relatively permeable through much of the 1950s, and in the middle of the decade Kühl relocated from East Berlin to West Berlin. By this time the Cold War had become a fact of life for Europeans, and she had moved close to the West German Social Democratic Party which she supported, most particularly, in the struggle against the growing threat of another major war.

The site was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 2001. Overview The site consists of five large burial mounds, located in the Kamata area of what is now the city of Iwata: The Shorinzan Kofun (松林山古墳), Takeneyama Kofun (高根山古墳). Mikuridōyama Kofun (御厨堂山古墳), the Inariyama Kofun (稲荷山古墳) and the Akihayama Kofun (秋葉山古墳). The site is divided by the Tōkaidō Main Line railway tracks, with the Inariyama Kojun and the Akihayama Kofun located to the north of the tracks, and the others to the south. The largest, the Shorinzan Kofun, is a keyhole-shaped tumulus located on the north side of Shimmei Junior High School and measures approximately 107 meters in length, with a 66.5 meter diameter circular portion and height of 10 meters. An excavation was conducted in 1931, at which time a long stone burial chamber was discovered with a large number of grave goods, including one triangular-rimmed bronze mirror, one bronze mirror depicting four animals, two bronze mirrors depicting flowers, magatama, tubular beads, weapons (straight swords, iron and bronze spears, daggers) and agricultural tools (axes, sickles, saws) were discovered. The mound was covered in fukiishi and the remains of many haniwa were found. From the artifacts, it dates to the second half of the 4th century. The Takaneyama Kofun is a dome-shaped tumulus with a diameter of 52 meters and height of 8 meters. It is the third largest in the prefecture. The surface was covered with fukiishi and both cylindrical and pot-shaped hanawa. It was built at the end of the 4th century. The Mikuridōyama Kofun is a keyhole-shaped tumulus with total length of 34,5 meters and height of 4 meters. A mirror and a sword have been recovered from its interior. The Akihaya Kofun and the Inariyama Kofun are located behind the Buddhist temple of Renjō-ji and are survivors of what was once a group of four tumuli. The largest of this group, the Kyōzuka Kofun (経塚古墳), was a keyhole-shaped tomb with a length of 90 meters, but was destroyed in the early Meiji period to make way for the Tōkaidō Main Line railway, during which time an ancient bronze mirror was recovered. The Akihaya Kofun is dome-shaped, with a diameter of 46 to 50 meters and a height of 8 meters. The Inariyama Kofun is keyhole-shaped, with a total length of 46.5 meters and height of 6 meters. Jar-shaped haniwa have been recovered from the vicinity.

The music of the film is composed by Vishal Chandrasekhar and Sricharan Pakala. The film follows an undercover agent named Arjun, who races against time to rescue his teammates after they are kidnapped by a Pakistani terrorist named Sohail. Disavowed by his own agency after his cover gets blown, he sets out on the rescue operation in Karachi and enlists the help of another RAW agent Zubeida to accomplish the mission. Chanakya was released theatrically on 5 October 2019. Plot In order to catch Abdul Salim, the right hand of India's most wanted terrorist Ibrahim Qureshi, the RAW chief Kulkarni recruits agent Arjun and his team. Once Salim arrives at the spot, Arjun and his teammates eliminate all the guards and manage to take Salim in their custody. In the meanwhile, Arjun resumes his life as a banker named Ramakrishna and learns from Kulkarni that Salim would be shifted to prison as per the orders. Arjun warns him not to do so, fearing that there might be an attempt to rescue him. Nevertheless, Salim is dispatched in a police van accompanied by other vehicles. However, masked shooters from a chopper attack the cars and free Salim. Once he boards the chopper, the attackers are revealed to be Arjun and his teammates. Feeling Salim is not needed since his existence would be a threat to the nation's security, Arjun shoots him. Later, when Arjun is on a date with his girlfriend Aishwarya, he is attacked by some goons and a fight ensues, resulting in Arjun learning about the capture of his teammates. The kidnapper is none other than Sohail, the son of Ibrahim Qureshi's. He challenges Arjun to come to Karachi and rescue his teammates, due to which Arjun seeks the help from his agency but is disavowed due to his cover getting blown. He uses his own resources to get himself into Pakistan, where he meets a RAW agent named Zubeida. Together, they plant CCTV cameras on Sohail's route to learn of his destination. Realizing that there is no signal whenever his vehicles pass, Arjun believes the traffic police commissioner to be getting information about Sohail's destination. Zubeida gets the commissioner engaged at a bar and helps Arjun digitally acquire the officer's fingerprints and voice activation to unlock his laptop. The officer learns of someone sneaking in and rushes back but in vain. Arjun and Zubeida learn that Sohail is going to attend a function at a hotel and plan to kidnap him. When all their plans fail, Arjun shows up and manages to kidnap Sohail. However, at their secret location, Arjun and Zubeida realize that they have kidnapped Sohail's body double instead of Sohail himself. An enraged Arjun shoots him, and seeing Qureshi's henchmen coming for him, runs away attacking them. In the ensuing chase, Arjun gets shot, while Ibrahim declares a manhunt for Arjun who manages to hide and is eventually rescued by Zubeida. Sohail manages to retrieve the CCTV cameras set up by Zubeida and kills Arjun's friend on the camera. However, Arjun tells Zubeida to rewind the footage and learns that his friend had sent him a message through Morse code. They learn that Sohail is planning to flee Arjun's teammates and get the G8 Summit attacked so that they can frame India by showing the footage of Arjun and his teammates in Karachi. This would be seen as India's attempt to disgrace Pakistan and India would in turn be disgraced. In order to stop this and continue Mission Chanakya, Arjun reunites Kulkarni, who is then revealed to have told him to meet Zubeida. Using the information from other RAW agents in Karachi, Arjun manages to trace Sohail's location and beats him up. He then makes a deal with Ibrahim to arrive at the border with Arjun's teammates in exchange for Sohail's life. Once the deal is done, Ibrahim realizes that Arjun gave him Sohail's body double, who was not killed by the shooting and saved on time. With Sohail now in Indian custody, Ibrahim challenges to free him but is instead himself handed over to India. Arjun is congratulated by the RAW before he shoots the mole dead in front of his officers.

She is recognized as a martyr and was proclaimed blessed on 8 December 2018.  Biography  Odette Prévost was born in Champagne in Oger in the Marne department of France on 17 July 1932Georgeon & Henning. She became a teacher and taught English for three years, at Avize. She asked herself the question of the religious vocation, and thought first of all about Cistercian life, but then decided to follow the footsteps of Charles de Foucauld. She joined the Little Sisters of the Sacred Heart at age 21, in 1953. For her first mission, Prévost was sent in 1958 to Morocco, to Kbab, among the Berbers. She served at the clinic, and gave girls knitting and sewing classes. She thus met the Muslims and their culture. Prévost made perpetual profession in 1959. She also met for a year Father Peyriguère, the famous French hermit who lived alone nearby in the Moroccan Atlas, imitating Father de Foucauld. Recalled in France, where she worked among the Argenteuil laborious and disadvantaged population, she wanted to move back to Algiers, where she arrived in 1968, in the district of Kouba. She participated in the founding of a community of Sisters, and lived in the same destitution as the local population. Desiring to better master language and culture, she moved to Rome in 1980 to study classical Arabic and Islamic sciences for two years. Returning to Algiers, she joined the Diocesan Cultural Center \\"Glycines\\", where she was alternately librarian and teacher of Arabic. She was also part of Ribat-el-Salam (Link of Peace) where she met the monks of Tibhirine According to the Prioress General of her order, she was tall and intellectually gifted, but did not possess an easy temperament. She criticized the authorities and was rather often worried; but a few months before her death she had manifestly transformed herself, as another future martyr, the bishop of Oran Pierre Claverie, noticed : \\"because when you risk your own life, you have to go to the essential. \\" On 10 November 1995, at around 8:30 am, she went with another sister to attend mass when an Islamist terrorist came out of a car and shot her at point blank range. Prévost died instantly, her friend was seriously injured in the jaw She was recognized a martyr in January 2018 by Pope Francis, then proclaimed blessed during the beatification ceremony on 8 December 2018 in Algeria, in Oran, with the group of martyrs of Algeria. It was the first beatification ceremony in a country with a Muslim majority.  Quote  Prayer composed by Prévost, found on her just after her death: \\"Do live today, God gives it to you, it is yours. Live it into Him. The day of tomorrow is God's, it does not belong to you. Do not worry about tomorrow, do not charge it by today's concerns. Tomorrow is God's, give it back to Him. The present moment is a frail bridge, if you load it by yesterday's regrets, tomorrow's worry, the bridge will collapse and you shall lose your footing. The past ? God forgives it. The future ? God gives it. Live today's day in communion with Him.\\"  References   Bibliography  * Thomas Georgeon & Christophe Henning, Nos vies sont déjà données, Bayard, 2018.

Today they are divided into five main groups: Utes, Goshutes, Paiutes, Shoshone, and Navajo. Each occupies a different region within the state, many of which regions extend across borders into other states. In the 2010 census, there were a total of 32,927 American Indian and Alaska Natives living within the state, which totaled to 1.19% of the total population of Utah.  Pre-European Arrival Evidence has shown that people have been drawn to areas in Utah as long as 10,000 years ago, specifically in the Escalante Valley in Southern Utah as well as in the Great Basin, near the Utah/Nevada border. The earliest time in Utah's human history is classified by archaeologists as Paleoachaic, which dates back to 11,000 years ago, with evidences of occupation over 11 feet below the current ground level. There is very little information on these times, except that the peoples depended on wild foods to sustain themselves. Hunters had much success in going after deer, beaver, marmots, and even poultry such as ducks, grouse, and turkeys. Different tools were used to capture prey, and after the kill the leftover meat was dried and preserved. The men primarily did the hunting, while the women searched for plants and processed them. Occasionally they participated in small game hunting. The practice of farming only started to become popular in the first few centuries A.D. and continued until around A.D.1300. In these farms many things were grown such as corn, beans, and squash, meanwhile the practice of hunting and gathering continued. During this period trade also became very important among the people of the Fremont culture and the Anasazi, who inhabited the region. Although much information about these ancient peoples is gained through archaeology, it is only after the arrival of Europeans in the 1700s that their history is preserved through writing.  Arrival of European Settlers  = Spanish Explorers = Spain was the \\"owner\\" of most of the western part of Utah before the westward expansion by the United States. In 1765, Juan Maria Antonia Rivera and his party may have been some of the first Euro-Americans to explore parts of Utah. 11 years later, Dominguez and Escalante traveled through Utah, in what would be become a famous expedition. The Spanish \\"claimed\\" the land, although the number of Indigenous peoples inhabiting the land far outnumbered the few Spanish explorers. = Fur Trappers and Traders = For around the next 85 years mainly fur trappers and traders would pass through the state. Jedediah Smith and Jim Bridger were among the first, later followed by Peter Skene Ogden, Miles Goodyear, and Etienne Provost. The relations between the trappers and Natives were varied, some were friendly and some were hostile. Overtime the trappers and traders learned to communicate better with the Natives, first through signs and later on some even learned their native tongues and intermarried with the Native women. = Mormon Pioneers = Mormon Pioneer handcart statue July 24, 1847 is recognized as the day the Mormon Pioneers entered into the Salt Lake Valley. This day is now a holiday celebrated in Utah, known as Pioneer Day. However, when the Mormon Pioneers arrived, they did not happen onto an empty landscape. It is estimated that around 20,000 Native Americans already inhabited the land now encompassed by the boundaries of Utah. The first few years of settlement, the relations were generally peaceful and some trading occurred. As the pioneers would settle the land beyond the Salt Lake Valley, the Native Americans became more displaced and tensions started to arise. Although most conflicts were resolved peacefully, this was the start of the deterioration of the relations. In 1853 the Walker War was started, and was then followed by the Black Hawk War in 1865. Once the 1870s began, federal policy on Native American relations began to be enacted in a more organized manner, which created less personal disputes among the Natives and the settlers. This was the start of a period of around 100 years with many different policies and practices regarding the Native Americans in Utah and across the country.  Native Americans Today  = Education = Since 1900, fifty percent of Native Americans have been enrolled in public school. The government did not want a large need for Indian reservations so they used public schools as a way to assimilate Native Americans into white culture. The idea was that the Native Americans would leave their culture behind by assimilating to white culture. Overall, the feeling of white Utah residents regarding the integration of Native Americans was not positive. Many teachers were openly against the integration and that made school difficult for Native Americans. The hostility was in part because Native Americans lived on non-taxable reservations so they did not pay taxes for school. There were reported incidents of bus drivers not picking up Native American students. Racism was present in the school system. This problem continued for Native American children until the Indian Education Act of 1972. This helped some Native American children but a lot of Native American children dropped out of school before this. = Government and Sovereignty = The history of Native American sovereignty is usually divided into four categories: aboriginal culture and sovereignty in pre-Columbian times, movement of Native Americans onto reservations, assimilation through policy passed by Congress, and modern efforts of the Native Americans to establish sovereignty in Indian Country. Flag of the Paiute Tribe in Utah This history has created much confusion between the distinction of Native American sovereignty and the powers of the federal government. They were recognized as individual nations with treaty-making powers, with the right to their land and to govern however they desire, but also the process of assimilation sought to dissolve these powers. In regards to the rights of property and lands, it is stated that the lands in the state of Utah designated for Native Americans are reserved from \\"settlement, entry, sale, or other disposition and set aside of the use and benefit of [the Goshute] and other Indians on the public domain in the State of Utah\\" One of the most recent acts passed involving the Native Americans was the 1975 Indian Self Determination and Education Assistance Act, which has allowed the tribes greater freedom in governing themselves through the administering of federal programs and having more control over their resources. = Reservations = Indian Reservations are places that are designated as places for Indigenous people to live. These places are run by the government of a specific Indigenous Nation instead of the state governments of the United States of America. Federally recognized tribes govern the reservations. These tribes have a government-to-government relationship with the United States of America, just like any government-to- government relationship the United States has with other countries' governments. Reservations in Utah include The Skull Valley Reservation which is located in Tooele County, Utah. The Goshute people are the federally recognized tribe there. There is also the Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation, on which the Ute tribe is the federally recognized tribe to govern the land. This reservation is the second-largest in the US and is located in the Uintah, Duchesne, Wasatch, Grand, Carbon, Utah and Emery counties in Utah. However, not all indigenous people that live in Utah live on Indian Reservations. About 46% of indigenous people in Utah live in urban Salt Lake. Many also live in Weber, Utah, and Davis counties. The majority of the remaining 54% of the indigenous people in Utah live on the reservations.  Cultures  = Ute = 4 Utes in 1878 The Ute people are native to the states of Arizona, Utah, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Wyoming and Arizona. The language they speak is Shoshonean. They are ancestors of Uto-Aztecs and the people are now divided up into groups called bands. The bands of the Ute People include The Mouache, The Caputa, The Weenuchiu, The White River Ute, and The Pahvant. The Ute people used many different strategies to acquire food for their families. They would gather food from wild plants. Also the men would typically hunt larger animals while women would trap smaller animals. There were some bands of the Ute people that began to farm, while others discovered how to use plants for medicine. = Goshute = The Goshute people are native to the Desert Region of the Great Salt Lake in Utah. They were very effective hunters and gatherers in this Desert Region. In their tradition, they believe to have always lived in the Desert Region of the Great Salt Lake. Living in the desert region provided some benefits for the Goshutes, such as not being bothered by white settlers until the middle of the 1800s when Mormon settlers arrived. When this happened they were pushed out of their territory. = Paiute = The Paiute people are native to Utah and were a nomadic people that traveled quite frequently. Their original territory covered 30 million acres, in which they moved around following the seasons and animal migration. Paiutes were relatively unharmed by European settlement until the 1850s when Mormon settlers came to their territory. The most notable interaction between the Paiutes and the Mormons was in 1857 during the Mountain Meadows Massacre. After this massacre, the Paiute people have been very vocal about not being involved, while the Mormons at the time of the incident blamed them. = Shoshone = The Shoshone people are native to Wyoming, Idaho and Utah. The name Shoshone means \\"high growing grasses\\" they are sometimes referred to as the \\"Grass House People.\\" The Shoshone people are native to the Great Basin area. They were mainly a hunter and gatherer type of people with bison meat being their most important resource. = Navajo = The Navajo people are native to the southwestern states of New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, and Colorado. They are the second-largest federally recognized tribe in the country with 300,000 people enrolled as Navajo. The people were largely hunters and gatherers but eventually adopted farming techniques. The Navajo people originally lived in places that are now modern-day Mexico but when Spanish explorers came they were pushed back to Southern Utah and other southwest states.

It was released in 1978. Background Thomas wrote several different versions of Mignon. For productions in Germany, he composed a new, tragic finale more in keeping with the Goethe novel on which the opera's libretto was based. For a production in London's Drury Lane in 1870, he made more comprehensive alterations. Firstly, the finale was shortened. Secondly, dialogue was replaced by recitative. Thirdly, Lothario's Act 1 aria acquired an extra verse. Fourthly, Philine was given an extra aria, inserted after the Act 2 entr'acte. And finally, Frédéric was changed from a buffo tenor into a contralto, and was awarded his Act 2 Gavotte to appease the singer who was to perform the regendered role. The version of the opera presented on de Almeida's album largely follows Thomas's 1870 edition, except that Philine's insert aria – for which the original orchestration has been lost – is consigned to an appendix, where its accompaniment is provided by a harpsichord and a flute. A further appendix presents the longer, original version of the opera's finale. (The finale that Thomas composed for German consumption is not included.) With the exception of the finale, every number for which Thomas composed more than one version is presented in the longest variant extant. The album was only the second complete recording of the opera committed to disc, and the first to be taped stereophonically. Recording The album was recorded using analogue technology between 20 June and 18 July 1977 in All Saints' Church, Tooting Graveney, London. It was prepared for reissue on CD using 20-bit remastering. Packaging The cover of the LP version of the album was designed under the art direction of Allan Weinberg and featured a photograph by Sarah Moon.Thomas, Ambroise: Mignon, cond. Antonio de Almeids, Sony CD, SM3K 34590, 1998 The cover of the CD version, identical to the LP's apart from minor additional lettering, was designed under the art direction of Roxanne Slimak. Critical reception =Reviews= Ambroise Thomas in 1865, a year before Mignon's première Alan Blyth reviewed the album on LP in Gramophone in October 1978. Marilyn Horne's performance in the title role was impressive, he thought, but not ideal. Yes, she had the coloratura skills needed for her Styrienne. Yes, she had the requisite breath control for a slow-paced \\"Connais-tu le pays?\\" And yes, she was compelling in the Act 2 scene in which Mignon was brought to the brink of suicide by her hopeless misery over Wilhelm's crush on Philine. But her reminiscence of home lacked the pathos and \\"dream-like nostalgia\\" that Conchita Supervia had found in it. Her decision to essay a role that lay somewhat high for her low mezzo-soprano meant that her singing sometimes sounded laboured. And her \\"big and full\\" tone could be a \\"little too aggressive\\" for a character as unassuming as Mignon. Ruth Welting, by contrast, was ideally cast as an \\"enchanting\\" Philine, bringing \\"just the right coquettish charm\\" to the role of the happy-go-lucky actress. Welting sang with the \\"light insouciance\\" of the great French soubrettes of yesteryear, and delivered her coloratura and trills with an expert, irresistible brilliance. As Frédéric, Frederica von Stade sang \\"breezily and cleanly\\" in her dance through his famous Gavotte. Her \\"delightfully fresh and liquid sound\\" made Blyth wonder how she would have fared if CBS had allotted Mignon to her instead of to Horne. Alain Vanzo, \\"elegant and involved\\", was blessed with exactly the right type of voice for Wilhelm, and his versions of the student's showpiece arias were in no way inferior to those recorded by even the most revered tenors of Mignon's heyday. The veteran Nicola Zaccaria, finally, mined every last nugget of gold from the part of Mignon's father, \\"a gift of a part for a warm bass\\". Zaccaria's age meant that his top notes were poorly focused, and he mishandled Lothario's Berceuse, but he came across as invariably endearing. For the rest, no-one was likely to mistake the Ambrosian Singers for Francophones, but the orchestra sounded as though they would have been at home in the pit of the Palais Garnier. Antonio de Almeida, evincing an obvious love for Thomas's music, erred only in not always choosing tempi judiciously. The album as a whole had only two drawbacks. Firstly, de Almeida's decision to use Thomas's recitatives rather than the libretto's original dialogue meant that the impact of the opera's mélodrames was lessened. Secondly, the album's engineering was disappointing. The sound was recessed, there was an irritating amount of reverberation and the singers seemed to be in a different acoustic from the orchestra. But these negatives should not deter people from investigating a commendable performance of what was, Blyth affirmed, \\"an attractive and sometimes first-rate score\\".Gramophone, October 1978, pp. 741–742 Librettist Michel Carré George Jellinek reviewed the album on LP in Stereo Review in February 1979. Like Blyth, he acknowledged the many good things that Horne brought to the opera - her genius for vocal gymnastics, her dependable evenness of tone, her dramatic intensity in Mignon's Act 2 crisis. But, also like Blyth, he did not think that she was the right artist to portray a character of \\"naïveté and childlike simplicity\\". Confronted by a Mignon sung with a voice as mature and authoritative as hers, \\"credulity [was] severely tested in being asked to accept [her] as a forlorn waif\\". Fortunately, Horne's was the only casting that was questionable. Ruth Welting's Philine was \\"altogether excellent\\". Her Polonaise did not have as much devil-may-care élan as it might have done, but it was precise and it culminated in a firework of a high F. Frederica von Stade, admirable too, sang Frédéric's Gavotte with \\"lightness and charm\\". Alain Vanzo sang Wilhelm in a style that was authentically French: moreover, his lyric tenor had an instrumental purity, maintaining its quality even in its highest reaches. There was \\"tenderness as well as elegance\\" in his portrayal. As Lothario, Nicola Zaccaria compensated for the toll that old age had taken on his higher notes by singing evenly and touchingly. He made Mignon's father both believable and a man that one cared about. Antonio de Almeida gave the opera \\"an appropriately pastoral, fairy- tale aura through a sensitive and refined reading\\", although his conducting would have been even better with less of a bias towards tempi that trudged when they should have strode. The one point at which Jellinek disagreed with Blyth was over the album's engineering, which he judged to be good if not exceptionally so.Stereo Review, February 1979, p. 102 Librettist Jules Barbier J. B. Steane reviewed the album on LP in Gramophone in July 1979, seeing eye to eye with Blyth and Jellinek in his critique of Marilyn Horne. Even though her voice was no longer all that it had been in its prime, her tone was still \\"quite exceptionally rich and gorgeous\\", \\"most lovely, for instance, in the velvety opening phrases of 'Connais-tu le pays?'\\" This said, her Mignon seldom sounded like the teenager that she was meant to be. Frederica von Stade made a success of Frédéric's gleeful Gavotte, and Ruth Welting, who had disappointed Steane when singing Sophie opposite von Stade's Octavian,Der Rosenkavalier (Edo de Waart recording) pleased him better with a Philine who was precise and tidy. He did not find the album's male principals quite as praiseworthy as its women. Alain Vanzo, whom he thought the best French tenor of his era, seemed to sing some of Wilhelm's music with too much vim as though to ward off any perception that the character was rather puny. Nicola Zaccaria's voice, despite its consistency, could not help betraying the singer's advancing years. Antonio de Almeida's conducting, mostly appropriate, was flawed in sometimes delivering an adagio when an andantino was what was called for. The opera itself Steane thought good except at its very end, where Thomas had been unable to respond adequately to the dramatic demands of the story's climax. This lapse apart, it was \\"a delightful score, attractively orchestrated, full of grace and melody. I enjoyed it immensely.\\"Gramophone, July 1979, pp. 169–170 =Accolade= In February 1979, Stereo Review included the album in its list of Best Recordings of the Month.

Biography Born on April 9, 1839. He studied at the boarding school of Count Suzor and the 2nd Saint Petersburg Gymnasium, in 1860 he graduated from the course of Saint Petersburg University as a candidate of historical and philological faculty and for some time taught at the gymnasium of the Human–Loving Society. In the same year he was enlisted in the Foreign Trade Department of the Ministry of Finance (80 Moika Embankment). In 1863 he defended his thesis for a master's degree in Russian literature \\"On the Epics of the Vladimir Cycle\\", in which he proposed a historical point of view on the origin of epics: he indicated, in particular, that the epics of the Vladimirov cycle are a reflection of the Kiev specific period. After the defense, he did not last long in the Ministry of Finance and in 1864 he moved to the Central Statistical Committee and until 1882 took an active part in its work, as well as in international statistical congresses. Since 1868 – professor at the Saint Petersburg Archaeological Institute. In 1882 he was appointed assistant director of the Imperial Public Library. In 1889 he was elected an academician, in 1893 he was appointed vice president of the Academy of Sciences. By rank of vice president, he was chairman of the Emperor Nicholas II Foundation to assist writers and scholars. A member of the Russian Geographical Society (since 1864; in 1871 he headed the ethnographic department, In 1872–1886 he was the chairman of the ethnographic department, edited several of its publications, including five volumes of \\"Notes on the Ethnography Department\\"), a member of the Archaeographic Commission (since 1876; since 1885 – ruler of affairs, from 1899 – chairman), Moscow Archaeological Society. In 1868–1882 he was an assistant editor, in 1882–1890 – editor of the Journal of the Ministry of Education. He began his literary activity as a student; posted a long series of historical and literary articles and reviews in \\"Domestic Notes\\", \\"Dawn\\", \\"Russian Herald\\", \\"Ancient and New Russia\\", \\"Russian Antiquity\\", \\"Russian Archive\\", \\"Journal of the Ministry of Public Education\\", \\"Historical Bulletin\\", \\"Russian Philological Bulletin\\" and others. The most important of them are devoted to Simeon Polotsky, Lomonosov, Vasily Maykov, Sumarokov, Krylov, the history of Russian journalism, the ancient Russian story, the history of Russian superstitions and are collected under the title \\"Essays from the History of Russian Literature of the 17th and 18th Centuries\\" (Saint Petersburg, 1889, 1893). Separately published \\"Materials and Research on Ancient Russian Literature\\" (1890–1891). In 1889, a compilation of works by Konstantin Batyushkov was edited (with the assistance of Vladimir Saitov) by Leonid Maykov with great care. In 1891, he edited and characterized the collection of critical experiences of his brother Valerian. In his master's thesis, Maikov showed significant scientific independence. In an era of almost undivided domination of the mythological explanation of folk poetry, he put forward a historical point of view on the origin of Russian epics, with which scholars of this dark issue are still reckoned with. In his opinion, the Russian epic is a true echo of Russian historical life, and, in particular, the epics of the Vladimirov cycle, the Kiev specific period. Many heroes of epics – Dobrynya, Alyosha Popovich, Sadko, Ilya Muromets – the author, comparing the annals, considers them to be truly existing; in household details, he indicates traces of the actual historical life of 10th–13th centuries. Epics arose, in his opinion, among the squads. He died on April 20, 1900.

During the Rams' 36–31 victory over the Seattle Seahawks on November 11, 2018, Rath was recorded by NFL Films shadowing McVay and sometimes pulling his head coach out of the way when referees or game action would come too close. Both McVay and Rath were interviewed for a profile piece called \\"The Art of the Get Back Coach,\\" which was aired on NFL Films Presents in January 2019. The clip went viral and has been viewed more than 3.5 million times. From January to July 2019, Rath was placed on leave by the Rams organization. =Philadelphia Eagles (2020–present)= On February 7, 2020 the Eagles announced the hiring of Rath as the team’s director of sports performance. Personal life Rath is married and has three children. =2019 battery case= On January 15, 2019, Rath was arrested on suspicion of sexual battery, and was then placed on leave by the Rams organization. He did not accompany the Rams for either their NFC Championship Game victory at New Orleans Saints or to Atlanta, Georgia for Super Bowl LIII against New England Patriots. During the playoffs, the team explained his absence by saying he was recovering from a medical procedure. Said McVay during Super Bowl Week, \\"It's tough because he's such a great competitor and he's so instrumental in us getting here...We love him. I know the players and coaches miss him when he's not here with us, but he's with us in spirit. He's done a great job of helping us get to this point and he knows that.\\" McVay also added that Rath had helped the team with input on the players scheduling and conditioning during the runup to the game. On March 15, the Ventura County District Attorney announced that Rath was being charged with three counts of misdemeanor sexual battery, to which Rath's attorney issued a plea of not guilty. The charges resulted from an incident in Moorpark, California that occurred in June 2018 involving a female acquaintance. When the charges were made public, the Rams organization released a statement that said, \\"we are aware of the charges filed against Ted Rath. We take these allegations very seriously. Once the charges were filed, we decided Ted would take a leave of absence from the team as this matter works its way through the justice system.\\" Additionally, a statement was issued to the Associated Press by Rath's attorney, Vicki Podberesky, that read, \\"Mr. Rath takes these allegations very seriously...Ted is a man who has led a law-abiding life. He is a husband, a father and a dedicated family man. He has the utmost respect for women and would never intentionally act in a manner that was demeaning or otherwise inappropriate. We intend to defend this matter to the fullest extent possible in a court of law, and we believe that after there has been a full vetting of the facts of this case Mr. Rath will be shown to be not guilty of these charges.\\" Rath's trial was set to begin on May 31, but proceedings did not ultimately start until July 6, 2019. During the trial, Rath's attorneys argued that he had consumed alcohol for the first time since experiencing a stroke-related event in May 2018 and that, combined with medication he was taking at the time, could not have formed any criminal intent from which he touched the plaintiff inappropriately. A taped telephone conversation between the plaintiff and Rath, done as part of the criminal investigation, was played in which the plaintiff talked to Rath about the incident at her house and asks for clarification about why he was in her room and why he touched her. Rath expressed shock at the allegation, responding that he had no recollection of any such incident while also apologizing several times for anything that might have occurred. The case was adjudicated over the course of six days, during which former Rams defensive end Ndamukong Suh testified on Rath's behalf. On July 12, 2019, the jury reached its verdict after one hour of deliberation, finding Rath not guilty on all three counts. Soon after, Rath was reinstated by the Rams organization and rejoined the team at training camp at UC Irvine. McVay commented on Rath's return, stating, \\"I think it was certainly a good learning experience for all of us, and for Ted especially.\\" Rath later resumed his duties with the team.

Perched on one of the easternmost spurs of the Greater Caucasus crest, the monastery is part of the larger historic site of Nekresi, once a flourishing town of the Late Antiquity. In medieval Georgian literary tradition, beginnings of monasticism at Nekresi is associated with the 6th-century monk Abibos, known for Christian proselytizing and combating Zoroastrianism. The monastery was closed down shortly after the Imperial Russian takeover of the Georgian church in 1811. After a hiatus of nearly two centuries, the monastery became functional again in 2000. The Nekresi monastery tops a wooded hillock known as Nazvrevi Gora (literally, \\"a hill of former vineyards\\") in the eastern portion of the Nekresi site, some 3.7 km east as the crow flies from the modern village of Shilda, Qvareli Municipality. It is a complex of buildings, including the three-church basilica of the Dormition of the Mother of God, a mortuary chapel—both dated to the 6th century, a centrally-planned church of the Archangel Michael built in the 8th or 9th century, and a bishop's palace of the 9th century, as well as a 12th-century refectory, a 16th-century defensive tower, and remains of storehouses and other accessory structures. The complex is inscribed on the list of the Immovable Cultural Monuments of National Significance of Georgia.  History  Tinatin and son Alexander, on a 16th- century fresco from the Nekresi church of the Dormition. The Nekresi monastery was founded in the 6th century; an earlier dominant view that the first church of the complex was built on the place of a Zoroastrian shrine in the 4th century has been disproved by archaeological excavations, which found no evidence of any occupation on the hill earlier than the 6th century. That period saw an upsurge in monasticism in eastern Georgia, popularized by the Thirteen Assyrian Fathers, a group of monks who are credited by the medieval Georgian literary tradition with founding several monasteries across the country. One of these men, St. Abibos, based at Nekresi, preached Christianity among the mountaineers east of the Aragvi and fought Zoroastrian influences—on one occasion quenching a sacred flame with water—until being captured and put to death. Although much of Nekresi's medieval history is undocumented by records and written evidence, archaeology and architectural analysis testify to an extensive building activity at the monastery complex in the 9th century even as the town of Nekresi was in an irreversible decline. The monastery, further, functioned as the seat of a Georgian bishop, entitled as Nekreseli. St. Abibos is traditionally regarded as the first bishop of Nekresi; no other local bishop is known by name until . The establishment saw its defensive structures fortified during the relatively stable reigns of successive kings of Kakheti, Leon (r. 1518–1574) and Alexander II (r. 1574–1605). Subsequent turmoils and incessant marauding raids from the neighboring tribes of Dagestan compelled the bishop to transfer his see from the monastery to the relative security of the church of the Mother of God in the nearby village of Shilda in 1785. Shortly after the Imperial Russian takeover of the Georgian church in 1811, the diocese of Nekresi was abolished, followed by the dissolution of the convent itself. Both were restored in modern Georgia after the fall of the Soviet Union: the former bishopric was reconstituted as the Eparchy of Nekresi within the Georgian Orthodox Church in 1995 and the monastery became repopulated by monks in 2000. From 2008 to 2010, the entire complex underwent systematic archaeological exploration and substantial renovation.  Layout  = Mortuary chapel = The mortuary chapel is the oldest extant structure in the Nekresi monastery complex, with the area of four square metres. A long- established belief that it was a proto-basilica built on the place of a former Zoroastrian temple in the late 4th century—and, thus, one of the oldest Christian churches in Georgia—was disproved the 2008–2009 archaeological study which found no evidence of pre-Christian occupation at the site and redated the structure to the 6th century. The chapel is a hall building, with a miniature horseshoe-shaped sanctuary on the east. It has entrances on the north, south and east sides and is open to the elements on all sides. The structure has a vaulted crypt under the main floor that was used for burials suggesting that the building was built as a mortuary chapel. = Church of the Dormition = South façade of the Church of the Dormition. The church of the Dormition of the Mother of God, standing south of the mortuary chapel, is dated to the 6th or 7th century. It is built of rubble and measures 17.2 x 12.7 metres. It belongs to a type of church building known in Georgia as a three-church basilica, in which the central nave and two side aisles are separated by solid walls. In the Nekresi church, the narthex on the west side opens onto all three aisles. The central nave terminates in a deep sanctuary apse on the east, which is flanked by the rectangular pastophoria on its either side. The side naves also end in apses. The north aisle communicates with the central nave through a door, but the corresponding door on the south aisles seems to have been blocked up centuries ago as the 16th-century frescoes now cover that area. The north and south aisles are open to the exterior with arcades of two arches. The interior of the church is adorned with frescoes commissioned by King Leon of Kakheti in the middle of the 16th century. The king, with his family, is depicted in the western portion of the south wall. The paintings bear an influence of the late Byzantine Paleologian art. = Church of the Archangel = Church of the Archangel. The church of the Archangel is an 8th–9th-century building situated in the south-western portion of the Nekresi monastery complex. Built of rubble with the additional use of limestone slabs, it is a centrally-planned church, with transitional features of a domed three-church basilica. It has two apsed side aisles to the north and south of the central nave. The latter terminates in a pentagonal sanctuary apse which is pierced by a single window. A window in the north aisle is sealed. The south aisle and the narthex in the west both are open to the exterior through two-arched arcades. Transition from the central square to the circle of the dome is effected by two squinchs to the west and proto- pendentives to the east. The drum of the dome has windows to the east, south and west. The interior of the central part of the church bears now barely discernable traces of frescoes. About 25 metres northeast of the church, on a terraced slope, a number of monks' cells have been uncovered. = Bishop's palace and other structures = Parts of the monastery complex: the bishop's palace (right), mortuary chapel (left), refectory (left, foreground), and tower (right, background). The bishop's palace is a two-storey building, standing a few metres southwest of the church of the Dormition. The windows on both floors have sharply defined horseshoe-shaped arches, an architectural element not in use in Georgia after the 9th–10th century. The rooms are arranged in an enfilade. The ground floor is almost completely occupied by a wine cellar, with a large rectangular stone winepress in its northern part and a number of wine-jars (kvevri) buried underground. The ceiling is supported by an octagonal column in the centre. A two-flight staircase leads up to a terrace, which then continues into the main chamber of the upper floor. The building was roofed by wooden beams supporting terracotta tiles. To the east, the palace is adjoined by a one-story vaulted building thought to have been a refectory on account of its location next to the wine cellar. Adjacent to the north wall is a three-storey defensive tower built in the 16th century. It is built upon an earlier rectangular structure with a water reservoir and is equipped with embrasures. Its uppermost floor, with larger openings, was also used as a belfry.

It is located on the western side of the grounds of Lincoln Castle and is a Grade II* listed building. History Court hearings have taken place within the grounds of Lincoln Castle since the castle was built in the 11th century. A medieval shirehall on the site was demolished and replaced by a new county hall in 1776. After finding that the 18th century county hall was subsiding due to a mixture of local quarrying and poor construction, the justices ordered its demolition using prison labour and the commissioning of a new facility on the same site. The current building, which was designed by Sir Robert Smirke in the Gothic style and built at a cost of £40,000, was completed in 1823. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage with thirteen bays facing the east gate of the castle; the central section of three bays featured an arched doorway with a triple Gothic window on the first floor; the roof was crenellated and there were octagonal corner turrets. Internally, the principal rooms in the building were the two courtrooms, one for hearing criminal cases and the other for hearing civil cases, both approximately square, decorated with wainscot panelling and located on the first floor. There was also a grand jury room containing an ornate fireplace guarded by lions bearing shields. In March 1872 the courthouse was the venue for the trial and conviction of William Frederick Horry, accused of murdering his wife: Horry became the first person to be executed in the UK using the \\"long drop\\" method of execution, a technique developed by William Marwood which was faster and therefore considered more humane than the previous method, and which was subsequently universally used. The building continued to be used as a facility for dispensing justice but, following the implementation of the Local Government Act 1888, which established county councils in every county, it also became the meeting place of Lindsey County Council. After the County Council moved to County Offices, Lincoln in 1932, the building was retained for the assize courts and, since 1972, for the Crown Court. In the early 21st century Her Majesty's Courts Service announced proposals to move the Crown Court out of the castle grounds: this scheme was abandoned on the basis that it would not be value for money in November 2010. The idea of re- locating the Crown Court, possibly to the magistrates court building on the High Street, was briefly resurrected again but not progressed in March 2014.

Biography Hayllar was born in London and was the eldest daughter of the nine children born to Ellen Phoebe Cavell (1827-1899) and her husband James Hayllar (1829-1920). The family lived at Mecklenburgh Square in London and also rented a country house in Suffolk for several months each year before moving to a large house, Castle Priory, by the Thames at Wallingford, then in Berkshire. Hayllar and her four sisters attended a day school in Gower Street and all were given art lessons by their father, who was himself a well-regarded painter. Jessica Hayllar became the most prolific artist among the Hayllar offspring, although her sister Edith also achieved some recognition. Jessica Hayllar exhibited at the Royal Academy in London regularly between 1879 and 1915 and also had works shown at the Society of British Artists, with the Institute of Painters in Oil Colours and at the Royal Manchester Institution. She often painted domestic scenes, local villagers and depicted family occasions and gatherings. Windows and doorways were another frequent theme in her work. Ill health as a result of being knocked down by a carriage in 1900 greatly reduced her output in her later years when she was living in Bournemouth with her father. In her final years she mostly concentrated on painting flower pieces.

How new fact boxes are explaining medical risk to millions. BMJ: British Medical Journal, 357:j2460. doi:10.1136/bmj.j2460 Fact box: Main features There are several key features of a fact box. First, a summary statement describes the benefits and harms of a medical treatment without giving an explicit recommendation about which option is optimal for the reader. To avoid any ambiguities in interpreting the content, explicit and exhaustive information about the target population (e.g. gender, age range), date or time span of data collection and all additional information that may have an influence on the understanding of the reported facts are presented. To inform the user about the most important benefits and harms, these are stated explicitly, preferably as a list of statements or questions. Moreover, a fact box presents comparisons of outcomes, usually between treatment and control groups, which are based on research results (preferably meta-analyses or systematic reviews, or randomized controlled trials). To promote a good understanding of the results, an effect measure for each group should be provided in terms of frequencies, i.e. absolute numbers out of a given sample size of, e.g., 100 or 1000 cases. To report the current state of scientific evidence, for continuous measurements common descriptive statistics like mean, mean difference or median should be presented; in case of unquantifiable outcomes the evidence can be described in a statement. Finally, sources for all information have to be listed and a date when the material was assembled or updated needs to be provided.

It was a fortress of the local Ii clan, which later rose to prominence under the Edo period Tokugawa shogunate. The site has been protected by the central government as a National Historic Site since 1944. Background Mitake Castle is located at the top of a 400-meter hill northeast of the Iinoya valley in former Tōtōmi Province, overlooking Lake Hamana to the south and the modern city of Hamamatsu in the distance. In Iinoya valley was an important communications route between eastern and western Japan, and was thus involved in many conflicts throughout history. The inner bailey of the castle is a round area approximately 50 meters in diameter, which is divided into several kuruwa enclosures. The western slope is protected by an earthen rampart 150 meters in length, which is reinforced in places by rock. There is a secondary enclosure on the eastern ridge of the mountain, measuring 200 meters, which may have been used as an encampment, although it has no clear defenses, other than a dry moat at one end. A third enclosure is located halfway up the mountain, and has a well. The presence of a Shinto shrine also indicates that this was the location of the palace of Prince Muneyoshi during his brief stay at the castle during the Nanboku-chō period.  History  It is not certain when Mitake Castle was constructed, but per local legend it began as a fortified Buddhist temple around 1336 AD. The Ii clan lived at Iinoya Castle in the valley, and used Mitake Castle on the mountain as a final redoubt in time of war. The origins of the Ii clan are also uncertain, but they were already in control of this area since the late Heian period and were in the service of Minamoto no Yoritomo during the Kamakura period. Following the establishment of the Muromachi shogunate, the Ii clan sided with the Southern Court under Emperor Go-Daigo against Ashikaga Takauji. Prince Muneyoshi, the son of Emperor Go-Daigo, initially rallied his forces from Iinoya valley, around which time Mitake Castle was built. However, after he was driven into Shinano Province by the Ashikaga and Mitake Castle was captured in 1339, the Ii clan switched allegiance to the Northern Court and the Ashikaga shogunate. Later, the castle was used by Shiba Yoshitatsu to defeat Asahina Yasutomo, a vassal of the Imagawa clan in 1514. This was the last record it was used as a fortress. During the many wars of Imagawa Yoshimoto, the Ii clan fought in the vanguard of the Imagawa army and suffered many casualties, including its clan leadership. Mitake Castle itself was seized from the Ii clan after the start of the rebellion of Tokugawa Ieyasu for independence from the Imagawa, and the Imagawa rebuilt its fortifications. However, under Ii Naotora and Ii Naomasa, the clan defected to the Tokugawa side and was able to recover Mitake Castle by 1573. In 1590, when Toyotomi Hideyoshi transferred Tokugawa Ieyasu to the Kanto region, the Ii clan accompanied him to his new domains, and Mitake Castle was abandoned around this time. Today, no structures remain of the castle.

The film features Mithun Tejasvi, Aparna Pillai, Anumol and Yugendran in lead roles, with Sarath Babu, Shanmugarajan, Singamuthu, Halwa Vasu, Crane Manohar, Scissor Manohar, and Muthukaalai playing supporting roles. The film was produced by SPS and Selvaraaja. It had musical score by Ilaiyaraaja, cinematography by Naga Saravanan, and editing by Peter Babiya. The film was released on 25 September 2009. Plot The film is narrated in a nonlinear plot. In 1993, in Srivilliputhur, Raghu and Dhanasekhar were schoolmates and best friends. Dhanasekhar lived with his parents and little sister Bharathi, while Raghu lived with his bedridden mother. One day, Raghu's mother died, and his uncle had to take care of him. Thereafter, Raghu had a riding accident because of Dhanasekhar and lost his vision in the process. The school teacher and Father, Joseph Aruldoss (Sarath Babu), who was also Raghu's mentor, enrolled him in a special school. Dhanasekhar's father then got a transfer in a new city, but before leaving Srivilliputhur, Dhanasekhar met the blind Raghu and said goodbye to him. Afterwards, Joseph Aruldoss taught Raghu to play the violin. The years passed, and Raghu (Mithun Tejasvi) has his sight back. In Chennai, Raghu is now a reputed violinist in the cinema industry. He is married to the talkative Gayathri (Aparna Pillai), and they have a daughter Bharathi (Raghavi). Gayathri spends her time scolding her husband Raghu for his sudden strange silence. Raghu has sent hundreds of letters to Bharathi, but the letters never reached her. One day, the restraint Raghu suddenly packs his bags and leaves home, leaving his wife in shock. He takes a bus to Kanyakumari. A few years ago, in Kanyakumari, the blind Raghu found Dhanasekhar (Yugendran) and his sister Bharathi (Anumol), who had just lost their parents. Bharathi developed a soft corner for Raghu and she eventually fell in love with him. Bharathi even encouraged Raghu who played the violin in the church to try his luck in cinema. Bharathi then told Dhanasekhar her wish to marry, and he accepted. One day, Dhanasekhar had a severe accident and died but not before telling Raghu that he donated his eyes to him. Persuaded by the pleas of Joseph Aruldoss and Bharathi, Raghu reluctantly accepted for the eye transplant. However, after the operation, Raghu mysteriously vanished, leaving his astounded lover Bharathi in tears. Back to the present, Gayathri finds out that Raghu was a blind person who can die at any moment due to the injury that he sustained in the past. Gayathri and her daughter Bharathi decide to go to Kanyakumari. Meanwhile, Raghu comes to Kanyakumari in search of Bharathi. However, he cannot find her and instead meets Joseph Aruldoss at the church. An angry Joseph Aruldoss scolds him for betraying the poor Bharathi. Raghu explains to him that after the operation, he had a part of Dhanasekhar in him and could not marry Bharathi, who also became his sister in the process. Raghu also tells him that he feels guilty of what he did and cannot live any longer without apologizing to Bharathi. When Raghu finally sees Gayathri in a nun's dress, he faints and dies. Gayathri and her daughter then come to church and mourn the death of Raghu. The film ends with the newly widowed Gayathri writing a letter to Bharathi.

Suspicion points to the butler, Jason, to whom Wareing had shown the necklace the night before. Wareing's daughter, Florence, is also a suspect and therefore denied her father's estate. Over the course of the investigation, Wareing's daughter Florence works with a little girl named Mary (Aida Horton) who lives with a professional burglar named Bill, another suspect. Dr. Barton, the family's physician, arranges a séance to identify the murderer. When Barton sees the ghost of Wareing, he betrays his own guild and is arrested. The Wareing estate is returned to Florence, who marries Stanley Carter, an attorney at her father's bank.  Release  Luring Shadow was released in October 1921. After an initial theatrical release, the film was shown at various Catholic churches as an examination of the legitimacy of spiritualism.  Reception  The Edwardsville [Illinois] Intelligencer applauded the film's attempts to disprove spiritualism, which had a growing following the carnage of World War I. The paper's wrote that: > People the world over are duped and deceived by spiritualists, who pretend > to possess the secret of obtaining communication with the spirits of the > dead. Luring Shadows gives inside information on the nature and identity of > these so-called spirits; it shows how people are deceived. Some people pay > fancy sums to learn from personal experience how deceitful Spiritualism is. > You can save the fancy sum and learn the lesson just as well by seeing the > Luring Shadows...

The Jenet-Roetter House was designated as a Dayton Historic Landmark in 2019 after receiving unanimous votes by the city's Landmarks Commission, Plan Board, and Mayor/Commission. The Jenet-Roetter House at 148 Squirrel Road in the Five Oaks District of Dayton, Ohio is a private home known as a notable example of Prairie School architecture made popular by famous American architect Frank Lloyd Wright. It was designed by Dayton's architectural firm, Schenck and Williams, who also designed the Wright Brothers home Hawthorn Hill, which is a National Historic Landmark open to the public.

Pages 2-3. https://www.daytonohio.gov/AgendaCenter/ViewFile/Minutes/_08212019-643 According to research by writer and academic librarian Andrew WalshAbout Andrew J. Walsh. https://andrewjwalsh.com/about-me, author of \\"Lost Dayton\\" and the Dayton Vistas blog, Carrie E. Jenet was born circa 1861 in Illinois to German parents. She is recorded as acquiring the 8,735 square foot lot in 1911. Carrie Jenet and her sister Elizabeth Jenet were sisters-in-law to the head of household William J. Roetter. Roetter spent 47 years as a buyer for the linen and white goods department of the Rike-Kumler Co. and was also a Mason and member of the First Lutheran Church. It is likely that Roetter made a significant financial contribution to purchase the lot for $1,200, hire the architectural firm of Schenck and Williams, and construct the house for $7,500. A garage was later added at a cost of about $300. A 1917 \\"Dayton Herald\\" article identified Carrie Jenet as a “modiste,” or dressmaker, who dealt in high-end fashion by “enchanting the color, style, and fabric of garments.” She traveled to Cuba, Panama, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina, Brazil and the Barbados for her business. She never married and died on July 5, 1938. According to Walsh, the researcher, in the 1950s the house was owned by Charles W. Danis Sr. and his wife Elizabeth S. Danis. Charles Danis was chairman of the preeminent building and highway construction company Danis Industries, founded by his father B.G. Danis. His company was the contractor for many buildings in the region and in Dayton, including several designed by Schenck and Williams, such as Hawthorn Hill and the Engineers Club of Dayton. He received the Spirit of America Heritage Award in 1975 from Junior Achievement of Dayton and Miami Valley at a dinner attended by 1,200, according to a page-21 article in The Journal Herald on May 1, 1975. He retired from the company in 1983 and died in 1996 at the age of 80. According to an Aug. 5, 2003 Dayton Daily News page-10 article by Sean Strader, Elizabeth Danis, a teacher for many years, was a member of the Dayton Catholic Women’s Club, Dayton Garden Club, and the Dayton Women’s Club. She died in 2003 at the age of 85. In the 1970s, according to researcher Walsh, the house was owned by John H. Dirck. Dirck was assistant vice president of data processing programming at Citizens Federal Savings and Loan Association. A 1987 Dayton Daily News article said he performed on weekends in the Columbus area with Columbus WCMH-TV Channel 4 newscaster Joe Dirck in a group called The Pink Flamingoes. The house has 11 rooms, which include five bedrooms and three bathrooms, a great room with a large fireplace, an office with built-in book shelves, a dining room with built-in display and storage cabinets, a breakfast room, a sunroom, and a full kitchen with a butler's nook. The house had a number of owners over the years, fell into disrepair, was cosmetically rehabbed by house flippers who purchased it after foreclosure, and today is owned by Steven and Mary Solomon. Due to the restoration efforts of the Solomons, the house was selected by Preservation Dayton Inc. for its Excellence in Historic Preservation Award in 2020.

The Byzantine generals led by Martin, who had just assassinated the Byzantine ally King Gubazes II of Lazica, wanted to gain a quick and easy victory in the battlefield to divert attention. They commenced a full-scale assault on the new Persian fort at Onoguris, which was near the main Byzantine stronghold Archaeopolis. The unexpected arrival of a small relief force under the new Persian commander Nachoragan turned the tide of the battle and resulted in an easy victory for the Persians instead. The Byzantines subsequently abandoned their base at Archaeopolis also, which was then destroyed by the Persians who now gained the momentum. Background After succeeding in dislodging the Byzantines from Telephis–Ollaria, the Persian commander in Lazica, Mihr-Mihroe, did not follow up the victory, but returned to Mocheresis and reinforced the Persian garrison at Onoguris on his way. The latter was near Archaeopolis, the main Byzantine stronghold in the region. Mihr-Mihroe died shortly afterward and was succeeded by Nachoragan. After the defeat at Telephis, King Gubazes II of Lazica sent a complaint against the Byzantine generals to Emperor Justinian I, who then sent General Bessas into exile. Martin and Rusticus, two other generals criticized by Gubazes, then assassinated the Lazic king. This resulted in confusion among the Lazi who abandoned their support for the Byzantines. Martin immediately prepared a large force to capture the nearby Persian fort at Onoguris, expecting an easy victory. According to Agathias, Martin and those behind the assassination of the Lazic king wanted to gain a success which could defuse a volatile situation in case Emperor Justinian I would notice their culpability. The siege In 554 or 555, the Byzantine force of 50,000 fighting men under Martin besieged the Persian fort of Onoguris using wicker roofs (spaliones), ballistae, and other siege equipment. A captured Persian revealed the approach of a Persian relief force from Mocheresis and Cutais under Nachoragan. The idea of a full-scale attack against the force was rejected; instead, a 600-strong force, under Dabragezas and Usigardus, was sent to ambush the relief force, while the main Byzantine force engaged in the siege. Agathias describes the siege to be \\"more like a pitched battle\\". The Persian relief force (or a vanguard?) was caught off-guard and was routed, but as the Persians, an all-cavalry force numbering 3,000, noted that it was not the main Byzantine force, the Persians turned against them and routed the pursuers. As both parties reached the Byzantine line, the main Byzantine force was seized with panic and fled together with their commanders. The Persian garrison then sallied and further contributed to the Byzantines' wavering. As the Byzantine cavalry fled, the infantry was left behind, and the narrowness of the bridge over the Catharus River further hampered their flight, many of them being killed in the subsequent stampede. Bouzes and his cavalry noticed the situation, returned, covered their retreat, and prevented their total annihilation. As the pursuing Persians reached Archaeopolis, they found the plain abandoned; thus they dismantled the Byzantine fortifications, looted their camp, and returned. pages=72-75}} See also *Zhayedan References Category:Lazic War Category:554 Category:550s conflicts Category:6th century in Georgia (country) Onoguris Category:550s in the Byzantine Empire Category:6th century in Iran Onoguris Onoguris ","title":"Siege of Onoguris"},{"id":"61736060","text":"Raidell de Pree (born 17 November 1997) is a Dutch professional basketball player for Feyenoord Basketball of the Dutch Basketball League (DBL).

The following incidents occurred during 1993: * 1993 On March 28, a 36-inch Colonial Pipeline Company petroleum products pipeline ruptured near Herndon, Virginia. The rupture created a geyser which sprayed diesel fuel over into the air, coating overhead power lines and adjacent trees, and mist covering adjacent Virginia Electric Power Company buildings. The diesel fuel spewed from the rupture into an adjacent storm water management pond and flowed overland and through a network of storm sewer pipes before reaching Sugarland Run Creek, a tributary of the Potomac River. The cause was latent third party damage. About 400,000 gallons of diesel were lost. * 1993 On April 6, a 16-inch crude oil pipeline ruptured, spilling up to 125,000 gallons of crude oil into a stream bed in Kern County, California, forcing a temporary closure of the nearby Golden State Freeway. * 1993 A fire at Transco/Williams Companies gas compressor station, in Billingsley, Alabama, on June 3 injured one worker. The cause was from equipment failure. * 1993 On June 9, a cinder block duplex in Cliffwood Beach, New Jersey, exploded as a New Jersey Natural Gas Company (NJNG) contractor was trenching in front of the building. The gas explosion killed 3 residents of the duplex, and seriously injured 3 others. * 1993 On June 24, a Tennessee Gas Pipeline line failed just next to a gas compressor station in West Monroe, Louisiana, causing a massive fire that forced evacuations of homes & businesses with in a mile of the failure. Internal corrosion of the pipeline was the cause. * 1993 On July 22, a city of St. Paul Department of Public Works backhoe hooked and pulled apart a Northern States Power Company (NSP) high-pressure gas service line in St. Paul, Minnesota. An explosion and natural gas-fueled fire resulted about 20 minutes after the backhoe hooked the service line. The explosion force caused part of the building to land on and flatten an automobile traveling southwest on East Third Street, and the driver died instantly. The explosion and ensuing fire also killed an apartment occupant and a person outside the building and injured 12 people. * 1993 On July 26, a 6-inch pipeline in Nebraska was exposed by scour in a creek bed and its banks, and was struck by flood debris, which caused it to rupture. The rupture resulted in the release of of anhydrous ammonia * 1993 An ammonia pipeline failed in Sperry, Oklahoma on August 20. 80 homes in the area were evacuated. Several people were treated for ammonia inhalation injuries. * 1993 A trencher being used in golf course construction hit a petroleum productions pipeline in Berwick Township, Pennsylvania on September 2, causing a leak of about 26,250 gallons of gasoline. There were no injuries. * 1993 On September 15, an 8-inch NORCO Pipeline Co. line ruptured in east Indiana, just west of Edgerton, Ohio, spilling about 30,000 gallons of diesel fuel. There was a 4 foot long rupture in the pipeline, and some of the diesel entered Fish Creek, killing wildlife. The rupture was caused by pumping against a closed valve. Later, NORCO and ARCO agreed to pay $2.8 million for the spill in US District Court. * 1993 On November 3, Amoco Pipeline was fined $12,500 for a 1971 pipeline leak that contaminated a drinking well and caused other pollution problems for people living near Garfield, Minnesota. * 1993 On December 2, a 10-inch Conoco pipeline ruptured, spilling of gasoline into a creek in Washington, Missouri. * 1993 On December 8, a Sunoco pipeline was detected to be leaking by pressure loss, but, it took several days to find the leak point in Upper Leacock Township, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. About 2,369 barrels of transmix were lost. The cause was from a backhoe hitting the pipeline in a cornfield. * 1993 An explosion and fire on a gas transmission pipeline on December 20, near Mellen, Wisconsin, cut off the gas supply to 3,500 customers in the area. * 1993 In Ventura County, California, on December 22, a leak occurred from a crude oil pipeline. This spill released an estimated 92,000 gallons of crude oil. The oil flowed through a culvert, traveled through 150 feet of woodland and brush, to McGrath Creek, then flowed another 1,200 feet into McGrath Lake.

Synopsis  Roma refugees had settled in a makeshift village named Barupra in Bosnia, on the outskirts of an abandoned coal mine. The novel opens in March 2015 with the testimony of Ferko Rincic, sole survivor of the massacre, before the ICC. Rincic testifies that Chetniks had come on the night of April 27, 2004, forcing the Roma onto trucks at gunpoint while he was hiding in an outhouse; according to Rincic, the evacuated Roma were then gathered into an old coal excavation and explosive charges were detonated, burying the entire village within. In January 2015, Bill ten Boom decided to retire from his lucrative private practice and accept a position with the ICC at the request of his colleague from law school, Roger Clewey. In retrospect, ten Boom sees it as the last step in divorcing his life and career from the fictional Kindle County; the majority of the story is set in European locations including The Hague and Bosnia. Because the Roma had tipped American forces to the location of Laza Kajevic, a wanted war criminal, just prior to the massacre, one potential motive for the crime would have been retaliation for the unsuccessful capture attempt. However, Rincic's testimony, which included a detail that the Chetniks spoke Bosnian with a foreign accent, pointed towards the potential involvement of nearby American troops. The sensitive political situation and the United States' withdrawal from the ICC (under the American Service-Members' Protection Act) meant that an investigation led by an American prosecutor would be acceptable, leading to the selection of ten Boom. The remainder of the novel details the legal maneuvering in the ICC, forensic investigation by ten Boom and his chief investigator, an ex-Belgian police officer named Goos, and ten Boom's personal life over the next few months. Reception Reviewing for The Guardian, Steven Poole wrote \\"the book ... is expertly handled.

The National Forest evacuated the Taboose and Tinnemaha Creek campgrounds, both which were used by fire crews as bases. By the evening, the fire was 30 percent contained. The next morning, on September 6, Taboose Creek Campground was reopened. Over the weekend, high winds caused spot fires, increasing the size of the fire to by the morning of Sunday, September 8. Containment was at 10 percent. Despite reopening three days prior, Taboose Creek Campground was placed under evacuation advisory. Tinnemaha Road was closed. Three park trails were closed, including trails that pass through Sequoia National Park and Kings Canyon National Park. By the evening, the fire was reported at after aircraft were able to map the fire's footprint. Air tankers and helicopters began dropping fire retardant and water. Four vehicles were destroyed in the fire at the Red Lake Trailhead. Baxter Ranch was put under mandatory evacuation and more roads were closed in the surrounding area. Hikers were evacuated at Red Lake using helicopters. On September 9, more campgrounds were closed. On the morning of September 10, Unified Command reported that the fire has burned , despite original estimates that it had burned over . That evening, select areas were opened to the public, no longer under mandatory evacuation. As of September 11, the fire was 47 percent contained. The fire began burning in John Muir Wilderness. Firefighters began working with the National Forest to begin clean up processes, including fire suppression and rehab and damage mitigation. A Fire Weather Watch has been put in place by the National Weather Service due to dry, windy conditions anticipated for the weekend. As of October 7, Taboose Creek Campground was closed and the fire had burned and was 75 percent contained. Evacuations and closures Fire crews from Stanislaus County were onsite to fight the fire. On September 18, mandatory evacuations remained in place for Baxter Ranch. The following roads were closed: Tinemaha Road, Taboose Creek Road at Aberdeen, Birch Creek Road, McMurry Meadows Road, Goodale Road, and Goodale Creek Road. The Birch Creek Trail, Red Lake Trail, and Taboose Creek Trails were closed. The following campgrounds were closed: Goodale Creek, Taboose Creek and Tinnemaha Creek. Impact Firefighter looking out at burn scar The Taboose Fire caused trail, road and campground closures in Inyo National Forest, Sequoia National Park and Kings Canyon National Park. On September 8, the National Forest used helicopters to evacuate hikers on the Red Lake Trail and four vehicles were destroyed at the Red Lake Trailhead parking lot. The communities of Aberdeen and Birch Creek underwent mandatory evacuations.

Following the war, there was a great surge for education among women and to coincide with this, a great need for women to find paid employment. As the educational opportunity began involving women, illiteracy declined and women were able to attain education. Soon after, many women became newspaper editors and journalists and began being more heavily involved within the community and local and national politics. Women began increasing their efforts towards suffrage and influencing public policy. African American women were also heavily involved in suffrage and with their involvement in the Methodist Episcopal Church South and the Women's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU).  Education  Educational Publication Prior to the 1830s, women in the New England area began to have more opportunities to receive education due to changes in public policy. In 1840, literacy was nearly universal for women, with a one hundred percent increase from sixty years earlier. Women began receiving greater opportunities for education as seen through the expansion of free education, the professional training of teachers, and the organization of higher educational opportunities for women. Women received great opposition to educational opportunities during the late 18th and early 19th century as well, as women were only allowed to receive schooling during the summer period, prioritized enrollment in schooling for men, as well as the exclusion of females from grammar schools, teaching both Latin and Greek. In addition, women were often faced with beliefs in opposition to furthering their education, such as the universal belief at that time that women's brains were smaller in capacity and therefore inferior to the male brain. Vassar, Wellesley and Smith, and Bryn Mawr colleges were founded during the Reconstruction Era with the intent of creating greater opportunities for women in higher education. These women's colleges offered encouragement in scientific investigation, and tasks requiring patience and delicate manipulation—the work often thought of that men refused to do. Educational opportunities for women consisted of embroidery, painting, French, singing, and the playing of instruments. Though women were provided increased opportunities, they were often still seen as assistants and aid to men. In 1868, the Woman's infirmary Medical School was opened and began making innovations in the field of medicine. Education for African American varied to some degree. For many women they stopped at the primary grades. For African American women, education was difficult because they struggled with illiteracy, were seen as outsiders, and were needed for domestic labor to support their families. Between 1860 and 1910 the birthrate declined by one- third. The founding of the Mount Hermon Seminary in Mississippi in 1875 created an opportunity for African American women to receive a quality education. By 1890 only thirty Negro women had received college degrees.  Employment  Social change began taking place between 1780 and 1835, and as a result made shifts in women's patterns of work. The norm for adult women during this time remained household occupation. Leading up to the Reconstruction Era, the growth of school teaching became expansive and allowed women a non-domestic occupation. As populations grew in large cities, improvements in transportation were made, and markets focused on the consumer's needs began thriving, the importance of women's work within the home declined. In the 1860s, the number of children per white woman was just over five and by 1910 it had dropped to under three and a half. In 1870, two percent of office workers were women, and by 1920 that number had increased to 45 percent with 92 percent of stenographers; a large majority of individuals in these positions were native-born, white women. Though the birthrate began dropping, women began working in jobs uncommon ten years prior. The birthrate for African American women declined by one-third between 1860 and 1910. With their husbands away at war, women began working in retail establishments, manufacturing plants, and became plantation owners. Women's involvement in unions also begin increasing. The first two national unions to admit women to membership was the cigar makers in 1867 and the printers in 1869. Women participated in numerous unions throughout the country, including the Knights of Labor, American Federation of Labor, Working Women's Association, National Labor Union, Ironmolders Union, and countless others. They lead out in the shoemakers strike of 1860 and also took part in the bread riots that occurred in 1863 and 1864, causing high prices and food shortages. Women desiring to practice law also faced difficulty in that in 1873 citizenship did not confer the right to practice law. In 1874, the Illinois legislature passed legislator that provided that no one could be prevented from any occupation, profession or employment (except the military) on account of sex. Women factory workers were common in the mid-nineteenth century. From 1860 to 1870, women factory workers rose from 270,987 to 323,370, as thousands of women were forces into the labor market when the men went off to war.  Publishing  left Eliza Jane Poitevent, also known as Pearl Rivers, the owner of the New Orleans Picayune, along with other women such as Elia Good Byington, Mary Ann Thomas, Florence Williams, Addie McGrath, published papers primarily devoted to women's rights and were all very influential among the general public. The New Orleans Picayune published a series of opinions on the great number of women needing work and the conditions that Southern Women must face in the work place. Labor reform was often a topic of discussion among editorials. In 1866, a book entitled The Last Ninety Days of the War in North Carolina, by Cornelia Phillips Spencer, was published offering opinions of work allotted to women and their place in society. Her publication gained great popularity and her opinion began being sought by public officials throughout the state of North Carolina and by administrators at the University of North Carolina. Though it held little political influence, Louisa May Alcott's Little Women was published 1868 and had an influence among women challenging women's socialization into home life. In 1882, Elizabeth Stuart Phelps published a novel entitled, Doctor Zay and was a novel about women doctors of that period, with the intent to portray women as being able to \\"have it all\\", having both a successful career and marriage. Between 1870 and 1890 thirty-three suffrage periodicals existed. The Women's Journal, published in 1870 by Lucy Stone, was yet another way to achieve women advocacy and was a pathway for women to gain further support for suffrage movements. This periodical was said to have been the most influential of all the suffrage publishings as it had over thirty thousand readers by 1883.  Suffrage  alt= During the Civil War, women's rights movements had been pushed to the side. However, with the ending of the war and the start of Reconstruction, women began to advocate for their rights, and especially so for women's suffrage. On May 14, 1863 Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, women's rights activists, organized a meeting of \\"The Loyal Women of the Nation\\" located in New York. The meeting was held in support of the thirteenth amendment, knowing it would assist in the woman's desire and ability to vote. At the closing of the meeting, the National Woman's Loyal League was established and though the organization disbanded a little over a year later, the women were able to gather over 400,000 signatures in support of the thirteenth amendment. This organization allowed women to see the effect organizations could have and laid the foundation for many other suffrage and women organizations throughout the country. The congressional passage of the Enforcement Act in May 1870 to strengthen the Fifteenth Amendment was an opportunity for women to vote. With the intent to allow greater voting freedoms to citizens, women used it as their pathway to suffrage. Women took to the polls in groups, including a group of fifty women who attempted to vote with Susan B. Anthony. Women's attempts to register and to vote were usually denied, resulting in many women, including Virginia Minor and Ellen Van Valkenberg, suing election officials. During the late 1860s there were secret suffragists scattered throughout the south and following the end of the war began becoming vice-presidents of the Equal Rights Association in states such as Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, Florida and Tennessee. White women soon realized that in order to reconcile with the white in the South and work towards suffrage, they would need to abandon African American women efforts towards suffrage and equal rights. Victoria Woodhull Victoria Woodhull was a prominent figure in the women's suffrage movement during the 1870s and also an example of female political involvement within the United State. In 1870, pushing the limits of female citizenship, She announced her candidacy for president and was the first women to run for president. She advocated the importance of popular sovereignty, and argued that women were included in the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment as citizens. She asked to present before Congress in 1871 on women's suffrage, but was rejected by a majority vote. Despite her loss, Woodhull's presentation was significant in that she was the first woman to present before a congressional committee. Additionally, her presentation began spreading the interest in women suffrage beyond the average women, and her dedication made way for other women to become involved in politics, such as Mary Elizabeth Lease, and even mended the rivalry of two suffrage organizations and lead to the dedication of the National American Woman Suffrage Association. Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, the founders of the National Woman Suffrage Association and Lucy Stone and Julia Ward Howe, the founders of the American Woman Suffrage Association, though often at conflict with one another, were able to mend their disagreements due to Victoria Woodhull's great efforts. Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stantons's involvement in suffrage and politics, was seen through their countless efforts of speeches, publications, the founding of the National Woman Suffrage Association, as well as actions of civil disobedience seen by them wearing revealing dresses, demanding the right to vote at polls, participating in the Underground Railroad, and refusing to pay legal fees when they felt them unnecessary. These women's work paved the way for the passing of the 19th amendment and freedoms for women for years to come. Following Woodhull's, Anthony's, and Stanton's example, other women presented suffrage arguments in government, including Hannah Tracy Cutler and Margaret V. Longley presenting before the Kentucky legislature in 1872.thumb  African American women  = Church involvement = In the 1870s, Methodist, Baptist, and Presbyterian women all over the south, predominantly African American women, organized missionary societies that studied geography, raised money, and recruited individuals to travel globally in support of women empowerment. These missions acted as training schools for women's involvement in public life and a greater involvement in politics. In pursuit of greater women empowerment, women actively sought to preach and gain status within the Methodist Episcopal Church South and churches all throughout the south. Baptist and Methodist male leaders agreed that it was forbidden for women to act in leadership roles within the church and strongly opposed the action. Despite this opposition, with continued female persistence, in 1878 the Southern Methodist General Conference authorized the organization of a Women's Board of Foreign Missions, comprising 218 societies and 5,890 members. This society lead to tens of thousands of women involvement in school boards, hospitals and local city organizations all around the country. The progress of women's involvement within the Baptist and Methodist church lead to greater self-confidence and independence for women and was the foundation of the Women's club movement and subsequent club organizations and ultimately lead to political involvement within the United States for women. In addition to their efforts within the Baptist and Methodist church, one of the most successful organizations in rallying women together was that of Women's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU). Founded in 1874, the WCTU was one of the first organizations to welcome African American women in their efforts within the Temperance Movement. = Political involvement = African American women became politically involved during Reconstruction including: the establishment of Civic Improvement Leagues, the fight for abolition of child labor, involvement in prohibition, the pursuit of educational rights for women, and, critically, women's suffrage. While the right to vote was only given to black men, black women also took a part in voting and political activism. Voting was seen as a family matter, so often freedmen would not submit their ballots without their wives' approval and opinion. African American women additionally played a large role in organizations such as the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA) and the American Equal Right Association (AERA). Though they were heavily involved within the NWSA, clubwomen often distanced themselves from African American women due largely to influx of newcomers who had not been involved in the anti-slavery movement unlike their white predecessors. They attended political rallies and would show support for candidates or protest others, using their voices to impact public opinion. Many freedwomen even attended the polls. They would go with male family members to oversee how they voted, and some women attempted to vote themselves. In 1870, five black women were arrested for voting in South Carolina. The political activism of African American women, especially in the South, led to increased racial violence against them. Black women who took an interest in politics were at risk of violence from white men, and some were killed. Despite the violence they faced, Africa American women remained active in politics throughout the Reconstruction Era.  Southern women  Southern white women became increasingly involved in politics during Reconstruction. Women worked as liaisons between the Federal government and their male family members. Women would petition for husbands, sons, fathers, and brothers who were arrested for participation in the Confederacy or crimes committed against federal soldiers and freedmen. This led to Southern women gaining a deep knowledge of laws and political processes, unlike before when these women rarely played a role in issues outside of their homes. Women would go before the courts, and some even petitioned directly to President Andrew Johnson. They used strategies such as using their gender to play on the sympathy of men to free their family members. These women also supported white male efforts to disenfranchise freedmen. They saw black men gaining political power as a threat to their own political and physical security. When a male family member was charged for violence against freedmen, women would defend them by denying or reinterpreting the accusations against them. White women took up roles as the heads of their homes and kept them in order when fathers and husbands were arrested. By the turn of the century a large majority of southern women were employed.

The plant is a hyperaccumulator of nickel, with a concentration of the metal exceeding 16% in the plant's phloem sap. Distribution Phyllanthus balgooyi is found in perhumid equatorial rainforests in Palawan, Philippines and in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, with the plant preferring open habitats such as mountain ridges and river banks, where it could become dominant. Where it is found, P. balgooyi are typically isolated individuals. The soil where the species grows originated from serpentinised ultramafic bedrock, which is rich in metals such as nickel, cobalt and manganese. P. balgooyi is described as \\"widespread and locally common\\" in its habitat, in contrast to other Phyllanthus species which are typically restricted to several outcrops. The plant's earliest specimen was acquired in Palawan in 1886, though it was initially classified as a different species. It was first described in 2003, and was named after Dutch florist M.M.J. van Balgooy. Description The plant appears as monoecious shrubs or small trees ranging from 0.5 to 9 meters, with its trunk reaching up to 2.1 meters with a diameter of up to 25 cm. The bark is rough and greyish-brown, with the asymmetrical leaves being distichous numbering between 20 and 70 leaves per branchlet. P. balgooyi produces 3-lobed, capsular greenish-brown or greenish-yellow fruits. The size of P. balgooyi varies depending on location, with populations in the Philippines being shorter than 1.5 meters while a specimen in Sabah was recorded to be 9 meters high, and researchers have proposed the separation of the species into multiple subspecies depending on morphology and ecology. Typically, however, specimens appear as shrubs. =Bioaccumulation= The phloem sap of P. balgooyi. P. balgooyi is a hyperaccumulator of nickel, with the highest concentrations being found in the sap of its phloem. Nickel concentrations in the plant's phloem ranges up to 89 mg per gram, with the overall concentration foliar nickel concentration of up to 16 mg per gram. Its hyperaccumulating properties were first recorded in 1992, though the plant was then classified as P. palawanensis. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis showed that most of the nickel within the phloem sap is in form of nickel citrate. The increased nickel concentrations are primarily found in the phloem, with the plant's other organs containing considerably less nickel. Additionally, the plant also accumulated increased concentrations of cobalt and zinc, though not to the extent of nickel concentrations. The plant's sap is notable for being of a bright green color due to the high nickel content, with up to 16.9% nickel by weight and the sap is described as \\"one of the most unusual biological liquids\\". This figure is the second highest recorded concentration of nickel of any living material, behind a 25% figure for a Pycnandra acuminata sample from New Caledonia. Due to its bioaccumulation capabilities, P. balgooyi has been brought forward as a potential candidate for phytomining (i.e. extracting metals from plants), to be utilized in soils where the nickel concentration is too low for commercial mining operations. It was proposed that the accumulation of nickel to toxic levels was a defense mechanism against insects feeding on the sap, though Poaphilini moths have been observed to consume P. balgooyi leaves – the insects utilize the concentrated nickel for their own defensive mechanism against predators. P. balgooyi's shed leaves also increase the concentration of nickel in the topsoil surrounding the plant, benefiting its seedlings while increasing the difficulty for competing seedlings of non- hyperaccumulating plants.

He spent most of his life researching the antiquities of his home county, Leicestershire. Born in East Langton, Staveley attended Cambridge University from 1644 to 1654. Here he studied law, that being the profession he would later take on, serving as a Lancashire Justice of the peace. He was described by contemporaries as a just and even-tempered magistrate, but was most renowned for his manuscripts of Leicestershire history, which were instrumental in the later histories of John Nichols. Staveley published only one work in his lifetime, The Romish Horseleech (1674), a political tract protesting James II's Catholicism, later held up as a \\"no-Popery classic\\". Staveley died on 8 January 1684 in Friar Lane. Posthumously, two lesser-known historical treatises of Staveley were published, on the English monarchy and Church history, respectively. Early life and education Thomas Staveley was born to William Staveley (1596–1652), rector of Cossington, Leicestershire, and Anne (1605–1680), daughter of Thomas Babington of Rothley. He was born in East Langton, Leicestershire, sometime in November 1626, and was baptised on 26 November, in the parish church, Church Langton. He was brought up as the eldest of twelve siblings and was admitted to Emmanuel College, at Cambridge University, on 14 April 1644. Here he was admitted to the Inner Temple on 2 July 1647, and called to the bar on 12 June 1654. Legal career, antiquarianism and works Professionally, Staveley practised law, serving as part of the Leicester Quorum of Justices of the peace, even through the changes of Charles II's reign. In 1662, he succeeded his father-in-law, as steward to Leicester Corporation. Samuel Carte favourably records his jurisprudence, recalling he \\"was strictly just, abhorring all manner of fraud or bribery in his practice of the law, was very rarely observed to be in a passion\\". Staveley's main interest was the antiquarian research of the history of his home county. Much of his research survives in manuscript form (BL, Add. MS 15917; 'History of Leicester', ), and was incorporated into John Nichols' histories, The History and Antiquities of the County of Leicester (1795-1811; 8 vols.) and Bibliotheca Topographica Britannica (1780–90; 8 vols.). John Nichols duly commemorated him, in his Leicestershire history, as \\"a diligent, judicious, and faithful Antiquary\\". This research was also used in the posthumous publication of Staveley's The History of Churches in England (1712), a work published at a time of little interest in architectural history, and regarded by Adrian Green as one of the earliest antiquarians to realise buildings could be dated \\"from the Observation and View of the Fabrick it self\\" (as Staverley put it). Staveley's other historical work was Three Historical Essays (1703), posthumously published by his youngest son, George. The short treatise concerned (1) proving English claims to the French throne, while annulling Salic law; (2) the competition between the Houses of Lancaster and Plantagenet, alongside the Wars of the Roses; and (3) the successive unifications of Britain under Henry VII, James VI and I, and Charles II. Despite these interests, during his lifetime, Staveley's only published work was a religious tract: The Romish Horseleech: or an Impartial Account of the Intolerable Charge of Popery to this Nation (1674), the work \\"for which he is best known\\" according to the DNB, which protested the recent Catholic conversion of the heir presumptive, James II, the controversial Royal Declaration of Indulgence (1672), and the opposition to the Test Act (1673). The book was published anonymously, its incendiary title added by another author, and Staveley's short \\"Essay of the Supremacy of the King of England\\" appended to it. In 1768, the anti-Catholic Whig, Thomas Hollis, reprinted The Romish Horseleech as a \\"no-Popery classic\\", in order to fan the flames of his cause. He made sure the book would receive flattering reviews in the literary magazine, The Monthly Review, in order to have the maximum impact on the public. The assured review referred to the book as \\"calculated to excite, in the minds of men, a just abhorrence of the tyrannical usurpations and gross impositions of that church\\". The book was one of only two books Thomas Jefferson owned on the subject of Catholicism. Personal life In 1656, Thomas Staveley married Mary (d. 1669), the youngest daughter of John Onebye of Hinckley, in Belgrave, Leicester. Thomas and Mary had seven children, three sons: Thomas (d. 1676), William (1662–1723), and George (1665–1709); and four daughters: Mary (d. 1729), Anne (1663-1694), Christiana (b. 1667), Jane (1669-1705). William became an army captain, and converted to Catholicism, indifferent to his father's anti- Romanist legacy, and George became the rector of Medbourne. Staveley lived in Belgrave for nearly all his adult life, residing in the parsonage there, excluding the six or seven years before his death when he lived in Friar Lane, Leicester. In the later part of his life, he \\"acquired a melancholy habit\\", according to Nichols, and suffered from \\"the greatest pains which very severe fits of the gout exercised him\\", according to Carte. Staveley's wife, Mary, died in Belgrave, and was buried in St Peter's Church on the 12 October 1669. On 2 January 1684, Staveley died at his house in Friar Lane, buried soon after in the Church of St Mary de Castro on 8 January 1684. This burial was well attended, with the twenty-four aldermen and lord mayor of Leicester present for the solemn proceedings. In his will, Staverley left his house and lands in Leicester, a cottage and lands in Ilston on the Hill, and several smaller bequests of £400.

Its construction was ordered by Bernardo O'Higgins on 1818 as an act of thanksgiving to Our Lady of Mount Carmel for the intercession for the victory of the Chilean Army in the Battle of Maipú, where the Independence of Chile was assured. It's called Votive because of the votes (a kind of promise) that O'Higgins made for the Virgin Mary. History After its construction was decreed on May 7, 1818, on November 15 of the same year the first stone of the Victory Chapel or Votive Church of Maipú was laid and blessed. After 64 years of intermittent construction due to lack of resources, the old Church was solemnly inaugurated. But in 1906, a violent earthquake made the reconstruction of the temple necessary. On December 8, 1942, the Marian congress that was held in Santiago, took as the only agreement of this meeting to build a great sanctuary in Maipú, on the grounds of the old Chapel of Victory to honor Our Lady of Mount Carmel. This is how on July 16, 1948, the Archbishop of Santiago Monsignor José María Caro ordered the construction of the new sanctuary. During the long years of the construction of the current temple, Catholic groups such as Iglesia Joven or Clandestina, opposed it because they described it as a luxury, proposing to deliver the money invested in it to the poorest people, both of the Archdiocese of Santiago and the rest from the country. The work was delayed due to lack of resources but finally on October 24, 1974, and thanks to the O'Higgins National Vote Foundation (on which the Sanctuary depends today), the Votive Temple of Maipú was solemnly inaugurated. Initially, the project was conceived to transform this place into a large mausoleum where the remains of the Heroes of the Homeland and the most notable Chileans rest, similar to the Pantheon in Paris, but the Church opposed this initiative and preferred to transform it into a Shrine, dedicated exclusively to Catholic worship and spiritual care of pilgrims. On November 23, 1974, the Bishops of Chile, chaired by Cardinal Archbishop of Santiago Monsignor Raúl Silva Henríquez consecrated the temple. On October 26, 1984 the temple was declared historical monument by the Supreme Decree No. 645. On January 27, 1987, the temple was declared as Basilica. The image The image of Our Lady of Mount Carmel in the main altar The image of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, venerated in the Temple, is a sculpture of wood brought to Chile in 1785 by Martín de Lecuna for his oratory. The image was donated to the Cardinal Archbishop of Santiago, Mons. José María Caro by Mrs. Rosalía Mujica de Gutiérrez, a descendant of Don Martín de Lecuna, in August 1945. On April 3, 1987, the image was crowned as Queen and Patroness of Chile by Pope John Paul II when he was making an apostolic visit to Chile, ratifying the decree of Pope Pius XI in 1923 that granted such distinction. Viewpoint Just below the bell tower of the temple (63 m/206 ft high) there is a viewpoint. This space was inaugurated on April 3, 2012, coinciding with the twenty-fifth anniversary of the visit of John Paul II to Chile. With an area of 300 m²/3229 ft², this place offers a panoramic view of Santiago's southwest sector. It can be accessed by elevator or by a staircase of 323 steps. The viewpoint has audiovisual equipment to display informative content to visitors, in addition, inside there is a Compass rose that indicates the location of various Marian sanctuaries in the world.

AtB's task is to plan, order, market and develop public transport in the county. Tariffs are set by the county council as part of the budget process. AtB has three main sources of funding: Ticket revenues, grants from the Trøndelag County Municipality and the Environmental Package. AtB has a customer center at Prinsens Gate 41 right beside the bus stop Prinsens Gate P2 in Trondheim. AtB took over as public transport manager for bus traffic in Trondheim in 2010, tram traffic on Gråkallbanen and other bus traffic in Sør- Trøndelag in 2011, speedboat routes in 2012 and 2014, ferries in 2015, and in 2018, the former Nord-Trøndelag was also incorporated after the two counties was merged into the new county of Trøndelag. All operations are carried out on behalf of AtB by operating companies under contract with AtB. Bus traffic in the Trondheim area is carried out from 2019 on tendering contracts by Vy Buss, Tide Buss and Gråkallbanen. Expressboat and ferry traffic by Fosenlinjen FosenNamsos Sjø and Fjord1. while the tramway service is carried out by Gråkallbanen owned by Boreal. In the Regions around Trondheim Vy Buss, Trønderbilene and Boreal Buss are the operators. AtB also has taxi operators for School services, who are Trøndertaxi and Norgestaxi. History The company was established on September 15, 2009 under the temporary name Trøndelag public transport AS, while the final name AtB was presented on December 1, 2009. The company changed its formal name to AtB AS at the beginning of 2010. At 1 August 2010, AtB took over responsibility for managing the buses in Trondheim, which until then had been carried out by Team Trafikk, a Vy Buss subsidiary. On January 1, 2011, responsibility for the management of all other non-commercial bus traffic in Sør-Trøndelag and the tram on Gråkallbanen was taken over. The management responsibility for the boat service on the \\"Øyrekken\\" was taken over on January 1, 2012, while other fast boat traffic for example the service from Trondheim to Vanvikan, was taken on January 1, 2014 and ferry traffic on January 1, 2015. When the two Trøndelag counties were merged on January 1, 2018, AtB also assumed responsibility for public transport in the former Nord-Trøndelag. At the end of 2009, AtB signed an agreement with Swarco Norge AS on the delivery of a system for real-time information and signal prioritization in the Trondheim region (SISST). The system was put into operation in February 2011 with a display of 35 stops and signal priority in some traffic lights, while it was completed in 2013. In total, equipment was installed in approx. 260 buses, 100 stops and 45 signaling facilities. The project was carried out in collaboration with the municipality of Trondheim, the Norwegian Public Roads Administration and the Sør-Trøndelag county council. The System was then changed again in August 2019 with a new announcer voice and updated screens. In connection with the merger of Nord and Sør-Trøndelag into one county from 1 January 2018, the number of tariff zones in the new county was reduced from 810 to only 13, leading to significantly lower fares on some longer journeys, although the price per tariff zone went up. The AtB SISST System at the bus stop Byåsen Skole An Iveco Urbanway from Vy Buss operating on Line 80 to Solbakken Tarrifs Nord-Trøndelag was among the Norwegian counties that tried early on with a bus offer, but chose not to continue with it. Four smaller lanes had traffic starts in 1997 and five years of contract duration. These were Verran / Steinkjer / Snåsa who went to the county cars in Nord-Trøndelag (FBNT, later Trønderbilene), school route Åsen (Levanger) to Bilruta Frosta – Åsen, school route Vesdal / Inderøy to FBNT and school route Nærøy to Sturla Fjær on Ottersøy. The first tender in Sør-Trøndelag included the then city bus routes 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 13, 43 and 777 in Trondheim, most of which were among the busiest in the city, and had a traffic start on August 23, 2010. Web-owned Team Trafikk, which previously had all bus traffic in Trondheim on a concession contract, was awarded the tender in November 2009 in front of Tide Buss, Trønderbilene and Veolia Transport. In the next tender round, the rest of Team Trafikk's bus traffic in Trondheim, Klæburuten's traffic in Klæbu and Nettbuss Trøndelag's traffic in Malvik were included. Route area 1 included Klæbu including routes to Trondheim, routes 2 and 3 covered different parts of the city traffic in Trondheim, while route area 4 included traffic in Malvik including a through route to Melhus. In December 2010, lanes 1 and 2 were assigned to Trønderbilene, lane 3 was assigned to Tide Buss, while Nettbuss Trøndelag won the traffic they had previously in lane 4. The contracts for Trondheim had a traffic start on 22 August 2011, while the others had a traffic start on 1 January. 2012.In December 2011, tenders were issued for \\"scheduled public transport with a large bus in the regions of Sør-Trøndelag\\". This mainly applies to long routes and regular local routes driven by large buses (12 meters long or larger). Route area 1 covered the area south of Trondheim and east of Orkanger, route area 2 comprised the routing services from Frøya in the west to Tydal in the east, while route area 3 included the Fosen Peninsula up to Osen. In July 2012, route areas 1 and 2 were allocated to Boreal Transport Central Norway, while route area 3 was allocated to Trønderbilene.. In May 2012, the supplementary tender \\"Local public transport in the regions of Sør-Trøndelag\\" was announced, which applied to regular school routes and otherwise mini and midi bus routes. The tender was canceled in August and advertised again in October of the same year because large uncertainties were discovered regarding seat capacity and school timetable times, and therefore more time was needed for quality assurance. The offer deadline at the beginning of December was postponed for one of the route areas until the beginning of January 2013 due to further quality assurance. Route area 1 included municipalities south and east of Trondheim, route area 2 included municipalities west of Trondheim, while route area 3 included municipalities on Fosen. In February 2013, route area 1 was allocated to Nettbuss Midt-Norge, route area 2 was allocated to Boreal Transport Central Norway, while route area 3 was allocated to Trønderbilene.In January 2017, AtB announced a new tender for all route areas in Greater Trondheim, i.e. those that had traffic starts in 2010 and 2011. The tender was divided into two route areas, where Route 1 includes routes based on depots at Sandmoen, while Route 2 includes routes. linked to depot at Sorgenfri. In July 2017, the route areas were allocated to Nettbuss and Tide Buss respectively. With this tender and associated restructuring of public transport, AtB invested heavily in introducing the so-called \\"Metrobus\\" or the VanHool Exquicity 24 in Trondheim with a requirement of at least 23.5 meters in length on the metro buses, which Belgian manufacturer Van Hool is alone in offering on the Norwegian market with their VanHool Exquicity models. The start of traffic was August the 3rd 2019, and the contracts last for ten years until August 2029. After two decades without further tender rounds in public transport in Nord-Trøndelag, tenders for bus traffic in Stjørdal and Meråker were announced in December 2016. The tender had a traffic start on 1 July 2018 and is valid for only three years, until August 2021, but with the possibility of extension in up to two years. This coincides with the termination of the other contracts in the route area east of Trondheim, which gives a hint that they are expected to be announced together in the next round of tenders. In June 2017, the contract for the tender was awarded to Nettbuss, which previously had the relevant traffic on a concession contract.The other bus traffic in the former Nord- Trøndelag will be run on concession contracts expiring on 30 June 2019. Tenders for these areas was announced during 2018, where traffic started on 1 July 2019. This is due to the EU public transport regulation, which requires all public transport contracts above a certain size to be tendered and entered into force by December 3, 2019. Since 2017, Nord-Trøndelag is the only area in Norway where public transport tendering contracts are not generally introduced. Ferries and Boat Tarrifs In January 2011, AtB announced a tender for the Expressboat association Frøya - \\"Øyrekken\\" with scheduled traffic start on July 1, 2012. When only one tender had been submitted by April, AtB chose to cancel the entire tender competition.In June 2012, all traffic by scheduled boat in Sør-Trøndelag, including traffic in the canceled tender, and county-crossing routes to Nord-Trøndelag and the Kystekspressen to Kristiansund, were tendered in a total of three packages with traffic start on January 1, 2014. Package 1 included Dyrøy - Mausundvær - Sula - \\"Øyrekken\\", package 2 covered the village route in Osen, while package 3 included the county-crossing routes Trondheim - Vanvikan and Trondheim - Kristiansund. Initially, the tender was awarded in November 2012 to Boreal Transport Nord, but FosenNamsos Sjø, which had the routes on a concession contract, complained about the decision and accepted that AtB had to reject Boreal's tender, and in February 2013 FosenNamsos Sjø was finally awarded the contract.The first ferry tender under the auspices of AtB was announced in June 2013, where package 1 included the ferry link Brekstad-Valset, while package 2 included the connections Dypfest – Tarva and Garten – Storfosna / Garten – Storfosna – Leksa – Værnes. Both packages should have a traffic start on 1 January 2015 and apply until 31 December 2024. Package 1 was awarded to Norled, while package 2 was awarded to Fosenlinjen. Fosenlinjen was able to suspend the award of the contract to Norled on the basis that the margin in relation to their own offer was too small. As a result, AtB chose to cancel the tender for package 1 and instead announce it again for a shorter traffic period valid from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2018. This tender was announced in February 2015 and the contract was awarded to Boreal Transport in June of that year. Boreal had won the tender based on a solution with one large ferry, but because it wanted a two-ferry solution instead, the contract was canceled just six weeks before the start of traffic, in November 2016, and awarded to Norled instead. In February 2016, a new tender for Brekstad-Valset was announced together with Flakk-Rørvik with a contract period from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2028. In June 2016, these contracts were awarded to Fjord1 and FosenNamsos Sjø respectively. New ferries were delivered in 2019 for both connections, those are MF Austrått and MF Vestrått for the Brekstad-Valset crossing, and MF Munken and MF Lagatun for the Flakk-Rørvik Connection. Line network Atb Line Network AtB manages a total of 170 routes, 46 city routes, (some of these are only available to lease, and some only operate as School routes) of which 5 are so-called work routes (buses that often run only early in the morning and late in the evening) 17 semi-city routes (buses that start and end in the Trondheim area but doesn't Necessarily start and end in the Trondheim city area, an example can be Communities outside the main City) 87 regional routes, 17 night bus routes, (also includes trams) 18 Expressboat routes, and local traffic in Klæbu. The first bidding round was won by Team Traffic (later merged into Nettbuss Trøndelag), while Tide Buss and Trønderbilene won one and two packages respectively in the second bidding round. From 22 August 2011, all city buses in Trondheim are green. From night to 27 August 2011, AtB also took over responsibility for the night bus in Trondheim. Nettbuss Trøndelag won the last package in Trondheim and also continues to run route 301 Melhus - Trondheim - Vikhammer - Stjørdal while Trønderbilene took over the bus service in Klæbu. These routes had a tender start on 1 January 2012. The tram Gråkallbanen is also affiliated with AtB. Bus & Tram Fleet The Bus fleet in Trondheim is made up out of buses from; MAN, Heuliez, VanHool, Iveco, Volvo and Scania. In the start when AtB took over as the main transport manager, the fleet was mostly based out of the manufacturer Solaris With the Solaris Urbino 12 LE CNG and 15 CNG, a Solaris Alpino, 8,9 LE, plus a number of buses from Volvo including the Volvo 7700. All these buses got phased out by AtB after the 3rd of August 2019. AtB also had a supply of Volvo Vest center LE's that were previously used by Team Trafikk in the Trondheim Region. In June 2012 AtB added 13 MAN Lion's City GL CNG'S (or A23) and these became very popular and is now the most widely used bus in the Trondheim Area. 13 Volvo 8700's also got purchased to operate on former routes 46 and 47 to and from Klæbu. In terms of regional bus service, the Volvo 8900LE was used widely on former routes 37 and 38 (now route 70 and 71). Gråkallbanen Tram 96 at the Sidetrack in Ila These are still used as a flexible citybus option for AtB when the usual MAN Lion's City 12 metre variant is not available for service. After the 3rd of august more than 300 brand new buses were delivered to Trondheim, for use in the new transport package. 58 \\"Metrobuses\\", one of which had a fire which completely broke it apart. 13 Heuliez GX337's 23 Volvo 7900 fully electric's more than 110 MAN Lion City buses (MAN Lion's City LE L, GL CNG and GL, (or A23) and more MAN Lion's City 12 metres.) Each new bus got an extra door, self open door mechanism, sliding door mechanism, new outside announcer, new information screens, new announcer and the metrobuses also got around 50 USB ports each. AtB also began phasing out buses after 3 August with the likes of all Solaris and Volvo Vest Center buses, all volvo 7700's, all MAN Lion's City 12 metre buses with only two doors, as well as a few of the MAN Lion's City LE CNG buses with only a few remaining today. Gråkallbanen also operates 15 trams on the Tram line 9 which is the only surviving line in Trondheim after the rest got removed. Line 9 uses 14 Trams in day to day service from Siemens and partly Duwag. The Remaining 15th is a sightseeing tram used for tourist operations. The New Bus System The bus network from AtB was revamped the night from the 2nd of August to the 3rd of August, where a massive hauling operation began to move every asset to its new depot. Around 10 - 20 more routes came on the network as well as the routes being shorter than before. AtB built brand new \\"Metrobus stations\\" which is a larger bus stop With more space for the crowded parts of the city, as well as revamping smaller bus stops. The Metrobus, which is the spotlight of this operation was formerly called \\"Superbus\\" by its length and size. The Metrobus can carry around 112 passengers but not much more than a normal Articulated bus. The new System by AtB has received a mixed criticism. The system is called out for not having ticket card register machines on the Metrobus as all other buses in the network has them. It was also a big issue formerly, where there weren't enough card registering machines and ticket machines at bus stops, but AtB promised that this will be fixed and it has been. A new announcer voice was also implemented into the bus announcing systems, Where Mari Hauge Einbu is the voice actor. Many travelers have praised the voice for being very easy to understand. A Number of Bus Stops were never completed in time for the Grand Opening in 2019, but most of these will open in late 2020. One of these is located at Østmarkneset on the far end of Lade. On the 3 February, AtB did a number of changes, some of which includes; Line 10; new Terminating Stops, Line 12; New Terminating stop, on a selected number of trips, new terminal at the shopping hub City Syd and a new line which services the Gløshaugen University area, and Ilsvika to Pirbadet.

They perform at every Charlotte 49ers home football game at Jerry Richardson Stadium and also at various other events such as away football games, pep rallies, parades, and special observances. A partial band usually travels to at least one away game a year. The band includes the Colorguard and Batton Twirler. Members of the PNNMB also participate in Wind Ensemble, the Symphonic Band, and the 49ers Basketball Band. History The first marching band at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte was founded in 2015. With the restart of UNC Charlotte's football program in 2013, the university had no immediate plans to start a marching band. Alumnus and former UNC Charlotte Board of Trustees chairman Gene Johnson and his wife Vickie, also an alum, helped to organize several donations for the purchase of equipment and staff for a twenty-five-person drumline, with corresponding scholarships for the drummers. The drumline debuted with the team in 2013. The positive response to these efforts encouraged the university to develop a plan to debut a full marching band for the 2015 season. This included raising $2,000,000 for construction of a permanent home for the band and $4,500,000 to endow scholarships for band members. In fall 2014 Dr. Jeff Miller was hired as the first Director of Athletic Bands and, under UNC Charlotte Director of Bands Dr. Shawn Smith, began recruiting the inaugural band class. With an additional gift of $2,000,000 from the Johnsons ground was broken on the Vickie and Gene Johnson Marching Band Center. The members of the drumline and the pre-existing Basketball Pep Band, who would soon merge into the larger marching band, chose the name Pride of Niner Nation Marching Band for the new entity. The Pride of Niner Nation Marching Band debuted in the 2015 football season alongside the 49ers' move up to FBS level and the inaugural season of C-USA play. =Director of Athletic Bands= * 1st Director: Dr. Jeff Miller, DMA (2014–2019) * 2nd Director: Dr. Shayna Stahl, DMA (2019–current) =2018 D-Day anniversary= The Pride of Niner Nation Marching Band was invited and accepted to perform in Normandy for the 2018 D-Day anniversary observance.

A fossil ammonite, showing its horn-like spiral Ammon, eventually Amon-Ra, was a deity in the Egyptian pantheon whose popularity grew over the years, until growing into a monotheistic religion in a way similar to the proposal that the Judeo- Christian deity evolved out of the Ancient Semitic pantheon.Ancient History Encyclopedia: Yahweh Egyptian pharaohs came to follow this religion for a while, Amenhotep and Tutankhamun taking their names from their deity. This trend caught on, with other Egyptian gods also sometimes being described as aspects of Amun.The horns of Ammon The biblical narrative, however, is not as straightforward as it may seem as it also includes reference to the Canaanite god El whose name is directly referenced in \`Israel’ (He Who Struggles with God or He Who Perseveres with God). El was the chief deity of the Canaanite pantheon and the god who, according to the Bible, gave Yahweh authority over the Israelites Ammon was often depicted with ram's horns, so that as this deity became a symbol of supremacy, kings and emperors came to be depicted with Horns of Ammon on the sides of their head in profile, as well as the deities not only of Egypt, but other areas, so that Jupiter was sometimes depicted as \\"Jupiter Ammon\\", replete with Horns of Ammon, after Rome conquered Egypt, as was the Greek supreme deity Zeus. This tradition continued for centuries, Alexander the Great being referred to in the Quran as \\"The two-horned man\\", a reference to his depiction on middle-eastern coinsRecent Ancient Coin Acquisitions Focus on Alexander the Great and statuary as having horns of Ammon.Ammonite to Ammolite His deification as a conqueror had involved being declared \\"Son of Ammon\\" by the Oracle of Delphi. Pliny the Elder was among the earliest writers known to have associated spiral shells with the deity Ammon, referring to them as ammonis cornua (horns of Ammon) in his book Naturalis Historiae.NH 37.40.167 Considering the relative rarity of ammonite fossils in Egypt, this may have originated with fossil snail shells like natica hybrida found in Mokattam limestone near Cairo. The direct attribution of the Horns of Ammon with fossil cephalopod shells became common during Medieval times with mentions by writers like Georgius Agricola and Conrad Gesner. These led to a widespread association that climaxed with paleontologist Karl Alfred von Zittel naming the class of animals Ammonoidea in 1848.

The basis of the book centered around the idea that the early English-Canadian suffragists did not fail in their goal to enact a revolution amongst women, but rather were promoting the idea of a civil society consisting of British elite. A few years later, Bacchi published Women and Peace Through the Polls through the Peace Research Centre at the Australian National University. In 1990, Bacchi published Same difference: feminism and sexual difference through Allen & Unwin. At the end of the 1990s, Bacchi also published Women, policy and politics: The construction of policy problems. She was elected a Fellow of the Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia in 2000. The next year, Bacchi was appointed a Visiting Scholar at the University of Ottawa Research Centre for Women and Politics. In 2003, Bacchi wrote Fear of Food: A Diary of Mothering, which chronicled her struggle with her first sons birth and early childhood. In 2009, she published Analysing Policy: What's the Problem Represented to Be? through Pearson Australia Pty Ltd and retired as an Emerita Professor. In 2010, Bacchi co-edited a book with Joan Eveline titled Mainstreaming Politics: Gendering Practices and Feminist Theory through the University of Adelaide Press. That same year, she was a Visiting Professor at two Denmark university's; University of Aalborg and Roskilde University. While there, she presented her paper titled Foucault, Policy and Rule: Challenging the Problem- Solving Paradigm to the Feminist Research Center in Aalborg. In 2012 Engaging with Carol Bacchi: Strategic Interventions and Exchanges, an edited collection exploring her work, to which she also contributed, was published by the University of Adelaide Press. In 2014, Bacchi was granted a Visiting Professor status at Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona. Two years later, she published Poststructural Policy Analysis: A Guide to Practice with Susan Goodwin where they addressed \\"What's the Problem Represented to Be?\\" (WRP). They used a post-structural perspective and the works of Foucault to analyze public policy. In 2017, Bacchi was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from Umeå University in Sweden.

Weisstein's main area of work was based in social psychology and cognitive neuroscience. She considered herself a radical feminist and used comedy and rock music as a way to disseminate her views and ideologies: Weisstein was an active member in founding the Chicago Women's Liberation Union, which promoted feminist activities and improved women's way of life. She received a Bachelor of Arts from Wellesley College in 1961. She then went on to complete her PhD at Harvard University in 1964. After her PhD, she finished her post-doctoral fellowship at the University of Chicago. Furthermore, she was a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the American Psychological Society.  Biography  Weisstein was born on October 16, 1939 to parents Mary Menk and Samuel Weisstein. Growing up, Weisstein was inspired to pursue a career in science after reading the book Microbe Hunters written by Paul de Kruif. After completing many years of schooling and educational work, she became bedridden in 1983 due to chronic fatigue syndrome and after battling ovarian cancer, she died on March 26, 2015. = School and work life = Weisstein graduated from Wellesley College in 1961 and during her time there, she was a member of Phi Beta Kappa, composed music, did stand-up comedy and wrote for the school newspaper. She later received a PhD from Harvard University in 1964. Meanwhile, Weisstein had to complete her laboratory work at Yale University where she met her husband, Jesse Lemisch, and close friend, Virginia Blaisdell. After receiving her PhD, Weisstein completed a post- doctoral fellowship at the University of Chicago with the Committee of Mathematical Biology. She later taught at the University of Chicago, Loyola University and the State University of New York until 1983. Weisstein was also a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the American Psychological Society.  Education  Naomi Weisstein completed her academic degree at four different universities. All of these universities were attended for different reasons, and several accomplishments were completed at each. = Harvard University = During her time at Harvard, Weisstein specialized in visual neuroscience. She also did research in the areas of visual cognition and cognitive neuroscience. Her dissertation was on the concept of parallel processing; which is the notion that the brain is an active agent in shaping reality. This concept is still being investigated today and modern researchers are building off of the work that Weisstein produced. Weisstein graduated at the top of her class and completed her PhD in three years, despite gender discrimination from the male students and faculty. On her first day, Weisstein, along with the other female students, were told that they did not belong in graduate school, as they should be more focused on becoming wives and mothers. She was also unable to use the equipment that Harvard had to offer because they questioned her ability to use it properly, and the faculty prioritized the male students' access to the equipment. She was then denied entry to the Lamont Library on campus due to the idea that women would distract the male students studying inside. All of these incidents prompted her to complete her PhD at Yale University where she was given the proper tools and access to complete her research. = University of Chicago and Loyola University = After completing her PhD at Harvard University, Weisstein went to the University of Chicago to complete a post-doctoral fellowship with the Committee on Mathematical Biology. She pursued this opportunity because she wanted to enhance her mathematical knowledge. Since she wanted to continue her research in neuroscience, Weisstein believed that she had to complete this fellowship in order to be taken seriously in the field. During her time at the University of Chicago, Weisstein joined several political groups including the Student-Non-Violent Coordinating Committee in 1964, the Women's Radical Action Project as a consciousness-raising for feminist in 1965 and the University of Chicago Students for a Democratic Society in 1965. While working at the university, Weisstein still faced many challenges including not being able to become a full professor because of the Nepotism Rule. Even further, faculty members began pressuring Weisstein to focus on having a family instead of pursuing her research. She was then fired from the University of Chicago in 1966. These incidents, along with her previous history at Harvard University, prompted her to become a feminist political activist. Some of her acts included publishing articles within the field of psychology that detailed the lack of understanding of females, as well as joining the Congress on Radical Equality. In 1969, she had a role in founding the Chicago Women’s Liberation Union with notable feminist community organizers such as Heather Booth and Vivian Rothstein; which included a rock band (Chicago Women’s Liberation Rock Band) with two notable songs written by Weisstein. This union prioritized improving the lives of all women and other marginalized communities, such as the LGBT community. Weisstein began working at Loyola University in 1966 after being fired from the University of Chicago. It was at this institution that Weisstein completed the process of receiving tenure. She also began publishing articles on neuropsychology. She continued to join political groups such as the Chicago Westside Group in 1967 and the New University Conference in 1969. She remained at Loyola University until 1973, but ultimately had to leave due to the institution's inability to provide her with the equipment and support necessary to continue her cognitive neuroscience research. = State University of New York = In the mid-1970s, Weisstein and her husband Lemisch moved to Buffalo, New York, to work at the State University of New York. She continued to pursue her research in the field of cognitive neuroscience and mentored many graduate students throughout her years there. She was awarded the Guggenheim Fellowship grant in 1979. This grant is awarded to those who have displayed outstanding creativity and productive scholarships. Weisstein also wrote an article for the New Haven Women's Liberation monthly magazine, \\"Will The Women's Movement Survive?\\" Weisstein faced harassment from other faculty at the institution. This included intimidating her students, disputing her findings and sexual harassment. These incidents caused Weisstein to take a leave of absence from the university and she was later diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome. According to Weisstein and her husband, this was due to the constant attacks from the faculty members, however, there was no formal conclusion made. She became bedridden in 1983 due to her condition.  Work as a psychologist  Figure 1: Psychological figureWeisstein took an active role in studying the sexism within the field of psychology. In August 1970, along with Phyllis Chesler, Joanne Evans Gardner, and others, Weisstein founded American Women in Psychology, now Division 35 of the American Psychological Association. She focused on social psychology and how social expectations influence and confound research. She was an important figure in contributing to the feminist movement by identifying distortions and biases in psychology. = Psychological constructs of women = Weisstein believed that psychology was prejudiced towards women, in that psychologists did not respect evidence that showed men and women were equal. Weisstein stated that due to the prejudice, psychologists limit the discovery of actual human potential that women possess. Similarly, according to Weisstein, women were only looked at in terms of the social expectations of them (i.e. weaker, 'nurturer', inferior, etc.). She details more of her ideas in her article, Psychology Constructs the Female.  Work as a neuroscientist  Figure 2: Example of figure-ground organization image, where identification of black figure is determined through the white background. Her research in the field of cognitive neuroscience focused on how the brain forms perceptions. Her work showed that the brain does not passively receive information, but instead that the human mind actively assigns meaning to what it sees. This is known as the concept of parallel processing. Weisstein focused on three main areas of research: visual detection, flickering and non-flickering regions perception, and figure-ground organization and spatial frequency. All of her studies were in collaboration with other notable researchers in the field. = Visual detection = In 1974, Judith Rich Harris and Naomi Weisstein discovered that when a target line is presented to an individual, it is better identified when combined in an appearing three-dimensional object (i.e. overlapping squares), in comparison to a simple two-dimensional line. = Flickering and non-flickering regions perception = Later in 1985, Eva Wong and Weisstein indicated that the depth segregation (the perception of flickering regions lies behind the non- flickering regions in visual field) is caused by a visual channel response to higher temporal frequency. = Figure-ground organization and spatial frequency = In 1986, Victor Klymenko and Naomi Weisstein found that spatial frequency differences have the ability to alter ambiguous patterns of images that are perceived through their background (i.e., figure-ground organization depicted in Figure 2). They discovered that if there is higher spatial frequency, then it is more likelihood that a figure will be seen in the stimuli. Moreover, this can be influenced and affected by several factors (i.e., shape and occlusion cues).  Notable publications  * Weisstein, N. (1971). Psychology constructs the female (pp. 68–83).

She was the \\"first North American single-woman missionary to China\\", and one of the band of women that laid broad and deep foundations in the early days of missionary work in the Chinese empire. Affiliated with the Protestant Episcopal Church, Fay entered the missionary field from Albany, New York, sailing for China, November 8, 1850, the first single woman sent there by the missionary society. She established in her own house in Shanghai a boarding school for boys, and from this she educated teachers and preachers to carry on the work. Known as \\"Lady Fay\\" to her pupils, her efforts developed from this very small beginning into the Doane Hall and Theological School. For nineteen months, Fay worked on revising the Syllabic Dictionary manuscript. She contributed to magazines and papers, and had exceptional translation skills from Chinese language into English. Early life and education Lydia Mary Fay was born in Bennington, Vermont, 1804. She spent her early life near Albany, New York. Her studies included reading European literature. Career =Teacher= Originally a Presbyterian, Fay became an Episcopalian in 1840. She began her career as a governess near Alexandria, Virginia. In 1847, she removed to Warrensburg, New York before moving to Miller's Tavern, Virginia to serve as principal at the Midway Female Academy. =Missionary= At the age of 46, she began her missionary work, appointed as a missionary teacher under Bishop William Jones Boone, of the Protestant Episcopal Church Mission (PECM). She sailed for China, in the ship Horatio, November 8, 1850 — the first single woman sent from America to China by a missionary society. Writing to a friend soon after her arrival in early 1851, Fay said:— \\"It is a difficult thing to keep the heart at the spiritual heights it has gained, and perhaps the first rude shock to the young missionary's faith, on his arrival in heathen lands, is the utter indifference of the people, the clouds of incense that dim his sight, and the harsh music that deafens his ears, as he finds himself in some lofty temple, near huge idols, before whom crowds are prostrating themselves and offering all the worship their darkened, untaught hearts are capable of, and I exclaim, 'Who is sufficient for these things, and how can the still, small voice of the Spirit ever touch the hearts of these noisy idolaters, or how can the missionary be seen through the clouds of incense, or the voice be heard in the din of gongs and drums?'\\" The PECM was in poor condition during the American Civil War (1861-65). The funds were low, and the work languished. In 1860, Fay moved with her students to the Church Missionary Society, in which she had been obliged for a while to work in consequence of a lack of means to sustain the school. In 1867, she returned to the PECM school.Episcopal Church. Domestic and Foreign Missionary Society., Episcopal Church. Board of Missions. (1872). The Spirit of missions. Burlington, N.J.: J. L. Powell. Meanwhile, she had become acquainted with a small school of orphan boys, under the charge of Dr. Henderson, an English physician, who was known by missionaries and people throughout the city. These orphan boys he had found, poor and destitute and homeless, wandering about the streets. He fed, clothed and taught them. When he died, his widow, on her return to England, turned them over to the care of Fay. Lydia Mary Fay and her students She established in her own house in Shanghai a boarding school for boys, which she called her \\"gravest responsibility,\\" as through this agency she hoped to raise up teachers and preachers who would carry on future work. She not only taught in the school, carried all the domestic cares, provided for the clothing, kept all the finances, but devoted much time to the study and translation of the Chinese language. In addition, she had the oversight of boys' day schools, and conducted a class of student teachers. A few years later, a donation from some women in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, together with a little money contributed in Shanghai, enabled Fay to receive a few more boys, so that the school numbered twenty pupils. In addition, she traveled to Kong Wan with Mr. Nelson on Sundays and Thursdays, where she has charge of a girls' school, and attended the sick in the hospital. She lived frugally, without many of the comforts which are generally thought necessary in an inhospitable climate. At the close of her 25th year in China, the school which she had established was turned over to the Episcopal Board. It had developed into Doane Hall and Theological School, with president, professors, and with ten Chinese teachers. Some of her pupils and joined the Christian ministry. This anniversary was held in her own house, and was largely attended. A translation of an address was read, from a large number of Chinese, congratulating \\"Lady Fay\\" on the memorable occasion. =Writer= Fay aided Dr. Samuel Wells Williams in the revision of the manuscript of his Syllabic Dictionary. She was engaged in this work for nineteen months, and with the aid of a Chinese assistant, revised every one of the 60,000 phrases. She was also a contributor to magazines and papers, and published a good translation of the various official documents connected with the emperor's marriage in 1872. She was said to have \\"exceptional skills in translating Chinese written texts\\". Later life In the 28 years of her missionary career, Fay visited the United States but once. Her later life included several age-related illnesses so that, from the mid-1860s, she took extended breaks from her work, either resting in her room or at Chinese sanatorium towns. Her health continued to fail, and a trip to Chefoo (now known as Yantai) was recommended, but it did not improve her health. She had a great desire to return to her home in Shanghai, but this was denied her, and on October 5, 1878, surrounded by missionaries and friends, she died. The funeral was attended by a large number of visitors and residents, and the flag of the United States Consulate was put at half-mast in token of respect to Fay. She was buried in the foreigners cemetery of Chefoo.

At that time, the land had been depressed under the weight of the Laurentide Ice Sheet, which was up to thick. Areas on the Anticosti Island and low-lying regions of Quebec and the Maritimes bordering the Saint Lawrence were below sea level. As the land rebounded over the next 3,000 years, despite rising sea levels the sea retreated to roughly the present boundaries of the Gulf. Name The term \\"Goldthwait Sea\\" was proposed by Elson in 1969 to distinguish the area from the Champlain Sea and the Laflamme Sea. The sea is named after the geologist James Walter Goldthwait (1880–1947). He did impressive work for the Geological Survey of Canada in the east of the country, and in Quebec in particular, despite handicaps such as lack of aerial photographs or detailed topographical maps. The quality of his observations and his insights were remarkable. Overall process Formation of the Goldthwait Sea was part of a broader process in what is now eastern Canada towards the end of the Last Glacial Period. The atmosphere was warmer near the oceans and towards the south, so melting of the Laurentide Ice Sheet progressed from east to west and from south to north. Around 12,000 years ago the Saint Lawrence Valley was opened to sea waters, The western arm of the Goldthwait Sea quickly extended up the Saint Lawrence, and this was followed by the Champlain Sea invasion. Three factors affected the area of the sea: the retreat of the ice sheet, isostatic rebound by the land and the rising sea level. The final retreat of the Laurentide Ice Sheet from eastern North America occurred between 12,000 and 10,000 years age. Freed from the pressure of the ice sheet, the land began to rise, and the shores of the seas retreated. This post-glacial rebound (or isostatic rebound) continues today. Isostatic rebound was rapid at first, and 85% of the coastal area had emerged by 9,000 years ago. 13,000 years ago the rate of rebound was per year. Today it continues, but has slowed to per year. Large amounts of fresh water, including melted ice and precipitation, flowed into the North Atlantic Ocean during the deglaciation. Water was released from the glacial Lake St Lawrence around 11,000 years ago, and from the glacial Lake Agassiz between 10,900 and 9,900 years ago. Renewed warming caused run-off from the glacial Lake Agassiz and Lake Barlow-Ojibway between 9,500 and 8,000 years ago. The water seems to have flowed out into the ocean without mixing with the salt water in the depths of the Goldthwait Sea. Chronology The Goldthwait Sea, defined as the late-Glacial and post-Glacial invasion of the sea into Saint Lawrence estuary east of Quebec City and the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, began around 14,000 years ago. This was when the ice sheet was first withdrawn from the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. At that time the global sea level was about lower than it is today. The sea was able to cover the coastal areas of the Saint Lawrence because the land had subsisided under the burden of the ice sheet. After this, sea levels gradually rose as water from the ice sheet was returned to the ocean, but at the same time the land rebounded, causing a complex sequence of submersion. There were two main phases, a short phase of sea invasion as soon as the ice sheet moved back from the coast, and a much longer phase of retreat as the continent rose isostatically, a process that is not yet fully complete. Dionne (1977) proposes three major episodes: Lower Goldthwaitian 13,500 to 12,000 years ago, Middle Goldthwaitian 12,000 to 9,000 years ago, and Upper Goldthwaitian, 9,000 years ago until the present. Complicating the picture is that deglaciation did not occur at the same time throughout the region, so the sea reached the south and east of the area before it reached the west and north. To allow for regional variations in the timing of events, Dionne therefore proposes calling the phases Goldthwaitian I, II and III. In the first phase, lasting 500 to 1,500 years, the sea followed the retreating glacier front. The waters were cold and salinity low, and the sea was often ice-covered. The sea may have been prevented from entering some of the valleys by lingering ice. Isostatic recovery began in this phase. In the second phase, lasting for 2,000 to 3,000 years, the sea first advanced and then retreated. During this phase isostatic uplift was rapid, but sea levels were also rising. There was much sedimentation along the shoreline, with deltas formed at the mouths of the main rivers on the north shore fed by meltwater from the ice sheet on the Laurentian Shield. The waters were still cold, but warmer and more saline than before. The third phase, lasting from 9,000 or 8,000 years ago until the present, was one of the sea slowly retreating. Isostatic recovery slowed to a few millimeters per year, but sea level rises were also small. Around 5,500 years ago the last of the ice sheet vanished from the center of Quebec. During this phase streams cut channels through the sediments laid down in the previous phase. Changes in extent  The Goldthwait Sea began to form in the Saint Lawrence Estuary and Gulf around 13,500 years ago. By 9,300 years age the ice front had retreated about from the present shoreline in the north coast region between Rivière-Pentecôte and Sept-Îles, as shown by a belt of end moraines. The present coastal plain was covered by the Goldthwait Sea. Over the next 400 years the ice completely withdrew from the area, and the sea grew to its maximum size, with a coast parallel to the present coast but about inland. Some fjords reached further inland. The sea covered about of what is now Quebec, including Anticosti Island, the south of the Saint Lawrence between Lévis and Baie-Saint-Paul, and the north shore between Les Escoumins and Blanc-Sablon. Many shorelines can be seen at different elevations in the area that was once submerged. The limit of land once covered by the Goldthwait Sea varies from above the present sea level at Godbout, Quebec to at Sept-Îles further to the northeast. The difference can be partly accounted for by the ice cap having retreated earlier in the southern area, which would have rebounded further before the sea levels rose. There must have also been a thicker ice sheet further north, depressing the land further. Sedimentary evidence The bed of the Goldthwait sea had inter-layered coarse sands and silty clays around its margins, and massive light gray fine clays further down. Rebound has exposed these sediments along the Saint Lawrence river and estuary. The bed of the Upper Saint Lawrence Estuary has glacial tills and bedrock covered by upwards of of bluish-gray marine clays dating to the Goldthwait age. Three type of sediment can be seen along the Quebec coast. Silt and clay were deposited in deep water where river currents had no influence, deltaic sands were deposited where currents carried sediment into the sea, and as the sea receded a blanket of coastal sand was deposited over both these types of sediment. Tidal flat clays are also found in some backwater areas of the sea.

She develops new materials for energy conversion in harsh environments. These include solid oxide fuel cells and corrosion-resistant materials for nuclear energy regeneration.  Early life and education  Yildiz was born to two teachers in İzmir, who made her appreciate education and hard work. She became interested in science and engineering whilst at primary school and chose to attend the science specialist school in her home town. During school Yildiz worked with a local university on a project to clean the waters in İzmir bay. Yildiz was an exchange student with a farming school in Wisconsin and had the opportunity to visit Fermilab. She spent her summer holidays on the Aegean Sea. Eventually Yildiz studied nuclear engineering at the Hacettepe University, where she particularly became interested in the technology of nuclear engineering. At the time there were not clear career paths for her to pursue this in Turkey, and Yildiz decided to move to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Yildiz earned her PhD at MIT in 2003 and remained there as a postdoctoral research associate.  Research and career  Whilst working as a research scientist at Argonne National Laboratory Yildiz became interested in electrochemistry and surface science. She returned to MIT as the Norman C. Rasmussen Assistant Professor in 2007. Yildiz leads the Laboratory for Electrochemical Interfaces at MIT. Her research considers how surfaces respond to harsh conditions, including high temperatures, reactive gases, mechanical stress and applied fields. She studies what happens to the electrodes in fuel cells and electrolyzers. By studying the reaction and transport kinetics in fuel cells or cells designed for water splitting, Bilgie hopes to suppress the corrosion of these materials. She has developed in situ scanning tunneling microscopy methods to study the atoms at the surface of the electrodes, which often behave differently to those in the bulk. Scanning tunneling microscopes (STMs) can map atomic tomography as well as electronic structure, providing information about the surface morphology and chemical reactivity. The Yildiz modified STM can also create precise dislocations in a material using the STM tip. Alongside electrochemistry, the Yildiz group develop artificial intelligence and probabilistic methods to try and predict failures in nuclear reactors. In nuclear reactions, metal structures that are critical to safety can degrade due to hydrogen penetration. Hydrogen infiltration can make metals mechanically weak. Yildiz has studied the interaction of hydrogen with the oxides that form on the surfaces of metals. She identified that lattice vacancies can act to trap hydrogen. By identifying the mechanism by which hydrogen enters oxide films, she has designed new alloy compositions that can prevent it. Another challenge for the materials that are used inside power plants is that they can suffer from stress corrosion. Most of these materials are polycrystalline, and the grain boundaries between adjacent tiny crystals can impact a material's response to stress. Yildiz has investigated how grain boundaries and dislocations influence the mechanical and chemical properties of materials. She has demonstrated that dislocations in an atomic lattice can speed up the transport of oxygen ions, increasing the rate of diffusion in fuel cells and oxygen separation membranes. Her recent work has considered the mechanisms responsible for oxygen reduction kinetics in perovskite oxides, as well as investigating interface chemistries in high power density solid batteries. Yildiz identified that strontium cobaltite can switch between a metallic and semiconducting state using a small voltage, which means that it could be used in non-volatile memory. Yildiz has identified the effects of elastic strain, oxygen pressure and dislocations on the degradation and reactivity of hybrid materials. Her group are contributing to the Mars 2020 Mars OXygen In situ resource utilization Experiment (MOXIE) instrument, which will attempt to make oxygen out of Martian resources. In 2014 Yildiz was awarded tenure at MIT. = Awards and honours = Her awards and honours include; * 2006 Argonne National Laboratory Pace Setter Award * 2011 MISTI Global Seed Fund * 2012 National Science Foundation CAREER Award * 2012 International Union of Materials Research Societies Somiya Award * 2012 Charles W.

The Late Neoclassical, two-storey main building is from 1852 but was widened in 1901. Anders Lassen, the only non- Commonwealth recipient of the British Victoria Cross in the Second World War, was born on the estate in 1920. History =17th and 18th century= Hans Gustav Lillienskiold The origins and early history is unclear but the estate is first mentioned as Høvdingshus in records from the beginning of the 17th century and again in Christian V's Matrikel. It was then a rather small manor owned by the Crown. Om 1719, it was included in Vordingborg Cavalry District. Høvdingsgaard was the largest of the 77 farms in the Parish of Mern. Niels Lunde Reiersen In 1774, Vordingborg Cavalry District was divided into 12 estates and sold in public auction. Two of the estates, No. 10 and No. 11, were bought by Hans Gustav Lillienskiold. One of them kept the name Høvdingshus and the other one was given the name Lilliendal. Much of the land was leased by Peder Neergaard from Billeborg at Herfølge. In 1785, Lillienskiold sold both estates to the wealthy merchant Niels Lunde Reiersen from Copenhagen. He was already the owner of Nysø, Jungshoved and Oremandsgaard. The two new estates consolidated his status as one of the largest landowners on Southern Zealand. He died unmarried in 1795. =19th century= Ernst Frederik August Bilsted for whom the new main building was constructed in 1852 In 1795, Høvdingsgaard and Lilliendal were sold to Attorney General Peter Uldall. He had earlier in his career been the defense attorney of Queen Caroline Mathilde and Johann Friedrich Struensee. Peter Uldall passed away just two years after buying the estates. He had prior to his death changed the name of the Høvdingshus estate to Høvdingsgård. His widow, Anthonette Hansen, sold Høvdingsgård and Lilliendal buyers around a year later. The new main building The new owner of Høvdingsgård was Lars Terpager Hagen. He had previously leased Petersgaard from his father-in-law Peter Johansen. Lars Terpager Hagen's son, Peter Hagen, inherited the estate after hisfather's death in 1833. He was hit by mental decease and died in 1848. Høvdingsgård was then passed to his sister, Maren Regine Hagen, and her husband, Ernst Frederik Andreas Bilsted. In 1852, Bilsted constructed a new main building with the assistance of the architect Vilhelm Theodor Walther. Ernst Frederik Andreas Bilsted died in 1871. In 1883, Maren Regine Hagen ceded the estate to their two sons-in-law, Fritz Peter Adolph Uldall and Bredo Ove Ernst von Obelitz, who both lived in Copenhagen. Fritz Peter Adolph Uldall. who was the great-grandson of Peter Ildall, was a vice admiral in the Royal Danish Navy. Bredo Ove Ernst von Obelitz was a Supreme Court justice. =20th century= In 1901, Høvdingsgård was acquired by A. F. J. C. Lassen. He had previously been the owner of a tobacco plantation on Sumatra. In 1917, it was sold to his son Emil Victor Schou Lassen. He was married to Suzanne Marie Raben-Levetzau. Their son Anders Lassen, was born on the estate in 1920. He would later be only non-Commonwealth recipient of the British Victoria Cross in the Second World War. In 1938, Høvdingsgaard was acquired by the merchant Hans Lystrup. His daughter, Karen Marie Hansdatter Lystrup, who was married to Anders Dinesen, inherited the estate after her father's death in 1963. Today Høvdingsgtård is currently owned by Anita Halbye (née Dinesen). The estate has a total area of 792 hectares. Cultural references Høvdingsgård was used as a location for the eponymous, fictional manor house in the 1953 feature film Hejrenæs (1953).

It operated between 1873 and about 1895.  Description  The main quarry site was an open pit high near the summit of Mynydd Cambergi, about above the floor of the valley. There were 7 levels of terraces running into the pit, and significant waste tips below the terraces. A long and steep 4-pitch incline ran down to the road at the bottom of the valley. There were several small mills on the terraces. At the foot of the incline, on the south side of the road, was a slate-built mill, containing nine saw tables and a slate planer. The mill was unusual in its use of shafts that ran beneath the working floor of the mill. This was due to the mill's placement above the level of the river that drove the waterwheel. The quarry dammed the Afon Llefenni upstream of the quarry, near Hengae House to power the waterwheel. In October 1896, the dam burst and flooded many homes in Aberllefenni, though it was later rebuilt to serve the main Aberllefenni quarry. The quarry worked the Broad Vein that was also quarried at Abercwmeiddaw and Maes-y-Gamfa.  History  The Cambergi Slate Company Limited was formed in 1873 to work the quarry, with a 10,000 £20 shares offered to the public. It took them company two years to construct the mill, the incline and start the quarry. They proposed that a branch of the Corris Railway was built along Cwm Hengae to the Cambergi mill, but construction of this did not begin. Instead the output of the mill was carted to the Corris Railway, either to the tramway at the Aberllefenni quarry, or all the way to Aberllefenni station. The substantial construction costs bankrupted the original company, who only operated the quarry for a few months in 1895. The lease was taken over by the Griffiths family. Griffith Williams Griffiths who had been working a small quarry at the top of Cwm Hengae for nearly a decade, took over Cambergi. However, the slate was poor quality, and in 1877 he began work on Hengae quarry on the opposite side of the valley. In 1879, Cambergi was one of several local quarries to shut down in response a fall in the price of slate. By 1880 the quarry had re-opened. Griffiths continued to work Cambergi, but by 1883 he was trying to sell up. He did not find a buyer and instead took a loan from The North and South Wales Bank to continue working. In 1887, the bank was pressuring him to repay his debts. In 1889, the quarry lent its mill to house the local Eistedfodd, but Griffiths continued to struggle financially. He tried to sell the quarry again in 1896, but again the potential buyer declined. Instead he renewed the lease and continued working. After one more attempt to sell Cambergi in 1897, Griffiths finally gave up just before the turn of the century. The quarry is shown as disused on the 1900 Ordnance Survey map. The quarry remained in the Griffiths family, and in 1920 Griffith William's grandson attempted once more the sell Cambergi, this time along with Hengae and over 1000 acres of land in the valley. As before, he could not find a buyer.

He was noted for his use of typography, his color sense, his visual wit, and for bringing a British sensibility to the California aesthetic. American designer Paula Scher noted Piercy’s “keen vision, especially about L.A. I think it may have taken a British ex-pat to have such clear eyes about the left coast. He taught me to see Los Angeles.” Piercy won multiple design awards, and was named a Fellow of the American Institute of Graphic Arts [AIGA] in 2009.  Early life and education  Piercy was born in Cheltenham, England, United Kingdom, to Kitty (nee Burke) and Ray Piercy. He was the youngest of three children. As a teenager, Piercy developed two preoccupations: graphic design, and America. Piercy said later that realized he wanted to be designer by age 11, when he first saw the Peter Blake’s “wonderful” cover of the Beatles' album Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, “which was full of American imagery.” Similarly, he was impressed and inspired by the New Oxford Shakespeare series of book covers by Milton Glaser, who he described as the “greatest living American graphic designer.” At the same time, he developed a fascination with American life and culture, and especially with southern California: “California was so glamorous...I was particularly enamored with Los Angeles, just looking at Billy Wilder films and Max Yavno photos, all that.” Piercy studied graphic design and illustration at Brighton School of Art and Technology (now the University of Brighton School of Art), and graduated with honors.  Professional Life  From 1978-79, Piercy worked at Harpers & Queen in London as an editorial designer. There he met and partnered with designer Michael Hogdson, with whom he continued a professional collaboration for several decades. In 1979, Piercy took a position in the in-house design department at the BBC in London, working primarily on television graphics. He described his experience there as formative, teaching him standards that influenced him throughout his career: “The greatest lesson I learned there, and one that I carry with me always, is that they showed me how vital it is to use all of your outside influences and interests in your work, that ideas count for much more than showy layouts, and that an atmosphere of friendship and good humor must inhabit any worthwhile creative studio environment.” In 1982, Piercy emigrated to the United States with his wife, illustrator Ann Field. They settled in Santa Monica, California. “It was so exciting to be here in the eighties,” he said. “There was so much sky in Los Angeles, compared to where I had come from,” said Piercy. “You can’t help but be influenced by it.” As a designer at the Rod Dyer Design Group, Piercy created several well-known works and projects, including movie posters and album covers. He also helped re-design Santa Monica’s Shangri-La Hotel (“a dream job”), and designed the daily newspaper supplement on the 1984 Olympics for the Los Angeles Times. With partner Michael Hodgson, Piercy founded Ph.D, a design and communications firm in Santa Monica. Clients included Nike, Herman Miller, Chronicle Books, and Quiksilver. It was at Ph.D that Piercy developed his mature style, which was characterized by its typography, “unique and delicious” use of color, art direction of fashion photography, and sense of humor; Ph.D’s work was praised for its “visual acuity, crisp thinking and penetrating wit.” In 2007, Piercy established air conditioned, a graphic design firm in Santa Monica focusing predominantly on clients from creative industries. Los Angeles writer Jack Skelley observed that Piercy’s work in this period, no matter the context, exhibited wit and a sense of play: “Whether in advertising or art, Clive fused word and image with an arch slyness. Even the most straightforward layout held a layer of satire, or at least playfulness.”  Notable works  Piercy created and art-directed hundreds of projects for a wide range of clients, including posters, album covers, logos, book designs, signage, exterior graphics, exhibition designs, interior design concepts, and package designs. Among Piercy’s better-known works: * Album cover design, Elton John, Too Low for Zero (1983) * Brand design, Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts (Los Angeles) * Album cover design, Julian Lennon, Help Yourself (1991) (collaboration with Ann Field) * Book design for Unplugged kitchen: A Return to the Simple, Authentic Joys of Cooking, by Viana LaPlace (1996) (collaboration with Ann Field) * Book design for Curb Your Enthusiasm: The Book, by Larry David (2006) (collaboration with Ann Field) * Book design for Living in a Modern Way: California Design, 1930-1965, edited by Wendy Kaplan (2011) * Book design for An Eames Primer, by Eames Demetrios (2013) * Opening titles for Married in America, a television documentary directed by Michael Apted. (2003) In addition, Piercy collaborated with John Sabel on the David Fincher movie Se7en (1995). Piercy and Sabel designed and produced serial killer John Doe’s highly visual diaries, which figured prominently in the film and film titles.  Awards, honors, and exhibitions  In 2009, Piercy was named a Fellow of the American Institute of Graphic Arts [AIGA], recognizing designers who have made a significant contribution to raising the standards of excellence in practice. Piercy received multiple recognitions for his design work, both solo and in collaboration with others: * Nomination, Grammy Award for Best Recording Package, Late Night Sessions (1999) * Group show, Bleak: American Beauty, Chandler Fine Art, San Francisco (2004) * Nomination, James Beard Award for Restaurant Design (2012) * Exhibition, 100 Years of Graphic Design, Kemistry Gallery, London (2015)  Writing In 2003, Piercy published Pretty Vacant: The Los Angeles Dingbat Observed (Chronicle Books, 2003), a book of largely black-and-white photographs showcasing the dingbat, a type of vernacular apartment building that was popular in Los Angeles in the 1950s and 1960s, and which was first brought to scholarly attention in Reyner Banham’s book Los Angeles: the Architecture of Four Ecologies. Piercy’s book was praised by critics both for its content (his approach was likened to the serial documentary photographs of Ed Ruscha) and its design.  Teaching  Piercy was a professor at Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California, serving on the faculty of the Graphic Design and Illustration departments. “Teaching is a very big part of what I do,” he said. “It has fueled my creative soul in a big way.” In the 90's, he also taught graphic design at Otis College of Art & Design. Piercy himself repeated this advice to students, urging them above all to manifest themselves in their work: \\"There are plenty of designers in the world; we are doing perfectly well without you. But what there is a true lack of is great graphic designers. So that is your obligation if you are in this class, to be great. And the greatest thing you can do as a designer is have work that is representative of your character, that reflects who you are, that is a manifestation of your taste.\\"  Personal life  Piercy was married to British-American illustrator Ann Field, with whom he collaborated frequently. He died in Santa Monica in 2017, of cancer.

As a solo musician performing under the existing band name, Spivey released her full-length debut recording A Conversation Between Us on February 1, 2019, produced by Eli Strobeck. The album, an LP with more pop influence than her indie-styled debut EP, spun the singles \\"Oceans\\", \\"Quiet Sounds\\", and “Nicotine & Tangerines”. The band has toured extensively, opening for a variety of acts including Can't Swim, Broadside, With Confidence, Chaos Chaos, The Regrettes, and Shortly, as well as headlining their own dates and performing at festivals such as Bled Fest in Howell, Michigan, and The Fest in Gainesville, Florida.  Move to releasing music as Cayley Spivey  On August 5, 2020, Spivey announced that she would be releasing music for the first time under her given name rather than under the Small Talks moniker. At midnight Eastern Time on August 14, 2020, Spivey released her first single under her own name, entitled \\"SFU,\\" meaning \\"so fucked up.\\" According to Spivey, the single \\"is an anthem for being trapped in a less than ideal situation through the lens of a hopeless romantic. I have a habit of romanticizing things that aren’t good for me whenever I’m not ready to let it go. This is me sharing my story of being stuck in a loop until I could see clearly enough to remove love’s blinders and walk away. Love can make me do crazy things, this song was my way of reflecting on why that is.\\"  Personal life  Spivey identifies as pansexual, and refers to her sexuality – as well as her gender – as an integral piece of her sound, stating \\"a lot of my songs are inspired by relationships that I've had, and that comes from me being LGBTQ.\\" She has embraced viral social media video app TikTok both as a music artist and as an LGBTQ performer, garnering 164,000 followers in her first year on the platform.

It has been the home of Blackheath Quaker MeetingBlackheath Quaker Meeting website since 1972, and is also used by many community groups. Designed by Trevor Dannatt, it is believed to be the only Quaker Meeting House in Britain built in the Brutalist style. In the survey of Quaker meeting houses Quaker Meeting Houses Heritage Report conducted by the Architectural History PracticeArchitectural History Practice website for Historic England and Quakers in Britain it was described as a \\"Brutalist jewel\\" and \\"of exceptional aesthetic value\\". History Quakers met at various places in south-east London from the late seventeenth century onwards, including Greenwich, Deptford and Woolwich.White, Winifred M., Six Weeks Meeting, 1671–1971: three hundred years of Quaker responsibility, London: Society of Friends. Six Weeks Meeting, 1971 When the existing Meeting at Woolwich outgrew its meeting house in the 1960s, the Meeting moved to Blackheath, where most of its members lived, and the meeting house was sold in 1964. Initially the Meeting met in church buildings, latterly that of the Congregational Church in Independents Road, Blackheath. Six Weeks Meeting (now London Quakers Property Trust), the managing trustee of London's Quaker meeting houses, purchased land in central Blackheath with a view to building a new meeting house, but the project did not proceed. The Congregationalists leased Quakers a small (0.044 ha) building plot at the end of Independents Road, next to their church hall. The brief for the new building—\\"a modern building to fit in with the forward-looking community around it\\"Appeal flyer (1968), quoted in Butler 1999—was issued in 1967. The meeting house was to contain some facilities intended for joint use with the Congregationalists. Shortly after the meeting house was completed, the Congregational church became redundant when the Congregational and Presbyterian churches merged at the national level to form the United Reformed Church, and the church and church hall buildings subsequently passed into other hands. Design and construction The Congregationalists recommended the appointment of Trevor Dannatt, the architect who had been responsible for the remodelling of their church in 1957. Ted Happold of Ove Arup was the structural engineer. Dannatt (a Congregationalist) and Happold (a Quaker) had recently worked together on the new assembly hall (also Grade II listed) at Bootham School. The job architect was David Greenwood. Construction finally took place between September 1971 and September 1972, and the first Meeting for Worship in the new building was held in October 1972. Parts of the building have since been renewed in the original idiom. A major refurbishment in 2013 paid particular attention to improved wheelchair access. Form The building is on two levels: the main entrance is on Lawn Terrace, which runs parallel to Independents Road and at a higher level, and there is a lower entrance from Independents Road. It links to the former church hall, but access between the two buildings no longer exists. Viewed from the main road (Blackheath Village), the building forms \\"an arresting termination to the road [sc. Independents Road]\\".Cherry, Bridget, and Pevsner, Nikolaus, The Buildings of England, London 2: South, 1983, 416–17. . (The construction dates given are incorrect.) The main structure enclosing the meeting room on the upper level is in board-marked concrete, square in plan with chamfered corners, supporting a pyramidal roof topped by a square lantern. Its relationship to the adjacent church hall recalls that of a chapter house with a cathedral—an impression reinforced by its octagonal shape, as seen in several English chapter houses. The structure is rotated by about 45 degrees in order to minimise interference with the light to the church hall. At the corners the concrete wall is extended upwards to form \\"turrets\\". The structure has resemblances to Dannatt's Bootham School assembly hall: it rests on five concrete piers, and the walls function as beams supporting the floor. The trussed roof structure, with exposed timber compression struts and steel tension members carrying the lantern, is somewhat simpler, having been designed to be within the competence of a carpenter. The external covering is terne-coated stainless steel (originally zinc). Interior of main meeting roomInternally, the meeting room is a near-square space 9 m × 9 m, intended to seat up to 100 in the usual chair arrangement. Here the non-structural inner leaf of the wall is in plastered blockwork. Installed on the advice of an acoustics consultant, a blockwork sub-wall prevents the space being perfectly square. The ceiling and lantern are lined with Kara Sea redwood, and the floor is cork tiles. To the west of the meeting room, a large lobby and essential services (kitchen, toilet, storage) are enclosed by a cavity wall in stock brick and have a flat roof. The brick walls are mainly plastered, but the concrete of the main meeting room is also visible, and other walls are in blockwork or exposed brick. The route between the main entrance and the meeting room involves a turn of at least 180 degrees. (In plan, the meeting room and the lobby form a large letter Q.) The sense of progress along the route is emphasised by changes in the wall angles and progressively increasing ceiling heights—and, in the original colour scheme, by paint colours that changed gradually from dark grey to white. At the end of the route lies a soaring light-filled space extending more than 7.5 m upwards. Ceiling, lantern and luminairesThe meeting room is lit principally by the lantern, with additional light supplied by skylights in each of the corner turrets. Otherwise the space has only a single window at low level, which \\"provides the visitor with a view of the street he has just come from – a means of reorientation after the spiral journey\\".Architectural Review, Vol. 9 (1974) 266–9 Artificial light comes from four light fittings below the lantern and from fluorescent tubes in the four skylights. The special light fittings were designed by the architect, and echo the shape of the room; originally made from offcuts of the zinc roof covering, they have been reconstructed in stainless steel. Seating mainly takes the form of separate wooden chairs, but some wooden benches from earlier meeting houses have been retained. Surface finishes in the building express the Quaker testimony of simplicity. The architect's inclusion of a Christian symbol is highly unusual in Quaker meeting houses. Eastern elevation seen from Independents RoadAt the lower level a long \\"committee room\\" or classroom, opening off a lobby, can be divided into two unequal halves by a retractable screen. The lobby also gives access to toilets, kitchen and storage areas. Parking spaces were provided within the curtilage to meet Local Authority requirements. In front of the southern aspect, the cobbled area was originally separated from the Lawn Terrace pavement by wooden posts. In 2010 this area became a Peace Garden, with a separating wall, steel railings and new plantings.Information leaflet issued by Blackheath Quaker Meeting for Open House London Awards The building received a Civic Trust award in 1973 and a Concrete Society commendation in 1974. The Civic Trust citation refers to \\"a good neighbourly building where the architectural concept is enhanced by the quality of detailing and workmanship of the finished product\\". In May 2019, together with several other Quaker meeting houses, the building was awarded Grade II listing by Historic England.Ella Jessel (13 May 2019). \\"Dannatt’s 1970s Blackheath Quaker Meeting House among new listings\\".

It was the first building with permanent foundations to be completed in the future capital, and initially served as a farmers' meeting place. The House of Peasants, as it was known, was the venue where Tajik politician Nusratullo Makhsum declared the creation of the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic in October 1929. The building was by turns the venue of Tajikistan's first cinema, its first modern library, first public reading rooms, first theater, first radio broadcasting center, first driving school and first home to the Pioneers youth movement. In its latter years, it was the home of the city's Mayakovsky theatre company. At the outbreak of the Tajik civil war in the 1990s, the company moved temporarily to Magnitogorsk in Russia. After the war, it was Tajikistan’s last surviving Russian-language theatre company with the Mayakovsky as its home.

The fair moved to Hastings, the county seat, and then to permanent grounds near Farmington in 1918. The Horticulture Building When the permanent fairgrounds were established in 1918, one of the first structures built was the Horticulture Building. The building, designed and built by C. S. Lewis, had a central section flanked by two 40-foot wings. The central section was topped by a wooden octagonal dome which was painted silver. The building was constructed of wood and red clay tiles, and was considered an example of early twentieth-century fairgrounds architecture. In 1980, the Horticulture Building was added to the National Register of Historic Places. By 1984, the dome had begun to lean to one side and it was feared that it could blow over in a storm. County fair officials decided that the cost of restoration would be too high and the building was razed in 1988. A replacement building was constructed and the old dome was turned into a gazebo on the fairgrounds. In 1993, the Exhibition Hall was removed from the National Register of Historic Places.

Four months later it became the first opposition publication in the Soviet-dominated Eastern Europe to be allowed by the authorities. History In the Communist countries, all publications needed a government license, in Poland called debit, and were subject to prior restraint. The rise of Solidarność created a kind of grey zone: hundreds of local bulletins were launched without \\"debits\\", thus formally illegal, yet rarely prosecuted. Jedność (full title: Nasz rodowód – sierpień ’80 JEDNOŚĆ, Our origin - August 1980 UNITY) was initially published and distributed in the Szczecin region in this way. Unlike others, Jedność chief editor Leszek Dlouchy applied for a debit and surprisingly received it soon, with the first fully legal edition published on 3 January 1981. The countrywide Tygodnik Solidarność, the official weekly of the free union's National Coordination Committee, had to wait until May for its \\"debit\\". Both papers struggled with the censors who would often ban half of a planned issue, and a sequence of dashes in square brackets, [----], marking the cuts, was often seen in each article. Yet the debit spelled the right of sale in kiosks of the monopolist, state-owned Ruch, while underground and grey zone bulletins could only be distributed hand-to-hand. Out of 100,000 Jedność copies printed weekly, half was meant for Szczecin and the region, while union members in the national railway PKP would distribute the other half to several Polish cities. Jedność attracted several prominent Polish authors and illustrators, the most notable being Andrzej Mleczko. The legal existence of both Jedność and Tygodnik Solidarność ended on 13 December 1981, when the Communists declared martial law in Poland. Jedność continued in the underground until the fall of Communism in 1989.

Their tuath comprised at least the barony of Dunmore, in County Galway. Origin The Conmhaicne or Conmaicne were an people of early Ireland, perhaps related to the Laigin, who dispersed to various parts of Ireland. They settled in Connacht and Longford, giving their name to several Conmaicne territories. Other branches of Conmaicne were located in County Galway, Roscommon, Mayo, and Leitrim. Territory Early peoples and kingdoms of Ireland, c.800 Knox stated the tuath comprised the barony of Dunmore, part of Ballymoe, and at least Belclare parish. However O'Donovan says the territory comprised only the barony of Dunmore. Conmaicne Dunmore was centred about the present town of Dunmore, County Galway (burnt in 1249, 1284, and 1315, and walled in 1280), which is bounded by rising land in the north, and bogland east and west. Moated sites were situated some distance to the south and west of Dunmore, at Darrary North, Carrow-munniagh, and south-west at Doonbally. A possible deserted village was located south-west at Castletown. Settlement was seemingly concentrated in the south-east part of Cenel Dhubhain. Septs From 800 AD the Ui Briuin Ai were the dominant tribe of Connaught, settling clans ('the Silmurray') in various tuaths, including among the Conmaicne Dunmore. The Castle of Dunmore in Conmaicne Cinel Dubhain, was later called Dun Mor Fheorais. Patrican link In the original Vita tripartita Sancti Patricii, Tírechán said Saint Patrick travelled through Conmaicne Dunmore to Conmaicne Cuile Tolad. Churches of Patrician origin in Conmaicne Dunmore were not identified. Abbey The abbey at Dun-more, a friary of the Order of Saint Augustine, was established by Anglo-Normans in 1425.

Among these are the Skhirat agreement of December 2015 and the plans for the Libyan National Conference in April 2019 that were delayed because of the 2019–20 Western Libya campaign. In July 2019, Ghassan Salamé, the head of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL), proposed a three-point peace plan, to consist of a ceasefire, an international meeting of implicated countries for enforcing the arms embargo and an internal Libyan conference composed of economic, military and political \\"tracks\\". A several- day ceasefire took place on Eid al-Adha in mid-August 2019 and a ceasefire was declared by both the Government of National Accord (GNA) and the Libyan National Army (LNA) to start on 12 January 2020. A conference between representatives of Mediterranean Basin powers implicated in the Libyan armed conflict as well as Algeria, the Republic of Congo and major world powers took place in Berlin on 19 January 2020, declaring a 55-point list of Conclusions, creating a military 5+5 GNA+LNA followup committee, and an International Follow-up Committee to monitor progress in the peace process. In the intra- Libyan component of the 3-point process, the economic track was launched on 6 January 2020 in a meeting in Tunis between a diverse selection of 19 Libyan economic experts. The military track of the intra-Libyan negotiations started on 3 February with the 5+5 Libyan Joint Military Commission meeting in Geneva, between 5 senior military officers selected by the GNA and 5 selected by the LNA leader Khalifa Haftar. A major aim was to negotiate detailed monitoring to strengthen the 12 January ceasefire. The intra-Libyan political track was started on 26 February 2020 in Geneva. Salamé resigned from his UNSMIL position in early March 2020. A 21 August 2020 announcement by GNA leader Fayez al-Sarraj and Aguila Saleh for the LNA declared a ceasefire, lifting of the oil blockade, the holding of parliamentary and presidential elections in March 2021, and a new joint presidential council to be guarded by a joint security force in Sirte. Followup meetings took place in Montreux on 7–9 September with support from UNSMIL and the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue and, between five GNA and five House of Representatives (HoR) members on 11 September, in Bouznika. Both meetings appeared to achieve consensus. 2015 Skhirat agreement During the first half of 2015, the United Nations facilitated a series of negotiations seeking to bring together the rival governments of Libya and warring militias tearing Libya apart. The U.N. representative to Libya reconvened delegations from Libya's rival governments on 8 June 2015 to present the latest draft proposal for a unity government for the war-torn country. After a warning one week earlier that the country was running out of money and had risked ceasing to be a functional state, Bernardino León urged at a ceremony in Morocco that the Libyans approve the fourth version of the proposal. On 8 October 2015, Bernardino León held a press conference in which the names of several potential members of a unified government were announced. In November 2015, The Guardian claimed that Bernardino León's neutrality had been compromised by his having negotiated and accepted a £1,000-a-day job to head a thinktank in the United Arab Emirates during the time of his role as the main UN peace negotiator in Libya. A meeting between the rival governments was held at Auberge de Castille in Valletta, Malta on 16 December 2015. The meeting was delayed for a few days after the representatives from the Tobruk government initially failed to show up. The leader of the Tripoli government, Nouri Abusahmain, announced that they \\"will not accept foreign intervention against the will of the Libyan people,\\" while the leader of the Tobruk government Aguila Saleh Issa called on the international community to \\"allow [them] time to form an effective unity government.\\" Representatives from both governments also met officials from the United Nations, Italy, the United States and Russia in a conference in Rome. On 17 December 2015, delegates from both rival governments signed a peace deal backed by the UN in Skhirat, Morocco, although there was opposition to this within both factions. The Government of National Accord was formed as a result of this agreement, and its first meeting took place in Tunis on 2 January 2016. On 17 December 2017, general Khalifa Haftar declared the Skhirat agreement void. 2018 Palermo Conference The Palermo Conference was a two- day international conference which took place in Palermo, Italy on 12–13 November 2018 to support the holding of the Libyan National Conference and national elections in 2019. 2019 Libyan National Conference A meeting, called the Libyan National Conference, was planned in Ghadames for organising elections and a peace process in Libya. The conference was prepared over 18 months during 2018 and 2019 and was planned to take place 14–16 April 2019. It was postponed in early April 2019 as a result of the attack on Tripoli by the Libyan National Army under the command of Khalifa Haftar. Salamé three-point peace plan On 29 July 2019, Ghassan Salamé, head of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL), proposed a three-point peace plan to the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), which would \\"require consensus in [the UNSC] and amongst the Member States who exert influence on the ground\\" and require Libyans \\"to listen to their better angels\\" rather than \\"[fight] the wars of others and in so doing [destroy] their country.\\" Salamé resigned from his UNSMIL position in early March 2020, stating that the governments of countries involved in the Libyan conflict had failed to support the peace process, with numerous violations of the arms embargo. Salamé's plan included: # a truce between the Government of National Accord (GNA) and Libyan National Army (LNA) and their associated militias on Eid al-Adha, along with confidence-building measures such as prisoner exchanges, releasing arbitrarily detained prisoners and exchanging the remains of victims of the conflict; # an international meeting of countries implicated in the conflict, to stop the fighting, implement the legally existing arms embargo of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 (2011), and promote the following of international human rights law; # a Libyan meeting similar to the originally planned Libyan National Conference; which should include three tracks: #* an economic track, which started on 6 January 2020 among 19 diverse Libyan economic experts meeting in Tunis, and continued with a 9–10 February Cairo meeting which defined the terms of reference to create a Libyan Expert Economic Commission; #* a military track, which the 5+5 Libyan Joint Military Commission started during 3–8 February 2020 in Geneva, and continued 18–23 February in Geneva leading to a draft ceasefire agreement; and #* a political track for negotiation by 13 HoR members from the Tobruk and Tripoli based groups, 13 HCS members and 14 independents, which started with 20 out of the 40 participants on 26 February in Geneva. =Ceasefires= The first point of the Salamé three-point peace plan is a ceasefire. Eid al-Adha truce A truce took place on Eid al-Adha in mid-August 2019. Salamé described it as a \\"substantial reduction in violence along the main fronts in southern Tripoli and elsewhere\\" with \\"some violations\\" and that \\"broadly speaking, the truce held for the duration of the Eid festivities.\\" Salamé stated to the UNSC that UNSMIL was working on encouraging confidence-building measures and a longer term ceasefire. 12 January 2020 ceasefire In early January 2020, Turkish and Russian leaders proposed a Libyan ceasefire starting on 12 January. Russian president Vladimir Putin contacted United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Egpytian leaders to pressure Haftar into accepting a ceasefire from the side of the LNA. An LNA spokesperson stated on 12 January that the LNA would implement the ceasefire. The Libya Observer interpreted the LNA's decision to be a result of Russian pressure. Both sides claimed to have implemented the ceasefire, and that the other side had violated it. On 15 January, Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar stated that although Haftar had not signed a ceasefire deal in Moscow that al-Sarraj had signed, it was \\"too early\\" to judge if the ceasefire had failed. Libya Herald reported a \\"relative calm\\" with \\"some ceasefire violations\\" each day since 12 January. On 16 January, German representatives stated that Haftar was committed to the ceasefire. On 30 January, UNSMIL had documented 110 violations of the 12 January ceasefire. =Berlin conference= The second point of the Salamé three-point peace plan is to stop the arms flow into Libya, with an international conference to pressure countries implicated in the conflict to stop fuelling it. Preparations On 4 September 2019, Salamé stated to the UNSC that he had visited several countries in the region with the aim of organising an international conference that would fulfil the second element of his peace plan. He stressed that a central theme of the meeting would be respect for the arms embargo, a commitment to non-interference in Libya, and a commitment to supporting Libyans' view of the conflict and Libyans' preferences for a political solution to the conflict. Salamé argued that \\"the idea that war should be given a chance and that a military solution is at all possible is quite simply a chimera.\\" In mid-September, a preparation meeting was held in Berlin between representatives of Germany, the United States (US), France, United Kingdom (UK), Italy, Russia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Turkey, the Arab League, the European Union (EU), and the African Union (AU). According to Michel Cousins (co-founder of Libya Herald), as of early October, the plan was that no Libyans would participate in the conference, and participation of Qatar, Algeria and Tunisia remained unclear. On 8 October, Salamé stated that all countries concerned had to be invited \\"without any exclusion\\". The third Senior Official Meeting in preparation for the Berlin meeting took place on 21 October. On 27 October, during a visit by the German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas to Zuwara to discuss preparations for the Berlin conference, Salamé stated, \\"The Berlin conference efforts are very serious and are backed by very significant stakeholders. There must be a committee that would be tasked with following up on the implementation of all understandings and this is something all previous conferences have lacked.\\" The Libyan Foreign Minister, Mohamed Taha Siala, said that there should be a ceasefire and a retreat of LNA forces before negotiations. Maas stated that the peace process should be conducted without foreign intervention. The fourth Senior Official Meeting was planned for 20 November. Concrete aims of the Berlin meeting included a formal communiqué of intended actions (prepared as a draft communiqué during the Senior Official Meetings), an operational annex, and the creation of a committee to work with UNSMIL in implementing the aims of the communiqué and in \\"[playing] a fundamental role in terms of ensuring respect for a ceasefire and better implementation of the arms embargo.\\" At a fifth preparation meeting on 10 December 2019, two documents were \\"to a very large extent ready\\" to be proposed for signature by the political leaders expected to participate in the Berlin conference. Final preparation phase In early January 2020, Italian, Turkish, Russian and German political leaders expressed support for the Berlin conference, and for Algeria's participation in the conference in its role as a neighbouring country. German chancellor Angela Merkel confirmed 19 January 2020 as the date for the Berlin conference, to include representatives of the US, Russia, UK, France, the People's Republic of China, the UAE, Turkey, the Republic of Congo, Italy, Egypt, Algeria, and of the UN, the EU, the AU and the Arab League. GNA head al-Sarraj and LNA head Haftar were invited to the Berlin conference. Conference and Conclusions Anti-Haftar protest at the Berlin conference The Berlin conference was held on 19 January 2020 as planned. Al-Sarraj and Haftar were both present in Berlin, but didn't participate directly in the main talks, as they refused to be in the same room as one another. They were kept informed of the discussions. An anti-Haftar protest of 150 people was held in Berlin near the conference venue with posters including \\"Haftar kills Libyan children\\". The Libya Summit in Berlin, Germany on 19 January 2020 A six-page Conclusions document with 55 points covering the peace process was issued to represent the results of the conference. Point 5 of the document described the \\"sole objective\\" of the conference, termed the Berlin Process, as \\"assisting the United Nations in unifying the International Community in their support for a peaceful solution to the Libyan crisis\\" and committing the countries and international bodies present at the conference to support the 3-point Salamé peace plan. The document includes subsections on the components of the peace process: * the \\"ceasefire\\"; * the \\"arms embargo\\"; * an intra-Libyan \\"return to the political process\\" including the Skhirat agreement as a \\"viable framework\\"; * \\"security sector reform\\" for creating unified security, police and military forces under a single civilian authority \\"building upon the Cairo talks\\"; * \\"economic and financial reform\\"; * \\"respect for international humanitarian law and human rights\\"; * \\"follow-up\\", including the creation of a military \\"5+5\\" committee and an \\"International Follow-up Committee\\" (IFC). Point 51 of the Conclusions stated that Sarraj on behalf of the GNA and Haftar on behalf of the LNA had already nominated their respective representatives on the military 5+5 committee. Points 54, 55 and 56 defined the International Follow-up Committee to \\"[consist] of all countries and International Organisations that participated in [the] Berlin Conference on Libya in order to maintain coordination ... under the aegis of the United Nations\\". The IFC is required to meet monthly to track progress in the implementation of the Conclusions, and to have four technical working groups to meet twice a month to \\"address obstacles to implementation\\" and to share information and coordinate. Arms embargo On 25 January, UNSMIL reported violations of the arms embargo, stating that during the previous ten days, \\"numerous cargo and other flights [had] been observed landing at Libyan airports in the western and eastern parts of the country providing the parties with advanced weapons, armoured vehicles, advisers and fighters.\\" A confidential report sent to the United Nations Security Council in September 2020 stated that eight countries had violated the embargo. According to the report, the United Arab Emirates and Russia were sent five cargo aircraft filled with weapons to Libya on 19 February 2020, the day of the Berlin conference. The New York Times described this as \\"blatant\\" hypocrisy. Four of these aircraft were sent from the UAE and one from Russia. Turkish transport of military resources to Libya constituted another major violation of the arms embargo. =Intra-Libyan preparations= The third point of the Salamé three-point peace plan is intra- Libyan negotiations without external interference along economic, military and political tracks in parallel. In support of internal Libyan conflict resolution infrastructure, UNSMIL held three mediation workshops for 97 Libyan men and 23 Libyan women, with the aim of creating a national network of mediators including \\"tribal leaders, elders, representatives of civil society, youth and women activists, academics and businesspeople, who enjoy credibility and respect amongst their various constituencies.\\" On 11 January, Stephanie Williams, deputy head of UNSMIL for political affairs, discussed with Khalid al-Mishri, head of the High Council of State (HCS), inviting the HCS to a late-January meeting between the HCS and the House of Representatives (HoR) in Geneva for the purposes of \\"resuming dialogue\\". Economic track =6 January= On 6 January 2020, Ghassan Salamé coordinated a meeting in Tunis among nineteen Libyan economic experts intended to represent the main Libyan financial and economic institutions and sectors and a wide range of political interests and geographical regions. Salamé stated UNSMIL's aim of starting all three of the economic, military and political \\"Libyan-led\\" tracks of negotiations in January 2020. He stated that the 6 January meeting constituted the start of the economic track. =9–10 February= The economic/financial track was scheduled to continue in Cairo on 9 February. According to The Libya Observer, groups called the Tripolitanian Society and the National Assembly for Seventeenth February Revolutionaries objected to hosting any intra-Libyan talks in Cairo because of Egypt's role in supporting the LNA. The issue of \\"fair distribution or redistribution of the State revenues\\" in relation to the Libyan oil industry and the concerns of tribal chiefs who in late January blocked several Libyan oil terminals was set as a high priority issue for the 9 February meeting. At the 9–10 February Cairo meeting, the participants agreed on the terms of reference defining a Libyan Expert Economic Commission and its operations. The Commission aims to have three working groups for \\"revenue management and distribution\\", transparency, decentralisation, the Libyan banking crisis, and reconstruction and development. The following meeting of the economic/financial track was proposed for early March. Military track On 7 January 2020, Salamé expressed hope that negotiations on the military and security track would start within the following fortnight. These would cover a ceasefire, the arms embargo, disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR), and \\"terrorism and counterterrorism\\". At the 19 January Berlin conference, a military \\"5+5 committee\\" proposed by UNSMIL, with 5 members appointed each by Sarraj and Haftar, was defined in point 51 of the Conclusions of the conference. The 10 members were named at the conference and were expected to start meeting the following week. Salamé considers the 5+5 committee to be part of the military track. On 20 January, he described the main task of the committee as \\"[working] on sending away foreign fighters from Libya as soon as possible\\". =JMC membership= , the head of GNA's five members of the 5+5 Libyan Joint Military Commission (JMC) is Ahmed Abu Shahma. Ali Hamed al-Lamaoui, a political representative of a brigade of the Toubou people from the south of Libya, stated that , the JMC excluded \\"the Libyan majority from constructing solutions\\", with four of the five GNA representatives being from Zintan, Misrata, Tripoli and Zawiya. Al-Lamaoui was sceptical of the representativity of the GNA five and of the chances of the JMC coming to agreement. =3–8 February= The 5+5 committee, formally named the 5+5 Libyan Joint Military Commission, started meeting in Geneva on 3 February in talks facilitated by Salamé. The committee consists of 5 senior military officers chosen by the GNA and 5 senior military officers chosen by Haftar. Topics of negotiation on 4 February included practical details of ceasefire monitoring, including the types of monitors, the roles of Libyan authorities and the UN and what \\"kind of action should be taken in terms of heavy weaponry\\". The priority was that the monitoring decisions should be taken by Libyans. An EU proposal to provide ceasefire monitors was scheduled to be considered later during the week. On 6 February, the tentative monitoring plan, accepted by both sides, was for the 5+5 committee to \\"be involved\\" in the ceasefire monitoring \\"under the auspices of UNSMIL\\"; ceasefire details remained under discussion. The two sides did not meet face-to-face. The result of the early February meeting from the two sides was consensus on several principles, including the defence of Libyan territory, Libyan independence from international interference, opposition to \\"UN-identified terrorist groups (al-Qaeda, ISIS, Ansar al-Sharia)\\", and support for an existing UNSMIL committee's role in exchanges of prisoners and the returns of mortal remains. The two sides agreed to continue negotiating to reach a \\"comprehensive ceasefire agreement\\". UNSMIL proposed 18 February for the following round ot talks. =18–23 February= The 5+5 Libyan Joint Military Commission started its second round of negotiations in Geneva on 18 February. Salamé described the type of questions to be discussed to include, \\"What kind of monitoring do you need? Who is going to do it on the ground? Are they going to be unarmed? What will happen to the other weapons? What will happen to non-regular fighters? What will happen to areas that are overbuilt, I mean very urbanized in the city of Tripoli, I mean who is going to be in charge of the police ...\\" The GNA declared that it withdrew from the talks after the port of Tripoli was shelled by the LNA. The talks continued on 20 February and concluded on 23 February. The JMC participants agreed on a draft ceasefire declaration for civilians to return to their places of residence and defining a joint ceasefire monitoring mechanism to be managed by UNSMIL and the JMC, to be proposed to the GNA and LNA leaders. A third meeting was scheduled for March to finalise the terms of reference of sub-committees responsible for implementing the agreement. Political track On 7 January 2020, Salamé stated his expectation that the political dialogue track would start by late January, possibly at the Palace of Nations in Geneva. At the 19 January Berlin conference, the GNA and LNA agreed to participate in a Geneva meeting on the political track \\"soon\\". On 20 January, Salamé stated that the late-January meeting would include thirteen representatives of the House of Representatives (HoR) and thirteen of the High Council of State (HCS); and \\"independent persons\\" including women and minority representatives. The political track negotiations would be open to \\"all issues\\", including the 2017 draft Libyan constitution, electoral laws and dates and \\"maybe\\" an agreement on holding elections in a nationally unified way. On 30 January, Salamé stated that the GNA representatives agreed to participate in dialogue, and that there were \\"deep divisions\\" in the HoR \\"hindering\\" the HoR's choice of reprensentatives. On 4 February, Salamé stated that he expected the political track dialogue to start mid-February. On 4–5 February, the HCS and the Tripoli component of the HoR conditioned their representatives' participation in the Geneva political track meeting to \\"the success of the military track\\", to the strengthening of the ceasefire and to the return of the LNA to its positions prior 4 April 2019. On 6 February, Salamé stated that the political track was expected to be launched on 26 February in Geneva with 40 participants. The political track membership was later clarified to be defined as 13 HoR representatives, 13 HCS representatives and 14 \\"independent\\" persons selected by UNSMIL. Independent participants included former Education Minister Othman Abdul Jalil, Interior Minister Fathi Bashagha, former head of the HCS Abdulrahman Sewehli and Abdullah Othman. Libya Herald described Othman as a \\"former regime figure\\" suspected of involvement with the Muslim Brotherhood#Libya. The HCS and the Tripoli-based branch of the HoR stated on 24 February that they would boycott the political track negotiations until the military track made significant progress. The Tobruk-based branch of the HoR wished all of the 13 HoR representatives to be those from the Tobruk branch and objected to UNSMIL's acceptance of 5 HoR representatives selected by the Tripoli-based HoR group. The Tobruk group stated that it would boycott the political track meeting unless all of its 13 selected people were accepted as participants and described the UNSMIL's refusal to accept the full 13 as \\"intervention\\" in decision-making. =26 February= The political track was launched on 26 February in Geneva among 20 Libyan participants from the HoR, from both the Tobruk-based and Tripoli-based parts of the HoR, and from the independent persons' group. The first day of the talks started with negotiations on the structure and agenda of the talks and with the creation of a drafting committee. UNSMIL said that absent invitees would join the talks later. August/September 2020 ceasefire and negotiations A ceasefire and negotiations restarted in August/September 2020, during roughly the same period as the 2020 Libyan protests in both GNA and LNA controlled cities. =21 August ceasefire declaration= A major step in the post-Salamé phase of negotiations started on 21 August 2020 with al-Sarraj for the GNA and Aguila Saleh for the LNA jointly announcing a ceasefire and calling for the lifting of the oil blockade, for a new presidential council to be established temporarily in Sirte, for parliamentary and presidential elections to be held in March 2021, and for joint deployment of security forces in Sirte to guard a new presidential council. =September negotiations= Negotiations continued during 7–9 September in Montreux among unnamed \\"key Libyan stakeholders\\", with the support of UNSMIL and the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue. The participants agreed on an 18-month time scale for holding parliamentary and presidential elections, on implementing an amnesty to be approved by the parliament, on supporting the return of internally displaced people and the diaspora, and on moving several government functions to Sirte. UNSMIL stated that it would help to support a \\"[resumption of] the fully inclusive Libyan Political Dialogue Forum\\". On 11 September in Bouznika, Libyan Dialogue discussions continued between five members of the GNA and five members of the HoR, including Idris Omran of the HoR. Omran stated that the group had agreed on \\"the criteria, transparent mechanisms and objectives\\" for key national roles. According to Libyan media, roles under debate included the heads of the central bank, of the National Oil Corporation and of the armed forces. Economic track The third meeting of the economic track of negotiations, including 29 Libyan economic experts, together with representatives from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the World Bank and Stephanie Williams of UNSMIL as chair, was held virtually on 18 September 2020, using hubs in Tripoli, Benghazi and Sebha. Discussion topics included an \\"audit of the two branches of the Central Bank of Libya\\" and the setting of a precedent for further online meetings. Libyan Political Dialogue Forum The political track of negotiations took the name Libyan Political Dialogue Forum (LPDF), to take place both online and face-to-face, starting in October 2020. UNSMIL, based on a \\"recommendation from a great majority of Libyan constituencies\\", set a condition that participation in the LPDF would require participants to declare themselves ineligible for positions of political or \\"sovereign\\" power in the new institutions to be created. LPDF virtual meetings were planned to start on 26 October 2020, and face-to-face meetings were planned to start in Tunisia in early November 2020. Meetings between Williams and Libyan mayors from the West, South and East of Libya started in mid-October.

Additionally, 2b2t's world is one of the longest- running unaltered server maps in the game, which has never been reset since its creation. As the server has virtually no rules or authority, griefing and hacking are common amongst players, with no risk of getting banned. The server is set to \\"hard\\" difficulty, and player versus player combat is possible at all times and locations. The server has seen over 510,000 players explore its procedurally-generated map, increasing its file size to over 8 terabytes. 2b2t has been described in news media as the worst Minecraft server due to its playerbase and culture. History alt=An aerial render of the spawn region in July 2019, displaying the extreme amount of destruction and modification carried out to the terrain, including the construction of massive structures, such as the prominent An aerial render of the spawn region in July 2019, centered on the middle of the map with a diameter of just over 4,000 blocks. The render displays the extreme amount of destruction and modification carried out to the terrain, including the construction of massive structures, such as the prominent Square and Compasses (upper right). In a Rock, Paper, Shotgun article by Brendan Caldwell, 2b2t player James Rustles stated about the server's origin: The 2b2t Minecraft server was founded in late December 2010. The founders are anonymous, choosing to remain unknown or known only via usernames; the most prominent founder is commonly referred to as Hausemaster, HauseMaster, or Hausmaster. After being asked by Vice journalist Andrew Paul via email in 2015, the server operator stated: The server was advertised shortly after its creation on online forums such as 4chan, Facepunch Studios', and Reddit, whose users populated the server by the hundreds due to the total freedom it offered. Members from different forums raided each other and their bases on the server. The founders eventually stopped playing Minecraft, though the server remained online due to the large player base that had been formed. The server operator is relatively hands-off in administrating the server. In June 2013, the file size of 2b2t's world map, which is procedurally generated, was reported to be over 500 gigabytes. In October 2015, storage usage had increased to almost 800 gigabytes, with the server costing US$90 a month to maintain. On June 1, 2016, YouTuber 'TheCampingRusher' uploaded a YouTube video of himself playing on 2b2t. This caused a massive influx of new players from the channel's audience, as the video gained over two million views in less than four months from its upload. The sudden influx overwhelmed the server and strained the hardware used to host and run it. A loose group of older players came together against these new players. Although the new players, who called themselves \\"Rushers\\", largely outnumbered the older players at the time, these older players had years of experience and resources. Some older players deterred new players by destroying the spawn-in area to make it uninhabitable and extremely challenging to proceed from. Some players built in-game contraptions designed solely to overload the server, with the intent of making it difficult for TheCampingRusher and his fans to play on it. Some placed obscene content around the spawn area and along player-built roads in an attempt to get TheCampingRusher's YouTube videos taken down due to violations of YouTube's terms of service. The new players, despite having been discouraged to do so by TheCampingRusher, had destroyed bases and monuments on the server that had stood for years, which is partially what had caused such a response from the player base. In response to the inundated server and hardware, a queue to enter the server was added. The queue gave earlier 2b2t players a priority over the newer players, although this feature was removed after a year. The regular queue moves slowly and can contain over a thousand players; waiting in it has been described as an \\"onerous\\" task. Players can pay $20 to access a separate, \\"priority\\" queue for one month. As of July 2020, the file size of 2b2t's map has increased to more than 8 terabytes from over 510,000 unique players, according to the server's official subreddit sidebar. Culture Two \\"lava casts\\" built to help block the way for new players from spawn (upper left) to the rest of the map (lower right) The culture of 2b2t and anarchy servers in general have been described as \\"inhospitable\\" and \\"nihilistic\\". The server is known as the worst Minecraft server. Players usually need to hide supplies, be armed, and expect to be killed several times. This is exacerbated by the server being set to \\"hard\\" difficulty and player versus player combat being enabled, making survival considerably harder. Longtime players are often hostile to new players on the server, whom they call \\"newfags\\". The server-wide chat often contains spam, trolling, and trash-talking, as well as racial slurs, death threats, and Nazi propaganda. Links to obscene content and screamer videos are also common. Players often lie to others with the intent of sending them to in-game locations with traps. A common rule among players is to not trust others. Traps are deliberately placed surrounding the area where players first join the server: pits of lava, areas lit on fire, and portals that lead to lava or enclosed areas of obsidian that force players to disconnect and reconnect, waiting through the queue again. Some players create large obstacles called \\"lava casts\\", in which water and lava are repeatedly poured down staircases of stone, creating mountains of jagged stone. These structures surround the spawn area and are as tall as the map's height limit. There have occasionally been events referred to as \\"spawn incursions\\", in which dozens of players come together to take control of spawn for a time, in order to build a large base, kill many new players, or destroy other bases. Inexperienced players may need many attempts and multiple hours to escape the spawn area. The most common cause of death on the server is starvation from being unable to escape the spawn area. A player may last around 1,500 blocks of travel without food before dying of starvation. Roisin Kiberd of Newsweek speculated that enduring the challenge may be part of the appeal of 2b2t: since \\"nobody survives for long, there is a pride in having died there.\\" Experienced players reside far away from the spawn area in relative safety to play the game and build. The map is less destroyed further away from spawn, allowing for trees and animals. Player-built roads are used to travel out from spawn. The server has no etiquette regarding ownership; anything that is built belongs to the builder and can be destroyed at any time if found by other players. This destruction, known as griefing, is so commonplace on the server that Brendan Caldwell of Rock, Paper, Shotgun described it as being \\"just a form of weather\\". Despite this culture of hostility and destruction, there is an event every April Fools' Day in which the server changes to a different map for a few days and players can come together and cooperate. Players often use a \\"hacked client\\", which is an altered version of Minecraft featuring abilities that are not in the default game client, such as X-ray vision, improved bow aim, and radar. These clients are necessary to navigate the environment and survive. Players without these clients are at a disadvantage. Reception = News media = 2b2t is known as the worst Minecraft server. Both Robert Guthrie of Kotaku and Andrew Paul of Vice have named the server the worst in Minecraft. Paul described the server as a \\"fantastical world of possibility and horror.\\" Brendan Caldwell of Rock, Paper, Shotgun described 2b2t as the game's \\"most obscene server.\\" In June 2012, Craig Pearson of PCGamesN called it Minecrafts most offensive server, noting 2b2t's callousness and obscenity in the form of language, swastikas, and its hostile player base. In 2013, a PCGamesN article by Jeremy Peel announced Minecrafts built-in server hosting service, Minecraft Realms, and mentioned that it would keep children away from 2b2t, an implication of the server's unsafe environment. In 2014, Tim Edwards wrote in a PCGamesN article addressing Microsoft about their purchase of Minecraft that they shouldn't get \\"prissy\\" about player-made creations, stating that \\"2b2t is still an amazing achievement, with or without the swastikas.\\" In both Newsweek and The Independent, Roisin Kiberd described 2b2t as a malevolent form of Minecraft, a place of beauty and terror. Kiberd called the server \\"hell\\", stating that it is \\"not safe for life\\", as the server gives \\"free rein to [players'] darkest impulses.\\" Kiberd concluded that the main appeal of playing on the server comes from learning the possibilities of a server with few limits, as well as enduring its hostile environment. A 2013 IGN article and video listed 2b2t's spawn area as one of the six best things in Minecraft, describing the server as the \\"end boss\\" of Minecraft servers, a celebration of destruction and indifference. The article noted 2b2t's propensity towards griefing, the use of hacked clients, and player-built obscenities; and stated that players with a thick skin should visit 2b2t at least once. Comparing the mannerisms of those on 2b2t to instances of religious violence in the real world, Katherine Apostolacus described the anarchic nature of 2b2t as how Minecraft was meant to be played. She described how a rich history has developed within the server since its founding, with the cataloging of events within 2b2t finding an audience beyond those who have played on the server. =Books= In Introduction to Game Design, Prototyping, and Development, published by Pearson Education in June 2014, 2b2t was described as being a \\"barren hellscape\\", with its nature being the \\"ultimate expression of the core mechanic of the game,\\" referring to Minecraft's open-ended sandbox nature. The Ultimate Minecraft Creator, published by Triumph Books in July 2014, stating that despite 2b2t's offensive language and behavior, griefing, and cheating, the server can be fun for some players: Master Builder 3.0 Advanced and Ultimate Guide to Mastering Minigames and Servers, published by Triumph Books in April 2015 and April 2016 respectively, both stated that 2b2t \\"sits among online royalty when it comes to public [Minecraft] servers.\\" Renders File:ThebesAndSound 2b2t Layers of Spawn Render Late 2017.pngA render of 2b2t's spawn region as of late 2017, displaying the various layers of spawn with progressive destruction proceeding inwards toward the center of the world.

In contrast to surgical options for this purpose, such as hysterectomy or endometrial ablation, hormonal methods to manipulate menstruation are reversible. There are a number of medical conditions for which fewer menstrual periods and less blood loss may be beneficial. In addition, suppression of hormonal cyclicity may benefit menstrual-related mood disorders or other conditions which increase in frequency with menses. Management of menstruation may be a challenge for those with developmental delay or intellectual disability, and menstrual suppression can benefit individuals with specific job or activity-related needs. There is increasing attention being given to menstrual suppression for individuals who were assigned female at birth, but whose gender identity is male, and who may experience dysphoria with menstruation. Menstrual suppression is also being used by individuals with a variety of personal reasons to have less frequent or no menses, including honeymoon, vacations, travel, or other specific reasons. Most options for the suppression of menstrual bleeding are not immediately 100% effective, and with many options, unscheduled bleeding (termed \\"breakthrough bleeding\\") can occur; for many options for menstrual suppression, breakthrough bleeding becomes less frequent with time.  Medical uses Hormonal therapies to reduce or stop menstrual bleeding have long been used to manage a number of gynecologic conditions including menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhea), heavy menstrual bleeding, irregular or other abnormal uterine bleeding, menstrual-related mood changes (Premenstrual Syndrome/PMS or Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder/PMDD), and pelvic pain due to endometriosis or uterine fibroids. Medical conditions that are associated with anemia or excessive blood loss, including sickle cell disease, iron deficiency anemia, Fanconi anemia, von Willebrand disease, low platelets (thrombocytopenia) from immune thrombocytopenia, or other blood/hematologic disorders such as clotting factor deficiencies could all benefit from menstrual suppression. In patients with malignancies who will receive chemotherapy that could result in low blood counts or anemia, or individuals with recurrent malignancies who will receive a stem cell transplant, excessive menstrual bleeding during this treatment could be medically serious, and thus menstrual suppression might be indicated. In addition, there are a number of other medical conditions with menstrual exacerbation that may benefit from menstrual suppression, including catamenial seizures, menstrual migraine headaches, irritable bowel syndrome, asthma . Menstrual hygiene issues, as in those individuals with developmental delay or intellectual disability or other manual dexterity or mobility/wheelchair challenges such as spina bifida or cerebral palsy may prompt an individual or caregiver to request menstrual suppression. Job or activity-related indications for menstrual suppression may include deployed military as occurred during Operation Desert Storm, travel, wilderness camping, or athletes with concerns about menses occurring during competition or training. There is also a growing recognition that some individuals who were at assigned female at birth, but who now identify as male (transgender men) or non-binary, may experience dysphoria with menses, and thus may request medical therapy for menstrual suppression.  Contraindications  The use of hormonal methods containing estrogen (combined oral contraceptives, the contraceptive patch or contraceptive ring), may be associated with risks that outweigh benefits for individuals with specific medical problems, such as migraine headaches with aura, a history of breast cancer, or a history of deep vein thrombosis.. Thus these options would be contraindicated for menstrual suppression with such conditions. Progestin-only options (depot medroxyprogesterone acetate, oral progestins) are appropriate for these individuals. Drug-drug interactions are also important to consider, particularly with combined hormonal options.  Safety  Because extended cycle regimens of combined hormonal contraceptives provide a greater cumulative dose of steroid hormones, questions have been raised about their safety. Data currently provide reassurance that these options are safe.  Options for menstrual suppression  = Combined hormonal contraceptives = The use of combined hormonal contraceptives (combined oral contraceptives, the contraceptive patch, and the contraceptive vaginal ring) are methods of contraception that contain both a synthetic estrogen and a synthetic form of progesterone. These methods have traditionally been used in a cyclic fashion, with three weeks (21 days) of hormones, followed by a 7-day hormone-free interval (with combined oral contraceptives, often with a week of placebo pills) during which time withdrawal bleeding or a hormonally-induced menstrual period occurs, mimicking an idealized spontaneous menstrual cycle. When these methods are taken without the hormone-free week, the withdrawal bleeding is reduced or eliminated. Thus extended cycle combined hormonal contraceptives are commonly used for menstrual suppression, although breakthrough bleeding is common in the initial months of use. (See also) The rate of amenorrhea (no bleeding) is in the range of 60% for users who are continuing to use combined hormonal contraceptive pills at the end of a year. = Progestin only contraceptives = Progestin only medications, including progestin only pills and a slow-release (depot) injectable medication, depot medroxyprogesterone acetate do not contain a synthetic estrogen. Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate is given as an injection every 90 days, and is typically associated with amenorrhea in about 50-60% of users at the end of one year. Progestins that are not typically used for birth control, such as norethindrone acetate, may be used to induce amenorrhea. = Hormonal Intrauterine Devices (IUDs) = Hormonal IUDs containing the hormone levonorgestrel have the side effect of inducing amenorrhea, and some types of hormonal IUDs have been shown to markedly decrease menstrual blood loss, and thus are efficacious in treating heavy and abnormal menstrual bleeding. The rate of amenorrhea after one year of use is in the range of 20-50%, although most users of the hormonal IUDs Mirena and Liletta experience a marked decrease in menstrual bleeding, which is beneficial and has led to reported high rates of user satisfaction. = Other options for menstrual suppression = Gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) analogs (both antagonists and agonists) are associated with amenorrhea, and have been used to induce therapeutic amenorrhea. Among oncologists caring for adolescents with cancer, GnRH analogs were the most commonly recommended treatment for menstrual suppression to prevent or treat heavy bleeding during therapy. The medication danocrine was once used for the treatment of endometriosis, and was associated with amenorrhea, but its use was limited by androgenic side-effects such as the potential for permanent lowering of the voice or hair growth. Because these side effects may be desired in transgender men, there has been some consideration of this option for menstrual population in this group of individuals.  Cultural issues  Historically, the concept that menstruation did not have beneficial effects, and that menstruation could be controlled was raised in the 1990s, by Dr. Elsimar Coutinho. The English language version, title, \\"Is Menstruation Obsolete: How suppressing menstruation can help women who suffer from anemia, endometriosis, or PMS?\\" was published in 1999. The concept that women can choose when and whether to menstruate has been debated. The Society for Menstrual Cycle Research maintains that menstruation is not a disease, and thus calls for more research on long-term effects of cycle- stopping contraceptives. Most evidence to date supports the safety of menstrual suppression.

Evacuation warnings are in place for the area between Ash Creek and Gottsville, warning to take \\"extreme caution\\" along Highway 96. Portions of Klamath National Forest are closed due to the fire. Events The Lime Fire was reported on September 4, 2019, around 11:30 a.m., west of Interstate 5 and north of Highway 96 in the Lime Gulch area of Klamath National Forest, about 10 miles north of Yreka. The fire was started by a lightning strike during a thunderstorm on Cottonwood Peak. Fire activity was erratic and hard to control, given that aviation support was moved to another, larger fire. Fire crews struggled to access the area of the fire, due to the extremely steep terrain, heavy fuels (dry brush and grass), and strong afternoon winds. On September 7, evacuation warnings were put in place for residences adjacent to the fire area. By September 8, an incident management team was onsite and suppression efforts continued. Helicopters and airplanes began dropping water and fire retardant. The fire and large columns of smoke became visible to drivers along Highway 96 and Interstate 5, the latter specifically in areas north of Yreka. National Forest land in footprint of the Lime Fire were closed in the Happy Camp/Oak Knoll Ranger District on September 12. On September 17, the Lime Fire burned and was 96 percent contained. Evacuations and closures On September 11, areas of Klamath National Forest were closed to the public, including the Happy Camp/Oak Knoll Ranger District and portions of the Klamath River, Empire Creek Road, Empire Creek, and all forest service roads in the Lime Fire Closure Area. Impact The Lime Fire threatened private timberlands and scattered residences in the area. A portion of National Forest land was closed to public use and residences near the burn area were under mandatory evacuation.

She is a member of the Democratic Party. Early life and career Coleman attended Mercer County High School in Harrodsburg, Kentucky, where she played basketball. She enrolled at Centre College to study history, and earned a bachelor's degree in 2004. While she attended Centre, she played college basketball for the Centre Colonels. She earned a master's degree in political science at the University of Louisville in 2008, serving as a graduate assistant on the Louisville Cardinals women's basketball team while she was enrolled. After graduating, Coleman became a social studies teacher at Burgin High School in Burgin, Kentucky, and coached the girl's basketball team. From 2008 through 2015, she coached and taught advanced government at East Jessamine High School in Nicholasville, Kentucky. Coleman ran in a 2014 election to represent the 55th district in the Kentucky House of Representatives as a member of the Democratic Party. She lost the election to Kimberly King, a Republican, by over 30% in a traditionally Republican- dominated district. Specifically, there was no Democratic candidate to win a race in the 55th district that day. In 2013, Coleman founded Lead Kentucky, a nonprofit organization focused on education policy reform. Inspired by Emerge Kentucky, the mission statement reads: \\"Lead Kentucky is a non-profit organization that recruits the best and brightest college women in the Bluegrass and empowers them to become the Commonwealth's next generation of leaders.\\" By focusing on leadership development of college aged women through emphasis on networking, finding a work/life balance, and overcoming obstacles (specifically in Kentucky), Coleman hopes that this program will empower women to take on roles that they may otherwise avoid. She became assistant principal at Nelson County High School in Bardstown, Kentucky in 2017, a position she held until her resignation in November 2019, following her election as lieutenant governor.

She moved to Cornell University as an assistant professor in 2019. Research Mann's research involves the symmetries of manifolds. She has made significant progress on a problem posed by Étienne Ghys: when the symmetries of one manifold act nontrivially on a second manifold, must the first manifold have smaller or equal dimension to the second one? She has also studied the rigidity of groups of symmetries of surfaces. Recognition In 2016, Mann won the Mary Ellen Rudin Award for \\"her deep and extensive work on homeomorphism groups of manifolds\\". The Association for Women in Mathematics gave Mann their 2019 Joan & Joseph Birman Research Prize in Topology and Geometry, for \\"major breakthroughs in the theory of dynamics of group actions on manifolds\\".

Van Eyken (born in Etterbeek) is a Belgian politician who represented the Union des Francophones in the Flemish Parliament from 1995 to 2019.  Biography  Van Eyken was born in the town of Etterbeek in the Brussels Capital Region in 1954. He studied at the Athénée royal de Bruxelles and the Université libre de Bruxelles, where he majored in German studies. Upon graduation in 1978, Van Eyken worked as a teacher and later as a translator for the Brussels government. He began his political career in 1983, when he became a community councilor in the town of Linkebeek, a position he held until 2006. In Linkebeek, he would serve as both the Échevin and the Mayor. In the first direct elections to the Flemish Parliament in 1995, Van Eyken was elected to the regional parliament as a member of the Union des Francophones for the Halle-Vilvoorde constituency. He would serve in that role until 2019, when he chose not to run again. Between 2007 and 2012, Van Eyken served as a local councilor and member of the police council for the town of Tervuren.  Marc Dellea Affair  On 8 July 2014, a coffee trader named Marc Dellea was found dead in his bed at the age of 45. His wife, Sylvia Boigelot, called the authorities following his death. A family doctor concluded that Dellea's death was by natural causes, but two days later a medical examiner found a small projectile in his brain, fired (according to ballistics experts) by a small defensive weapon. Investigators looking at surveillance footage from security cameras installed in the couple's home and found that Sylvia Boigelot and Christian Van Eyken entered the building on the evening of 6 July shortly before Dellea, and Dellea was the only one who did not leave the house. On 27 January 2016, prosecutors in Brussels issued an arrest warrant for Boigelot, Van Eyken's parliamentary assistant and his mistress. Van Eyken denied any involvement in the case. In an interview with Le Soir, Olivier Maingain, leader of the Francophone party DéFI, announced that Van Eyken had been suspended since 6 January 2016 concurrently with his parliamentary immunity being lifted. Van Eyken was released from custody on 28 January following a procedural error. According to reports, the judge in the case failed to sign Van Eyken's arrest warrant. His trial began in March 2018, after being delayed due to technical errors. The trial began with a procedural hearing involving whether the court had jurisdiction to try the case, and also concerned defense counsel's ability to look over evidence, including the surveillance tapes from the evening in question. On 3 September 2019, Van Eyken and Boigelot were found guilty of the murder of Marc Dellea and sentenced to 23 years in prison. Van Eyken and his wife appealed the verdict, and the case remains in appeals court.

Overview The site is located 3.5 kilometers from the confluence of the Omi River with the Kamo River and covers approximately 3 hectares. The site contained the foundations of pit dwellings from 3000 to 4000 years ago and an indeterminate number of tombs. Of note were a number of stone circles, one of which was 12 meters in diameter and contained elongated stones in its center which may once have been upright monoliths. Smooth river rocks were mostly used; however, some of the stones in the structure were polished to a flat surface. Outside of the stone circle, some 60 pits were discovered, containing a large number of artifacts, mostly pottery and earthenware. This included a clay token in the form of a human face. Some of these artifacts are now on display at the nearby Nakaizu Historical Museum. The site is open to the public as a park.

During his career, he refereed many major boxing fights and participated in a number of boxing related documentaries. Perez was active as a boxing referee during five decades; he oversaw fights between 1968 and 2005 and was both acclaimed and criticized among boxing's connoisseurs; he refereed 417 professional boxing fights, including many world title ones. Several of the matches he refereed involved world boxing champions and Hall of Fame members. Personal info Perez was born in Brooklyn, New York but lived in Puerto Rico as a youth before returning to New York. He currently lives in Barnegat Township, New Jersey. He was licensed to referee fights both in New York and in New Jersey. Perez started boxing as an amateur while in the United States Army, according to People Magazine. He was the Army's Caribbean area's Welterweight champion and then went to serve in Germany, where he obtained the Army's European command championship as well. One night at a fight his mother attended, he got a cut on one of his eyes, leading her to ask him to give up boxing. Perez got married and had a son, he then worked odd jobs until finding work at a Seagram's distillery as a salesman. It was then that he decided to return to boxing in the refereeing and judging capacities, but it took him several years to be assigned his first fight. Perez met his future wife, future boxing judge Barbara Perez, as they were both working at the Seagram's distillery.http://www.njboxinghof.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/BARBARA- PEREZ.jpg His wife lost a brother, who was a firefighter, during the September 11 attacks in 2001. She is a member of the New Jersey state's boxing hall of fame. Major fights refereed The first bout that Perez was assigned was the one between Buster Mathis and James J. Woody, which Mathis won by sixth-round technical knockout September 26, 1968 at the Madison Square Garden in New York. On May 26, 1969, Perez was the referee for the Dick Tiger versus Nino Benvenuti ten round non-title affair at the Madison Square Garden. Tiger won the fight by ten round unanimous decision; Perez was both the referee and one of the three judges for this fight and he scored it for Tiger 7-2-1; both Tiger and Benvenuti are now members of the International Boxing Hall of Fame. =First world title bout= The first world championship bout refereed by Perez was the Joe Frazier versus Jimmy Ellis main attraction on Monday, February 16, 1970, Ellis was the defending World Boxing Association's world Heavyweight champion with a record of 27 wins and 5 losses, 12 wins by knockout against Frazier, who was undefeated and untied in 24 bouts, with 20 knockout wins, and recognized (Frazier) as the world Heavyweight champion in the American states of Illinois, New York, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and Maine. This bout also took place at the Madison Square Garden. Frazier won the bout by fifth-round technical knockout after Ellis could not come out of his corner after the fourth round. Two weeks later, Perez was back in the ring to referee the bout between future world Middleweight champion Rodrigo Valdez of Colombia and ranked Puerto Rican Pete Toro, which Valdez lost by ten-round decision. On October 26, 1970, Perez was the referee in the bout between the comebacking Muhammad Ali, who was making his first fight after a three-year exile forced by boxing authorities over his refusal to join the United States Army in 1967, and California's Jerry Quarry, the first of two fights between those two boxers. The bout was held at the City Auditorium in Atlanta, Georgia and Ali won by third-round technical knockout. Over the next three years, Perez oversaw 18 more fights, all in New York and most at the Madison Square Garden or the theater on the Garden's property, the Madison Square Garden's Felt Forum. Many of these bouts included world champions and top rated boxers such as Angel Espada, Harold Weston, Enrique Pinder, Davey Vasquez, the Bobby Cassidy-Tom Bethea match, the Jerry Quarry versus Randy Neumann fight. Jorge Ahumada against Ray Anderson and Vito Antuofermo facing Danny McAloon. None of these were generally considered to be very important fights, however. =Ali- Frazier II= Then, on January 28, 1974, Perez came to the international spotlight when he was chosen to referee the Muhammad Ali-Joe Frazier rematch, pitting the two former world Heavyweight champions as they tried to return to the world title, in a match contested for the North American Boxing Federation's Heavyweight title. Frazier had 30 wins and one second-round knockout loss to George Foreman (when he lost the world Heavyweight title) while Ali was 43–2, with 31 knockout wins, having lost to Frazier in their first bout on March 8, 1971 and to Ken Norton; he had avenged the loss to Norton and was now trying to avenge his loss to Frazier; at stake was a fight against Foreman for the world title. Perez made a move that has been somewhat criticized by fans and some sportswriters alike afterward when, after Ali had hurt Frazier with 20 seconds to go in the second round, Perez stepped between the two as he allegedly had heard the bell sound. Ali went on to win by twelve round unanimous decision, but Frazier and his trainer Eddie Futch were critical of Perez, saying that he was unwilling to take points from Ali for holding Frazier during the encounter. =Shavers-Stallins= On November 4, 1974, Perez was the referee for a bout that is widely considered by fans and experts as one of the biggest upsets of boxing of that era as Bob Stallins, a 21 win, 24 losses with only 4 knockout wins trialhorse, beat 46 wins, 3 losses, 45 knockout wins top contender Earnie Shavers, dropping Shavers, considered one of the hardest punching boxers in the sport's history and also considered to have one of the strongest chins ever, in round nine. Perez, who was also one of the three official judges for the bout, scored it 6–4 in rounds for Stallins. This bout was held at the Felt Forum. Eighteen days later, Perez was back as both referee and judge for the main event between Hall of Fame member Emile Griffith and Vito Antuofermo at the Madison Square Garden, which Antuofermo won by ten rounds unanimous decision. Perez voted 6-3-1 for the winner. =Ali-Wepner= Perez's next assignment also became a very prominent fight in boxing history when, on March 24, 1975, Ali defended the world Heavyweight title versus Chuck Wepner. Perez was called in to referee this bout; his second fight refereed outside New York (the first had been Ali-Quarry I). Underdog Wepner became an instant celebrity when, in round nine, he scored a knockdown of Ali. This also became a controversial matter- many have felt that Wepner only dropped Ali because Wepner stepped on Ali's foot as he landed a punch to Ali's heart. Wepner disputes this. Nevertheless, the knockdown and fight allegedly inspired Sylvester Stallone to write and film the first Rocky film. Perez's refereeing that night was, ironically, unsatisfying to the winner Ali, who, according to Perez, complained that Perez let Wepner hit Ali with low blows and called him a \\"dirty dog\\". Ali commented that Perez was \\"not Black and (he's) not White-(he's) Puerto Rican but (he's) trying to be White\\", \\"He is more Black than White, but he's trying to be White\\". Perez hit Ali and ABC Wide World of Sports (which televised the bout in the United States) with a suit asking for 20 million dollars, a federal court resolved the suit in favor of Ali. Perez was the referee for Carlos Monzon's only fight as a professional in the United States, when he stopped Tony Licata in ten rounds to retain the world Middleweight title at the Madison Square Garden, on June 30, 1975. He next took his first trip abroad as a referee, going to Oslo, Norway to officiate the match between Monzon's personal friend, Argentina's Victor Galindez and Norway's Harald Skog for the former's WBA world Light-Heavyweight crown, a bout won by the Argentine by a third-round knockout on March 28, 1976. After referring several other major fights, including one of Yoko Gushiken in Japan and bouts including Alexis Arguello, Wilfred Benitez (versus Bruce Curry), Alfonso Zamora, Wilfredo Gomez and George Foreman, Perez was assigned the World Boxing Council's world Junior Lightweight championship fight between 3 division world champion Arguello (defending his second divisional world title) and future two time world Junior Lightweight champion Rafael Limon of Mexico. Arguello and Limon fought on Sunday, July 8, 1979 at the Felt Forum, Arguello retaining the title by stopping Limon (who contested the stoppage bitterly) in round eleven. Fight at Rahway Perez visited Rahway State Prison in Woodbridge Township, New Jersey, at a time when professional boxing fights were allowed in American prison systems, to oversee the ten round bout between James Scott and Alvaro Lopez, Saturday, December 1 of 1979, a match in which Perez also served as a voting judge. Scott, who was an inmate at the same jail at that time, won a ten-round unanimous decision, Perez scoring the fight 8 rounds to 2. =Cooney versus Norton= On May 11, 1981, Perez was given referee duties for the HBO Boxing televised event between Heavyweights Gerry Cooney and the former WBC world champion, Hall of Fame member Ken Norton. Cooney won the fight by technical knockout 54 seconds into the first round. The fight catapulted Cooney into his showdown with Larry Holmes for the WBC world title and culminated Norton's career. Perez was criticized for not stopping the match earlier, as Norton was motionless in a corner seconds before Perez intervened. Next came the WBA world bantamweight title match between champion Jeff Chandler and fellow Puerto Rican, former world champion Julian Solís of Puerto Rico. This was a rematch and Perez refereed it; on Saturday, July 25, 1981 at the Resorts International in Atlantic City, New Jersey Chandler retained the title stopping Solis in seven rounds. Three weeks later, Perez was in Panama refereeing the WBC world Junior Flyweight title match between world champion Hilario Zapata, a future Hall of Famer also, and future world champion German Torres of Mexico. On August 15, 1981, Zapata outpointed Torres over fifteen rounds. The next major match refereed by Perez pitted an already legendary boxer and (later) Hall of Famer (Arguello) defending his third divisional world title, the WBC Lightweight one, against a future legend, world champion and Hall of Famer himself, Ray Mancini, at Bally's Park Place Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, October 3, 1981. Arguello retained the title with a fourteenth-round knockout in a fight ended by a highlight reel knockout. =Disqualification of Elisha Obed= On November 12, 1981, Perez was involved in two rather large fights, Rocky Lockridge versus Refugio Rojas (won by future world champion Lockridge by ten round majority decision; Perez, also a judge in this fight, scored it for Lockridge 7-2-1) and future world Light Heavyweight champion Bobby Czyz versus former Junior Middleweight world champion Elisha Obed of The Bahamas. The Czyz-Obed bout, a Middleweight contest scheduled for ten rounds, was notable because Perez disqualified Obed in round six for what Perez considered to be excessive holding on the Bahamian's part. Obed tried to attack Perez after the match's end, Perez warning him to stay away from Perez.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQ1opTAmpJI =Referring Salvador Sanchez's last bout= Perez was the referee, on July 21, 1982, of the last bout fought by legendary Mexican boxer Salvador Sanchez when he defended, successfully, his WBC world Featherweight title against a then almost unknown, but now also legendary, challenger Azumah Nelson from Ghana. Sanchez retained the crown by a fifteenth-round technical knockout, then died tragically 21 days later, killed in a car crash near Mexico City. Both Sanchez and Nelson later became members of the International Boxing Hall of Fame as well. =Luis Resto versus Billy Collins, Jr.= Almost a year after Sanchez-Nelson, Perez was involved in another very controversial fight, although this time no one could blame him for the controversy that arose after the match; On June 16, 1983, in the program headlined by the Davey Moore versus Roberto Durán WBA world Junior Middleweight championship bout, Perez got to referee and judge a Junior Middleweight encounter between 14 wins, no losses or ties Billy Collins, Jr. and 20 wins, 8 losses and 2 ties Luis Resto. Resto pounded Collins for ten rounds and was initially given a ten rounds unanimous decision win, but Billy Collins, Sr. noticed that padding had been removed from Resto's gloves when Collins, Sr. touched one of them right after the bout. Upon finding evidence of this by the New York State Athletic Commission, the fight's result was overturned and changed to a \\"no-contest\\" instead. Collins, Jr. sustained career ending injuries to his eyes and died on March 6, 1984 when he crashed his car in Antioch, Tennessee, while Resto and Resto's trainer Panama Lewis were tried in court during 1986 and sentenced to three and six years in jail, respectively, Resto being released in 1989 and Lewis in 1990. Then, on September 10, 1983, Perez was the referee for the Larry Holmes versus Scott Frank WBC world Heavyweight title bout held at the Harrah's Marina Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City. Holmes beat Frank by fifth-round technical knockout. Five days later, Perez was back at the Madison Square Garden as referee of the Ray Mancini-Orlando Romero WBA world Lightweight championship match, which Mancini won by ninth-round knockout when Perez counted the Peruvian Romero out as Romero sat on the canvas after a punch. =Coetzee vs. Dokes= On September 23, 1983, Perez participated in another historic fight, when Michael Dokes defended his WBA world Heavyweight title against Gerrie Coetzee. South African Coetzee beat Dokes by tenth-round knockout at the Richfield Coliseum in Richfield, Ohio, becoming not only the first White world Heavyweight champion since Ingemar Johansson 23 years before, but also the first world Heavyweight champion from Africa in boxing history. =Hagler's knockdown= Perez refereed the March 30, 1984 world Middleweight title fight between champion Marvelous Marvin Hagler and his Argentine challenger, Juan \\"The Hammer\\" Roldan at the Riviera Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada. In a situation somewhat similar to the Ali-Wepner fight he'd refereed years before, Hagler went down seconds after the first round had begun as he slipped followed by a right hand from Roldan that grazed the champion's head. Perez called it a knockdown, the only official knockdown suffered by Hagler in his professional boxing career. In round three, Roldan became entangled against the ropes after a Hagler combination and fell; Perez also ruled that a knockdown. Hagler eventually retained the title by a tenth-round technical knockout. Jamaica's first world championship Perez was the referee on October 19, 1984 for the match fought for the vacant WBA's world Junior Middleweight title which had been vacated by Durán, between Ireland's Sean Mannion and Jamaica's Mike McCallum. This bout marked the first time that two women (Carol Castellano and Carol Polis) acted as judges in a professional boxing match and, after McCallum's 15 round unanimous decision victory, the first time a Jamaican boxer won a professional boxing world's championship. =Julio Cesar Chavez= Tony Perez was given the responsibility of officiating the WBC world Junior Lightweight title bout between champion Julio César Chávez of Mexico and challenger Refugio Rojas as part of the Hector Camacho vs. Edwin Rosario fight's undercard, June 13, 1986 at the Madison Square Garden. Chavez, Sr. dropped Rojas to the floor several times before winning by seventh-round technical knockout. Only six weeks later, Perez again shared a ring with the Mexican legend when Chavez defended his world title against former and future world champion Rocky Lockridge, whom the future Hall of Famer from Mexico beat by a somewhat controversial, twelve round majority decision with Perez as referee on Sunday, August 3, 1986 at the Stade Louis II in Fontvieille, Monaco. =Bassa-McCauley= On Saturday, March 26, 1988, Perez refereed the Fidel Bassa-Dave McAuley rematch for Colombian Bassa's WBA world Flyweight championship in a battle that had generated much interest both in Ireland and internationally. Bassa retained the title by a twelve-round unanimous decision at the Kings Hall in Belfast, Northern Ireland. =Evander Holyfield= Perez refereed Evander Holyfield's second bout in the Heavyweight division. Holyfield, already a world champion in the Cruiserweight division, battled former WBC world Heavyweight champion Pinklon Thomas on December 9, 1988 at the Convention Hall in Atlantic City, knocking him out in seven rounds. Holyfield would later become world Heavyweight champion multiple times. =Damiani-Du Plooy= The World Boxing Organization asked Perez to referee their inaugural WBO world heavyweight championship bout on May 6, 1989 at the Stadio Nicola de Simone in Syracuse, Sicily, Italy between South Africa's Johnny du Plooy and Italy's Francesco Damiani. Damiani won the contest by third-round knockout (despite this, most outside the WBO continued recognizing Mike Tyson as \\"undisputed\\" champion in the division) Perez was the Italy fight's referee. =Camacho-Paz= On Saturday, February 3, 1990, Perez refereed the match between WBO world Junior Welterweight champion Hector Camacho Sr. and his challenger, former and future world champion Vinny Paz (then known as Vinny Pazienza) at the Convention Hall in Atlantic City. Camacho Sr. retained the title by twelve rounds unanimous decision. =Jung Koo Chang-Muangchai Kittikasem= Perez flew to South Korea during 1991 to referee the May 18 bout between WBC World Flyweight champion Muangchai Kittikasem of Thailand, 14 wins and a loss to Michael Carbajal coming in with ten wins by knockout, and the 38 wins, 3 losses, 17 wins by knockouts challenger, former WBC world Junior Flyweight champion and future Hall of Famer Jung Koo Chang of South Korea at the Olympic Gymnastic Gymnasium in Seoul. This match is also considered a classic; Kittikasem had been floored three times (twice in round five and once in round eleven) and was on the verge of being defeated by knockout when he connected with a left hook and right hand that sent Chang down with about one minute left for the fight to finish in round 12, badly hurting Chang. The South Korean fighter rose but was downed again immediately afterwards, with Perez halting the fight with 24 seconds to go, giving the defending world champion a come from behind victory. This was Chang's last boxing fight and his only knockout loss as a professional boxer. =Mercer KO5 Morrison= Perez was the referee of one of the first major boxing pay per view and WBO fights, when then WBO world Heavyweight champion Ray Mercer beat Rocky V star and future WBO world Heavyweight champion Tommy Morrison, to retain the championship, with a fifth- round technical knockout that is often considered one of the best finishes in boxing history, October 18, 1991 at the Convention Hall in Atlantic City. =McClellan-Bell= Perez's first fight in Puerto Rico took place on Friday, August 6, 1993, at the Ruben Rodriguez Coliseum in Bayamon as part of a program headed by a Felix Trinidad fight. In it, WBC world Middleweight champion Gerald McClellan, 28 wins, 2 losses with 26 knockouts, dispatched challenger Jay Bell in only 20 seconds of the first round, scoring the fastest knockout in a Middleweight world championship fight in professional boxing's history. This match was broadcast on Showtime Championship Boxing. =Oliver McCall versus Frank Bruno= Oliver McCall, WBC world Heavyweight champion with 26 wins and 5 losses, with 18 knockouts, went to London, England to defend his title versus British Frank Bruno, 39 wins and 4 losses with 38 knockouts, at Wembley Stadium on September 2, 1995, with Perez as referee. Bruno won the title by beating McCall by twelve rounds unanimous decision in what turned out to be the last win of his career. =Camacho Sr.-Durán I= Tony Perez was then called on to referee the pay per view match between two aging but legendary former world champions, Hector Camacho Sr. and Roberto Durán, which was held on June 22, 1996 at the Mark Etess Arena in Atlantic City. Camacho Sr. won the contest between the two future Hall of Famers by a 12 rounds unanimous decision a victory which Camacho Sr. would repeat several years later in a rematch. =Roy Jones Jr. controversy= Perez was again involved in a controversial match when Roy Jones Jr., the WBC's world Light Heavyweight champion and, at 34 wins, no defeats or ties, with 29 wins by knockout widely considered either the best or second best fighter in the world at that era, took on challenger Montell Griffin, undefeated and untied in 26 fights with 18 wins by knockout on March 21, 1997 at the Taj Majal Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City. The champion dropped the challenger in round nine but then threw a punch to his head as Griffin sat on one knee. Perez disqualified Jones Jr., giving Griffin the world championship and Jones Jr. his first loss as a professional. Perez explained that he \\"was counting because if he could have continued, (Perez would have taken) one or two points away from Jones\\". This fight was also broadcast on television by HBO Boxing. Later years as referee Perez continued to referee for seven more years after the Griffin- Jones Jr. I fight, including many world championship fights taking place in the United States, Mexico, Thailand, Germany and other places. The last match he refereed was one between Panamanian Darmell Castillo, a 10 win, 8 losses and 2 ties with 6 knockout wins boxer versus Bryant Brannon, a 21 wins, 2 losses with 14 knockout wins contender, at the Sovereign Bank Arena in Trenton, New Jersey on October 21, 2005. Brannon won by six rounds majority decision in what was also Brannon's final fight as a professional boxer. Retirement Perez has appeared in a number of boxing related documentaries, most notably Assault in the Ring about the Collins-Resto bout. He makes occasional public appearances at boxing related events.

William Morris opened it in 1998 to house nearly 200 vintage motorcycles and related memorabilia. The original museum was an outgrowth of his business at nearby Bill's Custom Cycles. The collection has since expanded with an eclectic selection of vintage items. History William Morris worked for a Harley-Davidson dealer before opening Bill's Custom Cycles in 1970, off Interstate 80 on the outskirts of Bloomsburg. The shop focused on parts for the growing market in Harley-Davidson custom motorcycles. He bought up the entire stock of dealerships going out of business during Harley-Davidson's slump and expanded into mail orders, saving the collectible bikes and parts. Morris' first collectible bike, a single- cylinder Harley from 1928, was purchased for about $20. After the brand's resurgence in the mid-1980s, Morris profited from selling new old stock. The initial collection was on display at Bill's Custom Cycles, accumulating enough Harley-Davidson signage that the company's legal department demanded Morris remove them; space concerns and this dispute stimulated the idea of a separate museum, which opened with one room in 1998. Morris, Judi Laubach and friends purchased four 19th-century barns from the Bloomsburg area and reassembled them inside a metal prefabricated building on the hill behind the shop. Baltzer J. Pisak of Hazleton, the first dealer Morris bought out in 1970, restored many of the bikes and created the first displays. Business connections in Europe encouraged Morris to expand his collection with items from there. With the addition of \\"Billville\\", an indoor street lined with replica storefronts, the museum covers over . Collection alt=Indoor pedestrian street with almost lifestyle storefronts, flanked by motorbikes. The collection of nearly 200 antique motorcycles is notable for old bikes such as a 1909 Peugeot and 1913 Harley-Davidson Silent Grey Fellow, as well as unusual specimens such as a World War II Kettenkrad, 1961 Moto Guzzi motorcycle dump truck and a Harley-Davidson snowmobile. The displays incorporate motorcycle and military memorabilia. However, Bike Barn has been called \\"as much a chronicle of iconic Americana as it is a motorcycle museum\\", and \\"a tremendous display of bikes, collectibles, and other stuff that just caught their fancy\\". Among others Billville features a complete barbershop and shoe shop purchased from their proprietors and a replica bar, fire station and tobacco shop. Miscellaneous collections include 1939 World's Fair and Elvis Presley memorabilia as well as toys, cameras and telephones.

Also called Auld Castlehill, it lies on the outskirts of the burgh of Inverness, between Culcabock, Drakies, and Culloden and it may be the hill where Macbeth's castle once was. The lands were thought to have been granted to the Cuthbert family by King Kenneth in the 950s, however the first known charter erecting Castlehill into a barony is from King James III on 23 July 1478. This charter was granted to William Cuthbert, grandson of George Cuthbert \\"who distinguished himself at the Battle of Harlaw\\". The barony was held by the Cuthbert family until 1802. When Lewis Cuthbert died in that year, the lands were sold to a London company and the title of baron became \\"dormant\\".

The necropolis consists of over 30 tombs in various styles, which were arbitrarily divided into four groups, Group A through Group D, by archaeologists. Due to construction work, Group D was excavated in 1980. It was found to contain two keyhole-shaped tumuli and one square tumulus from the Kofun period and three graves from the earlier Yayoi period, along with a large amount of Yayoi period pottery shards. The two keyhole-shaped tumuli has lengths of 33 meters and 34 meters respectively. The 34-meter tomb was excavated, and found to contain a stone-lined burial chamber in which gravel and clay are alternately stacked in holes of 8.1m from east to west and 5.6m from north to south. It contained stone sarcophagus with a wooden coffin. It was built in the first half of the 4th century, based on excavated earthenware, making it one of the oldest in the prefecture. Inside were numerous grave goods, including a bronze hammer, iron swords, and Chinese-made bronze mirror with a triangular rim and design of mythical animals, along with pottery from the early Kofun period. The third tomb, a 12-meter trapezoidal-shaped tomb, and with the burial part in gravel, contained a sword and spear, and an iron casket, Earthenware (Haji ware) pottery from the second half of the third century was excavated.

In contrast, Lorner Goldner of the anarcho-communist news website Libcom was far more critical, writing, \\"without exactly setting out to do so, Max Elbaum in his book Revolution In The Air, has managed to demonstrate the existence of progress in human history, namely in the decline and disappearance of the grotesque Stalinist- Maoist- ‘Third World Marxist” and Marxist-Leninist groups and ideologies he presents, under the rubric New Communist Movement, as the creations of pretty much the “best and the brightest” coming out of the American 1960’s.\\" NCM veteran and former Theoretical Review contributor Paul Saba, gave the book a mixed review in Viewpoint Magazine.

She was born in 1905 in Vienna, Austria to Max and Olga Bloch. Her father possessed a Juris Doctor, and Bloch decided to follow in his footsteps upon graduating from a humanistic girls’ high school. She obtained her Juris Doctor in 1930 and began a seven-year training requirement at a juvenile court in order to become an attorney. It was during her training that Bloch discovered an interest in criminal law, and she thereby became a prosecutor. Her time as a lawyer was short-lived, however, as she was forbidden to practice law due to her Jewish ancestry beginning on July 15, 1938. It was also in 1938 that she married architect Oskar Bern. They subsequently immigrated to New York City where Bern-Zernik found a translating job for a newspaper. In 1941, Bern-Zernik later earned her M.A. in Latin and German from the Teachers College, Columbia University. However, due to being Jewish and not being an American citizen, she found few prospects as an educator. From 1944-1946, Bern-Zernik became a naturalized citizen and began working various jobs with the Office of War Information, American Broadcasting Service in Europe, and as a director for a Displaced Person Camp in Germany. By 1948, she returned to New York and served as a librarian at the United Nations. During her time a librarian, she was a liaison between the United Nations and New York Public Library. It was also during the same year that she married her second husband Herbert Zernik. In 1954, she earned an M.A. in library science at Columbia University. Throughout her life, Bern-Zernik was an advocate for Austrian causes, and she even earned a Golden Medallion for her contributions to Austria. Bern-Zernik passed away on December 31, 1996 in Queens, New York.
