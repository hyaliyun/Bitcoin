A Mangler is a pattern that performs multiple operations over a series of data, similar to the MapReduce function inside of Bigtable and Amazon's Dynamo. Typically, a mangler is fed a series of Maps from which it performs its internal operations and passes its internal state/data to an external Filter. A typical usage of the Mangler Pattern is during internal search operations. When parsing a query from an end-user, the system will try to strip out a series of un-needed tokens, reassembling the original query into a more usable, functional query.

This is the first full-length colour movie made in entire Pakistan. This was the fourth film by Zahir Raihan (1935-1972) who later went on to direct more films in Urdu and Bengali during the 1960s. Zahir Raihan became one of the most important filmmakers of East Pakistan, which later became Bangladesh in 1971. Although Sangam was an Urdu film, but most of the cast, playback artistes and crew were from the Bengali-speaking Eastern province. Sangam was the first ever colour film in Pakistan, and it was released on Eid-ul-Azha Day, 23 April 1964. The film was produced and directed by Zahir Raihan for Sunny Circle Presentations. Plot The film was about college students visiting remote village of Bengal for an excursion but they get caught in an island. Music It is not known which archive has the master print of the film. But some of the songs are now available in Youtube. Among the playback singers were Bashir Ahmed, Ferdausi Begum, Mohd. Abdul Jabbar, Akhter Shaad and Mahboubur Rahman. Khan Ataur Rahman composed the musical scores. The leading cast of the film was Rosy and Haroon, but more than its cinematic novelty, the film was liked for its musical score. The most popular song of Sangam was Hazar Saal Jo Buddha Mil Gaya, based on a famous English number and very intelligently adopted by Khan Ataur Rehman. It was sung by Bashir Ahmad and chorus voices. Surfing on the waves of the accordion, and the guitar strings, the song took the local industry by storm and the film got a good reception. Kitni Suhani Rangeen Khwab Dikha Kar, by Ferdausi Begum was a sad melody with the tanpura and violin in attendance. Chali Re Chali had that jovial touch of the Bengali winds. Neela Gagan Hai was a Hemant Kumar type duet, a fabulous number with the banjo and accordion, sung delightfully by Ferdausi Begum and Abdul Jabbar. The Neeli Neeli Aankhon Mein was another lively duet. The director Zahir Raihan himself was deeply involved with Bangladesh's war of independence, and had made a documentary Stop Genocide during his wartime exile in Calcutta in 1971. But his life ended abruptly before he could embark on a film project in his independent homeland. He was killed during an army ambush to liberate an enemy-held suburb of Dhaka in January 1972, just about a month after Bangladesh's independence.

Dylan and the Band first recorded the song in 1967, but it was not released until 1975 on The Basement Tapes album. In 1968, the Band recorded it for their debut album Music from Big Pink. Initial recordings The song was first recorded in rehearsal sessions at the Band's upstate New York residence, Big Pink, in 1967, with Dylan on lead vocal and the Band backing him. These sessions were not officially released until the 1975 double-album The Basement Tapes, although they were widely bootlegged in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The first official release of the song was as the first track on the Band's debut, 1968 album Music from Big Pink, with Manuel on vocal. According to Levon Helm, \\"Richard sang one of the best performances of his life.\\"Levon Helm & Stephen Davies. This Wheel's on Fire. In a song review for AllMusic, Bill Janovitz compared the two versions: \\"The Dylan version is a gentle folk-soul reading; he and the Band are still feeling their way through the phrasing and the arrangement. By the time the Band recorded it, they had slowed it down to a passionate, gospel-informed, New Orleans- style lament.\\" Lyrics Andy Gill likens the song to King Lear's soliloquy on the blasted heath in Shakespeare's tragedy: \\"Wracked with bitterness and regret, its narrator reflects upon promises broken and truths ignored, on how greed has poisoned the well of best intentions, and how even daughters can deny their father's wishes.\\" He suggests that Dylan is linking the anguish of Lear‚Äôs soliloquy to the divisions in American society apparent in 1967, as the Vietnam War escalated: \\"In its narrowest and most contemporaneous interpretation, the song could be the first to register the pain of betrayal felt by many of America‚Äôs Vietnam war veterans... In a wider interpretation [it] harks back to what anti-war protesters and critics of American materialism in general felt was a more fundamental betrayal of the American Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights.\\" A strong Biblical theme runs through the song, according to Sid Griffin, who also notes that \\"life is brief\\" is a recurrent message in the Old Testament books Psalms and Isaiah. As a father, Dylan realizes now that \\"no broken heart hurts more than the broken heart of a distraught parent.\\" Griffin calls the four minutes of this song \\"as representative of community, ageless truths and the unbreakable bonds of family as anything in The Band's canon‚Äîor anyone else's canon.\\" Greil Marcus suggests that the \\"famous beginning\\"‚Äî\\"We carried you/In our arms/On Independence Day\\"‚Äîevokes a naming ceremony not just for a child but also for a whole nation. He writes that \\"in Dylan's singing‚Äîan ache from deep in the chest, a voice thick with care in the first recording of the song‚Äîthe song is from the start a sermon and an elegy, a Kaddish.\\" Citations References  * External links *\\"Tears of Rage\\" at bobdylan.com Category:1967 songs Category:Songs written by Bob Dylan Category:Songs written by Richard Manuel Category:Bob Dylan songs Category:The Band songs Category:Song recordings produced by John Simon (record producer) ","title":"Tears of Rage"},{"id":"13585571","text":"George Frost may refer to: *George Frost (New Hampshire politician) (1720‚Äì1796), American seaman, jurist, and statesman *George Frost (cricketer) (1848‚Äì1913), English cricketer *George Frost (landscape painter) (1754‚Äì1821), English landscape painter *George Frost (Australian politician) (1869‚Äì1942), Australian politician *George Albert Frost (1843‚Äì1907), American artist *George L.

Career On July 18, 1882, pitcher Tony Mullane of the Louisville Eclipse, normally a right-handed pitcher, began to pitch left-handed whenever a Baltimore Oriole left-handed hitter would come to bat. This strategy appeared to work until the ninth inning when left-handed hitting Charlie Householder hit a home run to win the game for the Orioles. For the season, Householder signed with and was playing for the Merrits of Camden, New Jersey, when Charlie Byrne of fellow league team, the Brooklyn Grays bought his contract, along with other Merrits Sam Kimber, Bill Greenwood, Frank Fennelly, and Jack Corcoran. He finished out the year and transitioned with the team over to the American Association, where they would be known as the Atlantics. On October 4, 1884, Householder collected two of the Atlantics four hits off Tony Mullane, this time of the Toledo Blue Stockings, a single and a double. The game went 10 innings and was called because of darkness, ending in a 0-0 tie, with Atlantic pitcher Sam Kimber recording the first extra-inning no-hitter.

The next day, the grandmother wakes up early to hide her cat, Pitty Sing, in a basket on the floor in the back of the car. She is worried that the cat will die while they are gone. Bailey finds his mother sitting in the car, dressed in her best clothes and an ostentatious hat; if she should die in an accident along the road, she wants people to see her corpse and know she was refined and \\"a lady.\\" The grandmother talks constantly during the trip, trying to engage her two grandchildren in games and telling them jokes and a story, about which June Star makes disdainful comments. She recalls her youth in the Old South, reminiscing about her courtships and how much better everything was in her time, when children were respectful and people \\"did right then.\\" When the family stops at an old diner outside of (the fictitious town of) Timothy, Georgia, for lunch, she talks to the owner, Red Sammy, about The Misfit. He and the grandmother agree that things were much better in the past and that the world at present is degenerate; she concurs with Sammy's remark that \\"a good man is hard to find.\\" After the family returns to the road, the grandmother begins telling the children a story about a mysterious house nearby with a secret panel, a house she remembers from her childhood. This catches the children's attention and they want to visit the house, so they harass their father until he reluctantly agrees to allow them just one side trip. As he drives them down a remote dirt road, the grandmother suddenly realizes that the house she was thinking of was actually in Tennessee, not Georgia. That realization makes her involuntarily kick her feet which frightens the cat, causing him to spring from his hidden basket onto Bailey's shoulder. Bailey then loses control of the car and it flips over, ending up in a ditch below the road, near Toomsboro. Only the children's mother is injured; the children are frantic with excitement, and the grandmother's main concern is dealing with Bailey's anger. Shaking in the ditch, the family waits for help. When the grandmother notices a black hearse coming down the road, she flags it down until it stops. Three men come out and begin to talk to her. All three have guns. The grandmother says that she recognizes the leader, the quiet man in glasses, as The Misfit. He immediately confirms this, saying it would have been better for them all if she had not recognized him, and Bailey curses his mother. The Misfit's men take Bailey and John Wesley into the woods on a pretense and two pistol shots ring out. The Misfit claims that he has no memory of the crime for which he was imprisoned; when he was informed by doctors that he had killed his father, he claimed that his father died in a flu epidemic. The men then return to take the children's mother, the baby, and June Star to the woods for the same purpose as Bailey and the boy. The grandmother begins pleading for her own life. When The Misfit talks to her about Jesus, he expresses his doubts about Jesus raising Lazarus from the dead. As he speaks, The Misfit becomes agitated and angry. He snarls into the grandmother's face and claims that life has \\"no pleasure but meanness.\\" In her growing confusion, the grandmother thinks that The Misfit is going to cry, so she reaches out and touches his shoulder tenderly, saying \\"Why you're one of my babies. You're one of my own children!\\" His reaction is to jump away \\"as if a snake had bitten him,\\" and he kills her with three shots through the heart. When the family has all been murdered, The Misfit takes a moment to clean his glasses and pick up Pitty Sing; he states that the grandmother would have been a good woman if there \\"had been somebody there to shoot her every minute of her life.\\" The story ends with The Misfit chastising one of his sidekicks, Bobby Lee, for making a comment \\"some fun!\\" \\"Shut up, Bobby Lee,\\" he retorts. \\"It's no real pleasure in life.\\" Characters ;Bailey: Atlanta resident with a wife and three children and his mother. He crashes their car on a family trip to Florida when he gives in to his mother's and children's wishes to visit an old plantation. Although not much is revealed about Bailey's character, he struggles with being the head of the family. He has little to no control over his disobedient children, giving into their demands to stop and see the house with the secret panel. He also seems to put up with a lot of his mother's drama because in the beginning of the story it is noted that she seizes any chance to let him know what is on her mind. He is the first to be murdered in the family. ;Bailey's wife:Quiet woman described as having a face that was \\"as broad and innocent as a cabbage.\\" She is not identified by name, only as \\"the children's mother.\\" Much like her husband, not much is revealed about the mother. She does not have control over her kids and lets them do what they please. This causes her to receive criticism from her mother-in-law. However, she appears to be a strong woman because after the car crash she dislocates her shoulder and barely makes a fuss about it. She becomes very distraught about the deaths of her son and husband before she follows the men into the woods to be killed. ;Grandmother: Bailey's mother, who lives with the family. She is not identified by name. The grandmother is a very closed-minded individual. She has her own set ideals on morality and virtue which she believes everyone should uphold. Her values can be seen when she always dresses up to appear like a ‚Äúlady‚Äù or when she criticises her grandchildren for not being respectful. She thinks of herself as superior because she's able to maintain her precious standards, however, she is actually extremely hypocritical. By becoming so wrapped up in her old fashioned mentality of others‚Äô character, she becomes a selfish and judgemental woman. Her hypocritical ways can be seen when she becomes absorbed in pleading for her life and never once asking the Misfit to spare her family's lives. When she is trying to sympathize with the Misfit, she has a realization finally understanding her weaknesses. Right after this moment, she is murdered like the rest of her family. ;John Wesley, June Star:Bailey's children, aged 8 and 7, respectively. These two children are very misbehaved. During the car ride, they are very rowdy and disrespectful to their grandmother. John Wesley says he dislikes his home state. June Star says she \\"wouldn‚Äôt live in a broken down place like this for a million bucks\\" about the diner they stop in. When they decide they want to go to the house with the secret panel, they scream until they get what want. Even towards the end of her life, June Star is rude. She says that the man that leads her into the woods to be killed looks like a pig. ;The Baby: Male child of Bailey and his wife. Not identified by name. ;Red Sammy Butts: Restaurant operator who agrees with the Grandmother that the world is in a state of decline. ;Red Sammy's Wife: Waitress in Red Sammy's restaurant. She observes that not a single person in the world is trustworthy. ;The Misfit: A misguided, escaped prisoner who stumbles upon Bailey's family after they have crashed. He orders his fellow escapees to systematically murder the entire family and he personally shoots the grandmother multiple times after their conversation. In the last moments of the grandmother's life, the Misfit discusses his personal philosophies. First, he believes that he is innocent of the unknown crime he committed that put him in jail. This is why he calls himself the Misfit because he says his conviction was a mistake. The Misfit also has no spiritual beliefs, therefore he relies on himself to be his moral compass. When the grandmother tries to appeal to his mercy with religion he immediately dismisses her. He questions the meaning of life and has thoroughly examined his experiences to make sense of his current position. ;Hiram, Bobby Lee: Prisoners who escaped with The Misfit. ;Edgar Atkins Teagarden: Man referred to in a story told by Bailey's mother. He would have been a good man to marry, she says, because he owned Coca-Cola stock and died rich. ;Pitty Sing: Male pet cat of the Grandmother. Bailey flings him against a tree after the accident. He is last seen rubbing against The Misfit's leg. (\\"Pitty Sing\\" is a character in the Gilbert and Sullivan operetta, The Mikado.) ;Gray Monkey: Pet of Red Sammy Butts. The monkey is chained to a chinaberry tree. ;The Negro child: A child that the family sees, at the beginning of their journey, standing in the door of a shack, while the grandmother is stating that, in her time, children used to be more respectful. The child does not have any pants on: the grandmother refers to him as a \\"pickaninny\\", and she adds that he would make the subject of a painting. She explains that \\"niggers\\" in the country do not have the things that they have. The scene seems to indicate the grandmother's indifference to other people's lives and needs. The child needs essential clothing, while on the contrary the grandmother wears her best clothes in order to appear a \\"lady\\", i.e. to signal her superior social status. In the final scene, the Misfit will need a shirt, and he will take Bailey's. Interpretation There are varying opinions of \\"A Good Man Is Hard to Find\\". Most of this discrepancy centers on the grandmother's act of touching The Misfit. The dominant opinion of the story is that the grandmother's final act was one of grace and charity, which implies that \\"A Good Man Is Hard to Find\\" was written to show a transformation in the grandmother as the story progresses. She originally perceives herself as a righteous woman, making her able to \\"justify\\" all of her actions. She bribes the granddaughter and encourages the defiance of the children against the father; in the end, she even begins to deny the miracles of Jesus as she states \\"Maybe He didn't raise the dead\\".Bonney, William. \\"The Moral Structure of Flannery O'Connor's a Good Man Is ..\\" Studies in Short Fiction, vol. 27, no. 3, 1990, pp. 347. Regardless of this, she still is trying to share the message of the Gospel with the Misfit. The reader sees how she, in the final moments of her life, tries to save one more soul after the Misfit has already killed her family, by calling out the Misfit's name. A second opinion on the issue is that the grandmother's final act was not an act of charity and that she is yet again trying to save herself from being murdered. Some say that Flannery O'Connor uses the excuse as the grandmother's final \\"moment of grace\\" to save the story from the bloodshed and violence. Frederick Asals argues that \\"one can easily pass over her [O'Connor's] hope that the grandmother's final gesture to The Misfit might have begun a process which would 'turn him into the prophet he was meant to become'; that, as she firmly says, is another story, and it would be a reckless piety indeed which would see it even suggested by the one we have\\".Asals, Frederick. \\"The Limits of Explanation.\\" Critical Essays on Flannery O'Connor. Melvin J. Friedman and Beverly Lyon Clark, eds. Boston: G.K. Hall, 1985, p. 52. It is also pointed out that by the time the grandmother touches the Misfit, proclaiming he is her son, he is wearing Bailey's shirt. Other opinions include that it is contradictory of her character or that she was simply again trying to save herself and that her selfishness was never overcome throughout the story. Not every interpretation hinges on a moral judgment of the grandmother, though. For example, Alex Link considers how, until the family encounters the Misfit, the South is mainly something to ignore, forget, package in a movie or a monument, or remember with distorted nostalgia, such that the Misfit comes to stand for the persistence of what cannot be bought, sold, or wholly understood, such as death, grace, and \\"the South.\\"\\"Means, Meaning and Mediated Space in 'A Good Man is Hard to Find.'\\" The Southern Quarterly. 44.4 (2007): 125-38. Theme of grace O'Connor utilized the dark and morose in her writing to reveal beauty and grace. In the story, violence reveals divine grace. Divine grace, or God's unmerited favor, is a concept fundamental to humanity's salvation in Christian theology. Christians believe the imperfect can be reborn spiritually, i.e. people can be saved by grace through Jesus Christ. While the two seem to be different, the grandmother and the Misfit both are the same at their core: sinners in need of grace. Abbie Harris says in her short article, \\"The Misfit is blatantly sinful and enraged at the concept of God's grace, and the Grandma masks her sinfulness with respectability and chooses to treat God as something that she can accept or ignore depending on her situation\\".Harris, Abbie C. \\"Jesus Thrown Everything Off Balance\\": Grace and Redemption in Flannery O'Connor's 'A Good Man is Hard to Find',\\" Papers & Publications: Interdisciplinary Journal of Undergraduate Research, vol. 3, Article 5. The sins the grandmother commits throughout the story depict her as a severely flawed individual in need of saving. Only at her death does she realize her faults. After he shoots her, the Misfit claims \\"she would have been a good woman, if it had been somebody there to shoot her every minute of her life.\\" O'Connor includes this line because she is not trying to convey the message that if someone has a traumatic experience, their life will be changed. She instead conveys a message of the sinful nature of humans; these experiences people may go through do not stick. The grandmother's life would have to be threatened every day for her to become a good person. Adaptations A film adaptation of the short story \\"A Good Man Is Hard to Find\\", entitled Black Hearts Bleed Red, was made in 1992 by New York filmmaker Jeri Cain Rossi. The film stars noted New York artist Joe Coleman, but according to most reviewers the film does not depict the story or its characters well. The American folk musician Sufjan Stevens adapted the story into a song going by the same title. It appears on his 2004 album Seven Swans. The song is written in the first- person from the point of view of The Misfit. In May 2017, Deadline Hollywood reported that director John McNaughton would make a feature film adaptation of the story starring Michael Rooker, from a screenplay by Benedict Fitzgerald.

These arteries meet the myometrial-endometrial junction and lead to straight and endometrial arteries. The endometrium receives blood from endometrial arteries which are also called spiral arteries. Endometrial arteries proliferate rapidly and react to different hormones released. These hormones are progesterone and estrogen released by the ovaries and produced by the endocrine system. The endometrial arteries not only supply blood to the endometrium but are also important during pregnancy. They are the initial site of transportation of blood from the mother to the baby.  Location of endometrial arteries  The uterus, part of the female reproductive system, is composed of the myometrium and the endometrium. The myometrium is made of smooth tissue and the endometrium lines the uterus. The endometrium is important in pregnancy because it is involved in the development of the placenta and it is where the fertilized egg implants itself during pregnancy. In the endometrium there are endometrial arteries which are also known as spiral arteries. The arcuate arteries located in the myometrium, branch out into the myometrium and then spread throughout endometrium forming endometrial arteries which is how the endometrium obtains blood. Endometrial arteries are coiled and is why they are also called spiral arteries. The spiral arteries are coiled towards the upper part of the endometrium and straight towards the base of the endometrium.  Function of endometrial arteries during pregnancy  In the endometrium there are straight and serial arteries. Straight arteries specifically branch to the base of the endometrium therefore supplying blood to the base of the endometrium. Spiral arteries supply blood to the rest of the endometrium. They grow rapidly, covering much of the space of the endometrium and end up coiled. When hormones levels are low, the endometrial arteries react by becoming narrow. Endometrial arteries supply blood to the endometrium but are also beneficial during pregnancy. When a female is pregnant a placenta develops. The baby receives blood, nutrients and oxygen via the umbilical cord which is attached to the placenta. Between the placenta and the myometrium are intervillous spaces where the endometrial arteries supply blood to. The placenta has villous trees which allow for blood to circulate and then be transported to the baby via the placenta.  Other functions of endometrial arteries  Endometrial arteries are divided into the common ones and the arteriovenous anastomosis. The common ones are arteries that are homologous to the arteries of the rest of the body and they enrich the endometrium of the uterus. The joining of endometrial arteries and veins of the endometrium is known as arteriovenous. Endometrial arteries are also involved in the menstrual cycle. When the egg implants onto the endometrium and is not fertilized the endometrial arteries become narrow and the endometrium begins to disintegrate. This is when the endometrium sheds and results in menstruation.

He was married to Bessie Graham Hobson (1923‚Äì2000) and they had three children, Elizabeth, Margaret and Hugo Black III. After the younger Black graduated from high school, he went to the University of Alabama until he was drafted into the Army and stayed stateside during the World War II era. He then went back to the University of Alabama and in 1946 graduated with an A.B. in English. Then in 1949, he received an LL.B. from Yale University, where he was a member of the Board of Editors of the Yale Law Journal and president of Yale Law School Student Association and graduated second in his class. He was admitted to practice law in the states of Alabama and Florida, as well as several Federal District Court of Appeals, and the Supreme Court of the United States. After graduating from Yale Law, he returned to Birmingham where he began a labor law practice. In 1952, Black considered following in his father's footsteps by entering politics. \\"I definitely had politics in mind,\\" he wrote in his book about his father. That year, his father told him to come to Washington, D.C. and warned him that if he was elected to Congress he would be under constant political attack at home because the high court would soon have some important decisions dealing with school segregation, according to Justice Black biographer Roger Newman. As a result, the younger Black decided not to run and stayed in Alabama. After the 1954 unanimous landmark U.S. Supreme Court Brown vs. Board of Education decision that desegregated public schools and being the son of the Supreme Court Justice Black, the younger Black received threats from people who said they would burn crosses in his yard, his young son was taunted at school, and by the early 1960s ‚Äî saying he had had enough ‚Äî the younger Black moved his young family to what is now Pinecrest Florida.

Theodora Kimball Hubbard (1887-1935) was the first librarian of the Harvard School of Landscape Architecture, and a contemporary of and collaborator with many significant figures in landscape architecture in expanding the body of knowledge in that subject area.  Early life and education  Hubbard was born on February 26, 1887 in West Newton, Massachusetts, Hubbard was the older sister of the noted architectural historian Sidney Fiske Kimball. She graduated from the Girls‚Äô Latin School in Boston in 1904 and entered Simmons College later that year, graduating in 1908. In 1917 she received a master‚Äôs degree in Library Science from Simmons College, with a minor and thesis in English landscape gardening.  Career  = Early Career = Hubbard worked briefly as an editorial writer for The New England Historical and Genealogical Register, where she compiled a subject index to its first sixty volumes. In 1910 she worked for a year as an assistant in the Boston Public Library‚Äôs Art Department. Following her master's degree, she headed the library of the U.S. Bureau of Industrial Housing and Transportation in Washington, D.C. for two years. By the 1920s she was teaching at both the Cambridge School of Architecture and Landscape Architecture and in the Landscape Architecture Department at Harvard Graduate School of Design, where she taught English. = Later Career = Theodora Kimball Hubbard worked as the Librarian of the School Landscape Architecture at Harvard from 1911-1924. She was the first Landscape Architecture Librarian at Harvard University, creating a ‚Äúnew‚Äù library by consolidating collections, held in disparate locations, in Harvard‚Äôs Robinson Hall in October 1911. Hubbard's relationship with her brother propelled her into her ultimate career classifying the literature of landscape architecture and city planning. Sidney \\"Fiske\\" Kimball, who was enrolled in the School of Architecture at Harvard, was awarded a Sheldon Fellowship for travel to Europe in 1911 and passed his assistantship in the library to Kimball Hubbard during his absence. Prior to this role, Kimball Hubbard had already been immersed in writing on the growing profession of landscape architecture, and Charles Eliot greatly influenced Kimball‚Äôs understanding of the profession. In addition to cataloguing, Hubbard was involved in research for James Sturgis Pray, Chairman of the Landscape Architecture Department at Harvard University. By helping them with their research, Kimball received an education in landscape architecture. In her role as librarian, she brought a keen sense of professionalism to her work, and until 1918 when she hired her assistant Katherine McNamara, appears to have been the only Harvard design librarian with professional library training. Kimball cultivated the library into a specialized institution, developing it as ‚Äúa clearing-house‚Äù of information and fielding research and information requests from practitioners around the world. Kimball also pioneered organizational and housing systems for visual and graphic media such as lantern slides, photographs, plans, maps, and postcards. The techniques employed at Harvard Graduate School of Design library were based on those used in private offices, particularly the Olmsted firm. During her tenure as librarian, she more than doubled the number of books and pamphlets in the Harvard collection. In 1918 Hubbard became an associate member of the American Society of Landscape Architects. In 1919, Hubbard became the first woman accepted as a member to the American City Planning Institute. That same year she developed the first Library of Congress Classification for landscape architecture under the subclass (NAB). She developed a separate classification scheme for city planning under the subclass (NAC). She was assisted in this endeavor by her husband Henry Vincent Hubbard (1875-1945), a Harvard professor, and the founding editor of Landscape Architecture Magazine. Renowned landscape architect, Frederick Law Olmsted, the designer of a network of parks known as the \\"Emerald Necklace\\" in Boston, Central Park in New York, and idyllic greenspaces across the United States is given special acknowledgment in the preface of the published classification scheme, for having contributed many constructive suggestions. The Library of Congress originally assigned a place for landscape architecture as a sub-classification to architecture (NA) by the addition of the letter (B). The authors thought that this placement most precisely acknowledged the artistic component of landscape architecture, whereas placing it in subclass (S), as it is today, would suggest that it is simply another form of agriculture. Books acquired in this subject area since 1978 are now classed in (SB). She left Harvard in 1924, the year she married Henry Vincent Hubbard, but continued to serve the library in an advisory capacity. She served on President Herbert Hoover's advisory Committee on Zoning in Washington, D.C. as an expert on zoning, and also a member of the research committee for the President's Conference on Home Building and Home Ownership. = Writings = One of her most important works: \\"Municipal Accomplishment in City Planning\\" a bibliography of all of the works on urbanism in the United States was published in Europe and the United States to great acclaim. She is credited with writing over 100 editorials, articles, and reviews in addition to preparing detailed bibliographies and reports on the fields of landscape and city planning. She collaborated with her husband on a basic textbook for landscape architecture, An Introduction to the Study of Landscape Design, which for many years was considered the standard text. Through her work she achieved international recognition. As a librarian and writer she made great contributions to the advancement of the profession of landscape design by organizing the information, critiquing the work, and contributing to the literature, giving the field more substance, status and visibility in academic circles. In addition to published books, Hubbard contributed to such journals as Landscape Architecture (beginning in 1912), House Beautiful, and The Garden Magazine. Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr., commissioned her to edit his father‚Äôs papers for publication in 1920, resulting in Frederick Law Olmsted, landscape architect, 1822-1903. Olmsted and Hubbard worked adjacently at Harvard Graduate School of Design. = Legacy = Kimball‚Äôs library work contributed to landscape architecture education at many schools. She participated for years in the National Landscape Architectural Education Conference, serving on the Subcommittee on English. She also chaired the Committee on Libraries and Collections, given her influence on educational programs through her widely published and regularly updated bibliographies of landscape architecture and city planning publications. The bibliographies she published (often called check-lists and ready reference lists) were used by other universities as a basis for library acquisitions, thus forming part of the foundation upon which other educational programs were built. Hubbard died in November 1935 at the age of 48 in Milton, Massachusetts. In a Landscape Architecture obituary, the Boston Chapter of the ASLA lauded her for service to the profession but declined to cite specifics, noting that there was ‚ÄúIn these few pages no place for a detailed account . . .

It was founded in 1979 by Cynthia Grant, Kim Renders, Mary Vingoe, and Maureen White and was originally a collective. Though it was not the founders' original intention, Nightwood Theatre has become known for producing feminist works. Some of Nightwood's most famous productions include This is For You, Anna (1983) and Good Night Desdemona (Good Morning Juliet) (1988). Nightwood hosts several annual events including FemCab, the Hysteria Festival, and Groundswell Festival which features readings from participants of Nightwood's Write from the Hip playwright development program.  Company history  Nightwood Theatre was launched in 1979 by co-founders Cynthia Grant, Kim Renders, Mary Vingoe and Maureen White. The name Nightwood was inspired by Djuna Barnes‚Äô novel Nightwood. Nightwood was originally intended to be a collective. The company was not originally intended to be a feminist theatre company, but became so by reputation. Nightwood Theatre is part of what Denis Johnston refers to as the \\"third-wave\\" of small theatres in Toronto, encapsulating companies which emerged from the late 1970s to the early 1980s during the end of second-wave feminism.MacArthur, Laura Michelle (2014). \\"Re-viewing Reception: Criticism of Feminist Theatre in Montreal and Toronto, 1976 to Present\\" (PDF). library.utoronto.ca. University of Toronto. p. 185. In the beginning, Nightwood focussed largely on collective creations. Their first production in 1979, The True Story of Ida Johnson, was adapted from the novel by Sharon Riis, and is described as \\"an innovative mixed-media performance\\".Forsyth, Louise. \\"Feminist Theatre.\\" The Oxford Companion to Canadian Theatre. Eds. Eugene Benson and L.W. Connolly. Toronto: Oxford University Press, 1989. P. 206. Grant, who had worked in an editing group at the Women's Press to publish the novel, organized a dramatic reading of The True Story of Ida Johnson in 1977 and there was a workshop production in 1978 featuring Renders, Vingoe and White in addition to Grant herself. The official Nightwood production opened in September 1979.MacArthur, Laura Michelle (2014). \\"Re-viewing Reception: Criticism of Feminist Theatre in Montreal and Toronto, 1976 to Present\\" (PDF). library.utoronto.ca. University of Toronto. p. 85-86. In 1979, Nightwood, along with Buddies in Bad Times, launched the Rhubarb! Festival, originally intended to be a festival of new Canadian works. Nightwood co-presented the 1980, 1981, and 1982 Rhubarb! Festivals until Rhubarb! became a strictly Buddies in Bad Times production in 1983. The founding artistic director of Buddies in Bad Times, Sky Gilbert, found that Nightwood's involvement in Rhubarb! shifted the emphasis of the festival towards conceptual pieces and away from scripts. Nightwood did not develop a formal administrative structure until the 1982, when a small board of directors was formed. It was around this time that the company began consistently referring to, if albeit informally, Cynthia Grant as Nightwood's artistic director. Until this point, Nightwood's founding four members, Grant, Renders, Vingoe, and White, shared leadership roles and frequently interchanged titles and responsibilities. As part of their 1982‚Äì83 season, Nightwood produced the inaugural FemCab, or \\"Five Minute Feminist Cabaret\\" on March 8, 1983 at the Horseshoe Tavern. FemCab was originally produced with Women's Cultural Building, a Toronto-based women's collective who looked to establish a building for women's groups, but, in 1990, it became an annual fundraising event solely for Nightwood. FemCab was briefly suspended for two years from 1995 to 1996. Initially, Grant, Renders, Vingoe, and White tried to avoid Nightwood being labelled \\"women's theatre\\" but were labelled as such by the press. In a 1984 grant application, Mary Vingoe implicitly identified Nightwood Theatre with the feminist movement by stating that Nightwood's 1984‚Äì85 season was designed around and to address the issues raised in Rina Fraticelli's report on the status of women in Canadian theatre. In the same funding application, Vingoe noted that Nightwood's work dealt with \\"the concerns of the women's community\\" among other issues. Nightwood did not, however, explicitly define themselves as feminist theatre or use the words 'feminist' or 'feminism' in official self-description until much later. Work on the collective creation, This is for You, Anna, began in 1983. The play was created by a group of artists, many of whom had worked with Nightwood before, who called themselves the Anna Collective.MacArthur, Laura Michelle (2014). \\"Re-viewing Reception: Criticism of Feminist Theatre in Montreal and Toronto, 1976 to Present\\" (PDF). library.utoronto.ca. University of Toronto. p. 133. The collective consisted of Suzanne Khuri, Ann-Marie MacDonald, Banuta Rubess, Aida Jordao, Patricia Nichol, and Nightwood co-founder Maureen White. This is for You, Anna was inspired by the story of Marianne Bachmeier, a woman who shot the man accused of killing her daughter, and premiered as part of Nightwood's 1985‚Äì86 season. In 1985, Grant and several other founding members left Nightwood. The same year, Vingoe was appointed Nightwood's 'artistic coordinator', fulfilling the same responsibilities of an artistic director. Vingoe said the change in title was to \\"allow[] more 'collective' input on major decisions\\". White took over this position in 1987. In 1988, Kate Lushington is became artistic coordinator and Lynda Hill became associate artistic coordinator. In 1990, Lushington reverted the title of Artistic Coordinator to artistic director. Nightwood Theatre's breakthrough play was Ann-Marie MacDonald's Good Night Desdemona (Good Morning Juliet). The play premiered with Nightwood in 1988 as directed by Banuta Rubess and was remounted in 1990. The play was the winner of Floyd S. Chalmers Canadian Play Award and Governor General's Award, and the production as a whole was nominated for several Dora Mavor Moore awards. In 1991, Diane Roberts was appointed associate artistic director. Then in 1993, Alisa Palmer and Diane Roberts were appointed co-artistic directors. Palmer was appointed the sole incoming artistic director in 1995. Kelly Thornton was appointed artistic director of Nightwood Theatre in 2001, the same year Nightwood launched their play development program, Write from the Hip. In 2002, Nightwood moved their offices from the Theatre Centre to the Toronto's Distilleries district, where they still are today. The next year, Nightwood launched Hysteria: A Festival of Women with Buddies in Bad Times. The Hysteria Festival was intended to be a semi-annual and multi-disciplinary showcase of North American female artists. The 2003 Hysteria Festival was ten days long and featured classes and workshops in addition to performances and staged readings. Nightwood Theatre held the Consent Event in 2017, coinciding with widespread conversations around the #MeToo movement following allegations of sexual abuse against Harvey Weinstein. The event featured the premieres of two plays and the Consent Event Symposium, a community conversation and workshop about consent. The plays premiered as part of the Consent Event were Rose Napoli's Lo (or Dear Mr. Wells), which Napoli developed when she was a participant in Write from the Hip, and Ellie Moon's documentary-play, Asking for It. In early 2019, it was announced that Andrea Donaldson would be taking over Thornton's role of artistic director. Donaldson's first programmed season will be 2020‚Äì21, though she officially began transitioning into the new role in March 2019. Nightwood Theatre cancelled their performances of Karen Hines' All the Little Animals I Have Eaten in keeping with Canada's guidelines surrounding the COVID-19 outbreak.  Groundswell Festival  Nightwood Theatre's Groundswell Festival of new works began in the spring of 1986 and was originally timed to coincide with International Women's Day. In 2011, Nightwood Theatre held two Groundswell Festivals, the latter of which was called The New Groundswell Festival. In a brochure published by Nightwood for the 2011 New Groundswell Festival, they wrote that \\"Nightwood has re-envisioned and expanded Groundswell to be A National Festival of Contemporary Women‚Äôs Theatre.\\" Since the second Groundswell of 2011, the festival has operated under the new name. The Groundswell Festival takes up approximately one third of Nightwood Theatre's budget. Many plays which have premiered or been workshopped at Groundswell have gone on to be performed as part of Nightwood Theatre's main season. = Write from the Hip = Write from the Hip or WFTH, as it is sometimes called, is Nightwood's script development program for emerging playwrights and began in 2001. Originally, Write from the Hip culminated with playwrights writing 15-minute plays, but former artistic director Kelly Thornton felt that this format did not encourage the participation of playwrights who were committed to theatre. During these early years, Write from the Hip plays were performed by actors from Nightwood's Emerging Actors Program. In the beginning, Write from the Hip was aimed at playwrights aged 19 to 29, but it is now open to participants of any age who fit Nightwood's description of \\"emerging playwright\\". Write from the Hip pieces are now featured as readings as part of the Groundswell Festival. Andrea Donaldson was Write from the Hip program director from 2014 to 2019. Donna-Michell St. Bernard replaced Donaldson as the Write from the Hip program director for the 2019‚Äì20 season. The position has previously been held by Lisa Codrington and Anna Chatterton.

The second ship to be named Marathon by the Navy, PGM-89, a motor gunboat, was laid down 21 June 1966 by Tacoma Boatbuilding Company, Tacoma, Washington; reclassified PG 89 on 28 March 1967; launched 22 April 1967; sponsored by Mrs. Robert W. Copeland; and commissioned 11 May 1968, Lt. L. W. Waterman in command.  A specially- designed littoral combat ship  Designed for shallow water coastal operations, Marathon was built for speed and maneuverability. Constructed almost entirely of aluminum and fiberglass, the ship's light weight and gas turbine engines made the patrol gunboat well suited for counterinsurgency and coastal blockade operations. Given the guerilla tactics in the Vietnam War, as well as the danger to larger ships posed by small missile boats, the Asheville-class patrol gunboats were seen as a relatively cheap \\"littoral combat ship.\\"  Vietnam War operations  After commissioning, Marathon operated independently in Puget Sound for several weeks prior to proceeding to San Diego, California, for further operations and training. Following shakedown operations and individual type training, Marathon prepared for Operation Market Time coastal surveillance operations off South Vietnam. On 28 August, Rear Admiral Elmo R. Zumwalt, (prospective Commander, Naval Forces, Vietnam), rode the ship during a patrol problem to gain insight into the gunboat's capabilities. In November, the gunboat entered Long Beach Naval Shipyard for a short post-shakedown availability, a period lengthened by labor and material problems to 5 March 1969. Later that month, Marathon was visited by Secretary of the Navy John H. Chafee. Less than a month later on 15 April, Marathon suffered an engine casualty and more delays as yard workers had trouble welding the gunboats' aluminum deck plates. After repairs were completed in May, the ship finally went to sea for a group exercise in June 1969, where she practiced convoy defense tactics during Exercise \\"Bell Call.\\" She was also visited by Rear Admiral Dybdal, for a tour and evaluation of PG- type ships for the Ethiopian Navy. The gunboat remained at San Diego, until October when she entered Long Beach Naval Shipyard for her first major overhaul. With repairs and modifications complete in late November, began a long series of evaluations and inspections in preparation for a Vietnam deployment. = A new home port in Guam = Following a tactical exercise in January 1970, and coastal interdiction training in March, Marathon departed San Diego on 2 June for her new home port at Guam in the Marianas Islands. After a quick refueling stop at Pearl Harbor, the gunboat arrived at Apra Harbor, Guam on 25 June. A week later, Marathon sailed for South Vietnam and, after a refueling stop at Subic Bay, Philippines on 8 July, she began Market Time duties out of Cam Ranh Bay on the 11th. = Dangerous river patrols = One of Marathon's first tasks was to escort battle damaged from the mouth of the Bo De River back to Cam Ranh Bay on 15 July. The rocket-propelled grenade and bullet scars in Canon's hull were sober reminders of the dangers the gunboats faced in littoral waters. After receiving a camouflage paint scheme, Marathon spent the next nine weeks conducted uneventful river operations before conducting a few coastal surveillance patrols in October. Relieved by other patrol gunboats, Marathon, and their base ship sailed to Guam, via Subic Bay, arriving there on 18 November. = Operation Market Time patrols = Following a restricted availability in Guam, Marathon returned to South Vietnam in late April 1971, beginning Market Time patrols on the 27th. This monotonous cruising was interrupted in late June by a port visit to Bangkok, Thailand, 28 June to 1 July, before the gunboat returned to Cam Ranh Bay to resume patrols. Marathon fired her guns only once, shelling An Thoi Island on 6 August with unknown results, before arriving home to Guam on 14 September. Once there, Marathon began her second major overhaul, which finished up on 8 December. In a change of pace, the gunboat conducted a short security patrol of the Caroline Islands in mid-December. Marathon returned to South Vietnam on 10 March 1972 and operated out of Vung Tau conducting maritime patrols. These operations were again uneventful and the gunboat received a well-deserved week-long visit to Singapore in late July. After a few more weeks on patrol, the gunboat returned home, arriving in Guam on 30 August. She spent the remainder of the year conducting type training and providing submarine torpedo target services. = Visiting local areas in the Far East = In January 1973, Marathon and Gallup conducted a joint week-long patrol in the Caroline Islands before resuming type training out of Guam. Local operations continued until early March, when the gunboat sailed to Subic Bay for coastal patrol operations in the Philippines. On 30 April, Marathon moved on to Hong Kong for a week-long port visit. After a short return trip to Subic Bay, the gunboat sailed north to Taiwan for a visit and demonstration cruises. Marathon then returned to Guam, arriving there on 5 June to commence another overhaul. With yard work finished in September, the gunboat resumed local operations, including two more patrols in the Caroline Islands. Underway 13 February 1974, Marathon and other gunboats sailed to the Philippines and conducted a simulated missile boat attack on the battle group off Subic Bay on the 19th. Unlike the other two gunboats, Marathon avoided the defensive carrier air assets and successfully \\"launched\\" missile attacks against the carrier and one escort. Four days later, the gunboat sortied from Subic Bay for another exercise but a turbine compressor failure took her out of the exercise. Local repairs kept Marathon in port until March, when the gunboat prepared for Exercise Multiplex 1-74, a combined gunboat-aircraft attack exercise on a carrier battle group. While at sea on 18 April, however, Marathon suffered a fuel leak and fire in the turbine spaces that burned into the crew spaces, forcing the ship to shut down her engines. Towed into port the following day, the gunboat was drydocked in AFDL-10 for repairs.  Return to the States  Following post-repair sea trials, Marathon and the other gunboats at Guam returned to the United States, arriving in Chicago, Illinois, on 12 November after a long, circuitous transit via Pearl Harbor, San Diego, the Panama Canal, Norfolk, Virginia, the St. Lawrence Seaway and the Great Lakes. Once there, the gunboats helped train reservists as part of Coastal River Division 21. The gunboats also supported Navy recruiting efforts and made numerous port visits to small ports on Lake Michigan, including Traverse City, Michigan, and Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In company with and , Marathon got underway on 1 June 1976 for her new home port back in Little Creek, Virginia. The gunboats sailed out through the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River, visiting Quebec en route, before arriving in Little Creek via Newport, Rhode Island, on 25 June. Following a series of local operations, and one short visit to New York City, the ship received notification in November of her upcoming inactivation.  Decommissioning  Marathon was decommissioned at Portsmouth, Virginia, on 31 January 1977 and was struck from the navy list that same day. The ship was demilitarized and transferred to the Massachusetts Maritime Academy on 18 April 1977.

History President Ronald Reagan issued a presidential proclamation on January 13, 1984, designating Sunday, January 22, 1984 as National Sanctity of Human Life Day, noting that it was the 11th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, in which the Supreme Court issued a ruling that guaranteed women access to abortion. President Reagan was a strong anti-abortion advocate who said that in Roe v. Wade the Supreme Court \\"struck down our laws protecting the lives of unborn children\\". Reagan issued the proclamation annually thereafter, designating Sanctity of Human Life Day to be the closest Sunday to the original January 22 date.see: 1989 and 2006 when January 22 fell on a 4th Sunday as in the original 1984 date of the proclamation. Though it is usually the case, National Sanctity of Human Life Day is not simply \\"the 3rd Sunday in January\\" His successor, George H. W. Bush, continued the annual proclamation throughout his presidency. Bush's successor, Bill Clinton, discontinued the practice throughout his eight years in office, but Bush's son and Clinton's successor, George W. Bush, resumed the proclamation and did so every year of his presidency. At the end of the first year of his presidency, Donald Trump issued a proclamation declaring Monday, January 22, 2018 to be National Sanctity of Human Life Day; however, the next year, his proclamation set it again to a Sunday, that being January 20, 2019. The day is traditionally marked as a holy day by the Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod as Sanctity of Human Life Sunday. According to the Proper CalendarProper Calendar for the Dioceses of the United States of America of the Catholic Church in the United States, as requested by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) and approved by the Holy See, 22 January (or the 23rd if the 22nd is a Sunday) is observed as the \\"Day of Prayer for the Legal Protection of Unborn Children\\". Response The proclamation of National Sanctity of Human Life Day has been heralded by National Right to Life as \\"a wonderful statement of what the pro-life movement is really all about\\" while reproductive rights groups like NARAL and Planned Parenthood have denounced it, saying it signals a desire to roll back the rights of women.\\"Bush Declares...\\" In an amicus brief filed by the National Lawyers Association in the case of Elk Grove Unified School District v.

It is one of the lesser known among its type in Central Europe. It dates to the late Neolithic, probably just after 3000 BC.Raetzel-Fabian 2000, 130 It belongs to the gallery graves of the Wartberg culture, but is unique among them because of its rich ceramic assemblage.  Discovery and excavation  The tomb was discovered accidentally in 1931 by the farmer Jakob Elmsh√§user who encountered an obstacle when ploughing a field. It turned out to be a large rectangular sandstone block, sitting just below the surface. Professor Gero von Merhart, specialist for prehistoric monuments in the area, was contacted. As a result, the site was excavated by students from the University of Marburg under the direction of Otto Uenze.Huth 1989; Jockenh√∂vel 1990, 435  Tomb architecture  The sunken rectangular chamber measured c. 5 x 2.2m (internal measurements), narrowing somewhat towards the back. Although most of its orthostaths were missing, it was still possible to reconstruct its rectangular plan from the foundation trenches.Uenze 1954, 28-29 The individual slabs reached a length of 60 cm to 1m, were 40 cm wide and about 80 cm high. Their weight varied between 800 and 1,000 kg. The tomb consisted of a large main chamber and a small open antechamber. They were separated by a large sandstone slab with a circular hole, similar to the one at Z√ºschen. This so-called Seelenloch (German for \\"soul hole\\") had a diameter of 30‚Äì35 cm. It is suggested that such a small opening should not have served the passage of dead bodies but may represent a symbolic gateway between the worlds of the living and the dead during cultic rituals or offering ceremonies that took place in the anteroom. Only a quarter of the Lohra Seelenloch stone survived. The bottom of the sunken main chamber was covered with a clay floor of 3‚Äì5 cm thickness. The tomb probably had a wooden roof. The presence of many stones in and around the chamber probably indicates that it was originally covered by an artificial mound or tumulus.Uenze 1954, 28  Human remains  In contrast to the finds from the well-known tombs at Z√ºschen or Altendorf, the dead at Lohra had been cremated. There were about 20 individuals, including adult men and women as well as children.Uenze 1954, 29 Pottery They were accompanied by a large amount of pottery vessels, which is a unique feature among the northern Hessian (Wartberg culture) gallery graves. 20 vessels that had been placed on the chamber floor and later covered in human ashes were almost fully preserved. Handled cups or mugs with plastic decorations, similar to finds from Z√ºschen, were especially common, as were bowls, some of them with feet and handles. The finds also include a large double conical bowl with strap handle and a pattern of alternating standing and hanging semicircles. Other double conical vessels survived only in fragments. One vessel has metope-like ornaments resembling the French Chass√©en culture.Uenze 1954, 30-37 It has been pointed out that the pottery from Lohra is very similar to that from the Wartberg culture settlement on the Hasenberg near Fritzlar.Schwellnu√ü 1979, 67-70 Other finds Apart from ceramics, there was a very carefully made serpentine axe with an oval shaft hole, a retouched slate blade and a small piece of sheet bronze of unknown function.Uenze 1954, 30 The metal may not belong to the period of the tomb's original use.Schrickel 1966, 298 The characteristic animal remains known from other Wartberg tombs were absent.  Disappearance of the entrance stone  Most of the finds have been in storage at the Hessian State Museum (Hessisches Landesmuseum) at Kassel since 1931. This does not include the entrance stone, which was moved to the farmyard of the field's owner, where it stayed for 36 years. In 1967, it was decided to place that stone as a monument outside Lohra town hall. Unfortunately, it turned out that it had recently been built into the foundations of a building on the farm.Huth 1989 See also *Z√ºschen (megalithic tomb) *Altendorf (megalithic tomb) *Niedertiefenbach (megalithic tomb) *Wartberg culture  Bibliography * Karl Huth: Die Gemeinde Lohra und ihre 10 Ortsteile im Wandel der Jahrhunderte. 1989 * Albrecht Jockenh√∂vel: Lohra - Megalithgrab, in: Fritz-Rudolf Herrmann & Albrecht Jockenh√∂vel (eds.): Die Vorgeschichte Hessens. 1990, p. 435-436. * Dirk Raetzel-Fabian: Die ersten Bauernkulturen: Jungsteinzeit in Nordhessen.

Alexander fell victim to the Iran-sponsored coup led by his own son, Constantine I.  Early reign and political alliances  Alexander was a son of King Levan of Kakheti by his first wife Tinatin Gurieli. Upon Levan's death in 1574, Alexander secured his succession in a power struggle with his half- brothers ‚Äì El-Mirza and Kaikhosro ‚Äì and their party. He was aided by his kinsman and western neighbor, Daud Khan of Kartli, who sent auxiliary troops under the princes Bardzim Amilakhvari and Elizbar of the Ksani, and helped Alexander crush the opponents at the Battle of Torgi. Alexander II continued a traditional policy of his predecessors aimed at keeping peace with the neighbors of Kakheti. This, for the time being, secured the economic stability and prosperity in the kingdom. However, he faced a difficult task of maneuvering between the Ottomans and Safavid Iran as both empires vied for the hegemony in the Caucasus. Although Alexander was initially a vassal, at least nominally, of the Safavids, he repudiated his allegiance to the Shah of Iran and accepted the Ottoman suzerainty when the latter empire gained the upper hand in 1578. The move did not prevent, however, Kakheti from being attacked by the mountainous subjects of the Shamkhal of Tarki who was apparently instigated by the Ottoman agents. Alexander decided to resume his father's efforts to establish alliance with the Tsardom of Russia. After exchanging ambassadors in 1586‚Äì1587, Alexander received the protection of Tsar Feodor I of Russia, signing the Book of Pledge in 1589. Russian troops were sent against the shamkhal in a brief campaign of 1592. Little else came of the Russian promises, leading to a series of complaints by Alexander to the tsar's ambassadors.Suny, Ronald Grigor (1994), The Making of the Georgian Nation: 2nd edition, pp. 48-50. Indiana University Press, Between 1596 and 1597, envoys of Alexander II, Simon I of Kartli, and Manuchehr of Samtshke arrived at the Safavid court, including slave boys and girls, who were entertained by Prince Constantine (also known as Kunstandil), the son of Alexander II himself, who had been brought up at the Safavid court.Willem Floor,Edmund Herzig. Iran and the World in the Safavid Age I.B.Tauris, 30 jan. 2015. p 481  Downfall  Royal charter of Alexander II. In October 1601, Alexander's son, David, revolted from the royal authority and seized the crown, forcing his father to retire to a monastery. David died a year later, on October 2, 1602, and Alexander was able to resume the throne. Meanwhile, Iran started to regain what had earlier been lost to the Ottomans. The energetic Shah Abbas I laid a siege to the Ottoman-held fortress of Erivan in November 1603 and summoned Alexander to his headquarters. After months of hesitation, Alexander acceded, massacred the Ottoman garrison in Tiflis, and arrived at Erivan in April 1604. Early in 1605, Shah Abbas sent him back with orders to raid Shirvan. He was accompanied by his son, Constantine, who had been raised at the Safavid court as a convert to Islam. Back in Kakheti, Alexander found a new Russian embassy requesting his support in a projected campaign against the shamkhal. The Russian envoys had already been favorably received by Alexander's son, George, who ran the kingdom in his father's absence. Dissatisfied by this maneuver, Constantine demanded the loyal execution of the shah's orders. On March 12, 1605, Alexander summoned a council at Zagem. Within hours, Constantine led his Qizilbash entourage into a bloody coup against his own father; Alexander, George and several of their nobles were massacred. Constantine was made by the shah king of Kakheti, and the Safavid suzerainty was, for the time being, reasserted in the kingdom. –í–∞—Ö—É—à—Ç–∏ –ë–∞–≥—Ä–∞—Ç–∏–æ–Ω–∏ (Vakhushti Bagrationi) (1745). .

Introduced in Northern Lights =Lyra Belacqua= Lyra Belacqua, later known as Lyra Silvertongue, is the central character of His Dark Materials and a key character in The Book of Dust. Together with her d√¶mon Pantalaimon, she is introduced as a baby in La Belle Sauvage, where she is being protected from the Magisterium. She is protected by the nuns of the Priory of Saint Rosamund, and then brought up by the scholars of Jordan College. As she leaves Jordan in the company of her mother, Mrs Coulter, the Master of the college gives her an alethiometer, which allows her to find answers on any subject. Searching for a kidnapped friend of hers, she ends up travelling to the far north of her world, and then across the multiverse, where she plays a part in a cosmic war between forces led by an angel named The Authority and her father, Lord Asriel. Lyra is prophesied by the witches to play the part of Eve, bringing about a second fall; this is accomplished when she reaches maturity and starts attracting Dust, halting its loss from the multiverse. By the events of Lyra's Oxford, Lyra is living in Jordan college and studying at St Sophie's. Pantalaimon has settled into the form of a pine marten. In The Secret Commonwealth, Lyra is 20 and an undergraduate. In the unabridged audiobooks, Lyra is voiced by Joanna Wyatt, and in the BBC Radio dramatisation she is voiced by Lulu Popplewell.Pullman, Philip, Northern Lights, 2003, BBC Audio, 9781408409411 In the 2003 stage production at the Royal National Theatre, the character was played by Anna Maxwell Martin. In the 2007 movie adaption, she is played by Dakota Blue Richards who also voiced her in the video game adaption of the film. Dafne Keen plays the character in the His Dark Materials TV series. =Lord Asriel= Lord Asriel is a member of the English aristocracy and Lyra's father. His d√¶mon Stelmaria is a snow leopard. Asriel had an affair with Marisa Coulter, a married woman, leading to Lyra's birth. Asriel kills Mrs Coulter's husband after he finds out, but is spared imprisonment because of laws allowing self-defence. As a part of his punishment, he is barred from seeing Lyra, but he takes an interest in her raising, delivering her to Jordan College and visiting her. Lyra grows up believing Asriel to be her uncle rather than her father. Asriel is described as being \\"a tall man with powerful shoulders, a fierce dark face, and eyes that seem to flash and glitter with savage laughter\\". Possessed of enormous determination and willpower, he is fierce in nature and commands great respect in both the political and academic spheres, being a military leader and a fellow of Jordan College. In Northern Lights, he is able to build a bridge to another world, where he assembles an army to oppose The Authority, an angel that claims to be God. Asriel dies alongside Mrs Coulter killing Metatron, the Authority's regent. In the unabridged audiobooks, Lord Asriel is voiced by Sean Barrett; on stage in the UK's Royal National Theatre production, he was played by Timothy Dalton; in the BBC Radio dramatisation, he is voiced by Terence Stamp. In the film adaptation, he is played by Daniel Craig while Chris Edgerly voices him in the video game adaption. James McAvoy plays the character in the His Dark Materials TV series. =Marisa Coulter= Marisa Coulter (n√©e Van Zee; ordinarily called Mrs Coulter in the books) is Lyra's mother and a powerful figure in the Magisterium, the organisation of the Church. She founds the League of St Alexander in La Belle Sauvage, and later heads the General Oblation Board, referred to colloquially as the Gobblers. Her d√¶mon is a golden-coloured monkey, who, in the books, is never named and only speaks once (he is called Ozymandias in the BBC Radio adaptations and the character Malcolm Polstead notes in La Belle Sauvage that, \\"if that monkey had a name it might be 'Malice'\\"). She is cruel and merciless at times, stopping at nothing to get what she wants. She is deceptive, full of grace and beauty, and uses these qualities to get her way. However, when she finds her daughter in peril at Bolvangar, she experiences a sudden realisation of intense love and a wish to care for Lyra which outweighs her previous loyalty to the Church, and thereafter she goes to great lengths in the effort to shield her from the events around her. She dies alongside Asriel while killing Metatron, the regent of the Authority. In the unabridged audiobooks, Mrs Coulter is voiced by Alison Dowling; in the BBC Radio dramatisation she is voiced by Emma Fielding; in the film, The Golden Compass, she is played by Nicole Kidman while Erin Matthews voices her in the video game adaption. For the Royal National Theatre production in 2003, Patricia Hodge created the role. Ruth Wilson plays the character in the His Dark Materials (TV series) (2019). =Iorek Byrnison= Iorek Byrnison is an armoured bear and companion of Lyra's. Armoured bears, known as panserbj√∏rne in Danish, are a race of polar bear-like creatures with human-level intelligence and opposable thumbs; they have no d√¶mons and consider their armour, which is made of meteoric iron, to be their soul. Before the events of His Dark Materials, Iorek meets and befriends Lee Scoresby. Iorek was king of the armoured bears in Svalbard, but was exiled after killing another bear in a fight. Normally, when a bear realises that they are outmatched, they will surrender, but Iorek's opponent had been drugged by Iofur Raknison, second in line for the throne, to prevent this. Following his exile, the humans of an Arctic port town deceived him by giving him spirits and stealing his armour while he was intoxicated. Lyra finds him in Northern Lights working in a scrap yard for food and board and proceeds to use her alethiometer to help him retrieve his armour. Following this, he helps Lyra, naming her Silvertongue. When Lyra ends up imprisoned by Iofur Raknison, she arranges a fight between Iorek and Iofur for the throne, which Iorek wins. After the opening of a gate to Citt√†gazze changes the climate of Svalbard, Iorek is forced to take his fellow armoured bears on a voyage down to the Himalayas, where he meets Will Parry. When Will breaks the Subtle Knife, Iorek is able to repair it without the aid of specialist equipment. He and a regiment of his subjects fight on Lord Asriel's side in the battle on the plains; as part of this he takes Lyra and Will to find their lost d√¶mons. At the end of The Amber Spyglass, it is revealed that he returns to Svalbard and reigns as king of the armoured bears. In the film, he is voiced by Ian McKellen while Fred Tatasciore voices him in the video game adaption. In the unabridged audiobooks, Iorek is voiced by Sean Barrett. Joe Tandberg voices and motion-captures Iorek in the TV series. =John Faa= John Faa, sometimes known as Lord Faa, is the Lord of the western Gyptians. Despite his advancing age, he is a brave warrior, respected by all his followers, open to advice, and considerate of all. He is a good friend of the elderly Farder Coram. His d√¶mon is a black crow. When the Oblation Board starts kidnapping children, he leads 170 of his men to save them. He is wounded in an ambush but carries out his mission successfully, retrieving the children Lyra helped rescue, and taking them back to England. Faa re-appears briefly at the conclusion of The Amber Spyglass when he and other Gyptians are briefly drawn into the world of the Mulefa to bring Lyra home before the worlds separate once again. In the film The Golden Compass, Faa is played by Jim Carter while Michael Gough voices him in the video game adaption. Lucian Msamati plays the character in the His Dark Materials TV series. =Ma Costa= Ma Costa is a Gyptian woman whose son, Billy Costa, is abducted by the \\"Gobblers\\" early in Northern Lights. A year before the beginning of the book, Lyra and her friends had \\"hijacked\\" her family's boat and sailed it to Abingdon, the next town downriver. In spite of this, Ma Costa rescues Lyra and takes her to John Faa. When Lyra is hiding with the Gyptians, she discovers that Ma Costa had in fact nursed her, when she was a baby. Ma Costa's d√¶mon is a hawk. Anne-Marie Duff plays the character in the His Dark Materials TV series. =Bernie Johansen= A minor character whose d√¶mon has the rare quality of being the same gender as himself. Half-gyptian, he was tasked with watching Lyra for Lord Faa while working as a pastry chef at Jordan College.Northern Lights, chapter 7 =Serafina Pekkala= Serafina Pekkala is a clan queen of the witches of Lake Enara who, along with her snow goose d√¶mon Kaisa, is closely associated with Lyra and her journey. She assists Lyra in her fight at Bolvangar and throughout His Dark Materials, travelling into other worlds and attempting to heal Will Parry. At the end of The Amber Spyglass, she names Will's d√¶mon, and encourages Will and Lyra's d√¶mons to return to them. Serafina claims to be three hundred years old or more. Before the events of La Belle Sauvage, Farder Coram saved her life from an attack by another witch's d√¶mon, and they became lovers. They had a son who died from a disease from the East. Pullman claimed on the BBC World Service programme World Book Club in December 2005, that Serafina's name came from a Finnish telephone directory. In context, Pullman was teasing the audience, however the claim has since been repeated on several fan-sites. Later in the same programme and in a speech made in Dundee, he said that the name came from a list of politicians living in Copenhagen. In the film The Golden Compass, Serafina Pekkala is played by Eva Green while Hellena Taylor voices her in the video game adaptation. In the 2003 Royal National Theatre production of His Dark Materials she is played by Niamh Cusack. In the TV series His Dark Materials, Ruta Gedmintas plays the character. =Lee Scoresby= Lee Scoresby is a skilled \\"a√´ronaut\\" balloonist from the country of Texas with an arctic hare d√¶mon named Hester. Lee meets Iorek Byrnison in Once Upon a Time in the North when he is twenty-four. In Northern Lights, Lee is hired by John Faa and the Gyptians to aid in their mission to save the kidnapped children; following the rescue, he helps transport Lyra to Svalbard. In The Subtle Knife, he pledges to help the witches in their fight against the Magisterium and sets out to find Stanislaus Grumman. Grumman, also known as Jopari or John Parry, is a shaman and travels with Lee into the world of Citt√†gazze. Lee gives his life fighting Magisterium soldiers, allowing John Parry to reach his goal. Following their deaths, Lee and Parry fight Spectres after they are released from the land of the dead. After this task is done, Lee allows himself to dissolve so that his atoms can be mixed with the atoms of Hester and his other loved ones. Phillip Pullman said of Scoresby's name that \\"the Lee part comes from the actor Lee Van Cleef ... because I thought my Lee would look like him, and the Scoresby comes from William Scoresby, who was a real Arctic explorer.\\"http://books.scholastic.com/teachers/authorsandbooks/authorstudies/authorhome.jsp?authorID=78&displayName;=Interview%20Transcript American actor Sam Elliott plays Lee Scoresby in the film The Golden Compass while James Horan voices him in the video game adaption. Lin-Manuel Miranda plays the character in the His Dark Materials TV series. =Iofur Raknison= Iofur Raknison is an armoured bear who wishes to be equal to a human. After usurping Iorek Byrnison as king of the armoured bears, he commands his subjects to build a palace of stone and wear ornamentation of gold and silver, which had been traditionally despised. He had dealings with the Magisterium and Mrs Coulter, allowing them access to his kingdom in exchange for the ability to be baptised as a Christian. Lyra is able to trick him into fighting Iorek Byrnison by convincing him that she is herself a d√¶mon and that she could become his d√¶mon. Traditionally, armoured bears are unable to be tricked but in his behaving like a human, he loses this ability; Iorek is able to exploit this by feigning injury. After Iofur's defeat, Iorek is proclaimed the king, and his first command is that the bears discard their pseudo-human trinkets and tear down Iofur's palace. In the 2007 film adaptation, The Golden Compass, the character is renamed Ragnar Sturlusson, to prevent confusion with Iorek Byrnison, Chris Weitz says \\" The only difference is that he is called Ragnar Sturlusson and not Iofur Raknison. Why? I didn't want anyone to confuse his name with Iorek's.\\" and is voiced by Ian McShane while JB Blanc voices him the video game adaption. In the TV series, Iofur is motion-captured by Joi Johannsson and voiced by Peter Serafinowicz. =Roger Parslow= Roger Parslow, a young kitchen boy and youngest of the Parslow family ‚Äì who had long been employed as masons for Jordan College ‚Äì was the best friend of Lyra Belacqua during her early life in Jordan College. Roger's d√¶mon, named Salcilia, often appears as a terrier. Roger is kidnapped by the General Oblation Board (\\"the Gobblers\\") and taken to their experimental centre in Bolvangar. When Lyra arrives there he assists her in helping the children escape and goes on with her to see Lord Asriel in Svalbard. Asriel uses Roger to create a bridge between worlds by severing him from Salcilia, killing him in the process of channelling the energy from the severing to create the bridge. In The Amber Spyglass, he appears trapped in the Land of the Dead; Lyra is eventually able to free him and all the other dead souls to merge with the Dust in the living worlds. In the TV series, Roger is portrayed by Lewin Lloyd. =Lord Boreal= Lord Carlo Boreal, or Sir Charles Latrom, CBE as he is known as in Will Parry's world, serves as a minor character in Northern Lights, but is a main antagonist in The Subtle Knife. He is an old Englishman, appearing to be in his sixties. He normally wears pale suits and is described as smelling sweetly. Lord Boreal is first seen in Lyra Belacqua's world at the cocktail party of Mrs Coulter. He interacts shortly with Lyra. He is also mentioned just before Lord Asriel crosses the bridge to Citt√†gazze in Northern Lights as being a lover of Mrs Coulter's. In The Subtle Knife, Boreal watches Lyra exploring a museum in Will's world and approaches her, appearing to be a kindly old man whose only interest in her is to discuss the skulls. Lyra remembers seeing him previously, but is unsure of his identity. Later, when Lyra is being chased by the men who are after John Parry's notes, Latrom is in a chauffeured limousine and offers her a lift, at which time he steals her alethiometer. Lord Boreal tells them that they must get the Subtle Knife for him from Citt√†gazze and he will return to them the alethiometer. After retrieving the knife, Lyra and Will steal back the alethiometer by cutting through from Citt√†gazze into Will's world directly within Boreal's study. During this, they overhear a conversation between Coulter and Boreal, where he explains how he was able to set up a life in that world. Later, Boreal attempts to learn what Mary Malone knows about Dust by offering to continue funding her and her colleague's work. In a tent in the mountains of Citt√†gazze, Mrs Coulter drugs Boreal's drink in order to make him tell her about the Subtle Knife; he dies shortly thereafter from the poisoned drink. Boreal's name means \\"northern\\" or \\"related to the north\\", as in aurora borealis. His pseudonym, Latrom, is \\"mortal\\" spelled backwards. Ariyon Bakare plays this character, whose role was expanded, in the His Dark Materials TV series. He was assigned to look for John Parry and enlists a contact on Earth to help search for him while spying on his family. =Farder Coram= Coram Van Texel is a gyptian with a large, unusually beautiful, golden-brown cat d√¶mon named Sophonax. His voice is described as \\"rich and musical, with as many tones in it as there were colours in his d√¶mon‚Äôs fur.\\" By Northern Lights, he is known as Farder Coram and is a respected, elderly, adviser to the Gyptian King John Faa. More than fifty years prior to the start of the trilogy, Coram travelled to the north, where he witnessed a witch, Serafina Pekkala, being attacked by another witch's d√¶mon. Farder Coram shot the rogue d√¶mon and rescued Serafina, thereafter they became lovers and had a son, who was killed in his youth by a disease from the east. After the son's death, Serafina Pekkala returned to her people as the clan-queen, and Coram returned to the Gyptians. In La Belle Sauvage, Coram is working for Oakley Street, a secret society opposing the influence of the Church. He obtains information about Mrs Coulter, fights Gerard Bonneville, and warns Malcolm Polstead of the upcoming flood. He accompanies Lyra to Bolvangar to rescue the captured children and guides her in mastering the alethiometer. Coram re-appears briefly at the conclusion of The Amber Spyglass when he and other Gyptians are drawn into the world of the Mulefa to meet Lyra and bring her home before the worlds separate once again. 'Farder' is possibly a dialect variant of 'Father', honouring his role as 'Elder' to the Gyptians. He is played by Tom Courtenay in the film The Golden Compass. In the film The Golden Compass, his d√¶mon is a caracal, an African, lynx-like wildcat. James Cosmo plays the character in the His Dark Materials TV series. =Dame Hannah Relf= Dame Hannah Relf and her marmoset d√¶mon Jesper are scholars at St Sophia's college. In La Belle Sauvage, she is an alethiometrist and a member of Oakley street, a secret society opposing the Magisterium. By the time of Northern Lights, she is the Mistress of St Sophia's college. In The Amber Spyglass, she invites Lyra to study at St Sophia's and learn to read the alethiometer from her. =The Master of Jordan College= The Master of Jordan heads Jordan College, part of Oxford University in Lyra's world. Helped by other Jordan College employees, he is raising the supposedly orphaned Lyra. In La Belle Sauvage, he offers scholastic refuge to Lyra. In Northern Lights, he tries unsuccessfully to poison Lord Asriel, hoping that it will protect Lyra and prevent conflict. In The Amber Spyglass, he offers Lyra a place to live at Jordan, and funding for her education. In the television adaptation, he is played by Clarke Peters. Introduced in The Subtle Knife =Will Parry= Will Parry is the bearer of the Subtle Knife and a point of view protagonist of The Subtle Knife and The Amber Spyglass. He is the son of John Parry, an explorer, and of Elaine Parry, a woman who suffers from mental health problems. Will does not remember his father, a former Royal Marine, who has not been heard of since he vanished on an expedition to the Arctic when Will was an infant. It is later revealed that John Parry has wandered into another world and is unable to find his way back. Will becomes the companion of, and ultimately falls in love with Lyra Belacqua, and also becomes the bearer of the Subtle Knife by winning a fight, in which he loses two fingers on his left hand. At the end of the third book, he must leave Lyra Belacqua and live entirely in his own world, where he is taken care of by Mary Malone and his cat d√¶mon, Kirjava (which means mottled in Finnish). In the unabridged audiobooks, Will was voiced by Steven Webb for The Subtle Knife and by Peter England for The Amber Spyglass. In the TV series, he is portrayed by Amir Wilson. =Dr. Mary Malone= Dr. Mary Malone is a physicist from Will's world investigating dark matter, which is equated with Dust, and is a point of view protagonist in The Subtle Knife and The Amber Spyglass. She is a former nun, and in the witches' prophecy involving Lyra, she plays the part of the serpent to Lyra's Eve. In The Subtle Knife, Lyra meets her and tells her about her world's research into Dust, which Mary equates with dark matter and refers to as Shadows. Lyra demonstrates the use of her alethiometer, and Mary is able to program her dark matter detector to function similarly. The detector instructs her to go through the window into Citt√†gazze, which she does, eventually arriving at the world of the Mulefa. There she builds the titular Amber Spyglass, allowing her to see Dust, and investigates the death of the trees that are essential to the Mulefa's environment. She discovers that the Dust is no longer falling from the sky to pollinate the trees, but is instead flowing sideways. When Lyra arrives, a conversation with Mary begins to inspire in her a sexual awakening, leading to her d√¶mon's shape settling and to her beginning to attract Dust; this action is enough to arrest the loss of Dust and to save the trees, and as such she fulfils the prophecy. At the end of The Amber Spyglass, the witch Serafina Pekkala reveals to Mary both how to see her d√¶mon and also its form - that of an alpine chough. She offers to help Will upon their return to their own world. Mary Malone does not appear in Nicholas Wright's stage adaptation of the novels due to the difficulty of portraying Mulefa onstage. The role of the tempter was given to Serafina Pekkala, who was also the bearer of the spyglass, which had been created by Jopari as a device to view Dust. =John Parry= Colonel John Parry, also known as Dr Stanislaus Grumman and Jopari, is the father of Will Parry and the husband of Elaine Parry. Prior to the start of the trilogy, John Parry had been a famous English explorer and a major in the Royal Marines in Will's world. When Will was a small child, he went on an archaeological exploration of Alaska, hoping to find a portal to a different world. He eventually found it during a blizzard, entering the world of Citt√†gazze, where his two companions were killed by the Spectres. He continued his travels, arriving in the home world of Lyra Belacqua. There he met his d√¶mon Sayan K√∂t√∂r, an Osprey, and assumed the name Stanislaus Grumman. He attended the Berlin Academy, becoming a well-known explorer, and studied Dust. He joined the Yenisei tribe and underwent trepanation of his skull, becoming a shaman of the tribe and taking the name Jopari. He spurned the love of the witch Juta Kamainen because of his continued love for his wife. In The Subtle Knife, Lee Scoresby is sent to find Grumman. He eventually finds him among the Yenisei tribe, although Grumman claims that it was he who called Lee to find him. Lee takes Grumman to Citt√†gazze as Grumman wishes to find the bearer of the √Üsah√¶ttr (\\"God-destroyer\\" in Old Norse). Grumman finds the bearer, Will, on top of a mountain and fights with him after Will attacks him in the darkness. Grumman uses some bloodmoss (a lichen used to stop bleeding) to heal Will's wound, and informs him of the role of the bearer of the knife. Immediately after the light allows him and Will to see each other's faces and realise their relation, he is killed by an arrow shot by Juta Kamainen. In The Amber Spyglass, after their deaths, he and Lee Scoresby, are amongst those set free by Lyra and Will from the world of the Dead. Instead of immediately dissolving into the universe, like the other dead, they both remain intact long enough to fight in the battle with the Authority. In the television series, Parry is portrayed by Andrew Scott. =Balthamos= Balthamos and his same-sex partner, Baruch, are both angels in rebellion from the Kingdom of Heaven. They seek to become part of Lord Asriel's army of angels and overthrow Metatron, the acting Regent of The Authority. Balthamos has a sarcastic personality, and his relations with Will are conducted with an air of ironic contempt. Both angels find Will Parry at the end of The Subtle Knife; because Will is the bearer of the subtle knife, they hope to bring him to Lord Asriel. However, Will's companion Lyra Belacqua has been kidnapped and Will refuses to go to Asriel until Lyra is found. The angels agree to accompany Will without question until she is found. When Baruch is killed in The Amber Spyglass, Balthamos, stricken with grief, promises to aid Will in every way possible to honour Baruch's sacrifice. When Balthamos is unable to do so, he runs away, grieving over Baruch's death and feeling guilty about abandoning Will. At the end of the book, he confronts and kills Father Gomez, an assassin hoping to kill Lyra, and dies himself. As angels of low rank, Balthamos and Baruch's abilities are limited. They appear as luminous humanlike forms, which are barely visible to human eyes even at night. The angels also possess the power to transform, which Balthamos uses to masquerade as Will's d√¶mon when travelling in Lyra's world. They are capable of flight though their wings do not have a corporeal form. =Baruch= Baruch and his same-sex partner, Balthamos, are both angels in rebellion from the Kingdom of Heaven. They seek to become part of Lord Asriel's army of angels and overthrow Metatron, the acting Regent of The Authority. When he was human, Baruch was brother to Enoch, who would become the angel Metatron. In The Subtle Knife, he and Balthamos meet Will and Lyra, but as they refuse to go to Lord Asriel right away, Baruch leaves them to bring Asriel the important information he has. In The Amber Spyglass, he dies bringing important information to Lord Asriel In Arabic-Christian legends, the name Baruch is identified with Zoroaster. The prophecy of the birth of Jesus from a virgin, and of his adoration by the Magi, is also ascribed to this Baruch.http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/2562-baruch =Chevalier Tialys and Lady Salmakia= The Chevalier Tialys and The Lady Salmakia are Gallivespians, spies, and companions of Lyra and Will. Gallivespians are a race of small humanoid beings about as tall as the length of a human hand from a world where humans, tending to side with the Church, are at war with them, and they serve as spies in Lord Asriel's army. Tialys and Salmakia in particular spy on the Magisterium in Lyra's world, and when the Magisterium sends soldiers to capture and kill Lyra, they are ordered to stow away and follow them. Gallivespians have poison spurs on their feet that can incapacitate a human, and they ride specially bred dragonflies. They first encounter the children when, along with Lord Asriel's forces, they arrive at Mrs Coulter's cave, under orders to take the children to Lord Asriel. The Gallivespians are forced to go with Lyra and Will when it becomes apparent that they will not go directly to Lord Asriel willingly. They travel together to the land of the dead, helping bargain with the harpies. Tialys dies when attacking a cliff-ghast, having dug his spurs deep into her neck; Lady Salmakia dies shortly thereafter, her short lifespan having reached its natural end. =Ruta Skadi= Ruta Skadi is the Latvian witch queen, and a lover of Lord Asriel. Her d√¶mon is a bluethroat named Sergi. She is 416 years old in The Subtle Knife, and makes appearances in The Subtle Knife and The Amber Spyglass. Her second name, \\"Skadi\\", is also that of a Nordic winter goddess. She accompanies Serafina Pekkala and her companions on part of their journey. She leaves, first to see the angels up above her, and she wants to help them because Lord Asriel is with them. She brings news of a mysterious weapon which turns out to be the Subtle Knife after overhearing tell of it from cliff ghasts. She is described as being very passionate, powerful, pitiless and beautiful, and has black hair and large black eyes. She wears a crown made of the teeth of tigers she killed when a tribe that worshipped them offended her. When it is revealed to the witches that Lyra, Lord Asriel and Marisa Coulter's daughter, is to become the second Eve, Ruta laments that as Asriel's lover, she did not become Lyra's mother, reflecting on what Lyra would have been like as a witch. In the stage adaptation, she commits suicide after killing John Parry, who had, in the past, rejected her as a lover. In the book, this is done by a more minor character (Juta Kamainen) who does not appear in the adaptation. =Father Gomez= Father Gomez is a priest sent by the Magisterium to assassinate Lyra. The Angel Balthamos kills Gomez before he can reach her. His d√¶mon is a green-backed beetle. He has spent years doing preemptive penance, allowing the Magisterium to forgive him for his planned crime of killing Lyra. =Fra Pavel= Fra Pavel Ra≈°ek is a representative and alethiometrist of the Consistorial Court of Discipline. He is said to be a thorough but sluggish reader of the truth, requiring weeks or months to take an accurate reading. He was, however, successful in obtaining information useful to the Consistorial Court in a relatively short period of time, according to Marisa Coulter. He appears to be uncomfortable when voicing potentially heretical discoveries. His d√¶mon takes the form of a frog. He appears in the 2007 film, where he is portrayed by Simon McBurney while Alan Shearman voices him in the video game adaption. In the TV series, he is portrayed by Frank Bourke. Introduced in The Amber Spyglass =The Authority= The Authority was the first angel to come into existence; he, and the angels he subsequently formed, condensed from the substance known as Dust. He led other angels and, later, humanity to believe that he was in fact God the creator of the multiverse. This false claim legitimised his taking political power in the Kingdom of Heaven. The angel Xaphania later found out the truth about him, whereupon he banished her from the Kingdom (a reference to the legend of Lucifer). Xaphania and some other angels later started a rebellion against him. The Authority would assume several names, including \\"Yahweh\\", the \\"Lord\\", \\"El\\", \\"Adonai\\", and \\"the Almighty\\". He ruled his various churches, organisations, and universes from the Clouded Mountain, a mobile city believed by many in that universe to be Heaven. As the Authority grew older and weaker, the Mountain became more and more obscured by cloud. In his old age, the Authority appointed the tyrannical archangel Metatron, to act as Regent of the Kingdom of Heaven. Eventually Metatron grew more powerful than his master. The two are opposed by Lord Asriel, who allies with \\"fallen\\" angels such as Xaphania in an attempt to overthrow the divine monarchy and replace it with a Republic of Heaven. During the final battle, the Authority is carried away from the Clouded Mountain on the orders of Metatron. He is imprisoned in a crystal box, which keeps him alive but trapped. Lyra Belacqua and Will Parry free him with the Subtle Knife, not knowing he is too weak to survive outside his box. He drifts apart and dies in a moment of happiness following other characters' precedent by merging with the cosmos. =Metatron= Metatron serves as the Regent of Heaven and is the ultimate antagonist of His Dark Materials. Metatron seeks to supplant the Authority, to destroy Lord Asriel and his army, and to kill the heroine Lyra Belacqua. He has immense personal power, and is shown as descending from the sky at one point to demolish a large area of land. He is betrayed by Mrs Coulter, who promises herself to him as a prize for his victory over Lord Asriel. However, she conspires with Asriel to destroy him; the two sacrifice their lives to drag Metatron into an abyss between the universes to ensure that he can never threaten Lyra again. Like one version of the traditional Metatron, he is stated to have been the Biblical character Enoch, who is in the line between Adam and Noah. He appears only in The Amber Spyglass. The name Metatron is that of a medieval Judaic Archangel. =Xaphania= Xaphania is the leader of the rebel angels allied with Lord Asriel in the war against The Authority. Xaphania first appears in the third book of the trilogy, The Amber Spyglass, at a council of Asriel's commanders. Like all Pullman's angels, she appears naked, winged, and luminous; due to her high rank and great age, she is clearly visible to corporeal beings. As is the norm with members of the angelic orders in the novels, there is a certain ambiguity surrounding Xaphania's exact appearance. She appears both ancient and young, compassionate and austere. Her simultaneous age and youth are remarked on by the witch Serafina Pekkala, who herself appears that way to shorter-lived people. The angel Balthamos is the first character to refer explicitly to Xaphania. As he explains to Will Parry, she discovered that the Authority had lied to the other angels regarding his status as God the original Creator and so was banished from the Clouded Mountain. This was the start of the first struggle against the Kingdom, Xaphania being the leader of the rebel angels who intervened in human evolution to give mankind its present consciousness some thirty thousand years ago. Towards the end of the trilogy, and after the defeat of the Authority's forces, it is Xaphania who explains to Will and Lyra Belacqua that all the windows between the worlds must be sealed to prevent Dust from leaking away into the abyss, and that the √Üsah√¶ttr (the Subtle Knife) must be destroyed. =Gracious Wings= Gracious Wings, previously called No-Name, is chief of the harpies in the Authority's employment in the Land of the Dead. Before Lyra and Will came, she, along with the other harpies, tormented the ghosts with all the mistakes made by those ghosts when they were alive. At first, she is ready to attack Lyra and Will but later confesses that the wickedness of the ghosts was the only nourishment given to her and the other harpies by the Authority. The Chevalier Tialys and the Lady Salmakia bargain with her that instead of wickedness, the ghosts will tell the harpies true stories from their lives and in exchange will be taken by the harpies to the window Will has opened into the world of the mulefa where the ghosts may peacefully dissolve into particles in the air. The harpies agree to this as, along with nourishment such stories would provide them, they would also keep their honour as they would be performing a useful and respected task. After she saves Lyra's life by stopping her from falling, Lyra names her Gracious Wings. Introduced in La Belle Sauvage =Malcolm Polstead= Malcolm Polstead and his d√¶mon Asta are eleven at the start of La Belle Sauvage. He is the protagonist of the story and is described as having \\"an inquisitive, kindly disposition, a stocky build, and ginger hair\\". His d√¶mon Asta has not yet settled into her final form. Malcolm is a regular visitor at the Priory of Saint Rosamund. During La Belle Sauvage, Malcolm is living and working with his parents at their tavern. He attends school locally, and the Magisterium is seen influencing the young children by inviting them into a special club intended to intimidate and inform on people and events viewed unfavourably by the Church; Malcolm manages to avoid participating. Malcolm is viewed as a helpful and friendly boy who frequently visits and helps the nuns who live at the nearby priory. Malcolm becomes fascinated by the infant Lyra and becomes privy to the fact she is being secretly raised by the sisters due to the nature of her birth parents. When Malcolm accidentally stumbles upon Oakley Street operatives, he begins to become involved in some spying due to wanting to protect the infant Lyra whom the Church appears to be after. Lord Asriel visits the priory and requests Malcolm's help in escaping capture after seeing the infant Lyra. Asriel has Malcolm's canoe upgraded by local Gyptians craftsmen, and leaves his card inviting Malcolm to call on him if help is needed. Gyptian Farder Coram warns Malcolm of the upcoming storm, during which Malcolm goes to the priory to ensure that the infant Lyra and sisters are safe. Malcolm rescues Alice and Lyra from being kidnapped by Gerard Bonneville. Malcolm kills the violent and insane Bonneville. He and Alice take the infant Lyra to Lord Asriel. By the time of Lyra's Oxford, Malcolm is a scholar at Jordan College. In The Secret Commonwealth, Dr Malcolm Polstead is a Professor of History at Durham College, at Oxford University in Lyra's world. Asta has settled as a large ginger cat. Malcolm has been Lyra's tutor. Now, he realises that he is in love with her. He is sent by Oakley Street to investigate the phenomenon of rose oil allowing for the perception of Dust. =Gerard Bonneville= Dr Gerard Bonneville is a disgraced physicist with a hyena d√¶mon. He studied the Rusakov field, and at some point became involved with Marisa Coulter. He was cut off from his research on Dust due to his work being labelled as heretical, and seeks to obtain Lyra to trade for the ability to work on his research again. Although Bonneville is seen as a charming handsome man, his hyena d√¶mon stands out in stark contrast to his own physical appearance. People find the creature unnerving and it has an aggressive nature. Bonneville has a history of violence, is shown to be going insane, and observed to be abusive towards his own d√¶mon ‚Äì cursing, hitting, and mutilating her by cutting off her front legs. Malcolm and other characters witness some of this with revulsion, as harming one's own d√¶mon is considered extremely disturbing act of self-mutilation. The text implies that Bonneville has paedophilic inclinations: Oakley Street agents discuss using Malcolm as bait to blackmail him, and he makes advances towards a fifteen-year-old Alice. In La Belle Sauvage, during the flood, Bonneville follows Malcolm, Alice, and Lyra. Bonneville attacks Alice on the steps of a mausoleum during a storm. Malcolm is forced to beat Bonneville to death with a canoe paddle. Malcolm inherits Bonneville's research notes, and an alethiometer which he gives to the Master of Jordan College, when Lord Asriel seeks academic sanctuary for the infant Lyra. =Alice Parslow (Mrs Lonsdale)= Alice Parslow and her d√¶mon Ben are 15 in La Belle Sauvage. In The Secret Commonwealth, Alice is revealed to be the same person as Mrs Lonsdale, the housekeeper of Jordan College who is a minor character in Northern Lights, by which time she has been married and widowed, Ben has settled as a terrier.

Almost all French pilots flying for the Arm√©e de l'Air at the outbreak of World War II had had their earliest flight training in this machine. It was the equivalent of the Stearman trainer in the United States air services and the de Havilland Tiger Moth in the British Royal Air Force. Development and design The MS.230 was designed to meet French Air Ministry requirements. The MS.230 was a parasol wing monoplane of metal tubular framing with fabric covering throughout, except the forward area of the fuselage, which was metal covered. The instructor and pupil occupied two tandem cockpits. It had a wide fixed landing gear that made it very stable in takeoff and landing. As a monoplane the MS.230 was unlike other trainers of the time, which were mostly biplanes. It first flew in February 1929 and proved to be an excellent and stable machine which was very easy to fly. It saw service with military flight schools throughout France and was exported to the air forces of numerous other countries. It also became a popular aircraft for sporting aviation. An example won the Michelin Cup in 1929. Numbers of MS.230s survived for many years after the war and became civilian trainers and civilian flying club aircraft. One was used in 1967 to act as camera-ship for air-to-air filming of Darling Lili at Baldonnel Aerodrome, Ireland. Examples are preserved on display in museums in Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Spain and the United States of America.Ogden, 2006, p. 28 Popular culture A MS.230 was used at the end of the movie The Blue Max as the \\"new monoplane\\" in which Lt.

A modified version of it served as the visual component to a phone-in quiz on ITV's Motormouth.The Bird Sanctuary The game was planned for release on Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum, but both versions were cancelled. Plot The background story is told by a 64-page novella with 19 chapters written by Rupert Goodwins, featuring the back-story of the game (plus serving as a copy protection). Steve is in love with his attractive coworker Emily. Unbeknownst to Steve, Emily is possessed by a daemon named Zelloripus who was banished to Earth, stripped of most of her powers, and trapped into a human female due to unspecified crimes done to other daemons. Emily sees a chance to let someone else suffer and stifle her boredom. She tricks Steve to take three pills she has mixed to \\"cure his flu\\". While the pills do cure him, they also grant Zelloripus access to his body and mind. His dreams become both more lucid and strange, each one getting more intense and painful. Steve's psychiatrist does not understand what causes the dreams, and neither does Steve. He refers him to a neurosurgeon. After his health dramatically declines, Steve undertakes brain surgery in an attempt to stop the dreams. Under an anaesthetic, he slips into one more dream, possibly his last. Gameplay The game starts where Rupert Goodwins' novella ends, with Steve lying on the operating table and slipping into the dream world. Steve is controlled by the player through numerous surreal worlds. He can collect certain weapons and items on these levels, but with a few exceptions, cannot carry them to another level. Steve has no health meter, but there is a heart rate monitor, which goes from 75bpm (normal) to 100bpm (in frightening situations) to 170bpm (shortly before death). He immediately dies if he comes into contact with an enemy or an obstacle. He can also die if he remains too long in certain areas such as the Country Garden, where a lawnmower will come and decimate him. When Steve dies, the game returns to the scene in the operating room where the surgeons attempt to save him. There are no save points in the game, and instead of score points the player's progress is stated as a percentage and a time counter. There are 15 different enemies/challenges, 7 different death animations and 5 different musical scores by C64/Amiga musician David Whittaker on the Amiga. Barry Leitch did the music for the Commodore 64 and PC version. Development The general plot was conceived by the developers, and Rupert Goodwins was asked to write the novella included with the game. The scenarios in the game are not based on Serrano's own nightmares, but are inspired by the paintings of Salvador Dal√≠, Terry Gilliam's cartoon animations for Monty Python, and on odd observations. After a visit to the dentist, Serrano developed a phobia of teeth, which is noticeable in the design of the monsters, many of them having mouths with large teeth. The game took over a year to produce. Reception =Critical reception= Weird Dreams received mixed reviews. While most critics praised its visual style, there were some criticisms depending on the game platform. Frustrating difficulty, long loading times, and a disappointing soundtrack were common criticisms, albeit not unanimous. =Promotion= Computer and Video Games did a competition called \\"Ooooh What a Nightmare Compo\\", which required participants to send a picture of their worst nightmares. The judging was done by a professional artist and the winners received blow-up fish bathtoys and Weird Dreams/Motormouth T-Shirts as prizes.

Early Life and education Growing up, Collins‚Äô parents fostered his interest in literature and art by taking him to museums, theatres and operas, and he worked at the local library in his hometown of Lexington, Massachusetts. Collins graduated with a BFA from the Massachusetts College of Art and Design in 1982, later receiving the college's Distinguished Alumnus Award in 2004. He also studied at Parsons School of Design in New York City, where he met artists such as Larry Rivers and Antonio Lopez (illustrator). Career After graduating college, Collins started his own studio in his parents‚Äô garage in Lexington, MA, working with clients including the Digital Equipment Corporation, John Hancock Financial, and Perkins School for the Blind. The company grew to a team of 20 and relocated to Concord, Massachusetts. Collins' interest in working on global brands led him to sell the business, and he spent a summer in London before being hired by The Duffy Design Group in Minneapolis, whose clients included Giorgio Armani, Jim Beam Brands, and Porsche. In 1995, Collins moved to FCB (advertising agency) in San Francisco to work on Levi Strauss & Co., Amazon, MTV, and The Walt Disney Company.

Hagney (20 March 1884 ‚Äì 25 June 1973) was an Australian actor. Born in Sydney in 1884, Hagney appeared in more than 350 Hollywood films between 1919 and 1966. Most of his film roles were small and uncredited. Because of his tall and strong appearance, Hagney often played officers or henchmen. He is perhaps best-known as Mr. Potter's silent, wheelchair-pushing valet in Frank Capra's classic It's a Wonderful Life (1946). Hagney was also a guest star on more than 70 television programs such as The Cisco Kid, The Adventures of Kit Carson, The Lone Ranger, The Rifleman, Perry Mason, and Daniel Boone.

Particularly with her work in both Australia and Africa, she paved the way for a feminist approach in anthropological studies. Her research on the sacred life and significant role of the Aboriginal women of Australia proved to be a controversial topic, as anthropology during her years of early fieldwork was male-dominated, filled with the misconceptions that men were the superior in any aspect of life. Contributing proof of women's significance to societal development and organisation, Kaberry can be defined as an influential and significant anthropologist.  Early life  Kaberry was born in San Francisco. Her parents were British immigrants, originally from Yorkshire. They emigrated not long before Kaberry's birth. Both were Christian Scientists; her father an architect. In 1913, Kaberry, her parents and two brothers moved to New South Wales, Australia, and eventually to Sydney. Kaberry attended the Fort Street Girls' High School and in 1930 entered the University of Sydney where she would remain until obtaining her master's degree.Toussaint, Sandy (1999). Phyllis Kaberry and Me. Carlton: Melbourne University Press.  Education  *1933: BA in English and philosophy; also emphasis on Latin and history ‚Äì University of Sydney *1934: MA in anthropology, University of Sydney *1938: PhD in anthropology, London School of Economics  Academic career  The University of Sydney was the first university in Australia to teach anthropology. The university was once an academic home to anthropologists such as A.P. Elkin, Raymond Firth, Ian Hogbin, A.R. Radcliffe-Brown, and Camilla Wedgwood. Kaberry studied under A.P. Elkin, a firm believer that female anthropologists were able to give a unique and beneficial perspective of women in various societies ‚Äì a subject neglected during this time.Marcus, Julie, ed. (1993). First in their Field: Women and Australian Anthropology. Carlton: Melbourne University Press. During her first years as a graduate student, Kaberry took an interest in New Guinea. Her master's thesis was the result of this interest, and was a survey of the effects of government policies on native conditions. Such an issue would also be seen in her later work in Australia and Africa. She would later renew her Melanesian interests after 1939 when she travelled to New Guinea to study the social organisation among the Abelam people of the Sepik District. She became curious in Melanesian diet, specifically the central role yams played. Unfortunately, the effects of World War II shortened her stay. =Research in Kimberley region of Western Australia= After completing her master's degree in anthropology, Kaberry received a grant from the Australian National Research Council (ANRC) to conduct research within the country. Her advisor, Elkin, suggested her fieldwork reside in the Kimberley region of Western Australia to study the Aborigines. Elkin was a large advocate for the humane treatment and preservation of the native Australian populations ‚Äì his views driven by his awareness of poor living conditions, maltreatment, and the gradual erasing of their traditional beliefs and values. Following Elkin's advice, Kaberry travelled to the Kimberley region. Like what many anthropologists face in the field, Kaberry dealt with difficult conditions, all of which she embraced. Conducting research among cattle and mission stations, she encountered language barriers and constant resettlement due to seasonal migrations ‚Äì hence a mobile lifestyle. Adopting a participant observation approach, Kaberry shifted between multiple groups of people, becoming deeply involved with the daily lifestyles of the women. Often needing a translator, she chose the most outspoken woman of each group to assist her with translation as well as a way to entice other women into speaking about private aspects of Aboriginal female life. Much of her work was dependent on the two distinct seasons. During the dry season, Kaberry resided in the cattle and mission stations collecting genealogies by interviewing women from various camps. Kaberry questioned the accuracy of her research of Aboriginal tradition during the dry season. This was because the lifestyle within the cattle and mission stations established by non-natives was altered by European contact. She found that Aboriginal traditional life was more prominent in the wet season. Kaberry witnessed traditional ceremonies and real customs ‚Äì an opportunity to see \\"native life\\" as it once was. Over the roughly three years that she studied the Aborigines society of the Kimberely region, she focused on kinship, religion, the economic and social organisation of women, as well as the influence of European contact. After returning from the field, she enrolled in the London School of Economics after receiving a scholarship. In 1938, she received her PhD in anthropology, and one year later published Aboriginal Woman Sacred and Profane. This book had a quiet but strong impact on women studies in the field of anthropology. At the time of publication, anthropology was widely male dominated, and thus her book received great amounts of criticism for suggesting that women were equal to that of men and possessed their own value of sacredness. Women at this time were seen as \\"domesticated cows\\" and erotic beings thought to have little influence in cultural development, devoid of a sacred life with their institutions defined as inferior to those of males. Although he was interested in obtaining information on the lives of women in native societies, even Kaberry's mentor, Elkin, exhibited views that agreed with the common belief of women inferiority. Aboriginal Woman Sacred and Profane disputed these ideas: > Until recently, aboriginal woman has occupied rather an obscure place in > Australian anthropology; and in popular imagination, at least, she has too > often been lost to view beneath the burdens imposed upon her by her menfolk. > There has been little attempt to analyse the extent to which she > participates in religion, the nature and importance of her contribution to > the tribal economy. It was with the object of making a more specific study > of the position of women in an aboriginal community, that at the suggestion > of Professor Elkin, I carried out research in North-West Australia [‚Ä¶] In > its original form my material was presented as a thesis for the degree of > Doctor of Philosophy at the London School of Economics in 1938; but since > then it has been revised and abridged and the title changed to one that sums > up my attempt to portray aboriginal woman as she really is ‚Äì a complex > social personality, having her own prerogatives, duties, problems, beliefs, > rituals, and point of view; making the adjustments that the social, local, > and totemic organisation require of her, and at the same time exercising a > certain freedom of choice in matters affecting her own interests and desires > [‚Ä¶] Nevertheless they possess totems, have spiritual affiliations with the > sacred past, and perform their own sacred rites from which the men are > excluded [‚Ä¶] we have no grounds for assuming on the data now available, that > the men represent the sacred element in the community and the women the > profane element. (p. xix -xxii) Kaberry recorded sacred ceremonies among women and exhibited the integral part they play within society. Her book was one of three focusing on the Aborigines of Australia by anthropologists during the 1930s, as well as one of few that described native women worldwide. No doubt, she set the scene for future women studies, a field that was strongly neglected until women's movements later in the century. =Malinowski and culture contact consequences= Awarded a Sterling Fellowship, Kaberry went to Yale University to present lectures on her research in Australia and Melanesia. There she met with Bronis≈Çaw Malinowski once again, her mentor at the London School of Economics. Kaberry and Malinowski shared an interest in culture contact and its consequences. Both agreed to write a book together on the subject, however Malinowski died before it was finished. With his notes in hand, Kaberry completed the project in 1945, entitled The Dynamics of Cultural Change. Kaberry had much admiration for Malinowski, and later dedicated Aboriginal Woman Sacred and Profane to him. As stated in her book: > I have dedicated this book to Professor Malinowski in acknowledgment of my > debt to him as an anthropologist, as one who, without sacrificing scientific > objectivity and integrity to fact, has been able to approach the study of > culture and civilization with the imagination and sensitiveness of an > artist. (p. xxv) Almost twenty years later she wrote \\"A Glimpse of Malinowski in Retrospect\\" for the Journal of the Anthropological Society in Oxford. =Research in Bamenda region of Cameroon= Kaberry moved back to London, and eventually received a request from the Colonial Social Science Research Council to do research in the Bamenda region of Cameroon. The Council questioned the low development and malnutrition in this colonised region and requested Kaberry's anthropological services. Funded by the British government, Kaberry travelled to Bamenda, living among the Nso'. Here, she formed close relationships with those that she worked with. The Nso' highly valued her friendship and the issues she helped to resolve within their community. In 1946, the loss of land was becoming a reality to the Nso' due to colonial policies. Kaberry voiced her concerns to the British, in which the problem was eventually resolved. Relieved and grateful, the Nso' made Kaberry a Queen Mother ‚Äì a title Kaberry cherished greatly. Kaberry spent close to a total of forty-six months in Bamenda between 1945 and 1963 partly in collaboration with Sally Chilver. In 1952 she wrote Women of the Grasslands, describing the economic position of Nso' women. This publication did not receive as much criticism as her former book, but was yet another important movement towards a feminist approach in the field of anthropology. For the latter part of her academic career, Kaberry taught at University College London as a lecturer and later as a reader. One year after her retirement, she died of accidental alcohol poisoning in her London home at sixty-seven years old. Informed of Kaberry's death, the Nso' community she had worked with throughout the years performed a mourning ceremony in her honour, and ten years later founded the Kaberry Research Centre within their region. At Oxford University, the Centre for Cross- Cultural Research on Women hosts a memorial lecture every three years, honouring her contributions to women's studies.  Contributions  Phyllis Mary Kaberry was a pioneer for the study of women in the field of anthropology. For her to overcome the constant criticisms of her work was a battle within academia. Her passion and dedication towards erasing the misconceptions of the value of women within different societies has greatly benefited the future of the anthropological field of study. Kaberry recognised women's significant contributions within their communities, proving that they are not confined to the shadow of men. Her work has influenced future generations of anthropologists, including Sandy Toussaint of the University of Western Australia, and author of Phyllis Kaberry and Me. Kaberry Place, in the Canberra Suburb of Chisholm, is named in her honour.

History The Post Newspapers group was established as the Subiaco Post by reporter Bret Christian and his wife Bettye in September 1977 at a house in Churchill Avenue, Subiaco. The first edition was published in September 1977. The paper moved to a former wine saloon in Keightley Road, Subiaco, in 1979, and moved again to Onslow Road in Shenton Park in 2006. The Post started as a monthly, became fortnightly in 1978 and went to weekly publication from 26 November 1980. While continuing to publish the Subiaco Post, the Post Newspapers developed other suburban editions: Nedlands Post in April 1978, Claremont Post in July 1978, Cottesloe Post in August 1979, Mosman Park Post in November 1980 (the Cottesloe and Mosman Park edition were combined at that time), and the Cambridge Post (formerly Floreat) in October 1981. All four are still published. The Posts distribution area reaches as far south as North Fremantle, as far north as Wembley Downs and Woodlands, and as far east as West Perth and West Leederville. The Posts Time Out section has arts coverage; reviews of films, books and restaurants; and an agony aunt column by Wayne and Tamara Mitchell (www.WayneAndTamara.com). The page 4 Listening Post feature first appeared in 1989: the column includes gossipy or curious items. A semi- regular feature is photographs of people reading the paper at well-known tourist destinations or places of historic note. The first was published in 1993, when a Nedlands resident was photographed with the Post at the top of Mt Kilimanjaro, in Tanzania. Other residents have posed with the paper at the Giza pyramids in Egypt, in front of Table Mountain in South Africa and underwater at the Great Barrier Reef.

Hit singles The Exciting Wilson Pickett launched four crossover hit singles. \\"In the Midnight Hour\\" reached #1 on the Billboard R&B; singles chart and #21 on the pop singles chart. \\"Land of a Thousand Dances\\" reached #1 and #6 respectively, his biggest pop hit. \\"Ninety-nine and a Half (Won't Do)\\" reached #13 and #53. \\"634-5789 (Soulsville, U.S.A.)\\", a song which Pickett had not on first hearing liked, reached #1 and #13. Pickett later redid the song \\"Land of a Thousand Dances\\", originally a hit in 1963 for New Orleans-based composer Chris Kenner, for the soundtrack of The Great Outdoors, a 1988 film starring Dan Aykroyd and John Candy.

This show aired 27 October 1970 and was recorded 10 September 1970. The episode featured sketches including \\"Blackmail\\", \\"Society for Putting Things on Top of Other Things\\", \\"Accidents Sketch (Prawn Salad Ltd.)\\" and \\"The Butcher Who is Alternately Rude and Polite\\". Introduction The program begins with John Cleese (ostentatiously portraying himself) speaking \\"live\\" from a table at the Grill-O-Mat snack bar in Paignton; followed by the opening credits. Serving as the official host for the entire episode, he provides a means by which to link the various sketches together. \\"Blackmail\\" This sketch features Michael Palin wearing a leopard-print jacket as the host of a television show which attempts to blackmail its viewers by showing pictures or film of them engaging in compromising acts of a sexual nature. The address to where the blackmailed viewers are to send their payments is \\"Behind The Hot Water Pipes, Third Washroom Along, Victoria Station\\". \\"Society for Putting Things on Top of Other Things\\" In this sketch, Sir William (Graham Chapman), the President of the Royal Society for Putting Things on Top of Other Things, tells about how their Staffordshire branch has not succeeded on putting one thing on top of another before Cutler (John Cleese) who is delegate of Staffordshire, tells him that the whole branch thinks the whole thing is a bit silly. After some objections, Sir William agrees and dissolves the society before going out for a pipe. As he does so, he finds himself on film and goes to another door to see film, and out a window. He informs the society of the predicament and after they did a round of checking it out, they decide to tunnel their way out as well as vaulting over a vaulting horse while two Germans (Ian Davidson and Terry Gilliam) mock them about their predicament before Cutler called out that he had just found another exit. The moment they got through, they are sent down a tunnel, into someone's digestive system. \\"Current Affairs\\" Mr. Praline (Cleese) and his roommate, Brooky (Idle), do a new half hour show on current affairs, but due to the show being too long, their scene has been cut, the floor manager (Terry Jones) tells them about this, but gives them an offer to appear in another sketch if they can find a piano stool. After accepting it, Praline hears something and placed his ear down into the floor to hear the Society of Putting Things on Top of Other Things travelling down a pipe. This later followed an animation of the society entering a mech-like figure and as they manage to control it, they end up defeated by another one before Sir William is knocked into \\"The Last Supper\\", spilling an entire bottle of Chateau Latour before he is sent into a cloud where he reunites with the other members. Some people on another cloud tells them not to jump as the fire brigade, on a red cloud, are coming before they're shot down by a Nazi on a cloud-like jet as the members notice him coming back. \\"Accidents Sketch (Prawn Salad Ltd.)\\" Eric Idle plays an innocent-looking but seemingly accident-prone man who enters an establishment called 'Prawn Salad Ltd', and is blamed for setting off a series of catastrophic events. During the course of about a minute of sketch time, circumstantial evidence relentlessly piles up indicating that Idle's character breaks an expensive mirror, knocks over an ornate bookcase, fatally stabs the maid (Carol Cleveland), causes the handy man to fall out the window to his death, induces an investigating policeman into a fatal heart attack, collapses the roof in on the butler who was trying to help the policeman, and finally, causes the entire 'Prawn Salad Ltd' building to explode. The running gag of the skit is that while everyone in the sketch is convinced of the Idle character's complicity, the viewer is perfectly aware of his innocence in the series of events. \\"The Butcher Who is Alternately Rude and Polite\\" Michael Palin plays a customer at a butcher's attempting to buy a chicken and some stuffing, but is confused by the butcher (Eric Idle) who is alternately rude (\\"Don't give me that posh talk you nasty stuck-up twit\\") and polite (\\"That's all right sir, call again.\\") Palin's character attempts to ignore the rude comments at first, but later confronts the proprietor about his behavior. The sketch ends after Idle's characters' last rude comment by going back to Cleese's narrator character at the eponymous Grill-O-Mat, who has appeared between most of the sketches as a method of linking the sketches. The sketch is preceded by an animation of two identical United States Civil War generals, one of whom expresses his desire to \\"hunt piggy banks\\". The figures are actually photographs of U.S. military figure and Massachusetts governor Benjamin Franklin Butler.

Rail transportation has existed in Oregon in some form since 1855, and the state was a pioneer in development of electric railway systems. While the automobile has displaced many uses of rail in the state (as elsewhere), rail remains a key means of moving passengers and freight, both within the state and to points beyond its borders. History The first railway in Oregon was proposed by Byron J. Pengra, Surveyor General of Oregon, along the Oregon Central Military Wagon Road in 1864, but Oregon's first railroad ended up being the Oregon Portage Railroad. Henry Villard's Oregon Railway and Navigation Company established transcontinental rail lines with Northern Pacific in 1880, then with Union Pacific in 1881 (through the latter's Oregon Short Line). Twenty-first century network As of 2004, the state of Oregon has over (route-miles) of track, and of railroad right-of-way after peaking in the 1930s at about of track. Oregon is served by two Class 1 railroads, which account for over of trackage, and over twenty Class 2 and Class 3 operators. Three Amtrak routes serve the state, primarily through the Willamette Valley and south-central Oregon. Rail is a key element of the mass transit system in the city of Portland and surrounding communities. And numerous tourist railways operate in the state. =Freight rail= Oregon is currently served by two Class 1 railroads, the BNSF Railway and the Union Pacific Railroad (UP). Prior to its acquisition by the UP in 1996, Oregon was also served by the Southern Pacific Transportation Company; the UP continues to operate on tracks acquired from the SP. Union Pacific The UPRR operates several mainlines in the state. The primary north/south UP mainline enters Oregon from California south of Klamath Falls, runs north through Central Oregon up to Chemult, then proceeds northwest via the Willamette Pass to Eugene. From Eugene, it then turns north again up the Willamette Valley, passing through cities including Albany, Salem, Woodburn, Canby, Oregon City, Milwaukie, terminating in Portland. The primary east/west UP mainline starts in Portland and heads east towards Troutdale where it enters the Columbia Gorge. It passes through the gorge on the Oregon side, serving cities such as Hood River, The Dalles, Boardman, and Hermiston. In the Hermiston area, the line branches; with one line heading northeast to Spokane, Washington; the other heading southeast roughly parallel to the old Oregon Trail and modern- day Interstate 84, passing through Pendleton, La Grande, Baker City, and Ontario before entering Idaho. In addition to the mainlines, the UPRR also operates several branch lines in the state, serving the terminal district of Portland, the city of Umatilla, and the community of Pilot Rock. BNSF The BNSF operates one significant mainline in the state, serving Central Oregon. The BNSF line enters the state southeast of Klamath Falls, joining the UPRR mainline there. The two lines share trackage between Klamath Falls and Chemult until the UPRR branches off towards Eugene; the BNSF continues in a northeasterly direction through central Oregon, providing service to Bend, Redmond and Madras. The line continues north of Madras along the Deschutes River until it interchanges with the UPRR mainline east of The Dalles; it then crosses the Columbia River and intersects with the BNSF mainline on the Washington side. The BNSF also operates a mainline in the Portland area which is a key rail link despite having only approximately ten miles of trackage in Oregon; this link crosses the Columbia River into Vancouver, connecting with the BNSF line heading north to Seattle, as well as the BNSF line heading east along the Washington side of the Columbia Gorge, towards the Tri-Cities and Spokane. (Eastbound Amtrak service from Portland crosses into Vancouver and uses the BNSF tracks, not the UPRR tracks in Oregon.) Portland Terminal Railroad The Portland Terminal Railroad (PTRC) is a joint terminal railroad of the UPRR and the BNSF, which operates several key rail lines, as well as the Guild's Lake Yard, within the city of Portland. The PTRR facilitates interchange between the two Class 1 railroads; each railways' trains are considered \\"home\\" while on PTRC trackage. It was called the Northern Pacific Terminal Company until changing its name to the Portland Terminal Railroad Company in 1965, at which time it was jointly owned by the Northern Pacific, Union Pacific and Southern Pacific railroads.\\"Name shifted by Terminal\\". The Oregonian, November 2, 1965, p. 17. Short lines Beaverton In addition to the two Class 1 carriers, there are numerous short line operators in the state of Oregon, with miles of trackage. Many places in Oregon, such as Washington, Yamhill, Polk, and Benton counties in the Willamette Valley; numerous communities in the Cascade foothills, the Oregon Coast, all of Southwestern Oregon, and the Wallowa Mountains, are not reachable via the Class 1 mainlines. Short line operators include: * Albany and Eastern Railroad. This railway provides service to Albany, Lebanon, and Sweet Home. * Central Oregon and Pacific Railroad (CORP), a subsidiary of RailAmerica, provides service to Southwestern Oregon and northwestern California. Main line is former SP line over Siskiyou Pass between Eugene and Weed, California; cities served include Eugene, Cottage Grove, Roseburg, Grants Pass, Medford, and Ashland. Until September 2007, CORP operated a second line from Eugene to Coquille via Florence, Reedsport, and Coos Bay. This latter line closed at that time, but was sold in 2009 to the Port of Coos Bay, which reopened it in 2011‚Äì2013 as Coos Bay Rail Link. * City of Prineville Railway. Connects the BNSF mainline in Redmond with the city of Prineville. * Hampton Railway. Serves the Hampton lumber mill in Fort Hill, Oregon; interchanges with the PNWR in Willamina. * Idaho Northern and Pacific Railroad (INPR). Runs from the UPRR mainline in LaGrande to Elgin. * Klamath Northern. Operates a branch line in Central Oregon, connecting Gilchrest to the UPRR mainline. * Modoc Northern Railroad. Serves Central Oregon and northern California; in particular the Oregon cities of Klamath Falls and Lakeview. * Mount Hood Railroad (MHRR). Connects Hood River with Parkdale. Primarily an excursion railway, but does handle some freight. * Oregon Pacific Railroad. Operates two branch lines off the UPRR mainline, one serving the Sellwood neighborhood of Portland; the other connecting Liberal to the mainline in Canby. * Palouse River and Coulee City Railroad (PCC). Operates two branch lines in the state, one from Arlington to Shutler; the other from Walla Walla, Washington to Milton-Freewater and Weston. * Peninsula Terminal Company (PTRR). Serves terminal operations in north Portland. * Port of Tillamook Bay Railroad (POTB). Operated between Tillamook and the Portland metropolitan area, interchanging with the PNWR in Washington County, until a December 2007 storm caused extensive damage to its main line that has not been repaired. * Portland and Western Railroad (PNWR)/Willamette and Pacific Railroad (WPRR). Provides service to much of northwestern Oregon, including the lower Columbia River (Astoria, Rainier, St. Helens), Portland's western suburbs (Beaverton, Hillsboro, Forest Grove, Tigard, Lake Oswego, Tualatin, Sherwood, and Wilsonville), much of the Willamette Valley (Newberg, McMinnville, Willamina, Salem, Albany, Eugene, Corvallis), and the coastal city of Toledo. * Wallowa Union Railroad Authority. Runs between the INPR in Elgin, and Enterprise. * WCTU Railway. Provides service to White City. * Willamette Valley Railway. Runs from the UPRR mainline in Woodburn to Stayton, serving the cities of Mt. Angel and Silverton. * Wyoming and Colorado Railroad. Runs from the UPRR mainline in Ontario to Vale and Celatom. =Passenger service= Rail is also used in the state to provide both long- haul passenger service, as well as commuter and intra-urban transit, and excursion trains. Amtrak Long-haul passenger service is provided by Amtrak, which operates in Oregon on the north-south Union Pacific mainline south of Portland, and on BNSF tracks into Washington to the north and east. Three Amtrak routes provide service to Oregon: * The Coast Starlight, running from Seattle, Washington to Los Angeles, California provides service to Portland, Salem, Albany, Eugene, Chemult, and Klamath Falls. * The Amtrak Cascades, running from Vancouver, British Columbia to Eugene, serves Portland, Oregon City, Salem, Albany, and Eugene. * The Empire Builder, running from Portland to Chicago, Illinois, provides service to Portland. Immediately after departing Portland, the train crosses into Washington, and does not serve any other Oregon community. In Portland, the Amtrak depot is Union Station, located in downtown. Active Amtrak depots are also located in Oregon City, Salem, Albany, Eugene, Chemult, and Klamath Falls. Transit and commuter rail Rail transit is a key part of the local and regional transportation network in Portland and its surrounding communities. Two electrically powered rail systems and one diesel-powered commuter rail system presently provide transit service in the Portland metropolitan area. Banfield Freeway (I-84) * The MAX Light Rail system, a light rail system operated by TriMet (the transit authority for the Portland area), presently serves the cities of Portland, Beaverton, Hillsboro, and Gresham on four separate lines. The first line opened in 1986, running for east from downtown Portland to Gresham. A second line opened in 1998, extending the system west from downtown to Beaverton and Hillsboro, and this was operated as an extension of the eastside line, the combined route being designated the Blue Line in 2000‚Äì2001. The Red Line opened in 2001, providing service to Portland International Airport; the Yellow Line opened in 2004, with service to north Portland; and the Green Line opened in 2009, with service to Clackamas. In 2015, service was extended to Milwaukie, with the opening of the Orange Line. Planning is under way for an extension of MAX through Southwest Portland and Tigard to Bridgeport Village, in northern Tualatin, known for now as the Southwest Corridor Project. Portland Streetcar * The Portland Streetcar is an electrically powered streetcar (or tram) system with two lines, which serves downtown Portland and adjacent areas. The first line, opened in 2001 and later designated the NS Line, runs between the Northwest district and the South Waterfront district, also providing service to the Pearl District and Portland State University (PSU). Unlike MAX, which primarily runs in its own right-of-way, the streetcar shares most of its right-of-way with vehicular traffic. A second line, the CL Line, was opened in 2012, serving the Central Eastside District and the Lloyd District before crossing the Broadway Bridge to join the NS Line and follow its downtown section south as far as PSU. Although CL was short for Central Loop, the line was not a complete loop until 2015, when the opening of the Tilikum Crossing bridge across the Willamette River (as part of the MAX Orange Line project) allowed its two southern ends to be connected. The CL line was extended across the new bridge and renamed Loop Service, with the clockwise service being the A Loop and the counterclockwise service being the B Loop. The streetcar system interchanges with both the MAX system and the Portland Aerial Tram, an aerial cableway that opened to the public in 2007. The NS Line has been and extended three times since its 2001 opening and is currently end- to-end. The CL line extended the system by in 2012, and its 2015 extension added another of new route to the streetcar system. WES commuter rail car * The Westside Express Service is a diesel-powered commuter rail service which began operating in early 2009 and runs between the cities of Beaverton and Wilsonville on previously existing freight trackage. It has three intermediate stops, two of which serve the cities of Tigard and Tualatin, and connects with MAX at the Beaverton Transit Center. The vehicles are operated by Portland and Western Railroad under contract with TriMet, but the transit agency owns the DMU-type rail cars and maintenance facility (and employs the vehicle maintenance personnel), and most funding for operations comes from TriMet. Tourist railways The Mount Hood Railroad Numerous tourist and excursion, and heritage railways operate in the state of Oregon. Among them are: * The Mount Hood Railroad provides excursion trains between the cities of Hood River and Parkdale. The railroad also provides limited freight service. * The Washington Park and Zoo Railway is a narrow-gauge railroad in Portland's Washington Park which takes passengers around the grounds of the Oregon Zoo. Until 2013, the line also included a longer section running through the forested park to a stop near the International Rose Test Garden and Portland Japanese Garden, but that section was not reopened following a 2013‚Äì2014 suspension for renovation, and is now planned to remain closed permanently.

He hails from Thikana \\"Palaitha\\", a premier principality of the erstwhile Kotah State in Rajasthan. He represented Kotah state in the Constituent Assembly of India from 1946 to 1950. Education and early life Apji Dalel Singh completed his schooling from Herbert School at Kotah and then went on to Banaras Hindu University, one of the most prestigious Universities in India of that time and even of today. He studied Political Science and earned his Master of Arts in the same subject in 1932. An ardent cricketer, he played on the University Cricket team as 1 of the 2 opening batsmen. Story goes that during his master's degree, he played on behalf of the university staff against the students' team where the staff made 121 runs and lost. Alas, his \\"modest\\" score of 110 not out couldn't help them to win the match. After his University studies, he travelled to London to study for the Indian Civil Service Exam. On narrowly missing the opportunity, he travelled back to India and decided to work for his cousin, the Maharaja of Jaipur, HH Sawai Man Singh II in the state government, where he served as Secretary in various ministries. In 1945, the Maharao of Kotah, HH Bhim Singh II asked him to return to Kotah and represent the state at New Delhi in the Constituent Assembly of India. The years as a Member of Parliament During the late 1940s he was a member of the Constituent Assembly of India and got the opportunity to live in Delhi and see firsthand the process of Indian Independence. His work brought him in close proximity to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Pt. Heera Lal Shastri and Sir V. T. Krishnamachari amongst others. Representing the States in the Assembly he often spoke on behalf of and for the rights of the States. Therefore, at times he was at opposing end of the views of Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru and the Indian National Congress. Some of these incidences disillusioned him with Indian Politics. Later life After the end of term of the Constituent Assembly of India in January 1950, Pt. Heera Lal Shastri invited him to join his ministry in Jaipur after he became the Chief Minister of Rajasthan. But having been disillusioned with politics, he politely declined and decided to work for the state of Kotah, which he did even after the merger of the States in the Republic in 1952. Illness and death During the last two years of his life, Apji Dalel Singh suffered from ill health. On 8 March 1984, he suffered a heart attack and died in his sleep. He was cremated at Kotah.

She is best known for her leading roles in the television dramas Prince Hours and Single Dad in Love. Career Huh E-jae began her entertainment career by modeling for magazines when she was a high school student. After making her acting debut in 2004, she was given the nickname \\"Little Kim Tae-hee\\" due to her resemblance to the popular actress. Huh first appeared in several sitcoms on KBS followed by supporting roles, notably as Kim Rae-won's love interest in the 2006 gangster film Sunflower. In 2007, Huh got her big break when she was cast in the female leading role in Prince Hours (also known as Goong S). She and Seven played childhood best friends whose lives are changed when he turns out to be a member of the Korean royal family. Unlike its predecessor Princess Hours, Goong S received low ratings. But it made Huh into a household name, and that year, she won recognition at Andre Kim's Best Star Awards and the Premiere Rising Star Awards (held during the PIFF). An indie film she shot in 2006, A Boy Who is Walking in the Sky (the early working title was Da Capo), was released in 2008. Huh played the protagonist, a tomboy who helps a mute eight- year-old boy (played by Kang San) find the mother who abandoned him. She then starred opposite Oh Ji-ho in Single Dad in Love, where she played a medical student from a wealthy family who falls for a single father who makes a living as a K-1/mixed martial arts fighter. That same year, Huh became a host/MC for Inkigayo; she and co-host Eun Ji-won hosted the music program from May 11 to November 30, 2008. In 2009, Huh left her agency, Bae Yong-joon's BOF (Boundaries of Forest), and transferred to YG Entertainment.\\"Huh E-jae\\" . YG Entertainment. Retrieved 2011. She then joined the Telecinema project, seven Korea-Japan joint productions that both received a limited theater release and were broadcast on television (SBS in South Korea, and TV Asahi in Japan). In 19-Nineteen, Huh, T.O.P and Seungri played nineteen-year-old teenagers who become fugitives from the law after being falsely accused of murder. Later that year, she was also one of the lead stars of the romantic comedy film Girlfriends, in which her college student character shares a boyfriend with Kang Hye-jung and Han Chae-young, but all three women nevertheless become friends. Personal life Huh married businessman Lee Seung-woo on January 15, 2011. She didn't renew her contract with YG Entertainment, and announced that she was putting her career activities on hold while transitioning to married life. The couple divorced in 2015, after which Huh decided to return to acting.

Early life and career He was born to an Estonian Swedish father and Russian mother in LiepƒÅja; he grew up in LiepƒÅja and studied both painting and photography. Tisse started his career as a newsreel cameraman working under difficult conditions. From 1916 to 1918, he worked as a military cameraman. In 1921, Tisse became a professor at Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography. His career didn't take off until working with director Sergei Eisenstein on the film Strike. Tisse would become Eisenstein's standard cinematographer for the next twenty years. Tisse, along with Eisenstein and Grigori Alexandrov went on a trip in 1929. They traveled to Europe and the United States with the intent of finding new sound equipment and creating connections between Hollywood and the Soviet film industry. Eisenstein signed with Paramount Pictures and trio headed to California. They worked on several pictures, but nothing was actually produced. Through Eisenstein, photojournalist Margaret Bourke-White met Tisse and in 1932, collaborated with her on Eyes on Russia (1933); this would be Bourke-White's only attempt at film making. In 1942, Tisse worked on the film In The Mountains of Yugoslavia with soviet filmmaker Abram Room. The film focused on the character Slavko Babic, his life and death, as well as the Yugoslav-Partisan liberation during World War II. The film proved to be very influential for future Yugoslav filmmakers. His favorite camera was the Debrie Parvo, which he continued to use even during the sound era to film silent sequences.

He was the sixth (third surviving) son of Johann Georg I, Elector of Saxony, and his second wife Magdalene Sibylle of Prussia. Life As a younger son, Christian had little prospect of inheriting the Electorate of Saxony, and instead received from his father in 1650 the administration of the former Bishopric of Merseburg, which had been confiscated after the Reformation. He was also elected by the Chapter of the cathedral. In a testament signed on 20 July 1652, the Elector John George I settled on an official division of the Albertine lands. Christian moved to Merseburg with his wife and children on 30 September 1653 and set up a household of his own. His court soon encompassed 150 people. Christian took formal possession of his lands on 22 April 1657, a few months after the funeral of his father on 27 January 1657. According to the will of John George I, Christian received Merseburg and the cities of Bad Lauchst√§dt, Schkeuditz, L√ºtzen, and Zwenkauand with their castles, half of the towns of Brehna, Z√∂rbig, and Finsterwalde, and the Margraviate of Lower Lusatia, including the towns and castles of L√ºbben, Dobrilugk, Finsterwalde, Guben, Luckau, Calau, and Spremberg; this settlement created the Duchy of Saxe-Merseburg with Christian as its ruler. When the House of Biberstein became extinct on 9 January 1668, Christian became ruler of Forst, with all its castles and vassal villages, including D√∂bern in the Electorate of Saxony, which created new disputes with his brother, John George II, its ruler. On 11 August a formal division of the new territories was settled on. By this agreement, the towns of Delitzsch and Bitterfeld (which Christian received in 1660), plus Z√∂rbig, were returned to the Electorate of Saxony. Nonetheless, Z√∂rbig was given back to Christian in 1681. On 25 November 1659, Christian gave Count Erdmann Leopold of Promnitz his approval to permit some Protestant refugees from Silesia, mainly from the duchies of Sagan and Glogau, to live quietly in Neudorf. In his honor, they renamed the village Christiansdorf (now known as Krzystkowice). Christian's older brother, John George II, found himself frustrated by his late father's will, since it divided the lands of the Electorate contrary to the principle of primogeniture. He tried to retrieve the lands of his brothers (including Christian), because he feared that the unity of the Electorate was in danger; finally, after several discussions, Christian and his younger brothers reluctantly accepted the overlordship of the Elector. However, the Elector John George III, son of John George II, tried again to retrieve the appanages of his uncles and cousins by annulling prior agreements upon his accession in 1680. For the rest of his reign, Christian was perpetually threatened with open conflict with his nephew the Elector. In 1655 Christian I was accepted into the Fruitbearing Society. Marriage and issue In Dresden on 19 November 1650, Christian married Christiana, a daughter of Philip, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg- Gl√ºcksburg in a double marriage in which his brother Maurice married Christiana's sister Sophie Hedwig. Christian and Christiana had eleven children: *Magdalene Sophie (b. Dresden, 19 October 1651 - d. Merseburg, 29 March 1675). *Johann Georg (b. Merseburg, 4 December 1652 - d.

The agreement was finalized after three months of talks by the Zionist Federation of Germany, the Anglo-Palestine Bank (under the directive of the Jewish Agency) and the economic authorities of Nazi Germany. It was a major factor in making possible the migration of approximately 60,000 German Jews to Palestine in 1933‚Äì1939. The agreement enabled Jews fleeing persecution under the new Nazi regime to transfer some portion of their assets to British Mandatory Palestine.Kr√ºger, C. G (2009). The English Historical Review 124 (510). Oxford University Press: 1208‚Äì10. https://www.jstor.org/stable/40270563.

The agreement was controversial and was criticised by many Jewish leaders both within the Zionist movement (such as the Revisionist Zionist leader Ze'ev Jabotinsky) and outside it, as well as by members of the NSDAP and members of the German public. For German Jews, the agreement offered a way to leave an increasingly hostile environment in Germany; for the Yishuv, the new Jewish community in Palestine, it offered access to both immigrant labor and economic support; for the Germans it facilitated the emigration of German Jews while breaking the anti-Nazi boycott of 1933, which had mass support among European Jews and was thought by the German state to be a potential threat to the German economy.Francis R. Nicosia The Third Reich & the Palestine question, pp. 41-49. Background Although the NSDAP won the greatest share of the popular vote in the two Reichstag general elections of 1932, they did not have a majority, so Hitler led a short-lived coalition government formed by the NSDAP and the German National People's Party. Under pressure from politicians, industrialists and others, President Paul von Hindenburg appointed Hitler as Chancellor of Germany on 30 January 1933. This event is known as the Machtergreifung (seizure of power). In the following months, the NSDAP used a process termed Gleichschaltung (co- ordination) to consolidate power. By June 1933, virtually the only organisations not under the control of the NSDAP were the army and the churches. Within the Nazi movement, a variety of (increasingly radical) \\"solutions\\" to the \\"Jewish Question\\" were proposed both before and after the NSDAP was in government, including expulsion and the encouragement of voluntary emigration. Widespread civil persecution of German Jews began as soon as the NSDAP was in power. Full text For example, on 1 April, the NSDAP organized a nationwide boycott of Jewish-owned businesses in Germany; under the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service which was implemented on 7 April, Jews were excluded from the civil service; on 25 April, quotas were imposed on the number of Jews in schools and universities. Jews outside Germany responded to these persecutions with a boycott of German goods. Meanwhile, in Mandatory Palestine, a growing Jewish population (174,610 in 1931, rising to 384,078 in 1936) was acquiring land and developing the structures of a future Jewish state despite opposition from the Arab population. Hanotea company Transfer agreement used by the Pal√§stina Treuhandstelle (Palestine Trustee OfficeJewish Responses to Persecution: 1933-1938, J√ºrgen Matth√§us, Mark Roseman, Rowman & Littlefield, 2010), established specifically to assist Jews fleeing the Nazi regime to recover some portion of the assets they had been forced to surrender when they fled Nazi Germany. Hanotea (, \\"the Planter\\") was a citrus planting company based in Netanya and established in 1929 by long-established Jewish settlers in Palestine involved in the Benei Binyamin movement.Nahum Karlinsky California Dreaming: Ideology, Society, and Technology in the Citrus Industry of Palestine, 1890-1939 SUNY Press, pp.76-8, 118, 218 In a deal worked out with the Reich Economics Ministry, the blocked German bank accounts of prospective immigrants would be unblocked and funds from them used by Hanotea to buy agricultural German goods; these goods, along with the immigrants, would then be shipped to Palestine, and the immigrants would be granted a house or citrus plantation by the company to the same value.Rafael N. Rosenzweig The Economic Consequences of Zionism, New York: BRILL, 1989, pp.82-83 Hanotea's director, Sam Cohen, represented the company in direct negotiation with the Reich Economics Ministry beginning in March 1933.Francis R. Nicosia: The third Reich & the Palestine question, p. 39 ff. In May 1933 Hanotea applied for permission to transfer capital from Germany to Palestine. This pilot arrangement appeared to be operating successfully, and so paved the way for the later Haavara Agreement. The transfer agreement The Haavara (Transfer) Agreement, negotiated by Eliezer Hoofein, director of the Anglo-Palestine Bank,Leni Yahil, The Holocaust: The Fate of European Jewry, 1932-1945, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1991, p.101 was agreed to by the Reich Economics Ministry in 1933, and continued, with declining German government support, until it was wound up in 1939. Under the agreement, Jews emigrating from Germany could use their assets to purchase German-manufactured goods for export, thus salvaging their personal assets during emigration. The agreement provided a substantial export market for German factories in British-ruled Palestine. Between November, 1933, and 31 December 1937, 77,800,000 Reichmarks, or $22,500,000, (values in 1938 currency) worth of goods were exported to Jewish businesses in Palestine under the program. By the time the program ended with the start of World War II, the total had risen to 105,000,000 marks (about $35,000,000, 1939 values). Emigrants with capital of ¬£1,000, (about $5,000 in 1930s currency value) could move to Palestine in spite of severe British restrictions on Jewish immigration under an immigrant investor program similar to the modern EB-5 visa. Under the Transfer Agreement, about 39% of an emigrant's funds were given to Jewish communal economic development projects, leaving individuals with about 43% of the funds.Heritage: Civilization and the Jews (PBS) The Haavara Agreement was thought among some German circles to be a possible way to solve the \\"Jewish problem.\\" The head of the Middle Eastern division of the foreign ministry, the anti-NSDAP politician Werner Otto von Hentig, supported the policy of settling Jews in Palestine. Hentig believed that if the Jewish population was concentrated in a single foreign entity, then foreign diplomatic policy and containment of the Jews would become easier.Francis R. Nicosia The Third Reich & the Palestine question, pp. 132‚Äì133. Hitler's own support of the Haavara Agreement was unclear and varied throughout the 1930s. Initially, Hitler seemed indifferent to the economic details of the plan, but he supported it in the period from September 1937 to 1939.Francis R. Nicosia: The Third Reich & the Palestine question, pp. 140, 142. After the German invasion of Poland in September 1939 the program was ended. Responses The agreement was controversial both within the NSDAP and in the Zionist movement. As historian Edwin Black put it, \\"The Transfer Agreement tore the Jewish world apart, turning leader against leader, threatening rebellion and even assassination.\\"Edwin Black \\"COULD WE HAVE STOPPED HITLER? Could American Jews have acted sooner and done more to save European\\" Reform Judaism Fall 1999 Opposition came in particular from the mainstream US leadership of the World Zionist Congress, in particular Abba Hillel Silver and American Jewish Congress president Rabbi Stephen Wise.Aaron Berman Nazism, the Jews and American Zionism, 1933-1988, Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1992, p.39; Jennifer Ring, Political Consequences of Thinking, The: Gender and Judaism in the Work of Hannah Arendt, New York: SUNY Press, 1 Feb 2012, pp.59-63 Wise and other leaders of the Anti-Nazi boycott of 1933 argued against the agreement, narrowly failing to persuade the Nineteenth Zionist Congress in August 1935 to vote against it. The right-wing Revisionist Zionists and their leader Vladimir Jabotinsky were even more vocal in their opposition.Francis R. Nicosia Zionism and Anti-Semitism in Nazi Germany Cambridge University Press, 5 May 2008, p.99 The Revisionist newspaper in Palestine, Hazit Haam published a sharp denunciation of those involved in the agreement as \\"betrayers\\", and shortly afterwards one of the negotiators, Haim Arlosoroff was assassinated.

It tells the tale of a na√Øve young knight who wins the hand of a maiden after a magical adventure. Composition and manuscripts The actual date of composition is estimated around the beginning of the 13th century. The lai of Tyolet is contained in one existing manuscript: Paris, Biblioth√®que Nationale de France, nouv. acq. fr. 1104, f. 15v, col. 1. This manuscript dates from the end of the 13th or beginning of the 14th century. The text is written in Francien with some Norman and Picard influences. Synopsis Tyolet tells the story of a young man who lives in the forest with his widowed mother. Thanks to powers granted to him by a fairy when he was a child, he can summon animals only by whistling. This ability is very useful, as it enables him to put food on the table. One day out in the forest, Tyolet sees a stag and whistles so that it will approach. However, it does not come, so he follows it. They come to a river where Tyolet sees another deer. The stag crosses the water, so instead Tyolet summons the second deer and kills it. Meanwhile, the stag across the river has transformed into a knight on horseback. Astounded, Tyolet begins to ask the knight rather na√Øve questions regarding his weapons and armor. Having been sheltered his entire life, Tyolet has never seen a knight and thinks it is a wild animal. He addresses the knight as \\"knight beast\\" (Old French chevalier beste)), a name which he later applies to himself. The knight answers all of Tyolet's questions and tells him to return to his mother who will present him with his father's armor. This happens exactly as the knight says, and Tyolet sets out for King Arthur's castle. Once there, Arthur invites Tyolet to dinner, but a maiden dressed in white enters into the hall. She announces that she is the daughter of the king of Logres, and she has come to court to find a husband. She is followed by a white hound. She tells the court that whoever chooses to follow the white hound will find a white stag guarded by seven lions. If the knight is able to bring back the stag's foot, she will marry him. Many knights attempt this feat, but they are all stopped at a perilous river that they fear to cross in spite of the hound. Unlike the others, however, Tyolet follows the hound all the way to the stag. He whistles, and when the stag approaches, he cuts off its foot. The lions then attack Tyolet, but he fends them off. At this point, a knight arrives on the scene. Tyolet tells his story to the stranger who then duels Tyolet. Exhausted from fighting the lions, Tyolet is unable to defeat the knight; and the knight leaves him for dead, taking the foot of the stag with him back to court. Back at court, the knights and the maiden are suspicious of the newcomer and wait a week for the hound to return. He eventually does, and it leads Sir Gauvain back to the body of Tyolet. Gauvain calls for a doctor and returns to court. Healed, Tyolet arrives shortly afterwards. When asked, the knight continues to declare that he is the rightful claimant, but he is eventually forced to reveal the truth when he admits that he did not kill the lions or cut off the stag's foot. He begs forgiveness of Tyolet, who grants it. Tyolet and the maiden marry and live happily ever after. Analysis and significance =Structure= The poem can be broken down into the following sections: # Prologue (vv. 1-36) # Tyolet in the forest (vv. 37-274) # Tyolet at the court of King Arthur (vv. 275-364) # The knights undertake the task (vv. 365-410) # Tyolet's adventure (vv. 411-488) # The imposter goes to court (vv. 489-574) # Gauvain finds Tyolet who returns (vv.575-692) # Tyolet marries the princess (vv. 693-703) # Epilogue (v. 704) =Allusions= The beginning of this lai shares many elements with Chr√©tien de Troyes' Le Conte du Graal. Tyolet's childhood with his widowed mother in the forest mimics that of Perceval. Like Tyolet, Perceval has been sheltered from civilization and stumbles upon a knight. While Tyolet mistakes the knight for a beast, Perceval mistakes it for an angel. Both heroes ask for a detailed explanation of all the knight's armor, and both heroes desire nothing more than to become a knight themselves. They both then go to King Arthur's court. A connection also exists between Tyolet and the second continuation to Perceval by Wauchier de Denain. In this episode, Perceval tries to win the love of a lady by following a white hound and cutting off the head of a white stag.Burgess 58 Several lais feature knights that transform into animals. In Marie de France's Bisclavret and the anonymous Melion, a knight turns into a werewolf; in Marie's Yonec, a knight turns into a hawk. Tests to prove prowess and win a maiden's hand are also common in lais, such as Doon and Les Deux Amants. The ability to summon an animal by whistling is a trait associated with the character Auberon in the medieval Huon de Bordeaux. =Symbolism= The forest can represent the uncivilized world or the world far from the court. It also symbolizes femininity.Burgess 69 The color white appears many times in the text and can symbolize the purity of the maiden and her future union with Tyolet: the white horse, the white hound, the white stag, the paleness of the lady.

Children can be found in almost any economic sector. However, at a global level, most of them work in agriculture (70%). Approximately 2.4 million adolescents aged 16 to 17 years worked in the U.S. in 2006.Bureau of Labor Statistics [2007]. Employment and Earnings, Annual Averages, Table 15. Employed persons in agriculture and related and in nonagricultural industries by age, sex, and class of worker Data source: Current Population Survey. Official employment statistics are not available for younger adolescents who are also known to work, especially in agricultural settings. In 2006, 30 youth under 18 died from work-related injuries in the U.S.Bureau of Labor Statistics [2007]. National Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries in 2006. Washington, DC: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, USDL 07-1202. In 2003, an estimated 54,800 work-related injuries and illnesses among youth less than 18 years of age were treated in hospital emergency departments. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health reports that only one-third of work-related injuries are seen in emergency departments, therefore it is likely that approximately 160,000 youth sustain work-related injuries and illnesses each year. The highest number of teen worker fatalities occur in agricultural work and the retail trades, according to recent data. Across Europe, 18- to 24-year-olds are at least 50% more likely to be injured in the workplace than more experienced workers. Number and distribution of fatal occupational injuries by age among young workers, 1992‚Äì2002 BLS 2003 Work that poses special risks for young workers A young worker describing a severe occupational injury Because of their biologic, social, and economic characteristics, young workers have unique and substantial risks for work-related injuries and illnesses. Besides retail and agriculture, other areas of high risk for work-related injuries include construction and work activities involving motor vehicles and mobile machinery. Although safety requirements and child labor laws prohibit or restrict teen employment in certain kinds of industries and occupations, young workers may yet face risks on the job because an employer or a young employee may not be aware of applicable laws and may not be aware that a hazard exists, because the young employee may lack experience, or because there is inadequate training or supervision. Child labor is the employment of children under an age determined by law or custom. This practice is considered exploitative by many countries and international organizations. Child labor was utilized to varying extents through most of history, but entered public dispute with the beginning of universal schooling, with changes in working conditions during industrialization, and with the emergence of the concepts of workers' and children's rights. Child labor is still common in some places. Even after passing child labor legislation, developing countries in particular still feature informal economies made up of child workers who are more exposed to human rights violations in the workplace. =Work in agriculture= There are roughly 250,000 children who work on U.S. farms, that do not live on the farm, and another 30 million children who visit farms annually. About every three days a child dies on a U.S. farm. In 2004, most youth work fatalities occurred in the agriculture sector. About two thirds of these fatalities could be attributed to transportation accidents. According to the \\"Occupational injuries among young workers\\" report, most of these transportation accidents occurred either by truck or by tractor. Tractor accidents alone counted for 1/4 of the youth worker fatalities from 1993 to 2002. For workers 13 years old and younger, agricultural fatalities accounted for 42 out of the 49 total fatalities for that age group between 1998 and 2002. There are fewer child labor restrictions on family-owned or operated farms; workers as young as 13 can legally operate tractors on farms if their family owns it or operates it. Experiences and exposures across different sectors of agriculture vary greatly. For example, children who worked on tobacco farms experienced a number of negative health effects including nausea, heat exhaustion, and burning eyes. =Work in construction= Between the years 1998 and 2002, construction accidents accounted for 18% of youth worker fatalities, making construction the second most deadly industry for a young worker to be employed in during that time period. A significant number of young worker fatalities in this sector resulted from work that the young worker was not legally authorized to do. For example, 16-year-old workers accounted for almost 20% of the young worker fatalities in the construction sector between 1998 and 2002, even though workers 16 and younger are legally unauthorized to enter a construction site; if they do work for the construction industry, they can only work in an office or sales department. Additionally, Hispanic and Latino young workers made up 35% of the young worker fatalities in the construction sector. Hispanics make up 14.4% of the United States' general population. =Work in retail trades= The second highest number of workplace fatalities between 1993 and 1997 among workers younger than age 18 occurred in the retail trades (e.g., restaurants and retail stores). Between 1992 and 2000, 63% of these deaths were due to assaults and violent acts, most of which were homicides. Homicide associated with robbery is the probable cause for one fourth to one half of all young worker fatalities in retail trades.Windau J, Sygnatur E, Toscano G [1999]. Profile of work injuries incurred by young workers. Monthly Labor Review, June 1999. Handling cash, working alone or in small numbers, and working in the late evening and early morning hours may contribute to workplace homicides [NIOSH 1996a].NIOSH [1996a].

Cincinnati, OH: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, DHHS (NIOSH) Publication No. 96‚Äì100. In 1998, more than half of all work-related nonfatal injuries to young workers occurred in retail trades, more than 60% of which were eating and drinking establishments. Cuts in retail trades were the most common type of injury treated in emergency departments, followed by burns in eating and drinking establishments and bruises, scrapes, and scratches in other retail settings.Mardis AL, Pratt SG [2003]. Nonfatal injuries to young workers in the retail trades and service industries in 1998. J Occup Environ Med 45(3):316‚Äì323. Common hazards in restaurants include using knives to prepare food, handling hot grease from fryers, working near hot surfaces, and slipping on wet or greasy floors.NRC/IOM (National Research Council, Institute of Medicine) [1998]. Protecting youth at work: health, safety, and development of working children and adolescents in the United States. Washington, DC: National Academy Press. In addition, certain types of machinery prohibited for use by young workers under current child labor laws are commonly found in retail establishments‚Äîincluding food slicers, paper balers, forklifts, dough and batter mixers, and bread cutting machines. Young workers may choose to operate unfamiliar machinery to prove responsibility, independence, or maturity,Massachusetts Department of Public Health [1998]. Work-related injuries to teens.

Boston, MA: Occupational Health Surveillance Program. or they may be instructed to do so by an employer who is unaware of child labor laws or chooses to disregard them. U.S. federal and state programs =OSHA= The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) within the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) is the Federal agency with primary responsibility for setting and enforcing standards to promote safe and healthful working conditions for all workers. Employers are responsible for becoming familiar with standards applicable to their establishments and for ensuring a safe working environment. = U.S. Public Health Service = The U.S. Public Health Service has a Healthy People 2020 objective to reduce emergency department injury rates among young workers, ages 15 through 19, to 4.9 injuries/100 full-time equivalents by 2020. The rate in 2007 was 5.3 injuries/100 full-time equivalents. =NIOSH= The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) within the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention plays a lead role in efforts to reduce injuries and illnesses among working youth by conducting and supporting science to guide prevention efforts, disseminating findings, and working with others in collaborative outreach. The NIOSH funds the National Children's Center for Rural and Agricultural Health and Safety. =Federal child labor laws= A workplace may be fully compliant with OSHA regulations and yet may place young workers at risk of injury or illness if applicable federal and state child labor laws are not followed. One study estimated that more than three-fourths of employers of young workers were unfamiliar with child labor laws. Lack of awareness of occupational safety and health laws by young workers, adults, and employers has been identified as a major obstacle to preventing injury and illness in young workers. The primary Federal law governing the employment of workers under age 18 is the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) of 1938, which is enforced by the Wage and Hour Division of the Employment Standards Administration within DOL. Child labor provisions of the FLSA are designed to protect the educational opportunities of minors and prohibit their employment in jobs that pose safety or health risks. The FLSA does not cover all young workers. The FLSA applies to an entire business enterprise if the enterprise has annual gross revenues of $500,000 or more. Child Labor Regulation No. 3 restricts hours and specifies allowable employment activities for workers aged 14 and 15. =State child labor laws= States may also have their own child labor laws that are stricter than federal laws. If a state child labor law is less protective than federal law, or if no applicable state law exists, Federal child labor laws apply.

The palace and the garden were built between 1700 and 1707 by the Italian architect Domenico Egidio Rossi for Margrave Louis William of Baden-Baden. Visitors can tour the restored Baroque interior and gardens. History The Prunksaal in 2005 During the Palatine war of succession, the residence of Margrave Louis William of Baden-Baden had been burnt by French troops. A rebuild of the destroyed building would not have suited the representative needs of the court of Baden- Baden. Since he also needed a home for his wife Sibylle Auguste of Saxe- Lauenburg, whom he had married in 1690, the Margrave had a new residence built in place of the former hunting lodge. During this operation, the 1697 hunting lodge was demolished to leave space for the new palace. The village of Rastatt was promoted to city status in 1700, and the Margrave moved there with his court. The residence in Rastatt is the oldest Baroque residence in the German Upper-Rhine area. It was built according to the example of the French Palace of Versailles. During the 19th century, the palace was used as a headquarters. The palace was not damaged during World War II. It is now owned by the State of Baden-W√ºrttemberg, and visitors can take guided tours of the restored rooms and Baroque gardens. The palace is also home to two museums, the \\"Wehrgeschichtliches Museum\\" (military history museum) and the \\"Erinnerungsst√§tte f√ºr die Freiheitsbewegungen in der deutschen Geschichte\\" (memorial site for the German liberation movement).

He sold retail goods and then wholesale goods to the federal government from New York City during the American Civil War. With his wife Eliza Tibbets, he was known for growing the first two Washington Navel orange trees (from grafts) in Riverside, California about 1875. Their success and the qualities of the fruit resulted in a conversion of citrus orchards to this variety and rapid expansion of the California citrus industry. Early life and education Luther C. Tibbets was born in South Berwick, York County, Maine, to a farming family. He learned about many aspects of farming as a boy and had some education in local schools. He started clerking at local stores. Work Tibbets began working in the mercantile grocery business. During the American Civil War, while based in New York City, he was successfully involved in wholesale grain and cereal dealing with the federal government. He said he refused to become involved in corrupt operations, and could not compete with rivals, who drew off most of his business. In 1863, he began a relationship with Eliza Lovell Reveal, but they did not marry for several years. After the Civil War and a short period in Tennessee, the couple relocated in 1867 to Fredericksburg, Virginia, where he had a store. He identified as a Radical Republican and complained in affidavits to the military Reconstruction government about treatment by local businessmen and courts. White Southerners were hostile to those they considered carpetbaggers and the couple suffered persecution. Tibbets was litigious while in business the post-United States Civil War southern states. Tibbets was involved in a number of lawsuits and complained of threats purportedly by Ku Klux Klan members. He gave law enforcement letters which he said had been delivered to him, threatening KKK action unless he left town. In 1867, Tibbets proposed a development plan for what he called a colony near Fredericksburg of about 30,000 acres, believing plantations and other properties could be subdivided into portions of a variety of sizes, to include 100 farms of 100 acres each, with increasingly smaller farms closer to the village, which would have residential lots. He planned also to provide 'cabins' for Negroes, barns, sheds and outbuildings, and to sell land to anyone of any race, acting as the land agent or broker for the development. He floated this proposal in Philadelphia, New York, and Boston, and had preliminary discussions with an Isaac L. Platt, a businessman from New York who went to Virginia to meet him and look at property. The project became very confused and litigated, with sons of Platt saying he was incapable of making the business transaction and suing for the 3500 dollars which he had paid Tibbets by check. The deal was cancelled at last. Under pressure, Tibbets and his extended family left Fredericksburg in September 1868. Tibbets and Eliza moved with their family to Washington, DC, for a few years. He led the way to California, moving in 1870 and becoming one of the early pioneers in Riverside. Tibbets died in 1902, and is buried with his wife Eliza at the Evergreen Memorial Park and Cemetery in Riverside.\\"Founders' Stories: Luther C Tibbets\\" , Evergreen Memorial Historic Cemetery Navel orange introduction In 1873 Eliza Tibbets received two new grafted orange trees to grow and test, from the botanist William Saunders, the Director of the new U.S. Department of Agriculture in Washington, D.C.\\"Founders' Stories: Eliza Tibbets\\" , Evergreen Memorial Historic Cemetery He had ordered the original cuttings from Bahia, Brazil. The seedless Washington Navel oranges became very popular, and growers requested graft stock from the Tibbets. As a hybrid, this is the only way the orange can be propagated. The Tibbets sold buds for grafts at a \\"reasonable price\\" to fellow growers, not wanting to profit from the government's gift. Marriage and family Tibbets was married twice before Eliza and had a total of five children, including Harriet, Francis J., Joanna F., Luther Calvin, Jr. and Minnie Tibbets. Harriet married Eliza's son, James B. Summons, from her first marriage. The two couples and some of Luther's children, including Francis, moved to Fredericksburg, Virginia, for a couple of years after the Civil War. Tibbets owned and ran a store there with Summons. In California, they raised a granddaughter, child of Harriet and James Summons, who was killed in a drowning accident in 1878, the same year the senior couple had to declare bankruptcy.

History In the reign of Richard II (1377‚Äì1399) a king's licence was awarded to Baldwin de Radyngton in 1398 to found a chantry in Enfield at St Andrews parish church, endowed with lands to the value of ¬£10 per annum. Part of this endowment consisted of lands in Enfield and Radington Bridge. Robert Blossom of South Benfleet, Essex, who died in 1418 (in the time of Henry V, 1413‚Äì22), left his estate called Poynetts to support a chantry at South Benfleet for three years. His widow Agnes came to reside at Enfield and remarried, and the estate was put into Trust, with Lord Tiptoft as Trustee. After Agnes died, her second husband, John Hulfield, remarried, and when he died his widow married William Daubeney. In 1455 Lord Tiptoft conveyed the Trust to him. Within two years it had passed to one Richard Ingleton, and in 1471 he received a licence from Edward IV to endow a chantry at Enfield church with proceeds from the same estate, to the value of 10 marks.J. Tuff, Historical, Topographical and Statistical Notices of Enfield (Enfield Public Library/J.H. Meyers, 1858), pp. 129-30. It is recorded that there was a schoolmaster at Enfield before 1524, since one is mentioned in connection with the funeral in that year of Sir Thomas Lovell of Elsing.L.B. Marshall, A Brief History of Enfield Grammar School 1558-1958 (Dimbleby & Sons, 1958). It is most likely that this man was educating boys as part of the work of the chantry. Following the dissolution of Chantries in the first year of Edward VI, the Blossom's Chantry endowment lands were taken by the Court of Augmentations for the Crown and sold, with many other lands: but in 1550 the money was repaid to the purchasers and the lands recovered by the Court, on the grounds that the King's title in them was not secure. In 1553 Queen Mary relinquished the Crown interest in them. In January 1558, at the first, uncompleted attempt to found the Enfield Free Grammar School, the whole estates were granted or intended to be conveyed for the endowment of the new school. One of the Trustees having died soon afterwards, before that deed could be completed, a second foundation deed was drawn up in May 1558, by which only a part of the rents from these estates was granted towards the school, the remainder of the proceeds being assigned to the poor of Enfield.Tuff, Notices of Enfield, pp. 130-133.'Schools: Enfield Grammar School', in J.S. Cockburn, H.P.F. King and K.G.T. McDonnell (eds), A History of the County of Middlesex, Vol. 1: Physique, Archaeology, Domesday, Ecclesiastical Organization, the Jews, Religious Houses, Education of Working Classes To 1870, Private Education From Sixteenth Century, Victoria County History (HMSO, London 1969), pp. 294-96 (British History Online, accessed 30 May 2017). The amount granted in May 1558, ¬£6 13s. 4d. (equivalent to 10 marks), was the same sum which had formerly been paid as the stipend of the chantry priest. An older school-house certainly still existed east of the churchyard in 1572. It therefore appears likely that this had been used for the chantry-school, and that its reformed activities were continued there under the new Grammar School foundation and endowment until new buildings were constructed under the William Garrett bequest of 1586.Will of William Garrett, Merchant Taylor of London (P.C.C. 1586).

The most popular motifs are leaves and flowers. Malaysian batik depicting humans or animals are rare because Islam norms forbid animal images as decoration. However, the butterfly theme is a common exception. The Malaysian batik is also famous for its geometrical designs, such as spirals. The method of Malaysian batik making is also quite different from those of Indonesian Javanese batik, the pattern is larger and simpler, it seldom or never uses canting to create intricate patterns and rely heavily on brush painting method to apply colours on fabrics. The colours also tend to be lighter and more vibrant than deep coloured Javanese batik. In line with the Malaysia concept, the Malaysian government is now endorsing Malaysian batik as a national dress to every level of the general population, by having local designers to create new batik designs which reflect the Malaysia idea.Malaysia Activities At State Level Throughout Next Year Bernama.com, accessed 4 December 2009 History The drawing of Malaysian batik. The origin of batik production in Malaysia it is known trade relations between the Melayu Kingdom in Jambi and Javanese coastal cities have thrived since the 13th century, the northern coastal batik producing areas of Java (Cirebon, Lasem, Tuban, and Madura) has influenced Jambi batik. This Jambi (Sumatran) batik, as well as Javanese batik, has influenced the batik craft in the Malay peninsula.National Geographic Traveller Indonesia, Vol 1, No 6, 2009, Jakarta, Indonesia, page 54 According to the Museum of Cultural History of Oslo, it is known for certain that the Javanese influenced Malay batik-making technically as well as in the development of designs. At an early stage the Malaysians used wooden blocks in order to produce batik-like textiles. As late as the 1920s Javanese batik makers introduced the use of wax and copper blocks on Malaysia's east coast. The production of hand drawn batik in Malaysia is of recent date and is related to the Javanese batik tulis. Commercial production started in the 1960s. This craft has developed its own particular aesthetic and design, peculiar to Malaysia. The new Malaysian batik is clearly different from the Javanese tradition of hand-painted batiks.Malaysia - Batikktradisjoner i bevegelse Malaysian batik can be found on the east coast of Malaysia such as Kelantan, Terengganu and Pahang, while batik in Johor clearly shows Javanese and Sumatran influences since there are a large number of Javanese and Sumatran immigrants in southern Malaysia. Culture A Batik shop in Malaysia selling a variety of Malaysian batik. Batik was mentioned in the 17th century Malay Annals. The legend goes when Laksamana Hang Nadim was ordered by Sultan Mahmud to sail to India to get 140 pieces of serasah cloth (batik) with 40 types of flowers depicted on each. Unable to find any that fulfilled the requirements explained to him, he made up his own. On his return unfortunately, his ship sank and he only managed to bring four pieces, earning displeasure from the Sultan. For men, Batik can be worn at dinner functions. Even the ladies wear the fabric as formal dress, combining batik with modern fashion. The Malaysian government encourages civil servants to wear batik during the 1st and 15th day of the month. In Sabah, East Malaysia, teachers are encouraged to wear batik shirts or baju kurung to school on Thursdays - usually the school will have a particular patterned fabric which will be provided to every teacher to take to the tailor, so that their clothing matches.

The communists later responded with the first counter-encirclement campaign at Central Soviet (), also called by the communists as the first counter-encirclement campaign at Central Revolutionary Base (), in which the Red Army successfully defended the Soviet Republic in the southern Jiangxi province against Nationalist attacks from November 1930 to January 3, 1931. Prelude The planning of the campaign was already in process in mid August 1930, as Chiang Kai-shek had directed He Yingqing, the commander of Wuhan headquarters, to hold a conference at Hankou on how to suppress the communists in Hunan, Hubei and Jiangxi provinces. A decision was made to concentrate on military rather than political strategies, and to launch multiple attacks on the main communist base in Jiangxi Soviet. The plan was temporarily interrupted by the Central Plains War, but when Chiang's victory in this theatre was certain by October 1930, he immediately redeployed his troops in preparation for engaging the communists. =Nationalist strategy planned for the 1st phase= Chiang Kai- shek appointed the nationalist Jiangxi provincial governor and commander of the 9th Route Army, Lu Diping to organize the nationalist troops for redeployment. On November 2, 1930, Lu Diping mobilized the nationalist troops, totalling 7 divisions and 1 brigade into 3 columns, with reinforcements in the form of Chiang Kai-shek's troops from Hunan. The 19th Route Army departed from Wuhan by October 20, 1930. Lu Diping set a deadline of November 5, 1930, by which time the nationalist troops were to reach their designated deployment areas.

In numerous debates, many supported the strategy of using the majority of the 40,000 strong Chinese Red Army to strike Nanchang and Jiujiang, in order to force the nationalists onto the defensive, thus abandoning the encirclement campaign. However, the general commissar of the Chinese Red Army, Mao Zedong opposed the idea, arguing that the numerically and technically inferior communist army was in no position to conduct an ambitious invasion into nationalist territory. Instead, it was decided that the communists should fight the enemy within Jiangxi Soviet itself, with the hope that the native population would support them. Mao Zedong finally prevailed and on October 30, 1930, at the Luofang Conference, it was agreed that the Chinese Red Army should cross the Gan River and defeat the enemy on the eastern shore. First phase Zhu De, the commander-in-chief of the Chinese Red Army, led the 3rd Legion, together with Mao. The 4th Army and the 12th Army of the 1st Legion crossed the Gan River, moving eastward to Xingan, Eternal Abundance, Chongren, and Yihuang, allowing the nationalists to occupy Qingjiang, Xingquan, Yellow Earth Street, Luofang, Xinyu, and Fenyi by early November 1930. Only the 3rd Army of the Chinese Red Army remained in the former communist region to harass the enemy, using guerrilla warfare, while Mao and Zhu De moved their troops toward Zhangshu and Linchuan. Fearing Zhangshu and Linchuan would be lost to the communists, Lu Diping ordered the 3rd Column to continue the attack on the western shore of Gan River, while the 1st and the 2nd Columns crossed the Gan River in pursuit of the major communist force. After crossing the Gan, the nationalists succeeded in taking Xingquan, Chongren, Southern Town, Southern Abundance, Jishui, Lukou, Oil Field, Donggu and Dragon Hill by mid November 1930. From November 18‚Äì20, the nationalists took Ji'an, Jishui, Eternal Abundance, Yuean, Yihuang and Southern Town. By early December, the nationalist force was overstretched and halted their offensives to regroup and re-supply. Meanwhile, the communists planned their next move and also regrouped and re-supplied, first at Yellow Slope, Little Cloth and Luokou, and then moved to Pingtian, Firewood Gathering Hill, and Anfuyu by mid December. At the same time, the 20th Army of the Chinese Red Army acted as decoy in the Rich Field, Donggu and Dragon Hill regions to distract the enemy. A Communist counter-attack defeated the Nationalist force and drove them back. A stalemate ensued, with both sides using this period to plan and prepare for the next phase. =Kuomintang strategy planned for the second phase= Chiang Kai-shek reached Nanchang in early December 1930. He took the command and ordered the nationalist forces to attack Donggu in mid December. More nationalist troops were mobilized, with the 19th Route Army from Wuhan joining the battle, and the 49th Division, 56th Division and 2nd Independent Brigade attacking from Fujian. The nationalist forces by then had been boosted to a total of 11 divisions and two brigades, totalling more than 100,000 men. Lu Diping was named as Chiang's deputy, while Zhang Huizan, the commander of the 18th Division, was promoted to front line commander-in-chief. The Kuomintang troops slowly began their push towards their objectives. Order of battle (nationalists) *77th Division attacking Anfu from Ji'an *49th Division and the 2nd Independent Brigade attacking Ruijin, Huichang *34th brigade of the 12th Division defending Ganzhou *The 6th Route Army: **8th Division attacking Guangchan, Ningdu, Yudu from Yellow Slope and Southern Abundance **24th Division attacking Dongshao, Luokou, and Ningdu from Chinese Alligator Lake **56th Division attacking Stone City from Jianning *The 9th Route Army: **5th Division attacking Rich Field, Donggu from Ji'an **18th Division attacking Ancient County, White Sand and Donggu from Eternal Abundance **50th Division attacking Shaoxie, Tengtian, Dragon Hill and Donggu from Yuean *The 19th Route Army: **60th Division attacking Wanan from Pingxiang, Jiangxi **61st Division attacking Taihe from Pingxiang, Jiangxi =Communist strategy planned for the 2nd phase= The communists held a conference at Yellow Slope of Ningdu county in mid December 1930 to discuss their next move. Because of the inferiority in equipment suffered by the communists, Mao decided to concentrate his troops together, hoping to outnumber opposing forces during engagements. Smaller local communist forces would take advantage of the landscape to engage in guerilla warfare, in order to slow down enemy units and prevent them from linking up and reinforcing. Mao's idea was accepted, and the 35th Division of the 12th Army of the Chinese Red Army was sent to the Yue Creek region northeast of Xingguo county to distract the enemy, while the main force was concentrated at Yellow Slope and Matian in preparation for the coming battle. Second phase The stalemate ended on December 16, 1930, when the nationalists began the 2nd phase of their offensive. The 5th Division (later renamed the 28th Division) and the 18th Division reached Donggu on December 19 and December 20 respectively. However, heavy fog and poor communication prevented adequate coordination between the nationalist forces and the divisions mistook one another for the enemy, with both using artillery against the other. It was not until December 21 when the fog dissipated that the nationalists realized their mistakes, and by this time both sides had suffered hundreds of casualties. From December 24‚Äì28, the communist forces managed to halt most of the nationalist advance: *The nationalist 50th Division was stopped at Zhaoxie *The nationalist 60th Division was stopped at Wangan *The nationalist 61st Division was stopped at Taihe *The nationalist 24th Division was stopped at Caotaigang *The nationalist 8th Division was stopped at New Abundance *The nationalist 28th Division (renamed 5th Division) was stopped at Triple Craters *The nationalist 18th Division was stopped at regions near Yinfu and Nanlong After the initial setback, the nationalist 50th Division continued their push, reaching River Origin, and prepared to take Little Cloth. Realising this, the communists attempted an ambush of the nationalist 50th Division twice, once on December 25, and again two days later. Both attempts failed ‚Äì the nationalist troops refused to be drawn from their fortified positions on River Origin. The communists were forced to withdraw. Third phase On December 28, 1930, Lu Diping ordered the five nationalist divisions within the heart of Jiangxi Soviet to launch a general offensive toward the Yellow Slope, Little Cloth and Matian regions north of Ningdu. The nationalist 18th Division, under the command of Zhang Huizan, pushed toward Dragon Hill from Donggu. The communists attempted to incite local militia to stop the nationalist 50th Division at River Origin, the nationalist 24th Division at Luokou and the nationalist 8th Division at Head Slope, with the main force engaging the 18th Division. On December 29, as the Chinese Red Army was on its way, the news of the fall of Dragon Hill to the nationalist 18th Division reached the communists. They devised a plan to trap the advancing nationalists with a pincer manoeuvre. Fourth phase On the morning of December 30, 1930, the 18th Division of the nationalist 9th Route Army began their push toward Five Gates Ridge from Dragon Hill, headed by the 52nd brigade. Around 09:00, the most important battle of the first counter-encirclement campaign began at Short Separation, east of Dragon Hill, with elements of the Chinese Red Army firing the first shot. =The first major battle= By noon of December 30, the entire 3rd Legion of the Chinese Red Army was engaged in the battle. Zhang Huizan, the commander of nationalist 18th Division, only devoted two more regiments in support of his 52nd brigade, under the mistaken belief that the enemy forces he had encountered were merely guerillas. By 15:00, Zhang Huizan was leading the charge of four regiments to clear the communist resistance, but was driven back. Taking advantage of this, the 4th Army and part of the 3rd Legion of the Chinese Red Army moved to cut off the nationalist 18th Division from Donggu and Yinfu, attacking Dragon Hill from behind. The majority of the 3rd Legion of the Chinese Red Army took Shanggu, cutting off the escape route of the nationalist 18th Division at Dragon Hill, and preventing any nationalist reinforcement from the north-west. Realising they were trapped, morale amongst the nationalist ranks plummeted as they attempted an escape. By 16:00, the encirclement of the nationalist 18th Division was complete and the nationalist attempt to escape toward the north-west had been beaten back. The nationalist army quickly became disorganised, and by this point Zhang Huizan had insufficient control of his forces to arrange an orderly retreat or muster any counter-attack. He was eventually taken prisoner by the communist forces. By 18:00 the battle was over, the entire nationalist division having been wiped out. Consequences The complete destruction of the 18th Division of the nationalist 9th Route Army marked the immediate end of the nationalist assaults. The five nationalist divisions deep inside Jiangxi Soviet immediately started to retreat towards nationalist positions. Fifth phase The 50th Division of the nationalist 9th Route Army became the communists' next target as it began its retreat toward Dongshao from Southern Regiment on January 2, 1931. The communist leaders decided on the same day to pursue the enemy in three directions: *Left wing: The 3rd Legion of the Chinese Red Army would push to Head Slope, attacking Dongshao from the north. *Right wing: The main force of the 3rd Army of the Chinese Red Army would push to Tianying to engage the 24th Division of the nationalist 6th Route Army, preventing it from reinforcing the 50th Division of the nationalist 9th Route Army at Dongshao, while a portion of the 3rd Army of the Chinese Red Army would attack Dongshao from the east. *Central: The 12th Army of the Chinese Red Army would push to Southern Regiment and Linchi, attacking Dongshao from the west. The 4th Army of the Chinese Red Army would act as a strategic reserve, following the 12th Army. The headquarters of the Chinese Red Army would move forward to Longtan to command the upcoming battle. =The second major battle= On January 3, 1931, communist forces on the left and in the center reached Dongshao and commenced their attack, succeeding in driving the enemy from Dongshao by 15:00. However, the communist force on the right failed to reach the battlefield, resulting in the successful escape of part of the nationalist force. Consequences The battle of Dongshao was the second important battle during the first counter-encirclement campaign. The communist victory marked the beginning of a general retreat by the nationalists, thus abandoning all of the regions newly gained during the campaign ‚Äì the communist campaign had succeeded. Outcome The communist victory decimated four nationalist brigades totalling more than 15,000 troops, capturing more than 12,000 guns and artillery pieces. The success of the communist campaign marked the Chinese Red Army's transition from guerrilla warfare to mobile and conventional warfare, setting the pattern for the next three successful counter encirclement campaigns.

Its style at the time was aggressive and direct and it very often published issues other publications will not touch. It had a high reputation among the young generation, but also it was highly respectable and strongly influential into the political levels. In March 2006, the student newspaper Reporteri became its fortnightly supplement on Saturdays. Elton Metaj served as the editor-in-chief of Korrieri which has no political affiliation and a center left political leaning. The publisher of Korrieri was Media 5 Ltd. of which the majority share was owned by the Media 6 JSC. In January 2009 the direction board of the paper decided on a return to mainstream journalism, causing the interruption of all ongoing projects of transformation and returning Korrieri into a middle-low level newspaper as it was before its short golden period.

The Red Army repelled the encirclement by launching their second counter-encirclement campaign (), also called by the communists as the second counter-encirclement campaign at Central Revolutionary Base (), in which the local Chinese Red Army successfully defended the Jiangxi Soviet against the Nationalist attacks from April 1, 1931, to May 31, 1931. Strategies TIME magazine reported that on Jan. 26, 1931, Chinag Kai-shek ordered an offensive launched on January 19 by the 18th army division, when the Red Army managed to encircle it, they gave up their weapons along with the defection of the entire division to the Communist side. 100,000 were reported killed by the Communists. The communists demanded that 2 Million Mexican dollars be paid for the release of the divisional Commander Chang Chi-tsan, Chiang responded with a renewed 4 division offensive. After the defeat of the first encirclement campaign, the nationalists quickly regrouped and prepared for the second encirclement campaign against the Jiangxi Soviet. In February 1931, Chiang Kai-shek named He Yingqing the acting commander-in-chief and deployed nineteen divisions totaling over 200,000 troops for the second encirclement. The nationalists completed their planned deployment by late March 1931. In contrast, the communists were slow to develop their own strategies because of internal power struggles. Wang Ming's prot√©g√© Xiang Ying had reached the Jiangxi Soviet after the third planetary session of the sixth national conference of the Communist Party of China, and on January 15, 1931, the communist Jiangxi Soviet (Communist) Central Bureau for political administration and the Central Military Commission were formed. Xiang Ying became the head of both organizations, as party secretary of the bureau and chairman of the commission. Zhu De and Mao Zedong lost power, as both were only named as deputy chairmen of the commission - though Zhu was named as the commander-in-chief and Mao was named as the political commissar of the 1st Front Army of the Chinese Red Army. Mao was also named as the director of the general political directorate. Xiang Ying's power was further strengthened in April 1931, when Wang Ming's delegation reached the Jiangxi Soviet to assist him to lead. As a result, the communists disagreed on the strategies that should be taken in countering the upcoming nationalist encirclement campaign. The communist leadership dominated by Wang Ming and represented by Xiang Ying decided on strategies consisted of following principles: *Concentrate numerically superior force to destroy the enemy before they grouped together. *Luring the enemy deep into the communist base was a strategy that only applied to the early stages, and communist force should attack the nationalist dominated regions to destroy the enemy instead. *When necessary, Jiangxi Soviet should be abandoned in an attempt to establish new communist bases elsewhere. Given the strength of the communist force at the time, this impractical strategy was obviously out of touch with reality and faced strong opposition. Some members of Wang Ming's own camp even disagreed, and suggested the alternative strategy of separating the communist force to defeat enemy at the multiple fronts. Obviously, this alternative strategy was equally out of touch with reality and at the conference of the communist Central Bureau held from March to April 1931, it could not be decided whether to engage the nationalist 19th Route Army first, or the nationalist 6th Route Army first. With the support of most commanders, Mao Zedong opposed both impractical strategies developed by the newly arrived prot√©g√©s of Wang Ming. Mao reasoned the nationalist 6th Army, 19th Army and 26th Army were some of the strongest armies among nationalist forces, and thus were difficult targets. In contrast, the 43rd Division, 47th Division, and 54th Division of the nationalist 5th Army were just newly arrived from north, while the 28th Division and 77th Division of the nationalist 5th Army were previously defeated by the communists in the last encirclement campaign, thus they were weak and less enthusiastic in actively engaging communist forces, hence should be engaged first by the communists. In the meantime, if the communists were to strike westward from the east, the Gan River would be a limit. If the communists were to strike eastward from Rich Field (Futian, ÂØåÁî∞) in the west, then not only there would not be any geographic limits, but regions in the border of Fujian and Jiangxi including Lichuan (ÈªéÂ∑ù), Taining, (Ê≥∞ÂÆÅ), Jianning, (Âª∫ÂÆÅ) would likely to fall into communist hands more easily, resulting in expanding the communist base. Therefore, communists should adopt the same successful strategies proven in the last encirclement campaign, and Mao's idea was accepted by everyone after lengthy debates. On March 23, 1931, communist forces withdrew to regions including Eternal Abundance, (Yongfeng, Ê∞∏‰∏∞), Yue'an, (‰πêÂÆâ), Yihuang (ÂÆúÈªÑ) and Nanfeng, at the northern border of the Jiangxi Soviet to regions in the south, including Guangchang (ÂπøÊòå), Shicheng, Ningdu and Ruijin. Massive mobilization efforts were conducted to mobilize local population to defend the communist base.

Communist order of battle: (30,000+ total) *First Front Army of Chinese Red Army Campaign On April 1, 1931, the second encirclement campaign against Jiangxi Soviet formally began as the nationalists attacked in four fronts and by April 23, they had taken regions abandoned by the communists, including Jiangbeidong (Ê±üËÉåÊ¥û), Longgangtou (ÈæôÂÜàÂ§¥), Futian (ÂØåÁî∞), Shuinan (Ê∞¥Âçó), Yanfang (‰∏•Âùä), Zhaoxie (ÊãõÊê∫) and Guangchang (ÂπøÊòå). In the meantime, the communist force withdrew to regions including Longgang (ÈæôÂÜà), Shanggu (‰∏äÂõ∫) and Donggu (‰∏úÂõ∫) to wait for the opportunity to pounce on the nationalists, and secretly gathered right next to the nationalist force in Donggu (‰∏úÂõ∫) region without being detected for twenty-five days. On May 13, 1931, the communists got the opportunity they had been waiting for when the nationalist 28th Division and a brigade of the nationalist 47th Division began to move toward Donggu (‰∏úÂõ∫) from Futian (ÂØåÁî∞). The communists ambushed the unsuspecting nationalists and after two days of fighting that lasted from May 15 to May 17, 1931, the ambushed nationalist force was completely destroyed in the regions of Zhongdong (‰∏≠Ê¥û) and Jiucunling (‰πùÂØ∏Â≤≠). Continuing their counteroffensives, the communists badly mauled the nationalist 43rd Division on May 19 in the region of Baisha (ÁôΩÊ≤ô), the nationalist survivors were forced to flee to the region of Yongfeng (Ê∞∏‰∏∞). Unaware that their comrades-in-arms had already been defeated, nationalist 27th Division went out to reinforce their besieged comrades-in-arms and was ambushed in the region of Zhongcun (‰∏≠Êùë) on May 22, with an entire brigade acting as a vanguard was lost. Unable to rescue its vanguard, the rest of the nationalist 27th Division wisely chose to abandon the fight and withdrew safely. On May 27, 1931, the communist counteroffensive led their victory at Guangchang (ÂπøÊòå), retaking the city and badly mauling the nationalist 5th Division in the process, including severely wounding its commander Hu Zuyu (ËÉ°Á•ñÁéâ), who eventually died of his wounds in the campaign. On May 31, 1931, the communists attacked Jianning (Âª∫ÂÆÅ), badly mauling the nationalist 56th Division, which lost an entire brigade. After five consecutive defeats in sixteen days and being pushed back near four hundred kilometers thus losing all of their newly gained territory, the nationalists had enough and decided to end the campaign by withdrawing. The communists subsequently declared a victory. Aftermath The communists managed to annihilate over thirty thousand nationalist troops and captured over twenty thousand guns, and Gong Bingpan (ÂÖ¨ÁßâËó©), the commander of the nationalist 28th Division was captured alive by the communists, the highest ranking nationalist captured in the campaign, but he cleverly escaped by avoiding being recognized by the communists: After the nationalists withdraw, each nationalist prisoner was given two silver dollars to go home. Gong Bingpan (ÂÖ¨ÁßâËó©) carefully waited all the way in the back of the crowd to avoid being identified and recognized, but as he was called to receive his money, there was only one silver dollar left. Communists in charge wanted Gong Bingpan (ÂÖ¨ÁßâËó©) to wait so that they could get another silver dollar for him but this delay would only provide more chances for him to be recognized. Gong Bingpan (ÂÖ¨ÁßâËó©) cleverly told the communists: \\"Comrades, I have friends in Ji'an who could provide me financial assistance, and I would only need a single silver dollar, there is no need to get another one\\". The communists were of course very happy in saving a silver dollar and thus let him go with only one silver dollar. Gong Bingpan (ÂÖ¨ÁßâËó©)'s experience was important because it would later help other high ranking nationalist commanders captured in later encirclement campaigns to successfully escape, thus avoiding certain jail time or even possible execution. Capitalizing on their victory, the communists launched a series of offensives against the nationalists, taking several counties in eastern Jiangxi and western Fujian, including Lichuan (ÈªéÂ∑ù), Nanfeng, (Âçó‰∏∞), Jianning, (Âª∫ÂÆÅ), Taining, (Ê≥∞ÂÆÅ), Ninghua, (ÂÆÅÂåñ) and Changding (ÈïøÊ±Ä), further expanding the Jiangxi Soviet.

It was launched less than a month after the previous campaign failed. However, this encirclement was repelled by the Red Army's third counter-encirclement campaign at the Central Soviet (), also called as the third counter-encirclement campaign at the Central Revolutionary Base (). Strategy Merely three weeks after the defeat of the second encirclement campaign, Chiang Kai-shek reached Nanchang on June 21, 1931 with his foreign military advisory delegations including military advisors from Great Britain, Germany and Japan. The nationalists planned to launch another encirclement campaign in very short time so that their communist enemy would not have enough time to regroup and prepare for the upcoming battles, and Chiang himself became the commander-in-chief of the nationalist force consisting of twenty-four divisions totaling more than three hundred thousand troops. The attacking nationalist forces were divided into two army groups, with the He Yingqing named as the commander-in-chief of the left flank army group, and Chen Mingshu as the commander-in-chief as the right flank army group.

Communist order of battle: (30,000+ total) *First Front Army of Chinese Red Army Campaign On July 1, 1931, the nationalists began their offensive. The communists had not fully recovered yet from the last encirclement campaign and Wang Ming's prot√©g√©s including Xiang Ying had to agree with Mao Zedong's decision to adopt the proven strategies in the earlier campaigns by letting the nationalists penetrate deep into the communist base and then to counterattack individual isolated enemy formations as they were dispersed. On July 10, 1931, the communist main force left western Fujian and traveled more than five hundred kilometers back to Xingguo in southern Jiangxi and waited their opportunities to counterattack. By the end of July 1931, nationalists had discovered that the communist main force had withdrawn to Xingguo, and Chiang Kai-shek immediately ordered his troops to simultaneously attack southward from north and westward from east, so that communists would be forced onto the eastern bank of Gan River and annihilated. The communists, in turn, decided to avoid direct clash with main nationalist force but instead, attack the weaker ones by outflanking the nationalists. To achieve their goal, communists planned to strike Futian (ÂØåÁî∞) from Xingguo via Wan'an (‰∏áÂÆâ), and then to strike eastward from the west to sever the nationalist communication/supply lines while the main nationalist force was trapped deep inside the communist base. As the main communist force moved toward Futian (ÂØåÁî∞), its intent was discovered by the nationalists and the nationalist 11th and 14th Division reached Futian (ÂØåÁî∞) ahead of the communists, resulting in the communist main force being blocked by the Gan River in the west, and facing the nationalist forces in the east, south and north. The communist high command decided to change their strategy by breaking through in the center and move eastward to the regions of Liantang (Ëé≤Â°ò), Liangcun (ËâØÊùë), and Huangbi (ÈªÑÈôÇ). In order to hide their true objective, the 35th Army and the 35th Division of the 12th Army of the Chinese Red Army pretended to be the communist main force and moved towards the Gan River to fool nationalists. The main communist force, meanwhile, swiftly moved to the region of Liantang (Ëé≤Â°ò) at the night under the cover of the darkness on August 4, 1931 via passing through a twenty-kilometer gap in the nationalist lines between the nationalist divisions commanded Cai Tingkai and Jiang Dingwen. On August 7, 1931, communists succeeded in annihilating more than a brigade of troops from the nationalist 47th Division in the region of Liantang (Ëé≤Â°ò), and soon afterward, badly mauling the nationalist 54th Division in Liangcun (ËâØÊùë). On August 11, 1931, communists succeeded in completely destroying four regiments of the nationalist 8th Division at Huangbi (ÈªÑÈôÇ), and after three consecutive defeats, the nationalist advance was checked temporarily. Realizing the communist main force was moving eastward, the nationalist troops moving southward and westward were ordered to move eastward on August 9, 1931, in an attempt to sounding the communist main force in the region to the east of Junbu (ÂêõÂü†). The communists ordered their 12th Army (missing its 35th Division) of the Chinese Red Army to move toward Yue'an (‰πêÂÆâ) to lure the nationalists northeastward, while the communist main force secretly returned to Xingguo by quietly passing a ten kilometer-wide gap in the nationalist encirclement in the mountain. Half a month later, nationalists chasing the communist 12th Army realized they were after the wrong target and abandoned the chase. As the over stretched nationalist forces attempted to regroup, the communists already had plenty of time to rest and regrouped already, and the nationalist morale dropped to a new low while their supplies had run out. Realizing further fighting was impossible, nationalists were forced to abandon their plans by starting to withdraw in early September, 1931. Taking the opportunity, communists counterattacked, and the only nationalist offensive still remaining was successfully checked when the nationalist 60th Division and 61st Division were forced to be on the defensive and abandoned all offensive attempts. Communists were not satisfied with this success and did not consider it a victory, but a draw instead, and continued their offensive on other fronts. On September 7, 1931, they succeeded in destroying an entire brigade of the nationalist 9th Division in the region of Laoyingpan (ËÄÅËê•Áõò), and on September 15, 1931, another brigade of the nationalist 9th Division and the entire nationalist 52nd Division were completely destroyed by the communists in the region of Fangshiling (ÊñπÁü≥Â≤≠). The nationalist commander of the 52nd Division, Han Deqin, was captured alive together with his staff, becoming the highest ranking nationalist commander captured, but they had successfully avoided being identified by disguising themselves as ordinary soldiers and each received two dollars in silver when released after the campaign. A total of seven nationalist divisions were badly mauled in the six battles, which communists themselves labeled as five victories and one draw, and nationalists suffered over 30,000 casualties. In addition, the communists also captured more than 20,000 rifles in their victory. Aftermath Capitalizing on their victory, communists launched their offensives into the nationalist dominated regions, further expanding their communist base in Jiangxi, resulting in previously two separate communist bases in southern Jiangxi and western Fujian joining together into a larger one, covering twenty-one counties totaling more than fifty square kilometers, with permanent residents totaling more than two and half a million. The communist success paved the way for the communist base to later expand to its ultimate size with population over three million. It was worth to note that though Mao Zedong was still viewed by many communists as the supreme commander, his positions had already been actually reduced significantly since the last encirclement campaign, and it was only because Wang Ming's prot√©g√©s had not yet fully established their absolute authority, plus the fact that Mao's previous proven strategies had once more been applied in this campaign that created the false impression that Mao was still the supreme leader. After this campaign, Mao soon fell from power as the internal political power struggle intensified and Wang Ming emerged victorious. The encirclement stopped because the Japanese launched the Mukden Incident.

The Nationalist headquarters in the provincial border of Jiangxi-Guangdong-Fujian organized nearly 400,000 men, and prepared for another major encirclement on the Chinese Soviet Republic. As a response, the Jiangxi Soviet launched the fourth counter-encirclement campaign at the Central Soviet (), also called as the fourth counter-encirclement campaign at the Central Revolutionary Base (). Although the Red Army achieved victory once again, their counter encirclement was not as successful as the previous ones this time, and the Red Army elsewhere suffered considerable loss when many other communist bases were lost, including two major ones. Prelude While launching encirclement campaigns against communist bases in the border region of Hunan ‚Äì western Hubei and the border region of Hubei ‚Äì Henan ‚Äì Anhui, plans of the fourth encirclement against Jiangxi Soviet was already begun. Nationalists planned to annihilate the first two communist bases and then concentrate on the last one. He Yingqing was named as the frontline commander- in-chief and by October 1932, the nationalists had successfully completed the first half of their objective by destroying the communist bases in the border region of Hunan ‚Äì western Hubei and the border region of Hubei ‚Äì Henan ‚Äì Anhui, and thus turned their attention to Jiangxi Soviet. Strategies In December, 1932, He Yingqin had completed the mobilization of more than three dozen nationalist divisions totaling over half a million troops for the fourth encirclement campaign against the Jiangxi Soviet. The nationalist troops were divided into three fronts with Chiang Kai-shek's own troops as the central front, totaling more than 160,000. The central front shouldered the main responsibility of attacking the communist enemy while the left and right fronts were tasked to assist the main attack in the central front. The rest of the nationalist force consisting around sixty percent of the half a million mobilized troops were tasked to develop and man the blockade line, an effective strategy which would be proven in the next encirclement campaigns. The nationalists planned to annihilate the communist main force in the regions of Jianning (Âª∫ÂÆÅ) and Lichuan (ÈªéÂ∑ù). In January, 1933, Chen Cheng, the commander of nationalist central front, further divided the nationalist troops under his command into three columns, and begun their offensive against their communist enemy. The communists originally planned according to the new doctrines of Wang Ming by launching a preemptive strike against the nationalists before their mobilization and deployment was complete. Communists would concentrate their forces to destroy nationalists in the regions of Fu River (Fu Jiang, ÊäöÊ±ü) first, and then went on to score their victory in entire Jiangxi province. To achieve this goal, the 10th Army of the Chinese Red Army crossed Letter River (Xin Jiang, ‰ø°Ê±ü), and jointed forces with the 31st Division of the Chinese Red Army, forming the 11th Army of the Chinese Red Army. By mid March, 1933, communist formed the Chinese Red Army Southeastern Front Command, which was in charge of communist forces organized into five columns in southern Jiangxi and western Fujian, to coordinate their actions with the communists in the north bearing the brunt of the fighting. Order of battle Nationalist order of battle (totaling over half a million): *Left front commanded by Cai Tingkai: **19th Route Army in Fujian consisted of six divisions and a brigade *Right front commanded by Yu Hanmou: ** Six divisions and a brigade stationed in southern Jiangxi and northern Guangdong *Central front totaling more than 160,000 commanded by Chen Cheng (Chiang's own troop): **1st Column commanded by Luo Zhuoying stationed in the regions of Yihuang (ÂÆúÈªÑ) and Yue'an (‰πêÂÆâ): ***11th Division ***52nd Division ***59th Division **2nd Column commanded by Wu Qiwei (Âê¥Â•á‰ºü) stationed in the regions of Fuzhou (ÊäöÂ∑û) and Dragon Bone's Crossing (Longgudu, ÈæôÈ™®Ê∏°): ***10th Division ***14th Division ***27th Division ***90th Division **3rd Column commanded by Zhao Guantao (ËµµËßÇÊ∂õ) stationed in the regions of Golden Stream (Jinxi, ÈáëÊ∫™) and Marginal Bay (Huwan, ÊµíÊπæ): ***5th Division ***6th Division ***9th Division ***79th Division **Reserve of Central Front: ***43rd Division *Counterguerrilla garrisons stationed at regions of Southern City (Nancheng ÂçóÂüé), Southern Abundance (Nanfeng, Âçó‰∏∞), Yue'an (‰πêÂÆâ), Chongren (Â¥á‰ªÅ), and Eternal Abundance (Yongfeng, Ê∞∏‰∏∞) **5 Divisions and 2 Brigades *Wings of RoCAF *Other nationalist forces mobilized to build and man the blockade lines. Communist order of battle *1st Front Army of Chinese Red Army totaling over 70,000: **1st Legion **3rd Legion **5th Legion **11th Army **12th Army **21st Army **22nd Army Initial battles In early February, 1933, the nationalist successful strategy of holding their position in the newly built fortifications with large troops prevailed. Zhu De and Zhou Enlai, the communist commander-in-chief and general political commissar of the Chinese Red Army realized it was simply impossible to destroy nationalist forces on the eastern bank of Fu (Êäö) River, and decided to lead the communist main force to cross the Fu (Êäö) River and attack the town of Southern Abundance (Nanfeng, Âçó‰∏∞) instead. The two communist commanders also acknowledged that it was quite possible that the nationalists would not fall for the communist trick and communists had to give up the attempt to take the town of Southern Abundance (Nanfeng, Âçó‰∏∞) and attack Yihuang (ÂÆúÈªÑ) and Yue'an (‰πêÂÆâ) instead, so that the nationalists could be ambushed in mobile warfare in the mountains where the numerically and technically inferior communists had advantages over their nationalist adversary. In the evening on February 12, 1933, communist 3rd and 5th Legions of Chinese Red Army begun their attack on nationalist positions in the northwestern suburb of the town of Southern Abundance (Nanfeng, Âçó‰∏∞). However, the two brigades of the nationalist 8th Division successfully fended off the communist attacks by adopting the successful tactic of holding on to their positions in the fortifications instead of getting out and engaging the enemy in the open. Chen Cheng learned the news and immediately ordered the nationalist 24th Division to reinforce the town of Southern Abundance (Nanfeng, Âçó‰∏∞) and in the meantime, Chen Cheng also ordered the nationalist central front to speed southward to the region in order to trap and annihilate the communist main force. Realizing the danger they would be in, Zhu De and Zhou Enlai decided to give up the attempt to take town of Southern Abundance (Nanfeng, Âçó‰∏∞). On February 22, 1933, the 11th Army of the Chinese Red Army was ordered to disguise as the main force to move toward Lichuan (ÈªéÂ∑ù) by cross the Fu (Êäö) River at the region of New Abundance Street (Xinfengjie, Êñ∞‰∏∞Ë°ó). While the nationalists were distracted, the communist main force secretly moved to the regions of Dongshao (‰∏úÈü∂) and Luokou (Ê¥õÂè£) to wait for other opportunities to attack their nationalist adversary. Subsequent battles He Yingqin erroneously believed that the communist main force had gathered in the region of Lichuan (ÈªéÂ∑ù), and ordered the nationalist central front to attack toward Lichuan (ÈªéÂ∑ù) and Guangchang (ÂπøÊòå). The nationalist 1st Column was to attack and take Guangchang (ÂπøÊòå) and Ningdu from Yihuang (ÂÆúÈªÑ) and Yue'an (‰πêÂÆâ). The nationalist 2nd Column was to attack Kangdu (Â∫∑ÈÉΩ) and take from Southern City (Nancheng, ÂçóÂüé), Southern Abundance (Nanfeng, Âçó‰∏∞). The two nationalist columns would meet at Guangchang (ÂπøÊòå) after annihilating their communist enemy. The nationalist 1st Column had marched into mountains covered with thick forest, and it was isolated from the nationalist 2nd and 3rd Columns, so the communists decided to concentrate their forces to ambush nationalist 52nd and 59th Divisions of the 1st Column in the regions of Huangbi (ÈªÑÈôÇ) and Yihuang (ÂÆúÈªÑ). On February 26, 1933, the nationalist 52nd Division and 59th Division marched toward Huangbi (ÈªÑÈôÇ) from Yue'an (‰πêÂÆâ) on different routes, separated by Moluozhang (Êë©ÁΩóÂ∂Ç) Mountain, and they were ambushed by the waiting communists. From the morning of February 27 thru the afternoon of February 28, 1933, after fierce fighting, the nationalist 52nd Division was completely destroyed with its divisional commander Li Ming (ÊùéÊòé) captured alive by the enemy. The nationalist 59th Division suffered similar fate with its divisional commander Chen Shiji (ÈôàÊó∂È™•) also captured alive by the enemy, but a single regiment was successful in escape the enemy onslaught. Last battles After defeat at Huangbi (ÈªÑÈôÇ), the nationalists changed their strategy in the middle of March 1933 by attempting to break through in the center. To do so, the nationalist force was redeployed: the nationalist 2nd Column became the vanguard, while the nationalist 1st Column and the 5th Division and the 9th Division of the nationalist 3rd Column became the rearguard, and two other divisions acted as the general reserve. Nationalists attacked from regions of Dongbi (‰∏úÈôÇ) and Huangbi (ÈªÑÈôÇ) toward Guangchang (ÂπøÊòå), in attempt to lure out the communist main force for a decisive engagement. The communists, in turn, deployed their 11th Army disguised as their main force in to the northwest of Guangchang (ÂπøÊòå) to lure the nationalist vanguard further south, while the communist main force itself moved northward to ambush the nationalist rearguard. On March 20, 1933, the 11th Division of the nationalist rearguard had reached the region between Grass Stage Hill (Caotaigang, ËçâÂè∞ÂÜà) and Village of Xu (Xuzhuang, ÂæêÂ∫Ñ), with the surviving regiment of the nationalist 59th Division following behind. The nationalist 9th Division was still near Dongbi (‰∏úÈôÇ) and was more than fifty kilometers away from the near nationalist forces. On dawn of March 21, 1933, the communist first launched the surprise attack on the unsuspecting nationalist 11th Division, succeeding in completely destroying it in the region of Grass Stage Hill (Caotaigang, ËçâÂè∞ÂÜà). The next day, the nationalist 9th Division at Dongbi (‰∏úÈôÇ) was badly mauled by the communists. Hearing the news of the disaster, all other overstretched nationalist forces withdrew and ended the campaign to rest and regroup for future actions. Aftermath The communist victory resulted in annihilating over thirty thousands nationalist troops, including capturing more than ten thousands, in addition, the communists also managed to capture over ten thousands guns from the nationalists. Although Mao Zedong had already lost power to Wang Ming in the internal power struggle, his successful strategies proven in the previous encirclement campaigns were adopted one last time by Zhou Enlai, who was the prot√©g√© of Wang Ming at the time, and unlike other communists elsewhere who suffered disastrous defeats, resulted in another victory. However, the communist jubilation would not last long, for that as Wang Ming's new strategies were adopted in full, the communist defeat in Jiangxi Soviet in the next encirclement campaigns would be far more catastrophic. Although the nationalist offensive was successfully repelled by the communists, their victory was not complete in that most of the nationalist forces withdrawn did not return to their original posts, but instead, started building blockade lines along the border of Jiangxi Soviet, thus begun the very successful tactic used in the next encirclement campaign. Furthermore, as Mao Zedong had lost power to Wang Ming, his proven successful strategies were abolished and this campaign was the last time it was adopted. Elsewhere, communists suffered huge losses as Wang Ming's new strategies of static defense and clashing head on with numerical and technical superior nationalist forces were adopted, resulting in communists losing most of their other bases, including two major ones, plus all of the smaller ones.

Greenwood (April 19, 1857 - May 2, 1902) was an American Major League Baseball player (mostly a second baseman) for six seasons from to . He played more games at second base than any other left-handed player. Career Greenwood was fast and was often among the league leaders in stolen bases, but he usually hit for a mediocre batting average. He was a left-handed infielder, not entirely uncommon in the 19th century, and he is the all-time leader in games played at second base by a left-hander with 538. He also played 30 games at shortstop. For the season, he signed and was playing for the Merrits of Camden, New Jersey, when Charlie Byrne of a fellow league team, the Brooklyn Grays, bought his contract, along with other Merrits Sam Kimber, Charlie Householder, Frank Fennelly, and Jack Corcoran. He finished out the year and transitioned with the team over to the American Association, where they would be known as the Atlantics. Playing in the AA until 1890, Greenwood changed teams every year, except for 1887-88, when he played two seasons for the Baltimore Orioles. His 1887 season with Baltimore was one of his best; he hit .263, recorded 65 RBI, and stole 71 bases. During an 1887 home game, Greenwood was on the receiving end of a collision at second base from St. Louis Browns outfielder Curt Welch. The collision angered Baltimore fans, and St. Louis players had to run off the field to avoid the irate fans. The next year, his batting average fell to .191 and he did not hit above .225 again in the major leagues. Greenwood thought that his biggest struggle as a left-handed middle infielder was fielding ground balls, but he also had a problem that would be expected of a left-hander: making quick, accurate throws to first base. Compounding his problems was the fact that he liked to drink to excess, so he sometimes got on the bad side of a manager with his behavior. Post-career Greenwood died in his hometown of Philadelphia at the age of 45. He had a heart attack while discussing the Athletics game that had been played that day. He is interred at the Mount Moriah Cemetery in Philadelphia.

Accompanying the Texas flagship, Austin, she defeated a larger force of Mexican Navy steamships in the Naval Battle of Campeche in May 1843. Transferred to the United States Navy in 1846, she was sold for $55. Background of the Texas Navy The Texas Navy was officially formed in January 1836, with the purchase of four schooners: Invincible, Brutus, Independence, and Liberty. These ships, under the command of Commodore Charles Hawkins, helped Texas win independence by preventing a Mexican blockade of the Texas coast, seizing Mexican ships carrying reinforcements and supplies to its army, and sending their cargoes to the Texas volunteer army. Nevertheless, Mexico refused to recognize Texas as an independent country. By the middle of 1837, all of the ships had been lost at sea, run aground, captured, or sold. With no ships to impede a possible invasion by Mexico, Texas was vulnerable to attack. In 1838, President Mirabeau B. Lamar responded to this threat by forming a second Texas Navy. Unlike Sam Houston, Lamar was an ardent supporter of the Texas Navy and saw the urgent need for its continuation. The second Texas Navy was placed under the command of Commodore Edwin Ward Moore, an Alexandria Academy graduate who was recruited from the United States Navy. One of the ships of this second navy was the Wharton along with her sister ship, the Archer. History of the Wharton Pennant of the Wharton Wharton was built in Baltimore, Maryland at the Schott and Whitney shipyard. Originally called the Colorado, she was rechristened in honor of John Austin Wharton, a hero of the battle of San Jacinto. From her commissioning until January 1842, Wharton remained in Galveston awaiting provisions and repairs. =Cruises to Campeche= Leaving Galveston in January, Wharton reached Commodore Moore's squadron off the Yucatan port of Sisal on April 18, 1842. The Wharton brought word to Commodore Moore that the Republic of Texas had declared a blockade of the Mexican coast and Wharton remained in Mexican waters to help enforce it until May 1842. Returning to Galveston, the Wharton saw almost her crew quit the service as a result of expiring enlistments and desertions. In late May 1842, she sailed to New Orleans for much-needed repairs with only nine sailors. After receiving a complete overhaul and recruiting a new crew at New Orleans, the Wharton and Moore's flagship, the Austin set out on April 19, 1843 again for a cruise off the Yucatan coast. They sailed to Campeche and there engaged the Mexican steam frigate Moctezuma on April 30 in the first Naval Battle of Campeche. Although the Austin and the Wharton succeeded in temporarily driving the Mexican fleet from Yucatan waters, the Wharton was struck by a sixty-eight-pound shot; two men were killed and four were wounded when one of her own guns exploded during the two days of fighting. A decisive second engagement with the Mexican fleet on May 16, 1843, resulted in a clear Texan victory. The Austin and the Wharton left Mexican waters on June 25 and arrived at Galveston on July 14, 1843, effectively bringing to an end the active service of the Texas navy, as the ships would never leave port again. =Transfer to the U.S. Navy= When the United States formally annexed Texas on May 11, 1846, the Wharton was transferred to the United States Navy, which in turn sold the ship to the city of Galveston for fifty-five dollars on November 30, 1846. Commanders of the Vessel The Wharton was commanded by: * Capt. Edwin Ward Moore, November 1839‚ÄîFebruary 1840 * Commander George W. Wheelwright, February 1840‚ÄîJanuary 1842 * Lt. John T. K.

He received the Society for American Archaeology's Lifetime Achievement Award, the Paleoarchaeologist of the Century Award, and was elected to the National Academy of Sciences. He was Wyoming‚Äôs first State Archaeologist, and was a founder of the University of Wyoming Anthropology Department. He died in September 2020 at the age of 95.Famed UW Archaeologist George Frison Dies at 95 Early life Frison‚Äôs grandparents, Jake and Margaret Frison, homesteaded to Leadville, Colorado in 1890 with the dream of starting a cattle ranch. Unsatisfied by the limitations of their ranch property, they decided to try their ranching luck in the town of Ten Sleep in Northern Wyoming in 1901. By the 1920s, the ranch was a viable cattle operation with the three sons of Jake and Margaret obtaining their own homesteads of each. George Frison was born in Worland, Wyoming on November 11, 1924 (Thomson Gale 2007). Frison‚Äôs father was killed in an accident in 1924 before George Frison was born. Frison‚Äôs mother left when George was three, and his paternal grandparents in Wyoming raised him. Frison took to ranching as a young man and helped his grandparents run the family ranch. Frison was intrigued by fossil dinosaur and mammoth bones he found as a youngster in Wyoming, along with a variety of archaeological features such as chipped and ground stone tools, rock shelters, rock art, and scaffold burials (Vittitow 2006). Many researchers, such as geologist Harold Cook, paleontologist Glenn Jepsen, and anthropologist Waldo Wedel were investigating the areas near the Frison ranch for various research projects. Frison was intrigued by Paleontologist Barnum Brown, of the American Museum of Natural History, who excavated dinosaur beds close to the Frison ranch in 1934. Frison brought several cigar boxes of fossils to him to identify. Barnum was the researcher who identified the bison bones at the Folsom site in New Mexico, so he discussed the Folsom complex with a young George Frison, who had never heard of Folsom before. These experiences were helping to shape Frison‚Äôs interest in and knowledge of both fossils and ancient American cultures (Vittitow 2006). George Frison was an accomplished hunter and learned about hunting and animal behavior from his grandfather. Through experience and family ethics, Frison as a hunter was able to adopt a philosophy of conservation that worked for both the hunter and the hunted, and the common environment that both had to live in. Frison later believed that his philosophy must also have been the philosophy of early hunters. When he was 11 years old he had his first, and most unforgettable, incident with a bison bull in a state park near Thermopolis, about from his home ranch, when ten loose bison wandered from the park, and Frison was able to secure permission to assist local cowhands to escort the bison back to the park. A young bison bull that created too much confusion among the other bison was left behind. Frison found the bison bull grazing a few days later and decided to outrun the bull on horseback. After both Frison and the bison cleared two fences, the bull stopped at the third fence, turned 180 degrees and decided to charge. Frison soon learned how an awkward and docile bison could soon be a danger, as both Frison and his horse toppled to the ground when the bull passed between the horse‚Äôs legs. However, all three managed to sustain no injury (Frison 2004). After graduation from high school in 1942, Frison enrolled in the University of Wyoming. His education was cut short when World War II began and he decided to enlist in the United States Navy. He served in the amphibious forces of the South Pacific during World War II, and received an honorable discharge in 1946 to return to Ten Sleep to work on the family ranch. He felt with the thought that the ranch ‚Äúwas the only place on earth‚Ä¶I really wanted to get back to it and it needed somebody to really do some work on the place and hold it together. At that point, I didn‚Äôt have any great desire to go back to school (Vittitow 2006).‚Äù At this time he also began work as a hunting guide, and married June Granville (Vittitow 2006). Frison joined the Wyoming Archaeological Society and spent over 20 years working as an avocational archaeologist. In 1952 George discovered a hidden cave full of atlatl and dart fragments, which were used by ancient American hunters as spear throwers, and took them to local archaeologist Dr. William Mulloy. George learned how to make the darts and atlatls himself and later, in 1965, described and published work on the cave now known as Springer Creek. In 1956, George and June Frison adopted a daughter, Carol Frison Placek, who was born in 1952 (Beaver 2006). George continued to work as an avocational archaeologist until 1962 when the Frison family ranch and hunting and guiding business ended (Frison 2004). While attending a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Denver in 1961, Frison learned that in order to succeed with an academic career in archaeology, he must have a formal university education. Frison sought advice from Professor William Mulloy at the University of Wyoming regarding future research and educational possibilities, and in 1962 he decided to enroll at the University of Wyoming, at age 37, to finish his undergraduate work (Frison 2004). Education In 1964 George Frison received a Bachelor of Science degree with honors in anthropology from the University of Wyoming (Vittitow 2006). Frison proceeded to graduate school at the University of Michigan with a fellowship from the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation, under James B. Griffin and Arthur Jelinek (Beaver 2006). Frison soon learned that the current literature on human hunters and hunting lacked credibility, and rarely took into account the hunted animal‚Äôs behavior, and often portrayed the hunter using unrealistic and illogical forms of hunting methodology (Frison 2004). In 1965 George Frison received a Master‚Äôs degree in anthropology from the University of Michigan, and was accepted into the University‚Äôs PhD program. In 1967, he received his Doctorate degree in anthropology from the University of Michigan. Timeline of accomplishments *1967: Frison was appointed head of the newly formed Anthropology Department at the University of Wyoming. He builds the University of Wyoming‚Äôs Anthropology Department from a two faculty member undergraduate program in 1968 to a highly regarded PhD program (Vittitow 2006). *1968: Appointed the first Wyoming State Archaeologist (Beaver 2006). *1972: Frison was elected President of the board of the Plains Anthropological Society for one year (Beaver 2006). *1995: Retires from the University of Wyoming Anthropology Department (Beaver 2006). *1997: Elected to the National Academy of Sciences, while the University of Wyoming‚Äôs Board of Trustees established the George C. Frison Institute of Archaeology and Anthropology, a research facility dedicated to the study of North American, High Plains, and Rocky Mountain archaeology (Vittitow 2006). *1999: Received the Paleoarchaeologist of the Century award at the \\"Clovis and Beyond\\" conference (Beaver 2006). *2005: Frison was awarded the Society for American Archaeology Lifetime Achievement Award (Vittitow 2006). *2007: Frison served as Professor Emeritus of Anthropology at the University of Wyoming. Theory and practice George Frison‚Äôs main focus of research had been the Paleoindian mammoth hunters of prehistoric North America beginning over 11,500 years ago (Vittitow 2006). He had studied mammoth hunting culture, mainly from the tools and bones left behind, across the Great Plains, the Rocky Mountains, Africa, and the former Soviet Union. In 1976, Frison‚Äôs research on chipped-stone tools gave rise to the expression \\"the Frison Effect,\\" which described how sharpening the edges of stone tools changes their shape and their use. The end product may look nothing like the original tool. This has often led to debate because archaeologists rely on tool shapes to understand different cultures (Vittitow 2006). Frison traveled to Africa in the 1980s to observe African elephants in their natural habitats and to gain information for proposing strategies of procurement for African elephants, that could be applied to mammoth hunters. Frison became aware that prehistoric hunters had to become experts in mammoth behavior in order to survive (Vittitow 2006). Frison strongly advocated realistic experimentation with ancient tools, so he experimented in Zimbabwe, with modern-made Clovis points on dead and dying elephants, that were culled to get rid of excess numbers. He found that the Clovis tools were not only adequate, but very successful in penetrating the hide and ribcage of an African elephant, and quite possibly a mammoth as well. He published the results in 1989. Frison also traveled to the former Soviet Union in 1989, after the Cold War had ended, for research on mammoths, and mammoth sites (Vittitow 2006). It has been a popular notion that early American hunters killed off the large game, such as mammoths, that inhabited North America in the Late Pleistocene (Alroy 2001, Grayson 1977). However, Frison saw tribal cultures as having numerous rituals and restrictions against excess hunting and excess production. Frison hypothesized that there would be no incentive to kill more animals that one would need, and that the real cause of the late Pleistocene megafaunal mass extinction was climate, not humans (Vittitow 2006). Frison believed that the earliest New World human group that was making stone weaponry capable of killing mammoths, and successful mammoth procurement, was the Clovis culture, and that no earlier cultural group in North America possessed the tools needed to produce lethal wounds on mammoths, extinct species of bison, and other large animals, or to create a viable subsistence strategy based on large animal hunting and procurement. Frison also believed that the modern counterparts of extinct North American species such as horses, elephants, and camels, are potential and plausible subjects of study and speculation for scientists, and that studies such as the Zimbabwe Clovis experiment on elephants should continue, being necessary part of gaining understanding of behavioral patterns, as well as procurement strategies of past cultures (Frison 2004).

The band is composed of classically trained cellists Eicca Toppinen, Paavo L√∂tj√∂nen, and Perttu Kivilaakso (all three of whom are graduates of the Sibelius Academy in Helsinki), and drummer Mikko Sir√©n. Originally a Metallica classical tribute band, the band eventually adopted a neoclassical metal style without the use of conventional guitars. They have sold over four million albums to date. History Four cellists, Eicca Toppinen, Paavo L√∂tj√∂nen, Max Lilja, and Antero Manninen formed Apocalyptica in 1993 at Sibelius Academy. The band released their debut studio album, Plays Metallica by Four Cellos, in 1996. The album consisted of only Metallica covers. The band was featured on two songs on the Waltari album Space Avenue in 1997. Apocalyptica released their second studio album, Inquisition Symphony, produced by Hiili Hiilesmaa in 1998. Inquisition Symphony contained covers of Metallica as well as Faith No More, Sepultura, and Pantera. The album included three original songs by Eicca Toppinen. Antero Manninen left the group in 1999 and was replaced by Perttu Kivilaakso. Perttu had previously performed with the band in 1995. Apocalyptica released their third studio album, Cult, in 2000. It featured 10 original songs and 3 covers. The first Apocalyptica track to include vocals, \\"Path Vol. 2\\", was released shortly after Cult. Max Lilja left the group in 2002 and joined Hevein. Apocalyptica released their fourth studio album, Reflections, in 2003. It featured all original songs. Reflections featured an experimental sound different from the acoustic arrangements of Inquisition Symphony and Cult. Dave Lombardo from Slayer played drums on five songs from Reflections. Session drummer, Sami Kuoppam√§ki, covered the rest. When Lombardo declined the following tour, Apocalyptica hired Mikko Sir√©n, who would stay with the band for future tours as well as the recording of the next album. Apocalyptica released their self- titled fifth studio album in 2005 which featured Ville Valo of HIM, Lauri Yl√∂nen of The Rasmus, and Dave Lombardo. Apocalyptica was on the track \\"Intro\\" from Bullet for My Valentine's album The Poison in 2005. The group performed with Marta Jandov√° and represented Baden-W√ºrttemberg in the Bundesvision Song Contest 2005 with the song \\"Wie weit\\", placing 5th with 77 points. Mikko Sir√©n became an official band member in December 2005 having played around 200 shows with the band. Apocalyptica performing with Rammstein in Milan in 2005 Apocalyptica released their sixth studio album, Worlds Collide, on September 17, 2007. It was produced by Jacob Hellner. To the surprise of many, the album includes a remake of the German version of David Bowie's song \\"Heroes\\". Till Lindemann of Rammstein, for whom they opened on the Reise, Reise tour, was the guest vocalist on the track \\"Helden\\". Worlds Collide was released on April 15, 2008 in the United States. The first single, \\"I'm Not Jesus\\" featuring Corey Taylor of Slipknot and Stone Sour, cracked the top 10 of both the Active rock and Alternative rock charts. To end 2007, the band toured Europe, selling out many of the venues they played. In 2008 the tour continued in the United States and included numerous festivals in Europe. Eicca Toppinen 2018, With Full Force Paavo L√∂tj√∂nen 2018, With Full Force Perttu Kivilaakso 2018, With Full Force Antero Manninen 2018, With Full Force In June 2008, during the Rock in Rio concert in Lisbon, Apocalyptica joined the Greenpeace \\"energy [r]evolution campaign\\" and played the Beethoven 5th symphony from the stage. The band also appeared on Last Call with Carson Daly on October 31, 2008. Here they made their American television debut with a performance of \\"I Don't Care\\" with Toryn Green. In November 2008, Apocalyptica featuring Adam Gontier of Three Days Grace hit first at the BDS and Mediabase Active Rock radio charts with the single \\"I Don't Care\\". Later that month, the band ranked 3rd on Billboard's Hot Modern Rock Track chart and 2nd on Billboard's Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart just after AC/DC and just ahead of Metallica, an ironic twist since the band's origins lie in performing Metallica covers. Recently, it reached No. 1 on the Billboard rock chart, making Apocalyptica the first Finnish band to top the US charts. The song \\"I Don't Care\\" was also featured in the 16th episode of Season 8 of the TV series Smallville, which aired on March 19, 2009. The seventh Apocalyptica studio album entitled 7th Symphony, produced by Joe Barresi and Howard Benson, was released on August 23, 2010 in Europe (Germany on August 20, 2010),\\"Apocalyptica Set Release Date For 7th Symphony; First Single Announced \\" MetalFromFinland.com May 6, 2010. and August 24 in the U.S.\\"Apocalyptica Prepare for New album with U.S. Tour\\" PR Newswire May 7, 2010. The first single aired on radio June 29, 2010. The album features eight instrumentals plus four tracks with guest vocals. The first single, \\"End of Me\\", features Gavin Rossdale, vocalist from the British alternative rock band Bush, who had previously collaborated with the band. Slayer drummer Dave Lombardo played on \\"2010.\\" \\"Bring Them to Light\\" features Joseph Duplantier, singer and guitarist from the French death metal band Gojira. \\"Broken Pieces\\" is a collaboration with Flyleaf singer Lacey Mosley. \\"Not Strong Enough\\" was performed by Brent Smith, vocalist from (Shinedown). \\"Not Strong Enough\\" was re-recorded with Doug Robb of Hoobastank before being released to US radio on January 18, 2011 due to distribution rights.Apocalyptica Pulls Smith's Vocals For Single AlternativeAddiction.com. January 8, 2011. On October 7, 2011, RCA Music Group announced it was disbanding Jive Records along with Arista Records and J Records. With the shutdown, the band (and all other artists previously signed to these three labels) will release their future material on the RCA Records brand. Apocalyptica performed live with Metallica on three songs, \\"No Leaf Clover\\", \\"One\\" and \\"Seek & Destroy\\" in celebration of Metallica's 30th Anniversary on December 5, 2011. The band released an exclusive pledgers-only song \\"Solo Tu\\" featuring Erik Canales of Allison via fan-funding website Pledgemusic, as part of their Apocalyptica photo book project on October 28, 2011. Apocalyptica took a year off from touring and recording after concluding the 7th Symphony world tour in Beijing September 2012. During the break the band worked on a crossover musical and theatrical project titled Wagner Reloaded, combining Wagner's music with the sound of Apocalyptica, to celebrate German composer Richard Wagner's 200th birthday. There were two live performances in Wagner's birth town Leipzig, Germany on July 5 and 6, 2013. Eicca Toppinen arranged and composed the music for the production. The band released an album titled Wagner Reloaded-Live in Leipzig, in November 2013. Apocalyptica released \\"Psalm\\" on May 10, 2013. It was performed by Perttu Kivilaakso on their most recent tour. The band also announced a tour with Finnish Avanti! Chamber Orchestra, which premiered in March 2014. The set will consist solely of instrumentally performed Apocalyptica songs, especially arranged for the band and the 25-piece orchestra. Their eighth studio album, titled Shadowmaker, with Franky Perez singing on all vocal tracks, was released through Better Noise imprint of Eleven Seven Music on April 17, 2015. They also released a collaborative single with Vamps titled \\"Sin in Justice\\" on November 20. Apocalyptica made the music for the episode \\"On Finn Ice\\" of Rovio Entertainment's video game Angry Birds Seasons. Apocalyptica celebrated their 20th anniversary of the first album Plays Metallica by Four Cellos in 2016 and it was re-released with 3 brand new bonus tracks. The band toured with Antero Manninen, who returned after eight years to play on the tour. Following Manninen's departure from the band in late 2018, they brought in a new touring member, Lauri Kankkunen, the first cellist of the Helsinki Chamber Orchestra, to continue on the 20th anniversary tour in April 2019. In February 2019, the band released their first single with Finnish lyrics, featuring Sanni and Tippa. They performed the song at the 2019 Emma Gala in Helsinki. The band's ninth studio album, an instrumental, Cell-0 was released on January 10, 2020.

Currently the UK has no single official national day, although the Queen's Official Birthday is used for this purpose in some contexts. Overview Britain has no unique national day. It has a number of days of celebration which go largely uncelebrated, and others which are associated with the constituent countries of the United Kingdom. The latter category includes St George's Day in England, St Andrew's Day in Scotland, St David's Day in Wales and St Patrick's Day in Northern Ireland. At present, the Queen's Official Birthday is marked as a de facto national day by British diplomatic missions overseas but not in the UK itself. =Labour government= In June 2008, Immigration Minister Liam Byrne suggested the \\"August bank holiday\\" to be made a weekend of national celebration in a speech to Labour Party and think tank Progress. However, Scotland's August bank holiday is held on a different date from that in Wales and England. He later retracted this‚Äîafter pressure from the Scottish National Party (SNP) ‚Äì saying he was merely trying to \\"get the debate started\\". Angus Robertson MP and Westminster SNP group leader stated \\"Labour's cack-handed attempts to resuscitate a British 'national' identity are just desperate, motivated by self interest rather than national interest\\". In October 2008, in response to a question in the House of Commons from Andrew Rosindell, Minister of State Michael Wills of the Ministry of Justice revealed that \\"there are no plans to introduce a national day at the present time\\", leading to suggestions that the proposal had been 'scrapped'. Immediately thereafter, however, a Ministry of Justice spokesman confirmed that national day proposals were still \\"very much alive\\", adding that Wills had only meant that no plans had been drawn up at the present time. =Coalition government= In 2011, the coalition government composed of the Conservative Party and the Liberal Democrats proposed moving the May Day bank holiday in the United Kingdom to October, suggesting it be called 'UK Day' or be associated with Trafalgar Day. The removal of the May Day holiday was opposed by trade unions as a result of its associations with being an International Workers' Day. and by those who supported the continuance of an ancient folk tradition that may have existed since Anglo- Saxon times. Candidates for a new national day Most of the suggested proposals for a British Day are already existing holidays or days of celebration in the UK which either are poorly marked by the government and the people, or are not readily associated with the idea of Britishness at present. They include: * Brexit (31 Jan) The day the United Kingdom officially left the European Union in 2020. * 1 May, being both May Day and the date that the Acts of Union 1707 took effect. The existing May Day bank holiday sometimes falls on 1 May. * Union of the Crowns (24 March), to commemorate the kingdoms of England and Scotland sharing one monarch * Treaty of Union (1 May) A day dedicated to the unification of England, Scotland and Wales as one country and one kingdom. * VE Day (8 May) * Oak Apple Day (29 May), the date of the Restoration * D-Day (6 June) * Democracy Day (7 June) to remember the Reform Act 1832, also known as the Great Reform Act. * Battle of Waterloo (18 June), marking a decisive victory over Napoleon * St Alban's Day (22 June), marking the first saint martyred in the British Isles, St Alban. * The date of the signing of the Magna Carta (15 June) (a legal Charter for the Kingdom of England) * United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union (23 June) the date of the referendum. * The Queen's Official Birthday (a Saturday chosen in June). * Wilberforce Day (24 August) to remember the ending of slavery and the part played by William Wilberforce. * Battle of Hastings (14 October) Anniversary of the Battle of Hastings * Trafalgar Day (21 October) * Guy Fawkes Night (5 November) to commemorate the failure of a plot to blow up the houses of parliament * Armistice Day (11 November) * Remembrance Sunday (Sunday following Armistice Day). Opposition Celebrating St David's Day in Cardiff, 2007 On a report about a potential British Day, Peter Goldsmith, Baron Goldsmith said: :\\"There were undoubtedly issues raised about how a national day would be received in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. But the important point to stress in this regard is that there ought to be nothing in the framework of the national day to prevent particular areas from creating events that celebrate other shared identities alongside our bond of shared citizenship. People have multiple identities and it would be false for events organised for a national day not to be responsive to that.\\"at para. 40 In Wales, the proposed British Day has been criticised by Plaid Cymru and others. There have been repeated calls for St David's Day, the feast day of the patron saint of Wales, to be made a bank holiday. One poll found this idea to have the support of 87% of the Welsh public, and in the National Assembly for Wales all 60 members, representing Labour, Plaid Cymru, the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives, voted unanimously for it to be declared so. The UK government rejected the proposal on the grounds that it was not practical to introduce an additional public holiday. On 3 June 2008, the Deputy Leader of Plaid Cymru in the National Assembly for Wales, Alun Ffred Jones AM, said about the proposed British Day: :\\"This goes to prove how out of touch Labour is in Westminster. It's just another stunt to try and push Gordon Brown's agenda to make us all feel British instead of Welsh, Scottish, English or Northern Irish. While we don‚Äôt even have a bank holiday on our recognised national day in Wales, this London Labour government wants us to celebrate a special day that's being created to support their political goals. It would be far more constructive for the Westminster government to support Plaid Cymru's call for a national holiday on St David's day ‚Äì a national celebration that is already widely observed across the country.\\" This contrasts with other parts of the United Kingdom. St Patrick's Day has been a bank holiday in Northern Ireland since the enactment of the Bank Holiday (Ireland) Act 1903, and in 2007 the Scottish Parliament ‚Äì which has greater devolved powers than the Senedd ‚Äì passed the St Andrew's Day Bank Holiday (Scotland) Act 2007 which made St Andrew's Day a bank holiday in Scotland. Bank holidays in the United Kingdom do not entitle workers to a statutory holiday or extra pay on these days. British Day in Germany While the British themselves debate British Day, one has been held in Hamburg in Germany for many years (\\"British Day\\" 1991‚Äì2010, \\"British Flair\\" since 2011) with a full Proms with Union Flag waving, \\"Land of Hope and Glory\\" and \\"God Save the Queen\\", on 5 and 6 September 2009. The observance of British Day in Hamburg being in Germany goes back to the time of the House of Hanover of the 18th century, when a Hanoverian branch of the British royal family had the British crown. In Karlsruhe city hall hoists the flag of EU member countries on their national day. The UK flag was hoisted on 21 April, the actual birthday of Queen Elizabeth II.

It is one of the major red-light districts in Japan along with Kabukich≈ç, Tokyo, and Nakasu, Fukuoka. Currently, the district is congested with many restaurants, bars, hotels, and adult-entertainment establishments. Susukino is often noted as \\"ËñÑÈáé\\" in kanji, and \\"„Çπ„Çπ„Ç≠„Éé\\" in katakana, and directly translated as \\"zebra grass field\\". Name Various origins for the name Susukino are discussed, but the true origin is not definitely known. One theory is that the area currently known as Susukino was previously covered by Miscanthus sinensis (\\"Susuki\\" in Japanese). Another theory states that the Susukino is named after Tatsuyuki Usui, a supervisor in the construction of the red-light district in Sapporo (Usui is written as \\"ËñÑ‰∫ï\\" in kanji, and the letter \\"ËñÑ\\" refers to the Susuki in Japanese) .Susukino Tourist Association, top page Overview Susukino is not an official designation of any municipality. Rather, it is a commonly used name for a rough area with uncertain borders. Susukino Tourist Association defines the area of Susukino as lying between the roadways of Minami 4 and Minami 6 to the north and south, and from Nishi 2 chome to Nishi 6 chome to the east and west. The name Susukino is widely used in the names of landmarks, such as the Susukino Crossing, Susukino Station (a station of the Sapporo Street Car and Sapporo Municipal Subway). Area Susukino Crossing is located between Nishi 3 chome, Minami 4 and Nishi 4 chome, Minami 4, and many neon signs were installed on the buildings along the street. One of those signs is the Nikka sign at the front of the Susukino Building, which has a painting of the Nikka symbol, the King of Blenders,Nikka Official Website, about King of Blenders and the background whose colors are changed one after the other. Every September, the Hokkaid≈ç Marathon is held in Sapporo, and runners pass Ekimae D≈çri through the Susukino Crossing and Susukino district, which leads to the finish line in Nakajima Park.Hokkaid≈ç Marathon, the course outline Every August, the Susukino Festival is also held, and the line of people bearing Mikoshi parades down the street.Susukino Tourist Association, Susukino Festival The Ganso RƒÅmen Yokoch≈ç and Shin RƒÅmen Yokoch≈ç, where RƒÅmen restaurants are lined up along the pathway and visitors can have many types of the Sapporo RƒÅmen, are also located in the Susukino and are an attraction to sightseers. History Susukino Crossing to the East. Susukino originated in 1871, when the Hokkaid≈ç Kaitaku-shi, the Settlement Envoyship pioneering Hokkaid≈ç, designated the area from Minami 4 and Minami 5 to Nishi 3 chome and Nishi 4 chome as the red-light district. After the construction of the district, the Kaitaku-shi named this place as \\"Susukino Y≈´kaku\\" (Susukino red- light district), and integrated other brothels into this district. One of the reasons the Kaitaku-shi constructed a red-light district in this place was to keep laborers engaged in pioneering Hokkaid≈ç in Sapporo.Susukino Tourist Association, about Susukino In 1872, a 1.2 meter wall, 900 meters long, was erected around the Susukino Y≈´kaku and a gate was placed between Nishi 3 chome and Nishi 4 chome by Kaitaku-shi. In the fall of the same year, an act to emancipate prostitutes was announced by the new government, which had little influence on the district. With the establishment of licensed prostitution, Susukino Y≈´kaku and its surrounding area have smoothly thrived. In 1880, Susukino K≈çban (Susukino police box of the Sapporo Precinct) was placed in the Susukino. The transfer of Susukino Y≈´kaku to the neighbourhood of the Kamokamo River, headwaters of the Sousei River, was planned in 1901, in consideration of the elementary schools and women's professional schools that were located around the red-light district. The transfer, however, was not realised until the summer of 1920. Prior to this year, in 1918, the exposition of the 50th anniversary of Hokkaid≈ç was held in the Nakajima Park,The age of the Exposition in Hokkaido which was located close to the Susukino, and the Susukino Station of the Sapporo Street Car was also opened. Two years later, although the transfer of the red-light district was not carried out in time for the exposition, the district was moved to the place where Kikusui district in the Shiroishi-Ku, Sapporo, is currently located.Zuisou - the history of the Kikurui area After all the brothels in Susukino were removed, many restaurants, cafes, and movie theatres were constructed and popularized in their place. It was quiet during World War II, but the cabaret and dance hall were erected right after the War, and the American occupation troops also walked around the district. Susukino was not an Akasen (red-line) district, an area where prostitution was acknowledged by the government, but was actually an Aosen (blue-line) district, where a lot of restaurants and bars illegally promoted prostitution. The Prostitution Prevention Act was enacted in 1958,Houko.com, The Prostitution Prevention Act however, prostitution in Susukino did not disappear. The street stalls were the actual hotbed of the promotion of the prostitution, which were eradicated by their compulsory removal by the government in 1964. In the late 1960s, Sapporo City was reserved as the site of the 1972 Winter Olympics, and the expansion of the Sapporo Ekimae D≈çri (Sapporo Street in front of the station), the construction of the Sapporo Municipal Subway Nanboku-line, and the maintenance of the underground shopping arcade, Sapporo Poletown, were carried out in around 1970. In 1974, a department store, Matsuzakaya Sapporo Branch (currently Robbinson's Sapporo Branch) was opened, which was the first department store in the district of the Susukino. Other notable buildings included the \\"Emperor\\", a huge cabaret which opened in 1973 and later closed its business in September 2006, and the \\"Mikado\\", another large cabaret which opened in 1974 and later closed in the spring of 1982. Since the late 1970s, disco-style bars began to be popular in Japan and many discos were constructed in Susukino, while nightclubs decayed. In 1980s, a lot of hotels were constructed around the Susukino district. The Susukino Snow Festival (Susukino K≈çri no Saiten) was held as a part of the Sapporo Snow Festival in 1983, and since that year, ice statues and other snow objects line up the street of the Susukino district every February. In 1986, a natural hot spring was dug into the ground of Susukino. This was called \\"Susukino Hot Springs\\", and is used currently in hotels in the Susukino area. The H≈çsui Susukino Station, a subway station of the T≈çh≈ç line, Sapporo Municipal Subway, was inaugurated in 1988.

Drug addiction recovery groups are voluntary associations of people who share a common desire to overcome drug addiction. Different groups use different methods, ranging from completely secular to explicitly spiritual. Some programs may advocate a reduction in the use of illegal drugs rather than outright abstention, although this is typically not a sustainable treatment plan in the long term. One survey of members found active involvement in any addiction recovery group correlates with higher chances of maintaining sobriety. The survey found group participation increased when the individual members' beliefs matched those of their primary support group (often people will be members of multiple addiction recovery groups). Analysis of the survey results found a significant positive correlation between the religiosity of members and their participation in twelve-step addiction recovery groups and SMART Recovery, although the correlation factor was three times smaller for SMART Recovery than for the twelve-step addiction recovery groups. Religiosity was inversely related to participation in Secular Organizations for Sobriety. A survey of a cross-sectional sample of clinicians working in outpatient facilities (selected from the SAMHSA On-line Treatment Facility Locator) found that clinicians only referring clients to twelve-step groups for treatment were more likely than those referring their clients to twelve-step groups and \\"twelve-step alternatives\\" to believe less strongly in the effectiveness of Cognitive Behavioral and psychodynamic-oriented therapy, and were likely to be unfamiliar with twelve-step alternatives. A logistic regression of clinician's knowledge and awareness of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy effectiveness and preference for the twelve-step model was correlated with referring exclusively to twelve-step groups. Drug addiction recovery groups take the form of twelve- step programs and non-twelve-step programs.  Twelve-step recovery groups  The twelve-step program many groups follow are laid out in a twelve-step process. Participants attend meetings and are able to make new connections with other members who are striving towards a similar goal. If a person is unable to attend a meeting face-to-face, many of the groups have meetings by phone or online as another option. Each group has its own textbook, workbooks or both, which provide information about their program of recovery and instruction on how to work the steps. Often, free literature is available for anyone who asks for it at a meeting. This provides potential new members or family members with relevant information about both the addiction and that specific groups' version of the twelve-step process of recovery. New members are invited to work with another member who has already been through the twelve-steps at least once. That person serves as a guide to the new member, answers questions and provides feedback as the new member goes through the steps. These groups are spiritually based and encourage a belief in a power greater than the member. Most do not have one specific conception of what that means and allow the member to decide what spirituality means to them as it applies to their recovery. The groups emphasize living on a spiritual yet not necessarily religious basis. Groups typically advocate for complete abstinence, usually from all drugs including alcohol. This is because of the potential for cross-addiction, the tendency to trade one addiction for another. The following is a list of twelve-step drug addiction recovery groups. Most deal with substances such as drugs and alcohol rather than food or certain other behavioral addictions like sex or gambling. * Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) - This group gave birth to the twelve-step program of recovery. Meetings are focused on alcoholism only and advocate complete abstinence. Meetings are held all over the world. * Cocaine Anonymous (CA) - This group is focused on cessation of cocaine and all other mind-altering substances. The program advocates complete abstinence from all mind-altering substances in order to recover from the disease of addiction. Meetings are held all over the world. * Heroin Anonymous (HA) - This group is focused on abstinence from heroin along with all other drugs including alcohol. Meetings are held in England and the United States. * Crystal Meth Anonymous (CMA) - This group focuses on abstinence from crystal meth although it does recognize the potential for cross-addiction, the tendency for an addict to substitute one addiction for another.https://crystalmeth.org/for-the-fellowship/cma- literature/send/2-cma-literature/11-what-is-crystal-meth-anonymous.html Meetings are currently available in eight countries. * Marijuana Anonymous (MA) - This group focuses of recovery from marijuana addiction. Groups meet in eleven countries. * Nicotine Anonymous (NicA) - This group is for those desiring to stop the use of nicotine in all forms. Groups are available in many countries. * Narcotics Anonymous (NA) - This group has meetings in 139 countries and focuses on recovery from the use of all drugs and alcohol. The group makes no distinction between any mood or mind altering substance and encourages members to look for similarities the common problem they all share, rather than focusing on the differences.https://www.na.org/admin/include/spaw2/uploads/pdf/litfiles/us_english/IP/EN3122.pdf * Pills Anonymous (PA) - This group is focused on addiction to pills and all other mind-altering substances. Groups are available in seven countries. * Celebrate Recovery (CR) - Celebrate recovery is a recovery program for any life problem, including addiction to drugs and alcohol. The other groups allow for the new members to decide on what a higher power means to them. In celebrate recovery, the group recognizes Jesus Christ as their higher power. Their groups are located in the United States. * Pagans in Recovery (PIR) - Pagans in recovery has adapted the twelve step program of recovery into language that is not overtly Christian as it was originally written, so that those with other belief systems can more comfortably work the program. They have their own literature but do not currently have an official site for meeting availability.  Non-twelve-step recovery groups  These groups do not follow the twelve-step recovery method, although their members may also attend twelve-step meeting also. *Association of Recovering Motorcyclists (ARM) - The association of recovering motorcyclists is a brotherhood of men recovering from alcohol and/or drug addiction. They support one another in remaining abstinent from drugs and alcohol while continuing to ride motorcycles together regularly. It is an international organization and more information about membership can be found here *Recovering Women Riders (RWR) - Recovering women riders is a sisterhood of recovering women motorcyclists.

Holbrooks is a residential area of Coventry, West Midlands, England. Most of the length of the four brooks which pass through the area are covered or culverted, one culvert is adjacent to the recently built housing on Watery Lane. Another brook passes through and under the grounds of Parkgate School. The brooks then head off towards the river Sherbourne and the Sowe. Holbooks is situated some 3 mi (5 km) north-west to the city centre and was largely developed for private and council housing during the 1950s and to replace the many homes destroyed by air raids during the Second World War.  History  Much of the housing in Holbrooks was built between the wars, including council housing on and around Wheelwright Lane. Housebuilding continued after the war, with several small developments of private housing and larger council housing developments, notably the Everdon Road estate. Much of this land was previously farmland or for industrial use. The 'Stadium' housing estate at the rear of Lythalls Lane is so called because the housing was built on the site of a former dog racing stadium. In 1928 the Stadium speedway track opened. The track was closed in 1936 and the following year a greyhound track opened on the site This remained in use until 1964 when it was replaced by the housing. Children in Holbrooks now have fewer places to play as various pockets of land, once open spaces between development, are being swallowed up to in-fill, although Holbrooks Park, on Holbrook Lane, remains the area's largest open space.  Ricoh Arena  Holbrooks is close to the Ricoh Arena, (which was designed to have limited parking to promote bus travel and walking) a parking permit scheme is in place. The stadium, and the adjacent Arena Park Shopping Centre are served by Coventry Arena railway station, opened in 2016. The Arena is currently home to Coventry City FC and Wasps Rugby Union Club. It has hosted other sporting events including preliminary round football during the London 2012 Olympics (during which it was renamed the City of Coventry Stadium), and several music concerts. Notable acts who have played here include Bon Jovi 2008, Take That June 2009, and reformed Coventry bands The Specials and also The Enemy. Manchester band Oasis played the Ricoh during July 2009 and American act Pink, artist Alecia Moore played during 2010. The venue also includes a casino and large exhibition and conference centre.  Housing  Another notable social housing estate in Holbrooks is the area of Everdon Road. Built after the Second World War, and accessed from either Beake Avenue or Holbrook Lane, this is a more spacious well-designed housing estate with mostly three- and four-bedroom houses with large rooms and tall roofs. Also several one-bedroom bungalows with the same tall roof design. Due to the spacious layout of the estate, more bungalows were recently built as 'infill' and in the future more development is likely. There are a number of four storey residential flats on Everdon Road too, some have open views across parkland. The shape of the Everdon estate forms a complete loop and includes a small row of shops with flats above. Everdon is regularly used by learner drivers to practice, due to there being many corners, curves and reversing opportunity, plus the road is quiet during the school day. Most houses face onto grassed areas, and the estate is bordered by the large Holbrook Park which is maintained by Coventry City Council.  Today  Today Holbrooks has a diverse and large cultural mix which includes a large number of Polish people. There are two Polish food stores along Holbrook Lane, and several other food outlets and ethnic restaurants. The Arena Park Shopping Centre, on the Foleshill-Holbrooks border, features several national chain stores along with one of the largest Tesco stores in the country. A Morrisons store on Parkgate Road offers an alternative supermarket choice. The area's single surviving post office is located on Holbrook Lane. Holbooks Primary School is in the adjacent suburb of Foleshill. Schools for primary age (4‚Äì11) children in Holbrooks include Parkgate (one of the largest primary schools in Coventry), John Shelton Primary School, and Holy Family RC Primary School. Secondary education is provided at President Kennedy School in Rookery Lane. Holbrooks is also a short distance from the former British Coal Keresley Colliery site which is now a large industrial estate of warehousing called Prologis Park. The large wheel from the winding tower was cut into two, and placed on Prologis Park as a monument to the site's former activity. Current and former occupiers of ProLogis Park include GEFCO and Terex Benford, Tesco (warehousing), Co-op, Exel Bridgestone, Mastercare, DHL Exel Supply Chain, Richard Austin Alloys, Inkfish and Domestic & General. Prologis park covers some of land and includes a 'nature park' and arboreal area with two man-made lakes and some additional marshland where wildlife monitoring takes place. No fishing is allowed, and many species of bird use the habitat. Under the terrain of Holbrooks (and surrounding areas) are several mined coal seams at a depth ranging of 600‚Äì1,500 metres, these coal seams are known as the Warwickshire Thick, locally extracted to the pit head at Keresley from 1917 and until its eventual closure in 1991. The site was then used as a homefire plant until its complete closure in the year 2000. In 1939, at its peak, a million tons of coal was being extracted per year. Keresley coal was distributed via the railway line which still runs through Holbrooks and crosses Wheelwright Lane, the line was completed in 1919. Today, the line carries freight from Prologis Park, along the same route the coal had taken, crossing Wheelright Lane then running parallel with Winding House Lane, leaving Holbrooks over a cast iron bridge situated at Hen Lane, onwards toward Foleshill and towards Coventry. The coal mining and town gas industry was a major source of employment for Holbrooks and Binley areas of Coventry. Mining in the Midlands was undertaken on a neighbouring coal seam, extracted from Daw Mill. The mine was Britain's biggest coal producer. It closed in 2013 following a major fire. It was the last remaining colliery in the West Midlands. Today, Daw Mill along with the pit head at Keresley is just a memory.

He is the seventh Bishop of Brooklyn, having previously served as Bishop of Camden from 1999 to 2003. Life and career = Early life = Nicholas DiMarzio was born in Newark, New Jersey, to Nicholas Sr. and Grace (n√©e Grande) DiMarzio. His father served in the military at the time of his birth and later worked as a health inspector for the city of Newark. All four of his grandparents emigrated to the U.S. from southern Italy. He is the oldest of three children. DiMarzio grew up across the street from Sacred Heart Cathedral Basilica, Newark, and attended the cathedral's grammar school. He then went on to graduate from St. Benedict's Preparatory School in 1962. He attended Immaculate Conception Seminary, then at Darlington in Mahwah, Bergen County, New Jersey. He graduated with a bachelor's degree from Seton Hall University in 1966. He holds a Bachelor of Sacred Theology degree from The Catholic University of America (1970), a Master of Social Work from Fordham University (1980) and a doctorate in social work research and policy from Rutgers University, New Brunswick (1985). He is also a certified social worker and fluent in Italian and Spanish and proficient in French. = Ordination and ministry = DiMarzio was ordained to the priesthood for the Archdiocese of Newark on May 30, 1970, by Archbishop Thomas Boland. He began his ministry among migrants in 1976, where he served as the archdiocese's refugee resettlement director for nine years, during which time he also served a two- year term as director of the Office of Migration of Newark's Catholic Community Services, now Catholic Charities. He moved to Washington, D.C., in 1985, when appointed executive director for Migration and Refugee Services for the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and served there for six years. A year after arriving in Washington, he was named a prelate of honor by Pope John Paul II. While he served as executive director of Migration and Refugee Services, he also created the Catholic Legal Immigration Network known as CLINIC, a legal services corporation through which dioceses offer new immigrants help in resettling. He later served as its chairman for six years. When he returned to his home archdiocese in 1991, Archbishop Theodore McCarrick appointed him to be the associate executive director of Catholic Community Services and a year later was advanced to executive director, a position he held for five years. He also held the title of Vicar for Human Services, and vice president of the board of the archdiocesan Cathedral Healthcare Systems, overseeing its hospitals. = Auxiliary Bishop of Newark = In 1996, Pope John Paul II elevated him to the rank of auxiliary bishop for the Archdiocese of Newark. From 1998 until 2001 he chaired the Migration Committee of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. DiMarzio spent his diaconal year at Our Lady of Mount Carmel in Newark (1969-1970). He also served as an associate pastor at St. Nicholas Church, Jersey City, 1970‚Äì77; associate pastor in-residence at Holy Rosary Church, Jersey City, 1977‚Äì79; administrator and pastor of St. Boniface Church, Jersey City, 1979‚Äì80; chaplain of Holy Rosary Academy, Union City, 1980‚Äì84; pastor of Holy Rosary Church, Jersey City, 1984‚Äì85; associate pastor in-residence at Mount Carmel Church, Newark, 1985‚Äì88 and 1996; and pastor at Mount Carmel Church, Newark, 1996-99. In 2000, he was appointed a member of the Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerant People. = Bishop of Camden = DiMarzio was appointed the sixth Bishop of Camden, New Jersey, on June 8, 1999. While bishop there he established an Office of Ethnic Ministries, an Office of Black Catholic Ministry, and an Office of Hispanic Ministry. He also created an apostolate to the Haitian community and founded two missions to serve the Korean and Vietnamese communities. In 2000, DiMarzio established Mater Ecclesiae Chapel, the first canonically established mission owned by a diocese and staffed exclusively by diocesan priests to offer exclusively the Traditional Latin Mass.http://www.materecclesiae.org/about-mater-ecclesiae- church/ = Bishop of Brooklyn = On August 1, 2003, DiMarzio was named bishop of the Diocese of Brooklyn after four years as the bishop of the Diocese of Camden. He was installed in his new episcopal see at a Mass of Installation at the Basilica of Our Lady of Perpetual Help, Brooklyn, on October. 3, 2003. One of DiMarzio's first acts after his installation as Bishop of Brooklyn was to speak at the Immigrant Workers Freedom Ride Rally at Flushing Meadows Park. In November 2003 he spoke before Brooklyn's Muslim community at a Ramadan celebration and attended the Fifth World Congress of the Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerant People in Rome. Shortly after his installation as, DiMarzio was invited to be a member of the Global Commission on International Migration, sponsored by the Secretary-General of the United Nations and a number of governments. It began its work in December 2003 and concluded on December 31, 2005, after completing a report, entitled \\"Migration in an interconnected world; New directions for action\\". The bishop was the only U.S. resident on the 19-member commission. DiMarzio has issued three pastoral letters addressed to the parishioners of the Diocese of Brooklyn. The first, \\"The New Evangelization in Brooklyn and Queens\\", was presented in October 2004. The following October he wrote his second pastoral, entitled \\"The Family: The Hope of the New Evangelization\\". In October 2007, the Bishop issued his third pastoral letter: \\"Do Not Be Afraid - A Pastoral Vision for the New Evangelization\\". From 2004 to 2007, DiMarzio chaired the Domestic Policy Committee of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. During his tenure, the committee formulated \\"Forming Consciences for Faithful Citizenship\\", published in 2008, a call to political responsibility from the Catholic bishops of the U.S. It was approved by a historic number of bishops. He has also served as chairman of the Bishops' Migration Committee, and currently is a member of the board of directors of Catholic Relief Services and chairman of its finance committee, and a member of the Bishops' Task Force on Catholic Bishops and Politicians. DiMarzio's column of reflections on issues affecting the faithful, entitled \\"Put Out into the Deep\\" appears weekly in the diocesan newspaper, The Tablet. He also appears weekly on Currents, a daily Catholic television news program that airs on New Evangelization Television (NET) in a segment titled \\"Into the Deep\\", where he discusses diocesan, local, national and international news. On November 13, 2019, 56-year old Mark Matzek alleged that DiMarzio and a deceased priest, the Rev. Albert Mark, had repeatedly molested him while he was an altar boy at St. Nicholas Church and a student at St. Nicholas School in Jersey City in the mid-1970s, during which time DiMarzio was a parish priest. \\"In my nearly 50-year ministry as a priest, I have never engaged in unlawful or inappropriate behavior and I emphatically deny this allegation. I am confident I will be fully vindicated\\", DiMarzio said.  Views  = Abortion = DiMarzio has expressed his commitment to human life from the pulpit on many occasions. He also prays alongside Msgr. Philip Reilly, founder and executive director of Helper's of God's Precious Infants, on a routine basis, where he leads processions from area churches to local abortion clinics with hundreds of faithful to pray for an end to abortion. He also joined New York City religious leaders in January 2011 to call for new efforts to lower New York City's abortion rate. = Abuse scandal = DiMarzio visits with victims of clergy sexual abuse. In May 2009, he published a presentation to the people of the Diocese of Brooklyn entitled \\"From Shadow To Light And From Scandal To Healing: The Experience of the Diocese of Brooklyn with the Sex Abuse Scandal\\". The presentation was given so that the people of the diocese would have first-hand knowledge of what was being done in the diocese to assure protection of the youth and young adults from the scandal of abuse. It discussed investigating, reporting, responsibility of the Church, the Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People, accountability and reconciliation, prevention, victim assistance, the Safe Environment Office, effect on the laity, and youth in the Church. It also established a hotline, 1-888-634-4499, for anyone reporting suspected abuse. In October 2019, Pope Francis appointed DiMarzio to lead an investigation into the handling of sexual abuse claims in the Diocese of Buffalo, where Bishop Richard Joseph Malone was accused of mishandling allegations. = Religious freedom = In November 2009, DiMarzio signed an ecumenical statement known as the Manhattan Declaration, a manifesto that was issued by Catholic, Orthodox Christian and Protestant leaders, and which called on Christians not to comply with rules and laws permitting abortion, same-sex marriage and other social and moral matters that go against their religious consciences. It has been signed by more than 150 American religious leaders. = Immigration = DiMarzio is known as a forceful voice on behalf of migrants and immigrants and has worked for these causes through the majority of his priestly ministry, beginning as a young priest in Jersey City. When he was appointed by Pope John Paul II to the Diocese of Brooklyn, it was an appointment that expressed the Pope's recognition of Brooklyn's well-known status as a Diocese of Immigrants and DiMarzio's knowledge and expertise in responding to the needs of the migrant and immigrant communities. Because of his wide-ranging knowledge and experience in matters affecting migrants and immigrants, Bishop DiMarzio has testified frequently before committees of the U.S. House of Representatives. He has lobbied Congress for more lenient laws while serving as head of the United States Catholic Conference's Office of Migration and Refugee Services. = Vocations = The number of seminarians for the Diocese of Brooklyn has steadily increased since DiMarzio became a bishop, a reflection of his efforts and support for vocations. Statistics show that the number of seminarians increased from 39 in 2006-07 to 61 in 2010-11. He has worked with other dioceses and seminaries in the U.S. to receive seminarians from Haiti, Korea, Vietnam, and Poland to serve the \\"Diocese of Immigrants\\". DiMarzio requested each parish establish a Parish Vocation Committee (PVC) and as of May 2011, there are close to 140 PVC's in Brooklyn and Queens. He also celebrates an annual jubilee celebration of priests and men and women religious and holds twice a year gatherings with seminarians. Part of DiMarzio's efforts for vocations included establishing the John Paul II House of Discernment in April 2008 which serves as both a residence for seminarians and a location for discernment events, including discernment retreats. Other programs included in his support for vocations are Cathedral Preparatory Seminary, the Cathedral Seminary House of Formation, and the Vocation Office. DiMarzio ordained three bishops in a rare triple ordination.

Network virtualization is categorized as either external virtualization, combining many networks or parts of networks into a virtual unit, or internal virtualization, providing network-like functionality to software containers on a single network server. In software testing, software developers use network virtualization to test software which are under development in a simulation of the network environments in which the software is intended to operate. As a component of application performance engineering, network virtualization enables developers to emulate connections between applications, services, dependencies, and end users in a test environment without having to physically test the software on all possible hardware or system software. The validity of the test depends on the accuracy of the network virtualization in emulating real hardware and operating systems.  Components  Various equipment and software vendors offer network virtualization by combining any of the following: * Network hardware, such as switches and network adapters, also known as network interface cards (NICs) * Network elements, such as firewalls and load balancers * Networks, such as virtual LANs (VLANs) and containers such as virtual machines (VMs) * Network storage devices * Network machine-to-machine elements, such as telecommunications devices * Network mobile elements, such as laptop computers, tablet computers, and smart phones * Network media, such as Ethernet and Fibre Channel  External virtualization  External network virtualization combines or subdivides one or more local area networks (LANs) into virtual networks to improve a large network's or data center's efficiency. A virtual local area network (VLAN) and network switch comprise the key components. Using this technology, a system administrator can configure systems physically attached to the same local network into separate virtual networks. Conversely, an administrator can combine systems on separate local area networks (LANs) into a single VLAN spanning segments of a large network.  Internal virtualization  Internal network virtualization configures a single system with software containers, such as Xen hypervisor control programs, or pseudo-interfaces, such as a VNIC, to emulate a physical network with software. This can improve a single system's efficiency by isolating applications to separate containers or pseudo-interfaces.A. Galis, S. Clayman, A. Fischer, A. Paler, Y. Al-Hazmi, H. De Meer, A. Cheniour, O. Mornard, J. Patrick Gelas and L. Lefevre, et al. \\"Future Internet Management Platforms for Network Virtualisation and Service Clouds\\"- ServiceWave 2010, December 2010, http://servicewave.eu/2010/joint-demonstration-evening/ and in \\"Towards A Service-Based Internet\\" Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 2010, Volume 6481/2010, 235-237, = Examples = Citrix and Vyatta have built a virtual network protocol stack combining Vyatta's routing, firewall, and VPN functions with Citrix's Netscaler load balancer, branch repeater wide area network (WAN) optimization, and secure sockets layer VPN. OpenSolaris network virtualization provides a so-called \\"network in a box\\" (see OpenSolaris Network Virtualization and Resource Control). Microsoft Virtual Server uses virtual machines to make a \\"network in a box\\" for x86 systems. These containers can run different operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows or Linux, either associated with or independent of a specific network interface controller (NIC).  Use in testing  Network virtualization may be used in application development and testing to mimic real-world hardware and system software. In application performance engineering, network virtualization enables emulation of connections between applications, services, dependencies, and end users for software testing.  Wireless network virtualization  Wireless network virtualization can have a very broad scope ranging from spectrum sharing, infrastructure virtualization, to air interface virtualization. Similar to wired network virtualization, in which physical infrastructure owned by one or more providers can be shared among multiple service providers, wireless network virtualization needs the physical wireless infrastructure and radio resources to be abstracted and isolated to a number of virtual resources, which then can be offered to different service providers. In other words, virtualization, regardless of wired or wireless networks, can be considered as a process splitting the entire network system. However, the distinctive properties of the wireless environment, in terms of time-various channels, attenuation, mobility, broadcast, etc., make the problem more complicated. Furthermore, wireless network virtualization depends on specific access technologies, and wireless network contains much more access technologies compared to wired network virtualization and each access technology has its particular characteristics, which makes convergence, sharing and abstraction difficult to achieve. Therefore, it may be inaccurate to consider wireless network virtualization as a subset of network virtualization.  Performance  Until 1 Gbit/s networks, Network virtualization was not suffering from the overhead of the software layers or hypervisor layers providing the interconnects. With the rise of high bandwidth, 10 Gbit/s and beyond, the rates of packets exceed the capabilities of processing of the networking stacks. In order to keep offering high throughput processing, some combinations of software and hardware helpers are deployed in the so-called \\"network in a box\\" associated with either a hardware dependent network interface controller (NIC) using SRIOV extensions of the hypervisor or either using a fast path technology between the NIC and the payloads (virtual machines or containers). For example, in case of Openstack, network is provided by Neutron which leverages many features from the Linux kernel for networking: iptables, iproute2, L2 bridge, L3 routing or OVS. Since the Linux kernel cannot sustain the 10G packet rate, then some bypass technologies for a fast path are used. The main bypass technologies are either based on a limited set of features such as Open vSwitch (OVS) with its DPDK user space implementation or based on a full feature and offload of Linux processing such as 6WIND Virtual Accelerator.

They were the first company to introduce forensic and consumer genomics products, which were developed immediately upon the publication of the first complete draft of the human genome in the early 2000s. They researched, developed, and marketed the first ever consumer genomics product, based on \\"Ancestry Informative Markers\\" which they used to correctly identify the BioGeographical Ancestry (BGA) of a human based on a sample of their DNA. They also researched, developed and marketed the first ever forensic genomics product - DNAWITNESS - which was used to create a physical profile of donors of crime scene DNA. The company reached a peak of roughly $3M/year revenues but ceased operations in February 2009.The Genetic Genealogist  DNAPrint Genomics Ceases Operations GenomeWeb Daily News  GenomeWeb Consumer applications DNAPrint Genomics' flagship product was \\"AncestryByDNA\\", a DNA test for its consumers that breaks down the percentage ancestry of a client, based on Ancestry Informative Markers (SNP polymorphisms) their DNA. AncestryByDNA was a historical product, representing the first consumer genomics product ever developed and marketed in the US and probably world-wide. It was marketed as a tool for personal genealogical research, and for adoptees looking to learn more about their genealogy. Forensic applications DNAPrint's most controversial offering was \\"DNAWitness\\", a product that uses the same Ancestry Informative Markers for a forensic purpose, as well as polymorphisms in the human OCA2 gene and others to make inference about iris (eye), hair and skin color. DNAPrint was the first to research and publish the linkages between OCA2 polymorphisms and human eye color and by integrating these with the same ancestry informative markers used with its consumer BGA tests for analysis with DNA evidence from crime scenes, DNAPrint Genomics was able to help narrow down suspects based on the construction of an \\"in-silco constructed, database driven\\" physical trait or phenotype profile Alt URL . In 2006, Scotland Yard and London's Metropolitan Police announced that they would be investigating the use of DNAWitness to narrow suspects in the search for a long-standing effort to capture a serial rapist known as the Minstead Rapist. DNAWitness was used in 2007 to help narrow down suspects in the investigation into the 2002 murder of Pam Kinamore. Though the police dragnet was initially looking for white suspects based on an early eyewitness, DNAPrint Genomics was later contracted to test the DNA sample, and concluded that the suspect was of \\"substantial African ancestry\\". Investigators redirected their investigation to focus on individuals fitting this description and shortly thereafter identified Derrick Todd Lee who was subsequently convicted of the crime as well as a series of other similar murders in the Baton Rouge Louisiana area. This application of \\"Forensic Phenotyping\\", where physical characteristics were inferred from crime scene DNA and used to redirect, and help solve a crime, was covered by New York Times, Wired Magazine, Popular Science, US News and World Report, Sarasota Herald Tribune, ABC and CBS Evening News programs, Australian and German News programs and in a Forensic Files episode entitled \\"Tight Fitting Genes\\" as a historical first. Since the Lee case, the product was used on dozens of other serial homicide cases with successful results, including a case out of Napa Valley where the suspect saw a Forensic Files show (\\"Good as Gold, Season 12, Episode 15) on his murder where his \\"in silico\\" genetic portrait was a dead-ringer, and in a panic, turned himself in . Historical Relevance In the early 2000s, under the leadership of founder and then CEO Tony N. Frudakis, Ph.D., DNAPrint forged a nascent consumer genetics/genomics and forensic phenotyping marketplace. In the mid to late 2000s many journalists and academics harshly criticized DNAPrint's application of genomics research for consumer and forensic purposes but by the early 2000-teens, the forensic science applications of BioGeographical Ancestry (BGA) admixture analysis for the inference of BGA and certain anthropometric phenotypes such as skin shade, eye/hair color, had become well established and by 2019 the market for these types of products had grown to over $500M/year in size. As of 2019, various capillary electrophoresis (e.g. Applied Biosystems) and next generation sequencing platform and consumable manufacturers have introduced human identity products combining classical (CODIS eligible) STR profiling marker sets with unique SNP based AIMS for the inference of BGA and phenotype (e.g. ForenSeq, from Illumina's Verogen). Various private and public laboratories had also emerged to provide forensic phenotyping services (e.g. Parabon Nanolabs). In the mid-2000s, Dr. Frudakis wrote the seminal textbook introducing the forensic and consumer market application of genome-derived marker panels. In the mid-to late 2000s, before it had fully developed these new markets, the hedge fund supporting DNAPrint liquidated the company and sold its intellectual property and know-how to DNA Diagnostics Company (DDC). Just prior to the company's liquidation, other companies launched similar products in the consumer genomic genealogy market (e.g. 23andMe and Ancestry.com). By 2018, these companies had extended the science significantly, building even larger genomic databases and enabling finer level and even entirely new inferences. For example, in forensics, over 70 serial homicide cases (including the Golden State Killer) having been solved through genetic genealogy hits enabled by the types of consumer genomics databases DNAPrint was the first to introduce. In these cases, potential relatives of individuals that donated DNA to crime scenes are identified. With consumer genealogy, family members can now be identified and reconnected through database matching, and customers can now pinpoint even intracontinental and regional family origins using the types of consumer genomics databases DNAPrint was the first to introduce.

Easter Greenock Castle was a castle of unknown design near the burgh of Greenock, Scotland. Built sometime in the mid-sixteenth century, the castle formed the centre of the lands and estates of Cartsburn and Easter Greenock. These belonged to the Crawfords of Kilbirnie in Ayrshire who acquired them during the reign of Mary, Queen of Scots. Cartsburn extends from the Carts Burn on the west along the River Clyde to the point where the boundary falls out at Old Clyde Forge. The lands of Cartsburnhttp://www.cartsburn.com were originally part of the barony of Kilbirnie and became the patrimony of a younger brother of that family, whose posterity ended in the person of David Crawford of Cartsburn in the reign of Charles I. By the mid- seventeenth century the lands of Cartsburn and Cartsdyke belonged to John Crawford of Kilbirnie who in 1641, because of his distinguished services to the Crown during the early years of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms (1638 to 1651), was made a baronet by Charles I. He died in 1662 and left two daughters by his second wife Magdalen, daughter of Lord Carnegie, named Anne and Margaret. Anne married Sir Archibald Stewart of Blackhall the first baronet, while Margaret became the wife of Patrick Lindsay, second son of the Earl of Crawford. The lands were entailed on Margaret and her male heirs, who had to assume the name of Crawfurd with the family arms. A charter of confirmation, dated 29 June 1663, in favour of Margaret Crawford of the lands and barony of Kilbirnie (granted by her father Sir John Crawford of Kilbirnie in 1662) including the 40 shilling land of the old extent of Cartsburn with buildings and fishings and free entry to and exit from the moor and marsh of Greenock, with the mill lands of Greenock in the barony of the same. Under this document Margaret and her heirs could sell and dispose of the lands of Easter Greenock and Cartsburn. In 1669, Margaret Crawford, by now Lady Kilbirnie, with the consent of her husband sold the lands of Easter Greenock to Sir John Schaw of Wester Greenock to whom was granted in 1670 a Crown Charter containing a clause by which Easter and Wester Greenock were to be united into a single barony, later called the Burgh of the Barony of Greenock. However, the disposition reserved the right to Cartsburn, which Lady Kilburnie afterwards conveyed to her cousin Thomas Crawfurd of Cartsburn, second son of Cornelius Crawford of Jordanhill, later the first Baron. The writs of the Forty-shilling lands of Cartsburn dating between 1628 and 1656, which were sold by Margaret Crawford, Lady Kilbirney, and her husband Mr Patrick Lindsay to Thomas Crawford of Cartsburn in 1678, are still extant and can be consulted in the National Archives of Scotland in Edinburgh. The place name Cartsdyke may be derived from Crawford‚Äôs Dyke, which was named after John Crawford of Easter Greenock who built a quay wall or dyke at Greenock in the middle of the sixteenth century. Cartsburn was erected into a barony, and a burgh of barony with the privilege of a weekly market and several fairs, in favour of Thomas Crawfurd of Cartsburn, 1st Baron of Cartsburn by a charter of Charles II dated 16 July 1669. To the south of Crawfordsdyke lay the House of Cartsburn, the principal messuage of that barony and seat of the Crawfords of Cartsburn. The earliest account of Cartsburn is in Hamilton of Wishaw‚Äôs Accompt of the Sheriffdom of Renfrew published in 1710. He wrote \\"The town is mostly sub-feud to merchants, seamen, or loading-men, who have built very good houses in it, and it is a very thriving place\\". The Scots Magazine reported in 1809 that \\"the tower has... fallen, and in the course of a few years the plough will probably pass over the remains\\". However the Industrial Revolution, rather than the agricultural past, finally finished off the castle. The ruins stood in the path of the railway, and were demolished in the 1830s. The site of the castle's location today is commemorated as Castle Road, now the only indication of Easter Greenock above ground.

The last official commercial navigation of the canal took place in 1955. Public transport Bus √âireann route 448 provides a link to Mullingar on Fridays only departing at 10.15 and returning from Mullingar at 13.30. The nearest railway station is Mullingar railway station approximately 15 kilometres distant. Until August 2013, Bus √âireann route 118 (Dublin-Mullingar-Longford) served Ballynacargy on Saturdays only allowing passengers to travel into Longford for a few hours.http://buseireann.ie/news.php?id=1351&month;=Aughttp://www.buseireann.ie/inner.php?id=247#Westmeath History Ballynacargy is thought to have been largely established in the mid 18th century by the Malone family of Baronstown, who intended to create a linen industry in the area. While the linen trade failed to thrive, the village gained a harbour on the Royal Canal which opened in 1817, and developed as a market serving the surrounding district. However, the origins of the village go back much further, and its immediate area includes some of the most important historical and archaeological sites in Westmeath. The first recorded reference dates from 1537 after the dissolution of the nearby monastery at Tristernagh Abbey. =Kilbixy= It is thought that the village of Ballynacargy initially grew as a result of the decline of nearby Kilbixy, an important town in Meath 500 years ago. Kilbixy (from the Irish Cill Bigsighe) developed around an early Christian church reputedly founded by Saint Bigseach, a handmaiden of Saint Brigid whose feast day was celebrated on June 28 and October 4. A castle was built here by Walter de Lacy in 1192, following which a Norman settlement grew up and was granted Borough rights. Kilbixy was said to have once had twelve burgesses and a mayor,Casey and Rowan The Buildings of Ireland: North Leinster, p.346 along with the castle, church, a market and a dock on the shore of Lough Iron, but declined and was deserted during the 15th century after being repeatedly attacked and burned, first in 1430 by Owen O'Neill, King of Tyrone, and then by the locally powerful Geoghegan family.Woods, Annals of Westmeath, 1907, p.290 By the 17th century only a few ruins remained of the former town. Despite the town's disappearance, the parish still bears the name of Kilbixy. The Church of Ireland parish church, dedicated to St Bigseach, is located within the former area of Kilbixy town itself, in Baronstown Demesne townland to the north of Ballynacargy village. It was built, probably on the same site as Kilbixy's original church, in 1798 to the designs of James Wyatt, one of the greatest architects of the time: the area around it remains one of the best-preserved examples of a deserted medieval borough in Ireland.St Bigseach's Church of Ireland, Buildings of Ireland In 1980 a 7th-century stone was discovered in the circular churchyard, showing it to have been a very early foundation.Ambitious Plans to Restore 5th century Kilbixy Church, 'Westmeath Examiner, 22-09-10 The 1798 church was funded by The 1st Baron Sunderlin, and is a good example of a church of the period sited to provide a picturesque landscape view from the local big house.Howley, The Follies and Garden Buildings of Ireland, 2004, p.171 Lord Sunderlin also built a large mausoleum next to the church: Sunderlin's brother, the celebrated Shakespearean scholar Edmond Malone, is also buried there. In the 19th century, St Bigseach's churchyard still remained a favoured place of interment for local Catholic families, as well as Anglicans.O'Hanlon, Lives of the Irish Saints, vol X, p.44 There is a holy well, Tobar Bigsighe (\\"the well of Bigseach\\") nearby. =Templecross= Northeast of the village in the townland of Tristernagh Demesne are the ruins of Templecross Church, from where the ruins of Tristernagh Abbey are visible. Templecross is probably late-medieval in date, with a west tower built in c. 1575.Templecross Church, County Westmeath, Buildings of Ireland Within the church is the tomb of the landowner Henry Piers (1568-1623), who after embracing Catholicism and travelling widely in Europe, restored the Abbey buildings and church: at the tomb's foot was a memorial to Gerald Farrell and his wife Elizabeth, who had been foster parents of Sir Henry Piers, 1st Baronet.Association for Preservation of Memorials of the Dead, Ireland, Journal for 1901, Vol 5, 1, 119 By the late 17th century the building had been converted to a Protestant church, as the main church at Kilbixy was then derelict. Templecross churchyard contains a number of historic monuments: there are several to 19th century Catholic priests who served Ballinacargy, including the Rev. John Cantwell, PP, who was well known locally for his work with the poor and his promotion of education.Woods, 1907, p.311 The base of an early stone cross is also located in the churchyard. A lane known locally as B√≥ithr√≠n na marbh (\\"little road of the dead\\") once ran from the north side of the churchyard to Ballynacroghy or Gallowstown townland.Ballynacargy, National Folklore Collection, UCD =Tristernagh Abbey= The house of Augustinian canons, also known as the Priory of Kilbixy, was founded in 1192 by Geoffrey de Constantine. Attached to the monastery was a leper hospital, a rarity by that time. The priory achieved some fame from its establishment until 1536 when the commissioners of the English King Henry VIII ransacked and destroyed it.

In addition, there are several \\"suspension\\" facilities ( Mitkan Hashhaya) run by the IDF's Military Police Corps, subordinate to their respective regional brigades, which complement the incarceration facilities and hold Palestinian detainees for a short period before they are sorted and moved to an incarceration facility run by the Israel Prison Service. History The need for detention centers to hold large numbers of Palestinian detainees in Israel arose during the First Intifada. Beginning in 1988, the IDF built and expanded several such facilities adjacent to existing infrastructures at Megiddo Prison, Camp Ktzi'ot (Nitzana) and Camp Ofer. A small incarceration facility was also opened to the north of the Gaza Strip, near the Erez Crossing, as well as several facilities in the West Bank: Shomron, Etzion, Efraim, Menashe (Salem), Binyamin, etc. Most of the above were closed following the Oslo Accords, although Megiddo and Ktzi'ot Prisons continued to operate with a smaller staff. The prisons were re-opened in 2002, following the start of the Al-Aqsa Intifada and Operation Defensive Shield. In 2006 reorganization of the prison system began, during which several facilities were closed and others facilities reassigned from IDF to Israel Prison Service (IPS) authority. As of 2006, all three incarceration facilities are operational and are subordinate to the IPS, while the two remaining detention facilities (Shomron and Etzion) are controlled by the IDF. Incarceration facilities There are currently three incarceration facilities: *Ktzi'ot Prison ‚Äì by far the largest facility, it is located in the Ktzi'ot area, near Nitzana and the border crossing with Egypt. It can contain approximately 2,200 Palestinian prisoners, and over 3,500 during an emergency. *Megiddo Prison ‚Äì the oldest such facility and the first to move to IPS control from the IDF. Megiddo Prison can contain up to 1,200 prisoners. *Ofer Prison ‚Äì the smallest of the three, it is located near Ramallah and is therefore the closest location to where most of the prisoners in question are detained. Ofer Prison can contain up to 800 prisoners. *Saharonim Prison is an Israeli detention facility for African asylum seekers located in the Negev desert.

It also includes the ability of a private person to violate a law without punishment where the violation of law was necessary to prevent even worse harm. The maxim on which the doctrine is based originated in the writings of the medieval jurist Henry de Bracton, and similar justifications for this kind of extra-legal action have been advanced by more recent legal authorities, including William Blackstone. In modern times, the doctrine was first used in a controversial 1954 judgment in which Pakistani Chief Justice Muhammad Munir validated the extra-constitutional use of emergency powers by Governor General, Ghulam Mohammad. In his judgment, the Chief Justice cited Bracton's maxim, 'that which is otherwise not lawful is made lawful by necessity', thereby providing the label that would come to be attached to the judgment and the doctrine that it was establishing. The doctrine of necessity has since been applied in a number of Commonwealth countries, and in 2010 was invoked to justify extra- legal actions in Nigeria. Pakistan, 1954: First use On 24 October 1954 the Governor-General of Pakistan, Ghulam Mohammad, dissolved the Constituent Assembly and appointed a new Council of Ministers on the grounds that the existing one no longer represented the people of Pakistan. Stanley de Smith argues that the real reason for the dissolution was because Mohammad objected to the constitution which the Assembly was about to adopt.Wolf-Phillips, Leslie. \\"Constitutional Legitimacy: A Study of the Doctrine of Necessity.\\" Third World Quarterly, Vol. 1, No. 4 (October 1979) 98. The President of the Constituent Assembly, Maulvi Tamizuddin, appealed to the Chief Court of Sind at Karachi to restrain the new Council of Ministers from implementing the dissolution and to determine the validity of the appointment of the new Council under Section 223-A of the constitution. In response, members of the new Council of Ministers appealed to the court saying that it had no jurisdiction to approve the request of the President to overturn the dissolution and appointments. They argued that Section 223-A of the constitution had never been validly enacted into the Constitution because it was never approved of by the Governor-General, and therefore anything submitted under it was invalid. The Chief Court of Sind ruled in favour of President Tamizuddin and held that the Governor-General's approval was not needed when the Constituent Assembly was acting only as a Constituent Assembly and not as the Federal Legislature.Judgement and Order of the Chief Court of Sind at Karachi, 9 February 1955, PLD 1955 Sind 96. The Federation of Pakistan and the new Council of Ministers then appealed to the court, the appeal was heard in March 1955 (Federation of Pakistan v Maulvi Tamizuddin Khan). In the appeal hearing under Chief Justice Muhammad Munir, the court decided that the Constituent Assembly functioned as the 'Legislature of the Domain' and that the Governor-General's assent was necessary for all legislation to become law. Therefore, the Chief Court of Sind had no jurisdiction to overturn the Governor General's dissolution and it was held as valid. However, the ground of which the court found in favour of the Federation of Pakistan called into question the validity of all legislation passed by the Assembly, not to mention the unconstitutionality of the Assembly itself since 1950. To solve this problem, the Governor-General invoked Emergency Powers to retrospectively validate the Acts of the Constituent Assembly. An appeal was filed against the Governor-General for invoking emergency powers and the Chief Justice had to determine the constitutionality of invoking the Emergency Powers and whether the Governor-General could give his assent to legislation retroactively.Wolf- Phillips, Leslie. \\"Constitutional Legitimacy: A Study of the Doctrine of Necessity.\\" Third World Quarterly, Vol. 1, No. 4 (October 1979) 99. The Court held that in this case the Governor-General could not invoke emergency powers because in doing so he validated certain laws that had been invalid because he had not assented to them previously. Justice Munir also ruled that constitutional legislation could not be validated by the Governor General but had to be approved by the Legislature. The lack of a Constituent Assembly did not transfer the Legislature's powers over to the Governor-General. The Court was referred to for an opinion. On 16 May 1955 it ruled: # The Governor General in certain circumstances had the power to dissolve the Constituent Assembly. # The Governor-General has during the interim period the power 'under the common law of civil or state necessity' of retrospectively validating the laws listed in the Schedule to the Emergency Powers ordinance. # The new Assembly (formed under the Constituent Convention Order 1955) would be valid and able to exercise all powers under the Indian Independence Act 1947.PLD 1955 I FC 561-5 In his verdict, Munir declared it was necessary to go beyond the constitution to what he claimed was the Common Law, to general legal maxims, and to English historical precedent. He relied on Bracton's maxim, 'that which is otherwise not lawful is made lawful by necessity', and the Roman law maxim urged by Ivor Jennings, 'the well-being of the people is the supreme law'. Grenada, 1985: Second use In a 1985 judgment, the Chief Justice of the High Court of Grenada invoked the doctrine of necessity to validate the legal existence of a court then trying for murder the persons who had conducted a coup against former leader Maurice Bishop. The court had been established under an unconstitutional \\"People's Law\\" following the overthrow of the country's constitution, which had subsequently been restored. The defendants argued that the court before which they were being tried had no legal existence under the restored constitution, and they were therefore being deprived of their constitutional right to a trial before a \\"Court established by law\\". The High Court acknowledged that the lower court \\"had come into existence in an unconstitutional manner\\", but \\"the doctrine of necessity validated its acts.\\"H.V. Evatt and Eugene Forsey, Evatt and Forsey on the Reserve Powers. (Sydney: Legal Books, 1990), p. xciv. On this basis, the murder trials were allowed to proceed. Nigeria, 2010: Nigerian parliament creates an Acting President A related (although non-judicial) use of the doctrine took place when, on 9 February 2010, the Nigerian National Assembly passed a resolution making Vice President Goodluck Jonathan the Acting President and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces. Both chambers of the Assembly passed the resolution after President Umaru Yar'Adua, who for 78 days had been in Saudi Arabia receiving medical treatment, was unable to formally empower the vice president to exercise full powers as acting president, as provided for in Section 145 of the country's constitution. No provision of the Nigerian constitution empowering the National Assembly to pass any such resolution, causing Senate President David Mark to assert that the Senate had been guided by the \\"doctrine of necessity\\" in arriving at its decision. Private parties Necessity is a defense to violating a law where the violation was done in order to stop or prevent worse harm. For example, a person must have a license to operate a motor vehicle. However, if a person was requiring immediate medical attention and the only person who could drive them to the hospital did not have a license, it would be permissible for them to drive the sick person to the hospital.

Russell launched his career as an independent candidate on a platform for a professional city management, and joined the bi-partisan coalition that was established to elect Walter J. Sullivan as mayor. Russell remained in alliance with Sullivan and in opposition to the anti-patronage and academic- aligned Cambridge Civic Association for most of his tenure, although eventually Sullivan sided with the CCA. Russell was elected mayor of Cambridge in January 1984; it was his fourth attempt for a mayor's seat. At first, the city council was split, with incumbent Alfred Vellucci and three other candidates, including Russell, competing for the job; media predicted a protracted campaign like that of 1948, when it took 43 weeks to elect a candidate. Russell, this time in alliance with liberal council members, nevertheless was elected after only four weeks of debate. He was immediately involved into clashes around the firing of long-term School Superintendent William Lannon, accused of political patronage but supported by the parents; the situation temporarily defused only in the end of October and was followed by a work-to-rule action by schoolteachers in November. He also had to moderate local campaign against nerve gas testing at Arthur D. Little.Arthur D. Little of 1984 is related to a current company of the same name only though this name. The original ADL was liquidated in 2002. In another controversial move, Russell spoke to \\"stop the expansion of MIT and Harvard into Cambridge's neighborhoods\\" and intervened against Harvard University plans, declaring his intention to take the property owned by Harvard on eminent domain terms and redevelop it into low-income public housing. Russell himself, speaking on the first anniversary of mayoral election, claimed local ordinances on human rights and on suppression of smokers to be his most important achievements of this year. The controversial smoking ordinance, enacted in July 1984, banned tobacco smoking in restaurants, except for specially designated smoking areas. Russell said, \\"I was in favor because people should be able to go out and enjoy a meal without being disturbed by others smoking\\". After his death media disclosed that Russell was already fighting cancer when elected mayor. Shortly after his death, the state of Massachusetts renamed Huron Avenue Bridge after Russell. Harvard University established six, now (2009) three Leonard Russell scholarships for local municipal employees.

The Panama Bight extends eastwards from the Azuero Peninsula in Panama along the coast of the Gulf of Panama and Archipelago de las Perlas. It continues south along the entire Pacific coast of Colombia to the coast of northern Ecuador. The Nicoya marine ecoregion bounds it on the north, and the Guayaquil marine ecoregion bounds it on the south. The Panama Bight ecoregion is home to rich coral beds in the near shore waters. While coral diversity is lower here than in the Caribbean Sea on the other side of Panama, the coral cover tends to be higher. In fact, the density of coral coverage here-90 percent coverage is common-is rarely seen in the Caribbean. In addition to the coral beds, enclaves of Panama Bight mangroves can be found in the tidal zone. Threats El Ni√±o climate events have warmed the water of this ecoregion, which has led to bleached and killed coral. Outbreaks of the crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci) have also reduced coral populations. Siltation from soil erosion has destroyed many coral areas. Additionally threats include deforestation on shore and destruction of the reefs due to fishing, as well as damage from domestic pollution, dam construction, mining, oil shipping, and pesticides. The Panama Bight ecoregion is one of the World Wildlife Fund's Global 200 priority ecoregions for conservation. References * Spalding, Mark D., Helen E. Fox, Gerald R.

St. Paul's School for Girls (grades 5-12) is an independent college-preparatory school in Brooklandville, Maryland, founded in 1959 to replace an older girls' school which had been closed. St. Paul's School for Girls shares a campus with St. Paul's School (all boys, grades 5-12), founded in 1849, and with St. Paul's Pre and Lower School (coed, six weeks through grade 4). In July 2018, the schools unified under the umbrella of The St. Paul's Schools, with a single board of trustees and one president, but each school retains its individual traditions and its gender-specific programs.  Location  The school is situated on a rural campus in the Green Spring Valley, about ten miles (16 km) north of the city of Baltimore.  History  The girls' school traces its roots to 1799 when the Benevolent Society of the City and County of Baltimore, founded by a group of parishioners from Old St. Paul's Church, established an institution for the care and education of indigent or orphaned girls. During the 1800s and 1900s, the school closed and reopened several times with different names and in different locations. In 1958, members of the Benevolent Society voted to establish a new college-preparatory school, which opened officially in 1959 (on a site adjacent to St. Paul's School for Boys). The school's signature academic programs including SPIRITUS Scholars, a two-year exploratory program for juniors and seniors. The school was approved for international students under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program in 2003. The school was designated a Green School in September 2007 by the Maryland Association for Environmental and Outdoor Education.

Despite unspecified developmental disabilities, Hutmaker had an outgoing demeanor and an engaging personality and was given the honorary title of \\"roving ambassador\\" for the city of Excelsior. It was in this capacity that Hutmaker spent his days and nights wandering the streets of the city, chewing on a cigar, mumbling to himself, and greeting locals by name. Someone paid for business cards with this title for Mister Jimmy, and he carried them for the rest of his life. It is reported that he knew most Excelsior natives and their children by name, and also knew what churches they attended and their family history. Local businesspeople provided for Hutmaker's needs, providing free meals and welcoming him in from the elements year round. However he was not a vagrant; he lived in his family home for most of his life, and until 2004 was cared for by his brother Ralph. After Ralph's death the burden of Jimmy's care was picked up by unrelated townspeople. He needed an escort to get out of the Excelsior nursing home he lived in, and residents of Excelsior stepped in and took him out daily.

Background Bred in Florida by Waldemar Farms, he was sired by leading American sire What A Pleasure, out of the mare Tularia, whose sire, Tulyar, was owned and bred by The Aga Khan IV and was a stakes winner in Ireland and England. He was purchased at the Saratoga yearling sales for $45,000 by Bertram and Diana Firestone in 1974. He was trained by Hall of Fame trainer LeRoy Jolley, Racing career Honest Pleasure was a precocious two- year-old and dominated his division. Headstrong like his grandsire, Bold Ruler, he liked to run in front and easily won the Champagne Stakes, Laurel Futurity Stakes, Arlington-Washington Futurity Stakes, and the Cowdin Stakes. At the end of the year, he was named American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt. 1976 brought a rival in Bold Forbes, another colt with a similar ancestry in grandsire Bold Ruler and running style. Bold Forbes had raced mostly in Puerto Rico as a two-year-old but challenged Honest Pleasure at three. Honest Pleasure won the Flamingo Stakes by 11 lengths in February, and went on to win the Florida Derby and the Blue Grass Stakes as the favorite. In the Kentucky Derby Jolley had Honest Pleasure sit off the pace and but he made his move too late and was beaten to the wire by Bold Forbes. In the Preakness, Honest Pleasure and Bold Forbes went to the lead and dueled through 6 furlongs in 1:09, only to lose to Elocutionist, with Honest Pleasure placing a poor fifth. He did not enter the Belmont Stakes, leaving it to Bold Forbes who narrowly won. Honest Pleasure rebounded with victory in the Travers in a stakes record time of 2:00 1/5 for 1 1/4 miles, which was broken by General Assembly in 1979 with a time of 2:00 flat, a record only broken in 2016 by Arrogate.

The characteristic function of any infinitely divisible distribution is then called an infinitely divisible characteristic function.Lukacs, E. (1970) Characteristic Functions, Griffin , London. p. 107 More rigorously, the probability distribution F is infinitely divisible if, for every positive integer n, there exist n independent identically distributed random variables Xn1, ..., Xnn whose sum Sn = Xn1 \\\\+ ‚Ä¶ \\\\+ Xnn has the distribution F. The concept of infinite divisibility of probability distributions was introduced in 1929 by Bruno de Finetti. This type of decomposition of a distribution is used in probability and statistics to find families of probability distributions that might be natural choices for certain models or applications. Infinitely divisible distributions play an important role in probability theory in the context of limit theorems. Examples The Poisson distribution, the negative binomial distribution (and therefore also the geometric distribution), the Gamma distribution and the degenerate distribution are examples of infinitely divisible distributions; as are the normal distribution, Cauchy distribution and all other members of the stable distribution family. The uniform distribution and the binomial distribution are not infinitely divisible, nor are any other (non-trivial) distributions with bounded (finite) support. The Student's t-distribution is infinitely divisible, while the distribution of the reciprocal of a random variable having a Student's t-distribution, is not.Johnson, N.L., Kotz, S., Balakrishnan, N. (1995) Continuous Univariate Distributions, Volume 2, 2nd Edition. Wiley, (Chapter 28, page 368) All the compound Poisson distributions are infinitely divisible. Limit theorem Infinitely divisible distributions appear in a broad generalization of the central limit theorem: the limit as n -> +‚àû of the sum Sn = Xn1 \\\\+ ‚Ä¶ \\\\+ Xnn of independent uniformly asymptotically negligible (u.a.n.) random variables within a triangular array : \\\\begin{array}{cccc} X_{11} \\\\\\\\\\\\ X_{21} & X_{22} \\\\\\\\\\\\ X_{31} & X_{32} & X_{33} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots \\\\end{array} approaches -- in the weak sense -- an infinitely divisible distribution. The uniformly asymptotically negligible (u.a.n.) condition is given by : \\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\, \\\\max_{1 \\\\le k \\\\le n} \\\\; P( \\\\left X_{nk} \\\\right > \\\\varepsilon ) = 0 \\\\text{ for every }\\\\varepsilon > 0. Thus, for example, if the uniform asymptotic negligibility (u.a.n.) condition is satisfied via an appropriate scaling of identically distributed random variables with finite variance, the weak convergence is to the normal distribution in the classical version of the central limit theorem. More generally, if the u.a.n. condition is satisfied via a scaling of identically distributed random variables (with not necessarily finite second moment), then the weak convergence is to a stable distribution. On the other hand, for a triangular array of independent (unscaled) Bernoulli random variables where the u.a.n. condition is satisfied through :\\\\lim_{n\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty} np_n = \\\\lambda, the weak convergence of the sum is to the Poisson distribution with mean Œª as shown by the familiar proof of the law of small numbers. L√©vy process Every infinitely divisible probability distribution corresponds in a natural way to a L√©vy process. A L√©vy process is a stochastic process { Lt : t ‚â• 0 } with stationary independent increments, where stationary means that for s < t, the probability distribution of Lt ‚àí Ls depends only on t ‚àí s and where independent increments means that that difference Lt ‚àí Ls is independent of the corresponding difference on any interval not overlapping with [s, t], and similarly for any finite number of mutually non-overlapping intervals. If { Lt : t ‚â• 0 } is a L√©vy process then, for any t ‚â• 0, the random variable Lt will be infinitely divisible: for any n, we can choose (Xn0, Xn1, ‚Ä¶, Xnn) = (Lt/n ‚àí L0, L2t/n ‚àí Lt/n, ‚Ä¶, Lt ‚àí L(n‚àí1)t/n). Similarly, Lt ‚àí Ls is infinitely divisible for any s < t. On the other hand, if F is an infinitely divisible distribution, we can construct a L√©vy process { Lt : t ‚â• 0 } from it. For any interval [s, t] where t ‚àí s > 0 equals a rational number p/q, we can define Lt ‚àí Ls to have the same distribution as Xq1 \\\\+ Xq2 \\\\+ ‚Ä¶ + Xqp. Irrational values of t ‚àí s > 0 are handled via a continuity argument.  Additive process An additive process \\\\\\\\{X_t\\\\\\\\}_{t \\\\geq 0} (a cadlag, continuous in probability stochastic process with independent increments) has infinitely divisible distribution for any t\\\\geq 0. Let \\\\\\\\{\\\\mu_t\\\\\\\\}_{t\\\\geq0} be its family of infinitely divisible distribution. \\\\\\\\{\\\\mu_t\\\\\\\\}_{t\\\\geq0} satisfies a number of conditions of continuity and monotonicity. Morover, if a family of infinitely divisible distribution \\\\\\\\{\\\\mu_t\\\\\\\\}_{t\\\\geq0} satisfies the same continuity and monotonicity conditions it exists (uniquely in law) an Additive process with this distribution \\\\\\\\{\\\\mu_t\\\\\\\\}_{t\\\\geq0}.

Built in 1766, this National Historic Landmark was the home of Silas Deane (1737‚Äì1789), the first foreign diplomat for the United States. Description and history The Deane house is a two-story wood frame structure, four bays wide, with two asymmetrically placed interior chimneys, and a two-story ell extending to the rear. The main entry, in the second bay from the right, is flanked by pilasters and topped by a crowned and dentillated pediment. The interior features original woodwork, including pilasters and fully paneled fireplaces, and an elaborate stairway balustrade.. The house was built in 1766 by Silas Deane. Trained as a lawyer, Deane became involved in resistance to attempts by the British Parliament to levy taxes on its colonies in the late 1760s, and was elected to the Second Continental Congress in 1775. Deane was selected in March 1776 by that Congress to represent it in dealings with the Kingdom of France. Deane successfully negotiated the secret agreement by which France supported the nascent United States prior to its formal entry into the American Revolutionary War in 1778, after signing a formal treaty of alliance negotiated by a commission that included Deane. He later became disenchanted with the rebel cause, and died in exile in Europe. In 1959, Deane's house was donated to The National Society of the Colonial Dames of America in Connecticut and in 1963‚Äì1965, it was restored. It is now open as part of the Webb-Deane-Stevens Museum and includes original furniture and portraits of Deane and his second wife. The Webb-Deane- Stevens Museum also owns the adjacent 18th-century Joseph Webb House and the Isaac Stevens House in Old Wethersfield, and also operates the nearby Buttolph‚ÄìWilliams House, which is owned by Connecticut Landmarks.

It is named after its type site, the Wartberg, a hill (306m asl) near Niedenstein-Kirchberg in northern Hesse, Germany. Distribution The Wartberg near Kirchberg The Wartberg culture is currently known to have a distribution in northern Hesse, southern Lower Saxony and western Thuringia; a southern extent as far as the Rhein-Main Region is possible, but not definitely proven at this point.Raetzel-Fabian 1990, 112, 121 Dates The term Wartberg culture describes a group of sites with similar characteristic finds from circa 3600-2800 BC. The Wartberg culture appears to be a regional development derived from Michelsberg and Baalberge culture antecedents. It is contemporary, and in contact, with Bernburg culture and Funnel Beaker (TRB). The Corded Ware and Single Grave cultures succeed it.Raetzel-Fabian 2002 Sites Fritzlar Plain and the Hasenberg (left) seen from the Wartberg =Settlements= Its best known sites are Wartberg, near Kirchberg,Schrickel 1969 Hasenberg, a hill near Lohne,Schwellnu√ü 1971; 1979: 21-24 as well as G√ºntersbergSchwellnu√ü 1970; 1979, 16-20 and B√ºrgel,Schwellnu√ü 1979: 24-28 hills near Gudensberg (all of the above are located on basalt outcrops in the fertile Fritzlar basin), and from the Calden earthwork enclosure.Raetzel Fabian 2000(b) Nearly all settlements identified so far are in hilltop locations: an enclosed site at Wittelsberg near Am√∂neburg is an exception. Virtually all the known settlements appear to have come into existence several hundred years after the development of Wartberg pottery (see below); early Wartberg settlement activity remains mostly unknown as yet.Raetzel-Fabian 2000, 122-3, 130 Finds from the Wartberg and its sister sites included fragmented bones, mainly of cattle, pig, sheep/goat and deer, but also of other wild animals, like bear or beaver; human bone fragments also occur in some of the settlements.Pinder 1878, 10-11; Schwellnu√ü 1970; 1971; 1979 Originally, the Wartberg (first excavated in the later 19th century) was interpreted as a cult place,Pinder 1878, 11 but the remains of coarse handmade pottery and of mud wall cladding do suggest settlement activity.e.g. Schrickel 1969; Schwellnu√ü 1979 =Megalithic tombs= The tomb at Z√ºschen Wartberg material is also found in a number of gallery graves (a type of megalithic tomb). Their connection with the Wartberg settlements was only recognised in the 1960s and 1970s, thus the tombs are sometimes treated separately as the Hessian-Westphalian stone cist group (Hessisch-Westf√§lische Steinkistengruppe).Schrickel 1976 These include the tombs at Z√ºschen near Fritzlar, at Lohra, at Naumburg-Altendorf, at Hadamar-Niederzeuzheim (now rebuilt in a park at Hachenburg), at Beselich-Niedertiefenbach, at Warburg, Rimbeck and at Grossenrode, as well as two tombs near the Calden enclosure.Jockenh√∂vel 1990, 162-166; Raetzel-Fabian 2000, 112-129 A tomb at Muschenheim near M√ºnzenberg may also belong to the same type,M.

The best known of these tombs are those of Z√ºschen, Lohra, Niederzeuzzheim and Altendorf. They normally contained the inhumed remains of multiple individuals (the Altendorf tomb contained at least 250 people) of all ages and both sexes. Lohra is an exception insofar as there the dead were cremated. Gravegoods are scarce but include pottery (collared bottles), stone tools and animal bones, especially the jawbones of foxes, which may have played a totemic role. The Z√ºschen tomb is also remarkable for the presence of rock art.Raetzel-Fabian 2000, 123-129 Some of the tombs can be directly associated with nearby hilltop sites or settlements,Schwellnu√ü 1979, 57-60 that is, the Z√ºschen tomb with the Hasenberg and the Calden tombs with the earthwork. According to the German archaeologist Waltraud Schrickel, the association with gallery graves suggests a west European influence, perhaps from the Paris Basin in France, where very similar tombs occur.Schrickel 1966 The Wartberg tombs appear to start developing around 3400 BC, earlier than most of the known settlements.Raetzel-Fabian 2000, 122 =Standing stones= A loose distribution of standing stones occurs in northern Hesse and west Thuringia. Although their dates are unknown, their geographic spread appears to coincide with that of Wartberg material, perhaps suggesting a connection.Jockenh√∂vel 1990, 170-173; Raetzel-Fabian 2000, 136-148 =Enclosures= The Calden earthwork, a large enclosure northwest of modern Kassel, was built around 3700 BC. It is an irregular enclosure of two ditches and a palisade, encompassing an area of 14 hectares. The enclosure has five openings, perhaps comparable to British Causewayed enclosures. Although it can with some certainty be seen as derived from the Michelsberg tradition, material associated with its early phases suggests a close connection with early Wartberg. It appears to have been a tradition for several centuries to bury animal bones (food refuse?) and broken pots in pits dug into the partially filled-in earthwork ditches. The ditches also contain the remains of many human inhumations. This activity continued until circa 2000 BC and was particularly intensive during the Wartberg period. Two nearby graves postdate the earthwork by several centuries, but coincide with that activity. While the original function of the earthwork is not necessarily explained by these finds, it appears likely that at least during later phases of its use it had a ritual significance, perhaps connected with a cult of the dead.Raetzel-Fabian 2000(b) In contrast, the enclosure around the settlement at Wittelsberg appears to be simply protective/defensive in nature.Fielder 1991 Finds Collared bottles from the Z√ºschen tomb Typical Wartberg pots in Kassel museum =Pottery= Wartberg pottery is handmade and mostly very coarse. Typical shapes in the mid-4th millennium include saucepans with inturned rim and deep incisions, cups with strap handles, collared bottles (Kragenflaschen). The presence of pottery with deeply incised patterns as well as of clay drums suggest connections with the Funnel Beaker culture (TRB) of Central Germany. In the later Wartberg, strap-handled cups, funnel beakers, varied bowls, large pots with holes below the rim and collared bottles occur. The frequent presence of collared bottles, not least in the tombs, is of special interest. The bottles are made with somewhat more care than other vessels; their very specific shape suggests a special function, often suggested to be connected with the storage of special material, like vegetable oil or sulphur, perhaps for healing purposes.For whole pottery section: Raetzel Fabian 2000, 122, 131 = Stone and bone tools = Slate axes are very common, slate blades also occur. The Wartberg culture produced fine stone arrowheads with well defined tangs and \\"wings\\". A variety of bone tools, mainly points, has been found both in tombs and settlements.Raetzel-Fabian, 2000, 132 Economy Little can be said about the economy of the Wartberg group. The location of sites and certain finds suggest a broadly sedentary society subsisting from agriculture and animal husbandry, but hunting may play a considerable economic role. The Wartberg area appears to be in general trade contact with its neighbouring regions. Social aspects The presence of earthworks and of collective tombs indicates different levels of collective effort, thus implying a considerable degree of social organisation.Raetzel-Fabian 2000, 113 Genetics examined the remains of 4 individuals buried c. 4000-3000 BC at the Bl√§tterh√∂hle site in modern-day Germany, during which the area was part of the Wartberg culture and its predecessor, the Michelsberg culture. The 3 samples of Y-DNA extracted belonged to the paternal haplogroups R1b1, R1 and I2a1, while the 4 samples of mtDNA extracted belonged to the maternal haplogroups U5b2a2, J1c1b1, H5, U5b2b2. The individuals carried a very high amount of Western Hunter-Gatherer (WHG) ancestry, estimated at about 40‚Äì50%, with one individual displaying as much as c. 75% also examined a male of the Wartberg culture buried at Erwitte- Schmerlecke in modern-day Germany c. 3500-2900 BC. He was found to be a carrier of the paternal haplogroup I and the maternal haplogroup J2b1a. examined the remains of 42 people of the Wartberg culture buried at Niedertiefenbach, Germany c. 3300-3200 BC. They were determined to be of about 60% Early European Farmer (EEF) and 40% WHG ancestry. They were found harbor much more hunter-gatherer ancestry and to be genetically substantially different from peoples of the earlier Linear Pottery Culture (LBK), suggesting that the demise of the LBK culture was accompanied by a major demographic shift.

The third ship to be named Asheville by the Navy, PGM-84 was laid down on 15 April 1964 at Tacoma, Washington, by the Tacoma Boatbuilding Company; launched on 1 May 1965; sponsored by Mrs. R. E. Harris; and commissioned on 6 August 1966, Lt. Henry Dale in command. The Asheville employed a Combined diesel or gas turbine (CODOG) propulsion system; twin Cummins Diesels for endurance, and a GE LM1500 gas turbine for high-speed dash.  Assigned to the West Coast  She completed fitting out at Tacoma on 17 September and got underway for her home port, San Diego, California. She arrived there on the 22d and began shakedown training along the California coast Shakedown and operational tests lasted until 18 January 1967 at which time she entered the Long Beach Naval Shipyard for post-shakedown availability. Those repairs continued until 14 March at which time she returned to San Diego. She remained in port there for two weeks. On 28 March, she departed San Diego en route to the western Pacific. On 1 April, the gunboat was redesignated PG-84. After stops at Pearl Harbor and Guam and a return visit to the latter island necessitated by a breakdown in her main propulsion plant, Asheville finally arrived at Cam Ranh Bay in South Vietnam on 7 May.  Vietnam operations  Upon her arrival, she began an extended deployment to the western Pacific Ocean lasting just over eight years, a tour of duty marred by chronic material casualties and frequent repair periods. During the first six years of the deployment, the gunboat served with the Coastal Surveillance Force in South Vietnam when not undergoing repairs at such places as Subic Bay, Guam, Cam Ranh Bay, or Vung Tau. During her line periods, she conducted blockade missions‚Äîcodenamed Operation Market Time along the South Vietnamese coast in an attempt to interdict the waterborne flow of arms and supplies from North Vietnam to the communist forces operating in South Vietnam. As a secondary mission, the ship provided gunfire support for American and South Vietnamese forces operating ashore. = Conducting coastal surveillance missions = Late in 1970, Asheville broke her routine of Market Time operations punctuated by frequent repair periods when, after completing an overhaul and restricted availability at Guam, she operated for two months‚Äîfrom late November 1970 to late January 1971‚Äîin the Mariana Islands. On 20 January 1971, the ship departed Guam to resume duty in Vietnamese waters. Once again, she conducted coastal surveillance and gunfire support missions‚Äîthough still plagued by chronic material casualties which frequently took her off the line for repairs. On 18 May, the ship returned to Guam for almost two months of repairs. When she completed that work on 9 July, Asheville embarked upon seven weeks of patrols and port visits in the Trust Territories of the Pacific. She concluded that assignment at Guam on 1 September and then conducted refresher training out of Apra Harbor for the next two months. = Vietnam and Thailand operations = Asheville departed Guam on 5 November and, after a 16-day stop at Subic Bay, returned to Vung Tau. Her duty in South Vietnam lasted until late March 1972 when she headed via Subic Bay back to Guam. The warship arrived at Apra Harbor on 31 May and remained in the Marianas until 13 November. After a stop at Subic Bay on 21 November, she briefly returned to Vietnamese waters before heading for Bangkok, Thailand, where she remained well into the second week in December. On 12 December, she departed Bangkok and, after the usual call at Subic Bay, reentered Apra Harbor on the 27th. = End of Vietnam War operations = While she was there, the end of American involvement in the Vietnam War halted her combat activities. For the next 17 months, Asheville continued to operate in the central and western Pacific. In November and December 1973, she interrupted her schedule of operations for a cruise to the southern Pacific during which she visited Surabaya, Indonesia, and the Australian ports Cairns, Darwin, and Gove as well as Rabaul on New Britain and Manus in the Admiralty Islands. She returned to Guam on 17 December 1973 and resumed operations from that port.  Return to Stateside as a training ship  On 21 June 1974, the gunboat stood out of Apra Harbor bound ultimately for the United States. She stopped at Oahu from 4 to 6 July and arrived at San Diego, California, on the 16th. On 1 August, she began the long voyage to duty with the U.S. Naval Reserve in Chicago, Illinois. She took almost three months to reach her destination and stopped at a long list of ports along the way. Finally, however, Asheville arrived in Chicago on 28 October 1974. The gunboat spent the remainder of her active career operating on the Great Lakes out of Chicago as a training platform for Naval Reserve personnel of the Chicago area.  Decommissioning  She continued that duty until placed out of commission on 31 January 1977, and her name was simultaneously stricken from the Navy list. On 11 April 1977, the ship was transferred to the Massachusetts Maritime Academy.  Military awards and honors  Asheville (PG-84) earned 14 battle stars for service in the Vietnam War.

It is one of only two surviving members of the American mosquito fleet, and it was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1992. and History Sabino was built in the W. Irving Adams shipyard in East Boothbay, Maine, and the 57-foot vessel was christened as Tourist on May 7, 1908. She began her career as a ferry for the Damariscotta Steamboat Company on the Damariscotta River in Maine; she sank in 1918 due to an accident but was salvaged. On October 8, 1921, she was sold to the Popham Beach Steamboat Company on the Kennebec River, and the new owners changed the vessel's name to Sabino in honor of Abenaki sagamore Sabenoa. On July 23, 1927, Sabino was purchased by the Cape Shore Ferry Company in Portland, Maine. She ferried passengers from Portland to the many islands of Casco Bay, and sponsons were added in 1928 to help stabilize her in the open water of the Bay. She was again sold in 1935, this time to the Casco Bay Lines. After a few years, she began to show her age and was put into the company's reserve fleet. She was returned to regular ferry service in 1956 when another ferry ran aground. However, her usefulness to the Casco Bay Lines was short-lived and she was sold to Red Slavit in 1958, who sold her to Philip and Irene Corbin of Salisbury, Massachusetts soon after. The Corbin family spent a great amount of time repairing the vessel and bringing her up to Coast Guard regulations for a passenger vessel. In 1971, the Sabino was sold to C. Bruce Brown, Joseph Pulvino, and Philip Corbin's son Jim, doing business as Steamship Sabino Inc. Jim was made part of the corporation because neither Pulvino nor Brown had any practical experience running a steamboat. Brown was an insurance salesman and Pulvino was an aeronautical engineer with the General Electric Company in Lynn, Massachusetts. The Sabino had run on the river a year before but had no licensed captain or engineer. In order for her to do real business, they needed a licensed captain and a licensed engineer. Capt. Dana Terell from Cape Elizabeth, Maine was hired as the captain, and Pulvino approached the Commander of the US Coast Guard in Boston and asked for an engineering license. He was told that experience was needed as a seaman in the engine room. Pulvino explained the situation and it was agreed that, if he could pass the examination to be a marine engineer, the Commander would issue a license limited to the Sabino. Pulvino passed the exam along with his mentor John Clements, and he was issued a limited license. The Sabino began operating from Newburyport on the Merrimack River on Memorial Day, running between Newburyport and the Black Rocks in Salisbury Beach in one direction, and Newburyport and Merrimac, Massachusetts in the other direction. On extreme high tides, she would make it all the way to Haverhill. She operated both day and nighttime jazz cruises on the Merrimack River until 1974, when she was leased for one year to the Mystic Seaport Museum to determine if a steamboat would appeal to the museum's patrons. The ocean voyage between Newburyport and Mystic Seaport was almost the demise of the Sabino. She hit large waves on the trip which stirred up all the dormant coal from the bilge and blocked the onboard bilge pumps, causing the engine room to fill with water. Luckily, there was a large gasoline-powered pump on board that was used to keep her afloat. She limped into Groton, Connecticut to be immediately pulled from the water. The Mystic Seaport shipyard experts recalked her bottom, and she became a popular attraction, prompting the museum to purchase her. Under the museum's care, Sabino received a complete makeover, and was brought back to her former glory. In 1992, she was designated a National Historic Landmark. Operation Sabino is operated by a captain, one or two engineers, and two deck hands. The captain does not directly control the direction or speed of the vessel. Instead, the captain relays his commands through a sequence of bells and gongs to the engineer, who controls the engine. Sabino has an average speed of and will consume 60 tons of coal annually. It is estimated that Sabino carries approximately 33,000 passengers per year. Current status Sabino currently operates regularly at the Mystic Seaport giving patrons tours of the Mystic River.

The Royal Frankish Annals makes mention of a Wonomyrus Sclavus (Vojnomir the Slav) active in 795. Eric of Friuli, sent Vojnomir with his army into Pannonia, between the Danube and Tisza, where they pillaged the Avars' dominions. According to Milko Kos they were not met with serious Avar resistance, and they conquered many forts.Kos Milko (1902): Gradivo za zgodovino Slovencev v srednjem veku. Ljubljana, Leonova dru≈æba. Case 293, pg. 325-327. The next year the Avars were defeated and Frankish power was extended further east, to the central Danube. Vojnomir's leading position in the campaign has been presumed as very possible with regard to the textual analysis of Annales regni Francorum.≈†i≈°iƒá Ferdo (1902). Povijest Hrvata u vrijeme narodnih vladara. Zagreb, Nakladni zavod matice Hrvatske. pp. 304-305 His origin and social position are not mentioned in any contemporary medieval source. His identity has been the subject of several hypotheses. Hypotheses Map showing the growth of the Frankish power Vojnomir remains an enigmatic historical personality. Even the correct reading of his name is unclear. Instead of Vojnomir the original Wonomyro (Uuonomiro, Uuonomyro) could also be read as Zvonimir, just like the name of Croat king Demetrius Zvonimir has been corrupted in Svinimiro.Nenad, Labus (2000): Tko je ubio vojvodu Erika. From: ≈†anjek Franjo (ur): Radovi Zavoda za povijesne znanosti HAZU u Zadru. Sv. 42. Page. 10. Some authors interpret Vojnomir as having been a Croatian duke, a military leader of the Frankish army, or the prince of Carniola.for example W. Pohl, H. Krahwinkler, R. Brato≈æ, F. Kos, M. Kos, B. Grafenauer. In: ≈†tih, Peter (2001). Ozemlje Slovenije v zgodnjem srednjem veku: Osnovne poteze zgodovinskega razvoja od zaƒçetka 6. do konca 9. stoletja. Ljubljana, Filozofska fakulteta. Page 41-42; and in: Grafenauer Bogo: Vojnomir There are three most reliable hypotheses about his origin: the \\"Pannonian hypothesis\\", the \\"Career hypothesis\\" and the \\"Carniolan hypothesis\\".Voje, Ignacij(1994). Nemirni Balkan: Zgodovinski pregled od 6. Do 18. Stoletja. Ljubljana, DZS. Page 47. At least two explanations could be read in the context of modern nationalistic mythology: Slovene and German authors from the Austrian part of Austria-Hungary are prone to support the Carniolan origin and Croatian authors are prone to support the Pannonian or the Istrian origin. =Pannonian hypothesis= According to the Pannonian hypothesis, Vojnomir was a knez (duke or prince) of Lower Pannonia (known in Croatian historiography as \\"Pannonian Croatia\\"), from ca. 790 to 800 or from 791 to ca. 810. He is believed to have fought the Pannonian Avars during their occupation of what is today northern Croatia; according to Francis Dvornik, he launched a joint counterattack with the help of Frankish troops under King Charlemagne in 791, successfully driving the Avars out of Croatia. In return for the help of Charlemagne, Vojnomir was obliged to recognize the Frankish sovereignty and convert to Christianity. On Christmas Day in 800, a year after the Siege of Trsat, the Pope Leo III crowned Charlemagne as Imperator Romanorum (\\"Emperor of the Romans\\") in Saint Peter's Basilica. Nicephorus I of the Byzantine Empire and Charlemagne of the Holy Roman Empire settle their imperial boundaries in 803. Following these events, known as the Pax Nicephori, the Duchy of Croatia peacefully accepted limited Frankish overlordship. Contrary to Croatia, after the death of duke Vojnomir, the former Frankish ally Lower Pannonia led a resistance to Frankish domination under the leadership of duke Ljudevit Posavski. Fine Jr. claimed that Vojnomir was a Croatian duke who aided Charlemagne's major victory against the Pannonian Avars in 796, after which the Franks were made overlords \\"over the Croatians of northern Dalmatia, Slavonia and Pannonia\\". =Career hypothesis= The military hypothesis claims that Vojnomir was only a Slav making a career in the Frankish troops. He was not a ruler. From the only reliable contemporary source, Annales regni Francorum, it is known that Vojnomir was a military leader.Grafenauer Bogo: Vojnomir His status as a duke or a prince is not mentioned at all. In the past most of the historians described Vojnomir as one of Slavic dukes or princes in the neighbourhood of Friuli. However, according to Peter ≈†tih, it is hard to believe that a leader of a foreign land could be accepted as a Frankish military leader by the Franks; he was probably only an exceptional Slavic individual who made his career in the Frankish army and perhaps he was only a Friulian Slav. According to Nenad Labus, Vojnomir could also have been a military leader from Istria. =Carniolan hypothesis= Many authors interpret Vojnomir as the Prince of Carniola. One of the arguments is that Carniola was the land just between Friuli and Avaria. Frankish troops passed Carniola, so this land is natural candidate for Vojnomir's homeland.Kos Milko (1933). Zgodovina Slovencev od naselitve do reformacije. Ljubljana, Jugoslovanska knjigarna. Str. 64. Carniolans also hated their Avarian enemies. There are claims that the ancestors of the Croats were not the subjects of the Franks at this time. The Carniolans on the other side were already ruled by the Franks from 791 AD with their basic autonomy and the rule of their own domestic princes retained until the rebel of Ljudevit. Regarding the subordination of the Croat ancestors it was proved only for the Slavs in Dalmatia, whereas the Pannonian Slavs could have been subjected to the Franks already in the year 791.

The CDI has authority over how the insurance industry conducts business within California, and licenses and regulates the rates and practices of insurance companies, agents, and brokers in the state. CDI has over 1,300 employees charged with the responsibility of protecting consumer interests. Its budget is primarily derived from funds generated by license fees, assessments, and Proposition 103 recoupment fees. The CDI licenses over 1,500 insurance companies and more than 320,000 insurance agents and insurance brokers in the state of California, United States. The current California Insurance Commissioner is Ricardo Lara. History In the early 1900s, the California State Legislature transformed the CDI into a law enforcement agency when it passed new anti-fraud insurance legislation. The legislation provided sworn peace officers to investigate and arrest those who commit fraud. =Proposition 103 (1988)= On November 8, 1988, California voters passed Proposition 103, by a narrow margin (51%), on the promise of providing consumers with a 20% rate rollback. It also broadened the Department of Insurance's responsibility for enforcement to include property insurance, automobile insurance, life insurance and other types of casualty coverage, including a requirement that the property and casualty insurance premium rates must be pre-approved by the department. Proposition 103 also changed the status of the California Insurance Commissioner to that of an elected official, from being a governor-appointed position. Proposition 103 also expanded the department's important role in consumer affairs. In 2001, the CDI implemented and began overseeing the Slavery Era Insurance Registry, as per new legislation requirements signed into law in 2000. The registry was created to require insurance companies to disclose any historical data regarding slavery insurance policies they might have from the early days of California for the purposes of historical research, genealogy, and to preserve any evidence which might be material to reparations claims. Consumer protection The CDI helps consumers by regulating how insurance companies market and administer their policies, and is charged with the responsibility of ensuring that insurance business transacted in the state is conducted in an honest, open, and fair manner. The CDI has a Rate Regulation Branch, established under the provisions of Proposition 103, that is responsible for reviewing proposed personal auto and homeowners insurance rates to ensure that they are fair, reasonable, and adequate. Licensing The California Insurance Code (CIC) requires that the CDI provides licensing examinations for brokers and agents, and that the department must investigate suspected violations of the CIC by businesses and individuals who possess CDI licenses. The CDI also oversees the licensing of bail bond agents. Criminal investigation The CDI is charged with responsibility for investigating and arresting those who commit insurance fraud, in order to protect the public from loss and distress. Claimant, agent, and insurance company fraud is investigated and prosecuted by the agency. The agency maintains criminal investigators in many parts of the state. Investigators from the CDI work closely with the internal investigators at insurance companies in cases of suspected claimant and agent fraud. After concluding an investigation, the CDI will either close the case or refer the matter to the prosecuting agency in the jurisdiction where the alleged misconduct occurred. Consumer education The CDI publishes brochures and maintains a website to help consumers become aware of their rights, and to aid them in making informed insurance decisions. As part of the department's mission to protect consumers, an Education and Outreach Program has been established to provide speakers who participate in public events such as town hall meetings, business and community fairs, and professional association events.

It was adopted by the Prussians (as the 1811 pattern or \\"Bl√ºcher sabre\\") and used by Portuguese and Spanish cavalry. Background During the early part of the French Revolutionary Wars, the British Army launched an expeditionary force into Flanders. With the invading army was a young captain of the 2nd Dragoon Guards, serving as a brigade major, John Gaspard Le Marchant. Le Marchant noted the lack of professional skill displayed by the horsemen and the clumsy design of the heavy, over-long swords then in use (the 1788 Patterns) and decided to do something about it. Among many other things Le Marchant did to improve the cavalry, he designed, in collaboration with the Birmingham sword cutler Henry Osborn, a new sabre. This was adopted by the British Army as the Pattern 1796 Light Cavalry Sabre. Le Marchant wanted his sabre to be adopted by all British cavalry, but the board of general officers decided to arm the heavy cavalry with a straight sword.Thoumine, pp. 43-45.  Design  An officer's 1796 Pattern Light Cavalry fighting sabre - belonging to William Tomkinson of the 16th Light Dragoons; the sword shows evidence of having been ground down in the quarter of the blade nearest the point - possibly due to damage to the edge - it no longer exhibits the increase in blade width near to the point An officer's 1796 Pattern Light Cavalry fighting sabre by J. Johnston, Newcastle Street, The Strand, London. Note the characteristic increase in blade width near to the point. The scabbard has lost its suspension rings. An eastern influence can be detected in the blade form, and Le Marchant is recorded as saying that the \\"blades of the Turks, Mamalukes, Moors and Hungarians [were] preferable to any other\\".Thoumine, p. 44 The blade profile is similar to some examples of the Indian tulwar, and expert opinion has commented upon this.Robson, p.23. The British sword is similar to some tulwars in the widening of the blade near the tip, which is gradual and does not incorporate a step as is found in the yelman of the Turkish kilij. This similarity prompted some Indian armourers to re-hilt old 1796 pattern blades as tulwars later in the 19th century.Cavalry Journal, Vol. XIV (1924), p. 108Nolan, Louis. Cavalry: its History and Tactics (Bosworth 1853, Pallas Armata facsimile reprint 1995). The author, a British cavalry officer, was killed in the Charge of the Light Brigade (Crimean War). In his work he describes the high incidence of horrendous wounds (decapitations and severed limbs) caused by refurbished British P 1796 light cavalry swords when wielded by troopers of the army of the Nizam of Hyderabad (serving as British allies). =Trooper pattern sabre= The 1796 sabre had a pronounced curve, making the kind of slashing attacks used in cavalry actions decidedly easier. Even cavalrymen trained to use the thrust, as the French were, in the confusion of a melee often reverted to instinctive hacking, which the 1796 accommodated. Its blade, unlike other European sabres of the period, widened near the point. This affected balance, but made slashes far more brutal; its action in the cut has been compared to a modern bacon slicer. It is said that this vicious design prompted unofficial complaints from French officers, but this is unconfirmed. The blade of the light cavalry sabre was from in length and had a single broad fuller on each side. The sabre was lighter and easier to use than its heavy cavalry counterpart, the pattern 1796 Heavy Cavalry Sword, which had a less 'scientific' design. The hilt was of the simple 'stirrup' form with a single iron knucklebow and quillon, so as to be free of unnecessary weight; the intention of this was to make the sabre usable by all cavalrymen, not solely the largest and strongest. A typical trooper's sabre would be close to 2lb 2oz (0.96kg) in weight. In common with the contemporary heavy cavalry sword, the iron backpiece of the grip had ears which were riveted through the tang of the blade to give the hilt and blade a very secure connection. The grip was of ridged wood covered in leather. It was carried in an iron scabbard, with wooden liners, and hung from the waist via sword-belt slings attached to two loose suspension rings.Robson pp. 23-26Le Marchant, pp. 49-52 =Officers' sabres= Hilt of an officer's fighting 1796 LC pattern sabre. The unusual square langets (most are rounded or shield- shaped) is a characteristic of the sabres made by the London sword cutler J. Johnston Officers carried fighting swords very similar in form to those of the trooper version, though they tended to be lighter, at around 1lb 13oz (0.83kg), in weight and show evidence of higher levels of finish and workmanship.Martyn, pp.63-65 They were also distinguished in the hilt by the grips being wire-wound (silver or gilt copper/brass) and in the backpiece having reduced-size ears, often comma-shaped, or no ears at all. Officers stationed in India sometimes had the hilts and scabbards of their swords silvered as a protection against the high humidity of the Monsoon season. Unlike the officers of the heavy cavalry, light cavalry officers did not have a pattern dress sword. As a result of this there were many swords made which copied elements of the 1796 pattern design but incorporated a high degree of decoration, such as blue and gilt or frost-etched blades, and gilt-bronze hilts.Robson pp. 66-67 At their most showy, sabres with ivory grips and lion's-head pommels are not unknown. These swords were obviously primarily intended for dress rather than battle. Soon after 1800 'Mameluke-hilted' sabres, either original Turkish kilij swords or copies derived from them, became popular for officers to wear when on foot in full dress.Robson, p. 67 Use 250px The mounted swordsmanship training of the British emphasised the cut, at the face for maiming or killing, or at the arms to disable. This left masses of mutilated or disabled troops; the French, in contrast, favoured the thrust, which gave cleaner kills.\\"An Officer of Dragoons\\". United Service Journal (vol. II, 1831). A cut with the 1796 LC sabre was, however, perfectly capable of killing outright, as was recorded by George Farmer of the 11th Regiment of Light Dragoons, who was involved in a skirmish on the Guadiana River in 1811, during the Peninsular War:  Fame  The blade is remembered today as one of the best of its time and has been described as the finest cutting sword ever manufactured in quantity. Officers of the famous 95th Rifles, other light infantry regiments and the \\"flank\\" companies of line regiments adopted swords with an identical hilt to the 1796 light cavalry sabre, but with a lighter and shorter blade.Fletcher, p. 103 The sabre was also copied by the Prussians; indeed, some Imperial German troops were equipped with almost identical swords into the First World War. The Americans also adopted a pattern which was directly influenced by the British sword.

Built in the early 18th century, it was the birthplace and boyhood home of Samuel Huntington (1731‚Äì96), an American statesman. He served as a delegate to the Continental Congress, where he signed the Declaration of Independence, served as Governor of Connecticut, and was also the first presiding officer of the Congress of the Confederation, the first central government of the United States of America. Description and history The Huntington house is a 2¬Ω story wood- frame structure, five bays wide, with a side gable roof and large central chimney. The roof at the rear of the house slopes down to the first floor, giving the house a classic New England saltbox appearance. A small kitchen wing was added to the east side of the house in the 19th century. The interior has a typical Georgian central-chimney plan, with a vestibule and narrow winding stair in front of the chimney, public rooms to either side, and a large kitchen and small bedroom behind. Upstairs there are three bedrooms. The interior features, including woodwork and plaster, are almost entirely original. The house was built sometime in the first quarter of the 18th century.. The house was declared a National Historic Landmark and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. In 1994 The Governor Samuel Huntington Trust was formed by local citizens to preserve the property. Since 1998 the trust has worked to restore and rehabilitate the property, and has sponsored archaeological work to understand its use. The trust operates it as a historic house museum, open for tours from May through October on the first and third Saturday of the month. Significance Samuel Huntington was born in this house in 1731, when the area was still part of Windham. He was self- educated in the law, and was admitted to the bar in 1758. Prior to the American Revolution, Huntington practiced law and served in a variety of legal positions in the Connecticut Colony, including King's attorney, judge, and justice of the peace. He sat in the Connecticut State Legislature from 1775 to 1784, and also sat in the Continental Congress during those same years, serving as the body's president between 1779 and 1781. As a member of the Congress in 1776 he signed the United States Declaration of Independence. He was Governor of Connecticut from 1786 to 1796, the year of his death.

He was one of the driving forces behind a major shift within the field of vocal pedagogy during the middle of the 20th century. Along with a few other American singing teachers, such as Ralph Appelman at Indiana University, Vennard introduced contemporary scientific research in the areas of human anatomy and physiology into the study of singing. This shift in approach led to the rejection of many of the beliefs and practices held since the bel canto era, most particularly in the areas of vocal registration and vocal resonation. Vennard was renowned as an excellent teacher whose written works have influenced generations of singers, vocal pedagogues and voice scientists. He taught many successful singers including acclaimed mezzo-soprano Marilyn Horne, who studied under him at the University of Southern California. Vennard studied English at Taylor University in Upland, Indiana graduating with a bachelor's degree in 1930. He became interested in music and decided to pursue a career as an opera singer. He studied at Northwestern University earning a Bachelor of Music in Vocal Performance in 1941, followed by graduate studies at the American Conservatory of Music in Chicago, where he earned a master's degree in Vocal Performance in 1943. Vennard spent the next several years teaching part-time simultaneously at the Chicago Evangelistic Institute, DePaul University and the American Conservatory. In 1946 he became a member of the faculty of music at the University of Southern California, chairing its voice department from 1950 ‚Äì 1971. Among the associations to which he belonged are the National Association of Teachers of Singing, which he served in several capacities, including national president. In 1970 he was awarded an honorary doctorate from Pepperdine University in recognition of his outstanding contributions to singing and the science of singing. As a singer, Vennard was active in opera, oratorio and solo song; as a teacher of singing, many of his students achieved worldwide success. His renowned text, Singing, the Mechanism and the Technique, is a constant resource for teachers and researchers alike. Vennard‚Äôs collaboration with Janwillem van den Berg resulted in his film Voice Production: the Vibrating Larynx. Winning several awards, including best medical research film from a festival in Prague in 1960, it shows the anatomy and physiology of voice production in the excised larynx. He was a pioneer in the science of singing and in voice pedagogy and was instrumental in fostering collaborative efforts between singers, physicists, psychologists and voice scientists.

She is the founder of the Photographer Unknown Archive (1984) and creator of the Michal Heiman Tests No. 1-4 (M.H.T). Her work bears on issues of history, human and women‚Äôs rights, trauma, and memory, as well as an examination of the photographic medium, using reenactment, installation, archival materials, photographs, film, and lecture-performances. Heiman teaches at the Bezalel Academy of Art and Design in Jerusalem and is a member of the Tel Aviv Institute for Contemporary Psychoanalysis.  Artistic career  Michal Heiman, Nouraldin Musa (b. Bendisea, W, Darfur, Sudan, 1976), asylum seeker, photographer and actor in Legislative Theatre Group Holot, lives in Canada. Asylum (The Dress) 1855-2017, 2015, digitally printed photograph, 80X60 cmFor over three decades, since graduating from Art Studies at Hamidrash School of Art in 1984, Heiman has been developing a discipline that inhabits a field between photography, psychoanalysis, human rights, theory, and praxis. Heiman‚Äôs work has been exhibited in leading venues around the world. In 1997, Heiman represented Israel at Documenta X in Kassel, Germany, debuting her first Michal Heiman Test box and procedure. In 2008, her solo exhibition Attacks on Linking debuted at the Helena Rubinstein Pavilion for Contemporary Art, Tel Aviv Museum of Art. In 2017, Heiman exhibited her solo exhibition, AP ‚Äì Artist Proof, Asylum (The Dress, 1855-2017), at the Herzliya Museum of Contemporary Art - a large-scale installation and performance work that incorporated the participation and input of visitors, and which raised questions concerning the notion of the right to return. Among her notable works are a lecture/film on British psychoanalyst Wilfred Bion and video works based on case studies by psychoanalysts Sigmund Freud and D.W. Winnicott. Heiman has also exhibited in venues such as the University of Melbourne Museum of Art; Le Quartier Centre d'Art Contemporain, Quimper, France; the Jewish Museum, New York City; the Museum of Modern Art, Saitama, Japan; the Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven, the Netherlands, and the Changjiang Museum of Contemporary Art, China, and others. Heiman brings her critical voice to bear on issues of history, while engaging with human rights and more specifically, women‚Äôs rights, exploring and questioning the ability of visual tools to penetrate traumatic experiences through different tactics and pre-enactments, as well as examine the photographic medium, its therapeutic potential, and its role in the struggle for social justice. Her enactment and installation works, archival materials, photography and film series, and her lectures/performances are deeply rooted in the political, familial, and social arenas. From 2019-2020, Heiman will exhibit her work in the United States, focusing on her growing archive of narratives and histories of marginalized, pioneering, and revolutionary women, first with Radical Link: A New Community of Women, 1855-2020 in Washington, DC and then with Hearing in Los Angeles, California.  Activism  Heiman has been active as a women‚Äôs right advocate for many years. In 2015, she founded the organization Women in Academia to protect and advance women's equality in Bezalel Academy of Art and Design, and in 2018, she founded the public-benefit corporation An Academy of Her Own, which advocates for gender equality in various academic institutions.  Personal life  Heiman has two children, Leigh (26) and Emily (22).

The Rome Statute established the International Criminal Court in 2002 as a permanent tribunal to prosecute individuals accused of the most serious crimes of international concern, and provided that a review conference be held seven years after the entry into force.See Article 123 of the Rome Statute Scope The Review Conference considered amendments to the Rome Statute and the Statute made specific reference to reviewing the list of crimes within the court's jurisdiction. The final resolution when the Rome Statute was signed specifically recommended that the review should reconsider including drug trafficking and terrorism in the list of crimes, and also agreeing on a definition of crimes of aggression so that the court can exercise its jurisdiction over this crime.Amnesty International, 2 November 2006. International Criminal Court: Concerns at the fifth session of the Assembly of States Parties. Accessed 2006-12-05. Two amendments to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court were adopted. The first one is to extend the jurisdiction of the Court over some war crimes committed in non- international conflicts for which it already had jurisdiction if committed in international conflicts. The second one defines the crime of aggression and lays out conditions for the jurisdiction of the Court to be in force. The transitional provision of Article 124 regarding the war crimes opt-out was also discussed at the review conference, but it was decided to retain it for the time being. There was some disagreement as to whether the amendment relating to the definition of the crime of aggression needs ratification by seven eighths of the states parties (as a change of institutional provisions would) to enter into force or if it comes only in force for those countries that have ratified it (as a change of crime provisions would and as the amendment itself puts it).Discussion paper proposed by the Chairman, International Criminal Court - Assembly of State Parties, 2007-01-16, accessed on 2007-10-14 See footnote 1 on page 3 With the latter view prevailing, the United Nations Security Council could also refer to the Court a situation regarding a crime of aggression allegedly committed by a national of a non- state party.

Biography General Herrera was the Secretary of War & Navy during the presidency of Gerardo Machado. He was married to Ofelia Rodr√≠guez Arango and they had three children, Alberto, Rodolfo and Ofelia Herrera y Rodr√≠guez-Arango. Role in Machado's administration and the 1933 Revolution On August 11, 1933, when Cuban Army rebels took hold of the Castillo de la Real Fuerza, General Herrera attended the fortress in order to reach a resolution or pact with the rebels. He met with Erasmo Delgado. After much debate and given that the rebels did not want Herrera to secure the presidency after Machado‚Äôs departure, it was agreed that giving his powers as General the actions committed by the rebels did not constitute a revolt but were ordered on his behalf. After Machado‚Äôs departure After the departure of Machado on August 12, 1933, a power vacuum was created and Sumner Welles initially proposed the replacement of Machado with Herrera. Unfortunately, the army rebels were not in accord with this proposal. Sumner Welles noted on August 12, 1933 \\"After the promise of certain of the Army leaders at 4 o'clock this morning that they would agree to the ad interim Presidency of any Cuban provided President Machado would retire from the office I was advised at 7 that they had again changed their minds and would accept anyone other than General Herrera to whom they were personally devoted but whom they feared the great mass of the opposition would not accept on account of his past intimate connection with President Machado.\\"Foreign Relations of the United States: Diplomatic Papers, 1933. The American Republics: Volume V,p. 358 http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1933v05/reference/frus.frus1933v05.i0010.pdf As a result, Sumner Welles devised a new plan in which Herrera would remain the only Cabinet member who would not resign from Machado's administration thus by default becoming the interim President solely for the purpose of appointing Carlos Manuel de C√©spedes y Quesada, the son of Carlos Manuel de C√©spedes (Father of the Country), as member of Herrera's Cabinet. Immediately thereafter, Herrera would resign and as Carlos Manuel de C√©spedes y Quesada would be the only one left in the Cabinet, he would by default become the new President. Sumner Welles' intention was to keep a form of constitutional continuance between the departure of Machado and the installation of a new government. Some scholars, such as Rolando Rodriguez, have questioned whether the appointment of Carlos Manuel de C√©spedes y Quesada as a Cabinet member followed by his appointment as President thereafter was constitutional at all.

He subsequently worked for various stations in Perth and Western Australia, in both presenting and producing roles.

Here he adopted an often aggressive style with callers ‚Äì making it clear he did not suffer fools gladly. Though this sometimes caused irritation it was a valuable asset to the station. (He was once satirised in Private Eye as ‚ÄòBrian Bastard'). Since 1990 Hayes has appeared on various stations, including presenting the BBC Radio 2 breakfast show throughout 1992, which was subtitled Good Morning UK throughout his tenure. He left the show at the end of the year due to unpopularity, and he was replaced by the show's former host Terry Wogan in January 1993. Hayes presented the weekly phone-in Hayes over Britain on BBC Radio 2 in the 1990s, winning a Gold Sony Radio Award for 'Best Phone-In', a programme on Euthanasia, as well as sitting in for Jimmy Young and his successor Jeremy Vine until 2006.

Either Bower is confused or Matthew changed his name or took a pseudonym more appropriate to the environment of the \\"international\\" church, a practise not unusual in the period.Bartlett, England, pp. 538-41. He was given the title of Magister (\\"Master\\") by Bower, indicating the completion of a university education and more particularly of a Masters' degree at some stage in his life, but details of this have not survived and the title may be spurious.Dowden, Bishops, p. 213; Watt, Dictionary, p. 385. He is found as succentor of the cathedral of Ross in a Moray document dating between 1255 and 1271; he is the first person known to have held this position, and probably the first to have held this new position under the new cathedral constitution of 1256.Innes (ed.), Registrum Episcopatus Moraviensis, no. 282; Watt, Dictionary, p. 385; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 284. After the death of Robert, Bishop of Ross, Matthew was part of the team of five compromissarii (delegated electors) who voted for the new bishop; as it happened, it was Matthew who was elected.Dowden, Bishops, pp. 212-3; Watt, Dictionary, p. 385. He travelled to the papal court at Orvieto, along with the archdeacon Robert de Fyvie, and without waiting very long, was consecrated by Pope Gregory X personally (per nos ipsos) by 28 December 1272, on which date a mandate was issued authorising him to proceed to his bishopric.Dowden, Bishops, pp. 212-3; Watt, Dictionary, p. 385; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 267. Presumably after returning to Ross, he travelled back to continental Europe to attend the Second Council of Lyon in France, held in the summer of 1274. There, according to Bower, he died (of unspecified causes); Bower on this occasion calls him Magister Matthaeus episcopus Rossensis, \\"Master Matthew Bishop of Ross\\" rather than Macchabeus.Dowden, Bishops, p. 213; Watt, Dictionary, pp. 385-6. Whether or not Bower's claim about his death at Lyons is true, the bishopric was certainly vacant by the following Christmas.Watt, Dictionary, p. 386; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 267.

At that time, the CBC only had rights to the Montreal Canadiens and Toronto Maple Leafs' games; home games only during the season and all games in the playoffs. However, with both the Canadiens and Maple Leafs eliminated in the semi- finals, the CBC's worst nightmare became reality. The CBC had to conceive a way to carry the Finals between the Chicago Black Hawks and Detroit Red Wings or face public revolt. According to lore, the CBC found a way to link their Windsor viewers as having a vested interest in the Finals with the across the river Red Wings. Thus, CBC was able to carry the series after inking special contracts with the Red Wings and Black Hawks as a service to the Windsor market. From Windsor, CBC linked the signal to Toronto and they relayed the coverage Dominion-wide. From there, Canadians were able to see the Finals with nary a glitch in the coverage.

Built ca 1720, it is one of the oldest houses in Farmington. A well-preserved saltbox with post-medieval construction features, it was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960. Architecture The Stanley-Whitman House is the fourth-oldest existent structure and the oldest seventeenth-century structure in modern-day Farmington. A centrally located chimney made of field and sandstone divides the house into two symmetrical halves. The original ca. 1720 house had four rooms and a third-story attic space. Family members lived, worked, and entertained in the parlor and kitchen on the ground floor and the parlor chamber and kitchen chamber on the second floor. When second owner Solomon Whitman added a lean-to onto the existing room-over-room 3-storey building in the mid-eighteenth century, he expanded his family's living space and extended the roof line to create the classic saltbox silhouette for which Stanley-Whitman House is famous. The house has a framed overhang, in which the second story extends over the first story. Four drop pendants, carved into the lower end of the posts, ornament the overhang; two of these are original while the other two are reproductions. History Captain John Stanley (1624‚Äì1706) acquired the property where the Stanley- Whitman House would later stand sometime in the early eighteenth century. Stanley later bequeathed the property to his son Deacon John Stanley (1647‚Äì1729), then acting leader of Farmington's First Congregational Church. The younger John Stanley commissioned the construction of a \\"Dwelling house\\" on his new property between 1709 and 1719. It is likely that the younger John Stanley never inhabited the house, having soon thereafter sold the partially finished structure and six acres of land to Ebenezer Steele (1671‚Äì1722) in December 1720. When Steele died several years later, daughter Mary Steele (1706‚Äì1789) inherited the house. In 1725, 18-year-old Mary and her 25-year-old husband Thomas Smith (1699‚Äì1788?) moved in, becoming its first occupants.Internal research binder, Stanley-Whitman House Furnishing Plan Committee. Stanley-Whitman House, accessed 10/2/11. In addition to farming a lot along the fertile banks of the Farmington River, Smith was also a professional weaver. His account book (currently in the collection of the Connecticut Historical Society Museum and Library) provides information about the types, patterns, and cost of the textiles he produced during his lifetime. While occupying the homestead, Thomas and Mary Smith had five of their eventual 12 children. In 1735, the Smiths sold the house to Reverend Samuel Whitman (1676‚Äì1751) for ¬£160. Reverend Whitman allowed his son Solomon (1710‚Äì1803) and new bride Susannah Cole Whitman (1715‚Äì1772) to reside in the homestead on Back Lane, as eighteenth-century High Street was then known, until officially transferring ownership of the house to his son in 1746. Solomon Whitman was a farmer and shoemaker. He also served as town clerk, justice of the peace, and probate judge in the village of Farmington. Whitman sat at the Hartford assembly and oversaw the town's first subscription library. In 1772, six months after his wife Susannah's death, Solomon relocated to Main Street, although his descendants continued to occupy the house until 1922. Whitman descendant Henry Farnam, nephew of Yale University economics professor Henry Walcott Farnam (1853‚Äì1933), inherited the house in 1886. Working in tandem with his grandmother Ann Sophia Whitman (1816‚Äì1901), the younger Farnam commissioned architect Leoni W. Robinson (1851‚Äì?) to restore the 166-year-old house sometime between 1900 and 1910. Among other changes, Robinson likely added the concrete ell space to the mid-eighteenth- century lean-to. In 1922, Henry Farnam sold the house to town benefactor Danford Newton Barney III (1859‚Äì1936) for $1. Barney had previously funded the construction of a town library and maintenance of the historic town green; his next philanthropic project entailed converting Stanley-Whitman House into a museum. The official transformation of house to museum would be complete by 1935. Before this stage, Barney's son Austin (1896‚Äì1971) and wife Katherine (1890‚Äì1978) moved into the house in 1924. The pair employed J. Frederick Kelly (1888‚Äì1947), a prominent architectural historian from New Haven, to supervise the restoration of the house in 1934. Kelly installed seventeenth-century style casement windows, replaced wall sheathing and floors, and even reversed the orientation of the first-floor staircase to return the house to its \\"original\\" colonial appearance. Kelly, along with everyone else, erroneously dated the house to 1660, a misconception that affected its restoration under Kelly's direction. This error was discovered and corrected in the 1980s. Museum In September 1935, Austin Barney transferred his ownership of the Stanley-Whitman House to the Farmington Village Green and Library Association. FVGLA intended that the Farmington Museum, as the Stanley-Whitman House was then known, would be \\"used [as] a museum or [for] educational purposes.\\"Stanley-Whitman House, Gallery exhibit wall text The Barney family later donated $35,000 to a fund supporting the museum. The Farmington Museum originally housed an array of Indian artifacts and colonial antiques mostly collected by former owner Katherine Barney. In 1960 the Stanley-Whitman House was designated a National Historic Landmark. Over a twenty-year period beginning in the 1970s, museum administrators reevaluated the documentary history, mission, interpretation, and even the name of the historic house. A committee led by historian Abbott Lowell Cummings, with other historians and museum professionals, looked more closely at architectural elements of the house, uncovering evidence of both original structures and more recent alterations. Researchers revisited primary source material, both confirming and refuting previously-held beliefs about the house and its occupants. A Yale University-led archaeological team examined the area surrounding the historic house, unearthing animal bones, pipe fragments, coins, and hundreds of other objects. The museum committee also discussed how to best interpret the 291-year-history of the Stanley-Whitman House. They decided to furnish the historic house to reflect two time periods: 1725 to 1735, when the Smiths occupied the house, and 1736‚Äì1772, when the first generation of Whitmans resided there. Stanley-Whitman House in 1967 The house is now marketed as a \\"living history center and museum that teaches through the collection, preservation, research, and dynamic interpretation of the history and culture of early Farmington. Programs, events, classes, and exhibits encourage visitors of all ages to immerse themselves in history by doing, acting, questioning, and engaging in Colonial life and the ideas that formed the foundation of that culture.\\" Besides offering docent-led and self-guided tours of the historic house, visitors to the Stanley-Whitman House can participate in adult and children's programs, cooking demonstrations, walking tours, and other special events. Visitors can also view modern artist installations in the Speare Classroom, conduct genealogical or local history research in the Kenneth Johnson Research Library, walk around the grounds, and enjoy the seventeenth- and eighteenth-century reproduction flower, plant, and herb gardens.

She made her debut screen appearance in the pilot episode \\"In The Hands Of Giants Pt 1\\", which was broadcast on 28 August 2007. Casting Shortly after she returned to Australia from a four month stay in London, Garner was offered the chance to audition for the role of Jennifer. Of her casting, she said \\"It looked like a strong production, the cast was exceptional, the chance to play a strong female lead on a commercial network on a show I think has a lot of credibility; it wasn't something to turn down.\\" Garner filmed the pilot for City Homicide in 2006. The Seven Network commissioned the series the following year and Paul Kalina of The Age commented that the network bosses were \\"very pleased\\" with Garner's performance. Garner revealed that it was \\"nice\\" to be working in her home town of Melbourne, as it meant she could go home every night instead of returning to a hotel. In 2008, Garner became pregnant with second child. She continued filming until a couple of days before her due date. She told a Herald Sun reporter \\"I was originally going to finish up after we complete this current block, but then they decided to write me into the next block. So my final day of shooting will be two days before my due date.\\" Garner took an eight-week break from the series after she gave birth and her character was absent from four episodes. Development Garner spent time with real homicide detectives to help her get a sense of the role. She told a Daily Telegraph reporter that there is a long waiting list to get into the homicide squad and that the people who chose the career had a strong morality. Of Jennifer, the reporter stated \\"Garner's character Mapplethorpe puts her career ahead of everything. She's lucky to get a gig on the sought- after homicide squad and she's not giving it up.\\" Superintendent Bernice Waverley (Noni Hazlehurst) becomes supportive of Jennifer because she thinks she adds something to the team. Storylines When the series began, Jennifer was new to Homicide and had previously been in the Fraud squad. She was meant to only be a temporary replacement for Duncan Freeman but eventually became a permanent member of the Homicide Squad. In the season 1 episode \\"Lie Down With Dogs\\" Jennifer suffered a traumatic event when she had to shoot a teenage boy dead in self-defense. However in the next episode The Return, a meeting with the boy's mother, who eventually understood that Jennifer had no choice, helped her overcome this. In the season 2 episode \\"Guilty As Charged\\", when a man on trial for murdering his wife and young daughter was found not guilty, Jennifer became determined to catch him at another crime. The man soon became as obsessed with Jennifer as she was with catching him and started stalking her and cornered her in the bush and tried to kill her. Matt and Duncan arrived in time to save her and the man received 5 years for attempted murder. Her colleagues all thought this sentence was too light, however, Jen stated that once his fellow inmates found out that he was suspected of killing his daughter, prison life would probably kill him, as men who harm children do not do well in prison. In the season 4 episode \\"Reunion\\" it is revealed that Jen and Nick Buchanan worked undercover for the SIS as Trish and Wesley Claybourne in the past and that is how they first met each other. They were both forced to go back undercover by the SIS to help prevent a terrorist attack and in the episode \\"Undercover\\" Jen is shot in the shoulder by Travis Abbott but it was just a flesh wound so she survived.

It is significant as the longtime family home Stephen Tyng Mather (1867‚Äì1930), an industrialist and conservationist who championed the creation of the National Park Service in 1916 and served as its first director. The main house was built in 1778 by his great grandfather, Deacon Mather. Stephen Mather often lived elsewhere, but regarded this house as his true home. Description and building history The Mather homestead was built in 1778 by Deacon Joseph Moses Mather. The house he built was a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, five bays wide, with a side gable roof and a central chimney. The interior layout includes a dining room and parlor beside the chimney, and a kitchen behind, flanked by two smaller rooms in the rear corners. The upstairs had a similar layout, with two rooms in front and a large unfinished space in the rear. This unfinished space was converted into bedrooms and a bathroom at an unknown date before its ownership passed to Stephen Tyng Mather in 1906. Mather made a number of alterations, giving the house a more Colonial Revival appearance. In 1927, based on designs by architect Thomas Harlan Ellett, he added a porch on the side and a two-story addition to the rear, and added the portico over the main entrance. The interior of the main block retained its original character through these changes, but the old kitchen space was converted into a living room. Mather also had a sunken garden built, along with a caretaker's cottage (replaced later by a guest house) and a carriage barn. The house was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1963, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1966.. The landmark includes three adjacent land parcels owned by Mather, plus a the family cemetery in which Mather is buried. Significance Stephen Tyng Mather was born in California, educated at the University of California, and was a successful industrialist in the manufacture and processing of borax. He became interested in the condition of the nation's parks and public lands in 1904, expressing his concern in a letter to his friend Franklin Lane, the United States Secretary of the Interior. Lane responded by offering him a government post overseeing the parks, which Mather accepted in 1915. His lobbying of legislators and the press was instrumental in raising the profile of the park system, and resulted in the formal establishment of the National Park Service in 1916 with Mather as its director. Mather oversaw the establishment of the services policies and practices, as well as the addition of numerous parks into the system. He retired in 1929 and died the following year.

He was born in Merseburg, the fifth (but second surviving) son of Christian II, Duke of Saxe- Merseburg, and Erdmuthe Dorothea of Saxe-Zeitz. Life Maurice Wilhelm succeeded his older brother Christian III Maurice, Duke of Saxe-Merseburg, when he died on 14 November 1694 after only twenty-five days of rule. As he was only six years of age at the time, his mother, the dowager duchess Erdmuthe Dorothea, acted as regent until he reached his majority in 1712. Until then, the administration of the duchy was supervised by the Elector Frederick Augustus I of Saxony. The custody of the young duke, whoever, was actually in the hands of the dowager duchess Erdmuthe Dorothea, who took an interest in the government of the duchy until 1709, and his uncle August, Duke of Saxe-Merseburg-Z√∂rbig.

It is a game for two to six players and is based partly on luck with a die and partly on strategy. It is similar to the game Ludo and is nominally a children's game. The game Each player has four conical, or hat-shaped, playing pieces all of the same colour that start off in their home 'base'. The object is to move out of your base, capture, or 'cop', your opponent's pieces by landing on top of them, carry them back to your base, and 'imprison' them there. A player can have any number of pieces out of their base at any time. However, while you are moving back to 'base' with a captured piece other players may in turn capture your piece. The winner is the last player to have an uncaptured piece. There are a few squares on the board that are of a different colour to the rest; if a piece is on these squares it cannot be captured.Rules of game and pictures of the board References Category:Board games introduced in 1927 Category:Children's board games Category:Roll-and-move board games Category:Cross and circle games Category:Running-fight board games ","title":"Coppit"},{"id":"13589906","text":"The William Williams House is a historic house in Lebanon, Connecticut, at the junction of Connecticut Routes 87 and 207. A National Historic Landmark, it is significant as the residence, from 1755 until his death, of William Williams (1731‚Äì1811), who was a delegate from Connecticut to the Continental Congress and a signer of the U.S. Declaration of Independence. It is a well-preserved and little-altered colonial-era house. Description and history The Williams house is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, five bays wide and two deep, with a side gable roof, twin interior chimneys, and clapboard siding. Its main entrance, centered on the front facade has a Greek Revival surround, with sidelight windows and pilasters flanking the door, topped by a cornice with a carved elliptical arch. A single-story ell extends to the rear of the house. The interior follows a center hall plan, and retains original features, including fireplace mantels (although most of the fireplaces have been closed up), and wide pine flooring.. The house's construction date and original owner are not known. It was purchased in 1748 by Reverend Solomon Williams, who gave it to his son William in 1755. William (born 1731) was trained at Harvard College, and saw provincial militia duty in the French and Indian War in 1755. He settled in Lebanon that year, and embarked on career as a merchant, jurist, and politician. He served in the provincial assembly 1757-76 and the state legislature 1781-84. He was a steadfast supporter of independence during the American Revolution, working closely with his father- in-law, Lebanon native and Governor of Connecticut Jonathan Trumbull. Williams personally funded Connecticut militia that captured Fort Ticonderoga in 1775. He was elected to the Second Continental Congress, where he signed the United States Declaration of Independence and the Articles of Confederation. He was a delegate to the 1788 state convention that ratified the United States Constitution. Williams' house was also directly involved in the war effort during the revolution. In the winter of 1780-81, the French cavalry forces of Lauzun's Legion were stationed in Lebanon. Williams' house was allotted to Lauzun's second-in-command, Robert Dillon, during this time. The house was declared a National Historic Landmark and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971.

Publication history Thomas Lightner first appeared as Blacksun in Marvel Two-in-One #21-23 (November 1976-January 1977), and was created by Bill Mantlo and Ron Wilson. The character subsequently appears in Marvel Two-in-One #42 (August 1978), #53-57 (July-December 1979), and became known as the Nth Man in Marvel Two-in-One #58 (December 1979). The character appears in the Squadron Supreme: Death of a Universe graphic novel (1989), Quasar #13 (August 1990), #19 (February 1991), and became known as Mysterium in the Squadron Supreme: New World Order graphic novel (September 1998). The character received an entry in the All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z #7 (2006). Fictional character biography Dr. Thomas Lightner was a scientist who rebuilt his father's Sky Cannon after his father Raymond disappeared during a mishap with the device. A similar mishap with the rebuilt device caused the energies from Raymond to merge with Thomas, giving Thomas the powers of a black hole. Thomas' body could not contain these vast energies for long, and he collapsed and returned to his normal form. Lightner was later contacted by the Nth Command to infiltrate and sabotage Project: Pegasus. Lightner hoped to use the project's Nth Projector to regain his previous powers. Lightner released Nuklo and allowed Thundra and the Grapplers in to cause destruction and distract the facility's staff. Lightner was supposed to use the Nth Projector to send the Project: Pegasus facility into another dimension, but instead used it on himself. Lightner was transformed into the Nth Man, a \\"living interdimensional vortex\\". Like a black hole, the Nth Man absorbs all nearby matter and energy into himself. All of the heroes at the facility were absorbed into him, and Wundarr the Aquarian was able to use his null field to shut off the Nth Man's powers.Marvel Two-in-One #58 Instead of being destroyed, the Nth Man entered the alternate universe of Earth-S.

It is an autofocus camera made in three colors: raspberry red, mocha brown, and silver. In Japan it was also available in a mix of black and white colors. As with other Finepix models, the Z5fd was also extensively promoted in Japan by Yuri \\"Ebi-chan\\" Ebihara. The camera uses a non- protruding, folded optics design Fujinon 3√ó zoom lens system (F3.5‚ÄìF4.2) with a focal length of F6.1-18.3 mm which is equivalent to 36‚Äì108 mm on a 35 mm camera. Specifications It has 6.3 megapixels, a 1/2.5\\" Super CCD HR sensor and 3√ó optical zoom. Its ISO range is up to 1600. It uses Real Processor II, face recognition and has 26 MB of internal memory. It supports xD-Picture Cards, USB 2.0 and Intelligent flash. Photography mode Sliding the lens cover and the camera turns itself on very quickly and the front \\"Z5\\" lettering illuminates. The all-metal-bodied camera is then ready to take pictures in seconds. External controls around the camera are straightforward and easy to use for normal everyday users. However, the buttons are almost flat against the back panel making them a bit difficult to assume they were pressed. For more advanced settings, users must use Fujifilm's menu system. The rear of the camera has a large LCD TFT display with 230,000 pixels that display images in high quality and a high frame rate of 60 frame/s (Frame rate can be changed from 15, 30, and 60). Zoom control is actuated by the thumb and can zoom up to 18.5√ó (3√ó optical and 6.2√ó digital). The Fujinon lens is sharp compared to other ultra slim folded optic cameras from other manufacturers and takes vivid images. The Z5fd's autofocus system is quicker than one expects from a camera of this price and range. The face detection system locates faces by highlighting them in a green box. Up to ten different faces can be detected at one time for easy focusing. Pressing the small shutter release button to take photos. Unfortunately, the Z5fd does not have an aperture or shutter priority setting, but the user can change ISO setting, white balance, and exposure compensation. Fujifilm supplies a 14-pin USB cord and utilizes fast USB 2.0 hardware to upload images to a computer. Unlike other camera manufacturers which supply a wall charger, charging the battery on the Z5fd uses the same 14-pin port on the camera combined with an AC adapter from Fujifilm. Movie mode The movie mode is turned on by a switch on top of the camera next to the shutter release button. Movies are recorded in AVI format (motion JPEG) with monaural sound. Picture quality is good with Fine resolution set as 640√ó480 at 30 frame/s. Other resolution setting is 320√ó240 at 30 frame/s for long movie recording. Power requirements The standard USB cable supplied with the camera does not provide power. The connector on the camera is a proprietary shape captive cable. Both the power supply and the data cable use the same 14-pin connector. The power supply label says 5 volts at 1.5 amp. The camera label says 5 volts at 3 watts. Battery is a lithium Ion type rated at 3.7 v and 750 mAh (Fujifilm OEM model number NP-40). Criticism With its small sensor size, different exterior color options and no aperture and shutter priority modes, this camera is being said by critics as a female users' camera. Although this camera has a picture stabilization feature called \\"Anti-Blur\\", there is no mechanical stabilizer such as optical or CCD-shift stabilization. The camera only changes its sensitivity to ISO 1600 and high shutter speed. Face detection works well, but only if the person(s) in the image is not wearing headwear such as hats, sunglasses, or even eyeglasses and is facing directly into the camera. Some users have experienced pink fringing or pink vertical bands along the left side of the image. Fujifilm along with the Super CCD has been known for this problem and has yet to fix the problem completely. Fujifilm's proprietary xD-Picture cards are expensive compared to SD and CF counterparts and as of 2009 the largest size available to consumers is only 2 GB.

According to a source within the Hawks organization, Wirtz \\"believes in spending money to make money,\\" in marked contrast to his father's frugal management style. Wirtz stated in an interview that he would keep Dale Tallon as Blackhawks general manager and Denis Savard as head coach. He also affirmed at the time that Bob Pulford would remain as the team's senior vice president, but later reassigned him to Blackhawks liaison on NHL affairs. (Savard would be fired as head coach just four games into the 2008‚Äì09 season and replaced by Joel Quenneville.) On October 22, 2007, Wirtz announced the team negotiated with Comcast SportsNet Chicago (now known as NBC Sports Chicago, of which he is part-owner) to televise home games. This was another break from his father's management style, where games were previously unavailable on television unless they were nationally televised, which only happened in the playoffs. That season, they began to show 7 home games, with Wirtz citing pre-existing agreements Comcast had with other programming as a reason why the remaining 2007‚Äì08 home schedule cannot be shown. Wirtz hired former Chicago Cubs team president John McDonough, to become the new President of the team. Many believed that McDonough's presence, along with the young talent on the roster, would improve the team's marketing ability and reverse a long drought in popularity. This became evident when the team ranked 1st in the NHL for attendance in 2008‚Äì09 {http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/attendance?year=2009} while making it to the Western Conference Finals. The team also hosted the Detroit Red Wings in the 2009 NHL Winter Classic at Wrigley Field that season. Former star players Bobby Hull and Stan Mikita, who were not on good terms with the elder Wirtz, returned to the team in the role of \\"ambassadors\\". A big step showing this reconciliation was when the Blackhawks celebrated Hull and Mikita together at the United Center on Friday, March 7, 2008. While most of Wirtz's changes were met with positive results, one decision was met with skepticism was his decision to lessen the use of the United Center's organ in favor of more prerecorded current music to attract new, younger fans. This ended up being a blessing in disguise as the goal song \\"Chelsea Dagger\\" became a song other teams loved to hate. The Blackhawks didn't take long to turn around under the younger Wirtz' stewardship. After missing the playoffs for six straight seasons (and seven of the last eight), the team enjoyed a resurgence in 2009. Having built the team around a core of Patrick Kane, Jonathan Toews, Duncan Keith, and Brent Seabrook, the Blackhawks recorded their first 100-point season in 16 years. They defeated the Calgary Flames and the Vancouver Canucks in the first two rounds before bowing out to the defending Stanley Cup Champions, Detroit Red Wings, in the Western Conference Final. In the 2010 Stanley Cup Playoffs, the Blackhawks defeated the Nashville Predators, Vancouver Canucks and San Jose Sharks to advance to their first Stanley Cup Final since 1992. They faced the Philadelphia Flyers in the Stanley Cup Final and won the Stanley Cup in six games on June 9, 2010. This was the first Stanley Cup for the Blackhawks since 1961, thus ending the second longest Stanley Cup drought in the history of the NHL. In the 2013 Stanley Cup Playoffs, the Blackhawks eliminated the Minnesota Wild, Detroit Red Wings, and 2012 Stanley Cup Champion Los Angeles Kings to reach the Finals. There they defeated the 2011 Stanley Cup Champion Boston Bruins in six games, giving the Blackhawks a second championship in four seasons. This marked the first game between Western and Eastern Conference teams all season due to the 2012‚Äì13 NHL lockout-shortened season. This also marked the first time since 1979 for an all Original Six Cup Final. Shortly after this championship, Wirtz and John McDonough, president and CEO of the Blackhawks, took out a full-page ad in the Boston Globe thanking the city of Boston for respect and sportsmanship during the Cup Finals and praising their recovery from the Boston Marathon bombing. Last accessed June 28, 2013. In the 2015 Stanley Cup Playoffs, the Blackhawks eliminated the Nashville Predators, Minnesota Wild, and Anaheim Ducks to reach the Finals. There, they defeated the Tampa Bay Lightning in six games, giving the Blackhawks a third championship in six seasons.

He received a medical degree in surgery from Padua, and furthered his studies at Bologna and Pavia. In 1809 he became a professor at the University of Pavia, and in 1835 a member of the Academia nazionale delle scienze (National Academy of Science). Panizza was a student and associate to famed anatomist Antonio Scarpa (1752-1832). He was the first physician to attribute the vision function to the posterior cortex. He published his findings in an 1855 treatise titled \\"Osservazioni sul nervo ottico\\" (Observations on the Optic Nerve). At the time, his discovery was largely ignored, and it would be several years until the importance of Panizza's findings were realized. In 1833 he described the \\"foramen of Panizza\\", defined as a hole with a valve that connects the left and right aorta in the crocodilian heart. He is also remembered for studies involving the lymphatic system of reptiles. The eponymous \\"Panizza's plexuses\\" are defined as two plexuses of lymph vessels located in the lateral fossae of the frenulum of the prepuce. Panizza died in 1867 in Pavia.

USS Clay was originally laid down as Sea Angel by the Western Pipe and Steel Company on 14 October 1942. The vessel was launched on 23 January 1943 and commissioned into the US Navy as naval transport USS Clay AP-84 on 29 June 1943. The ship then sailed from San Pedro to New York, where she was decommissioned for conversion on 11 August 1943, and recommissioned into service as an attack transport designated APA-39 on 21 December 1943, after which she sailed to Pearl Harbor in preparation for operations against the Japanese. Operational history =Saipan= After an abortive operation against Kavieng (cancelled due to neutralization of the Japanese forces there by other means), USS Clay headed to Saipan, where on the morning of 15 June 1944 she participated in a feint landing off the island's northwestern coast in order to draw Japanese troops away from the real landing zone. On the afternoon of the same day, Clay participated in the invasion proper, landing elements of the 2nd Marine Division. Clay then returned to Pearl Harbor with troops and Japanese prisoners of war, arriving on 9 July. Clays naval division was then ordered to San Diego to embark the 5th Marine Division for an attack on Guam, but during the trip Guam fell to US forces and the ship was diverted to Hawaii in preparation for a new operation. =Leyte= After intensive rehearsals, USS Clay then embarked with elements of the 96th Infantry Division for an attack on Yap, but once again the course of the war made the invasion unnecessary and the ship was ordered to participate in an invasion of Leyte instead, 700 miles beyond. The vessel staged at Manus and on 14 October set sail as part of a large invasion force, taking part in the invasion on 20 October. Under constant threat from Japanese aircraft, Clay then sailed from Leyte to Hollandia and thence Morotai, before returning to Leyte with vital reinforcements and supplies. The vessel unloaded in a single day and on 14 November proceeded once again to Manus, then to Cape Gloucester, where following her arrival on 27 November, she began to prepare for the invasion of Luzon in Lingayen Gulf. =Luzon= On 31 December 1944, USS Clay departed for the invasion of Luzon. In the face of kamikaze air attacks, the invasion was successfully carried out on 9 January. Clay herself helped beat off the suicide attacks, and the Japanese erroneously reported her sinking. Clay then returned to Leyte to embark elements of the 1st Cavalry Division, which she also transported to Luzon, arriving on 27 January. After taking on board wounded soldiers, Clay then set sail for Guadalcanal to embark elements of the 6th Marines. =Okinawa= After more rehearsals, USS Clay embarked in March with elements of the 6th Marines as part of the massive invasion fleet destined for Okinawa. Braving attacking planes and gunfire, the invasion took place on 1 April. By 5 April Clay was returning home to San Francisco for an overhaul and an increase in her armament in preparation for the invasion of Japan. While in port she also received a new commanding officer, Captain E. M. Eller, and refresher training at San Diego. =After the Japanese surrender= On 27 July USS Clay headed once more for the Pacific, but before she could arrive the US unleashed its atomic bombs on Nagasaki and Hiroshima and the Japanese surrendered. Clay continued to Leyte, and from there to Cebu where she embarked elements of 182nd Infantry Regiment for occupation duties in Japan. On 1 September, she sailed for Tokyo Bay as flagship of Temporary Squadron 13 (part of Tokyo Force), skippered by Squadron Commander Captain R C Bartham. Sailing through swept minefields and past the wreck of the Japanese battleship Nagato, USS Clay disembarked her cargo in the devastated industrial region between Yokohama and Tokyo, before returning to Cebu and thence to Otaru with more occupation troops. She then journeyed to Guam to pick up occupation troops for Tientsin, China. From there she sailed to Saipan to embark troops returning home to the United States, arriving at San Pedro on 5 December 1945. After a second trip to the Pacific to pick up more returning servicemen, she sailed from San Francisco on 9 March 1946 and arrived at New York on 27 March. She was decommissioned on 15 May 1946 . In the course of her naval career, USS Clay covered over 100,000 miles in wartime operations. She received four battle stars for her wartime service. =Commercial service= After decommissiong, the vessel was sold through the Maritime Commission on 12 September 1946 to American President Lines, which renamed her SS President Johnson. By the 1970s she had been sold again, to Waterman Steamship Corporation, and renamed SS La Salle. The vessel was finally scrapped in 1974.

It is the only middle school in Trussville City Schools and is named for the early local educator Robert Hewitt. School colors are red and gray, and the athletic teams are called the Huskies. All students from Cahaba, Magnolia, and Paine Elementary Schools are zoned to attend HTMS upon entering the sixth grade. HTMS students feed into Hewitt-Trussville High School upon entering the ninth grade.  History  When Hewitt-Trussville High School was relocated to a new campus in 1984, its existing facility at 301 Parkway Drive was converted into a new middle school serving grades 5-7. Students from Hewitt Elementary School entered HTMS in the fifth grade and students from Clay and Chalkville Elementary Schools entered HTMS in the seventh grade. This continued until 1996, when Clay-Chalkville Middle School opened to serve students from Clay and Chalkville Elementary Schools. From 1984 until 2001, HTMS students went on to attend Hewitt- Trussville Junior High School for the eighth grade. A sinkhole on the Hewitt- Trussville Junior High School campus resulted in that facility being demolished in 2002, moving the 9th grade to Hewitt-Trussville High School and the 8th grade to HTMS. Like other schools in Trussville, HTMS was part of the Jefferson County School District until the City of Trussville formed its own school system in 2005. Trussville has constructed three elementary schools since breaking away from the Jefferson County School System, and all three of these feed into HTMS. In 2008, a new Hewitt-Trussville High School facility opened off Deerfoot Parkway, at which point HTMS relocated to the former high school campus on Trussville Clay Road.

Tried at the Lahore Conspiracy trial, Sohan Singh served sixteen years of a life sentence for his part in the conspiracy before he was released in 1930. He later worked closely with the Indian labour movement, devoting considerable time to the Kisan Sabha and the Communist Party of India. Early life Sohan Singh was born on 22 January 1870 at the village of Khutrai Khurd, north of Amritsar, which was the ancestral home of his mother Ram Kaur. His father was Bhai Karam Singh, who lived with his family in the village of Bhakna, 16 km southwest of Amritsar. He was born into a Shergill Jat family. Young Sohan Singh spent his childhood at Bhakhna, where he received his childhood education in the village Gurudwara and by the Arya Samaj. He learnt to read and write in the Punjabi language at an early age, and was also instructed on the rudiments of Hindu and Sikh traditions. Sohan Singh was married at the age of ten to Bishan Kaur, daughter of a landlord near Lahore by the name of Khushal Singh. Sohan Singh finished primary school at the age of sixteen in 1896, which he started at age eleven when primary school was first opened in his village, by which time he was also proficient in Urdu and Persian. Sohan Singh became involved in the nationalist movement and the agrarian unrest that emerged in Punjab in the 1900s. He participated in the protests against the anti-Colonization Bill in 1906-07. Two years later, in February 1909, he left home to sail for the United States. After a two-month journey, Singh reached Seattle on 4 April 1909. United States Sohan Singh soon found work as a labourer in a timber mill being constructed near the city. In this first decade of the 1900s, the Pacific coast of North America saw large scale Indian immigration. A large proportion of the immigrants were especially from Punjab British India which was facing an economic depression and agrarian unrest. The Canadian government met this influx with a series of legislations aimed at limiting the entry of South Asians into Canada, and restricting the political rights of those already in the country. The Punjabi community had hitherto been an important loyal force for the British Empire and the Commonwealth, and the community had expected, to honour its commitment, equal welcome and rights from the British and commonwealth governments as extended to British and white immigrants. These legislations fed growing discontent, protests and anti-colonial sentiments within the community. Faced with increasingly difficult situations, the community began organising itself into political groups. A large number of Punjabis also moved to the United States, but they encountered similar political and social problems. Early works among these groups date back to the time around 1908 when Indian students and Punjabi immigrants of the likes of P S Khankhoje, Pandit Kanshi Ram, Taraknath Das and Bhai Bhagwan Singh were working towards and for a political movement. Khankhoje himself founded the Indian Independence League in Portland, Oregon. Sohan Singh at this time came to be strongly associated with this political movement taking shape among Indian immigrants. His works also brought him close to other Indian nationalists in United States at the time. Meanwhile, India House and nationalist activism of Indian students had begun declining in the East Coast towards 1910, but gradually shifted west to San Francisco. The arrival at this time of Har Dayal from Europe bridged the gap between the intellectual agitators in New York and the predominantly Punjabi labour workers and migrants in the west coast, and laid the foundations of the Ghadar movement. In the summer of 1913, representatives of Indians living in Canada and the United States met at Stockton, where the decision was taken to establish an organization, Hindustani Workers of the Pacific Coast. The Pacific Coast Hindustan Association, was formed in 1913 in the United States under the leadership of Har Dayal, P.S. Khankhoje and Sohan Singh Bhakna. Bhakna was its president. It drew members from Indian immigrants, largely from Punjab. Many of its members were also from the University of California at Berkeley including Dayal, Tarak Nath Das, Kartar Singh Sarabha and V.G. Pingle. The party quickly gained support from Indian expatriates, especially in the United States, Canada and Asia. Ghadar meetings were held in Los Angeles, Oxford, Vienna, Washington, D.C., and Shanghai. Ghadar Movement The Ghadar Party evolved from the Pacific Coast Hindustan Association. The Ghadar's ultimate goal was to overthrow British colonial authority in India by means of an armed revolution. It viewed the Congress-led mainstream movement for dominion status modest and the latter's constitutional methods as soft. Ghadar's foremost strategy was to entice Indian soldiers to revolt. To that end, in November 1913 Ghadar established the Yugantar Ashram press in San Francisco. The press produced the Hindustan Ghadar newspaper and other nationalist literature. The Ghadar leadership,under Sohan Singh Bhakna, began at this time their first plans for mutiny. The inflammatory passions surrounding the Komagata Maru incident helped the Ghadarite cause, and Ghadar leaders including Sohan Singh, Barkatullah and Taraknath Das used it as a rallying point and successfully brought many disaffected Indians in North America into the party's fold. Sohan Singh himself had contacted the returning Komagata Maru at Yokohama and delivered to Baba Gurdit Singh a consignment of arms when he learnt of hostilities breaking out in July 1914. The war in Europe hastened Ghadar's plans. It was already in touch with Indian revolutionaries in Germany and with the German consulate in San Francisco. Ghadar also had party members in South- East Asia and had made contact with the Indian revolutionary underground. Elaborate plans were made to ship funds and arms from the United States and from South-East Asia, to India in what came to be called the Hindu German Conspiracy. These were to be used for a planned mutiny in India sometime in late 1914 or early 1915. The plans for the latter came to be known as the Ghadar Conspiracy. Sohan Singh, as one of the top of the Ghadar leadership, sailed to India in the SS Namsang at the outbreak of the war, in the wake of the Komagata Maru incidence to organise and direct the rebellion from India. However, British intelligence was already picking up traces of the revolutionary conspiracy. Returning to India, Singh was arrested in Calcutta on 13 October 1914 and sent to Ludhiana for interrogation. He was subsequently sent to the Central Jail in Multan and later tried in the Lahore Conspiracy Case and sentenced to death, with forfeiture of property. The death sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment in the Andamans, where he reached on 10 December 1915 and where he undertook several hunger strikes successively to secure the detainees better treatment. Later life In 1921, Sohan Singh was transferred to Coimbatore jail and then to Yervada. Here however, Singh embarked on a hunger strike in protest against Sikh prisoners not being allowed to wear turbans and their Kacchera, amongst their religious obligations. In 1927, he was shifted to the Central Jail at Lahore, where he again went on hunger strike in June 1928 to protest against the segregation of the so-called low-caste Mazhabi Sikhs from other 'high-caste' Sikhs during meals. In 1929, while still interned, he went on a hunger strike in support of Bhagat Singh. He ultimately served sixteen years before he was released early in July 1930. After his release, he continued working in the nationalist movement and labour politics. His works were identified closely with the works of the Communist party of India, devoting most of his time to organizing the Kisan Sabhas. He also made the release of interned Ghadarites a key part of his political work. He was interned a second time during World War II, when he was jailed at the Deoli Camp in what is today Rajasthan. He remained incarcerated for nearly three years. After Independence he veered decisively towards the Communist Party of India. He was arrested on 31 March 1948, but released on 8 May 1948. However, he was seized again, but jail-going ended for him finally at the intervention of Independent India's first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru.

It is the dextrorotatory stereoisomer of ketoprofen. Medical uses Short-term treatment of mild to moderate pain, including dysmenorrhoea. It is also used for migraines and knee pain. Side effects It may cause dizziness, and patients should not, therefore, drive or operate heavy machinery or vehicles until they are familiar with how dexketoprofen affects them. Concomitant use of alcohol and other sedatives may potentiate this effect. In a small subset of individuals the dizziness may be intolerable and require transition to an alternative treatment. Pharmacology Dexketoprofen belongs to a class of medicines called NSAIDs. It works by blocking the action of a substance in the body called cyclo-oxygenase, which is involved in the production of chemicals in the body called prostaglandins. Prostaglandins are produced in response to injury or certain diseases and would otherwise go on to cause swelling, inflammation and pain. By blocking cyclo-oxygenase, dexketoprofen prevents the production of prostaglandins and therefore reduces inflammation and pain. Along with peripheral analgesic action, it possesses central analgesic action.

Porter wrote to Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles reporting the purchase and recommending that her name be changed to Antelope. Apparently, he had acquired the ship to meet Rear Admiral Farragut's need for light-draft gunboats and had her hull covered with iron plates by naval shipfitters at Mound City, Illinois. Blockade duty Antelope first appears on the list of vessels composing the West Gulf Blockading Squadron on 15 August 1864 with the notation that she was then at New Orleans, Louisiana. Her service in this role proved exceptionally short-lived. Flooding Within three weeks of entering service Antelope began to chronically flood. The paperwork on her purchase was finally completed on 31 August 1864. By 4 September, under command of Acting Master John Ross, she was at Pass a l‚ÄôOutre where she had relieved the sidewheeler Meteor. While there, she began taking on considerable water; and her leaks steadily increased. An inspection of the inside of her hull revealed that \\". . . the leak was not confined to any one place, but extended to all parts of the bottom sides.\\" After she had been on station for a full week, Ross reported \\". . . the condition of the vessel and that I was obliged to keep up 60 pounds of steam to work the steam pumps, as we could not keep her free by the hand pumps.\\" The ship was relieved as soon as possible and ordered back to New Orleans, Louisiana, for repairs. On the evening of 22 September, during her trip upriver, Antelope came upon the Army transport Suffolk‚Äîabandoned and in a sinking condition‚Äîand towed her to shoal water where she would be safe on the flats. Antelope then resumed her ascent of the river. Loss About 4:30 a.m. on 23 September 1864 Ross learned his ship was sinking. He ordered the helm hard aport to beach her. While filling rapidly, Antelope grounded enabling her crew to save her ordnance and equipment. No record of efforts to salvage the ship has been found.

It is closely related to naproxen, which is also an NSAID. Flunoxaprofen has been shown to significantly improve the symptoms of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. The clinical use of flunoxaprofen has ceased due to concerns of potential hepatotoxicity. Structure Flunoxaprofen is a two-ring heterocyclic compound derived from benzoxazole. It also contains a fluorine atom and a propanoyl group. Synthesis and preparation Synthesis of flunoxaprofen can be seen here Because flunoxaprofen has limited water-solubility, additional steps must be taken in order to prepare syrups, creams, suppositories, etc. In order to make flunoxaprofen water-soluble, yet still active and efficient, it must be mixed with lysine and then suspended in an organic solvent that is soluble in water. A salt will crystallize upon cooling. The salt must then be filtered out and dried. Pharmacological testing of this now water-soluble compound has shown that it has anti-inflammatory properties equal to flunoxaprofen by itself.\\"Preparation process for making water-soluble lysine salts of (+)2-(4-fluorophenyl)-alpha-methyl-5-benzoxazole acetic acid\\" Pharmacokinetics The efficacy and safety of flunoxaprofen has been compared with those of Naproxen in rheumatoid arthritis patients to show that the two drugs have equivalent therapeutical effects. Both drugs significantly relieve spontaneous pain which occurs both during the day and at night. Both drugs also significantly relive the pain associated with active and passive motion and aid in relieving morning stiffness. The study also showed both drugs to be equally effective at improving grip strength. Flunoxaprofen has two enantiomers. The absorption and siposition of both enantiomers were studied in 1988. No significant differences were seen between the absorption and elimination half-lives between the two. However, further studies have shown that the S-enantiomer is the active form of the drug. Flunoxaprofen is pharmacologically activated through biotransformation of the R-enantiomer to the S-enantiomer. This highly stereoselective chiral inversion is mediated by the FLX-S-Acyl-CoA thioester. Pharmacokinetic studies have been carried out by determining the level of propranolol enantiomers in the plasma after administering the racemic drug orally. It has been shown that the dextrorotatory form is particularly active and has a much higher therapeutic index than some other anti-inflammatories, including indomethacin and diclofenac. It has also been shown that flunoxaprofen inhibits leukotriene rather than prostaglandin synthesis. This is similar to benoxaprofen. Flunoxaprofen and benoxaprofen have been shown to have similar absorption characteristics. However, the distribution and elimination of flunoxaprofen has been shown to be much faster than benoxaprofen. Adverse effects A structural analog of flunoxaprofen is benoxaprofen. The two drugs are carboxylic acid analogs that form reactive acyl glucuronides. Benoxaprofen has been shown to be involved in rare hepatotoxicity. Because of this, benoxaprofen has been removed from the market. In response to this the clinical use of flunoxaprofen has also stopped, even though studies have shown that flunoxaprofen is less toxic than benoxaprofen. The toxicity of these nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may be related to the covalent modification of proteins in response to the drugs' reactive acyl glucuronides. The reactivity of the acyl glucuronides can affect the protein binding.

It is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and was marketed under the brand name Oraflex in the United States and as Opren in Europe by Eli Lilly and Company. Lilly suspended sales of Oraflex in 1982 after reports from the British government and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of adverse effects and deaths linked to the drug.  History  Benoxaprofen was discovered by a team of Lilly chemists at its British laboratory. This laboratory was assigned to explore new anti-arthritic compounds in 1966. Lilly applied for patents on benoxaprofen seven years later and also filed for permission from the FDA to start testing the drug on humans. It had to undergo the three-step clinical testing procedure required by the Federal Government. Lilly began Phase I of the progress by testing a handful of healthy human volunteers. These tests had to prove that the drug posed no clear and immediate safety hazards. In Phase II a larger number of human subjects, including some with minor illnesses, was tested. The drug‚Äôs effectiveness and safety was the major target of these tests. Phase III was the largest test and began in 1976. More than 2,000 arthritis patients were administered the drug by more than 100 physicians. The physicians reported the results to the Lilly Company. When the company formally requested to begin marketing the drug in January 1980 with the FDA, the document consisted of more than 100,000 pages of test results and patients‚Äô records. Benoxaprofen was first marketed abroad: in 1980 the drug was released for marketing in the UK. It came on the market in May 1982 in the USA. When benoxaprofen was on the market as Oraflex in the USA the first sign of trouble came for the Lilly Company. The British Medical Journal reported in May 1982 that physicians in the UK believed that the drug was responsible for at least 12 deaths, mainly caused by kidney and liver failure. A petition was filed to have Oraflex removed from the market. On the fourth of August 1982 the British government temporarily suspended sales of the drug in UK ‚Äòon grounds of safety‚Äô. The British Committee on the Safety of Medicines declared, in a telegram to the FDA, that it had received reports of more than 3,500 adverse side-effects among patients who had used Oraflex. There were also 61 deaths, most of which were of elderly people. Almost simultaneously, the FDA said it had reports of 11 deaths in the USA among Oraflex users, most of which were caused by kidney and liver damage. The Eli Lilly Company suspended sales of benoxaprofen that afternoon.  Structure and reactivity  The molecular formula of benoxaprofen is C16H12ClNO3 and the systematic (IUPAC) name is 2-[2-(4-chlorophenyl)-1,3-benzoxazol-5-yl]propionic acid. The molecule has a molecular mass of 301.050568 g/mol. Benoxaprofen is essentially a planar molecule. This is due to the co-planarity of the benzoxazole and phenyl rings, but the molecule also has a non-planar side chain consisting of the propanoic acid moiety which acts as a carrier group. These findings were obtained from X-ray crystallographic measurements made at the Lilly Research Centre. Benoxaprofen is highly phototoxic. The free radical decarboxylated derivative of the drug is the toxic agent which, in the presence of oxygen, yields singlet oxygen and superoxy anion. Irradiation of benoxaprofen in an aqueous solution causes photochemical decarboxylation via a radical mechanism and in single-strand breaks of DNA. This also happens to ketoprofen and naproxen, other NSAIDs, which are even more active in this respect than benoxaprofen.  Available forms  Benoxaprofen is a racemic mixture [(RS)-2-(p-chlorophenyl- a-methyl-5-benzoxazoleacetic acid]. The two enantiomers are R(-) and S(+). The inversion of the R(-) enantiomer and glucuronide conjugation will metabolize benoxaprofen. However, benoxaprofen will not readily undergo oxidative metabolism. It is however possible that, when cytochrome P4501 is the catalyst, oxygenation of the 4-chlorophyl ring occurs. With the S(+) enantiomer it is more likely that oxygenation of the aromatic ring of the 2-phenylpropionic acid moiety occurs, also here is cytochrome P4501 the catalyst.  Toxicokinetics  Benoxaprofen is absorbed well after oral intake of doses ranging from 1 up to 10 mg/kg. Only the unchanged drug is detected in the plasma, mostly bound to plasma proteins.[6] The plasma levels of benoxaprofen in eleven subjects have been accurately predicted, based on the two-compartment open model. The mean half-life of absorption was 0.4 hours. This means that within 25 minutes, half of the dose is absorbed in the system. The mean half-life of distribution was 4.8 hours. This means that within 5 hours, half of the dose is distributed throughout the entire system. The mean half-life of elimination was 37.8 hours. This means that within 40 hours, half of the dose is excreted out of the system. In female rats, after oral dose of 20 mg/kg, the tissue concentration of benoxaprofen was the highest in liver, kidney, lungs, adrenals and ovaries. The distribution in pregnant females is the same, while it can also be found ‚Äìin lower concentrations‚Äì in the foetus. There is a big difference between species in the route of excretion. In man, rhesus monkey and rabbit it is mostly excreted via the urine, while in rat and dog it was excreted via biliary-faecal excretion. In man and dog, the compound was excreted as the ester glucuronide, and in the other species as the unchanged compound. This means no major metabolic transformation of benoxaprofen takes place.  Toxicodynamics  Unlike other NSAIDs, benoxaprofen acts directly on mononuclear cells. It inhibits their chemotactic response by inhibiting the lipoxygenase enzyme.  Efficacy and side effects  = Efficacy = Benoxaprofen is an analgesic, antipyretic and anti- inflammatory drug. Benoxaprofen was given to patients with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis because of its anti-inflammatory effect. Patients with the Paget‚Äôs disease, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, a painful shoulder, the mixed connective-tissue disease, polymyalgia rheumatica, back pain and the Beh√ßet‚Äôs disease received benoxaprofen, too. A daily dose of 300‚Äì600 mg is effective for many patients. = Adverse effects = There are different types of side effects. Most of them were cutaneous or gastrointestinal. Side effects appear rarely in the central nervous system and miscellaneous side effects were not often observed. A study shows that most side effects appear in patients with rheumatoid arthritis  Cutaneous side effects  Cutaneous side effects of benoxaprofen are photosensitivity, onycholysis, rash, milia, increased nail growth, pruritus (itch) and hypertrichosis. Photosensitivity leads to burning, itching or redness when patients are exposed to sunlight. A study shows that benoxaprofen, or other lipoxygenase-inhibiting agents, might be helpful in the treatment of psoriasis because the migration inhibition of the inflammatory cells (leukocytes) into the skin.  Gastrointestinal side effects  Gastrointestinal side effects of benoxaprofen are bleeding, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, anorexia (symptom), mouth ulcers and taste change. According to a study the most appearing gastric side effects are vomiting, heartburn and epigastric pain.  Side effects in the central nervous system  For a small number of people, taking benoxaprofen might result in depression, lethargy and feeling ill.  Miscellaneous side effects  Faintness, dizziness, headache, palpitations, epistaxis, blurred vision, urinary urgency and gynaecomastia rarely appear in patients who take benoxaprofen. Benoxaprofen also causes hepatotoxicity, which led to death of some elderly patients. That was the main reason why the drug was withdrawn from the market.  Toxicity  After the suspension of sales in 1982 the toxic effects which benoxaprofen might have on humans were looked into more deeply. The fairly planar compound of benoxaprofen seems to be hepa- and phototoxic in the human body. Benoxaprofen has a rather long half life in man (t1/2= 20-30 h), undergoes biliary excretion and enterohepatic circulation and is also known to have a slow plasma clearance (CL p=4.5 ml/min). The half life may be further increased in elderly patients (>80 years of age) and in patients which already have an renal impairment increasing to figures as high as 148 hours. The fetal hepatotoxicity of benoxaprofen can be attributed to the accumulation of the drug after a repeated dosage and also associated with the slow plasma clearance. The hepatic accumulation of the drug is presumably the cause for an increase in the activity of the hepatic cytochrome P450I which will oxygenate benaxoprofen and produce reactive intermediates. Benoxaprofen is very likely a substrate and weak inducer of cytochrome P450I and its enzyme family. Normally it is not metabolized by oxidative reactions but with the S(+) enantiomer of benoxaprofen and cytochrome P450I as a catalyst the oxygenation of the 4-chlorophenyl ring and of the aromatic ring of 2-phenyl propionic acid seems to be possible. Therefore, the induction of a minor metabolic pathway leads to the formation of toxic metabolites in considerable amounts. The toxic metabolites may bind to vital intracellular macromolecules and may generate reactive oxygens by redox cycling if quinone is formed. This could also lead to a depletion of protective glutathione which is responsible for the detoxification of reactive oxygens. The observed skin phototoxicity of patients treated with benoxaprofen can be explained with a look at the structure of the compound. There are significant structural similarities between the benzoxazole ring of benoxaprofen and the benzafuran ring of psoralen, a compound known to be phototoxic. The free decarboxylated derivate of the drug can produce singlet oxygen and superoxy anions in the presence of oxygen. Furthermore, possible explanations for the photochemical decarboxylation and oxygen radical formation may be the accumulation of repeated dosage, the induction of cytochrome P450I and the emergence of reactive intermediates with covalent binding. The photochemical character of the compound can cause inflammation and severe tissue damage. The structure of psoralen (left) and the structure of benoxaprofen (right). The benzofuran ring and the benoxazole ring are indicated in red. In animals peroxisomal proliferation is also observed but does not seem to be significant in man.  Effects on animals  The effects of Benoxaprofen on animals were tested in a series of experiments. Benoxaprofen had a considerably anti-inflammatory, analgesic and also anti-pyretic activity in those tests. In all six animals tested, which included rats, dogs, rhesus monkeys, rabbits, guinea pigs and mice, the drug was well absorbed orally. In three of the six species benoxaprofen was then effectively taken up from the gastrointestinal tract (after oral doses of 1‚Äì10 mg/kg). The plasma half life was found to be different, being less than 13 hours in the dog, rabbit and monkey, it was notable longer in mice. Furthermore, there were species differences found in the rate and route of excretion of the compound. Whereas benoxaprofen was excreted into the urine by the rabbit and guinea pig, biliary excretion was the way of clearance found in rats and dogs. In all species only unchanged benoxaprofen was found in the plasma mostly extensively bound to proteins. The excretion of the unchanged compound into the bile did occur more slowly in rats. This is interpreted by the authors as evidence that no enterohepatic circulation takes place. Another research in rats showed that the plasma membrane of hepatocytes begun to form blebs after administration of benoxaprofen. This is suggested to be due to disturbances in the calcium concentration which is possibly a result of an altered cellular redox state which can have an effect on mitochondrial function and therefore cause disturbances in the calcium concentration. In none of the species significant levels of metabolism of benoxaprofen were found to have happened. Only in dogs glucuronide could be found in the bile which is a sure sign of metabolism in that species. Also no differences in distribution of the compound in normal and pregnant rats were found. It was shown in rats that benoxaprofen was distributed into the foetus but with a notable lower concentration than in the maternal tissue.  Synthesis  Lilly). A Sandmeyer reaction by diazotization of 2-(4-aminophenyl)propanenitrile (1) followed by acid hydrolysis leads to phenol (2), which undergoes nitration and reduction to give aminophenol (3). Hydrolysis of the nitrile and esterification produces ester 4, which is converted to benoxaprofen (5) by acylation with p-chlorobenzoyl chloride, followed by cyclization and then by saponification of the ethyl ester.

Severe but seldom side effects include bleeding, bronchospasms and the extremely rare Stevens‚ÄìJohnson syndrome.  Interactions  Interactions with other drugs are typical of NSAIDs. Combination with vitamin K antagonists like warfarin increases the risk of bleeding. Combination with ciclosporin can lead to reduced kidney function, and to acute kidney injury in rare cases. Lornoxicam can also increase the adverse effects of lithium, methotrexate and digoxin and its derivatives. The effect of diuretics, ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists can be reduced, but this is only relevant in patients with special risks like heart failure. As with piroxicam, cimetidine can increase plasma levels but is unlikely to cause relevant interactions.

It is used to relieve inflammation, swelling, stiffness, and pain associated with rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis (a type of arthritis involving the spine), tendinitis (inflammation of a tendon), bursitis (inflammation of a bursa, a fluid-filled sac located around joints and near the bones), and periarthritis of the shoulders or hips (inflammation of tissues surrounding these joints). Tenoxicam belongs to the class of NSAIDs known as oxicams. It was patented in 1974 by Roche and approved for medical use in 1987. It is available as a prescription-only drug in the United Kingdom and other countries, but not in the US. Outside the United Kingdom, tenoxicam is also marketed under brand names including Tilatil, Tilcitin, and Alganex. Contraindications The drug is contraindicated for patients who are seniors who have been given anesthesia or surgery; are at risk of increased bleeding or kidney failure; have an active inflammatory disease involving the stomach or intestine (like ulcerative colitis); have an active stomach or intestinal ulcer; have had an acute asthmatic attack, hives, rhinitis (inflammation of the inner lining of the nasal passage), or other allergic reactions caused by Aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (for example diclofenac, ibuprofen, indomethacin, naproxen).NHS Patient warnings Page accessed July 3, 2015 Common side effects that have been observed with tenoxicam include peptic ulceration, dyspepsia, nausea, constipation, abdominal pain, diarrhea, rash, headache, edema, renal failure, and vertigo.Tilcotil. (2010). New Zealand Consumer Medicine Information. http://www.medsafe.govt.nz/consumers/cmi/t/tilcotil.pdf In rare cases, tenoxicam and other NSAIDs can contribute to thrombotic events, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. = Pregnancy and breastfeeding = It is not recommended that women who are trying to conceive, who are pregnant, or who are breastfeeding take tenoxicam. Tenoxicam can be taken in the first and second trimester when necessary, but it is a contraindication in the third trimester. Some studies have looked at whether or not NSAIDs are able to enter the breast milk and the first few studies have found evidence that NSAIDs can be found in breast milk. Therefore, it is not recommended that women take tenoxicam while breastfeeding.  Interactions  Taking tenoxicam with other drugs can increase the chance of side effects or alter the therapeutic effect of tenoxicam or the other drug, depending on the combination. Drug types the tenoxicam may interact with include: other analgesic NSAIDs, salicylates such as aspirin, antacids, anticoagulants, cardiac glycosides, ciclosporin, quinolone antibiotics, lithium therapy, diuretics and anti-hypertensives, methotrexate, oral anti-diabetics, colestyramine, dextromethorphan, mifepristone, corticosteroids, anti-platelet agents and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), tacrolimus, zidovudine, and gold/penicillamine.  Mechanism of action  Like all NSAIDs, the exact mechanism of action of tenoxicam is unknown. Involved in the mechanism of action is inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2) which leads to the potential adverse effect of increased bleeding.  Society and culture  Tenoxicam is sold in the form of 20 milligram tablets with the price of treatment ranging from US$1.29-2.73 per tablet. Recommended dosing calls for tenoxicam to be taken once daily with food. One week is the typical length for treatment, but the treatment length may be extended. In 2008, the reported sales level for Tilcotil (tenoxicam) was 70 million SEK (approximately $10.5 million USD).  Research  The first members of the oxicam family of NSAIDs were brought to market in France in 1982. Shortly thereafter, tenoxicam went to phase III clinical trials for approval as use as an analgesic began in the 1980s. The general consensus from clinical studies is that tenoxicam has about equal analgesic effect as other NSAIDs and does not elicit any important side effects. More recent clinical trials for tenoxicam are examining the use of tenoxicam independently and in combination with other drugs for more specialized analgesic purposes in surgical operations such as third molar extraction and labor pains.

It is used for the relief of pain and inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. It was patented in 1983 and approved for medical use in 1992. Side effects Aceclofenac should not be given to people with porphyria or breast-feeding mothers, and is not recommended for children. It should be avoided near term in a pregnant woman because of the risk of having a premature closure of ductus arteriosus leading to fetal hydrops in the neonate. Chemistry Aceclofenac (C16H13Cl2NO4), chemically [(2-{2, 6-dichlorophenyl) amino} phenylacetooxyacetic acid], is a crystalline powder with a molecular weight of 354.19. It is practically insoluble in water with good permeability. It is metabolized in human hepatocytes and human microsomes to form [2-(2',6'-dichloro-4'-hydroxy- phenylamino) phenyl] acetoxyacetic acid as the major metabolite, which is then further conjugated. According to the Biopharmaceutical Classification System (BCS) drug substances are classified to four classes upon their solubility and permeability. Aceclofenac falls under the BCS Class II, poorly soluble and highly permeable drug. Aceclofenac works by inhibiting the action of cyclooxygenase (COX) that is involved in the production of prostaglandins (PG) which is accountable for pain, swelling, inflammation and fever. The incidence of gastric ulcerogenicity of aceclofenac has been reported to be significantly lower than that of the other frequently prescribed NSAIDs, for instance, 2-folds lesser than naproxen, 4-folds lesser than diclofenac, and 7-folds lesser than indomethacin. Society and culture =Availability= Aceclofenac is available in Europe and CIS countries. Known trades names include: Acecgen (Generics UK), Aflamin (Gedeon Richter Plc.), AklofEP (ExtractumPharma) and Flemac (Aramis Pharma). Aceclofenac is available in Hungary as a prescription only medicine. The cost of the drug is low, around 0.14 USD per 100 mg tablet ().

Continuing on his work on software visualization, between 1973 and 1981, he produced the film Sorting Out Sorting ‚Äì a seminal piece elucidating the potential of computer animation and behavior that propelled the field of algorithm animation. In addition to the film, Dr. Baecker and his colleagues presented a systematic and comprehensive new approach to enhancing the presentation of computer program source using graphic design principles (1982‚Äì88), formulated conceptual frameworks for software visualization (1981‚Äì92), and constructed powerful yet unobtrusive systems for the visualization of programs in particular programming languages, and then applied it to the LOGO system(1988‚Äì94).Ron Baecker. September 2018. \\"Curriculum Vitae\\". From the 1990s through the 2010s, he created two innovative collaborative multimedia technologies. His team was the first group to employ hierarchically structured multimedia for the interactive authoring of digital video and other dynamic visual presentations, and the first to apply such a system to the creation of materials for software support and training. Additionally, his team worked on the use of highly interactive webcasting with structured rich media archives as the ePresence Interactive Media environment for collaborative learning.Ron Baecker. September 2018. \\"Curriculum Vitae\\". Furthermore, Dr. Baecker founded TAGlab to research the design of technologies for aging gracefully and was a founding researcher in AGE-WELL, Canada's Technology and Aging research network. This research is primarily focused on increasing computer literacy among seniors and using technology to help individuals work better and be safer. His current research has been centered on envisioning, designing, building, and evaluating technological aids intended for individuals with Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, amnesia, vision loss, and stroke, and the natural consequences of aging. Systems built include the development of online social gaming environments for seniors, online brain fitness environments, mobile phone software to help individuals with communication challenges to speak, e-book software to help people with visual or motor impairments to read, digital communicating picture frame technology to help connect individuals who are isolated and lonely to family and friends, and a thanatosensitive design of web portals to support individuals who are grieving.Ron Baecker. September 2018. \\"Curriculum Vitae\\". Early life Dr. Baecker was born in Kenosha, Wisconsin on October 7, 1942. When he was four, his family moved to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. His scientific career got off to an early start, when, in April 1958, he was awarded third prize in the American Chemical Society Chemistry test (Pittsburgh Section). He went on to win several other science honors while at Taylor Allderdice High School, including attending the Westinghouse Science Honors Institute (October 1958 to April 1959), and the Sun-Telegraph, Pittsburgh and Allegheny Count High Schools Scholastic Award in Science (1959). In 1960, he began work as a summer research assistant at Koppers Company Research Labs. He was awarded a B.S. degree in Physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1963 and received an M.S. degree in the then burgeoning field of Electrical Engineering, again from MIT in 1964. At the end of 1964, he traveled to the University of Heidelberg in Germany to further his studies in applied mathematics where he stayed until July 1965. He returned to his alma mater to study Computer Science at MIT's Department of Electrical Engineering and received his Ph.D. in June 1969.Ron Baecker. 18 Nov. 2015. \\"Ph.D., Computer Science, Department of Electrical Engineering, M.I.T 1969\\". University of Toronto, Toronto. Professional career = Entrepreneurial and Management Experience = Dr. Baecker has started five software companies, three of which he led as founding CEO. His first start-up, Human Computing Resources, later renamed to HCR Corporation, was founded in 1976 with an investment of $11,000 and eventually became a multi-million dollar world-class UNIX systems software firm. In 1990, it was sold the Santa Cruz Operation (SCO) and continued as SCO Canada until early 1996. His second venture, Expresto Software Corporation attempted to commercialize video authoring and publishing technology; in 2002, it was sold to a shareholder. Following the dissolution of Expresto, Dr. Baecker originated the concept and led the development for a successful proposal for an NSERC Research Network Grant entitled the Network for Effective Collaboration Through Advanced Research (NECTAR). Between 1995 and 1998, Dr. Baecker founded the Knowledge Media Design Institute at the Faculty of Information at the University of Toronto. This was the first institute at U of T to address interdisciplinary issues within the production, creation, and distribution of knowledge media. In 2002, KMDI sponsored the development of a knowledge media design collaborative graduate degree program. He continues to serve as the Institute's Chief Scientist to provide intellectual leadership. Between 2008 through 2011, he spun out Captual Technologies Inc. to develop and market ePresence, the first official open source software release from the University of Toronto, worldwide. In 2011, the company was sold to Canadian courseware management solutions firm Desire2Learn. Following his project to develop context-aware mobile communications apps to aid speaking by adults with communication disorders such as caused by strokes, or children with learning and communication challenges such as autism spectrum disorder, Dr. Baecker assisted the start-up of MyVoice Inc. to commercialize an extraordinary context-aware mobile speech aid app. The company was doing well, until it was abandoned by its CEO in 2016. Since 2010, Dr. Baecker has been transforming his work on aids for socially isolated and lonely seniors to keep them connected to family and friends into Famili.net Communications, which is currently commercializing a novel tablet-based communications tool for older adults. = Teaching Experience = Dr. Baecker is an active lecturer, and consultant on human-computer interaction and user interface design, user support, software visualization, multimedia, computer-supported cooperative work and learning, the Internet, entrepreneurship and strategic planning in the software industry, and the role of information technology in business. Since 1972, Dr. Baecker has developed original courses in interactive computer graphics, human-computer interaction, user interface and computational media and knowledge media design, computer-supported cooperative work, computer literacy, and software entrepreneurship. In 1973, he co-founded the Dynamic Graphics Project at the University of Toronto, creating the first Canadian university group studying HCI and computer graphics. In addition, in 1990, he developed the first undergraduate human-computer interaction specialization within computer science at U of T. Additionally, in 2004, he founded the TAGlab to support research and development of technologies to aid cognition, communication, and social interaction among seniors. Collaborators include individuals from Baycrest, Columbia Medical School, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, and Toronto Rehabilitation Institute. = Publications and Patents = Dr. Baecker has published over 200 papers and articles on HCI, UI design, software visualization, computer-supported cooperative work, and related topics.

It is manufactured by Merck KGaA under the tradename Emflex, and is available in the UK and other countries as a prescription-only drug.: Acemetacin.  Medical uses  Acemetacin has proven effective in the treatment of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and other kinds of rheumatoid inflammation, as well as in post- operative and post-traumatic pain and attack of gout. Application of a single dose of acemetacin for post-operative pain is not well supported by studies.  Contraindications  Contraindications are basically the same as with other NSAIDs: hypersensitivity reactions to NSAIDs in the past (typically asthma or skin reactions), gastrointestinal or cerebral bleeding, peptic ulcer, haematopoietic disorders (anaemia, leukopenia), and during the third trimester of pregnancy. on Emflex.  Adverse effects  Common side effects (in about 1‚Äì10% of patients) include gastrointestinal problems typical of NSAIDs, such as nausea, diarrhoea, stomach pain, and peptic ulcer; central nervous effects like headache and dizziness; and skin reactions. Gastrointestinal tolerability is better than that of the related drug indometacin. Severe allergic reactions and haematopoietic disorders occur in fewer than 0.01% of patients.  Interactions  The following interactions, typical of NSAIDs, have been described: * other NSAIDs, corticosteroids: increased frequency of side effects, especially peptic ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding * diuretics, ACE inhibitors and other antihypertensive drugs: reduced effectiveness of these drugs * with ACE inhibitors or ciclosporin, increased risk of kidney function disorders * anticoagulants such as warfarin: increased risk of bleeding * increased blood plasma concentrations of digoxin and methotrexate * decreased plasma concentrations of lithium  Pharmacology  Acemetacin acts as an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase (COX), producing the anti-inflammatory and analgetic (pain relieving) effects. In the body, it is partly metabolized to indometacin, which also acts as a COX inhibitor. The same mechanism is responsible for the antipyretic and antiplatelet effects, which are however not clinically used, as well as for the typical NSAID adverse effects. An advantage of acemetacin is that it reduces gastric damage as compared to indometacin, possibly because acemetacin has less effect on the increase of leukotriene B4 synthesis and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) expression, leading to less induction of leukocyte-endothelial adherence. = Pharmacokinetics = Metabolism of acemetacin. Cleaving of the glycolic acid ester (green) activates the substance to indometacin, cleaving of the methoxy ether or the 4-chlorobenzoate (orange) inactivate it. The substance is quickly and almost completely absorbed from the gut. Highest blood plasma concentrations are reached after two hours. It is bound to plasma proteins to 80‚Äì90%. Concentrations in the synovial fluid and membranes, muscle and bone are higher than in the blood. Apart from the active metabolite indometacin, a number of inactive metabolites are found after application of acemetacin: the O-desmethyl-, des-4-chlorobenzoyl-, and O-desmethyl-des-4-chlorobenzoyl derivatives of both indometacin and acemetacin, as well as all of these substances' glucuronides (mediated at least partly by the enzyme UGT2B7). Elimination half-life is 4.5¬±2.8 hours (in some individuals up to 16 hours) under steady state conditions. 40% are eliminated via the kidney, and 50% via the faeces.  Chemistry  Acemetacin is the glycolic acid ester of indometacin. It is a fine, slightly yellowish, crystalline powder that melts at . It is polymorphic, with four known anhydrous (water-free) and two monohydrate crystalline forms.

The Altendorf tomb () was an important megalithic tomb at Altenburg near Naumburg, northern Hesse, Germany. It was a gallery grave belonging to the Late Neolithic Wartberg culture. The Altenburg tomb is of special significance in Central European prehistory because of the large number of individuals it contained. Dates The tomb belongs to the Hessian-Westphalian stone cist group ('Hessisch-Westf√§lische Steinkistengruppe'), which is part of the Wartberg culture. It dates to the 3,400 BC or later and is normally assumed to be one of the earliest such monuments in the region.Raetzel-Fabian 2000, 116‚Äì117 Discovery and excavation The tomb was discovered accidentally, probably through agricultural activity, at some point in the early 20th century. Several small unprofessional attempts at digging appear to have been made until 1926. There are reports of the discovery of several sandstone blocks, and of numerous preserved skeletons, but the significance of the site was not realised at that point. About 4 m of the monument had been destroyed before systematic excavation, directed W. Jordan, took place in 1934.Jordan 1954, 5 Generally, the contents of the tomb turned out to be remarkably well preserved. The tomb was removed in its entirety after the excavation, but some finds and the entrance stone are on display at Wolfhagen (see below).Jockenh√∂vel 1990, 451 Tomb architecture The tomb, oriented east- south-east to west-north-west was built into a rectangular pit of 17 x 3 m dimensions, with an entrance ramp at the east end. The slabs that formed the tomb walls were placed in shallow foundation trenches along the edges of the pit bottom. The sandstone slabs used were up to 1.8 m long and 0.45 m wide. Their height is unclear as the tops of all surviving slabs had been broken off through agricultural activity, but they were preserved to a height of up to 0.9 m. All slabs leaned inwards slightly, but is not clear whether this was intentional. Although only 9 stones survived, there must originally have been about 33 (15 on each side, 1 at the west end and 2 at the east entrance). They formed a chamber of 17 x 2.9 m size. The entrance was at the E end. Here, The side walls protruded about 1.2 m beyond the limit of the chamber, forming an antae-like feature enclosing a small antechamber.Jordan 1954, 6‚Äì9 The main chamber was delimited by two slabs set between the side walls, roughly semi- circular openings cut into those slabs formed a mildly ovoid hole of 35 cm diameter, similar to the so-called Seelenl√∂cher (German for \\"soul holes\\") in the tombs at Z√ºschen,I Kappel 1990: Das Steinkammergrab bei Z√ºschen: Denkmal europ√§ischer Bedeutung in Nordhessen, F√ºhrungsblatt zu der Grabst√§tte der Jungsteinzeit in der Gemarkung Lohne, Stadt Fritzlar, Schwalm-Eder-Kreis, Arch√§ologische Denkm√§ler in Hessen 22, Wiesbaden, p. 3 LohraO. Uenze 1954: Das Steinkammergrab von Lohra, Kr. Marburg, Kurhessische Bodenaltert√ºmer 3, (Marburg: Elwert), 27‚Äì48, p. 28 and Bad Vilbel.K.

It is not clear how the chamber was roofed. A single slab found inside may have belonged to a stone roof, but the presence of a dense packing of limestone, basalt and quartzite slabs, as well as much charcoal, above the tomb deposits may represent the remains of a collapsed wooden roof, perhaps covered by an artificial mound or tumulus.Jordan 1954, 9‚Äì10 It is also unclear how the tomb was entered. The burial deposits contained in it reached nearly to the height of the top of the preserved wall slabs, making entry (especially carrying a body) through the hole in the east unlikely. Tomb interior The anteroom contained a bovine shoulder blade, lying on its earthen floor. The tomb chamber proper also had a simple earthen floor, but here and there it had been covered with limestone slabs. Such pavings occurred especially near the back and underneath groups of burials. Occasionally, slabs set on edge delimited small areas, one such partition contained 5 skulls of children. The dead had been placed in the tomb over time, possibly over several centuries. There were up to 4 burial layers, separated by layers of soil, stones, charcoal and rotten wood, perhaps the remains of intermediate coverings or floors. More recent depositions often damaged, moved or truncated earlier ones. There were fully articulated skeletons, fragmentary ones, piles of skulls (near the walls) and caches of other sorted bones, indicating some reorganisation of the remains after decay of their flesh had taken place. It appears that at that point, bones were often sorted according to type. Skulls were frequently stacked as piles or pyramids. 30 skulls were sitting in a row along the left wall. Intriguingly, of 8 articulated skeletons, only 2 retained the skull. As far as determinable, all bodies were placed parallel to the tomb, with their head towards the east.Jordan 1954, 11‚Äì16 (for whole section on interior) Some of the skeletons were associated with gravegoods. For example, an elderly man was accompanied by 5 fox jawbones, an arrowhead, a fossilised seashell, and several pierced dog teeth. A woman of over 40 years' age was found with a fox jaw, 20 pierced dog teeth and some cremated children's bones. The presence of burnt human remains is unusual in Wartberg culture tombs, with the exception of the tomb at Lohra.O. Uenze 1954: Das Steinkammergrab von Lohra, Kr. Marburg, Kurhessische Bodenaltert√ºmer 3, (Marburg: Elwert), 27‚Äì48, p. 37 Anthropological analysis The bones indicated a minimum of 235-250 individuals. In an early attempt at detailed anthropological study, their age and sex profiles were determined. The age profile is as follows: Age 0‚Äì7: 23 individuals; age 7‚Äì14: 20 individuals; age 18‚Äì22: 10 individuals; age 22 to 50: 169 individuals; over fifty: 13 individuals. The sex of 115 skeletons could be determined; 75 of them were male, 40 female.Jordan 1954, 12 The average height of the males was circa 1.6 m. The skulls are reported to have had \\"bad teeth\\". Some of the bones indicated healed injuries. It is not clear whether the bones represent the whole population of a settlement, or a selection. In either case, they must represent several generations.Jordan 1954, 16 Finds A stone axe from the tomb chamber (Regional Museum Wolfhagen). =Pottery= Pottery was numerous, but mostly fragmented. It is not clear whether it was broken before deposition, or perhaps as a result of being moved during the tombs' multiple reorganisations. No relationships between pottery vessels and individual skeletons were noted. The pottery included at least 2 collared bottles (a typical Wartberg culture find), a large globular vessel with lugs, some cups with decoration of applied cords, some shallow bowls, and a handled cup.Jordan 1954, 16‚Äì19 =Stone tools= There was a copious amount of stone tools, including a trapezoidal axe of Hessian slate, 17 triangular arrowheads of flint and slate, 16 flint and 7 slate blades, 2 flint scrapers, 1 chalcedony core, plus another 40 pieces of worked stone (mainly flint). At least some of the flint appears to be imported.Jordan 1954, 20 =Worked bone= Bone tools included an antler hook and a knife made from a boar's tusk, 5 bone chisels (up to 18 cm long), 5 awls and a tool made of a hollow bird bone.Jordan 1954, 21‚Äì22 =Mammal teeth and mandibles= Other bone or antler material probably served a decorative (jewellery) or totemic purpose. Among these are an antler bead and 119 pierced animal teeth, one from a calf, all the others of dog. These were often found together in groups, suggesting necklaces. Mammal mandibles (jawbones) were remarkably common, numbering 66. Most of them (47) were of fox, 5 were dog, 7 wild cat, 2 domestic cat, 2 polecat, 1 hedgehog and 1 piglet. The domestic cat specimens may be misidentified, since the arrival of that species in Central Europe is normally assumed to have occurred about 3,000 years later. Only one jaw was clearly worked, but some appear polished. Most jaws still contain canines, thus they are not the main source of the pierced canines found in such numbers. The presence of so many mandibles is striking, but not clearly understood. They were also numerous at several other Wartberg culture tombs.Jordan 1954, 22‚Äì23 =Other finds= There were also 2 clay spindle whorls, bits of deer antler, 3 amber beads (amber must have been imported to the region, probably from the Baltic, a pierced pebble, 2 pierced fossil shells, and a spiral roll of copper, associated with a child's skull.Jordan 1954, 21 =Unworked animal bones= Unworked animal bone came from a large array of species, including deer, cattle, wild boar, dog, fox, cat, hare, polecat, and weasel. None of these were numerous, and at least some may be the result of accidental or natural deposition during or after the use of the tomb. Two whole dog skeletons may have been deposited deliberately as burials.Jordan 1954, 23‚Äì24 Exhibitions The entrance stones, the animal mandibles and copies of a variety of other finds are on display in the Wolfhagen Country Museum (Regionalmuseum Wolfhager Land) in Wolfhagen. The remaining finds are in the State Museum of Kassel.

Plot Marriage Royale's story revolves around the male protagonist, a high school student named Tsukasa Hinomoto, who is told one day by his parents that he was adopted. Furthermore, they tell him that his real father is a manager of a large company, meaning he is very rich and holds a lot of power. Tsukasa's real father wants his son to marry a good woman, so he sets up an event known as Marriage Royale where beautiful girls from all over Japan will come together at a school built especially for the event and vie to become Tsukasa's fianc√©e. The school is located on an isolated island near Japan, and Tsukasa himself is taken there to live in a mansion in the care of two twin maids: Miku, the elder sister, and Miu, the younger sister.

Media =Books and publications= Marriage Royale began as a reader-participation game in the January 2006 issue of ASCII Media Works' Dengeki G's Magazine, where the profiles of two girls, Minato Daiba and Minami Umeda, were supplied for the reader. After reading the profiles, the reader could illustrate what they wanted the girls to look like, and send it in; out of all the entries, two were chosen for each girl, and the attributes of both were combined to create a single character design illustrated by either Aoi Nishimata, or Hiro Suzuhira. Both illustrators are from Navel, which is also known for producing the visual novels Shuffle!, and Soul Link. Every three months, two new profiles were published, and this pattern continued until the fourth round with eight girls at the time. The second round introduced Komachi Akita, and Otoha Shinjo; the third round brought in Miyako Asakura, and Yamuko Hidaka; and the fourth round had Sera Saeki, and Asahi Sanjo. In the September 2007 issue, four more profiles were published, with the same rules applying as with the previous rounds; the fifth round covered Ena Tenry≈´, Iyo Uwajima, Ebino Hamay≈´, and Uruma Nago. Aoi Nishimata has provided illustrations for Miku, Minami, Komachi, Yakumo, Sera, Iyo, and Ebino; Hiro Suzuhira drew Miu, Minato, Otoha, Miyako, Asahi, Ena, and Uruma. The short stories themselves, written by Shingo Hifumi, are more or less vignettes where each one gives a very brief glimpse of a scene between the protagonist, and the given heroine he is with in the story. The stories are accompanied by illustrations of the given heroine, and are drawn by either Aoi Nishimata, or Hiro Suzuhira depending on which artist originally drew which girl. The first batch of stories, serialized between the May 2006 and March 2007 issues, was under the collective title Girl's Heart, and contained eight chapters, one for each of the first eight heroines. A second batch under the general title Dearest Stories was serialized between the October 2007 and October 2008 issues and contained 13 chapters. The project ended in the May 2011 issue. Two light novels titled Marriage Royale written by Shingo Hifumi were published by ASCII Media Works under their Dengeki Bunko imprint between March 10 and September 10, 2010. =Manga= The Marriage Royale manga, illustrated by Koko Natsuki of Lime, was serialized between the April 2007 and January 2011 issues of Dengeki G's Magazine, published by ASCII Media Works.

The sonata was published a year later and revised in 1887. The work was Grieg's only piano sonata and it was dedicated to the Danish composer Niels Gade. The sonata has four movements with the following tempo markings: # Allegro moderato # Andante molto # Alla Menuetto, ma poco pi√π lento # Finale: Molto allegro A typical performance lasts around 20 minutes. In the first movement Grieg used a technique probably most famously used by Bach and Shostakovich: his own name, more precisely his initials E-H-G (H being the German name for note B), begins the melody in the first two bars, which is reiterated in octaves and even echoed by the left hand in bars 14 and 15.

In a 1944 letter to Ella Grainger, Percy Grainger mentioned planning to orchestrate the sonata. He apparently did so, but only a sketch is extant. However, an orchestration of the Menuetto by Danish composer Robert Henriques exists. Recordings In 1903 Grieg recorded two movements of his sonata. The first complete recording was that made on 20 April 1921 by the Australian pianist Una Bourne (1882‚Äì1974).The ShellackophileNaxos Later pianists to record the Sonata in E minor include Glenn Gould, Alicia de Larrocha and Eva Knardahl. Leslie Howard has recorded it on a disc of Four Scandinavian Piano Sonatas.

Very little is known about his life. Aulus Gellius mentions him as one of his contemporaries, and describes him as a \\"grave and holy man.\\"Aulus Gellius, Attic Nights, ix. 5. 8. Work Hierocles is famous for a book called Elements of Ethics (), part of which was discovered as a papyrus fragment at Hermopolis in 1901. This 300 line fragment discusses self-perception, and argues that all birds, reptiles, and mammals from the moment of birth perceive themselves continuously and that self-perception is both the primary and the most basic faculty of animals.A.A. Long, Stoic Studies. Chapter 11. Cambridge University Press. (1996). The argument draws heavily on a Stoic concept known as self-ownership or oikei√¥sis () which was based on the view that all animals behave in a self-preserving way and are not just aware of themselves, but are aware of themselves in relation of other animals. Hierocles's argument about self-perception was part of the groundwork for an entire theory of ethics. Some other fragments of Hierocles' writings are preserved by Stobaeus. The most famous fragmentStobaeus, Florilegium, 4.671 ff. describes Stoic cosmopolitanism through the use of concentric circles. Hierocles describes individuals as consisting of a series of circles: the first circle is the human mind, next comes the immediate family, followed by the extended family, and then the local community. Next comes the community of neighbouring towns, followed by your country, and finally the entire human race. Our task, according to Hierocles was to draw the circles in towards the centre, transferring people to the inner circles, making all human beings part of our concern.

Bucillamine is currently being investigated for COVID-19 drug repurposing. Bucillamine has a well-known safety profile and is prescribed in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in Japan and South Korea for over 30 years. It is a cysteine derivative with 2 thiol groups that is 16-fold more potent than acetylcysteine (NAC) as a thiol donor in vivo, giving it vastly superior function in restoring glutathione and therefore greater potential to prevent acute lung injury during influenza infection. Bucillamine has also been shown to prevent oxidative and reperfusion injury in heart and liver tissues. Bucillamine has both proven safety and proven mechanism of action similar to that of NAC, but with much higher potency, mitigating the previous obstacles to using thiols therapeutically. It is hypothesized that similar processes related to reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in acute lung injury during nCov-19 infection, possibly justifying the investigation of bucillamine as an intervention for COVID-19. On July 31st, 2020, the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Revive Therapeutics Ltd. to proceed with a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled confirmatory Phase 3 clinical trial protocol to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Bucillamine in patients with mild-moderate COVID-19.

Rosen, April 24, 1964 New York City), Award winning screenwriter and Top 5 Billboard USA & Top 10 Music Week UK singer/rapper/writer/producer who records under the name DaDa NaDa; Broadway credits as Robert Rosen; nickname OZN, (pronounced \\"OH-zen\\") is also a film producer and Broadway actor, and was the vocal half of 1980s synthpop duo EBN- OZN of MTV fame, widely credited as the creators of the first-ever commercially charted record produced on a computer. After a long absence from the music industry, Dada Nada saw major chart comebacks in the US & UK between 2016-2019. As a screenwriter he is best known for his work as co-producer and co-writer with Colin Greene of the award-winning, human rights-themed feature film I Witness starring Jeff Daniels, James Spader and Portia de Rossi. He is also a prominent American bisexual activist. Biography =Early life and career= As a child, he was a member of the New York City Metropolitan Opera Children's Chorus, appearing in numerous productions in both the \\"Old Met\\" and the \\"New Met\\" at Lincoln Center. At the age of 16, he was the youngest student to receive a Key Scholarship award from Herbert Berghof acting school (HB Studio) in Greenwich Village.Playbill Issue \\"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum starring Zero Mostel At 17, he was accepted as a voice and theater major at the Indiana University School of Music, where he studied with Norwegian Bass/Baritone Roy Samuelson of the New York City Opera. As a teenager, he went on the road as a singer with Doc Severinsen and The Tonight Show Band, working with Lew Tabackin, Ed Shaughnessy, Snookie Young, Tommy Newsom, Ross Tompkins, Buddy Rich and Mel Torm√©. His first professional musical theatre role was that of Hero in a tour of A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum with Zero Mostel. Shortly after, he created the role of Henry Anderson in the original Broadway cast of the Tony Award-winning musical ShenandoahibDb) starring John Cullum, which originally premiered at the Goodspeed Opera House. Subsequent acting work: leads in Vagabond Stars a pre- Broadway piece at the Berkshire Theater Festival with lyrics written by the Newsroom's Executive Producer/Director Alan Poul, Pirates of Penzance with Karla DeVito, and the LA company of Sam Shepard's Curse of the Starving Class with Gary Sinise and James Gammon. However, it was not until his supporting lead in a small National Endowment for the Arts film No Regrets directed by Ruth Charny and produced by Ellen Sherman and his subsequent lead in the Broadway rock musical MarloweibDb along with Patrick Jude and Lisa Mordente that he came to the attention of the New York music industry, in particular Ron Delsner, who encouraged him to begin his own recording career. =EBN-OZN and DaDa NaDa= In 1981, Rosen met Ned Liben, then the owner of New York's Sundragon Recording Studios. Liben had built his first professional studio at the age of 14 and by the time he met Rosen had worked with Jimi Hendrix, The Talking Heads, The Ramones and a host of New York's rockers. Their initial collaboration, \\"AEIOU Sometimes Y\\" was recorded in 1981‚Äì1982 (released in 1983) and was the first American record to be entirely produced on a computer (a Fairlight CMI). \\"AEIOU\\" was a mix of rap, spoken word, digital sampling, rock and R&B; dance music. Liben and Rosen cut their own 12-inch dance single, which was signed by Arista Records in London and in New York by Elektra Records' President Bob Kraznow before the band even had a name,MTV/USA Interview with Martha Quinn, 1983 which eventually became Ebn-Ozn. \\"AEIOU\\" went top 20 on the Billboard Club Chart, establishing OZN as one of the first white rappers in the industry. \\"AEIOU\\"'s video, a Los Angeles Times Top 10 Video of the Year, received domestic and international exposure and was featured on Beavis and Butt-head through the '90s. Ebn-Ozn's first full-length album, Feeling Cavalier, released by Elektra in 1984, went Top 20 on the College Radio Chart and their second single, \\"Bag Lady (I Wonder)\\" went Top 40 on the Billboard Club Chart. The video for \\"Bag Lady\\" starred Tony and Emmy Award winner Imogene Coca and like \\"AEIOU,\\" enjoyed worldwide television and club play. EBN/OZN received rave reviews for their album, singles, videos, live shows and versatile musicianship. EBN played guitar, bass, keyboards and programmed. OZN, sang, rapped, played keyboards and performed in spoken word \\"character voices,\\" in a variety of accents. They were covered in Time magazine,Time, Issue Date 1984, August People,People, Issue Date 1984, August USUS, Issue Date 1984, August and The New York Post.The New York Post, Sept. 23, 1983 Ozn was declared the \\"greatest white rapper alive\\" by PlayboyPlayboy, Issue Date 1984, August and called the \\"new American sex symbol\\" by the Boston Globe.The Boston Globe, July 15, 1984 EBN was also featured in Guitar Player magazine.Guitar Player, Issue Date 1984, September After the duo's split up in 1985, EBN went on to run his exclusive SOHO studio working with Scritti Politti and Arif Mardin, while OZN moved to Los Angeles and started his own label, One Voice Records and his own solo act, Dada Nada. Dada Nada received a distribution deal with Polydor/UK and he distributed it himself in North America, landing two top five Billboard dance hits, \\"Haunted House\\" (the first House record by a white artist to chart in North America) and \\"Deep Love\\". His 1991 UK release \\"The Good Thing/Give It All I Got\\", written & produced by OZN, Steve Wight and Bob Greenberg and mixed by Bad Boy Bill OZN & Steve Wight, was a two-song, 12-inch single, which as an import, hit No. 3 on the Record Mirror Cool Cuts Chart and No. 25 on the Record Mirror Mainstream Dance Chart. OZN's collaborators on Dada Nada tracks included the legendary Godfather of House the late Frankie Knuckles and House music pioneers Bad Boy Bill, David Morales, Mike \\"Hitman\\" Wilson, Steve Wight (now an associate professor of recording arts at Cal State), and Bob Greenberg. OZN's last public appearance was the 1990 US Dada Nada tour, which suffered a shooting incident during a show in Chicago. EBN died in 1998 of a heart attack in Soho, New York and is survived by his wife Sallie Moore Liben and son Max Liben. In April 2015, OZN announced on FacebookFacebook page of Robert Ozn April 27, 2016 and Twitter that he was making his first record in 25 years inspired by the Charlie Hebdo assassinations, Je Suis Paris!. An anthem for the growing, global pro-peace, anti-terror movement, he produced and wrote the track with Gabe Lopez, who works with Belinda Carlisle, supported by Julian Coryell, son of jazz legend Larry Coryell and guitarist for (Alanis Morissette), Chris Golden bass player for hip hop star Exzibit, Gibi Dos Santos Sergio Mendes' long-time Brazilian percussionist, and background vocalists Mindy Jones of Moby and Mark Strom of the boy band Innovate. Released in summer 2016 with remixes by Richard Cutmore, House of Virus and American, 19 year-old newcomer Mntna, the record's U.K. release peaked at #13 on the Music Week Commercial Pop Dance Chart in October 2016, after OZN recorded additional vocals with the lyric \\"I Am Orlando\\" in reference to the Orlando, Florida Pulse nightclub anti-gay terror attack, establishing it as an LGBT anthem through the United Kingdom, where it received widespread play on Gaydio.com, the largest internet radio station in the United Kingdom. And in the July 16, 2016 edition of Music Week (U.K.) journalist Victoria Dowling called him a \\"white Pharrell Williams.\\" Music Week 16 July 2016 \\\\- all of which thrust OZN back into the spotlight. In an interview with Scottish journalist Scott McGlynn he said, \\"This was supposed to be a personal outlet for expressing my outrage by singing a song that protested the murder of innocent people - and somewhere along the line it morphed into a hit record. But there's no record label - I released it myself. There are no significant resources supporting it nor is there any industry political leverage behind it. Hell, I've been out of that world for 25 years. And now people want interviews, photos - they want my time and to pull me away from my place behind the camera and push me in front of it again - in front of a microphone again. This is totally unexpected. How is this even possible?\\" ScottMcGlyn.net July 2016 In the 16 July 2016 edition of Music Week OZN was quoted, \\"I no longer care about things that used to be important to me when I was young: fame, extravagant materialism, self-aggrandizement...all that matters to me is my spiritual life, my family, love, my creativity, reframing my narrative, friends and the end of suffering for all beings.\\" Music Week 16 July 2016 His followup track, the 2017 record \\"We Can Feel It\\" had 1.2 Million listens on SoundCloud.com; reached Number 9 on the Music Week Commercial Pop Dance Chart in December 2017, Number 15 on the Billboard Dance Club Songs chart in February 2018, and in spring 2019 hit #44 on the US Alternative Radio \\"Sub Modern\\" Chart his first American release since 1990. Again, OZN proved to be a darling of the music press garnering rave reviews for his singing, song writing and production from WeRaveYou.com, iHouseYou.com, BroadwayWorld.com, VentsMagazine and Gigslutz.co.UK and others. =Film industry career highlights= OZN went on to a producing and screenwriting career in the film business. He worked first for free for Oliver Stone and Janet Yang's Ixtlan Films, trading his time in exchange for learning the development and production end of the movie business. He went on to become a paid first-call reader for A-list material for Stone. He was then hired at Miramax, as reader for Pulp Fiction under Oscar-winning producer Richard Gladstein and as contract development exec for much of their European fare and some of horror division Dimension Films' material. He also served as script analyst at Creative Arts Agency (CAA) on projects for Sydney Pollack, Louis Malle, Paula Weinstein and James Cameron's Lightstorm Entertainment. OZN partnered with Ted Danson as executive producers to option Elegies for Angels Punks and Raging Queens, playwright Bill Russell's West End London AIDS drama, for Anasazi/Paramount Television. Danson and OZN attached Michael Douglas, Richard Gere, Patrick Stewart, Whoopi Goldberg, Jason Priestley and Elizabeth Taylor as well as Danson. However, it remains un-produced; OZN and writer/producer Colin Greene (now a Vice-President at Sony Studios) sold Storm Warning, a $100 million-plus film, to Paramount for producer Mario Kassar, making the front page of the Daily Variety.Daily Variety, January 26, 1996 OZN and Greene's I Witness, (originally titled \\"God's Witness\\") (Universal/Promark) starring Jeff Daniels, James Spader and Portia de Rossi, received the 2003 Method Fest Best Screenplay Award.

The World Record Club Ltd. was the name of a company in the United Kingdom which issued long-playing records and reel-to-reel tapes, mainly of classical music and jazz, through a membership mail-order system during the 1950s and 1960s. In addition to titles imported from recording companies like Everest Records and Westminster Records, which it obtained on franchise, it made a series of recordings of international artists using its own engineers. Although often of great musical interest and very acceptable technical quality, these recordings do not appear in shop catalogues of the time as they were not available new through record shops. The label was taken over by EMI in 1965 but continued to be used as a sub-label for mail order, covering a wide range of musical genres, and distributing in South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.  Early days, c. 1955-1965  The earliest card covers were interchangeable with stick-on titles. World Record issues were certainly in production by mid-1956. The World Record Treasures records were promotedI.e. Promotional blurb to this effect was printed upon the reverse side of the universal or interchangeable card record sleeves produced and published by World Record Treasures, because that space, being universally interchangeable, was not used for sleevenotes relating to the recording content. This citation is therefore to the sleeve itself as a publication of this company. as a series from which 'members' (membership was free) were required to select a given number of purchases per year. These were sold at lower prices than usual (21s 6d, equivalent to ¬£1.07) and distributed in cheap wrappers (originally logo-printed Fablothene, and then card covers with stickers naming the selection). A monthly Club magazine (Record Review) was launched in late 1956, featuring the existing artists and recordings and announcing future selections.Record Review, Monthly magazine of the World Records Club, 1956-?. The company was first based at 125 Edgware Road, London, with a display centre at 49 Edgware Road.The address is published on the early sleeves, which may be dated with reference to the issue dates of the recordings they represent, as shown in Record review magazine. The main UK rival in similar business was the Concert Hall label. Membership was encouraged by such methods as using sleeve designs contributed by membersE.g. the sleeve of T23 identifies the artwork as being produced by a named contributor. and as these improved they obtained photographic services of Erich Auerbach. By 1958 there was a membership of at least 150,000. In the Promenade Concerts season of July to September 1958, World Records had a full- page advertisement (offering monthly releases at between 22s 6d and 24s 9d per disc, only one needing to be chosen per year) on the inside front cover of all the individual concert programmes, facing the actual music listing for the evening - a competitive space, placing it on equal footing with Electric Audio Reproducers, EMI Records, Decca Records, Grundig Tape Recorders, Ferguson Radiograms.Royal Albert Hall Promenade Concerts Season Programme July‚ÄìSeptember 1958. A full-priced record then cost around 40 shillings (¬£2). Key artists at the start were conductors Hans Swarowsky and Muir Mathieson, often with the Sinfonia of London, or Viennese orchestras. The development of new recordings was a special interest, under the celebrated recording engineer Anthony C. Griffith (1915‚Äì2005), who became recording manager for WRC in 1958.See Obituary, Anthony C. Griffith. The Brahms violin concerto (Endre Wolf, violin, Sir Anthony Collins, conductor, WRC TP30) was a 1958 landmark for them, as technical details were published on the sleeve, recorded both in stereo and mono using Ampex equipment and Neumann microphones.Sleevenote, World Record Club recording TP30 (Brahms Violin Concerto: Endre Wolf (violin), Anthony Collins (conductor)) Griffith made recordings of Colin Davis, Leon Goossens, Arthur Bliss, Reginald Jacques, Imogen Holst, the Melos Ensemble and Aeolian Quartet.See Obituary: Anthony C. Griffith, The Gramophone, at this link . WRC had the distinction of producing Colin Davis' first recording, conducting the Sinfonia of London in performances of Mozart's Symphonies 29 and 39 (TZ 130).TZ 130 cover notes The Mozart oboe concerto (Leon Goossens, oboe; Colin Davis, conductor, T59), issued c.1961, was a big technical and artistic success, the sleeve featuring photographs of studio sessions and playbacks.Sleevenote and graphics, World Record Club recording T59 (Mozart oboe concerto: Leon Goossens (oboe), Colin Davis (conductor)). The Label also produced a strong hand in English music, especially in Vaughan Williams' 9th Symphony and Greensleeves and Thomas Tallis Fantasias, and in music by Elgar, conducted by Adrian Boult and George Weldon, and in works of Sir Arthur Bliss. Important solo records of Sviatoslav Richter, Jorge Bolet and Shura Cherkassky were produced, and classical singers were not neglected. By 1958 the company's business address had changed to Parkbridge House, Little Green, Richmond, Surrey, where it remained thereafter. The 'Treasures' terminology was soon dropped, so that the title 'World Record Club' became the main label feature, written on ribbons wrapped about a globe. The WRC catalogue numbers were prefixed by the letter T (and sometimes ST to denote a stereo version, using the same number, and also TP), and ran from 1 to about 50 by 1962, to 500 by 1966 (and continued) to well over T1000. These were in red or green labels, with silver overprinting, and there was a later form in which the label edge was printed with many short radial lines so that the correct speed could be obtained by stroboscopic 'standstill' effect.See examples of World Record Club published labels with stroboscopic effect lines. There was also an OH series, with purple labels, for the WRC Opera Highlights series, often taken from interesting recordings or specially-made abridgements, and again presented in a uniform sleeve.See World Record Club 'Opera Highlights' (OH) series publications. From 1960 various recordings of musicals were made, and also three Gilbert and Sullivan operas, recorded for copyright reasons in Hamburg in 1961 ahead of the ending of copyright in the works. By this time the World Record Club was also releasing pre-recorded spool tapes of their LPs. These were mainly produced in mono half-track at 3¬æ ips. The quality of the tapes was very high and the price reasonable. They appealed to enthusiasts who had tape recorders for making their own recordings, because at that time broadcast sound quality (for off-air recordings) was not very high. These tapes were released with the prefix TT. Although in mono, they are half-track, which gives a very high and gratifying signal to noise ratio. A number of 7¬Ω ips half track stereo tapes were also released under the WRC label, in plain white boxes with a historical sculpture in orange on the front. At least 8 were produced, one of which is of Scheherezade with Eugene Goossens. =Recorded Music Circle= The Recorded Music Circle label carried best quality classical issues. About the start of 1959, a series devoted mainly to chamber music was created, under a new logo with an eagle in a circle, with 'R.M.C.' above it and 'World Record Club. Recorded Music Circle' beneath. The labels were attractively printed in light blue, showing a classical scene of two musicians wearing togas beside a stone column or altar, with the text details overprinted in red. The sleevenotes of the RMC were also printed in red, and after some experiments with a more ornamental sleeve, a uniform style of red lettering on a background of simulated wood-grain became the uniform sleeve design.See World Record Club 'Recorded Music Circle' (RMC) series publications, with dated sleevenotes in some cases. Once again the series mixed in-house and franchised recordings.Franchised recordings were identified by statements on the labels, e.g. 'A Westminster Recording', etc. See World Record Club 'Recorded Music Circle' (RMC) series publications. It included 'strong' material such as Ralph Kirkpatrick playing the Mozart K570 sonata (CM30); Rudolf Schwarz conducting Mahler's 5th Symphony (LSO - CM 39-40, Everest); Pierre Monteux conducting Berlioz's Romeo and Juliet (CM 57-58, Westminster); Robert Gerle (violin) and Robert Zeller with the Frederick Delius and Samuel Barber violin concerti (CM 59, Westminster), Hermann Scherchen's Mahler 7th Symphony (CM 63-64, Westminster), the Bruckner 8th of Hans Knappertsbusch (CM 71-72, Westminster), and the Richard Strauss memorial album with Clemens Krauss and Kurt List (CM 73-74, Amadeo).These examples are cited direct from World Record Club publications under the Catalogue numbers mentioned in the text above. This small but very interesting series had not reached 100 records by 1966. The pressings and presentation of this series was always good, usually with sleeve-notes by Malcolm Rayment, Stephen Dodgson or Peter GammondThese contributors are named in examples of WRC/RMC records cited direct as World Record Club publications. (now author of numerous musical books). One very famous recording that was released on WRC before any other label was the Finzi Dies natalis with Wilfred Brown.  EMI take control, 1965  From about 1965, when World Record Club was bought by EMI, the label lost its characteristic green or red design and acquired a completely new look, minimalist, with blocks of grey. An important early enterprise under the new management was the complete cycle of Beethoven piano concerti with Emil Gilels (piano) and George Szell (conductor). Anthony C. Griffith remained with the company under the new ownership, and, since there were fewer new recording projects, he and Gadsby Toni began to explore and transfer to LP parts of the historical archives of EMI, producing some of the finest transfers ever achieved. In 1971 he joined the EMI International Classical Division to work on Karajan recordings, but also expanded his work on historical transfers.cf. Obituary, The Gramophone. =Retrospect series= It was during the mid to late 1970s that the Retrospect series came to prominence under the WRC label. These records were dedicated to re-issues of material mostly from 78rpm records, mainly old Columbia and His Master's Voice material from the 1920s to 1940s. There were several major projects, including the reissue of the early Thomas Beecham Delius Society recordings, and welcome returns such as the Albert Sammons/Henry Wood Elgar concerto recording of 1929, or the Gerhard H√ºsch lieder recordings. However, the series was wide-ranging and included a large amount of show music and dance music of the 1920s and 1930s. The record labels were a distinctive pale green with a lettered ribbon surround, and the prefix was SH. The technical quality of these transfers reflected a desire to preserve the tonal qualities of the originals even if it meant keeping a certain amount of surface noise (though at HMV, Len Petts and others were assiduous in finding masters and producing vinyl pressings for dubbing). The advent of digital recording in the 1980s, and the wane of the 1970s Art Deco revival, turned attention away from the Retrospect series, the sleeves of which were deliberately given some 'Deco' styling. At this time, for instance in the transfers of Alfred Cortot's Chopin (e.g. SH 326, 327), the original WRC recording manager Anthony Griffith was still bringing his expertise to the high-quality transfers. He retired in 1979, but continued to act as consultant, notably for the CD transfers of the Elgar Edition.Obituary, The Gramophone.  Australian World Record Club  The World Record Club had a special franchise in Australia, and operated from 1957 to 1976. The registered office was in Hartwell, a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, with the postal address being P.O. Box 76, Burwood. Stores were provided in central Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth, where records could be auditioned and picked up. Subsidiary clubs under its control in the early years were the Light Music Club and the Record Society, but both were later absorbed into the WRC itself. Each year a selection of LPs would be made available, and subscribers needed to order them in advance. A catalogue listed the proposed records with descriptions, initially one per month but soon increasing to four and by 1970 to eight or more, for the forthcoming six months or year. Supplementary catalogues also appeared, listing additional releases to widen the repertoire. One of these was the Connoisseur Series, which made available classic performances from the past. Others were The Basic Library series and All-time Best Sellers (which enabled new members to fill gaps in their collections), The Living Bible narrated by Sir Laurence Olivier, and 24 Great Plays of Shakespeare. Subscribers would send in their order forms and, as the records became available, they would be mailed out or could be picked up at the metropolitan outlets. Most of the selections were from the catalogues of companies in the EMI or Decca groups. Whereas some were re-issues, for example the Decca Der Ring des Nibelungen 19-LP set, many were issued in Australia exclusively by the WRC. The Club also recorded local artists, bands and orchestras, particularly in light music or shows such as \\"The Maid of the Mountains\\". One of their more unusual releases was \\"15 Australian Christmas Carols\\" by William G. James. For this they used the Sydney Symphony Orchestra and the New South Wales State Conservatorium Choir, conducted by Sir Bernard Heinze. In 1963, WRC records sold for 35 shillings (Aus$3.50) or 37 shillings and sixpence (Aus$3.75) if posted. Equivalent discs in commercial record stores sold for 57 shillings and sixpence ($5.75). By 1970 the price per disc had actually fallen slightly to $3.39, plus 30 cents packing and postage. These prices were made possible by the policy of pre-ordering - the Club had only sufficient records pressed to cover the orders received, and so there was no overstock nor wastage. They were produced at the manufacturing plant of EMI (Australia) Ltd. in Sydney, although some esoteric discs were pressed elsewhere. An LP of sitar music was released in 1968 that was made in India. Some 7-inch discs for children were also produced. Subscribers were encouraged to order multiple records per month, with bonus Dividend LPs being offered at a rate of one per three monthly pre-selections. Though the Dividend LPs were offered at a bargain price of only 15 shillings each (Aus$1.50), their quality was equivalent to that of the regular issues. Members who introduced a new subscriber to the Club were rewarded with a free record, which they could select from a list of a dozen. In the first five years the record labels were a plain aqua colour, with the WRC logo and text in black. Around the circumference was a stroboscopic pattern to assist in checking turntable speed. Later records had a mid blue-green label, with an 18th-century image of a military trumpeter or fanfare-player in livery, as a background design to the overprinted label text. The album covers were often striking - innovative, colourful and modern, although some were criticised as being too drab. The WRC set up its own artistic studio at its offices at 330 Flinders Lane, Melbourne, and the sleeves are still regarded as a high point in Australian graphic design of the 1960s. They occasionally won awards, although some subscribers preferred more traditional record covers, and made their opinions known in the 'Viewpoint' page of the Club magazine. Many of the texts were written by James Murdoch. In the early years, multi-disc opera sets were lavish productions, the records in each set being presented in a red leatherette case with a folded silk ribbon opening tab. The discs in their plastic sleeves were separated by heavy sheets of gold card, bound into the box. A full libretto of nearly A4 size was included. A golden metal medallion was set into the middle of the front cover of the case, adding a touch of luxury and quality. By 1970, the Club was making its musical offerings also available as tapes, either on reels or as 8-track cartridges. Subscribers ordering reels needed to specify the tape speed required - 3 inches per second or 7 inches per second. To promote the sale of cartridges, the Club ran a promotion whereby a member could purchase five 8-track cartridges of their choice plus a car stereo cartridge player for $98.50. The Club at that stage was also selling mini hi- fi systems which ranged in price from $355 to $608. These were assembled for them in Australia by Bang and Olufsen, a Danish company. The quality components used included Labcraft turntables, B&O; pick-up arms, B&O; amplifiers and Beovox speakers. Each month subscribers received a copy of the World Record News, a slim magazine which provided interesting articles on music, its history, composers, artists and records. It also contained additional information about the next month's releases, supplementary catalogues with order forms, and special promotions. Readers' technical queries about music reproduction were dealt with by Eric Cleburne in a regular column, \\"Sound Advice\\". Any possible perceptions that the cheap prices of the records meant a lower overall quality were dealt with in another regular column, \\"Don't quote us - quote the critics!\\" in which reviews of WRC releases from independent sources were reprinted. The Editor-in-Chief of the magazine was a New Zealander, Harvey Blanks, who was responsible for most of the content. This was always of a very high standard, erudite, informative, enthusiastic and reliable. He wrote many articles on music and composers which appeared regularly in the Club magazine as a feature \\"The Golden Road\\" from mid-1963. These were later incorporated into his book \\"The Golden Road - a Record Collector's Guide to Music Appreciation\\" (Rigby, 1968). Mr Blanks, Chief Executive Officer John Day and Director of Repertoire Alex Berry were responsible for which records were selected for release, and many Australians owe their enduring love of classical music to the astute recommendations of these three gentlemen. The selections were particularly perspicacious - many are still regarded nearly fifty years later as first-choice performances. A large number have been re-released on CD by the parent companies. Recordings of outstanding technical quality, as from the catalogue of Everest, were also released, if their artistic merit justified their inclusion in the programme.  New Zealand World Record Club  The WRC operated in New Zealand between 1960 and the mid 1970s and provided a valuable service to music lovers in provincial towns, which lacked the record shops and selections available to collectors in the main centres. The Club took full-page advertisements in the New Zealand Listener magazine offering a choice of any three LPs for ten shillings to new members. Members received a magazine listing the upcoming monthly releases for that year, which had to be ordered in advance. The magazine featured a classical music column \\"The Golden Road\\" by World Record Club editor-in-chief Harvey Blanks. This was published in book form in 1968 by Rigby in Australia and Angus and Robertson in the UK and was offered for sale through the magazine. Five years in the making, it remains a highly readable and informative handbook for classical music devotees. The WRC had showrooms in Wellington (in Farish Street), in Christchurch (in Cashel Street) and Auckland (in Albert Street), with sound booths where it was possible to listen to LPs from the club's catalogue. LPs were pressed at a factory in Lower Hutt.

On 25 February 1213, he witnessed a confirmation of the properties of Arbroath Abbey as Roberto Capellano domini regis, \\"Robert Chaplain of the lord king\\".Barrow (ed.), Acts of William I, no. 513, at p. 465. King William had had another chaplain called Robert who became Archdeacon of Glasgow 1195 √ó 1196, but although neither used surnames, it is certain that they were not the same men.Barrow (ed.), Acts of William I, p. 32; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 171. It would probably be possible to know more about Robert if he had used a surname, but as it happens his details are lost in those large number of Norman and Anglo-Norman incomers in William's reign using that name.See, for instance, Barrow (ed.), Acts of William I, p. 527. After reporting the death of the previous Bishop of Ross, Reinald Macer, the Chronicle of Melrose related that: > {  electus est magister Andreas de Mureuia, qui renuens episcopari, > quesita licencia a dompno papa, tante dignitatis honorem humiliter > resignavit; loco cujus subrogatur Robertus capellanus domini W[illelmi] > regis Scottorum.  master Andreas de Mureuia was elected: but refusing to > be bishop, he sought permission from the lord pope, and humbly resigned the > honour of so great a dignity. Robert, the chaplain of the lord William, king > of the Scots, was put in his place. Stevenson (ed.), Chronica de Mailros, > pp. 113-4, trs. Anderson, Early Sources, vol. ii, p. 394. } Andreas de Moravia's refusal to accept his own election had led thus to the elevation of the king's chaplain. This election occurred before the death of King William on 4 December 1214.Dowden, Bishops, p. 211; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 266. Robert's name occurred as \\"bishop-elect\\" on 17 February 1215, but he is a consecrated bishop by 7 July, meaning he had received consecration between these respective dates.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 266. Robert appeared on various documents during the reign of King Alexander II of Scotland; he appeared on 30 March 1226, again on 1 February 1227, and on 30 June 1228.Dowden, Bishops, p. 211. Pope Gregory IX issued, on 29 May 1235, Robert the authority to increase the number of cathedral prebends, augment existing prebends and expand his cathedral.Anderson, vol. ii, p. 394, n. 3; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 266. This mandate was repeated, in an expanded form, in 1256, for his successor. According to Professor Donald Watt, it may have been this bishop rather than Robert II whom Bower remembered as the builder of Ross cathedral. Robert Capellanus appears to have died in 1249.

Once the weather vane was erected over the town square, parents would tell the children that Old Thomas was watching how they behave and would leave candy under their pillow for good behavior. Immortalized in copper, Thomas continues to watch over Tallinn and its citizens. In 1944, Old Thomas was hit during the March bombardment.

He studied medicine and surgery at the University of Pavia, where he was a pupil of Camillo Golgi (1843‚Äì1926). After graduation in 1900, he became an assistant to Golgi at his pathological institute. In 1909 Negri became a professor of bacteriology, and the first official instructor of bacteriology in Pavia. On 19 February 1912 he died of tuberculosis at age 35. Negri performed extensive research in the fields of histology, hematology, cytology, protozoology and hygiene. In 1903 he discovered the eponymous Negri bodies, defined as cytoplasmatic inclusion bodies located in the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum in cases of rabies in animals and humans. He documented his findings in an article titled Contributo allo studio dell'eziologia della rabia, published in the journal Bollettino della Societa medico-chirurgica.Negri's bodies @ Who Named It At the time, Negri mistakenly described the pathological agent of rabies as a parasitic protozoa. A few months later, Paul Remlinger (1871‚Äì1964) at the Constantinople Imperial Bacteriology Institute correctly demonstrated that the aetiological agent of rabies was not a protozoan, but a filterable virus. Negri went on, however, to demonstrate in 1906 that the smallpox vaccine, then known as \\"vaccine virus\\", or \\"variola vaccinae\\", was also a filterable virus.A. Negri, 'Ueber Filtration des Vaccinevirus', Z. Hyg. InfektKrankh., 1906, 54: 327-346, see pp. 332-333. During the latter part of his career, he became interested in malaria and was at the forefront in efforts to eradicate it from Lombardy.

Dabore competed at three Olympics; Tokyo 1964, Mexico City 1968 and Munich 1972. He was the first Nigerien person to compete at the Olympics and the first Nigerien to win an Olympic medal. Dabore won his Olympic medal at the 1972 Munich Olympics, where he won a bronze medal in the men's light-welterweight. Competition =1964 Summer Olympics= At the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan, Dabore competed in the men's welterweight competition. By doing so, he became the first person from Niger to compete at an Olympics. Dabore was the only athlete from Niger who competed at the games. In his competition, Dabore was drawn against Hong Tshun Fu of Taiwan in the first round. Dabore won the fight due to a technical knockout. In the second round, in which sixteen athletes competed in, Dabore was drawn against and beat Hans-Erik Pedersen of Denmark. Dabore again won the fight due to a technical knockout. In the quarterfinals held on 19 October 1964, Dabore was drawn against Pertti Purhonen who had defeated Australian Frank Roberts and Czechoslovak Bohumil Nƒõmeƒçek to reach the quarterfinal stage. Purhonen won the fight 3‚Äì2 and, therefore, Dabore was eliminated. The competition was eventually won by Marian Kasprzyk of Poland. =1965 All-Africa Games= At the 1965 All-Africa Games in Brazzaville, Dabore participated in the welterweight competition. He won the silver medal, losing in the final to Joseph Bessala of Cameroon. =1968 Summer Olympics= At the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, Mexico, Dabore competed in the men's light-welterweight competition. He was one of two Nigeriens who competed at the games, with fellow male boxer Dary Dasuda the other. In the second round of his competition (he had a bye in the first), Dabore was drawn against Jos√© Mar√≠n of Costa Rica. Dabore won the fight 5‚Äì0 and he therefore progressed to the third round.

As the Koch brothers' primary political advocacy group, it is one of the most influential American conservative organizations. After the 2009 inauguration of President Barack Obama, AFP helped transform the Tea Party movement into a political force. It organized significant opposition to Obama administration initiatives such as global warming regulation, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the expansion of Medicaid and economic stimulus. It helped turn back cap and trade, the major environmental proposal of Obama's first term. AFP advocated for limits on the collective bargaining rights of public-sector trade unions and for right-to-work laws, and it opposed raising the federal minimum wage. AFP played an active role in the achievement of the Republican majority in the House of Representatives in 2010 and in the Senate in 2014. In the 2014 mid-term election cycle, AFP led all groups, other than political action committees (PACs), in spending on political television advertising. AFP's scope of operations has drawn comparisons to political parties. AFP, an educational social welfare organization, and the associated Americans for Prosperity Foundation, a public charity, are tax-exempt nonprofits. As a tax-exempt nonprofit, AFP is not legally required to disclose its donors to the general public. The extent of AFP's political activities while operating as a tax-exempt entity has raised concerns among some campaign finance watchdogs regarding the transparency of its funding.  Background, founding, and growth  Americans for Prosperity was founded in 2004 when internal rivalries caused a split in the conservative political advocacy group Citizens for a Sound Economy (CSE), creating Americans for Prosperity and FreedomWorks. AFP's founding was funded by businessmen and philanthropist brothers David H. Koch and Charles Koch, of Koch Industries. The Americans for Prosperity Foundation is the Koch brothers' primary political advocacy group. According to a spokesperson from Koch Industries, the Koch companies do not direct the activities of AFP. AFP's original stated mission was \\"educating citizens about economic policy and mobilizing citizens as advocates in the public policy process\\". Its current stated mission is \\"to mobilize citizens to advocate for policies that cut red tape and increase opportunity, put the brakes on government overspending, and get the economy working for hard workers‚Äì not special interests\\". It is focused on \\"fiscal responsibility,\\" and in particular on cutting taxes, reducing regulation of business, and limiting the power of the courts.Meyer, D. S., and A. Pullum. \\"The Tea Party and the Dilemmas of Conservative Populism,\\" in Understanding the Tea Party Movement, edited by D. S. Meyer and N. Van Dyke. (London: Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2014), p. 89. According to FactCheck.org, \\"AFP seeks to support free markets and entrepreneurship by advocating lower taxes and limited government spending and regulation.\\" Its leaders view the organization as a counterbalance to the progressive movement's unions and activist organizations. According to NBC News, The New York Times and others, some of AFP's policy positions align with the business interests of the Koch brothers and Koch Industries, including its support for rescinding energy regulations and environmental restrictions; expanding domestic energy production; lowering taxes; and reducing government spending, especially Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. in Nella Van Dyke and David S Meyer, eds., * Describes AFP as one of several groups \\"established before Obama's election and funded by very wealthy sponsors who sought both to promote an ideological vision and to protect a financial interest. As Jane Mayer's profile of the billionaire Koch brothers (2010) notes, the promotion of a conservative ideology with hundred of millions of dollars serves business concerns worth many times that. Moreover, she notes, the Koch brothers had accepted the input of big government initiatives when they were helpful to the business.\\" From 2004 to 2007, AFP was led by Nancy Pfotenhauer. In 2005, the Kochs hired political strategist Tim Phillips to work at AFP. AFP had a staff of 116 employees in September 2012, and the next year it had chapters in 34 states and reported a membership of 2.3 million. In June 2014, it had 240 employees in 32 states. AFP has been active in national, state, and local elections. AFP registered to lobby in 2014. According to FactCheck.org, by 2011, AFP had \\"emerged as one of the most influential conservative issue advocacy groups on the national and state political scene\\". The Los Angeles Times said AFP performed roles typical of national and state political parties. ABC News said in August 2014 that AFP was \\"poised to be the most influential conservative group in the nation this year, and among the most influential and heaviest spending across the political spectrum this year and into the looming presidential race\\". As of mid-September 2018, AFP has become one of just 15 groups which account for three-quarters of the anonymous cash; following the 2010, Citizens United v. FEC decision by the U.S. Supreme Court, which paved the way paved the way for dark money to flow into U.S. elections.Dark Money Illuminated. Issue One  Leadership, structure and funding  Tim Phillips is president of both AFP and the AFP Foundation. AFP has been called both the political and educational arm of the AFP Foundation. AFP and the AFP Foundation share offices and staff. =AFP= As of 2014, New Jersey businesswoman Frayda Levin chaired the board of directors of AFP. Other directors include Pfotenhauer, former U.S. government official and economist James C. Miller III, James E. Stephenson, and Mark Holden. Filing with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as a 501(c)(4) nonprofit, tax-exempt, social welfare organization, contributions to AFP are not tax deducible. AFP is legally required to operate as non-partisan, it may not endorse or oppose political candidates, its primary purpose may not be political, it must be primarily engaged in social welfare activities, and no more than half of its expenditures may be political. =AFP Foundation= David H. Koch chaired the board of directors of the AFP Foundation. Other directors include Pfotenhauer, economist Walter E. Williams, Debra Humphreys, and Cy Nobles. The AFP Foundation is an associate member of the State Policy Network, a national network of free-market oriented think tanks. As a 501(c)(3) non-profit, tax- exempt charity, contributions to the AFP Foundation are tax deducible, and such charities are largely prohibited from political activity. = Transparency = Tax-exempt, nonprofit charitable organizations such as AFP are generally not required to disclose their contributors, in contrast with political action committees. Some campaign finance watchdogs and Democrats have criticized AFP for what they perceive to be its funding of political activities from undisclosed sources. For example, the Sunlight Foundation and others have accused non-disclosing political groups like AFP of filing for nonprofit status solely to invoke the right to hide their donors. President Obama, speaking at a Democratic National Committee fundraising dinner in August 2010, criticized AFP for its political spending and non-disclosure of donors. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee filed a complaint with the IRS charging that the AFP Foundation had funded political advertisements in violation of the law applicable to the foundation's tax-exempt classification. AFP responded that the charges were without merit. President of AFP Tim Phillips later suggested that the reason behind the Democrats' filing of the complaint was simply that they were scared of the impact the organization was having. In 2010 and 2011, AFP reported to the IRS that it was not involved in political activities. Questioned by a reporter before the 2012 Wisconsin recall elections, AFP's Wisconsin director said AFP was educating the public and not engaging in political activity. In 2014, an AFP spokesperson said AFP had the right to keep its donors private, citing NAACP v. Alabama, a 1958 Supreme Court ruling that protected National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) donors from potential harassment. In 2014, AFP president Phillips said that protecting donors' identities was prudent given the Obama administration's ideology-based IRS targeting of citizens. The AFP Foundation said its supporters have received serious threats. In February 2015, a federal judge granted the Foundation's motion for a preliminary injunction staying California Attorney General Kamala Harris's request for the names and addresses of Foundation donors, pending resolution of the legality of the request. = Funding = While AFP does not disclose its funding sources, some supporters have acknowledged their contributions and investigative journalism has documented others. AFP has been funded by the Kochs and others. At AFP's 2009 Defending the Dream summit, David Koch said he and his brother Charles provided the initial funding for AFP. In initial funding, David Koch was the top contributor to the founding of the AFP Foundation at $850,000. Several American companies also provided initial funding of the AFP Foundation, including $275,000 from State Farm Insurance and lesser amounts from 1-800 Contacts, medical products firm Johnson & Johnson, and carpet and flooring manufacturer Shaw Industries. Later grants from the Koch family foundations include $1 million in 2008 to AFP from the David H. Koch Charitable Foundation and $3 million between 2005 and 2007 to the AFP Foundation from the Claude R. Lambe Charitable Foundation, controlled by Charles Koch. Other grants from Koch-related funding sources include $32.3 million in 2012 and $1.5 million in 2013 from Freedom Partners and $4.2 million through 2011 to the AFP Foundation from the Center to Protect Patient Rights. Between 2003 and 2012, the AFP Foundation received $4.17 million from the John William Pope Foundation, chaired by AFP director Pope, the largest identifiable donor to the AFP Foundation. In 2011, the AFP Foundation received $3 million from the foundation of the family of billionaire Richard DeVos, the founder of Amway, making the DeVos family the second largest identifiable donor to the AFP Foundation. In 2010, AFP received half a million dollars from the Bradley Foundation. AFP received smaller grants in 2012 from tobacco company Reynolds American and in 2010 and 2012 from the American Petroleum Institute. The donor-advised fund Donors Trust granted $11 million to AFP between 2002 and 2010 and $7 million to the AFP Foundation in 2010. Tea Party and 2010 midterm election Sarah Palin at the Americans for Prosperity-run Wisconsin 2011 Tax Day Tea Party Rally on April 16, 2011. AFP helped transform the nascent Tea Party movement into a political force. AFP supported the Tea Party movement by obtaining permits and supplying speakers for rallies. AFP helped organize and publicize a \\"Porkulus\\"-themed protest on the state capitol steps in Denver, Colorado on February 17, 2009, in conjunction with Obama signing the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Within hours of CNBC on-air editor Rick Santelli's remarks on February 19, 2009, that criticized the Act and called for a \\"Chicago tea party,\\" AFP registered and launched the website \\"TaxDayTeaParty.com,\\" calling for protests against Obama. AFP had a lead role in organizing Taxpayer Tea Party rallies in Sacramento, Austin, and Madison in April 2009. AFP was one of the leading organizers of the September 2009 Taxpayer March on Washington, also known as the \\"9/12 Tea Party,\\" according to The Guardian. On April 16, 2011, former Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin was the keynote speaker at an AFP annual tax day tea party rally at the state capitol in Madison, Wisconsin. In the 2010 midterm elections, AFP played a major role in achieving a Republican majority in the U.S. House of Representatives. AFP supported tea party groups, purchased political advertisements, and sponsored a nationwide bus tour themed \\"November is Coming\\" to recruit organizers and canvassers. AFP helped Tea Party groups organize voter registration drives. An AFP website offered \\"Tea party Talking Points.\\" The organization provided Tea Party activists with education on policy, training in methods, and lists of politicians to target. In October 2010, AFP sponsored a workshop on the political use of the internet at a Tea Party convention in Virginia. AFP said it spent $40 million on rallies, phone banks, and canvassing during the 2010 election cycle. Of the six freshman Republican members of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce in 2010, five benefited from AFP advertisements and grassroots activity. David Weigel wrote in Slate that AFP \\"in the Tea Party era evolved into one of the most powerful conservative organizations in electoral politics.\\" AFP and the Tea Party share many of the same principles. In 2010, AFP was one of the most influential organizations in the Tea Party movement, and the largest in terms of membership and spending. According to Bloomberg News, with AFP the Koch brothers \\"harnessed the Tea Party's energy in service of their own policy goals, including deregulation and lower taxes....As the Tea Party movement grew in the aftermath of Obama's election, the Kochs positioned Americans for Prosperity as the Tea Party's staunchest ally\\".  Labor law  AFP advocates for a reduction in public sector union benefits and pensions, in conjunction with curtailments of public sector collective bargaining rights. AFP has opposed raising the minimum wage. = Wisconsin collective bargaining = AFP's activities in Wisconsin developed the state into the nation's foremost conservative-progressive battleground, and AFP used tactics in Wisconsin that were applied in later campaigns. AFP has been a major supporter of Republican Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker. In 2009 and 2010, AFP helped raise the statewide profile of Walker, then Milwaukee County county executive, by inviting him to address its rallies. In 2011, when Walker's agenda of reduced spending, cuts to union benefits, and limits on public-sector collective bargaining drew thousands in opposition to the streets around the state capitol in Madison, AFP bussed in hundreds to counter-protest. AFP spent $320,000 on television advertisements and sponsored a website and bus tour themed \\"Stand Against Spending, Stand With Walker\\", and spent a total of $7 million in support of Walker. AFP spent $3 million in opposition to the recall campaign against Walker in 2011‚Äì2012 and sent 75 trained canvasers to Wisconsin. After the passage of Walker's signature legislation, the 2011 Wisconsin Act 10, which limited collective bargaining rights for most public employees, AFP ran advertisements and held town-hall meetings with the theme \\"It's Working Wisconsin!\\" Days before the recall election, AFP sponsored a ten-city bus tour themed \\"A Better Wisconsin.\\" In the context of Walker's 2014 re-election campaign, AFP purchased television issue advertisements in support of Act 10. = Michigan right-to-work = Americans for Prosperity's Wisconsin campaign curtailing collective bargaining rights and turning back a recall demonstrated to AFP that similar efforts could succeed in Michigan. A top priority of AFP in Michigan was right-to-work legislation, which prohibited employers from deducting union dues from employee pay checks and prohibited labor contracts from excluding non-union members. AFP had opposed Michigan Governor Rick Snyder, a Republican, on a number of issues, including the Detroit River International Crossing Bridge project, an expansion of Medicaid funded by the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and a road bill which raised taxes. AFP coordinated support for right-to-work in Michigan. The AFP Foundation produced a 15-page booklet titled Unions: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly: How forced unionization has harmed workers and Michigan. AFP's website urged members to gather at the state capital in Lansing on December 6, 2012, and some three hundred protestors showed up. AFP bussed in activists and offered supporters $25 gas cards, free lunch, and drinks. AFP reserved space and erected a large heated tent near the Capitol steps for supporters. On the morning of December 6, during a lame duck session of the Republican-controlled Michigan legislature, Snyder called a joint press conference with the legislative leadership to announce fast-track right-to-work legislation. The legislation passed both houses of the Michigan legislature that day, as protesters and counterprotesters demonstrated outside. Michigan state police responded. AFP said protesters tore down the AFP tent. No arrests were made. On December 10, President Obama visited Daimler AG's Detroit Diesel factory in Redford, Michigan, and told employees the legislation was about the \\"right to work for less money.\\" Snyder signed the legislation on December 11. In 2014, Snyder ran for re-election and AFP posted an online advertisement praising his legislative record. Obama re-election AFP ran an early television advertising campaign opposing Obama's re-election. An August 2012 ProPublica analysis of broadcast television political advertising purchases by category showed that two nonprofit organizations, AFP and Crossroads GPS, combined, outspent all other categories, including political parties, political action committees, super PACs, unions, and trade associations. While previously AFP had run issue advertising that opposed Obama's programs, in August 2012 the organization shifted to express advocacy, which explicitly called for his defeat. That month, AFP spent $25 million on television commercials against Obama. AFP said the goal of the commercials was to educate voters. AFP raised $140 million in the 2012 election cycle, and it spent $122 million, more than in all the previous eight years since its founding. The organization spent more than $33.5 million on television advertisements opposing Obama's re- election. In 2011 and 2012, AFP spent $8.4 million in swing states on television advertisements denouncing a loan guarantee the Department of Energy had made to Solyndra, a manufacturer of solar panels. Solyndra was the first recipient of such a guarantee under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, and the company went bankrupt. In January 2012, The Wall Street Journal said AFP's Solyndra campaign was \\"perhaps the biggest attack on Mr. Obama so far in the 2012 election campaign.\\" AFP sent a bus on a nationwide tour condemning Obama's economic policies called the \\"Obama's Failing Agenda Tour.\\" In April 2011 in New Hampshire, AFP sponsored an informal gathering of five Republican presidential candidates, including Mitt Romney, Tim Pawlenty, Michele Bachmann, Rick Santorum, and Herman Cain. AFP offered tea party groups $2 for every new AFP member their volunteers signed up at polling places in the February 2012 Florida Republican primary. AFP employed methodologies developed in its efforts to thwart the recall of Wisconsin governor Scott Walker, including deploying a smartphone application called \\"Prosperity Knocks\\" to canvassers. AFP canvassers utilized \\"Themis,\\" an online voter database of millions of Americans. AFP president Phillips said that AFP's canvassing support application offered field operatives the previous voting history of voters integrated with Census data and consumer data including purchases, magazine subscriptions, and favorite websites. Programs and advocacy =Energy and environment= AFP supports oil and gas development and opposes regulation, including environmental restrictions. The AFP Foundation opposed President Obama's efforts to address global warming. AFP was important in creating the Tea Party movement and in encouraging the movement to focus on climate change. AFP helped defeat proposed U.S. legislation embracing cap and trade, a market-based approach to control pollution by providing economic incentives. In August 2009, Mother Jones magazine identified cap and trade as one of the key domestic policy goals of the Obama administration, and identified AFP as one of the most prominent groups in opposition. In 2008, AFP circulated the No Climate Tax Pledge to government officials at the federal, state, and local levels, a pledge to \\"oppose any legislation relating to climate change that includes a net increase in government revenue.\\" By July 2013, 411 lawmakers and candidates, including a quarter of U.S. Senators and more than a third of U.S. Representatives, primarily Republicans, had signed the pledge. Of the twelve Republicans on the House Energy and Commerce Committee in 2011, nine signed the pledge. AFP held more than eighty events in opposition to cap and trade, including the nationwide Hot Air Tour, which involved floating hot air balloons in protest of what AFP described as \\"global warming alarmism.\\" AFP raised a balloon in Phoenix, Arizona, in fall 2008Andrew Ross, Bird on Fire: Lessons From the World's Least Sustainable City (New York: Oxford University Press: 2011), p. 152) and also over Al Gore's house in Tennessee. AFP described cap and trade as \\"the largest excise tax in history.\\" AFP sponsored a Regulation Reality Tour to foment opposition to climate change legislation and federal regulation of carbon emissions. The tour involved fake \\"carbon cops\\" with badges in green Smart cars with flashing lights who wrote citations for \\"carbon crimes\\" like running a lawn mower. In 2011, AFP launched a Running on Empty website and national tour featuring a 14-foot inflatable gas pump intended to link rising gas prices to the Obama administration's environmental regulations and to promote offshore drilling for oil. Long lines formed in several states in 2012 when AFP offered drivers gas discounted to the price in effect when Obama took office. In 2012, AFP campaigned against Republican political candidates who acknowledged the science of climate change. AFP advocates for the construction of the proposed Keystone XL Pipeline. In February 2015, AFP organized supporters to telephone the White House urging Obama to sign legislation authorizing the project. AFP led an effort to repeal a federal tax credit for wind power. In Kansas, Ohio, North Carolina, and other states, AFP campaigned to overturn renewable portfolio standards, state laws that mandated a percentage of the state's electricity come from renewable resources. AFP announced plans to oppose Republican candidates who support a carbon tax in the 2016 presidential primaries. =Health care and 2014 midterm= AFP president Tim Phillips speaking at an AFP health care rally next to the United States Capitol in October 2009 AFP has described itself as the nation's largest grassroots champion for health care freedom. In August 2009, Mother Jones magazine identified health care reform as one of the key domestic policy goals of the Obama administration, and identified AFP as one of the most prominent groups in opposition. AFP sponsored two other groups advocating against the Obama administration's proposed health care reform, Patients United Now and Patients First. In May 2009, AFP launched Patients United Now, which opposed a single-payer health care system and a government- funded health insurance option. It purchased television advertisements warning of \\"government-controlled health care\\" or a \\"Washington takeover\\" of health care. In one Patients United Now television advertisement, a Canadian woman, Shona Holmes, said she could not get timely treatment in Canada and ultimately was treated in the U.S. Patients United Now staged more than three hundred rallies to oppose the Obama administration's proposed Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). In summer 2009, Patients First sponsored a six-week \\"Hands Off My Health Care\\" bus tour. Hands Off My Health Care events included rallies protesting against the health care plan and collected signatures in an effort to raise awareness about free-market-based health care reforms. After the ACA became law, AFP worked for its repeal and campaigned to block states from accepting federal funds made available under the law to expand Medicaid. State legislators who supported Medicaid expansion were targeted, including Republican Virginia state senators Emmett Hanger and John Watkins. AFP bussed in volunteers to a hearing in the state capital and to call constituents, distribute flyers, and send mailings. AFP campaigned against Medicaid expansion in Michigan, Louisiana, and Nebraska and helped defeat Medicaid expansion in Florida. AFP president Phillips said AFP advocated for repeal of the ACA to keep the issue \\"in front of the public\\" and to use the threat of a presidential veto to portray Obama as \\"unwilling to take some reasonable commonsense reforms.\\" Phillips told The New York Times that a broader goal of AFP's anti-ACA advertising spending was to present the ACA as a \\"social welfare boondoggle\\" which would foster opposition to spending on climate change. In March 2012, AFP, with support from the California-based Tea Party Express, organized a rally at the Capitol during the Supreme Court's oral arguments regarding the constitutionality of the ACA. AFP played a major role in the 2014 midterm elections, helping Republicans achieve a majority in the U.S. Senate. AFP targeted legislators who had supported the ACA four years earlier. AFP's first campaign advertisement aired in September 2013, and by January 2014 the organization had spent $20 million, by May, $35 million, and by July, $44 million, amounts unprecedented so early in a political campaign cycle. Senators targeted Kay Hagan, Mary Landrieu, Mark Begich, and Jeanne Shaheen, all Democrats. In early 2014, AFP ran nationwide advertisements featuring stories about people whose health care, according to the ads, had been compromised by the ACA, whom AFP termed \\"ObamaCare victims.\\" Between January 1, 2013, and August 31, 2014, in the campaign to control the Senate, AFP aired more than 27,000 television advertisements, about one in every 16 ads. AFP was one of the leading spenders on political advertising in 2014. AFP lead all non-political action committees in terms of spending on television air time for political advertisements in the 2014 election cycle through April. =Fiscal policy advocacy= AFP advocates limited government. Within two days of Obama's inauguration in February, 2009, Americans for Prosperity launched a television advertising campaign and a website \\"nostimulus.com\\" which featured an online \\"No Stimulus\\" petition addressed to U.S. Senators, notifying them that the vote on Obama's first major legislative initiative, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, would be included in AFP's congressional rankings and urging a \\"no\\" vote. The petition characterized the Act as \\"dramatically increasing federal debt and spending...under the pretense of stimulus or recovery.\\" Internet traffic overwhelmed the website, but it was unable to prevent passage in the legislature and a petition to repeal the act. In 2011, AFP opposed the extension of unemployment benefits, writing that unemployment benefits increase unemployment. In late 2012, AFP opposed a proposed federal relief bill after Hurricane Sandy, the second-costliest hurricane in United States history. AFP's New Jersey director questioned the federal government's role in natural disaster relief, saying it should be limited to the repair of federal buildings. AFP opposed smoking bans in Texas and Virginia. Michele Bachmann speaking at the \\"Cut the spending now\\" rally at the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C., on April 6, 2011 sponsored by Americans for Prosperity. \\"Government overspending is the greatest threat to economic prosperity,\\" according to AFP. In 2013, AFP launched a \\"Spending Accountability Project\\" which supported letting the $85 billion in automatic cuts to federal spending required by the budget sequestration take effect. AFP opposed the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, also known as the Ryan-Murray deal, which proposed $40 billion in spending in excess of the sequestration. AFP called the deal \\"not just bad policy, it is bad politics\\" and noted the loss of the \\"hard-won bipartisan spending limits set by the sequester.\\" AFP advocates for lower taxes. AFP opposed a 2006 cigarette tax hike in Indiana and helped fund the \\"No on 29\\" effort in opposition to California Proposition 29 (2012), which would have placed a $1 excise tax on tobacco products to fund smoking medical research and smoking cessation. In 2013 in Indiana AFP ran a television advertising campaign in support of Governor Mike Pence's ten percent state income tax cut. AFP advocates for the repeal of the estate tax, which they call the \\"death tax\\". AFP advocates for free market solutions. In 2011, AFP sent mailings and funded radio advertisements criticizing the proposed construction of a Detroit River International Crossing bridge, a publicly financed project that would compete with the nearby privately owned Ambassador Bridge linking Detroit, Michigan, with Windsor, Ontario; AFP charged that the project would be a waste of taxpayer money if toll revenues did not cover debt service. AFP advocated the dissolution of the Export-Import Bank of the United States. =Other policy advocacy= AFP opposes consideration of race and economic class in the assignment of students to schools. According to AFP's North Carolina state director, in 2009 AFP did voter education and supplied volunteers in school board-elections in Wake County, North Carolina. Wake County includes the state capital, Raleigh, and has the 18th largest school district in the US. AFP supported a slate of candidates that opposed desegregation busing, which AFP has called \\"forced busing.\\" AFP ran phone banks and canvassed in another school board election in Kenosha, Wisconsin, in 2014. AFP helped organize rallies in favor of virtual and charter schools. AFP is a member of the Internet Freedom Coalition, which opposes net neutrality. AFP's vice president for policy Phil Kerpen chaired the Coalition. AFP supported January 2014's federal appeals court ruling against the Federal Communications Commission's authority to enforce net neutrality. AFP urged Congress to legislatively pre-empt regulation of the internet. AFP sponsors the \\"Grassroots Leadership Academy\\", a training program designed to help build a conservative movement in respect to the rise of Trumpism. =Annual events= Political commentor Mark Levin at a Defending the American Dream event in 2007 In 2007, AFP began hosting a yearly Defending the American Dream Summit, now the second-largest annual gathering of conservatives in Washington, D.C. In conjunction with the July 2008 Netroots Nation conference in Austin, Texas, AFP hosted RightOnline, a conference of conservative bloggers and activists that aimed to develop conservative social media strategies, which become an annual event. Election-related activities In June 2011, AFP placed fake eviction notices on doors in the Delray neighborhood of Detroit, stating that homes might be taken to make way for the Detroit River International Crossing project. In August 2011, AFP mailed absentee voter applications to Democratic voters in at least two recall elections in Wisconsin that included a filing deadline two days after the election. The return envelopes were addressed to an \\"Absentee Ballot Application Processing Center\\" with the post office box number of Wisconsin Family Action, a socially conservative group, rather than to the clerk's office. Responding to charges of voter suppression, AFP said the incorrect date was a \\"printing mistake\\" and was intended only for voters in the two districts where Democrats are set to face recalls on a later date. The state board of elections opened an investigation. In 2013 in Virginia and 2014 in Arkansas, the AFP Foundation mailed \\"voter history report cards,\\" which included the public-record voting history of both the addressee and its neighbors. A 2014 television advertisement targeting Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Gary Peters of Michigan for his support of the Affordable Care Act featured leukemia patient Julie Boonstra, who said she could no longer afford the cost of her treatment after the ACA. The Washington Post reported that the advertisement had \\"significant factual errors and/or obvious contradictions.\\" Boonstra would save at least $1,000 a year under the ACA, according to The Detroit News. AFP aired another television advertisement in which Boonstra said Peters was trying to silence her. AFP apologized for another television advertisement that criticized the ACA and Democratic Senator Mark Udall, a candidate for reelection, using images of a somber Obama and Udall from their visit to Aurora, Colorado, in the wake of the mass shooting there. In April 2014, AFP mailed voters in at least eight West Virginia counties material that may have led them to believe they were ineligible to vote in an upcoming primary election. The mailings, received just before the deadline to update voter registration, included registration cards and prepaid return envelopes addressed to county clerks, with a message cautioning voters that if they did not update their voter registration, they might lose their right to vote in the upcoming primary election. AFP's West Virginia director said the mailings were a non-partisan, get out the vote effort targeting unregistered voters. In September 2014, AFP was investigated by the state board of elections of North Carolina after the state Democratic Party filed a complaint regarding an AFP voter registration mailing labelled \\"official application form\\" containing inaccurate information including an incorrect filing deadline five days before the actual deadline. AFP stated the mistakes in the North Carolina mailings were \\"administrative errors.\\" In 2017, AFP ran ads attacking Virginia Democratic candidate for governor Ralph Northam. In 2018, the New Hampshire attorney general's office began investigating the nonprofit status of AFP after a group of Republican representatives accused the conservative activist group of improperly wading into state elections. The investigation is ongoing. The organization may support Democrats in the 2020 United States elections as part of a broader effort to adjust its strategy.

History According to tradition, St. Trudpert's Abbey originated with Saint Trudpert, an Irish missionary and martyr in the southern Black Forest in the first half of the 7th century. He established a hermitage in M√ºnstertal which became a monastery in the 9th century, and which by, at the latest, 900 had expanded to a monastic community supported by the influential noble family of the Liutfride. It is recorded that relics of Trudpert were translated to the abbey in 901 and shortly after 965. The abbey's development during the next few centuries seems to have been peaceful: no involvement either in ecclesiastical reform or in the Investiture Controversy is recorded. The community's estates lay principally in the M√ºnstertal, the Breisgau, the Ortenau and in Alsace. It also acquired the lordship of Tunsel and the parishes of M√ºnstertal, Grunern, Krozingen, Tunsel, Laufen, Biengen and others. The abbey was also able to capitalise on the silver-mining industry that developed in the region in the later Middle Ages, on the basis of which the small town of M√ºnster grew up below the abbey. In 1346, together with the castle of Burg Scharfenstein, a property of the Staufer, it was destroyed by armed men from Freiburg, and shortly afterwards flooded, from which disasters it never recovered, and was abandoned. The monastery in turn suffered an economic decline in the latter half of the 14th century, apparently during the time of abbot Paul I (1435-1455). In 1525 St. Trudpert's was plundered during the German Peasants' War. In 1632 it was destroyed by the Swedes during the Thirty Years' War. Around 1200 the lords of Staufen (who were not relatives of the Hohenstaufen),:de:Staufen (Adelsgeschlecht) ministeriales of the dukes of Z√§hringen, acquired Vogtrechte (rights of advocacy or stewardship) over St. Trudpert's. The monastery reacted by the production of forged documents purporting to establish a higher Vogtei of the Counts, later Dukes, of Habsburg, with the consequence that until their extinction in 1601 the Staufer functioned as under-V√∂gte of the Habsburgs. The Habsburg over-Vogtei also meant that the abbey became part of the lordship of Vorder√∂sterreich and thus a Habsburg monastery. As such it was secularised in 1806 and became part of the Grand Duchy of Baden. Several medieval church and monastery buildings are evidenced, for example a rebuilding of the monastery in 902, and again (possibly after an attack by the Hungarians at the beginning of the 10th century) at some time before 962. Buildings The basilica, with three aisles, was extended by the addition of a westwork in about 1100; in the 15th century new monastic buildings were constructed, as well as a Gothic long choir (Langchor). After the destruction of the claustral buildings by the Swedes in 1632 there followed an interim rebuild, which made way for the Baroque new build between 1712 and 1716. The unparalleled stucco work on the high altar was created by Johann Joseph Christian when his son Karl Anton Christian (1731‚Äì1810) became abbot here.Germany: A Phaidon Cultural Guide. Oxford: Phaidon, 1985. p. 648. Two crosses in niello work from the 13th century have been preserved. From the monastery library comes a manuscript of the second half of the 14th century containing the \\"St. Trudperter Hohelied\\", the \\"first book of German mysticism\\", as it is sometimes known, a Lower Alemannic German text from the 12th century. Sisters of St. Joseph of St. Trudpert The Sisters of St. Joseph of St. Trudpert took over the premises in 1919-1920 after their expulsion from Alsace and have undertaken major construction work not only on the monastic buildings themselves but also on hospital and other medical building projects.

History  The strait is named after the first European to sail through it, British navigator William Dampier in 1700 in . Dampier described his discoveries in his A Continuation of a Voyage to New Holland Ch. 4 New Britain Discovered in these terms: > NEW BRITAIN. The easternmost part of New Guinea lies 40 miles to the > westward of this tract of land, and by hydrographers they are made joining > together: but here I found an opening and passage between, with many > islands; the largest of which lie on the north side of this passage or > strait. The channel is very good, between the islands and the land to the > eastward. ... As we stood over to the islands we looked out very well to the > north, but could see no land that way; by which I was well assured that we > were got through, and that this east land does not join to New Guinea; > therefore I named it New Britain. The north-west cape I called Cape > Gloucester, and the south-west point Cape Anne; and the north-west mountain, > which is very remarkable, I called Mount Gloucester. ... SIR GEORGE ROOK'S > ISLAND. Being near the island to the northward of the volcano I sent my boat > to sound, thinking to anchor here; but she returned and brought me word that > they had no ground, till they met with a reef of coral rocks about a mile > from the shore. Then I bore away to the north side of the island where we > found no anchoring neither. We saw several people, and some coconut-trees, > but could not send ashore for want of my pinnace which was out of order. In > the evening I stood off to sea to be at such a distance that I might not be > driven by any current upon the shoals of this island if it should prove > calm. We had but little wind, especially the beginning of the night; but in > the morning I found myself so far to the west of the island that, the wind > being at east-south-east, I could not fetch it; wherefore I kept on to the > southward and stemmed with the body of a high island about 11 or 12 leagues > long, lying to the southward of that which I before designed for. I named > this island Sir George Rook's Island. LONG ISLAND AND CROWN ISLAND, > DISCOVERED AND DESCRIBED. We also saw some other islands to the westward; > which may be better seen in my chart of these lands than here described. > But, seeing a very small island lying to the north-west of the long island > which was before us, and not far from it, I steered away for that; hoping to > find anchoring there: and, having but little wind, I sent my boat before to > sound; which, when we were about 2 miles distance from the shore, came on > board and brought me word that there was good anchoring in 30 or 40 fathom > water, a mile from the isle and within a reef of the rocks which lay in a > half-moon, reaching from the north part of the island to the south-east: so > at noon we got in and anchored in 36 fathom a mile from the isle. In the > afternoon I sent my boat ashore to the island to see what convenience there > was to haul our vessel ashore in order to be mended, and whether we could > catch any fish. My men in the boat rowed about the island, but could not > land by reason of the rocks and a great surge running in upon the shore. We > found variation here 8 degrees 25 minutes west. I designed to have stayed > among these islands till I had got my pinnace refitted; but, having no more > than one man who had skill to work upon her, I saw she would be a long time > in repairing (which was one great reason why I could not prosecute my > discoveries further) and, the easterly winds being set in, I found I should > scarce be able to hold my ground. The 31st in the forenoon we shot in > between 2 islands lying about 4 leagues asunder; with intention to pass > between them. The southernmost is a long island with a high hill at each > end; this I named Long island. The northernmost is a round high island > towering up with several heads or tops, something resembling a crown; this I > named Crown Isle from its form. Both these islands appeared very pleasant, > having spots of green savannahs mixed among the woodland: the trees appeared > very green and flourishing, and some of them looked white and full of > blossoms. We passed close by Crown Isle; saw many coconut-trees on the bays > and the sides of the hills; and one boat was coming off from the shore but > returned again. We saw no smokes on either of the islands, neither did we > see any plantations; and it is probable they are not very well peopled. We > saw many shoals near Crown Island, and reefs of rocks running off from the > points a mile or more into the sea. My boat was once overboard with design > to have sent her ashore; but, having little wind and seeing some shoals, I > hoisted her in again and stood off out of danger.

He was the commanding officer of D Company with the 2/2 infantry battalion of the 6th Division in the first Libyan and Greek campaigns. Military career In the Libyan campaign, Chilton was described as an exceptionally careful planner who liked to leave nothing to chance. In May 1941 Chilton was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO), which cited his \\"conspicuous gallantry, coolness and initiative\\". During the Greek campaign, New Zealand General Bernard Freyberg praised Chilton as a fine man and Freyberg also praised Chilton for his calm attitude during the campaign.Volume II ‚Äì Greece, Crete and Syria, Australia's Official Histories ‚Äì Second World War, Australian War Memorial, retrieved 2008-10-27. From 1943 to 1945, Sir Frederick, with the rank of brigadier, commanded the 18th Australian Infantry Brigade in Buna, the Ramu Valley and later in Borneo.

He is credited with helping crack a Russian spy ring attempting to operate in Australia. In 1948, he was appointed assistant secretary of the Defence of Department and two years later promoted to the position of chairman of the Repatriation Commission, the forerunner of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Chilton said that the time when he led the Repatriation Commission was \\"perhaps the most useful, productive and satisfying years of my working life, and they gave full scope to whatever leadership qualities I may have possessed\\".

He was remembered as the last surviving commanding officer of the 2/2nd Infantry Battalion of the 6th Division; he was farewelled in Sydney by a handful of his former colleagues. The handful of surviving soldiers from Sir Frederick's 2/2 Battalion, all in their late 80s, reflected on their experiences serving under a man they described as \\"inspirational and genuine\\".

Its flow is the second after the Caroni River among the affluents of the Orinoco River, with almost . The river is inhabited by both the Ye'kuana and Sanema indigenous groups. Basin The river drains the Guayanan Highlands moist forests ecoregion. The Caura River is about long. Its major tributary is the Erebato. Both rivers emerge from the Jaua-Sarisari√±ama Plateau, more than above sea level). The Caura is navigable up to Par√° Falls (Salto Par√°), an impressive waterfall formed by two branches of the river with an island in the middle Both branches have some rapids and join in one of the most remarkable waterfalls in the Orinoco basin, not because of its height, but because of the impressive flow of water. The Caura is a Blackwater river, like the Caron√≠, the Ventuari River and the upper Orinoco. The Caura is wide at Musinacio (Musi√∫ Ignacio Musi√∫ Ignacio was a pirate along the Orinoco Basin, having his hideaway on the Caura's mouth at the Orinoco), the point where it joins the Orinoco, wide at this point. Microclimate Satellite images in the Intertropical Zone show an interesting lack of clouds above the biggest rivers, such as the Caura and Orinoco, and also in the Amazon river. We need to take into account two facts: *Satellite images, like aerial ones, are taken in the morning, when there are less clouds in the atmosphere. *Sunshine heats up both water in rivers and land surface. However, water needs much more time to heating up than land does and atmosphere air is not heated by solar rays because it is diathermanous. It is heat coming up from soil and river waters, which in turn heat up the atmosphere. Therefore, difference of temperature between land and rivers is at its maximum at 10 a.m. (more or less). At that time, the land surface reflects heat to the atmosphere, making air ascend and condense, forming clouds, while water is still heating up and, thus, there is not outcoming heat to the atmosphere.

They are still widely used in applications such as computerized cash register systems, owing to the age of many registers. Green screen was the common name for a monochrome monitor using a green \\"P1\\" phosphor screen; the term is often misused to refer to any block mode display terminal, regardless of color, e.g., IBM 3279, 3290. Abundant in the early-to-mid-1980s, they succeeded Teletype terminals and preceded color CRTs and later LCDs as the predominant visual output device for computers.  Design  An open Schneider MM12 from 1988. It uses a GoldStar Type 310KGLA amber tube. Unlike color monitors, which display text and graphics in multiple colors through the use of alternating-intensity red, green, and blue phosphors, monochrome monitors have only one color of phosphor (mono means \\"one\\", and chrome means \\"color\\"). All text and graphics are displayed in that color. Some monitors have the ability to vary the brightness of individual pixels, thereby creating the illusion of depth and color, exactly like a black-and-white television. Typically, only a limited set of brightness levels was provided to save display memory which was very expensive in the '70s and '80s. Either normal/bright or normal/dim (1 bit) per character as in the VT100 or black/white per pixel in the Macintosh 128K or black, dark gray, light gray, white (2bit) per pixel like the NeXT MegaPixel Display. Monochrome monitors are commonly available in three colors: if the P1 phosphor is used, the screen is green monochrome. If the P3 phosphor is used, the screen is amber monochrome. If the P4 phosphor is used, the screen is white monochrome (known as \\"page white\\"); this is the same phosphor as used in early television sets. An amber screen was claimed to give improved ergonomics, specifically by reducing eye strain; this claim appears to have little scientific basis. However, the color amber is a softer light, and would be less disruptive to a user's circadian rhythm.  Usage  Well-known examples of early monochrome monitors are the VT100 from Digital Equipment Corporation, released in 1978, the Apple Monitor III in 1980, and the IBM 5151, which accompanied the IBM PC model 5150 upon its 1981 release. The 5151 was designed to work with the PC's Monochrome Display Adapter (MDA) text-only graphics card, but the third-party Hercules Graphics Card became a popular companion to the 5151 screen because of the Hercules' comparatively high-resolution bitmapped 720√ó348 pixel monochrome graphics capability, much used for business presentation graphics generated from spreadsheets like Lotus 1-2-3. This was much higher resolution than the alternative IBM Color Graphics Adapter 320√ó200 pixel, or 640√ó200 pixel graphic standard. It could also run most programs written for the CGA card's standard graphics modes. Monochrome monitors continued to be used, even after the introduction of higher resolution color IBM Enhanced Graphics Adapter and Video Graphics Array standards in the late 1980s, for dual-monitor applications.  Clarity  Pixel for pixel, the monochrome monitors produce sharper text and images than color CRT monitors. This is because a monochrome monitor is made up of a continuous coating of phosphor and the sharpness can be controlled by focusing the electron beam; whereas on a color monitor, each pixel is made up of three phosphor dots (one red, one blue, one green) separated by a mask. Monochrome monitors were used in almost all dumb terminals and are still widely used in text-based applications such as computerized cash registers and point of sale systems because of their superior sharpness and enhanced readability. Some green screen displays were furnished with a particularly full/intense phosphor coating, making the characters very clear and sharply defined (thus easy to read) but generating an afterglow-effect (sometimes called a \\"ghost image\\") when the text scrolled down the screen or when a screenful of information was quickly replaced with another as in word processing page up/down operations. Other green screens avoided the heavy afterglow-effects, but at the cost of much more pixelated character images. The 5151, amongst others, had brightness and contrast controls to allow the user to set their own compromise. The ghosting effects of the now-obsolete green screens have become an eye-catching visual shorthand for computer-generated text, frequently in \\"futuristic\\" settings. The opening titles of the first Ghost in the Shell film and the Matrix source code of the Matrix trilogy science fiction films prominently feature computer displays with ghosting green text. Green text is also featured in the Swan's computer in Lost series.  Phosphor limitations  Monochrome monitors are particularly susceptible to screen burn (hence the advent, and name, of the screensaver), because the phosphors used are of very high intensity. Another effect of the high-intensity phosphors is an effect known as \\"ghosting\\", wherein a dim afterglow of the screen's contents is briefly visible after the screen has been blanked. This has a certain place in pop culture, as evidenced in movies such as The Matrix. This ghosting effect is deliberate on some monitors, known as \\"long persistence\\" monitors. These use the relatively long decay period of the phosphor glow to reduce flickering and eye strain.

Placed in the command of Amiss who was made Acting Ensign, she was renamed Fern about 19 October.  Operating with the Mississippi Squadron  Fern was assigned to the Mississippi River Squadron to operate on western waters between Cairo, Illinois, and the mouth of the Red River. She towed barges loaded with troops, delivered dispatches, transported officers, and tended coal barges.  Transporting Major General William T.

Chapra CD Block registered 39.58 on the MHPI scale. The CD Block-wise mean MHVI was estimated at 33.92. A total of 8 out of the 17 CD Blocks in Nadia district were found to be severely deprived when measured against the CD Block mean MHVI - Karimpur I and Karimpur II (under Tehatta subdivision), Kaliganj, Nakashipara, Chapra, Krishnanagar I and Nabadwip (under Krishnanagar Sadar subdivision) and Santipur (under Ranaghat subdivision) appear to be backward. As per the Human Development Report 2004 for West Bengal, the rural poverty ratio in Nadia district was 28.35%. The estimate was based on Central Sample data of NSS 55th round 1999-2000. Economy =Livelihood= In Chapra CD Block in 2011, amongst the class of total workers, cultivators formed 27.29%, agricultural labourers 47.68%, household industry workers 2.83% and other workers 22.20%. The southern part of Nadia district starting from Krishnanagar I down to Chakdaha and Haringhata has some urban pockets specialising in either manufacturing or service related economic activity and has reflected a comparatively higher concentration of population but the urban population has generally stagnated. Nadia district still has a large chunk of people living in the rural areas. =Infrastructure= There are 77 inhabited villages in Chapra CD Block. 100% villages have power supply and drinking water supply. 23 Villages (29.87%) have post offices. 75 villages (97.40%) have telephones (including landlines, public call offices and mobile phones). 38 villages (49.35%) have a pucca approach road and 50 villages (64.94%) have transport communication (includes bus service, rail facility and navigable waterways). 13 villages (16.88%) have agricultural credit societies and 14 villages (18.18%) have banks. Although 100% villages in Nadia district had power supply in 2011, a survey in 2007-08 revealed that less than 50% of households had electricity connection. In rural areas of the country, the tube well was for many years considered to be the provider of safe drinking water, but with arsenic contamination of ground water claiming public attention it is no longer so. Piped water supply is still a distant dream. In 2007-08, the availability of piped drinking water in Nadia district was as low as 8.6%, well below the state average of around 20%. =Agriculture= Although the Bargadari Act of 1950 recognised the rights of bargadars to a higher share of crops from the land that they tilled, it was not implemented fully. Large tracts, beyond the prescribed limit of land ceiling, remained with the rich landlords. From 1977 onwards major land reforms took place in West Bengal. Land in excess of land ceiling was acquired and distributed amongst the peasants. Following land reforms land ownership pattern has undergone transformation. In 2013-14, persons engaged in agriculture in Chapra CD Block could be classified as follows: bargadars 6.28%, patta (document) holders 9.25%, small farmers (possessing land between 1 and 2 hectares) 7.87%, marginal farmers (possessing land up to 1 hectare) 28.62% and agricultural labourers 47.98%.As the proportion of agricultural labourers is very high, the real wage in the agricultural sector has been a matter of concern. Chapra CD Block had 355 fertiliser depots, 34 seed stores and 65 fair price shops in 2013-14. In 2013-14, Chapra CD Block produced 57,747 tonnes of Aman paddy, the main winter crop from 20,658 hectares, 44,098 tonnes of Boro paddy (spring crop) from 13,744 hectares, 13,212 tonnes of Aus paddy (summer crop) from 5,384 hectares, 2,205 tonnes of wheat from 871 hectares, 126,190 tonnes of jute from 7,489 hectares and 638 tonnes of potatoes from 25 hectares. It also produced pulses and oilseeds. In 2013-14, the total area irrigated in Chapra CD Block was 1,370 hectares, out of which 618 hectares were irrigated by river lift irrigation and 752 hectares by deep tube wells. =Banking= In 2013-14, Chapra CD Block had offices of 8 commercial banks and 4 gramin banks.

The story features themes of environmental degradation, conservation of nature and habitat, and extinction. It also features arithmetic, and at the back of the book there are instructions for several number games relating to the book. It also contains a game in the book where you have to find an amount of plants, animals, buildings and sometimes one snortelpig. All of the animals and plants featured in the book were invented by the author. Some of the animals included are the snortlepig, moopaloop, lumpybum, and frinklepod. The human voice of the story is that of the aptly named Uno, the first human to move into the forest.

These three ships were , Alaunia, and . The Alaunia was the second of these three ships. She and her sisters had only 2nd class and 3rd class. Alaunia was launched on 9 June 1913, and made her maiden voyage on 27 December 1913. When World War I began, she was requisitioned as a troopship. HMS Alaunia was the first Cunard ship to transport Canadian troops. She was sent in the Gallipoli campaign by the summer of 1915. Then she worked on carrying troops to Bombay later the same year. She returned to the North Atlantic and carried troops from Canada and America in 1916. During a voyage from London to New York, she struck a mine on 19 October 1916 in the English Channel off the Royal Sovereign Lightship of Hastings, East Sussex. laid earlier that day by Spindler, Handelskrieg, Vol III. pp.306-7. After attempts to beach the ship and tow her to shore with tugs, her captain realized the ship was lost and finally gave the order to abandon ship. Two crew members lost their lives in her sinking. Today, the wreck of the Alaunia lies on its port side in the English Channel in 15 metres (50 feet) of water.

His revolt was merely the longest and most severe of what was then endemic to Catalonia: private feudal warfare, which was theoretically restricted by the Peace and Truce of God, and disavowal of comital prerogatives by the castellans who nominally owed their positions to the count.Bisson, 24. Mir Geribert was related to both the counts and viscounts of Barcelona, being a son of viscount Geribert II and Ermengard, daughter of Count Borrel II. His powerbase lay in the Pened√®s, where he had many castles, chief among them Ol√®rdola.Bensch, 60. Despite his wide-ranging possessions in that region, he had been marginalised as a member of a cadet branch of the vicecomital dynasty and was unwilling to accept his second-tier position within the Pened√®s or his exclusion from the familial possessions in La Gu√†rdia and Barcelona.Bensch, 130. He refused to accept a wife of any other than the comital dynasty of the Bellonids and insisted on placing himself on equal footing with his relatives of the main vicecomital branch, which ambition led to violent confrontations. These conflicts were not, however, with his relatives, such as his cousin the viscount Udalard II or his uncle the bishop Guisalbert, but with the count, Raymond Berengar I, who refused to grant him a bride from his own family. Though both Udalard and Guisalbert got into a war with the count at this same moment, it was not related directly to Mir's rebellion. In 1039, Mir's brother, Folc Geribert, granted the castle of Ribes near Ol√®rdola to their uncle the bishop. Thus deprived of any control over an important frontier fortress, Mir negotiated for the return of the castle in 1041, when he received it back from the bishop in return from swearing homage.Kosto, 191. At some point in his battle with Raymond Berengar, Mir assumed the title princeps Olerdulae, which implied independent authority.Kagay, 40. Raymond Berengar countered by claiming princely authority in his marches. After Mir lost a claim against the monastery of Sant Cugat del Vall√®s, he openly defied the court and the Visigothic law.Freedman, 118 n8. In 1052 or 1053 a tribunal presided over by the seneschal Amat Eldric condemned Mir Geribert.Shideler, 16 n37. In response to this, Mir devastated the lands of the seneschal and of Raymond of Cerdanya, who had made peace with the count.Shideler, 21 and n52. Already before 1052 Renard Guillem, the younger brother of the count of Cerdanya, had been treated disgracefully (with mala et onta) by Mir Geribert while on a mission for the count of Barcelona. In 1059 Mir Geribert and his followers made their final submission to the count, relinquishing his disputed rights in the Pened√®s and Ausona.Kosto, 118. He and his wife Guisla promised to make their eldest sons, Bernat and Arnau, renounce the family's claims to the disputed castles and honores when they attained their majority, to make their younger sons sign the charter donating Castell de Port to the count, and to extract oaths of fidelity from their sons in accordance with their own oaths. Mir Geribert died at Tortosa in 1060. Sources *Bensch, Stephen P. Barcelona and Its Rulers, 1096-1291\\\\. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995. . *Bisson, Thomas N.

Content of the report  The report stated that ordinary revenues in France were exceeding expenditure by over 10 million livres. The health of the accounts as reported in the Compte rendu boosted confidence among lenders and ordinary people, who saw Necker as a strong financial manager due to his prior experience as a banker; the report bolstered his reputation further. As a consequence, the French government was able to raise new loans to pay for the costs of continued involvement in the American War of Independence.Adcock, M. (2004). Analysing the French Revolution. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. However, Necker's reporting of the accounts obscured the financial problems which the country was facing: it did not report the extraordinary accounts, where the real cost of the war was to be found and which showed France in a significant deficit ‚Äì between 1777 and 1781, Necker had raised 520 million livres in new loans.Fenwick, J. and Anderson, J. (2006). Revolution: France. HTAV. Had these been reported, lenders would have been unlikely to continue to lend money for the war.  Contribution to a revolutionary situation  The Compte rendu was accepted because of Necker's reputation, but it also acted to bolster that reputation; despite the costs of war, it seemed that France remained in a strong financial position. Necker attained high popularity among ordinary people, who were particularly sympathetic to a minister who, unusual for someone in high office, had been a commoner. After Necker left his position as finance minister, there was a succession of finance ministers under whom the true financial situation came to light. The Compte rendu was also arguably a factor in causing resistance to attempts in 1787 by the then-finance minister Calonne to reform the financial system. Calonne argued that the state finances were in a poor state and thus required overhaul to ensure greater efficiency in taxation. The Assembly of Notables, to whom the reforms were initially proposed, were sceptical of this explanation, possibly as a consequence of the belief that France remained in a strong position from the time of Necker. After a succession of different finance ministers, Louis later re-appointed Necker in the view that he was in the best position to manage France's growing credit problems. Necker remained as popular as ever, which meant that when he was dismissed on 11 July 1789, a public outcry ensued. Combined with the simultaneous economic crisis ‚Äì the price of grain had skyrocketed over the winter of 1787‚Äì8; this contributed to the storming of the Bastille on 14 July.

The station commenced transmissions on 27 November 1965. History During the 1970s, STV formed a programming and operational affiliation with GLV-10 (later GLV-8) in Traralgon and BCV-8 in Bendigo ‚Äì a partnership expanded upon in 1982 with the establishment of a single on-air identity and programming schedule across the three stations, known originally as Southern Cross TV8 and later, the Southern Cross Network. STV was brought by ENT Ltd. in 1989 and split from the Southern Cross Network shortly afterwards to join the VICTV Television Victoria network, which also encompassed GMV-6 Shepparton and BTV-6 Ballarat and following aggregation, extended its transmission area into Bendigo, Albury and Gippsland. The VIC TV network was sold to WIN Television in 1994. However, Mildura did not aggregate until 1 July 1997, when Prime Television launched to become a Seven Network affiliate while WIN Mildura became a dual Nine and Ten affiliate. On 30 June 2010, the station ceased broadcasting on analogue as part of the digital TV switchover in the Mildura area. On 1 July 2016, as part of a wide national re- alignment of regional television, STV swapped affiliations with MDV switching from Nine Network to Network Ten, rebroadcasting a feed of ATV-10 from Melbourne with local ads. =Programming= WIN Mildura broadcasts its programming from Channel Ten (formerly Channel Nine). =WIN News Sunraysia= For nearly 50 years, the station produced regional news bulletins from its Mildura studios.

He works as the South American correspondent providing analysis on soccer throughout the continent since moving to Uruguay in February 2005. He is well known at SI.com for his exclusive interviews, after having interviewed some of South America's top soccer players, most notably those from Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay. These have included Diego Forl√°n, Lu√≠s Fabiano, Hern√°n Crespo, √Ålvaro Recoba, Gabriel Heinze, Gonzalo Higua√≠n, Daniel Alves, Diego Lugano, Rodrigo Palacio, and Guillermo Barros Schelotto. One of his most controversial pieces for Sports Illustrated was about the serious and unpleasant effects of Hooliganism, on Argentine soccer. He also provides commentary on several important international competitions, such as the FIFA World Cup, the Copa Am√©rica, The FIFA Club World Cup, The Copa Libertadores, and the Copa Sudamericana. He often includes his predictions for these tournaments. Sica graduated from Edith Cowan University in 2004, where he majored in both journalism and advertising. He decided to take up a career in journalism, after a serious injury put his soccer career to an end at the age of 19. He was an attacking midfielder for the youth team of Perth Glory, an A-League Australian soccer team.

Etymology The first element ban (Thai: ‡∏ö‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ô) means village. The second element sam (Thai: ‡∏™‡∏≤‡∏°) means three. The third element ruen (Thai: ‡πÄ‡∏£‡∏∑‡∏≠‡∏ô) can either mean dwelling place, or it can be a classifier used to count oblique faces such as the faces of a gem or faces of clocks. The meaning of the name as a whole loosely means Village of Three Faces. Geography Ban Sam Ruen is located in the south-west portion of Nakhon Pa Mak on the Wang Thong River. The Wang Thong flows into Sam Ruen from the north-west and out of the village to the south. A canal which leads to Ban Grong Greng runs out of Ban Sam Ruen from the north-east.Google Earth The resulting pattern divides the land into three plots. At Ban Grong Greng, the Sam Ruen Canal makes its first split, one extension turning west toward Ban Dongphayom, and the other extending north. The canal has many branches, and forms a complex canal system which provides irrigation for much of Nakhon Pa Mak. Ban Sam Ruen is within the Nan River watershed. Economy Ban Sam Ruen was home to the largest market in Phitsanulok until 1898 when the market moved to Ban Wang Thong further north- east along the Wang Thong River. Alternate Identities: The Chinese of Contemporary Thailand Today, Ban Sam Ruen is a rural rice-farming village.Pitlok.net (Thai) Wat Rat Samosom Wat Rat Samosom, () or colloquially Wat Sam Ruen, is a modern Theravada Buddhist temple located in Ban Sam Ruen. Wat Sam Ruen on WebWat.net (Thai) It is the temple at which villagers and residents of the nearby village of Ban Dongphayom conduct ordinary religious activities and ceremonies. Funerals are not held at Wat Sam Ruen, but rather at nearby Wat Grung See Jayrin. Wat Rat Samosom School Students in Cafeteria at Sam Ruen Elementary School Within Ban Sam Ruen is Wat Rat Samosom School, referred to by most as Sam Ruen School. Wat Rat Samosom School is Sam Ruen's elementary and high school, which provides basic education for villagers of Ban Sam Ruen and neighboring villages in Nakhon Pa Mak. It is one of four elementary schools in Nakhon Pa Mak, and the subdistrict's only high school. It was strictly an elementary school until around 1990, when an additional high school building was added. Prior to 1990, Nakhon Pa Mak children who wished to attend high school were required to find private transportation to the nearest high school in Mueang Bang Krathum. Each day at Sam Ruen School begins with the raising of the Thai flag, conducted by one male and one female student, while the remainder of the student and faculty body sing the Thai national anthem. Classes include Thai language, mathematics, Thai history, civics, sewing and agriculture. Lunch is provided by parents of the students who take turns volunteering in the preparation and food service. There are recreational and intramural sports activities on the soccer field and basketball court, but no competitive sports teams.

He was responsible for early editions of works by many of the playwrights of the period, including William Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, John Webster, Thomas Middleton, Thomas Dekker, Thomas Heywood, James Shirley, and John Ford. Life and work Okes was the son of a \\"horner,\\" a man who made hornbooks for the elementary education of small children; Okes's grandfather may have been a lute player. Nicholas Okes began his apprenticeship with printer Richard Field at Christmas 1595. He was made a \\"freeman\\" (full member) of the Stationers Company on 5 December 1603. His career advanced in 1606, in connection with the printing establishment of George and Lionel Snowden; Lionel left the firm and Okes took the man's place as George Snowden's partner (29 January 1606). Snowden, in turn, left the business on 13 April 1607, when Okes bought him out. Okes continued to use the Snowden's characteristic device, a winged horse above a caduceus (as on the title page of Lear, Q1) ‚Äì though he later used an ornament of Jupiter riding an eagle between two oak trees. The Snowden firm was long-standing, having been founded in 1586 by Thomas Judson; though at the start Okes possessed only a single press, two workmen, and a limited supply of type. Over time, however, Okes built a successful concern. In February 1624, at St. Faith's in London, Okes married Mary Pursett, daughter of a fellow stationer, Christopher Pursett. In a career that spanned more than three decades, Okes printed materials on a wide variety of subjects: history, literature, religion, science and mathematics, trade, travel, geography, cartography, even cookbooks. Yet his play texts have attracted the lion's share of attention from scholars, critics, and bibliographers. Shakespeare One of Okes's earliest jobs was the printing of the fifth edition of Shakespeare's The Rape of Lucrece (1607) for the bookseller John Harrison (the fourth octavo edition, O4; often called, inaccurately, Q5).F. E. Halliday, A Shakespeare Companion 1564‚Äì1964, Baltimore, Penguin, 1964; p. 341. In the following year, 1608, Okes printed the famous and crucial first quarto of King Lear for Nathaniel Butter. Q1 of Lear was the first play (of many) printed by Okes; it has been argued that some of the peculiarities in that intensely studied volume resulted from the inexperience of Okes and his compositors with works of drama.Peter W. M. Blayney, The Texts of King Lear and Their Origins; Vol. 1: Nicholas Okes and the First Quarto, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1982.Jay L. Halio, ed., The First Quarto of King Lear, The New Cambridge Shakespeare: The Early Quartos. Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1994. In 1622, Okes printed the first quarto of Othello for Thomas Walkley. Okes worked on several projects with Walkley in the years around 1622 ‚Äì though he also took Walkley to court in a financial dispute. (This in itself was not unusual: Walkley struggled financially in his early years in business and was sued by other colleagues, too.) In a more remote Shakespearean connection, Okes printed The Merry Conceited Jests of George Peele (1607) for Francis Faulkner and Henry Bell. This was a key source for The Puritan, one of the plays of the Shakespeare Apocrypha. And others Okes printed a range of other texts in Jacobean and Caroline drama, beyond the confines of the Shakespeare canon. They include:E. K. Chambers, The Elizabethan Stage, 4 Volumes, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1923; pp. 345, 383, 498, 509‚Äì10. * Gervase Markham's The Dumb Knight (1608), for John Bache; * Jonson's The Masque of Queens (1609), for Richard Bonian and Henry Walley; * Dekker and Middleton's The Roaring Girl (1611), for Thomas Archer; * Arthur Hopton's Speculum Topographicum, or The Topographicall Glassee (1611), for Simon Waterson; * Webster's The White Devil (1612), also for Thomas Archer;Hammond, Anthony. \\"The White Devil in Nicholas Okes's Shop.\\" Studies in Bibliography 39 (1986), pp. 135‚Äì76. * Heywood's The Brazen Age (1613), for Samuel Rand; * John Cooke's Greene's Tu Quoque (1614), for John Trundle; * Thomas Tomkis's Albumazar (1615), for Walter Burre (plus two subsequent editions); * the first two quartos of Beaumont and Fletcher's Philaster (1620, 1622), both for Walkley; * Webster's The Duchess of Malfi (1623), for John Waterson; * Shirley's The Wedding (1629), for John Grove; * Ford's 'Tis Pity She's a Whore (1633), for Richard Collins; * Heywood's A Maidenhead Well Lost (1634), for John Jackson and Francis Church; * and some of the city entertainments of Thomas Dekker. (In some cases, the line between bookseller/publisher and printer may not have been as clear-cut as in others. It is worth noting that Albumazar was entered into the Stationers' Register on 28 April 1615 ‚Äì not by publisher Burre as would have been the norm, but by printer Okes; which suggests that Okes was more than just the printer hired for the job.) The above list represents first editions. Okes also printed: * the third, fourth, and sixth quartos of Dekker's The Honest Whore, Part 1 (1615, 1616, 1635), for Robert Basse (#3, #4) and Richard Collins (#6); * the second and third editions of Tomkis's Lingua (1617, 1622), for Simon Waterson; * the second and third editions of Francis Beaumont's The Knight of the Burning Pestle (both 1635) for John Smethwick; * the collected edition of Samuel Daniel's plays (1623), for Simon Waterson. Inevitably, Okes also printed works of many sorts that had nothing to do with the drama; these included religious works by John Donne and others ‚Äì and also Thomas Cooper's The Mystery of Witchcraft (1617). He printed Robert Tofte's translation of Ariosto's Satires (1608) for Roger Jackson, and Gervase Markham's The English Arcadia (1613) for Thomas Saunders. Okes also printed Rachel Speght's A Muzzle for Melastomus (1617) for Thomas Archer ‚Äì one of the few works authored by a woman printed in this period. Publishing Like most printers of his historical period, Okes concentrated on printing, and left publishing decisions to the booksellers who commissioned jobs from him. And yet, again like most printers of the era, Okes did a limited amount of publishing himself. (Booksellers and printers were all members of the Stationers Company, and could publish books and other works; but the practicalities of the retail book business made booksellers the logical and primary publishers.) Okes's title pages identify his business as \\"near Holborn Bridge\\" and \\"in Foster Lane.\\" Okes published the first quartos of Heywood's Age quintet: The Golden Age (1611), The Silver Age (1613), The Brazen Age (1613) and his The Iron Age, Parts 1 and 2 (1632), as well as the first and second quarto of Heywood's The Four Prentices of London (1615, 1632). He published some of Heywood's non-dramatic prose, including his important An Apology for Actors (1612); in that volume, Heywood included an address \\"to his approved good friend, Nicholas Okes,\\" that praises the printer's \\"care and workmanship\\" and calls him \\"careful and industrious\\" and \\"serious and laborious.\\" Okes also published the texts of some of the city entertainments common in the era, including several written by Thomas Middleton when he was City Chronologer of London, plus others by John Webster and Anthony Munday. As with his printing, Okes published non-dramatic works as well as plays. One example is Samuel Daniel's The Collection of the History of England (1618); another is Robert Chamberlain's A New Book of Mistakes (1637). He published Anthony Munday's translation of Amadis de Gaul (1618‚Äì19), one of the chivalric romances that were enormously popular in the era. Okes published A Short Treatise on Magnetical Bodies and Motions (1613) by Mark Ridley, a follower of William Gilbert, and John Napier's A Description of the Admirable Table of Logarithms (1616). Printers who published usually needed a retail outlet for their wares. The title page of Okes's edition of The Silver Age states that the book would be sold by Benjamin Lightfoote. Okes's edition of Richard Jobson's The Golden Trade (1623) was sold by Nicholas Bourne; his edition of Sir Thomas Overbury's translation of Ovid (1620) was sold by John Wells. Controversy A number of printers and publishers of Okes's era got into trouble with the strict censorship policies of the Stuart regime, resulting in fines and occasional imprisonment. Nathaniel Butter, Okes's publisher for Lear, served time in jail for his professional activities. Okes was in difficulties throughout his career for printing works without official approval; when he printed George Wither's controversial Satires (1621) without registration, Okes ended up in jail himself. He was imprisoned again in 1637, for his second edition of Francis de Sales' Introduction to a Devout Life. Okes had altered the text after it was approved by the authorities, re- inserting Catholic phraseology. The 1637 trouble was serious. Okes probably knew that the Star Chamber was planning to restrict the number of master printers to a total of twenty; and given his record, he knew that he would not be among those twenty. Okes wrote a letter to Archbishop Laud, offering to step aside from his business if his son John (see below) would be among the twenty master printers. His effort was futile; neither Okes was among the restricted group of masters. The Stuarts, however, were better at proclaiming laws than at enforcing them; and they were distracted by other aspects of the political turmoil leading up to the English Civil War. The Okes firm managed to stay in business \\"by indulgence.\\"Auchter, Dorothy. Dictionary of Literary and Dramatic Censorship in Tudor and Stuart England. Westport, CT, Greenwood Press, 2001: pp. 169‚Äì70. At this historical remove, it is impossible to say whether Okes's choices over the problematic works he printed stemmed from economic motives, religious or political values, simple stubbornness, or a commitment to the earliest concepts of freedom of the press. Father and son John Okes,Henry Robert Plomer, A Dictionary of the Booksellers and Printers Who Were at Work in England, Scotland and Ireland from 1641 to 1667, The Bibliographical Society/Blades, East & Blades, 1907; p. 141. son of Nicholas, served an apprenticeship under his father and became a freeman of the Stationers Company on 14 January 1627. For some years he was in partnership with his father; together they printed Heywood's The Royal King and the Loyal Subject (1637) for James Becket, and Richard Brathwaite's The Lives of All the Roman Emperors (1636) for George Hutton. John Okes continued in business on his own after his father's retirement; he was situated in Little St. Bartholomew's near Smithfield. He printed James Shirley's The Grateful Servant (1637) for William Leake; and Richard Brome's The Sparagus Garden and The Antipodes for Francis Constable, and Thomas Nabbes's The Unfortunate Mother for Daniel Frere (all 1640). He printed and published William Rowley's play A Shoemaker a Gentleman (1638) and Jonson's masque The Gypsies Metamorphosed (1640). (Like his father, printer/publisher John Okes needed a retail outlet for his products; his edition of Rowley's play was sold by bookseller John Cooper.)Chambers, Vol. 3, p. 473. The younger Okes continued in his father's role as a primary publisher of Heywood's non- dramatic prose. John Okes died in 1644. His widow Mary continued his business, like some other stationers' widows did; but she does not appear to have succeeded or endured. For a brief historical moment, however, Mary Okes was at the center of attention of the English nation ‚Äì when she testified about the Introduction to a Devout Life matter at the 1644 trial of Archbishop Laud.Hamilton, Donna B. Anthony Munday and the Catholics, 1560‚Äì1633. London, Ashgate, 2005; p. 99.

Jacob and August Deibel were the most successful Dutch pilots on the Brewster F2A fighter. He was twice awarded the Military William Order for bravery in battle. World War II =Singapore= Van Helsdingen's squadron arrived in Singapore on 9 December 1941 with 9-12 Brewster Buffalo fighters and was stationed at Kallang Airfield. They first went into action on 12 January 1942 during a Japanese air raid over Singapore. At 10:00 hours, a formation of Japanese bombers appeared, escorted by five Ki-27 Nates. They were intercepted by three Dutch Buffalos, who succeeded in chasing them away, damaging one of the bombers. When they returned in the afternoon, Van Helsdingen and two other pilots were scrambled to intercept them, encountering nine Ki-27s. Four of them were shot down, one by Van Helsdingen, with the Dutch losing one Buffalo. When the Japanese raided Singapore again on 15 January, Van Helsdingen and two other pilots took off. They ran into an overwhelming number of A6M Zeros, scoring no kills and losing one Buffalo and its pilot. His squadron returned to Java on 18 January, missing out on the Battle of Singapore. Van Helsdingen led eight Buffalos to Semplak, while 23 others flew to Andir and Tjilitian.Brewster Buffalo: in Dutch service =Balikpapan= Van Helsdingen was awarded his first Military William Order on 11 February 1942, for carrying out attacks against Imperial Japanese Navy ships in the Battle of Balikpapan on 23 January. Twenty Buffalo fighters carrying two 50 kg bombs each escorted nine Martin B-10 bombers to attack a fleet of IJN ships in the Makassar Strait. Eight hits were scored on four Japanese ships and one destroyer, sinking two transports, with the Dutch losing one Buffalo. =Lembang= Van Helsdingen was killed on his 35th birthday by an A6M Zero while providing air support to Royal Dutch East Indies Army forces fighting in Lembang with three other Buffalo aircraft on 7 March 1942. Despite the Japanese having an almost complete air superiority over Java, he nevertheless chose to take off from Andir airfield. He ordered another pilot to stand down and hand over his Buffalo aircraft to him because he was married, despite the fact that Van Helsdingen was himself married. Three other pilots, 1st Lieutenant August Deibel, Gerard Bruggink (flying B-3107) and Officer Cadet Jan Scheffer, volunteered to join him using the last three working Buffalo aircraft on the airfield. The squadron travelled 200 metres before running into three Japanese A6M Zeros. Deibel's plane was hit in the oil tank and had to break off from combat. His wingman, Scheffer, escorted him back to Andir airfield, where Deibel crash landed his aircraft without injury. The other two remained above Lembang, but were now dogfighting six Zeroes. Van Helsdingen shot down a Zero before he too was hit, but Bruggink managed to escape into the clouds before returning to Andir airfield. Jacob's body was never found. The Dutch forces in Lembang surrendered the next day. All four Dutch pilots were awarded the Military William Order, while Van Helsdingen and Scheffer (who died a prisoner of war) were posthumously awarded the honour on 14 July 1948.

He also documented the American Civil War era during his service in the Confederate Army. Walker was born to an Irish Protestant father and a mother of South Carolina background in Charleston, South Carolina in 1839. In 1841, after his father died, Walker's family remained in Charleston where Walker grew up. (Seibels) In 1861, during the American Civil War, Walker was conscripted in the Confederate Army and was sent to Morris Island as part of the Palmetto Guard. Almost immediately, Walker was sent on to Richmond and Camp Davis. Four months later, he received a medical discharge from the army. For the remainder of the war he served as a civilian draftsman to the Confederate Engineers Corps and made maps and drawings of Charleston's defenses. (Seibels) He was separated from the military at the end of 1864. After the Civil War, Walker moved to Baltimore, where he produced small paintings of the \\"Old South\\" to sell as tourist souvenirs. In 1868 Walker painted the ruins of the Cathedral of Saint John and Saint Finbar that burned down in December 1861 in a fire that ravaged Charleston, South Carolina. He is best known for his paintings depicting the lives of poor black emancipated slaves, especially sharecroppers in the post-Reconstruction American South.

It is located on the west bank of the Missouri River in Lyman and Stanley counties in central South Dakota in the United States. It is adjacent to the Crow Creek Indian Reservation on the east bank of the river. The Kul Wicasa Oyate (lower‚Ä¶men‚Ä¶nation), the Lower Brul√© Sioux, are members of the Sicangu (Burnt Thigh), one of the bands of the Lakota Tribe. Tribal headquarters is in Lower Brule. History The Sioux consist of a group of self-governing tribes speaking one of three dialects of the Siouan language: Dakota, Nakota and Lakota. The Dakota or Santee, who identify as by the autonymns of Mdewakantonwan, Wahpetowan, Wahpekute, or Sisseton, range in territory from the Ohio River valley to South Dakota. The Dakota or Nakota, known as the Ihanktonwan/Yankton or Yanktonai/Ihanktonwanna, range from eastern Minnesota to the Missouri River valley. The Lakota, or Western Teton/Tituwan Sioux, consisting of the Oglala, Mniconjou, Sicangu, Sihasapa, Oohenunpa, Hunkpapa, and Itazipco, traditionally ranged from lands east of the Missouri River valley to the Rocky Mountains. A common history and language, a strong respect for the land and nature, the common use of Pipestone and the reverence held for the stone, and ceremonies such as the Sun Dance, Sweat lodge, and Vision Quest, bind these peoples together. The name 'Brule' comes from the French word br√ªl√© (burnt), the name French fur traders used for the Sicangu in the late 17th century. The Sicangu divided into the Lower Brul√© and the Heyata Wicasa, or Upper Brul√©, in the late 18th century. The Lower Brul√© favored lands at the confluence of the White River and the Missouri River, while the Upper Brul√© lived further south and west. The tribe has been working to improve the environment of the reservation and to protect its sacred places. In 2013, the tribe requested that the KELO-TV station find a new site for a transmission tower on Medicine Butte that had fallen. Medicine Butte rises about 200 feet above the prairie and is sacred to the Brul√©. The town of Reliance developed nearby. KELO-TV agreed to the tribe's request and placed a new tower elsewhere. Employment Major employers are the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe, its Golden Buffalo Casino, Bureau of Indian Affairs, and Indian Health Service. The gaming casino has generated new revenue for the tribe. Government Two \\"painted horses\\" grazing near the Missouri River on the Lower Brule Indian Reservation The Lower Brule Sioux Tribe is a sovereign nation defined by its government-to-government relationship with the United States. As part of the Great Sioux Nation, the Tribe signed treaties in 1824, 1851, 1865 and 1868 with the federal government that constitute the legal documents establishing boundaries and recognizing the rights of sovereign tribal governments. The Tribe was chartered under the Indian Reorganization Act of June 18, 1934. Its constitution was ratified on July 11, 1936, and bylaws were approved in 1960. The Tribe has contracted several aspects of self-government under the 1975 Indian Self Determination and Education Assistance Act, PL 93-638. On June 17, 1974, the constitution and bylaws were amended, and on September 2, 1986, they were again amended and a code of ethics adopted. Tribal affairs are conducted by a six-member Tribal Council who are elected to serve two-year terms. Council offices include the chairman, vice-chairman, secretary/treasurer, and three Council members. The Tribal Council Chairman serves as the Chief Executive Officer and Administrative head of the Tribe. The Chairman, Vice-Chairman, and Secretary- Treasurer, and the three Council Member positions are elected at-large. =Elections= A general election is held on the first Tuesday of September in even numbered years. Chairman, Vice-Chairman, and Secretary and Treasurer are elected at-large. The tribal council appoints, a Sergeant at Arms, a Chaplain, and other officers as necessary. Offices are held for two years. Elections consist of a Primary and General Election. The Primaries are held in August and the General is held in September, with Officials being seated during the October regular meeting. Council members also serve as officers or council representatives on various boards and committees. =Council meetings= Meetings are held the first Wednesday of each month with a quorum of five members. Courts The Lower Brule Sioux Tribal courts are established under a quasi-separation of power relationship with the Tribal Government. The 1986 Constitution/By-law amendments created the Chief Judge as an elected position, with a 4-year term. While the Tribal Council is the final authority on the Reservation, it has formally acknowledged the legal authority necessarily vested in the Tribal Courts. The Lower Brule Sioux Court system also has established an appellate court and attendant processes. The Court hears all civil and minor criminal cases, while the federal courts hear all major felony cases. Infrastructure As part of the Pick-Sloan Missouri River Basin program, authorized by Congress in 1944 for flood control, two major dams and other flood control projects were built in this area by the federal government. It acquired property on the Lower Brule Indian Reservation for two dam projects: 7,997 acres of Indian land for the Fort Randall Dam project and 14,299 acres for the Big Bend Dam project.PL 105-132, Lower Brule Sioux Tribe Infrastructure Development Trust Fund Act , 1997 In 1963, the Big Bend Dam on the Missouri River was completed by the Army Corps of Engineers. The operation of the dam caused flooding of the Lower Brule community and surrounding bottomlands in the heart of the reservation. The waters inundated miles of roadways and a significant amount of the most productive and fertile farmland of the Reservation; it destroyed most of the Reservation‚Äôs native trees, shrubs and medicinal plants, which were located chiefly along the river bottomlands. By Public Law 87-734 (76 Stat. 698 et seq.), the Secretary of the Army was to provide mitigation for such damages, including replacing roads and facilities. The government failed to carry out its obligations under the act. In 1997 the federal government enacted the Lower Brule Infrastructure Development Trust Fund Act in compensation for the lands and infrastructure lost due to construction of the Big Bend Dam and flooding of the reservoir. The act was also intended to enable the tribe to share in the benefits of these projects. It provided for payments to the tribe of amounts beginning in 1998 and annually until the aggregated of $39.3 million had been accumulated in the trust fund. In response, the Tribe created a plan for how it would use such funds for facilities and development to aid the tribe. It also established the Infrastructure Development Authority, a committee of tribal members who oversee the Trust Fund, and recommend action and expenditures to the Tribal Council. Since establishment of the Trust Fund, the Authority has supervised development of the Administration Building and Community Center located in Lower Brule. The Authority is also overseeing construction of the Lower Brule Justice Center. The tribe has established the Buffalo Interpretive Center, providing insight into the people and their customs. Local telephone service is furnished by the Golden West Telephone Company, as well as various cell phone providers. Internet services are available through Golden West and the West Central Rural Electric Cooperative. The Reservation has approximately 200 miles of roads. These include 107 miles of gravel roads, 65 miles of asphalt, 11 miles of graded dirt roads, and 10 miles of unimproved roads. The Lower Brule Sioux Tribe is a member of the West Central Rural Electric Cooperative. The majority of tribal members are also Cooperative members, as it is the major electricity provider in west central South Dakota. The Tribe operates a propane company and serves all residences within the reservation, as well as areas adjacent to the reservation. Unleaded and diesel gasoline are available at the local gas station. Fuel oil is available from the nearest Fanners Union in Reliance, South Dakota (15 miles). The Lake Sharpe Reservoir serves as a virtually unlimited water source for the Lower Brule community. The Lower Brule Sioux Tribe's Rural Water System (RWSS) supplies clean water to the communities of Lower Brule and West Brule for both domestic and agricultural use. This system is a part of the Mni Wiconi Water Project, authorized to provide water for the Pine Ridge Reservation, Rosebud Reservation, Lower Brule Reservation and counties located in west central South Dakota. The Lower Brule Sioux Tribe, in coordination with the Indian Health Service, operates a solid waste collection and transfer facility. The Solid Waste Program gathers all solid waste from receptacles located throughout the reservation. All solid waste is disposed in approved landfill facilities in Pierre and Pukwana, South Dakota. The Lower Brule Sioux Tribe, in coordination with the Indian Health Service, operates a sewage disposal and treatment system for the towns of Lower Brule and West Brule. The major treatment for wastewater is evaporation and settling in evaporation and settling ponds in two lagoon areas; the system uses limited aeration. Housing There are 392 residences on the reservation, 300 of them constructed with U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development funds. The Lower Brule Housing Authority manages 228 of the homes. Only 36.8 percent of the units on the reservation are owner-occupied, compared to a State average of 68.2 percent. The housing market is very tight on the reservation, with the majority of housing intended for low-income residents. The Tribe is planning to develop additional market-rate housing to meet the needs of Tribal residents who do not satisfy the low-income requirements. Other services Lower Brule has an Elderly Center that provides an elderly nutrition program and other activities and a Teen Center that sponsors youth recreational activities. The Tribe‚Äôs $5.8 million Veteran's Memorial Community Center has a swimming pool, full-size basketball court, weight and exercise rooms, and a large kitchen. The Tribe contracts with Indian Health Services to operate a Tribal Health Department that oversees the tribal ambulance services and employs Community Health Representatives. The Tribal Health Department provides examinations and eyeglasses to tribal members at reduced costs, as well as coordinating health delivery services. The Lower Brule IHS Service Unit operates a dental clinic, medical clinic and conducts several outreach programs, which provide services to the Members of the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe on a regular basis, and to anyone in an emergency. Full-service hospital facilities are available in the neighboring communities of Chamberlain and Pierre. Recreation The Golden Buffalo Casino operates a Convention Center that holds 120 people comfortably. A Horseman's Club sponsors several \\"Play Days\\" throughout the summer. The Tribe has a recreational area and boat launch at South Iron Nation and other informal beach areas, and boat ramps along the shoreline of the Missouri River. Transportation Commercial airline, freight, and train services are available in Pierre. The town of Chamberlain provides the nearest landing strip and bus service. Truck service is available locally, and most retail businesses on the reservation receive service from suppliers in distributor-owned trucks. There are charter buses and limousines serving patrons of the Golden Buffalo Casino, and Greyhound Bus terminals are located in Chamberlain and Pierre. River City Transit runs a daily bus/van transportation service between Lower Brule and Pierre. Education The Lower Brule Education system consists of a Head-start Program, a K-6 elementary school, a 7-8 middle school, and a 9-12 High School. The Tribe also operates the Lower Brule Community College, accredited under Sinte Gleska University of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe. In addition, the Tribe is involved in a Video- Cultural Program in which students, teachers and elders document important cultural activities and histories. Notable tribal members * Chief Iron Nation (1815‚Äì1894) led the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe through some of its most challenging years. He worked both as a warrior and statesman to ensure the survival of his people. Iron Nation signed the treaty to establish the Great Sioux Reservation in 1868. He has been described as a just and noble leader. *Michael Jandreau (1943-2015) helped lead the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe during difficult years of transition immediately prior to, and forty continuous years after, the passage of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975. Jandreau was elected to the Lower Brule Sioux Tribal Council an unprecedented twenty-two (22) consecutive two-year terms. He served as Chairman for eighteen (18) terms; his final term was only six months as he died while in office. Representation in other media Jim Miller, a spiritual leader and Vietnam veteran, organized a group ride by horseback in 2012 following a vivid dream. They traveled from South Brule to Mankato, Minnesota, reaching it by December 26, the 150th anniversary of the largest mass execution in United States history. After bands surrendered at the end of the Dakota War of 1862, warriors were tried by a US military tribunal. Thirty- nine Dakota warriors were sentenced to be executed by hanging, and one was spared. More than 250 men were held several years as prisoners. The group from South Brule made their ride to encourage healing and reconciliation, both within their group, and for the people they encountered. A documentary film, Dakota 38, was made of their journey, and they are distributing it for free, as part of the healing.Dakota 38, 2012, Smooth Feather Productions References External links * \\"Lower Brul√© Sioux Tribe\\", South Dakota Office of Tribal Government Relations * Recipe: Blueberry Wojapi, Native Tech Category:Brul√© Category:American Indian reservations in South Dakota Category:Geography of Lyman County, South Dakota Category:Geography of Stanley County, South Dakota ","title":"Lower Brule Indian Reservation"},{"id":"13592317","text":"J.E.B.

It is shorter, lighter and less curved than the 1840 model 1860 saber The Model 1860 Light Cavalry Saber (also known as the M1862 as this was when the first 800 were issued) is a long sword made of steel and brass, used by US cavalry from the American Civil War until the end of the Indian wars; some were still in use during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. It was long with a blade and weighed alone or with iron scabbard. Before the Civil War there was no light or heavy cavalry in the US army. Instead there were \\"Dragoons\\" (founded 1830) and \\"Mounted Riflemen\\" (founded c.1840). In 1861 these mounted regiments were renamed cavalry and given yellow piping. The M1860 saber received its name to distinguish it from the larger and heavier Model 1840 Heavy Cavalry Saber that it replaced. Like its predecessor it had a brass guard, leather-wrapped grip and steel scabbard but unlike the M1840 it was smaller and easier to handle. By the end of the Civil War over 300,000 1860 sabers had been produced: 200,000 by Ames, 32,000 by Roby and many more by firms such as Tiffany and Co, Glaze, Justice, and Emerson and Silver. M1860s were carried not only by cavalry but also by many infantry and staff officers as the regulation Model 1850 Army Staff & Field Officers' Sword had to be privately purchased. High-ranking officers, like their European counterparts, often had their swords ornately engraved with gilding and foliage. Famous users included George Armstrong Custer and J.E.B. Stuart.

In 2002, the media reported him missing while working undercover on a story in one of Rio's favelas. It was later learned that Lopes had been accosted by drug traffickers who controlled the area, was kidnapped, driven to the top of a neighboring favela in the trunk of a car, tied to a tree and subjected to a mock trial, tortured by having his hands, arms, and legs severed with a sword while still alive, and then had his body placed within tires, covered in gasoline and set on fire‚Äîa practice that traffickers have dubbed micro-ondas (allusion to the microwave oven). The details of Lopes's death received substantial attention in Brazil's media because of the barbarity of the crime and due to it highlighting the existence of poder paralelo (parallel power) within Rio‚Äîmeaning criminals controlling areas of the city with impunity. Early life and personal life Tim Lopes was born Arcanjo Antonino Lopes do Nascimento in Pelotas, Brazil, the fourth child of a family of twelve. When he was 8 years old, his parents moved the family to Rio de Janeiro, where they lived in humble circumstances in the Mangueira favela in a three-room shanty.From documentary \\"Journalists Killed in the Line of Duty\\" (2005); sponsored by The Committee to Protect Journalists; Produced by Feature Docs; Narrated by Anderson Cooper Hill which is part of the Mangueira favela where Lopes grew up in Rio de JaneiroMangueira is home to the samba school, Mangueira and is located on a hill near Maracan√£ football stadium. Years later as a journalist, Lopes produced a piece about Mangueira samba and one of its founders, the Carioca sambista Carlos Cacha√ßa. Cacha√ßa saw the story and commented to a sambista friend, Monarco, of the Velha Guarda da Portela, that Lopes's reporting was \\"the best material that he had ever seen\\" on Mangueira. In 2002, Lopes was co-writing a book, about Mangueira samba school and his experience growing up there, with Alexander Medeiros. Lopes was one of the founders of the Carnaval bloco, \\"Simpatia √© quase amor\\" of Ipanema, and had served as an official judge of the annual carnival procession at the Sambadrome Marqu√™s de Sapuca√≠. He was a dedicated fan of the professional Rio football club, Vasco da Gama. Lopes lived with his wife Alessandra Wagner and her son Diogo. Lopes also had a nineteen-year-old son, Bruno, from a previous marriage, with whom he maintained a father-son relationship. Although Lopes was born Gaucho (native resident of Rio Grande do Sul), \\"he was a stereotypical Carioca\\" (native resident of Rio de Janeiro), always smiling with a friendly disposition and knowing every corner of Rio. He was at ease hanging out with wealthy residents in Leblon or with those living in poor areas of the city or on the street, and in speaking street slang. Career Tim Lopes attended journalism school at the Faculdade H√©lio Alonso (FACHA) in Rio de Janeiro and during his career wrote for the Rio newspapers O Globo, O Dia, and Jornal do Brasil. As part of an investigative piece in 1978, Lopes worked at a construction site on Rio's underground Metro to highlight difficult working conditions in the stifling heat. Lopes won a Brazilian journalism award called the Pr√™mio Abril de Jornalismo in both 1985 and 1986 for feature stories involving football in the sports magazine Placar. Tim Lopes's journalism colleagues described him as an old-school type reporter who gleaned his stories from researching on the street as opposed to sitting in an air-conditioned office browsing the Internet for ideas. A consistent theme of Tim Lopes's reporting was to show how low-income citizens living within Rio's favelas could be subjected to terror and powerlessness under the 'law of the traffickers.'CESeC - Centro de Estudos de Seguran√ßa e Cidadania Lopes felt that the government had ceded control of poor neighborhoods to violent drug traffickers. An example of this was the series he wrote for the Rio newspaper O Dia in 1994 entitled, \\"Funk: Som, Alegria, e Terror,\\" (Funk: Sound, Joy, and Terror). The story described certain baile funk run by traffickers (baile funk are dance concerts held in favelas featuring live performers singing a style of rap called Rio Funk). His first foray into broadcast journalism was for the popular newsmagazine program Fant√°stico on the Globo network. During one assignment in 1995, Lopes posed as a street vendor while concealing a camera within a cooler. His aim was to shine a journalistic light on the risks posed to ordinary citizens of Rio of being mugged or assaulted by thieves, as this was a particularly acute reality at that time. During the course of the investigation, Lopes witnessed a dramatic scene which was all caught on camera: A group of teenagers mug a pedestrian couple in Rio's Centro business district, with one of the thieves wielding a large knife. When a taxi driver scares the mugger off by firing a revolver, the boy runs into heavy traffic on Avenida Presidente Vargas and is violently killed when he is hit by a city bus. Several Globo cameras were filming the entire episode from different angles, which was shown during the report (a black bar covered a portion of the frame at the moment the boy was killed). The scene weighed on Lopes's mind for a long time. Lopes became a producer at Rede Globo in 1996. In 2001 Lopes and his team at Rede Globo received the Pr√™mio Esso (Brazil's version of the Pulitzer) for an investigative series entitled \\"Feir√£o das Drogas\\" (\\"Big Drug Fair\\"), in which he used a hidden camera to show dealers on the street openly hawking cocaine to passing pedestrians, yelling out the drug and its price. His footage also captured armed traffickers parading past on motorcycles with AK-47s. This footage was shot in a dense network of favelas in the Zona Norte called the Complexo do Alem√£o (German Complex); more specifically within the Complexo this particular area is known as the Grota. One of the reporters working on Lopes's team to collect undercover footage for the same investigative report was Globo journalist Cristina Guimar√£es. She filmed in the Rio favelas of Mangueira and Rocinha during the same time period. The report was televised in Brazil on the program Jornal Nacional on August 3, 2001. The report got a lot of attention, which in turn caused Rio's political administration to take action. Police crackdowns followed, and dealers in the favela da Grota, and the other favelas featured were prevented from openly selling drugs on the street for a while, and some were arrested. Subsequently, the drug lords of the criminal factions controlling these areas were not happy with the decrease in revenues. (One of the dealers arrested, \\"Ratinho\\", would later factor in Lopes's death). Tim Lopes and his team were awarded Brazil's top journalism prize for the report which was titled \\"Feir√£o das Drogas\\" (\\"Big Drug Fair\\") - the first Pr√™mio Esso given for broadcast investigative journalism in Brazil. In 2002 Lopes started working on a story about caminhoneiros (long-distance truck drivers that traverse Brazil) for Globo TV. Death =Kidnapping= On the afternoon of June 2, 2002, 51-year-old Tim Lopes left his apartment in a middle class section of Rio's Copacabana neighborhood.Rede Globo headquarters in Rio's Jardim Bot√¢nio neighborhood, where Lopes began working in the broadcast news division in the mid-1990s as an investigative journalist and producer. He was heading to the Vila Cruzeiro favela after first stopping by his office at Rede Globo, where he had been a broadcast producer since 1996. C√©sar Sebra, the man who was Lopes's boss for six years at Rede Globo, recalled: \\"Most of the journalists working at Globo's offices are middle-class. Only a few people live like Tim used to live in the favelas.\\" Lopes had heard that the gang of drug traffickers who controlled Vila Cruzeiro were putting on a baile funk that night. Lopes was tipped off by local residents of the area that traffickers were promoting child prostitution at the bailes funk in Vila Cruzeiro. Days before this night, Lopes had confided to colleagues that he was feeling tired and wanted to take a break from the agitation and violence of the city and find a rural retreat somewhere where he could recuperate. \\"The deeper in the jungle the better,\\" he told them. His awareness of drugs and crime plaguing the city, and the lack of social services for youth to deal with these problems, seemed to drain him of energy. Rio's poor communities, the favelas, had been neglected for decades and were considered outside the control of the State. Filling in this power vacuum were young drug traffickers, who patrolled the favelas with automatic weapons. In addition to drug selling, in certain favelas, traffickers were sexually exploiting minors from the community at their baile funk, sometimes forcing girls to put on explicit shows by having sex out in the open against a wall at these events. Residents were telling Lopes that girls from the local community who didn't participate in the baile funk were targeted for reprisals. Since residents could not go to the police for redress, they instead reached out to Tim Lopes for help. Nassif Elias Sobrinho, president of the Rio journalist union, recalled: \\"Tim Lopes was called because there was no one to hear their problems. The community told the police many times and nothing was done.\\" After leaving his office that afternoon at the Rede Globo television studios, where he left his \\"cell phone, wallet, and dress shirt,\\" Lopes went to the Penha Shopping Mall where he rigged himself with a hidden camera. He was using a micro-camera concealed within a small pack at his waist.Tim Lopes - Journalists Killed - Committee to Protect Journalists One of the purposes of this baile funk was to draw crowds from other neighborhoods, so Lopes's presence there would not have made him a target in and of itself. However, the \\"Feir√£o das Drogas\\" report from the previous year had received a lot of attention and led to numerous arrests. Furthermore, after Lopes and his team had been granted the Pr√™mio Esso, his image was subsequently broadcast all over Rio. On the afternoon of June 2, 2002, Lopes decided to film at a boca de fumo (a drug-selling location) along Rua Oito (Eighth Street) in the Vila Cruzeiro favela. Lopes's aim was to obtain footage of drugs and weapons, as he had in 2001 in the favela da Grota within the Complexo do Alem√£o. It was later learned that before this night, Lopes had recently filmed in Vila Cruzeiro three different times. Inside Vila Cruzeiro, Lopes went to a bar and bought a beer, then walked across the street and hung out on the sidewalk while filming armed traffickers driving by on motorcycles. Lopes was accosted by two members of the criminal faction who controlled Vila Cruzeiro and most of the Complexo do Alem√£o (often just referred to as \\"o Complexo\\"), Andr√© da Cruz Barbosa and Maur√≠cio de Lima Matias. As is common in the criminal underworld, the traffickers were known by their nicknames: Andr√© Capeta (Andr√© Devil) and Boizinho (Little Ox). A young boy had earlier approached Lopes when he was at the bar, and he did not know that the boy was a lookout for a drug dealer. The traffickers became suspicious when someone noticed a small light coming from the pack at Lopes's waist, where his camera was concealed, and reported it to one of the armed traffickers. Upon being confronted, Lopes stated that he was a journalist from Rede Globo. They asked for his journalist credentials, which Lopes did not carry when working undercover. Lopes was subsequently beaten at the scene. Using a Nextel radio, the traffickers called the head drug lord, Elias Pereira da Silva, known by his nickname, Elias Maluco (meaning Crazy Elias or Madman Elias), at the faction's headquarters at the favela da Grota within the Complexo do Alem√£o for instructions. They were told to wait for a car to pick them up to transport Lopes from Vila Cruzeiro across the hills to the top of the Grota in the Complexo do Alem√£o where Elias Maluco was waiting for what he viewed as the captured \\"trophy\\". Before putting him into the trunk of a stolen Fiat Palio, the traffickers shot Lopes in either his feet or legs and tied his hands behind his back. =Murder= The traffickers drove Lopes along a winding back dirt road leading away from the Vila Cruzeiro favela (which is situated in Penha) and into the Complexo do Alem√£o network of favelas, a distance of about on winding roads through hilly terrain (this also being the same route used by groups of fleeing criminals brandishing assault rifles when military police units and the Brazilian military invaded Vila Cruzeiro during the 2010 Rio de Janeiro security crisis). Upon arriving at the Favela da Grota (which was the headquarters of the criminal faction who controlled the Complexo), Tim Lopes was met by Elias Maluco. Once they pulled Lopes out of the car trunk he was recognized by one of the traffickers, Cl√°udio Orlando do Nascimento, known by the nickname Ratinho (Little Rat). (Lopes had filmed Ratinho on the street in the Grota the previous year while Ratinho was cleaning an automatic rifle; the footage was aired as part of the \\"Feir√£o das Drogas\\" report that got so much attention). Also present were other traffickers named Xuxa and Zeu. Elias Maluco and other traffickers then transported Lopes to a nearby hill within the Complexo called Pedra do Sapo (Rock of the Toad). The sides of the hill are densely packed with the type of brick shacks typical of favelas, but the geography at the top of the hill features a desolate, grassy plateau with scattered small trees and a rudimentary football field. For many years these hilltops were used by leaders of drug trafficking gangs as sanctuary from law enforcement; they now feature the stations of a gondola transport system connecting the Complexo, operational since July 2011. The Complexo do Alem√£o. The traffickers tied Lopes to a tree. Ratinho was convinced that this was the same \\"Tim Lopes\\" that did the television report in 2001, resulting in his arrest and interference with the gang's drug profits. For this he insisted that Lopes had to die. Lopes pleaded for his life, but he was told that he would die. One of the traffickers who was present, Frei, later told detectives that there were more than twenty people present at the scene,√öltimo acusado da morte de Tim Lopes √© condenado a nove anos  Jornal Correio do Brasil nine of whom participated in Lopes's murder. They burned Lopes's eyes with a cigarette. In a \\"macabre ritual\\" of violence, using a samurai or a \\"ninja\\"-type sword, Elias Maluco cut off Lopes's hands, arms, and legs while Lopes was still alive. The other traffickers, including Andr√© Capeta and Ratinho, also participated in the torture. Police were later told that there was blood on several of the traffickers that were gathered around. Lopes was placed within several tires, covered in diesel fuel, and set on fire. This process, which had become institutionalized among traffickers within Rio's most violent favelas at the time, was referred to as micro-ondasO DIA Online - Seis anos sem Tim Lopes (microwave oven). =Investigation= Detective Daniel Gomes learned through speaking to shopkeepers and others in Vila Cruzeiro that Lopes had arrived at the favela in the afternoon and was accosted by traffickers at around 8:00 pm. Before entering Vila Cruzeiro, Lopes had arranged to have someone wait in a car, outside of the favela, in order to give him a ride home. When the prearranged time to meet that night came and went, the driver continued to wait until midnight. At which point he contacted Rede Globo. And Globo subsequently waited 11 hours before contacting police. The chief detective in charge of the Tim Lopes case was Inspector Daniel Gomes of the 22¬™ DP of the bairro da Penha (the Penha neighborhood precinct). On Monday June 3, 2002 at 11:00 am, Gomes was sitting in his office at the police station when he was notified that an attorney from Rede Globo was there to see him. Accompanying him was the driver who had waited for Lopes outside the favela the night before. When Gomes started investigating in Vila Cruzeiro that Monday, the word on the street was electric, as residents spoke about a man who had been captured and beaten by traffickers. It was related that the traffickers had taken this man to the top of Vila Cruzeiro hill and incinerated him in the micro-ondas (microwave oven) constructed in a rock formation. Gomes was directed to the area and found burned tires, fresh blood, and human remains. It seemed to the police at the moment that Lopes's fate ended at that location, but through DNA testing they discovered that it was, in fact, not Lopes.Rio police detective Daniel Gomes looking over the area at the top of Pedra do Sapo hill where Tim Lopes was tied to a tree and tortured, and where charred bone fragments from Lopes were uncovered by Gomes and his team. The Pedra do Sapo favela is nearby, albeit not visible in this image. Days after Lopes's disappearance, two suspect traficantes (traffickers) were arrested by the 38¬™ DP-Br√°s de Pina Military Police in the Morro da Caixa D√Ågua (Water Box Hill), which is in Penha near Vila Cruzeiro. Both traffickers were part of Elias Maluco's gang. During interrogation, they went into detail and explained the entire course of events, stating that it was Elias Maluco who assassinated Tim Lopes. They described how Lopes was transported by car to the Grota in the Complexo do Alem√£o to meet Elias Maluco and others of the gang and how Lopes was recognized from television and made to suffer humiliation and torture and his body burned to destroy evidence. This led the detective, with substantial reinforcements, to diligently search the Grota and the Pedra do Sapo for Lopes's remains. Following an anonymous tip, on June 11, 2002, detectives discovered a secret grave site in a field near a rudimentary football field at the top of Pedra do Sapo hill. There they uncovered a few burned bone fragments of several individuals. Through DNA testing they were able to positively identify a small part of a rib bone belonging to Tim Lopes.Folha Online - Cotidiano - Corpo de Tim Lopes √© identificado por exame de DNA, diz pol√≠cia - 05/07/2002 Also found buried at the site were Lopes's wristwatch, his crucifix, and the micro-camera that he had been using that night. There was also what remained of a burned ninja sword. Inspector Daniel Gomes final police report was 658 pages in length. Gomes concluded in his investigation that Lopes had not filmed at the baile funk in Vila Cruzeiro that night. Gomes wrote that Lopes filmed traffickers dealing drugs and carrying guns that night. Lopes' boss at Globo said that Lopes was working on a story about sexual exploitation at the baile funk, with the understanding that Lopes would have tried to obtain footage at the baile funk had he not been accosted relatively early in the night. Gomes wrote that if Globo would have notified the police at midnight on June 2, there was still a chance that Lopes's life could have been saved through police interdiction. The Globo program Jornal Nacional subsequently televised a response, including an editorial by newscaster William Bonner criticizing Gomes's report. Jornal Nacional stated that Lopes's recorded footage was destroyed that night in the micro-ondas and that the community at Vila Cruzeiro had asked for Lopes help concerning minors being prostituted at the baile funk in their community. Jornal Nacional also stated that Tim Lopes was the behind-the-scene producer for 2001's \\"Feir√£o de Drogas\\", so his likeness would not necessarily have been well-known. Rio Governor Benedita da Silva subsequently took Gomes off of the case. On July 7, Lopes's remains were buried at the Jardim da Saudade cemetery in the Rio suburb of Sulacap. The funeral was attended by Rio Governor Benedita da Silva.Di√°rio Popular - Tim Lopes √© enterrado ao som de Can√ß√£o da Am√©rica Five years after Lopes's death, a teenager was arrested in southern Brazil who had been at the scene of Lopes's murder. Now going by the name Cinq√ºenta (Fifty), he was a 12-year-old boy in 2002 when he was told to buy diesel fuel and bring it to the top of the hill in order to set fire to Lopes. Upon his arrest in 2007, he gave a detailed account to police about that night and spoke to a group of journalists, adding to what had been previously said during the investigation. =Traffickers involved= The nine traffickers who were sought by police, and eventually stood trial and put behind bars were: Elias Pereira da Silva (Elias Maluco); Andr√© da Cruz Barbosa (Andr√© Capeta); Cl√°udio Orlando do Nascimento (Ratinho); Maur√≠cio de Lima Matias (Boizinho); Claudino dos Santos Coelho (Xuxa); Elizeu Fel√≠cio de Souza (Zeu); √Çngelo da Silva (Primo); Reinaldo Amaral de Jesus (Cad√™); and Fernando S√°tyro da Silva (Frei). (They are ordered in terms of the degree of their culpability in Lopes's torture and murder‚Äîwith Elias Maluco being the gang leader, and Andr√© Capeta being his right-hand man.) After an intensive and highly publicized 3¬Ω-month man-hunt, Elias Maluco was captured by police in the Favela da Grota on September 19, 2002. On May 25, 2005 he was given a prison sentence of 28¬Ω years.Elias Maluco as he was being presented to the media by the pol√≠cia civil, September 19, 2002. He had been apprehended in the Favela da Grota, Complexo do Alem√£o Of the group of traffickers involved who were subsequently pursued, three were killed by police, and others were sentenced to prison. After their incarceration, anger was expressed through Rio's media when two of the traffickers were paroled on work release at which point they fled. Both have since been recaptured. Among those convicted of Lopes's murder, Claudino dos Santos Coelho (Xuxa), and Cl√°udio Orlando do Nascimento (Ratinho - Little Rat) were each sentenced to 23 years and 6 months' incarceration. Ratinho took an active part in torturing Lopes and was strongly in favor of killing Lopes when they conducted a mock trial. Ratinho had been one of the traffickers featured in the \\"Big Drug Fair\\" report from the previous year, which had resulted in a period of police crackdowns. (In 2011 he was charged with assault while in prison after throwing boiling water on his girlfriend during a conjugal visit). Claudino dos Santos Coelho (known by the nicknames Xuxa and Russ√£o) escaped from the Bangu penitentiary in Rio's Zona Oeste (West Zone) in February 2013, along with 30 other prisoners by tunneling to a sewer. By September 2013 he was one of those leading a gang of sixty heavily armed bandits ensconced in the jungled hills above Rio (between Covanca and Lins de Vasconcelos) as a home base from which they preyed on neighborhoods. When the police special forces unit of BOPE mounted an operation against them in September 2013 he and another trafficker were killed in the ensuing gun battle along with a lieutenant of BOPE. Elizeu Fel√≠cio de Souza (Zeu) was responsible for setting fire to Lopes's body. In 2007 he was paroled, at which point he fled to the Complexo do Alem√£o, which was an area outside of police interference at that time. Zeu was later secretly filmed working as a drug trafficker in the Complexo do Alem√£o. It was only in 2010 when military and police units invaded the network of favelas in the Complexo that they discovered him hiding in a house in a part of the Complexo known as Coqueiro. He was taken into custody. The arrest was widely publicized and applauded in Rio's media. √Çngelo Ferreira da Silva (Primo), who was sentenced to nine years. After he had completed a sixth of his total sentence he was let out of prison on work release, at which point he fled. He was recaptured by police in the Rio suburb of Santa Cruz in May 2010. Other traffickers implicated in Lopes's torture and murder were Andr√© da Cruz Barbosa, or Andr√© Capeta (Andr√© the Devil), who cut Lopes's legs and ordered others to burn the body; Fl√°vio Reginaldo dos Santos (Buda); and Maur√≠cio de Lima Matias (Boizinho), who were all killed in confrontations with police. =Aftermath= Though a prominent journalist, Tim Lopes only became nationally known after his death in a crime that shocked the country. The television program Jornal Nacional pursued the story, which increased the pressure on the authorities to capture the criminals involved; and O Globo newspaper and TV began using the term poder paralelo (parallel power) to describe the paradigm of that time of criminal gangs controlling certain favelas within Rio with impunity.This paragraph translated from Portuguese Wikipedia article on Tim LopesGenoinoCanal da Imprensa Rio journalist Jorge Antonio Barros, who has been writing about Rio's favelas and the crime beat since the 1980s and was a colleague of Lopes at Globo, wrote that Lopes's death served to snap him out of the dream state, to which people sometimes fall prey, of romanticizing \\"the malandro;\\" and that his death reminded people who don't have to live in favelas under the \\"law of the trafficker\\" of the terror that exists as a daily reality. Another colleague of Lopes at Globo was journalist C√©sar Seabra, who wrote: \\"The death of Tim Lopes opened our eyes to a new reality. Now our dilemma is to figure out how to report stories from the areas controlled by drug dealers.\\" Seabra wrote in response to Lopes's death that the culture of crime reporting at that time needed to change: \\"We're tired of giving the criminals the front page. We're tired of interviewing the criminal on TV. We're tired of empowering the criminal in order to get an exclusive.\\" \\"The reflections about journalism generated by Lopes's killing led to the creation of the Brazilian Association of Investigative Journalism (Abraji in Portuguese) in December of that year\\". Tim Lopes was honored in a S√£o Paulo carnaval (carnival) procession in 2003 by the samba school, Acad√™micos do Tucuruvi, with the theme \\"Do not shut my voice,\\" a tribute to a free press, with lyrics such as, \\"the truth Tim-Tim by Tim-Tim,\\" in reference to his nickname.SASP - Tucuruvi, Carnaval 2003 A street has since been named after Tim Lopes in Rio's west suburb of Barra da Tijuca. It is called Avenida Tim Lopes. The change was lobbied by the Sindicato dos Jornalistas Profissionais do Munic√≠pio do Rio (Union of Professional Journalists of the City of Rio). When a new public high school was built in the Complexo do Alem√£o, it was named Col√©gio Tim Lopes. From time to time, on the anniversary of Lopes's death, students have artistic performances and other expressions to memorialize Lopes. Police invades Vila Cruzeiro and the Complexo On November 25, 2010, Rio's special forces battalion (BOPE), supported by other police units, entered Vila Cruzeiro in Penha via Brazilian Marine armored transport to various points within the slum and ultimately took control of the hill and the surrounding area of Penha. This action was in response to attacks throughout Rio by the criminal faction headquartered there. Military and civil police units (which included CORE, Batalh√£o de Choque, Federal Police, among others) then took over the territory of the network of favelas comprising the Complexo do Alem√£o with support from the Brazilian Armed Forces. Thousands of soldiers of the Brazilian military were stationed throughout these communities during the subsequent two years. During the 2010 Rio de Janeiro security crisis, after BOPE reached strategic points at the top of Vila Cruzeiro hill via tanks driven by Brazilian Marines, Rio's media showed live aerial footage of a multitude of criminals frantically fleeing on foot over the dirt back roads that exited into the Complexo do Alem√£o. This was the same route that the kidnapped Tim Lopes traveled in a car trunk when he was being transported from Vila Cruzeiro to the Complexo do Alem√£o. Several Brazilian journalists visited these favelas in the days after the security forces took control and discussed what the changes meant. (During a time period after Tim Lopes's death, when journalists would enter favelas housing criminal factions associated with the traffickers who killed Lopes, they would sometimes hear \\"vai ter mais Tim, vai ter mais Tim!\\" (There will be more Tims!) as a warning insinuating that more reporters could be killed.) UPPs established In June 2012, ten years after Tim Lopes's death, the Complexo do Alem√£o began to be under the umbrella of eight new Pacifying Police Units (UPPs) at the predetermined conclusion of the military's presence. The UPPs cover the areas of the Complexo do Alem√£o (which comprises 13 favelas) and Penha. Just the Complexo itself is policed by 1,200 UPP officers (it was announced in July 2012 that the number would be increased to 1,800). One of the UPPs within the Complexo covers the area of the Pedra do Sapo, which is the hill and upper field where an anonymous tip led detectives to discover a clandestine cemetery which contained some fragments of Lopes's bones and some of his personal effects. In December 2010, a mass was held to commemorate Lopes in a church in the Complexo called the Igreja Nossa Senhora de Guadalupe. Lopes's 87-year-old mother, Maria do Carmo do Nascimento, was in attendance. The service was organized by Rio's municipal union for journalists, the Sindicato dos Jornalistas do Munic√≠pio do Rio de Janeiro. In January 2011, during the inauguration ceremony marking his reelection, Rio de Janeiro State Governor S√©rgio Cabral mentioned Tim Lopes in his inaugural speech. Cabral stated that Tim Lopes's memory had been honored by Rio's government when the press room and a public high school were named after Lopes. A Gondola lift/cable car built by the Leitner-Poma group now spans the Complexo do Alem√£o allowing residents a faster commute.http://gondolaproject.com/2010/10/13/the-complexo-do-alemao- teleferico/ It is now possible for residents of remote hills within the Complexo to take a gondola across the stretches of favela and arrive at a point where they can catch a train going to other parts of Rio de Janeiro. Documentary films Tim Lopes's son, Bruno Quintella (who was 19 when his father was killed), completed a university degree in journalism in 2010. In 2011 he began filming a biographical documentary film about the life of his father to show a broader perspective, not just the details of his death. In May 2012, 29-year-old Quintella visited Vila Cruzeiro, and also Pedro do Sapo in the Complexo do Alem√£o, the location of the clandestine cemetery that had held his father's remains. His visit coincided with the establishment of a permanent community police presence, as new UPPs were inaugurated in the area. The title of the film is \\"Hist√≥rias de Arcanjo: um document√°rio sobre Tim Lopes,\\" (Stories of Archangel: a documentary about Tim Lopes); Arcanjo being Tim Lopes's first name. In 2011 it was announced that Brazilian film director Jos√© Padilha, who is best known for his Elite Squad films (and who directed the remake of the 1987 urban sci-fi action film, RoboCop) is directing a documentary about the 2010 invasion of Vila Cruzeiro and the Complexo do Alem√£o by Rio's police and the Brazilian military. It's been reported that the documentary begins with an opening scene recounting the torture of Tim Lopes. Posthumous human rights award Tim Lopes was posthumously awarded Brazil's top human rights prize, the Pr√™mio Direitos Humanos, on December 17, 2012, among other recipients. The award was presented by Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff to Lopes's sister T√¢nia Lopes at Itamaraty in Bras√≠lia. President Dilma expressed that the award honors \\"individuals fighters\\" who \\"risk their lives in defense of human rights.\\"  See also  * Necklacing  References  Further reading * Percival de Souza (2002).

Rees, 553 U.S. 35 (2008), is a decision by the United States Supreme Court, which upheld the constitutionality of a particular method of lethal injection used for capital punishment. Background of the case Ralph Baze and Thomas Bowling were sentenced to death in Kentucky, each for a double- murder. They argued that executing them by lethal injection would violate the Eighth Amendment prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment. The governing legal standard required that lethal injection must not inflict \\"unnecessary pain\\", and Baze and Bowling argued that the lethal chemicals Kentucky used carried an unnecessary risk of inflicting pain during the execution. Kentucky at the time used the then-common combination of sodium thiopental, pancuronium bromide, and potassium chloride. The Supreme Court of Kentucky rejected their claim, but the U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari. The case had nationwide implications because the specific \\"cocktail\\" used for lethal injections in Kentucky was the same one that virtually all states used for lethal injection. The U.S. Supreme Court stayed all executions in the country between September 2007 and April 2008, when it delivered its ruling and affirmed the Kentucky top court decision. It is the longest period with zero executions in the United States from 1982 to date.Lethal injection moratorium inches closer Supreme Court's decision The Supreme Court upheld Kentucky's method of lethal injection as constitutional by a vote of 7‚Äì2. No single opinion carried a majority. Chief Justice Roberts wrote a plurality opinion joined by Justice Kennedy and Justice Alito, that was later ruled to be the controlling opinion in Glossip v. Gross (2015).. Justice Alito wrote an opinion concurring with the plurality reasoning, while Justices Stevens, Scalia, Thomas and Breyer wrote opinions concurring in the judgment only. Justice Ginsburg, joined by Justice Souter, wrote the lone dissent. =Plurality opinion= The plurality opinion was written by Chief Justice John Roberts and joined by Justices Anthony Kennedy and Samuel Alito, held that Kentucky's execution method was humane and constitutional. In response to the petitioners' argument that the risk of mistakes in the execution protocol was so great as to render it unconstitutional, the plurality wrote that \\"an isolated mishap alone does not violate the Eighth Amendment\\". It also stated that the first drug in a multi- drug cocktail must render the inmate unconscious. Otherwise, there is a \\"substantial, constitutionally unacceptable risk\\" that the inmate will suffer a painful suffocation.http://www.scotusblog.com/wp- content/uploads/2008/04/07-5439.pdf =Stevens' concurrence= Justice John Paul Stevens concurred in the opinion of the Court, writing separately to explain his concerns with the death penalty in general.https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/07-5439.ZC1.htmlhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/files/43-3_Semel.pdf He wrote that the case questioned the \\"justification for the death penalty itself\\". He characterized the motivation behind the death penalty as an antithesis to modern values: > We are left, then, with retribution as the primary rationale for imposing > the death penalty. And indeed, it is the retribution rationale that animates > much of the remaining enthusiasm for the death penalty. As Lord Justice > Denning argued in 1950, \\" 'some crimes are so outrageous that society > insists on adequate punishment, because the wrong-doer deserves it, > irrespective of whether it is a deterrent or not.' \\" See Gregg, 428 U. S., > at 184, n. 30. Our Eighth Amendment jurisprudence has narrowed the class of > offenders eligible for the death penalty to include only those who have > committed outrageous crimes defined by specific aggravating factors. It is > the cruel treatment of victims that provides the most persuasive arguments > for prosecutors seeking the death penalty. A natural response to such > heinous crimes is a thirst for vengeance. He further stressed concern over the process of death penalty cases where emotion plays a major role and where the safeguards for defendants may have been lowered. He cited statistics that indicated that many people sentenced to die were later found to be wrongly convicted. He concluded by stating that a penalty \\"with such negligible returns to the State [is] patently excessive and cruel and unusual punishment violative of the Eighth Amendment\\". None of the other eight members of the Court choose to join Justice Stevens's opinion. =Scalia's concurrence= Justice Scalia, joined by Justice Thomas, wrote separately \\"to provide what I think is needed response to Justice Stevens' separate opinion\\": > In the fact of Justice Stevens' experience, the experience of all others is, > it appears, of little consequence. The experience of the state legislatures > and the Congress‚Äîwho retain the death penalty as a form of punishment‚Äîis > dismissed as \\"the product of habit and inattention rather than an acceptable > deliberative process\\". The experience of social scientists whose studies > indicate that the death penalty deters crime is relegated to a footnote. The > experience of fellow citizens who support the death penalty is described, > with only the most thinly veiled condemnation, as stemming from a \\"thirst > for vengeance\\". It is Justice Stevens' experience that reigns over all. > Justice Stevens' final refuge in his cost-benefit analysis is a familiar > one: There is a risk that an innocent person might be convicted and > sentenced to death‚Äîthough not a risk that Justice Stevens can quantify, > because he lacks a single example of a person executed for a crime he did > not commit in the current American system.

Hasenstein was a prot√©g√© of Milton Resnick, who was artist-in- residence at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison while he was doing graduate work.  Early life and education  Born and raised in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, Hasenstein grew to favor nature's icons; bones and branches and other found objects which play a predominant role in his art. Hasenstein gives sculptural form to the materials he uses from nature. His sculptures are very organic, made from materials found on walks, hikes and adventures. While at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, Hasenstein developed a painting style that is often referred to as Abstract Impressionism, reflecting Monet's late French Impressionistic influence as well as his mentor Resnick's Post Abstract Expressionism.  Career  Rudolf Arnheim author of Art and Visual Perception: A Psychology of the Creative Eye was also a friend and mentor of Hasenstein. In 2007, Hasenstein was featured in the SPNN cable special Lowertown TV. Hasenstein is currently represented by Finn's Gallery at 308 N. Arizona in Silver City, New Mexico. After residing in the Lowertown Lofts, a community of artists in St. Paul, Minnesota for several years, he relocated to Silver City in summer 2008.

It was designed and released by Psygnosis on November 17, 1998. The game was sponsored by shoe company Vans. Plot The evil Krakken has appeared and causes a rampage at the local \\"hoverdek\\" park, where \\"dekkers\\" Xako, Mia, and their friends practice their skills. Using his powers, Krakken kidnaps the \\"dek kids\\" and magically transforms them into his minions all to make the place his new home. Now it is up to Xako and Mia to save their friends and stop Krakken's evil, sending him back to where he came from. Gameplay The player warps to different worlds, known as time zones from a hub area. Each world is broken down into levels which consist of courses that the player must travel through on their hoverboard. In order to properly complete each world, the player must collect a certain number of stars, obtained along the course or by stomping on the heads of enemies. At the end of each world, the player faces a guardian which lies in wait at the end of the level. Some levels feature a shooting gallery format. Here the player character is positioned in the center and fires a weapon within a time limit. Player characters have no weapons by default, and must pick them up from drop boxes scattered through the levels. Development Psybadek was developed by Psygnosis at its Liverpool Headquarters. The game was designed by Graham Sidwell, and Nick Burcombe was the project lead. Programmer Stephen Balmer came up with the game's original concept of the player free-roaming across landscapes on a board, while concept designer Mick Harrison drew images of characters on hoverboards. According to Sidwell, the game was in development for both the PlayStation and PC, but the latter was scrapped because it \\"diluted\\" the design team's focus. Sidwell explained that creating Psybadek involved much trial-and-error, mainly due to the difficulty of melding traditional platform genre obstacles with sports- related \\"momentum\\". Sidwell emphasized the difference between Psybadek and other boarding games. \\"There's obviously the snowboarding feel to this game,\\" he stated, \\"But unlike most games in which you're racing against the clock and performing tricks on the way down for points, in Psybadek, those tricks actually do something. The stunts themselves are weapons.\\" Psybadek was officially announced in May 1997, with a tentative release for the last quarter of that year. However, the entire development team was temporarily pulled away from the project in order to work on other Psygnosis games. After their releases, the developer continued work on Psybadek, attempting to improve its character motions, touch up its 3D environments, and expand the number of levels. Like many other Psygnosis titles at the time, Psybadek was created using Softimage 3D. Psygnosis partnered with California-based apparel company Vans to sponsor the game. Psybadeks in-game characters feature Vans clothing in exchange for the game's promotion at the Triple Crown series and the Warped Tour. The characters were designed to have a cute yet cool manga- style look. Reception The game received unfavorable reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. Next Generation said, \\"As a concept, Psybadek has been dangled in front of gamers for quite a while and created at least some excitement. It's a shame that because of bad designs, controls, and graphics, the potential was never realized.\\" GameRevolution listed Psybadek as eighth on their list of the 50 Worst Game Names Ever.

At a traditional cable television headend, multitudes of satellite dishes and antennas are used to grab cable stations from dozens of communication satellites. In contrast, Managed Satellite Distribution (fka HITS) combines cable stations into multiplex signals on just a few satellites; cable television companies can then pull in hundreds of channels at the local headend with relatively little equipment; the HITS feed effectively replaces the more complex traditional headend operations. Managed Satellite Distribution (fka HITS) was founded in 1994 and its namesake product is commonly recognized as the pioneer of digital television in the United States. Managed Satellite Distribution (fka HITS) was launched by TCI before their later 1999 purchase by the old AT&T;, then merged with the smaller Comcast in 2002 as part their purchase of AT&T; Broadband (formerly TCI).

Early life Born around 1597, he was the natural son of Charles Blount, Earl of Devonshire and his lover and future wife, Penelope Devereux, and was born while his parents were living together without benefit of marriage. After his mother obtained a divorce from her first husband Robert Rich, 1st Earl of Warwick, in 1605, his parents married and although they were unable to legitimise him, his father, who died shortly after the marriage, left him a large estate. His mother died the following year. He became a member of James I's court, where he was something of a royal favourite, who played in a masque before the king mounted by James Hay, 1st Viscount Doncaster (later Earl of Carlisle) at Essex House on 8 January 1620/1621.The masque, played before the King to celebrate the arrival of the French ambassador, has been rediscovered; see Timothy Raylor, \\"The Lost Essex House Masque (1621): A Manuscript Text Discovered,\\". English Manuscript Studies 1100‚Äì1700 7 (1998): 86‚Äì130, and \\"The Design and Authorship of The Essex House Masque (1621)\\", MRDE 10 (1998), p. 218. He was among the entourage of the Earl of Carlisle, who were employed to offer excuses at the court of Louis XIII, for the passage of Prince Charles through Paris incognito on his way to Spain at the time of negotiations towards the ill-starred \\"Spanish Match\\". Earl of Newport In July 1627, he was created Earl of Newport in the Isle of Wight; Newport, as he now was, took part in the Siege of Saint-Martin-de-R√© in 1627 but was captured at the battle of the pont du Feneau on 8 November. He was however released soon after. He held a rear- admiral's command in the ineffective expedition to relieve La Rochelle in August 1628, for which he was petitioning for payment in the following years. His appointment as Master of Ordnance for his lifetime was granted 31 August 1634; as was expected in the seventeenth century, he derived a tidy fortune from the position. From his sale of gunpowder at exorbitant prices, through the Spanish ambassador, to supply the Spanish fleet attacking Dutch forces in September 1639, he pocketed ¬£1000, and the King, ¬£5000. By his own account he bargained with the ambassador to land soldiers from the Spanish fleet at Dunkirk, at thirty shillings a head, though public neutrality had been enjoined by Charles. His relatives, the Rich-Devereux clan, were identified with the Parliamentary opposition on the 1630s. Although at Christmas 1639, Newport participated with the King in the extravagant masque on the theme of Philogenes, royal \\"lover of the People\\",Woodward 1955:310; almost the last of the masques, its words were by Sir William Davenant, its sets and costumes by Inigo Jones. with the return of the Long Parliament the next year, Newport by degrees joined the forces of opposition in the House of Lords. The turning point came during the trial of Strafford in 1641, when Col. Lord Goring had revealed to Newport an amateurish plot of Royalist officers at Portsmouth to take London by surprise, seize the Tower and somehow rescue the king. Goring betrayed the plot to Newport, who passed on the information to John Pym, who brought it forward at the most dramatic and opportune moment, sealing Strafford's fate in the bill of attainder. When the Civil War broke out, however, Newport served in the royalist army, and took part in the second battle of Newbury in 1644. In January 1646 he was taken prisoner and confined in London on parole. He played little part in public affairs thereafter. At the Restoration of Charles II he regained some of his old influence, but age and ill health were taking their toll. Personal life He had on 7 February 1626 married Anne Boteler, daughter of John Boteler, 1st Baron Boteler of Bramfield and Elizabeth Villiers, half-sister of George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, by whom he had eight children:Accounts of his sons in peerage references tend to be inconsistent in both names and dates.

He was part of 2-VLG-V, which was stationed in Singapore before its withdrawal to Java. His unit emblem was a rhinoceros head painted on both sides of the front fuselage on his Brewster Buffalo aircraft. His rank and surname, 'Lt Deibel' was printed beside the nose art. Deibel is credited with three kills, two of which were Ki-27 Nates on 12 January, during a Japanese air raid over Singapore, and was twice wounded in action on 12 January and 19 February 1942. Deibel was killed on 12 June 1951, piloting a Gloster Meteor aircraft when it crashed near Uithuizen in the Netherlands. World War II =Singapore= Deibel arrived in Singapore with his squadron on 9 December 1941 with 9-12 Brewster Buffaloes and was stationed at Kallang Airfield. He first saw action on 12 January 1942 during a Japanese air raid over Singapore. A formation of Japanese bombers escorted by five Ki-27 Nates were sighted at 1000 hours. They were intercepted by three Dutch Buffaloes, who succeeded in chasing them away, damaging one of the bombers. When they returned in the afternoon, Deibel and two other pilots were scrambled to intercept them, encountering nine Ki-27s. Deibel claimed two of them before being shot down himself. He was hospitalised for four days after suffering a wounded head. His squadron returned to Java on 18 January, missing out on the Battle of Singapore. Deibel followed eight Buffaloes to Semplak, while 23 others flew to Andir and Tjilitian.Brewster Buffalo: in Dutch service Emblem of unit 2-VLG-V. The unit Deibel belonged to. =Dutch East Indies= When a formation of 35 Japanese aircraft attacked Semplak on 19 February, eight Buffaloes (including Deibel) engaged them. Deibel managed to fire twice at an A6M Zero, but was wounded by a 20 mm shell ten minutes later, forcing him to land. 11 Japanese planes were shot down, with the Dutch losing four Buffaloes and two pilots. The raid destroyed three RAF Lockheed Hudsons and two KNILM Sikorskys. On 7 March, Japanese troops had reached the plateau of Lembang. Deibel, along with Lieutenant Gerard Bruggink and Officer Cadet Jan Scheffer, volunteered to join Captain Jacob van Helsdingen on his mission using the last three working Buffalo aircraft. The four pilots took off from Andir airfield and proceeded to Lembang to provide air support for ground troops fighting in the city. Van Helsdingen's squadron travelled 200 metres when they encountered a Japanese aircraft, which Deibel attacked before it escaped. Some time later, three Japanese A6M Zeros appeared. Deibel fired at two of them which turned away, but was hit in the oil tank by the third Zero and had to break off from combat. His wingman, Scheffer, escorted him back to Andir airfield under a tropical rainstorm, shooting down a Nakajima Ki-43 fighter. One of Deibel's landing gears, damaged during the fight, broke off from his aircraft, causing it to crash in a ground loop. He survived without sustaining any injuries. Van Helsdingen and Bruggink remained above Lembang, but were now dogfighting six Zeroes. Van Helsdingen was soon shot down, but Bruggink managed to escape into the clouds before returning to Andir airfield. Dutch forces in Lembang surrendered the next day. All four Dutch pilots were awarded the Military William Order on 14 July 1948. See also *Jacob van Helsdingen *Gerard Bruggink References ;Bibliography *Stenman, Kari and Andrew Thomas.

It was adopted as a religious symbol in Indian religions such as Shaivism and Vajrayana Buddhism. The khatvƒÅ·πÖga was adopted by some lineages of historical tantra though it preceded such traditions. History In Hinduism, Shiva- Rudra carried the khatvƒÅ·πÖga as a staff weapon and are thus referred to as khatvƒÅ·πÖgƒ´s. Beer (2003: p. 102) relates how the symbolism of the khatvƒÅ·πÖga in Vajrayana, particularly the Nyingma school founded by Padmasambhava, was a direct borrowing from the Shaiva Kapalikas, who frequented places of austerity such as charnel grounds and crossroads as a form of \\"left-handed path\\" (vamachara) sƒÅdhanƒÅ. Author A. V. Narasimha Murthy says, \\"In classical literature the weapon Khatvanga is mentioned in works like MƒÅlatƒ´mƒÅdhava of Bhavabhuti and ≈öiva Stutƒ´ of Narayana Panditacharya\\". Fabrication Originally, the khatvƒÅ·πÖga was made of bones, especially, the long bones of forearm or the leg of human beings or animals. Later, wood and metal were used. The khatvƒÅ·πÖga is a long club with skulls engraved on the body. A khatvƒÅ·πÖga represents the vajra. Vajrayana In the Buddhist lore, it is also a particular divine attribute of Padmasambhava and endemic to his iconographic representation and depicted as an accoutrement of his divine consorts, Mandarava and Yeshe Tsogyal. In the twilight language, it represents Yab-Yum. The weapon's three severed heads denotes moksha from the three worlds (Trailokya); it has a rainbow sash representing the Five Pure Lights of the mahƒÅbh≈´ta.

Federico Agnelli (1626‚Äì1702) was an Italian intaglio printer, engraver and typographer, active in Milan. He was chiefly employed in portraits, though he occasionally engraved emblematical and architectural subjects. He engraved with the architect Carlo Butio a set of plates representing the Cathedral at Milan.Cf. the article by Anita Mondolfo, \\"Agnelli, Federico'\\", in Dizionario biografico degli italiani, vol. I, Roma, 1960, pp. 417-18. Biography He was the founder of the Milanese typography, that was called after his family name and his descendants held this shop in Santa Margherita for almost three centuries. It is considered that he first dedicated himself to portraiture, he executed, among other things, engraved portraits of the emperors Ferdinand II and Ferdinand III and of Pope Innocent XI. Then his company turned to views of Milan and especially of the cathedral, and the reproduction of monuments and aspects of the city was the constant care of the company. But he also took care of Rome. Federico was also an engraver, whose work was not always easily differentiated from that of his relatives; and often the engravings were simply signed \\"Agnelli\\" or \\"Agnellus\\". The engraving activity actually prevailed over the strictly editorial one: here we should mention the printing of The Lent of Fr. P. Segneri and The Sermons of Fr. Pasquale Carafa. For the production of religious works he had the protection of ecclesiastical authority, and on 11 May 1694 Brother Innocenzo, prior of the Certosa di Pavia and Minister General of the Carthusians, declared him, together with his wife and children, the meritorious of the Order.

Lange and his endorsement of a planned economy, it was included among the twelve essays in Hayek's 1948 compendium Individualism and Economic Order.  Argument  Hayek's article argues against the establishment of a Central Pricing Board (advocated by Lange) by highlighting the dynamic and organic nature of market price-fluctuations, and the benefits of this phenomenon. He asserts that a centrally planned economy could never match the efficiency of the open market because what is known by a single agent is only a small fraction of the sum total of knowledge held by all members of society. A decentralized economy thus complements the dispersed nature of information spread throughout society. In Hayek's words, \\"The marvel is that in a case like that of a scarcity of one raw material, without an order being issued, without more than perhaps a handful of people knowing the cause, tens of thousands of people whose identity could not be ascertained by months of investigation, are made to use the material or its products more sparingly; that is, they move in the right direction.\\" The article also discusses the concepts of 'individual equilibrium' and of Hayek's notion of the divide between information which is useful and practicable versus that which is purely scientific or theoretical.  Reception  \\"The Use of Knowledge in Society\\" was a sensation among economists, setting off a train of work in the economics of information and other areas, including the work of a number of future Nobel Prize winners, as noted by Nobel winner Leonid Hurwicz. UCLA economist Armen Alchian remembers the excitement of reading Hayek's essay and stopping fellow economists in the hallway to ask if they had read Hayek's essay. In 2011 \\"The Use of Knowledge in Society\\" was selected as one of the top 20 articles published in the American Economic Review during its first 100 years.  Influence  Jimmy Wales cites \\"The Use of Knowledge in Society\\", which he read as an undergraduate, as \\"central\\" to his thinking about \\"how to manage the Wikipedia project\\". Hayek argued that information is decentralized ‚Äì that knowledge is unevenly dispersed among different members of society ‚Äì and that as a result, decisions are best made by those with local knowledge rather than by a central authority.

The book was published on July 1, 1999 by Grand Central Publishing. Plot synopsis Anthropologist Nora Kelly finds a letter that was written sixteen years ago, but mysteriously sent to her only recently. The letter is written by her father, long believed dead. The letter states that he had found the lost city of gold, Quivira. Kelly organizes an expedition into a harsh, remote corner of Utah's canyon country. A portion of the team learns that the city of Quivira held not gold, but micaceous, golden colored pottery, and that it also was a center for an Aztec death cult, which had enslaved the native Anasazi people. The Aztec rulers used black magic, aided by a powder of the fungus Coccidioides immitis which could kill by causing coccidioidomycosis. Kelly's teammate, Sloane, attempts to kill Kelly to be the sole person who can claim the find, not suspecting what Kelly has learned about the fungal infection, and neither parties realizing until very late that they are being tracked by contemporary practitioners of the cult, who have enhanced their ability to stalk and fight with traditional hallucinogens such as psilocybin, mescaline, and datura.  Background  The character of Nora Kelly is modeled on the amateur archaeologist and writer Nora Benjamin Kubie, grandmother of Lincoln Child.  Continuity  Bill Smithback, the journalist hired to chronicle the expedition, previously appeared in Preston and Child's Aloysius Pendergast series, and is revealed to have achieved some level of fame based on his novelization of the events depicted in Relic and Reliquary. Nora Kelly later appears as a supporting character in the Pendergast series, starting with The Cabinet of Curiosities in 2002, and her final appearance being in Cemetery Dance in 2009. Then gets her own novel series starting with Old Bones in 2019.

Her case was reported on throughout the United States, and the Associated Press wrote that the incident \\"sparked a national debate about vigilantism\\". She shot and killed her son's accused molester in a Jamestown, California courtroom during the preliminary hearing on the charges against him. She served three years of a 10-year sentence and was released after an appeal based on jury misconduct. She sparked a significant national debate, and a made for TV movie about vigilantism. Rather than opting for a retrial, she pleaded guilty to a lesser charge and was paroled with time served. She later went back to prison after a conviction on drug charges, for which she served more than three years. During her first term in prison, she developed breast cancer, which ultimately caused her death in 2008 at the age of 56. Killing of Driver Nesler made headlines in 1993 when she killed, on April 2, Daniel Mark Driver, who had been accused of child molestation after his abuse of five boys (including her then-six-year-old son, William), in the courtroom of the Jamestown Justice Court. Driver had previous convictions for child molestation. According to Jon Thurber of the Los Angeles Times, the finding that Nesler, when she killed Driver, had methamphetamines significantly influencing her body caused the \\"sympathetic portrait\\" of herself portrayed by her defense team to \\"erode\\". She fired five shots into Driver's head, killing him instantly. In 2002, she was convicted of selling and possessing methamphetamine. She was released from a woman's facility near Chowchilla, California in 2006. The television film Judgment Day: The Ellie Nesler Story was based upon the incident. Nesler died at age 56 at the UC Davis Medical Center.

Etymology The first element of its name is ban (Thai: ‡∏ö‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ô) means 'village'.Thai/English Dictionary The second element, grong (Thai: ‡πÇ‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏á) is an onomatopoeia for the sound of a gong, analogous to the word 'gong' in English. The third element, greng (Thai: ‡πÄ‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏á), means 'dread'. Loosely translated, Ban Grong Greng means 'village of the dreaded gong'. This is because a gong is beaten during funeral processions at the village's temple in accordance with the local custom. The name Grong Greng is an example of an alliteration. Geography Ban Grong Greng is near the center of Nakhon Pa Mak on a canal which meets the Wang Thong River at Ban Sam Ruen. This canal comes to a fork at Ban Grong Greng where another canal leads to Ban Dongphayom and beyond.Google Earth Ban Grong Greng lies in the Nan Basin, which is part of the Chao Phraya Watershed.

Funerals at Wat Grong Greng involve a procession around the temple, chanting, meditation, and cremation of the deceased's body. Prior to a funeral at Grong Greng, families typically hold a wake in the deceased's home where family, friends and neighbors can pay their respects to the deceased. Items brought to the wake, such as flower arrangements, photographs of the deceased, and mementos from the deceased's life are carried in the funeral procession. Black clothing is customarily worn by those in mourning, if available. Religious activities and ceremonies other than funerals are typically held at nearby Wat Sam Ruen in Ban Sam Ruen. =Architecture= The style of the chedi at Wat Grung See Jayrin is influenced by earlier Thai pagodas, such as those found in the ruins of Ayutthaya. This style was imported from Sri Lanka during the rule of King Ramkhamhaeng the Great along with Theravada Buddhism. Later, King Ramathibodi I went on to make Theravada Buddhism the official religion of the kingdom of Ayutthaya.Thailand - History The ceremonial funeral chants at Wat Grong Greng are in Pali, the language of prayer of the Ceylonese Buddhist monastic community, members of which Ramkhamhaeng imported from Sri Lanka to teach Theravada Buddhism to his subjects in Thailand.

Agostino Aglio (December 15, 1777 ‚Äì January 30, 1857) was an Italian painter, decorator, and engraver. He was born at Cremona. He initially studied at the Brera Academy under Giocondo Albertolli, and then traveled to Rome to work under Campovecchio Mantovano.Graselli, page 13. In 1803 he came to England to assist William Wilkins, the well-known architect, in the production of his Antiquities of Magna Graecia which was published in 1807. For many years Aglio was employed in the decoration of theaters, churches, and country mansions both in England and Ireland. In 1819, he was employed, along with the architect Giovanni Battista Comolli, in painting vast frescoes for the Roman Catholic Church of St Mary Moorfields, London. Between the years 1820 and 1830, he published several books on art including a Collection of Capitals and Friezes drawn from the Antique and Antiquities of Mexico illustrated with over 1000 plates, drawn from the originals. He also painted a portrait of Queen Victoria, which was engraved. A street in modern-day Cremona is named after the artist.

Biography He was born at Sassoferrato. He probably started by working in the ceramics factory of his father. He may well have travelled to Venice in 1497 because his first known work, of the Enthroned Virgin between Saints Peter and Sebastian, shows clear Venetian influence. It can now be found in the Museo Civico in Padua. He may also have become a pupil of Carlo Crivelli, a well-known Venetian artist who moved to and spent much of his career in the Marche. Agabiti had returned to the Marche by 1502 and in 1507 was resident in Jesi. He is documented in his native town of Sassoferrato from 1510 onwards, producing altarpieces for local churches. Several can still be found in the churches for which they were painted but others are now in the Museo Civico in Sassoferrato, in the Pinacoteca Civica in Jesi or in private collections. He has always been seen as a minor, regional artist and few of his works are to be found in foreign collections. Exceptions include a Nativity now in the Christian Museum (Hungary) in Esztergom. The Italian Wikipedia entry for Agabiti contains a list of 19 extant paintings by him, giving their present whereabouts, although this is acknowledged to be an incomplete list. Among the artists generally credited with having influenced his style are the Venetians Cima da Conegliano and Alvise Vivarini, the Bolognese artist Francesco Francia and Marco Palmezzano of Forl√¨. However, Agabiti did not keep up with the changes of style occurring in the early sixteenth century, remaining attached to the more formal style of the fifteenth century. In 1531, he retired to the Convento dell‚ÄôEremita, Cupramontana, another town in the Marche region, where he died approximately nine years later.

Nordmende was historically renowned as a major consumer electronics brand for high quality televisions and domestic appliances. The brand is now manufactured and distributed under licence in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Turkey and Italy.  History  The original company, Radio N. Mende GmbH, was founded in 1923 by Otto Hermann Mende (1885-1940) in Dresden. Following the destruction of the plant during the bombing raids in 1945, Martin Mende (the founder's son) created a new company in Bremen in 1947, in a former Focke-Wulf plant, under the name Norddeutsche Mende-Rundfunk GmbH. The name was subsequently changed to Nordmende: subsequently the company became one of the prominent German manufacturers of radios, televisions, tape recorders and record players in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1969, Mende's sons took over the company, and in 1977 a majority shareholding was sold to the French Thomson Brandt company. The following year, the family sold their remaining shares to Thomson. In the 1980s, the factories in Bremen were closed, Nordmende becoming purely a Thomson trademark. At the same time, the Nordmende brand name was relaunched in Ireland in 2008 by the KAL Group. Although Nordmende was well known for its televisions throughout Ireland during the 1970s and 1980s, the company bought the rights to the name and launched a range of white goods including fridges, freezers, washing machines, and dishwashers, alongside a revamped range of flat-screen TVs and stereos. On January 27, 2010, the Thomson company changed its name to Technicolor SA, re- branding the entire company after its American film technology subsidiary, the leading provider of services and products for the Media & Entertainment industry. Nowadays Technicolor is the global owner of the Nordmende brand (except in Ireland) and licences the brand to selected Consumer Electronics partners in Turkey, in Italy and in the UK.

It was one of the first designer steroids to be marketed as a performance-enhancing drug to athletes and bodybuilders. Desoxymethyltestosterone is sometimes abbreviated as DMT, though it should not be confused with the hallucinogen dimethyltryptamine, which is also known by the same acronym. Side effects Pharmacology =Pharmacodynamics= In animal studies, desoxymethyltestosterone has been found to bind to the androgen receptor (AR) about half as strongly as DHT, and to cause side effects that are typical of 17Œ±-alkylated AAS, such as liver damage and left ventricular hypertrophy when taken in higher doses. Desoxymethyltestosterone is unusual in that it is structurally a 2-ene compound, lacking the 3-keto group present in almost all commercial AAS (with ethylestrenol being a rare and notable exception). This does not mean it is a weak compound, and clinical research has determined that it is a fairly potent oral agent. Rat studies indicate that desoxymethyltestosterone has an anabolic effect 160% that of testosterone while being only 60% as androgenic, giving it a Q ratio of 6.5:1. Because of this favorable ratio, experiments in orchiectomized rats have demonstrated that treatment with desoxymethyltestosterone resulted only in a stimulation of the weight of the levator ani muscle; the prostate and seminal vesicle weights remained unaffected leading the authors of one study to characterize desoxymethyltestosterone as a powerful AAS with attributes of a selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) and some indication of toxicity. Chemistry Desoxymethyltestosterone, also known as 3-desoxy-17Œ±-methyl-Œ¥2-5Œ±-dihydrotestosterone (3-desoxy-17Œ±-methyl-Œ¥2-DHT) or as 17Œ±-methyl-5Œ±-androst-2-en-17Œ≤-ol, is a synthetic androstane steroid and a 17Œ±-alkylated derivative of dihydrotestosterone (DHT). History Desoxymethyltestosterone was invented in 1961 by Max Huffman who obtained a patent on the compound the same year. It was described in the scientific literature in 1963. However, it was never brought to market as a commercial drug. Desoxymethyltestosterone was rediscovered by chemist, AAS enthusiast, and amateur bodybuilder Patrick Arnold in 2005. Arnold produced desoxymethyltestosterone and supplied it to Victor Conte of Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative (BALCO), an American nutritional supplement company and steroid supplier. DMT became a controlled substance in the US on January 4, 2010, and is classified as a Schedule III anabolic steroid under the United States Controlled Substances Act along with boldione and dienedione.Rules - 2008 - Classification of Three Steroids as Schedule III Anabolic Steroids Under the Controlled Substances Act The substance had come under scrutiny after it was found to be present in several over-the-counter bodybuilding supplements.

On the other hand, Parsons argued any successful social system has four functional prerequisites: * Adaptation * Goal attainment * Integration * Pattern maintenance Adaptation ‚Äì To survive, any society needs the basics of food and shelter. Having these gives any society control over its environment. A society needs a functioning economy to provide this. Goal attainment ‚Äì all societies must provide collective goals of some sort for its members to aspire to. Governments set goals such as New Labour setting a target of 50% of school graduates to attend university. To facilitate meeting such goals, governments provide resources, laws, and other institutional mechanisms. Integration ‚Äì all societies need a legal system that mediates conflict and protects the social system from breaking down. Pattern maintenance ‚Äì Institutions like education and the family reaffirm the essential values needed for society to function.
