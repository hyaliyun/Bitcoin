The year before, Edward Balliol had seized the Scottish Crown, surreptitiously supported by Edward III. He was shortly expelled from the kingdom by a popular uprising. Edward III used this as a casus belli and invaded Scotland. The immediate target was the strategically important border town of Berwick. An advance force laid siege to the town in March. Edward III and the main English army joined it in May and pressed the attack. A large Scottish army advanced to relieve the town. After unsuccessfully manoeuvring for position and knowing that Berwick was on the verge of surrender, the Scots felt compelled to attack the English at Halidon Hill on 19 July. The Scots suffered a crushing defeat, and Berwick surrendered on terms the next day. Balliol was reinstalled as king of Scotland after ceding a large part of his territory to Edward III and agreeing to do homage for the balance. Background The First War of Scottish Independence between England and Scotland began in March 1296, when Edward I of England () stormed and sacked the Scottish border town of Berwick as a prelude to his invasion of Scotland. After 30 years of warfare that followed, the newly-crowned 14-year-old King Edward III was nearly captured in the English disaster at Stanhope Park. This brought his regents, Isabella of France and Roger Mortimer, to the negotiating table. They agreed to the Treaty of Northampton with Robert Bruce () in 1328 but this treaty was widely resented in England and commonly known as turpis pax, \\"the cowards' peace\\". Some Scots nobles, refusing to swear fealty to Bruce, were disinherited and left Scotland to join forces with Edward Balliol, son of King John I of Scotland (), whom Edward I had deposed in 1296. Robert Bruce died in 1329; his heir was 5-year-old David II (). In 1331, under the leadership of Edward Balliol and Henry Beaumont, 4th Earl of Buchan, the disinherited Scottish nobles gathered in Yorkshire and plotted an invasion of Scotland. Edward III was aware of the scheme and officially forbade it, in March 1332 writing to his northern officials that anyone planning an invasion of Scotland was to be arrested. The reality was different, and Edward III was happy to cause trouble for his northern neighbour. He insisted that Balliol not invade Scotland overland from England but turned a blind eye to his forces sailing for Scotland from Yorkshire ports on 31 July 1332. The Scots were aware of the situation and were waiting for Balliol. David II's regent was an experienced old soldier, Thomas Randolph, 1st Earl of Moray. He had prepared for Balliol and Beaumont, but he died ten days before they sailed. Five days after landing in Fife, Balliol's force of some 2,000 men met the Scottish army of 12,000–15,000 men. The Scots were crushed at the Battle of Dupplin Moor. Thousands of Scots died, including much of the nobility of the realm. Balliol was crowned king of Scotland at Sconethe traditional place of coronation for Scottish monarchson 24 September 1332. Almost immediately, Balliol granted Edward III Scottish estates to a value of £2,000, which included \\"the town, castle and county of Berwick\\". Balliol's support within Scotland was limited and within six months it had collapsed. He was ambushed by supporters of David II at the Battle of Annan a few months after his coronation. Balliol fled to England half-dressed and riding bareback. He appealed to Edward III for assistance. Prelude Berwick, on the North Sea coast of Britain, is on the Anglo-Scottish border, astride the main invasion and trade route in either direction. In the Middle Ages, it was the gateway from Scotland to the English eastern march. According to William Edington, a bishop and chancellor of England, Berwick was \\"so populous and of such commercial importance that it might rightly be called another Alexandria, whose riches were the sea and the water its walls\\". It was the most successful trading town in Scotland, and the duty on wool which passed through it was the Scottish Crown's largest single source of income. During centuries of war between the two nations its strategic value and relative wealth led to a succession of raids, sieges and takeovers. Battles were rare, as the Scots preferred guerrilla tactics and border raiding into England. Berwick had been sold to the Scots by Richard I of England () 140 years before, to raise funds for his crusade. The town was captured and sacked by Edward I in 1296, the first significant action of the First War of Scottish Independence. Twenty-two years later Robert Bruce retook it after bribing an English guard, expelling the last English garrison from Scottish soil. King Edward II of England () attempted to recapture Berwick in 1319 but abandoned the siege after a Scottish army bypassed him and defeated a hastily assembled army under the Archbishop of York at the Battle of Myton. At the beginning of 1333, the atmosphere on the border was tense; Edward III had dropped all pretence of neutrality, recognised Balliol as king of Scotland and was making ready for war. The English parliament met at York and debated the situation for five days without conclusion. Edward III promised to discuss the matter with both Pope John XXII and King Philip VI of France (). Possibly to prevent the Scots from taking the initiative, England began openly preparing for war, while announcing that it was Scotland which was preparing to invade England. In Scotland Archibald Douglas was Guardian of the Realm for the underage David. He was the brother of the \\"Good\\" Sir James Douglas, a hero of the First War of Independence. Weapons and supplies were gathered as he made arrangements for the defence of Berwick. Patrick Dunbar, Earl of March, the keeper of Berwick Castle, had recently spent nearly £200 on its defences. Sir Alexander Seton was appointed Governor of Berwick, responsible for the defence of the town. After it was sacked in 1296, Edward I had replaced the old wooden palisade with stone walls. These were considerably improved by the Scots in 1318. The walls stretched for and were up to thick and high. They were protected by towers, each up to tall. The wall to the south-west was further protected by the River Tweed, which was crossed by a stone bridge and entered the town at a stone gatehouse. Berwick Castle was to the west of the town, separated by a broad moat, making the town and castle independent strongholds. Berwick was well-defended, well-stocked with provisions and materiel, and expected to withstand a long siege. Siege Balliol, in command of the disinherited Scottish lords and some English magnates, crossed the border on 10 March. Edward III made grants of over £1,000 to the nobles accompanying him on the campaign and a similar amount was paid to Balliol's companions; Balliol received over £700 personally. He marched through Roxburghshire, burning and pillaging as he went and capturing Oxnam. He reached Berwick in late March and cut it off by land. Edward III's navy had already isolated it by sea. Balliol and the nobles accompanying him are said to have sworn not to withdraw until Berwick had fallen. Edward arrived at Berwick with the main English army on 9May, after leaving Queen Philippa at Bamburgh Castle south of Berwick. Balliol had been at Berwick for six weeks and had placed the town under close siege. Trenches had been dug, the water supply cut and all communication with the hinterland prevented. A scorched-earth policy was applied to the surrounding area to deny supplies for the town if an opportunity to break the siege occurred. The pillaging of the countryside also added to the English army's supplies. The army included troops raised in the Welsh Marches and the Midlands, as well as levies from the north which had already mustered on account of the earlier Scottish raids. By the end of the month, this force had been augmented by noble retinues, a muster at Newcastle, and the assembly of the English fleet in the River Tyne. Accompanying the army were craftsmen to build siege engines. Thirty-seven masons prepared nearly 700 stone missiles for the siege; these were transported by sea from Hull on 16 May. Edward III had arranged for the combined army to be revictualled by sea through the small port of Tweedmouth. A pen and ink sketch of a counterweight trebuchet Douglas had assembled a large army north of the border but his inactivity contrasts sharply with Robert Bruce's swift response to the siege of 1319. Douglas seems to have spent the time assembling ever more troops, rather than using those he already had to mount diversionary raids. Minor raids into Cumberland were launched by Sir Archibald Douglas. These were insufficient to draw the English forces from the siege. But it gave Edward III a pretext for his invasion, of which he took full advantage. The success of Edward III's propaganda is reflected in contemporaneous English chronicles, which portray his invasion as retaliation against Scottish incursions, With the arrival of Edward III, the assault on Berwick began. It was commanded by the Flemish soldier-merchant John Crabb. Crabb had defended Berwick from the English in 1319, been captured by them in 1332 and now used his knowledge of Berwick's defences on England's behalf. Catapults and trebuchets were used to great effect. The English used some form of firearms during the siege and modern historian Ranald Nicholson states that Berwick was probably \\"the first town in the British Isles to be bombarded by cannon\\". In late June, the defenders set adrift burning brushwood soaked in tar, in an attempt to repel a naval assault. Instead of the English ships, much of the town was set on fire. William Seton, a son of the town's governor, was killed fighting an English seabourne assault. By the end of June the attacks by land and sea had brought the town to a state of ruin and the garrison close to exhaustion. It is believed that a desire for a respite from the plunging fire of the two large counterweight trebuchets used by the English was a significant factor in Seton requesting a short truce from King Edward. This was granted, but only on the condition that he surrender if not relieved by 11 July. Seton's son, Thomas, was to be a hostage to the agreement, along with eleven others. Relief force Douglas was now faced with a situation similar to that which the English had faced before the Battle of Bannockburn. Nicholson considers that \\"If Berwick were to be saved immediate action on the part of the Scottish guardian was unavoidable\\". As a matter of national pride Douglas would have to come to the relief of Berwick, just as Edward II had come to the relief of Stirling Castle in 1314. The army that Douglas had spent so much time gathering was now compelled to take to the field. The English army is estimated to have been less than 10,000 strong – outnumbered approximately two-to-one by the Scots. Douglas entered England on 11July, the last day of Seton's truce. He advanced eastwards to Tweedmouth and destroyed it in sight of the English army. Edward III did not move. Sir William Keith, with Sir Alexander Gray and Sir William Prenderguest, led a force of around 200 Scottish cavalry. With some difficulty, they forced their way across the ruins of the bridge to the northern bank of the Tweed and made their way into the town. Douglas considered the town relieved. He sent messages to Edward III calling on him to depart, threatening that if he failed to do so, the Scots army would devastate England. The Scots were challenged to do their worst. The defenders argued that Keith's 200 horsemen constituted the relief according to the truce and therefore they did not have to surrender. Edward III stated that this was not the case: they had to be relieved directly from Scotlandliterally from the direction of Scotlandwhereas Keith, Gray and Prenderguest had approached Berwick from the direction of England. Edward III ruled that the truce agreement had been breached – the town having neither surrendered nor been relieved. A gallows was constructed directly outside the town walls and, as the highest-ranking hostage, Thomas Seton was hanged while his parents watched. Edward III issued instructions that each day the town failed to surrender, another two hostages should be hanged. Keith, having taken command of the town from Seton, concluded a fresh truce on 15 July, promising to surrender if not relieved by sunset on 19July. The truce comprised two indentures, one between Edward III and the town of Berwick and the other between Edward III and March, the keeper of Berwick Castle. It defined circumstances in which relief would or would not occur. The terms of surrender were not unconditional. The town was to be returned to English soil and law but the inhabitants were to be allowed to leave, with their goods and chattels, under a safe conduct from Edward III. All members of the garrison would also be given free passage. Relief was defined as one of three events: 200 Scottish men-at-arms fighting their way into Berwick; the Scottish army forcing its way across a specific stretch of the River Tweed; or, defeat of the English army in open battle on Scottish soil. On concluding the new treaty, Keith was allowed to immediately leave Berwick, travel to wherever the Guardian of Scotland happened to be, advise him of the terms of the treaty, and return safely to Berwick. A 19th-century view of the Scottish charge at Halidon Hill By this time Douglas had marched south to Bamburgh, where Edward III's queen Philippa was still staying, and besieged it; Douglas hoped that this would cause Edward III to break off his siege. In 1319 Edward III's father, Edward II, had broken off a siege of Berwick after a Scottish army had advanced on York, where his queen was staying, and devastated Yorkshire. However, whatever concerns Edward III had for his queen, he ignored the threat to Bamburgh. The Scots did not have the time to construct the kind of equipment that would be necessary to take the fortress by assault. The Scots devastated the countryside but Edward III ignored this. He positioned the English army on Halidon Hill, a small rise of some , to the north-west of Berwick, which gives an excellent view of the town and the vicinity. From this vantage point, he dominated the crossing of the Tweed specified in the indentures and would have been able to attack the flank of any force of men- at-arms attempting to enter Berwick. Receiving Keith's news, Douglas felt that his only option was to engage the English in battle. Crossing the Tweed to the west of the English position, the Scottish army reached the town of Duns, from Berwick, on 18July. On the following day it approached Halidon Hill from the north-west, ready to give battle on ground chosen by Edward III. Edward III had to face the Scottish army to the front and guard his rear against the risk of a sortie by the garrison of Berwick. By some accounts, a large proportion of the English army was left guarding Berwick. To engage the English, the Scots had to advance downhill, cross a large area of marshy ground and then climb the northern slope of Halidon Hill. The Battle of Dupplin Moor the previous year had shown how vulnerable the Scots were to arrows. The prudent course of action would have been to withdraw and wait for a better opportunity to fight, but this would guarantee the loss of Berwick. The armies encountered each other's scouts around midday on 19July. Douglas ordered an attack. The Lanercost Chronicle reports: The Scots suffered many casualties and the lower reaches of the hill were littered with dead and wounded. The survivors continued upwards, through the arrows \\"as thick as motes in a sun beam\\", according to an unnamed contemporary quoted by Nicholson, and on to the waiting spears. The Scottish army broke, the camp followers made off with the horses and the fugitives were pursued by the mounted English knights. The Scottish casualties numbered in thousands, including Douglas and five earls dead on the field. Scots who surrendered were killed on Edward's orders and some drowned as they fled into the sea. English casualties were reported as fourteen; some chronicles give a lower figure of seven. About a hundred Scots who had been taken prisoner were beheaded the next morning, 20July. This was the date that Berwick's second truce expired, and the town and the castle surrendered on the terms in the indentures. Aftermath After the capitulation of Berwick, Edward III appointed Baron Henry Percy as Constable, with Sir Thomas Grey (father of the chronicler Thomas Grey) as his deputy. Considering his part done and short of money, he left for the south. On 19June 1334, Balliol did homage to Edward for Scotland, after formally ceding to England the eight counties of south-east Scotland. Balliol ruled a truncated Scottish state from Perth, from where he attempted to put down the remaining resistance. Seton in turn did homage to Balliol. Balliol was deposed again in 1334, restored again in 1335 and finally deposed in 1336, by those loyal to David II. Berwick was to remain the military and political headquarters of the English on the border until 1461, when it was returned to the Scottish by King Henry VI (). Clifford Rogers states that Berwick \\"remained a bone of contention throughout the Middle Ages\\", until its final re-capture for the English by the Duke of Gloucester, the future King Richard III, in 1482.

She specialised in studying Hadrian's Wall, and was instrumental in bringing to publication excavations under York Minster.  Education and career  Swinbank went to Durham University in 1946 to study Modern History, where she was inspired by Eric Birley, who invited Swinbank to stay at his house at Chesterholm, near Vindolanda, and who later described her as a \\"really competent excavator and field archaeologist\\", to excavate at Corbridge and Housesteads. During her studies at Durham she was president of the Durham College's History Society and was a member of St Aidan's Society. She graduated in 1949 with an upper second class degree in History, and attended the Hadrian's Wall Pilgrimage before being awarded a two-year Durham Colleges Research Studentship. In 1950, Swinbank supervised excavations at Birdoswald with John Gillam, before completing her thesis The Vallum Reconsidered, for which she received a doctorate from Durham University in 1954. This made her the third British woman to be awarded a PhD for a thesis on the archaeology of Britain. Swinbank also excavated sections of the Vallum including at Cawfields and Great Chesters as part of her research, as well as Bewcastle, the Carrawburgh Mithraeum with Ian Richmond, Castell Collen with Leslie Alcock, and Penydarren. In 1956, Swinbank began a two-year assistant lectureship at the University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire, covering the history of Europe from the Classical Period to the Dark Ages. In 1958, she featured alongside Eric Birley, John Gillam and Kate Hodgson in a BBC Home Service broadcast marking 1,800 years' study of Hadrian's Wall. Swinbank was also elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1958. However, despite her achievements she was not granted a permanent university position, and in the autumn of that year took up an appointment as Assistant History Mistress at Ackworth School, one of a few Quaker educational establishments in England. It was not until the late 1960s that Swinbank was able to again involve herself more fully in archaeology. She connected with Peter Wenham, an archaeologist and contact of Eric Birley, whom she began to assist with lectures and excavations, including preparing the final report of the excavations of the vicus at Malton in 1971. In 1974, she joined in the post-excavation processing of the great mass of archaeological materials unearthed during the stabilization of York Minster. In the words of her biographer, these consisted of \\"rooms full of documents, soil samples, pieces of pottery and bone, 3,000 photographs, chunks of carved stonework and even one large block of dirt weighing several tonnes.\\" She brought these to publication as the first volume of the York Minster materials and also, in 1992, became a director of The Yorkshire Architectural & York Archaeological Society. After this Swinbank returned to her former interests on the vallum of Hadrian's Wall, which, with the assistance of David Breeze, she published in the late 2000s.  Personal life  Brenda Swinbank was born on 2 February 1929, in Ackworth, England, the youngest of five siblings. She married Peter Heywood, a teacher and colleague at the Friends’ School in Ackworth, with whom she had two sons and a daughter who died. Following Peter's death from prostate cancer in 2010, Swinbank moved to London to be closer to her sons., one of which, Jeremy Heywood, was a Cabinet Secretary and Head of the Home Civil Service. By 2017, Swinbank was living with dementia; Swinbank's daughter-in-law, Suzanne Heywood, wrote a biography of her life based on Swinbank's own writings along with recollections from Swinbank's friends and colleagues.  Legacy  Whilst no longer active, Swinbank's notes from her survey of the vallum have been used by researchers at Newcastle University as part of WallCAP to undertake further research at Heddon-on-the-Wall. TrowelBlazers, an organisation dedicated to increasing the representation of women in archaeology, including through publishing biographies on their website, have included Swinback as a notable figure for her contributions to the study of Hadrian's Wall and York Minster. It is noted, however, Swinbank was hindered by her inability to focus more on archaeology, and her work has ultimately not received much recognition beyond those specialising in Hadrian's Wall.

The Government of Nicaragua rejected a special commission of the Organization of American States, OAS, to mediate the country's crisis. The proposal was presented by the United States, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Canada, Chile, Mexico and Peru.Daniel Ortega said that they try to meddle in matters that belong to his government and rejected the initiative through a note of protest sent to the Inter-American agency. Students of the UNAN-León, as well as representatives of the April 19 University Movement, Blue and white, self-called and the same population, left to march to demand justice and democracy. = August = *1 August – The president of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, said that the influence of jihadist terrorism of the self-styled Islamic State arrived in his country and gave as an example the murders that have taken place in the framework of the protests against his government since last April 18. \\"It seems that the influence of ISIS has come through the (social) networks to Nicaragua,\\" the president said. The head of the Nicaraguan Army, General Julio César Avilés, said that the country's sociopolitical crisis is also a time to reflect and contribute. Dialogue is the \\"most convincing\\" route for Nicaraguans to overcome the socio- political crisis their country is going through, said the head of the Nicaraguan Army, General Julio César Avilés. This at the same time to stop the protests started on April 18 and which have already left between 295 and 448 dead. The socio-political crisis in Nicaragua has caused the closure of several universities in the Central American country. Nicaragua loses 230 million dollars in tourism due to crisis. In the Countryside of Nicaragua there is protest for the release of political prisoners and detainees. * 2 August – With the approval of twenty countries, the Organization of American States (OAS) created on Thursday a special commission to contribute to the search for solutions to the crisis in Nicaragua. Only four countries voted against, including Nicaragua itself. The working group that will follow up on the situation in Nicaragua has not yet been formed, but the representatives of the United States, Costa Rica, Brazil and Chile expressed interest. A group of Nicaraguan women, headed by the poet Gioconda Belli, requested by means of a letter to the Nicaraguan Army to \\"disarm\\" the paramilitary groups that \\"usurp\\" the functions of the country's armed forces, in the midst of the crisis that has left between 317 and 448 dead since April. He is secretly tried for the assassination of young Brazilian Raiella Grabrielle Lima A source from the Prosecutor's Office informed that Pierson Gutiérrez Solís had pleaded guilty in the preliminary hearing, and that afterwards the penalty debate was proceeded, in which the State requested the minimum for homicide: 10 years in prison; and six months for illegal carrying of weapons. * 3 August – The independent journalists will hold a sit-in at 10:00 a.m. in the morning, at the Metrocentro roundabout, to demand freedom of the press for Daniel Ortega, since he has been violated by his government, since three months ago the protests in the country began. The brothers Luis Miguel, Jean Carlos, and Harvin Roberto, all of Esteban Lesage surnames, were capturaed by the police, on July 11 and are now being accused of terrorism, organized crime and simple kidnapping, for participating in marches against the government of Daniel Ortega. Doctors from Nicaragua yesterday denounced new layoffs to health workers who have treated protesters injured in protests against President Daniel Ortega, in a crisis that has left between 317 and 448 dead since April.At least 11 doctors and health workers were dismissed for having treated the injured protesters in the department of Carazo, and more than 10 in Masaya, according to a public complaint, issued through the Permanent Commission of Human Rights (CPDH). *4 August – Sandinista forces attack and besiege the channel 100% News. The self-appointed demonstrators of Nicaragua left on Saturday in the streets of Managua, to publicly support the doctors who have been dismissed, who point out political motivations behind their dismissals, for attending protesters wounded in the protests against Daniel Ortega's government. Nicaraguan human rights organizations have denounced arbitrary dismissals of at least 135 doctors, specialists and subspecialists of the public hospitals of the country. Alfredo Mairena, brother of Medardo Mairena, said on Saturday that the leader of the Peasant Movement had been tortured and that they had not allowed a doctor to examine him, to check his health. \\"I saw my brother nine days ago. They have tortured him to blows. We do not know the state of health, the doctor we are looking for to review it has not been authorized to check it. He told me that there are death threats for me and the whole family\\", said Alfredo Mairena. * 18 August – 4 months of protests. * 20 August – The caravan of vehicles of opponents to the government was intercepted and dispersed by gunfire while on its way to Masaya.

At least 40 people have been fired this Monday from the National Autonomous University of Nicaragua (UNAN-Managua), according to one of the people whose employment contract was canceled.The source, who requested anonymity for fear of future reprisals, said that the dismissals have reached plant teachers and administrative workers from various faculties (Humanities, Administration, Medicine) and academic departments. Relatives of Carlos Cárdenas, technical advisor to Monsignor Rolando Álvarez, member of the Episcopal Conference (CEN) at the National Dialogue table, denounced today that hooded people held him against his will and took him to a place they have not confirmed * 22 August – The government of Daniel Ortega uncovered the persecution at institutional level against Channel 10, the night of this Wednesday, after the Financial Analysis Unit (UAF) announced the opening of \\"a process of financial intelligence\\" against Carlos Pastora, manager of that television * 23 August – A 14-year-old boy who was on his way to school yesterday suffered unprecedented torture in the annals of the country's conflict. Accompanied by his mother, the boy, he reported that a police patrol of the Directorate of Special Operations (DOEP) stopped him when he was going to school and they put him in a booth in the parking lot of District V of the National Police in Managua.There, several hooded officers tortured him, and tattooed the acronym FSLN on his arm with a syringe, he told CPDH. The United Airlines United canceled, for 15 days, its flights to Managua because its crews fear to travel at night and spend the night in Nicaraguan soil.United Airlines Inc., is one of the three largest companies in the United States in this field and has its offices in Chicago, Illinois. American Airlines and Delta Airlines complete the trio of the three largest airlines in that country. Commissioner Francisco Díaz was named by Daniel Ortega as the new head of the National Police, sending Commissioner Aminta Granera to retirement.Ortega makes this appointment to his consort under a presidential decree, despite the sanctions of the Magnitsky Global Law applied to Díaz last July.

The majority of Nicaraguans believe they are innocent because the trial was political because they are not to blame for the fact. The Brazilian-American documentary maker Emilia Mello, who was deported from Nicaragua after being detained by police on Saturday when she was heading to Granada to film an anti-government demonstration, said she was detained for 30 hours and suffered \\"psychological abuse.\\" Rosario Murillo threatened those who participate in demonstrations against Daniel Ortega to \\"stop playing with fire\\", his statements were given in the official media.\\"There are some ridiculous campaigns in social networks, terrorism, terrorism, stop playing with fire,\\" warned Murillo.The vice president issued his warning two days after hundreds of people showed their rejection of Ortega in the streets of the city of Leon, in a demonstration that was shot to death by the National Police, and in which at least 7 young people were arrested . * 28 August – As a \\"judicial circus,\\" so called Migueliuth Sandoval, wife of journalist Angel Gahona, the trial in which Brandon Lovo and Glen Slate pleaded guilty, for the murder of Gahona, Monday night. Judge Ernesto Rodríguez, of the Sixth Criminal Trial District, decreed 48 years of prison for young people.The judicial process took place in an environment of irregularities and secrecy. The family of Gahona considers that justice was not done in the case, because for them, the real culprits are the policemen who surrounded the journalist the day he died. In addition, they state that their rights were violated by not allowing them to be in the hearings. = September = *2 September – At least two people were wounded by gunshots fired by presumed paramilitaries sympathetic to President Daniel Ortega against an opposition march, which culminated in violence in the eastern part of the Nicaraguan capital. *7 September – About 90% of businesses participate in a national general strike in order to demand the release of political prisoners, costing Nicaragua an estimated $20–25 million per day. * 13 September – A group of feminist women sit and serenade in solidarity with the political prisoners in La Esperanza prison, located on the Masaya road.

Lipstick Rebellion * 17 October – A lipstick tube became the new and unexpected weapon of those who demand the departure of Ortega. In social networks, many women and men are sharing photos in which they appear with painted lips. #SoyDelPicoRojo, proclaim proud and challenging, using the colloquial name with which Nicaraguans refer to the mouth. And, often, the image is accompanied by a call for the release of \\"political prisoners\\" or the #SOSNicaragua label. Some 200 people are being tried in the Central American country on the charge of terrorism. The 38 captured Sunday, however, were the first to be arrested after the Nicaraguan Police warned that they would not allow demonstrations without their prior authorization. Among them was Marlen Chow, a former Sandinista sympathizer, who once in El Chipote, decided to use her lipstick as a form of protest released the next day, her answer baffled her interrogators, because she showed them \\"that we were not willing to cheat (scare).\\" But her simple and defiant gesture also did something else: she gave the Nicaraguans who protest against Ortega a new way of expressing their discontent without exposing themselves to jail. * 23 October – After growing 4.0% to 4.5% during the last five-year period, the Nicaraguan industrial sector forecasts a reduction to -0.5% for 2018. Even though, companies in the sector took all the precautions that contributed to keep them in operation.Given the Government's proposals to try to mitigate the economic effects of the political crisis with economic measures, industrialists demand political decisions.\\"First, the political crisis should be resolved, all COSEP (The Private Enterprise Council) chambers have been emphasizing since five months ago. That’s why we are part of the Civic Alliance for Justice and Democracy—the dialogue than we yearn for should take place,\\" said Sergio Maltez, President of the Chamber of Industries of Nicaragua (CADIN), on the television program \\"Esta Noche\\" (Tonight) * 24 October – Group of paramilitaries related to the government of Daniel Ortega illegally kidnaps and detains people.

Chemicals that meet this standard may be sold as “ACS Reagent Grade” materials. These standards relieve working chemists of concerns about how pure their chemicals are: if they order “ACS Reagent Grade,” they are assured of consistent purity, no matter which supplier they order from. ACS Reagent Grade chemicals can also be used for procedures that require stringent quality specifications and a purity of equal to or greater than 95% . The American Chemical Society does not validate the purity of chemicals sold with this designation, but it relies on suppliers, acting in their self-interest, to meet these standards. This arrangement has worked well for many decades. In addition to specifications for each chemical, Reagent Chemicals provides detailed methods for determining how to measure the properties and impurities listed in the specifications. There are detailed explanations of many types of analyses – gas, liquid, ion, and headspace chromatography, atomic absorption spectroscopy, and optical emission spectroscopy, to name a few. Reagent Chemicals is primarily of interest to manufacturers and suppliers of chemicals to laboratories worldwide. Most chemists simply specify “ACS Reagent Grade,” knowing that these chemicals will be sufficiently pure for their needs, without knowing the details. Many standards organizations and federal agencies that set guidelines require the use of ACS-grade regent chemicals for many test procedures. This includes the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). An exception would be those working on trace analyses (measuring contaminants in the environment, for example), where small impurities in reagents would be significant. Reagent Chemicals Online After eleven paper editions over 68 years, Reagent Chemicals became an electronic resource in 2017. This allows content to be updated as standards change and new reagents are added. The publication is updated several times a year with new reagents and new methods of analysis. Changes are published online six months before they become the official standard, allowing manufacturers to adjust their labels or processes. While the full details of most reagents are behind a paywall, that for acetone is publicly available to showcase a typical entry. History of Reagent Chemicals Early 1900s The need for high-quality analytical reagent grade chemicals was recognized by chemists in the early 1900s when variations in the purity of routinely used laboratory chemicals began to produce unacceptable variations in the analytical analysis. 1903 With these concerns in mind, the American Chemical Society took the initiative to create the Committee on the Purity of Reagents, the forerunner of the Committee on Analytical Reagents. 1917 The American Chemical Society established the ACS Committee on Analytical Reagents. This Committee, over the past 100 years, has established specifications for reagent grade chemicals used worldwide. William F. Hillebrand (1853-1925) was appointed the chairman of the committee. Hillebrand was one of Washington's most distinguished chemists. He achieved such stature first with the Geological Survey and then with the Bureau of Standards. His colleagues referred to him as the \\"Supreme Court of Chemistry.\\" He played a paramount role in judging which analytical methods would be published as ACS standards. 1920s The Committee began publishing specifications for reagent chemical and test methods in scientific journals during the early 1920s. Analytical methods, at this point, were primarily what we now consider to be “Classical Wet Methods.” 1950 The publication of the 1st edition of Reagent Chemicals introduced the application of analytical instrumentation. The introduction of these instruments into Reagent Chemicals forever changed the analytical laboratory. Chemists could improve sensitivity levels, as well as testing accuracy. Improved sensitivity created an opportunity for the Committee to re-evaluate certain purity and impurity level specifications to create special use reagents. An example would be “Spectrophotometric Grade Solvents.” 2000 The 9th edition was published and continued a trend toward eliminating or simplifying some tedious classical procedures for trace analyses and adding instrumental methods, where possible. 2006 The release of the 10th edition introduced Monographs for Standard-Grade Reference Materials. 2016 The 11th edition introduces heavy metal test methodologies utilizing ICP- OES. 2017 The new online edition of Reagent Chemicals, based on the 11th edition in print, improved the speed and simplicity with which the Committee communicates updates and changes by bringing the entire reference resource to the award-winning ACS journals platform. Committee Objectives The ACS Committee on Analytical Reagents is the only Committee in the world dedicated to establishing specifications and developing validated test methods for determining the purity of analytical reagents. From the printing of the 1st edition of Reagent Chemicals in 1950 to the publication of today’s 11th edition, the principal goal of the ACS Committee on Analytical Reagents is to establish specifications and test methods for analytical reagents that allow the scientific community to produce reliable and accurate analytical results. The Committee is also dedicated to the utilization of new techniques and technologies to improve the sensitivity, precision and accuracy of analytical methodologies. The Committee also strives to utilize available resources to remove and replace chemicals that pose either significant health risks to analysts or are deemed harmful to the environment, whenever possible, from current test methodologies. Today’s Committee Members of the Committee on Analytical Reagents primarily come from three principal areas: :I. Industry * Chemical Manufacturers * Pharmaceutical Manufacturers :II. Academia *University Chemistry Departments :III. Governmental Organizations * National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) * US Geological Survey * Environmental Protection Agency The Main Committee on Analytical Reagents is composed of four working sub-committees: I.

Buconjić, who was born in Drinovci, Herzegovina, during the Ottoman rule, joined the Franciscan Custody of Herzegovina in 1851 and after a year of novitiate, he became a full member of the Franciscan Order. He attended schools in Ferrara and the Papal States, and was ordained a priest in 1856. He then lectured in Rome between 1860 and 1867, when he returned to Herzegovina, where he lectured in Široki Brijeg. Buconjić became a chaplain in 1871 and in 1873, he became a vicar in Drinovci. He was elected Custos of the Franciscan Custody of Herzegovina 1874, a position he held until 1877. During the Herzegovina Uprising of 1875-1877, Buconjić with Bishop Anđeo Kraljević helped to pacify the Catholic population and supported the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina by Austria-Hungary. In 1875, Buconjić published a booklet titled \\"The Main Reasons for the Uprising of the Christian Population in Herzegovina\\" and sent it to the representatives of several European countries, which raised awareness among the European powers regarding the position of Christians. At the Congress of Berlin in 1878, it was decided Bosnia and Herzegovina would be occupied by Austria- Hungary. Buconjić was an important figure in Croatian politics during the Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 1880, after the Austrian- Hungarian occupation, Buconjić was appointed Apostolic Vicar of Herzegovina and a titular bishop of Magydus, and was consecrated in Zagreb the same year. With the restoration of the regular Church hierarchy in 1881, Buconjić was appointed the first Bishop of the newly established Diocese Mostar-Duvno. As a bishop, he favored his Franciscan Custody over the interests of the diocese. He tried to postpone the restoration of the regular Church hierarchy until 1889, when Pope Leo XIII issued a Decisia allowing Franciscans to retain some parishes and designating others to the diocesan clergy. The Franciscans largely ignored the Decisia. In 1890, the Diocese of Trebinje-Mrkan, to whose northern and northern-eastern parts Bishop Paškal pretended, was exempted from the administration of Bishop of Dubrovnik and was given to Bishop of Mostar- Duvno for administration; after this, the whole of Herzegovina was under Buconjić's jurisdiction. Buconjić died in Mostar on 8 December 1910 and was buried in the Church of Saint Peter and Paul in Mostar. He was succeeded in his post by Alojzije Mišić in 1912.  Early life and education  Paškal Buconjić was born in Drinovci near Grude, Herzegovina, which at the time was part of the Ottoman Empire, to father Stjepan and mother Vida née Šimić. Buconjić's family originated in Ošalj near Ston and were known as Vodopić while their family name was translated as Bevillacqua in Italian. Part of that family moved to Neum, where Buconjić's father Stjepan was born. After entering into a conflict with the local Ottoman governor, Stjepan fled to Mostar and worked for some families there. He later traded in livestock and bought land in Drinovci, where he married Vida Šimić. They had six sons and five daughters. Buconjić was baptized as Stjepan on 16 August 1834 in Slivno, where Christians had fled due to inter-Muslim violence during the Bosnian uprising. In January 1846, his father took him to Franciscans in Čerigaj for education and to become a monk. He remained in Čerigaj until 1849, when the Franciscans built the first wing of the monastery in Široki Brijeg, where he moved with the rest of the monks. Buconjić became a monk and took the name Paškal on 13 October 1851. After a year in the novitiate, he took monastic vows on 10 November 1852. After becoming a monk, Buconjić continued his education in Ferrara in the Papal States and became a priest. He was ordained there on 21 December 1856. While in Ferrara, under the influence of the pro-Austrian Croat military officers, Buconjić became a supporter of the Croatian cause and the Austrian monarchy. On 18 December 1858, Buconjić passed the professor exam in Bologne, where he discussed natural law and was awarded the highest grades. When General Minister of the Franciscan Order Bernardino Trionfetti de Montefranco saw his grades, he invited Buconjić to Rome to lecture at the Central Franciscan University, where Buconjić was appointed professor on 8 June 1860. Buconjić's lecturing drafts during his tenure were not preserved but the speech he gave before the Pontifical Croatian College of St. Jerome was published under the title \\"Speech on the Occasion of the Millennial Celebration of the SS Slavic Apostles Cyril and Methodius\\" in 1863.  Custos of the Franciscan Custody of Herzegovina  Buconjić lectured in Rome until 20 December 1866, when he returned to the Franciscan monastery to teach dogma and morals. In 1871, he was named a chaplain and in 1873, he was appointed a vicar in Drinovci. Buconjić was elected Custos of the Franciscan Custody of Herzegovina on 31 May 1874 for a three-year term. = Herzegovina uprising = In April 1875, during the turmoil between Christians and the Ottoman authorities in Herzegovina, Austrian-Hungarian Emperor Franz Joseph visited neighboring Dalmatia, where he received two Franciscan delegations in Imotski on 24 April and in Vrgorac the next day. Buconjić led the delegation of nine Franciscans in Imotski and presented the emperor with a memorandum about the hardships of Christians in Herzegovina. On that occasion, the emperor decorated him with the Commander's Star of the Order of Franz Joseph. The Ottoman authorities viewed this as an act of treason. In June 1875, Christians started the Herzegovina uprising; Catholics of Gabela, led by Ivan Musić—who was Kraljević's nephew—were the first to rebel. The Ottoman authorities asked the Apostolic Vicar of Herzegovina Bishop Anđeo Kraljević to help them to pacify the rebels but this bid failed and the Ottoman authorities allowed foreign powers to find a peaceful solution. The representatives of the United Kingdom, Germany, Russia, Austria-Hungary, Italy and France arrived in Mostar. Buconjić issued a booklet in Italian called \\"The Main Reasons for the Uprising of the Christian Population in Herzegovina\\" and gave it to six foreign consuls. In this booklet, Buconjić stated high taxes were the main factor in the uprising. Kraljević and Buconjić helped pacify the Catholics who participated in the uprising because the Catholic leadership viewed the unrest in Herzegovina as a potential struggle for the annexation of Bosnia to Serbia and of Herzegovina to Montenegro. They were successful in their mission; on 19 February 1877, Kraljević informed the Propaganda in Rome the Catholics of Herzegovina enjoyed \\"peace and rest\\". After finding Serbia had requested the annexation of Bosnia from the Ottoman Empire, Kraljević and Buconjić wrote to the Austrian-Hungarian authorities in July of 1876 asking them not to allow this, stating Bosnia and Herzegovina should be annexed by Austria-Hungary— to whom the Catholics are connected by their \\"historical past, and many other moral and material interests\\"—if the Ottoman authorities must leave. The Austrian-Hungarian public and authorities received the protestation very positively. During Buconjić's tenure as Custos, the theological education and novitiate were transferred from Široki Brijeg to the Humac Seminary near Ljubuški. Buconjić asked the General Minister of the Franciscan Order to proclaim the seminary a monastery, which was approved on 5 March 1876. Buconjić became suspicious to the Ottoman authorities and for safety he decided to move his residence from Široki Brijeg to Humac. = Conflict with Bishop Kraljević = The Franciscans of Herzegovina were on bad terms with Bishop Kraljević, claiming he did not give them enough of the collected alms for the construction of the monastery in Humac. The conflict between the bishop and the Franciscans reached its peak during Buconjić's tenure because Franciscans controlled all of the parishes in Herzegovina while the bishop, even though a Franciscan himself, wanted to have diocesan clergy at his disposal. An anonymous letter was sent to Emperor Franz Joseph claiming the bishop was giving donations sent to him by Austria-Hungary to the Ottomans and accusing him of being a turkophile. The Franciscan Custody barred itself from this letter. In February 1877, Kraljević asked the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples to send an apostolic visitor to Herzegovina and accused Buconjić of neglecting the parishes and the Herzegovinian Franciscans of taking the payment for maintenance by force from the believers during the Easter Communion. The Congregation appointed Bishop Kazimir Forlani the apostolic visitor; he arrived in Mostar in February the next year. Forlani finished his report in May 1878; he advised the Bishop to act in agreement with the Franciscans, to record revenues and expenditures, and to help the construction of the monastery in Humac. The question of the parishes remained unresolved. = Austrian-Hungarian occupation = In 1878, Bosnia and Herzegovina was occupied by Austria-Hungary. When Austrian-Hungarian Stjepan Jovanović entered Herzegovina via Vrgorac on 31 August 1878 to occupy the territory, Buconjić received him in the Humac monastery, and helped him to enter Ljubuški and rest of West Herzegovina without resistance. Not long after the occupation, Buconjić sent a telegram to Emperor Franz Joseph expressing his hope for the unification of Bosnia and Herzegovina with Croatia. Buconjić was also a member of the Bosnian-Herzegovinian delegation that went to Vienna to bow down before the Emperor. With the Austrian-Hungarian occupation, the Herzegovinian Franciscan Custody saw a decrease in financial revenues. They stopped receiving monetary donations from the Austrian-Hungarian Emperor, which he sent during the Ottoman occupation, and the new authorities relinquished all of their privileges given to them by the Ottomans, including tax exemption. Since they were no longer considered missionaries, the Franciscans stopped receiving donations from various societies, especially those from the Society for the Propagation of the Faith in Lyon. While Bishop Forlani was still in the official visitation, Buconjić's term was coming to an end. The General of the Franciscan Order advised not to elect the new leadership until the end of the visitation; he asked Forlani to make a list of suitable candidates and sent it to the Propaganda in Rome. Forlani proposed Marijan Zovko for the position of Custos, which the Propaganda approved on 20 June 1879. Buconjić read the Propaganda's decision on 4 August; upon receiving the news, Zovko refused his appointment due to illness. Zovko's resignation was refused and he was appointed Custos against his will. The new administration named Buconjić guardian of the Humac monastery on 18 August 1879. Buconjić had a leading role in the Croatian national movement in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where the new Austrian-Hungarian authorities forbade the use of the Croatian and Serbian names.  Apostolic Vicar of Herzegovina  Bishop Paškal Buconjić after his episcopal consecration in 1880 The Apostolic Vicar of Herzegovina, Bishop Anđeo Kraljević died on 27 July 1879 while on a chrismian visit to Konjic. Herzegovinian Franciscans chose Buconjić as his successor. Due to his loyalty to Austria-Hungary, the Austrian-Hungarian authorities lobbied for Buconjić to succeed Bishop Kraljević with a recommendation from the apostolic vicar of Bosnia, Bishop Paškal Vuičić. Pope Leo XIII approved Buconjić's nomination and issued two decrees on 30 January 1880 appointing Buconjić the apostolic vicar and a titular bishop of Magydus. To enhance the connection between Herzegovina and Croatia, Buconjić was consecrated a bishop by the Archbishop of Zagreb Cardinal Josip Mihalović in Zagreb on 19 March 1880, after which Buconjić visited the emperor in Vienna and the pope in Rome. Buconjić was finally installed as the apostolic vicar on 25 April 1880. His episcopal motto was \\"All for the faith and homeland\\". Buconjić's choice to be consecrated in Zagreb rather than by some neighboring bishops enabled Herzegovina to eliminate the dominance of the Bosnian Franciscans who, together with the Bishop of Đakovo Josip Juraj Strossmayer, tried to control it. Strossmayer, who also held the traditional title Bishop of Bosnia, tried to take the whole of Bosnia and Herzegovina under his jurisdiction. Buconjić worked steadily on his career. After the Austrian- Hungarian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878, the chances for Buconjić to become a residential bishop with the restoration of the regular Church hierarchy became palpable, unlike those of Paškal Vuičić. In March 1880, Cardinal Mihalović and Buconjić discussed the organization of the Church in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Early the same year in Vienna, Buconjić met with the Apostolic Nuncio to Austria-Hungary Cardinal Domenico Jacobini, who later consulted Mihalović about the organization of the Church in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Both of them became impressed with Buconjić.  Bishop of Mostar- Duvno  After the Austrian-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878, and the signing of the Convention between Austria-Hungary and the Holy See on 8 June 1881, the ground for episcopal nominations was established. According to the Convention, the emperor had an exclusive right to appoint bishops in the territories. From 5 July 1881, Pope Leo XIII with the apostolic bull Ex hac augusta restored the regular Church hierarchy in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The pope established the Archdiocese of Vrhbosna with a seat in Sarajevo and subordinated to it the newly established Diocese of Banja Luka, the already existing Diocese of Trebinje-Mrkan—which was under the apostolic administration of the Bishop of Dubrovnik—and the Diocese of Mostar-Duvno, to which he added the title of Bishop of Duvno. The Diocese of Mostar-Duvno included the territory of the Apostolic Vicariate of Herzegovina, which was abolished. Portrait of Bishop Paškal Due to his previous pro-Austrian stance, Minister of Finances Josip Szlávy nominated Buconjić for the post of Residential Bishop of Mostar-Duvno to the emperor, who agreed and appointed Buconjić the new residential bishop on 9 October 1881. The emperor's appointment was sent to Rome for official confirmation and Pope Leo XIII confirmed the appointment on 18 November 1881, absolving Buconjić of the title of Bishop of Magydus. As a bishop, Buconjić favored the Franciscan Custody more than his diocese. Rather than opening seminaries for the education of the diocesan clergy, Buconjić helped found two Franciscan seminaries; one as a gymnasium in Travnik that opened in 1882 and the other in Sarajevo as a theology seminary that opened in 1893. Only five diocesan priests were ordained during Buconjić's episcopate, compared with the ordination of over 70 Franciscans. Buconjić gave away some of the diocesan property to the Custody. He consecrated the cornerstone of the Franciscan monastery in Mostar, which was built on the site of a former parish house where the cathedral church was also located, on 19 March 1889. Buconjić agreed to make the church a monastery church while the new cathedral church was to be built with help from the imperial government. Buconjić informed the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith about this on 14 May 1885. Buconjić bought land for the cathedral church in the Rondo quarter of Mostar, where the present-day Croatian Lodge \\"Herceg Stjepan Kosača\\" is located. The land for the new cathedral was later put under a lien in benefit of the Franciscan Custody of Herzegovina due to debt; at that time, Buconjić was bedridden. The Bishop's Ordinariate built in Glavica, Mostar, during Buconjić's reign After the Austrian-Hungarian occupation in 1878, many Muslims, from whom Bishop Buconjić bought lands around Nevesinje and Bijelo Polje left the country. Buconjić helped Catholic Croats from areas around Ljubuški and Mostar, where they were overpopulated, to settle there. The authorities obstructed these internal migrations and encouraged migration from outside Bosnia and Herzegovina. Buconjić helped to establish higher education in Mostar, helping with the establishment of the Franciscan Seminary of Theology at the Franciscan monastery in Mostar in 1895. By establishing the Faculty of Theology, the Franciscan Custody of Herzegovina provided for the education of its cadets. Buconjić moved the Franciscan nuns to Mostar in 1899 and granted the Sisters of Mercy a house and a yard in Ljubuški. Buconjić built the Bishop's Ordinariate in Glavica, Mostar, from 1905 to 1909, and moved into it on 24 March 1909. During his 30-year episcopate, five diocesan priests in the Diocese of Mostar-Duvno were ordained. = Division of parishes = The main issue during Buconjić's episcopate diocese was the division of parishes between the diocesan clergy and the Franciscans, who tried to confirm their dominance in Herzegovina with Rome. Even though the papal bull Ex hac augusta ended the privileges the Franciscans enjoyed in their missionary work, they still wanted to retain all of the parishes in the diocese. The Franciscans were confident Buconjić, who himself was a Franciscan, would not disturb their possession of parishes. In December 1881, however, Custos Marijan Zovko wrote to the General of the Order about the parishes in Herzegovina. The General asked Zovko about the right of possession of those parishes, to which Zovko replied in February 1882 the Franciscans had established and controlled those parishes, and therefore had patronage over them. That December, Zovko again asked the General about the situation with the parishes in Herzegovina; the General responded that Herzegovinian Franciscans have nothing to be afraid of since Buconjić loved the Franciscan Custody. Buconjić confirmed to the General he would not take the parishes from the Franciscans but would retain the newly-established parishes for the diocese. The new Custos Luka Begić, who was elected in May 1883, became concerned the position of the Franciscans would be endangered, even if only the diocese controlled only the newly-established parishes, and insisted even those parishes should belong to the Franciscan Custody. He talked to Buconjić about the issue; Buconjić complied with his concerns and agreed the newly-established parishes should belong to the Custody. Begić informed the General about the agreement in July 1883; he received no reply so he wrote again in March 1885, when Buconjić was supposed to visit Rome and settle the issue. That May, the General's deputy Andrea Lupori replied, asking Buconjić to take with him the contract about the parishes he signed and the definitors of the Custody. The Custody decided Begić should follow Buconjić to Rome with the instruction the Franciscans should retain the parishes west of the Neretva River while the bishop should dispose of those on the eastern bankj; in the case this would not be accepted, Begić was instructed to give in \\"as least as possible\\". Buconjić and Begić arrived in Rome on 12 May 1885. The Propoganga received Begić's request in June 1885 and they informed the State Secretariate about the issue. Secretary of State Cardinal Luigi Jacobini asked Nuncio Cardinal Serafino Vannutelli in Vienna to ask Buconjić about the parishes the Franciscans were supposed to retain and those that were at his disposal. In December 1885, Vannutelli asked Buconjić whether he agreed with the Begić's proposal or to write which parishes the Franciscans should retain and which should be at his disposal. In January 1886, Buconjić informed Vannutelli he would not take the parishes from the Franciscans. Upon receiving Buconjić's answer, Vannutelli informed Jacobini the agreement between the Franciscans and Buconjić should not be confirmed and that the parishes should be divided as in Bosnia, where the situation was the same as in Herzegovina. Vannutelli proposed at least one third of the parishes should be under the disposal of the bishop but because Buconjić was a Franciscan himself, Vannutelli considered it would be impossible to bring a new solution and that the Herzegovinian Custos should be informed Rome did not want to make any new decrees because there was a harmony between the bishop and the monks. Jacobini accepted Vannutelli's position. Thus, Rome kept the issue unresolved. Friar Lujo Radoš fruitlessly urged the Congregation for Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs in March 1888. Lupori advised Friar Nikola Šimović to explain the Franciscans' position on the matter to the Nuncio in Vienna and to try to get a confirmation for their proposal. At the end of October 1889, he visited the Nuncio, who told him he would try to resolve the matter in the interest of the Franciscans. After returning to Mostar, Šimović again wrote to the Nuncio, reminding him of Radoš's proposal from 1888. The Nuncio replied in December 1889, promising to support such a proposal. The issue, however, remained unresolved for years. In 1892, the Franciscan Custody of Herzegovina was elevated to a province. After Begić was elected Provincial in 1898, he tried to broker any deal he could, rather than to hold the insecure status quo. Buconjić was supposed to visit Rome after Easter in 1899, which Begić saw as an opportunity to resolve the issue of parishes. Custos Rafael Radoš was supposed to join Buconjić in Rome but he died in March 1899. In April that year, Begić wrote to the General of the Order to represent the Franciscan Province in Herzegovina. Buconjić discussed the issue with Begić; both men wanted to preserve the strong Franciscan presence in the Diocese of Mostar-Duvno. Buconjić proposed 25 parishes should belong to the Franciscans while 12 would be at the bishop's disposal. Buconjić also proposed the establishment of 12 additional parishes that would be at the bishop's disposal. Pope Leo XIII confirmed the Decisia on 17 July 1899; 14 parishes were designated to the diocesan clergy while others were left to the Franciscans. Buconjić postponed the publication of the pope's decision until 1908; both Buconjić and the Franciscans were unsatisfied with the decision. The beginning of this publication states; \\"We considered it adequate to present before the eyes of the priests of our dioceses, and especially to the young ones, the copies of the solemn Decisia in relation to the parishes established or those ought to be established. This Decisia must remain solid and constant to avoid any dissent or changeability of wishes.\\" He asked the pope for permission to trust certain dioceses to the Franciscans because he lacked the diocesan priests. With time, however, the Deceisa remained neither solid nor constant and \\"the dissent and changeability of wishes\\" were not avoided. The will of Buconjić about the division of the parishes was not respected.  Apostolic Administrator of Trebinje-Mrkan  Provicar of Trebinje-Mrkan Lazar Lazarević The Diocese of Trebinje-Mrkan suffered heavily during the Herzegovina uprising between 1875 and 1877; many Catholics and priests fled the area, and houses and churches were destroyed. At the time, Trebinje-Mrkan was administered by the Bishop of Dubrovnik. After the Austrian-Hungarian occupation, the situation improved and the refugees returned to their homes. The churches and schools were renovated and rebuilt, and the number of Catholics in the territory increased. During the talks about the organization of the Church in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Governor of Dalmatia General Gavrilo Rodić and Bishop of Dubrovnik Ivan Zaffron opposed the idea Trebinje-Mrkan should be exempted from the Bishop of Dubrovnik but the Catholic population and clergy wanted their own bishop. Zaffron later supported the initiative and proposed Apostolic Vicar of Egypt Bishop Ljudevit Ćurčija as a new bishop of Trebinje-Mrkan. The Austrian-Hungarian government, however, could not meet these requests due to financial obligations and the consideration for the Eastern Orthodox. The government could not allow the Catholics, who were fewer in numbers, to have more bishops than the Eastern Orthodox so they agreed in the Convention of 1881 to leave Trebinje-Mrkan under the administration of the bishop of Dubrovnik. The Catholics of Trebinje-Mrkan became frustrated with the lack of material aid from the new authorities and the inactivity of the new Bishop of Dubrovnik Mato Vodopić. Buconjić systematically usurped northern and north-eastern parts of the Diocese of Trebinje-Mrkan for his own diocese of Mostar-Duvno. According to Ex hac augusta, the borders of the Diocese of Mostar-Duvno reached Novi Pazar while the northern border between the Dioceses of Mostar-Duvno and Trebinje- Mrkan remained unclear. Provicar of Trebinje-Mrkan Lazar Lazarević wrote to the Propaganda in Rome on 11 June 1887, again requesting the appointment of a new bishop and protection of Catholics from the new authorities. In mid-1887, Lazarević also wrote to the Austrian-Hungarian government in Sarajevo about Buconjić's encroachment in Trebinje-Mrkan but his petition drew no positive response. Lazarević also warned Vodopić about his duties as Apostolic Administrator but Vodopić showed little interest. Head of the Propaganda Cardinal Giovanni Simeoni asked the State Secretary Cardinal Mariano Rampolla to help with the improvement of the condition of Catholics in Trebinje-Mrkan. Rampolla informed the pope about the situation; the pope requested new negotiations with the Austrian-Hungarian government. Cardinal Luigi Galimberti, the new Nuncio in Vienna, started negotiations with Foreign Minister Count Gustav Kálnoky and showed him Rampolla's letter. Kálnoky informed the Minister of Finances Béni Kállay about the situation and in June 1888, Kállay ordered an investigation into the Buconjić's pretensions to Trebinje-Mrkan. On 5 September 1888, the clergy of Trebinje-Mrkan again asked Nuncio Galimberti for the new bishop and for Buconjić to respects the boundaries of Trebinje-Mrkan as established in the 1881 bull Ex hac augusta. On 17 June 1889, the Austrian-Hungarian government in Sarajevo and the Joint Ministry of Finance presented their proposal to Galimberti, in which they suggested the Bishop of Mostar-Duvno should administer Trebinje-Mrkan. The main motive for the proposal was not to dissatisfy the Eastern Orthodox population. The Austrian-Hungarian government also requested the Bishop of Mostar-Duvno, even though just an apostolic administrator, should have a regular jurisdiction in Trebinje-Mrkan and that he could appoint Franciscans to priestly duties. Cardinals Simeoni and Rampolla agreed with the first proposal but rejected the others. The Austrian-Hungarian government was informed about their decision on 23 September 1889. On 16 June 1890, the Propaganda decreed the bishop of Mostar-Duvno would administer Trebinje-Mrkan and the pope confirned this decision on 8 July the same year. With the new decree, Buconjić's jurisdiction was extended to the whole of Herzegovina.  Succession and death  Alojzije Mišić succeeded Buconjić as Bishop of Mostar- Duvno and Apostolic Administrator of Trebinje-Mrkan In the last years of his life, Buconjić was often sickly. Even though the new episcopal residence was erected, Buconjoć refused to move and lived in the old residence in Vukodol. His advisor Friar Radoslav Glavaš, the bishop's secretary, used Buconjić's weak condition to remain in power and kept him uninformed and thus dependent. Glavaš directed the financial resources of the diocese to the Franciscan Province of Herzegovina and no decisive steps could be expected in the dioceses. This was noticed by the Archbishop of Sarajevo Josip Stadler, who, with the aim of improving the situation in the dioceses, asked Rome to appoint his auxiliary bishop Ivan Šarić as Bishop Coadjutor of Mostar-Duvno with the right of succession. The new Joint Finance Minister Stephan Burián von Rajecz, a Hungarian nationalist, did not support the appointment of clergy that were not close to Hungary and thus disapproved of Šarić's appointment. The authorities supported the Franciscans and Šarić undiplomatically explained to the government in Vienna he should be appointed because there were no good candidates among the Herzegovinian Franciscans, Burián ordered a candidate for Buconjić's replacement be found among the Bosnian Franciscans. Influential members of the Austrian-Hungarian government in Sarajevo concluded Alojzije Mišić, a former Hungarian student and a person of trust of the pro-Hungarian members of the government in Sarajevo, should be the new bishop in Mostar. On 19 February 1910, the Sarajevo government proposed Mišić for the post of Bishop Coadjutor in Mostar but the government in Vienna postponed the decision for a few months due to the preparations for the imperial visit to Bosnia and Herzegovina. Buconjić saw the proposals for the bishop coadjutor as his own dismissal and staunchly opposed them. Buconjić's stance so annoyed the elder Herzegovinian Franciscans the new Provincial Luka Begić proposed himself as the bishop coadjutor during Emperor Franz Joseph's stay in Mostar on 3 June 1910.. Buconjić, learning about the intentions of the governments in Sarajevo and Vienna, and Begić's proposal to the emperor, wrote to Pope Pius X and proposed Frano Lulić, a Dalmatian Franciscan; and two Herzegovinian Franciscans Špiro Špirić and David Nevistić, as candidates for his successor. Buconjić became disappointed with the Herzegovinian Franciscans, who saw his first choice, a Dalmatian Lulić, as an insult. After being warned only the emperor had the right of appointment, and the Pope of confirmation, Buconjić proposed the same candidates to Franz Joseph and asked him for the appointment of the bishop coadjutor. The government in Sarajevo considered Lulić to be unfit because he was living in Rome and as a Dalmatian would not handle a Herzegovinian diocese. The Austrian-Hungarian authorities were repulsed by anyone from Rome and who did not adopt the monarchy's liberal policies of Josephinism. The government in Sarajevo considered Mišić to be more qualified than the other two candidates. The government in Vienna informed Rome about its intention to name Mišić as the bishop coadjutor but Rome was balanced between the suggestions of the Austrian-Hungarian authorities and of Buconjić, and opted to wait until Buconjić's death to resolve the issue. Buconjić died in Mostar on 8 December 1910 and was buried in the city's Church of Saint Peter and Paul. As requested by the canon law, on 19 December 1910, the Metropolitan Archbishop Stadler named Lazar Lazarević administrator in spiritual matters of the two Herzegovinian dioceses. The material care of the dioceses was given to Glavaš, who used his position to further enrich the Franciscan Province of Herzegovina. He informed the government in Vienna about his appointments and proposed Ivan Šarić, Tomo Igrc and Ivan Dujmušić as candidates for the new bishop in Mostar, noting he also considered Herzegovinian Franciscans but in his conscientiousness could not propose any of them. His proposals were quickly dismissed because the Austrian-Hungarian authorities preferred Franciscans over diocesan clergy and wanted a Franciscan to be the new bishop. Even though Rome supported Buconjić's first choice Lulić, after his death, the Austrian-Hungarian authorities did not consider Lulić a serious candidate. Rome did not support Vienna's choice of Mišić because of his conflict with Archbishop Stadler and started to seek its own candidates. After the friction about the candidates for bishop in Mostar, the Austrian-Hungarian authorities officially proposed Mišić to Rome for the post for the second time on 5 January 1912. The pope accepted the proposal so Burián asked the emperor to appoint Mišić, which the emperor did on 14 February. The pope proclaimed Mišić the new bishop on 29 April 1912. During the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1992, Serb forces destroyed Buconjić's tombstone and the Church of Saint Peter and Paul. His remains were transferred to a cemetery in Šoinovac.

Originally incorporated as Endomagnetics Ltd, the company was founded in 2007 and produces surgical guidance products which assist surgeons in locating and removing cancerous tumors, predominantly for breast cancer surgery. The company's products are distributed by Leica Biosystems in North America and Sysmex Corporation across Europe. The company's location at the St John's Innovation Park in Cambridge is central to Silicon Fen, the cluster of high-tech businesses in the area which form one of the most important technology centres in Europe. History Endomag was founded in 2007 as Endomagnetics Ltd as a University spin-off from University College London and the University of Houston. Helped by initial seed money from UCL Business, Endomag has continued to develop its magnetic sensing technologies to improve minimally invasive procedures for oncologists. In June 2014, the company acquired the magnetic hyperthermia assets of the US-based Actium Biosystems. In 2015, the company moved offices from Cambridge Science Park to its current headquarters at The Jeffrey's Building on the St John's Innovation Park. The office was opened by Lord Sainsbury. In July 2018, the company announced a further round of venture capital funding, a Series C for $10m (£8m) led by Draper Esprit, the European arm of Silicon Valley investor, Tim Draper's venture capital business. Technologies Endomag's Sentimag probe is a sensitive magnetometer which detects either an implantable magnetic marker, Magseed, or an injectable superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle tracer, branded Magtrace. The Magseed marker is placed in a tumor under imaging guidance prior to surgery, and located and removed during surgery. The company's magnetic probe can indicate the distance from the Magseed marker, which helps guide the surgical excision of the cancerous tumor. The Magtrace liquid marker is injected near the tumor prior to surgery and migrates to the lymph nodes draining the primary tumour, the so-called ‘sentinel’ nodes. These can then be detected and excised during a sentinel lymph node biopsy procedure. The company's products are a radiation-free alternative for breast cancer surgeons. Endomag's Magseed marker product has received FDA 510(k) clearance for localizing tumors in soft tissue in 2016 and its Magtrace and Sentimag Magnetic Localization System received FDA premarket approval (PMA) in 2018 to identify and remove sentinel lymph nodes in women undergoing mastectomy for breast cancer. Awards The company has won a number of business, engineering and science awards since its inception. In 2015, the company was shortlisted for the MacRobert Award, a leading UK engineering award. The following year saw Endomag awarded with an Institute of Physics Commended Innovation award. In 2018, Endomag received a Queen's Awards for Enterprise in the Innovation category. In July 2018, the company was presented this award by Julie Spence OBE, the current Lord Lieutenant of Cambridgeshire. In October 2018 the company received a Business Innovation Award from the Institute of Physics for its use of magnetism for minimally invasive surgical guidance.

Since 1995, Berman has held a number of key roles at JAKKS, turning the organization into one of the largest toy marketers and manufacturers in the United States. In the main, JAKKS creates, manufactures and markets toys via licenses with well-known brands. He is responsible for designing and manufacturing toys for The Walt Disney Company, Warner Bros., Activision, NBCUniversal, Microsoft, and Nintendo. Career Berman started his career in the fitness industry, where he had his first success as an entrepreneur. He owned a successful fitness company based in Woodland Hills, California, which was known as Balanced Approach Inc.. He then held a notable role at THQ International and served as their Managing Director between 1991 and 1995. During this time, the company grew as both a video game company and also toy manufacturer. Following the acquisition of Black Pearl Software, THQ International began to focus more heavily on video gaming rather than toys. When he reached his early 30s, he had amassed a reasonable fortune and decided he wanted to try something new. He spoke with Jack Friedman about starting a new toy company. As THQ had recently moved out of the market, they believed there was a gap in the market that needed to be filled. Friedman and Berman then co-founded Jakks Pacific in 1995. Over the next 4 years, Berman and his co-founder grew JAKKS into one of the most promising toy startups in the US. The reason for its rapid success was partnerships with a number of major brands. The most notable at the time was Berman's agreement with the WWE, to produce wrestling-related toys on behalf of the organization. The agreement was for 14-years in total, meaning that Berman could use it as a springboard to rapidly grow the business. In those 4 years, he grew JAKKS Pacific from a new company to $85 million in revenue. Over half of that revenue came from wrestling toys and its partnership with WWE. Not only were revenues high, but also profits when compared to other toy marketers and manufacturers. They were one of the first US-based toy companies to mass produce their inventory overseas and make large savings using that strategy. Due to the rapid growth of JAKKS Pacific, Berman was recognized as Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year in 2001 in the distribution category. Over the next decade, Berman was responsible for signing numerous partnerships, which made JAKKS a major toy manufacturer and marketer in the United States. During this period he was the company's Chief Operating Officer. In 2002, he also served as President of Toymax International, after it was acquired by JAKKS Pacific. The Los Angeles Times reported that the deal was worth $54 million. Toymax subsequently became a subsidiary of JAKKS. He currently holds the position of Chairman at JAKKS Pacific. Philanthropy Berman is responsible for creating JAKKS Cares, part of the philanthropic arm of JAKKS Pacific. JAKKS Cares and other foundations have been responsible for giving over $50 million in monetary gifts to children's charities and have also partnered with the NBA to provide children and less fortunate fans with basketball toys. Awards Berman's achievements in the toy and entertainment markets have led him to be recognized as Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year in 2001 and also win other awards from Variety (magazine) and vendors Target, Walmart, and Toys R Us. Personal life Berman has three children, Ariana, Logan and Sienna Berman.

Early life  Gatteys grew up in Dallas, Texas. The unusual spelling of her first name is because her parents originally wanted a boy. At the age of two she sang in her church's choir. By the age of eight she began studying piano and sought to become a concert pianist. At age 15, visiting a friend in New York City, she appeared on a game show, Name That Tune, during which she won $19,000 after a series of appearances.  Career  Gatteys' career in musical theater was jump-started when she was discovered at the age of 15 by Broadway producer Kermit Bloomgarden, who cast her in a production of The Diary of Anne Frank as the understudy of Susan Strasberg, who played Anne Frank. Her first big break in television came at the age of 16, during her appearance in the television anthology series Look Up and Live, in which she co-starred opposite a then- teenaged Warren Beatty. During the short-lived series, Beatty and Gatteys formed a strong connection; Gatteys recalled Beatty walking her home from rehearsals and shoots and described him as her \\"big brother, friend, [and] companion\\". She helped him read for a starring role in the Broadway musical Ohio. She eventually married a banker from Texas and returned to Dallas for seven years, during which time her career remained dormant. After her divorce, she moved to Los Angeles to restart her acting career in soap operas, including a starring role in Days Of Our Lives as Susan Martin. Her career continued largely in the field of theater, soap operas, and occasional variety and game shows, until she retired from show business in 1977.

Murphey's father, Dr. Abraham D. Murphey, a physician, developed the liquid antiperspirant to help surgeons with sweaty hands. Edna subsequently found this antiperspirant useful on underarms and began marketing the product to women. There had been other previous deodorant/antiperspirant inventions previous to Murphey's, however, Murphey's was the product that became widely distributed. Murphy called the deodorant, Odorono (Odor-o-no) and started the company Odorono Co. At the time, antiperspirant products were not widely used, and Murphey was, for the most part, unsuccessful at selling the product in the office she rented in Cincinnati. Many potential users thought the item was either unnecessary, potentially harmful to their health, or that the red color of the product would damage their clothing. Odorono began selling after Murphey took the product to Atlantic City in 1912 for a Summer long exposition. Subsequently, Murphey began advertising the product in newspapers in major cities. In 1918, Murphey took out at US$50,000 bank loan, and hired James Webb Young of the J. Walter Thompson (JWT) agency to create a national advertising campaign for Odorono. Early advertisements focused on addressing the idea that the product was unhealthy, the ads stressed that the product had been developed by a doctor and was safe for daily use. Then, after JWT employee James Young conducted a survey on why women were not buying the product, Young discovered that most women did not have a need for the deodorant. Thus, in 1919, Odorono switched its advertising strategy to convince people that sweating was an embarrassing problem, and as a result of this campaign, Odorono sales rose 112 percent. The first ad created with this strategy appeared in Ladies' Home Journal. By 1921, Odo-ro-no (the name was updated to represent pronunciation of the word) was advertised in newspapers in England, Cuba, Mexico, The Philippines, Chile, Peru, Ecuador, Brazil, Argentina, New Zealand, Australia, and South Africa. In 1929, Murphey sold the company to Northam Warren, the inventor of the Cutex Cuticle Remover. Murphey is credited with creating the now 18 billion dollar deodorant market industry.  Medical concerns  As in most antiperspirants of the time, the active ingredient of Odorono was aluminum chloride. As such, the solution irritated underarms and in 1913 the American Medical Association (AMA) determined it was likely to clog the pores in the underarm. To avoid this side effect, customers were advised to avoid shaving prior to use and to apply the product before bed so that the product would fully dry and would not stain or damage clothing.

Feigenbaum was an associate editor of the Yiddish language papers The Forward, its predecessor Di Arbeter Tsaytung, and the literary monthly Di Tsukunft and a pioneer of the Socialist Party of America. During the Jewish Holiday of Yom Kippur in 1899, Feigenbaum famously said in alternative event \\"If there is a God and if he is Almighty as the clergy claims he is, I give him just two minutes’ time to kill me on the spot, so that he may prove his existence!\\" after two minutes he declared \\"See! There is no God!\\". Afterwards he announced a location for the workers to eat instead of fasting, as traditionally done during Yom Kippur.  Early life  Benjamin Feigenbaum was born to a prominent Chassidic family in Warsaw, Poland. He went to Yeshivah, but became a free-thinker. According to a colleague, Israel Joshua Singer, Feigenbaum's \\"conversion\\" to secularism happened when his teacher, the Gerer rebbe, discovered that Feigenbaum was not wearing tsitsit, a ritual garb. The rebbe beat him as a punishment. Later on, he moved to Belgium; there he attended his first socialist protest in Antwerp in 1884. On December 25, 1886, his wife Matilda (Kaminsky) Feigenbaum gave birth to their son William Morris Feigenbaum. He had a total of 2 daughters and 2 sons named Kanin, R. Ganetkin, William and Henry.  Career  As a young socialist in 1887, Feigenbaum considered starting a socialist Yiddish newspaper. To his delight, he discovered the London-based Arbeter Fraynd recently started. He wrote them immediately. Towards the end of 1888, Feigenbaum moved to London, UK with his wife, to join their editorial board. In 1891, Feigenbaum immigrated to New York, to work on New York's first Yiddish-language socialist newspaper, Di Arbeter Tsaytung (The Workman's Paper). He co-founded the Workmen's Circle, serving as its first General-Secretary. In New York, Feigenbaum developed a relationship with Bolesław Miklaszewski, a representative of the London affiliate of the Polish Socialist Party (PPS) called the Union of Polish Socialists Abroad (ZZSP). After vetting Feigenbaum's circles to ensure they did not have \\"a gravitational pull\\" to Russia, ZZSP announced creation of \\"Jewish Socialist Post from America to Poland\\" in 1896, to publish and disseminate Yiddish socialist literature.  Police retaliation  Feigenbaum was arrested during a brawl with the police on October 29, 1892, shortly after giving a speech in Philadelphia. He was charged with inciting to riot, assaulting an officer and breaching the peace after allegedly hitting an officer with his cane. He was held on $600 bail. In Providence he was charged with inciting to riot, which were later dismissed by a Judge during trial in a higher court. In January, 1905, Providence police received a tip that an \\"anarchist provocateur\\" was scheduled to speak. Police surrounded the designated venue, disabling gas and cited lack of permit for as reason for shutting it down. The sponsors of the lecture, the Providence branch of Workmen's Circle obtained permits and scheduled another venue for Feigenbaum to speak at. If Hyman Goldsmith, a Yiddish speaking undercover police patrolman heard Feigenbaum mention anything about “Emma Goldmanism” or “bomb throwing” the hall would be cleared immediately by other undercover police in crowd. Instead, Feigenbaum orated for two hours and 15 minutes about the compatibility of religion and socialism, in contrast with his earlier recitals. The police were ridiculed the following day by The Daily Journal, The Evening Bulletin, and The Providence Telegram.  Criticism of Zionism and religion  Feigenbaum was highly critical of Zionism and the usage of biblical scriptures to promoting socialist spiritualization. In his Yiddish article, 'Materialism in Judaism or Religion and Life' (1896), Feigenbaum criticized using the Bible as 'propaganda'. If Jeremiah did not know Marx, then it was disingenuous to claim that Marxism is part of a prophetic tradition. In 'Vi Kumt a yid tsu sotsyialismus' (How does a Jew come to socialism?) Feigenbaum writes \\"Yes, brothers, socialism is redemption for us, the Jews. Socialism will rescue all the unfortunate people, Jews as well, and give them equal rights...Socialism's victory would spell the only effective defeat of the forces of anti-Semitism\\". He further maintains that he met socialist Gentiles who ridded themselves of anti-Semitism upon discovering socialism. The enemy is the capitalist, whether Gentile or Jewish; and the Jewish poor are his friend. Feigenbaum rejected Zionism as utopian and urged Jews to reject notion of Goles as exile from Palestine, but rather state of persecution, from which socialism can redeem them. Death Feigenbaum died on the morning of November 10, 1932 in the Home for Incurables in New York. He had been ill for the previous ten years, the last three of which he was paralyzed. Funeral services were held in Forward Hall, on November 13, 1932. Feigenbaum is currently buried in the Workmen’s Circle section of Mount Carmel Cemetery, in Queens, New York.

A plan for redevelopment of the area was created when the city's bastioned fortifications were decommissioned in the 1850s. The site was initially intended for a new church but the Isaiah Church was ultimately built a little further to the west. The old site was instead laid out as a public space with the name Stockholms Plads. It was renamed Hjalmar Brantings Plads in 1925. Design The shape of the square has been determined by the shape of the bastion that was formerly located at the site and remains of it has been reused in the design of its central garden complex. Buildings The building is to the northeast and southwest flanked by high-end apartment buildings. They were both built in 1894-97 to design by Andreas Clemmensen. Grant Thornton is based at No. 1. The square is to the northwest separated from the Cemetery of Holmen by a row of large villas. No. 6 is built in the National Romantic style with exposed timber framing on the upper floor. The company Peter Jahn & Partnere is now based in the building. No. 8 was built for the industrialist M. A. Heegaard in 1899-1901 to design by Ulrik Plesner.

History The Mile Rock Tunnel started construction in 1914 and was completed by 1915. The contract was initially awarded to Edward Malley, but he stopped work after five months because of the high cost of insurance; R.C. Storrie and Company, who were responsible for other large tunneling projects including the Twin Peaks Tunnel, assumed responsibility for the work in January 1915. Mayor 'Sunny Jim' Rolph and other officials, including City Engineer M.M. O'Shaughnessy performed an inspection of the completed tunnel using a car on August 26, 1915. The tunnel was fitted with temporary structures and lighting to allow the car to enter without the threat of flooding from the outlet, but as it was not wide enough to allow the car to turn around, the return trip was conducted in reverse gear. Design The tunnel was constructed by a combination of cut-and-cover (through soil) and boring (through rock) methods.

Constituent bands  = Central Band of the NPA Land Forces = The Central Band of the NVA Land Forces (also known as the Central Band of the NPA, Zentralorchester der NVA) was no reorganization such as the Stabsmusikkorps of the Bundeswehr, but it was taken over in 1956 by the KVP and at this time could look back on a seven -year history as a symphony orchestra or symphonic wind band. Of all the active bands, it was the most senior band of the entire NPA. The development of the Band ran until 1959 in normal tracks and without special features. Then Major Gerhard Baumann, former director of the Schwerin People's Police Band, came to Berlin via Leipzig and took over the leadership of the ZO from the hands of Major Hans-Helmut Hunger. In the \\"era Baumann\\", which lasted until 1983, the Central Band of the NVA became a term for solid military music and an extraordinary ensemble of sound. However, the uniqueness of the orchestra was not based solely on its position as the largest and most important music corps of military music of the NVA, because the official music - up to extraordinary representative performances - was, as with all top brass corps of a state, integrated into predetermined framework conditions, albeit Here, of course, his style and the treatment of the profession not only make the connoisseur sit up. In 1983, Colonel Gerhard Baumann handed over the baton to Heinz Häcker, who led the ZO until the time of reunification. The fate of the ZO was ultimately no different than that of the NVA as a whole. As a full blown Bundeswehr band in its final months the central band was disbanded under its last director, Major Bernd Zivny, who performed the band's final Berlin concert on 2 November 1990, the only time it performed wearing Bundeswehr uniforms as part of the unification of the band services of the former two Germanies, it was rebadged briefly as the local band for the now reunified Berlin city garrison. = Band of the National People's Navy = The Band of the National People's Navy (Musikkorps der Volksmarine) was the only band supporting the ceremonial activities of the Volksmarine. = Central Band of the National People's Army Air Forces = The Central Band of the National People's Army Air Forces (Orchester der Luftstreitkräfte der Nationalen Volksarmee) supported the ceremonial activities of the Air Forces of the National People's Army, and reported thus to the Kommando LSK/LV in East Berlin. = Band of the Border Troops = The Band of the Border Troops of the German Democratic Republic (Orchester der Grenztruppen der DDR) was the official band supporting the ceremonial activities of the Border Troops of the German Democratic Republic, a directly reporting agency of the Ministry of National Defense.

The ship was designed and built as a bulk carrier, but was wrecked on her maiden voyage. Design and construction In late 1890s Albert Ellis, who worked for the Pacific Islands Company Ltd, discovered rich phosphate rock deposits on several Pacific islands, including Nauru and Makatea. Soon, the Pacific Islands Company was transformed into the Pacific Phosphate Company, with their founders Baron Stanmore and John T. Arundel investing into phosphate trade and establishing a virtual monopoly on phosphate shipments to both Australia and New Zealand. Mining started in 1906 in Nauru, and the company needed more vessels to transport the cargo. Ocean Queen was laid down at William Gray & Co. shipyard in West Hartlepool and launched on 8 December 1908 (yard number 760), with Miss Arundel, of Kensington serving as a sponsor. After successful completion of sea trials on 10 February 1909 Ocean Queen was handed over to her owners on the same day. The ship was able to achieve and maintain an average speed of during the sea trials. The vessel was primarily intended as a bulk carrier, designed to the specifications of the Pacific Phosphate Company Ltd, but also accommodations for a large number of first and second-class passengers in houses on the spar deck were built. Additionally, electric lighting, refrigerating machinery, and cold chambers, and the ventilation were installed to suit the tropical climate where it was intended to operate the vessel. As built, the ship was long between perpendiculars and abeam, a mean draft of . Ocean Queen was assessed at and . The vessel had a steel hull, and a single 348 nhp triple-expansion steam engine, with cylinders of , and diameter with a stroke, that drove a single screw propeller, and moved the ship at up to . Operational history After delivery Ocean Queen was immediately sent to the Pacific and left Hartlepool on February 26. The ship called off at Antwerpen to load some machinery to be delivered to several mining locations in the South Pacific, and Plymouth which she departed on March 10, 1909. The ship passed Cape Town on April 7, eventually arriving in Sydney on May 4. Among the passengers arriving from England on the vessel there were John T. Arundel, his private secretary and his three daughters, Dorothy, Lilian, and Sydney Arundel. Ocean Queen was scheduled for a five- month long voyage, visiting Ocean Island, Pleasant Island, several islands adjacent to Tahiti where a new venture was to be opened, and also envisioned a visit to Honolulu. After loading general cargo for the islands and 1,200 tons of coal, the vessel departed Sydney on May 26. After calling at island ports, Ocean Queen loaded phosphates at Ocean Island and sailed on to Hawaii arriving at Honolulu on July 23. The vessel left Hawaii in early August and took course to Tahiti and Makatea, and from there she was scheduled to visit Nauru on October 5 to take her first load of phosphate for Australia. =Sinking= Ocean Queen departed Papeete under command of Captain Christian Johanessen on September 15, 1909. She arrived in view of Makatea around 07:00 in the morning of September 16. The ship was flying full colors in observance of King Edward VII's birthday, and went around to the eastern side of the island of Makatea, close to the settlement of Maumu, instead of the weather shore where she was supposed to deliver her cargo. At around 10:30, while parading herself to the locals, the eccentric rod bent and jammed her engines, rendering them useless. A strong current, present on the lee side of Makatea, carried the vessel towards the shore, throwing and grounding her on the reefs about twenty minutes later. Around 13:00, after all attempts to repair the engines were unsuccessful and seeing the deteriorating condition of the vessel, the captain ordered everybody to abandon ship. Lifeboats were lowered, and the crew and all passengers left the ship in orderly fashion. At approximately 20:00, after developing several holes in her bottom and sides from all the pounding on the rocks, Ocean Queen slid off the reef into the sea and sank in of water. A boat was sent to Tahiti, and two schooners, Susanne and Cholita were dispatched the next day to pick up the crew and the passengers from Makatea. Upon arrival in Papeete, they boarded steamer SS Mariposa and sailed to San Francisco.

Thomas Bradbury Chandler in the Light of his (Unpublished) Diary 1775-85), Church History Vol. 1 (1932) p.90 et seq.Appleton's Cyclopedia vol. I, pp. 573-574. Early life Son of Capt. William J. Chandler and his wife Jamima Bradbury, Thomas Chandler was born at Woodstock, Connecticut in 1726, into a large family, with brothers William, Lemuel, Theophilus, Jemimah and Samuel and several sisters. He was educated at Yale College, where he joined the Church of England and came under the influence of Samuel Johnson and Timothy Cutler. In 1748, after teaching as discussed below, Chandler received a master's degree from Yale, and graduated alongside Samuel Seabury and future U.S. Senator William Samuel Johnson of New York, with whom he later often corresponded. His classmate's father, Rev. Samuel Johnson became his mentor as a clergyman, and Chandler later wrotea biography of the New York cleric that his own son-in-law published. In 1851 Chandler sailed across the Atlantic Ocean to study at Oxford University, and received an honorary doctorate from that institution in 1767.Gavin pp. 90-91 He married Jane Chandler, and had a son, William Chandler, as well as daughters Mary Rickets Chandler, Elizabeth Chandler, Catherine Chandler Dayton, Jane Tongerlon Chandler and Mary Goodin Chandler. The last, his youngest daughter, married missionary priest John Henry Hobart, who, after his father-in-law's death, published his Life of Samuel Johnson, and himself became Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of New York. Ministry After his initial graduation in 1745, Chandler taught school while studying for the ministry. The Society for Propagating the Gospel in Foreign Parts (SPG) appointed him lay reader and catechist in New Jersey, as his mentor Rev. Samuel Johnson was serving across the river in New York City. In 1747, Chandler succeeded Rev. Edward Vaughan, who had died, as a mission priest in New Jersey, and made Elizabeth, New Jersey his base. Initially, New Jersey had been populated and governed under two different auspices. The southern portion was initially granted to William Penn and descendants, and was governed through Burlington, New Jersey, and less directly from Philadelphia. What was known as East Jersey was initially granted to Lord Carteret, but early in the 18th century bought by other Quakers. It was governed through Perth Amboy, but also had relations with the priests and garrison chaplains of New York City. In 1751, Chandler sailed to and from England, where he completed his studies and was ordained a priest by the Bishop of London (then responsible for priests in the American colonies) as well as installed as rector of St. John's church in Elizabeth, New Jersey. Upon returning to New Jersey, Rev. Chandler became \\"one of the foremost men among the American clergy.\\"Gavin citing Perry, A History of the American Episcopal Church (Boston 1885) vol. I p. 168. He continued to work extensively with the SPG and became its bursar in North America. Chandler also corresponded extensively with fellow Anglicans in North America, including fellow Connecticut priest Samuel Seabury and Irish immigrant Rev. Charles Inglis (rector of Trinity Church on Wall Street in New York City). Chandler wrote to England concerning the unwisdom of the Stamp Act in 1766 and the lack of wisdom of Parliament's measures for governing the colonies, and urged creation of a North American Episcopate. Responding to an address by the Bishop of Gloucester to the SPG in 1766, Rev. Chandler published Appeal to the Public in Behalf of the Church of England in America in New York in 1767.https://jrul.libraries.rutgers.edu/index.php/jrul/article/viewFile/1255/2692 This drew attacks from Congregational and Presbyterian Church members, as well as newspapers in New York, Philadelphia and Boston. Prominent Congregational clergyman Dr. Charles Chauncy published The Appeal Answered, to which Chandler responded with The Appeal Defended (1769) and The Appeal Further Defended (1771) after Chauncy's Compleat View of Episcopay continued to oppose creation of an Anglican bishopric in the American colonies. Rev. Inglis also published a pamphlet supporting a North American-based bishop. In 1771, American churchmen sent Dr. Myles Cooper (Rev. Johnson's successor at Columbia College) to England to lobby for better treatment of the colonial church. However, Rev. Chandler remained in the colony, and became involved in concluding the literary affairs of his mentor, who died in 1772. When the American Revolutionary War broke out, Rev. Chandler's loyalties remained with England, and his eldest son William volunteered and became a Captain in Loyalist forces in October 1776. After threats from the local Sons of Liberty, Chandler sailed to England in May 1775, where he remained for nearly a decade (joining Rev. Cooper and joined by Rev. Inglis in either 1777 and/or 1783). However, his daughter Catherine had married the son of Revolutionary General Elias Dayton (and brother of patriot lawyer Jonathan Dayton) and remained in New Jersey. In addition to his social activities on behalf of fellow Loyalists in England, Rev. Chandler also wrote pamphlets urging loyalty to England, which the Royal Printer printed and Loyalists distributed in the colonies. He also kept a diary which survives but was never published.Gavin pp. 94-100 While in England, Chandler continued to lobby for a bishop residing in North America. He facilitated contacts between non-Juror Dr. Cartwright, who helped negotiate the consecration of his fellow Loyalist and long-time friend Samuel Seabury by Scottish bishops led by Rt.Rev.John Skinner in 1784.Gavin p. 103 In 1785, Chandler accepted his congregation's offer to return to New Jersey. However, a cancer developed on his face which prevented him from many official duties, although the vestry insisted that he remain their rector and live in the rectory even when incapacitated. In fact, the Church of England had offered to make Chandler the first Bishop of Nova Scotia, but he had declined in 1785. His Irish-born friend Charles Inglis thus became the first bishop of the Church of England in North America in 1787, with his seat in Nova Scotia. Despite his medical condition, Chandler continued to write, and the Memorial of the N.J. Convention, which Bishop William White believed Chandler wrote, was used to compile the declaration of intention and the formal creation of the Episcopal Church of the United States in 1789, as well as the authorized Preface of the standard Book of Common Prayer.Gavin p. 105 Death and legacy Chandler died at his home in what was then known as Elizabethtown in 1790. His widow and son-in-law Elias Bailey Dayton were executors and proved his will in 1794. His body was buried in the churchyard of St. John's Episcopal Church (Elizabeth, New Jersey). Chandler is honored with a feast day on the liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA) alongside Rev. Samuel Johnson and Timothy Cutler on August 17. His son-in-law and grandson became bishops and are also remembered on the Episcopal church calendar: John Henry Hobart on September 12 and William Hobart Hare on May 17.

Family Del Giudice was born on 23 November 1888 in Venice; the rower Scipione Del Giudice was his twin brother. Their parents were Vincenzo and Giuditta Del Giudice ( Zuanelli). Rowing career Like some of his brothers, he became a rower for the Venetian rowing club Francesco Querini named for the polar explorer who died in 1900. In 1908, Del Giudice became Italian champion in the coxed four alongside his twin brother; his brother had first won an Italian championship three years earlier. At the 1908 European Championships, the brothers became European champions in the coxed four. In 1909, the twin brothers became Italian champions in coxed four and the eight; that year their younger brother Curzio (1894–1950) was rowing with them in the eight. The 1909 European Rowing Championships were held in Paris and the twins won gold in the coxed four. When the men's eight started, most of the rowers had already been part of the earlier boats that day and the team was beaten by the French who, apart from Gaston Delaplane, rowed their first competition that day; the Italians including the three Del Giudice brothers had to settle for silver. In 1910, the twin brothers became Italian champion in the coxed four. At the 1910 European Rowing Championships in Ostend, they won gold with the coxed four. At the 1911 European Rowing Championships held on Lake Como, the judges had difficulty in deciding on the winner of the coxed four and eventually awarded the gold medal to the Swiss team, with the Italian team including the Del Giudice twins getting silver. With the eight, they won gold at those championships. In 1912, the Italian selection in the men's eight was decided between the two Venetian clubs – Bucintoro and Querini. There was a collision and a scuffle broke out between the rowers. Both clubs were banned from competitions for one year by the Italian Rowing Federation and Italy's Olympic appearance in the eight was cancelled. Architectural career Del Giudice studied at the Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia (Academy of Fine Arts, Venice) from 1901 until he graduated in 1908. He worked for a few years for the Venetian architect Giuseppe Torres. In 1925, Del Giudice designed the ossuary / monument to the fallen of Vidor. In 1929, the Chiesa di Cristo Re (Church of Christ the King) was built to his design on Sant'Erasmo. Del Giudice designed the marketing poster for the 15th international art exhibition at the Venice Biennale (1926) and designed the entrance pavilions which have since been demolished. In 1932 the Marathan Tower was built to his design at the Stadio Olimpico Grande Torino. In 1932, he won the competition for La Spezia Cathedral following La Spezia becoming an episcopal seat in 1927. It was a major commission and he worked on it until 1950 but his designs were never implemented. Instead, in 1956 a new architectural competition was won by Adalberto Libera. Del Giudice died in Venice on 6 December 1957.

It was the parent company of MoviePass. History The company was founded in 1983 by Shmuel BenTov as Software Ben- Tov. It changed its name later that year to The A Consulting Team. The company made its initial public offering in 1997. In 2006, Helios & Matheson Information Technology Ltd., an IT consulting firm based in India, purchased a majority stake in the company. The A Consulting Team changed its name in 2007 to Helios & Matheson North America, to highlight its association with the parent company. The company again changed its name in 2011 to Helios & Matheson Information Technology Inc., to reflect that it was seeking business opportunities worldwide, and then in 2013 to Helios and Matheson Analytics, to reflect that the business had \\"moved beyond IT\\". The company acquired Zone Technologies, maker of the RedZone Map app, in November 2016. Zone founder Ted Farnsworth was appointed chairman of Helios, and then, in January 2017, became Helios's CEO. In August 2017, Helios purchased a majority stake in MoviePass. Helios advanced MoviePass $55 million from December to February 20, 2018. MoviePass then converted the advances from debt to equity. This increased Helios' ownership stake from 62.4 percent to 81.2 percent. Another $35 million in advances converted to capital put Helios at 91.8 percent, allowing for a merger unilaterally initiated by the Helios board. In January 2018 co-founder Stacy Spikes was fired from the company.The cofounder of MoviePass recounts what led to his firing from the company he'd built from the ground up. Business Insider. 13 April 2019. In April 2018, Helios acquired the movie listings website Moviefone from Verizon's digital media subsidiary, Oath Inc. As part of the transaction, Verizon took an equity stake in MoviePass. In March 2018, the board of directors began the process to spin off Zone Technologies to shareholders as a separate, publicly traded company, in hopes that it would allow Helios to focus on its strengths. In April 2018, Helios sold $150 million in stock with $30 million of the shares at $2.75, a discount from the closing market price of $3.83. Most of the proceeds were used to fund MoviePass. With the diluting and discount on the shares, prior investors indicated their unhappiness with the company on Twitter. In May 2018, the company acquired the assets of Emmett Furla Oasis Films plus gain its executives' expertise in making films for a new subsidiary, MoviePass Films with an option to purchase the library. The new company would be 51% owned by Helios and the remainder by EFO. By early August 2018, Helios and Matheson completed the acquisition of Emmett Furla Oasis Films assets for the MoviePass subsidiary, MoviePass Films. In August 2018, the company reported a loss of $100 million in the second quarter of 2018 with the company trading at an implied value of $30 million. In October 2018, the Attorney General of New York opened an investigation into Helios and Matheson Analytics, looking into whether it misled investors about the company's financial situation. With market perception of MoviePass affecting Helios & Matheson's stock value, in October 2018 the company revealed a preliminary plan to spin off its film industry units as MoviePass Entertainment Holdings. The plan calls for a stock dividend of a minority of the holding company's stock allowing Helios to retain a controlling interest and for listing the new company on the NASDAQ or alternative market. The company' stock was delisted on February 12, 2019, from the NASDAQ and moved to OTC Markets. On January 28, 2020, the company filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy and announced plans to liquidate its assets.

The island of Cayenne had earlier been abandoned by the French. Spranger established good relations with the indigenous people and founded plantations of sugarcane and other tropical plants. In 1664 the French returned in force, and Spranger ceded the colony on the best terms he could get. In 1676 the Dutch again captured Cayenne, and later that year the French again regained control. Spranger seems to have been among the Dutch prisoners shipped back to France in 1676. Life =Early years (1610–56)= Daniel Guerin Spranger was born in Holland around 1610. He obtained a contract to provide supplies to the army of Maurice de Nassau in the conquest of Brazil, and spent sixteen year in Dutch Brazil engaged in colonization schemes. He developed extensive trade between Brazil and Amsterdam. When the Portuguese army recovered possession of Brazil in 1654 all the Jews, Portuguese and Dutch, were expelled from the country. =Cayenne (1656–64)= Map of the Island of Cayenne and its surroundings in 1729. North to the right. Spranger obtained a grant from the States General of the Netherlands and established a Dutch colony on Cayenne Island around 1656. Spranger found that the French had abandoned the island. The Jews brought slaves with them, established friendly relations with the indigenous people, and began producing sugar for export. The colony came under the control of the Dutch West India Company. This company looked for suitable colonists, and in particular for Jewish settlers who had experience in tropical products. Several other groups of Jews from Brazil joined Spranger, who introduced sugar cane and indigo which proved very successful. According to Jacques Dutertre in his Histoire générale des Antilles, \\"under Spranger's administration, the island of Cayenne was reputed an El Dorado.\\" In 1658 Spranger made an agreement for prospecting for minerals with commander Balthazar Gerbier, baron Douilly. On 12 September 1659 David Nassy, a refugee from Dutch Brazil, was given a grant by the company's Amsterdam chamber for a Jewish colony separate from the colony around the city of Cayenne. The group of Jewish colonists, mostly refugees from Brazil but some from Amsterdam, were refused permission to disembark on Cayenne by the Protestant governor, Jan Classen Langedijk. He would only let them establish a colony in a swampy area on the mainland. There were about 35 Protestants on the island, who said they would leave the island when their term of service ended if the Portuguese Jews were refused land, since they would bring prosperity. The Indians also said they would welcome the Jews. The governor seems to have yielded to these arguments and allowed the newcomers to settle. The Jews settled in a fertile region named Remire or Irmire on the west of the island. They planted sugarcane, built a sugar mill, and also produced colours from indigo and annatto. They also produced vanilla extract. There was a fort at Remire, and apparently also a synagogue. In 1650 a group of 152 Jews from Livorno arrived, mostly poor people of North African origin. =French take-over (1664)= The plantations were established and Spranger had begun a profitable trade with the Netherlands when the French decided to regain control, despite being at peace with the Netherlands at the time. On 26 February 1664 Alexandre de Prouville de Tracy sailed from La Rochelle, France, with seven ships and 1,200 picked men of the Compagnie de la France équinoxiale. His first stop was in Cayenne, which Guerin Spranger as Dutch commander surrendered to him without opposition on 15 May 1664. Tracy disembarked the new French governor Antoine Lefèbvre de La Barre and his garrison, and left for Martinique. Germán Arciniegas relates, An agreement between Spranger, de Tracy and de la Barre dated 15 March 1664 set out the terms of surrender. It recognized the Dutch rights to lands in the island, and to their guns, ammunition, merchandise, provisions and appurtenances. The French would let the Dutch military march out, drums beating, and would give them and all other inhabitants transport with their goods and slaves to their destination island or country, providing food and drink on the voyage. The inhabitants who remained, including the Jews, would have freedom of religion and full possession of their goods, lands and slaves. If they chose to leave they could sell their land and take their goods and slaves with them. Later career One source says that Spranger moved from Cayenne to Suriname. It seems that some of the Dutch Jews and Protestants were transported to La Rochelle in Suriname, an outpost on the border with French Guiana, and from there some made their way to the \\"Jewish Savannah\\", where there is a region called Cajane (the Dutch form of Cayenne). An undated letter survives from Maurice de Nassau to Godefroi, Comte d'Estrades, perhaps written around 1679. It says that when the French had taken Guiana they had made \\"Quyryn Spranger\\" a prisoner, and brought him to Brest. Maurice asked that he be given his freedom. His comrades had already been released, and he had nothing in the world but his sword. It seems unlikely that Spranger would have been imprisoned from 1664 to 1679. In May 1676 the Dutch under Jacob Binckes occupied Cayenne. The French under Count Jean II d'Estrées recovered the colony on 19 December 1676. The Dutch officers and about 260 colonists were taken as prisoners of war, and were probably taken to Brest. Probably Spranger was among this batch of prisoners.

Built in 1875, it is one of the city's finest examples of residential Carpenter Gothic architecture, and was home to Dr. Mary Blair Moody, one of the first female physicians to practice in the city. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2017. Description and history The Dr. Mary B. Moody House is located in New Haven's eastern Fair Haven Heights neighborhood, on the north side of East Grand Avenue near the top of the eponymous high ground. The house is set on less than one acre of land, fringed at the street by a low stone retaining wall with posts at the entrances. The house is a visually rich wood frame structure, with the irregular massing typical of the Queen Anne period. Dominant features of the 2-1/2 story structure are a three-story tower with a flared pyramidal roof, and a porch that extends across most of the front and one side. Gables are adorned with Stick style elements, and some windows have shallow pointed tops. Mary Blair Moody and her husband on the porch of the house. The house was built in 1875, and was the home of Lucius and Dr. Mary Blair Moody from the 1880s until the early 20th century. Lucius Moody was an insurance executive, and Mary Moody was the first female to attend the University of Buffalo (now SUNY Buffalo) Medical School, graduating in 1876. Contrary to typical Victorian expectations, she then engaged in a career as a physician, while also raising a family. She was one of the first female physicians in New Haven. The house suffered some wind damage in Hurricane Sandy in 2012, and a Federal disaster relief grant of $150,000 was used to fix the roof and gutters.

Education  Anderson is from Arizona. She earned a Bachelors in physics from Arizona State University in 2000. She moved to the New Mexico State University for her doctoral studies and graduated in 2006. Upon graduation she became a NASA Postdoctoral Fellow.  Career  Dr. Anderson is a planetary astronomer in the Astrochemistry Laboratory at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, having joined NASA as a civil servant in 2009. She served as the Associate Chief of the Planetary Systems Laboratory from 2011 to 2016. Anderson's scientific research focuses on the remote sensing of planetary atmospheres, primarily in the areas of thermal structure and composition, using space- and ground-based data. Her earliest scientific work focused on the exosphere of Mercury (planet). She now performs radiative transfer analyses of the outer planets, including the effects of aerosols and condensates, as well as data analysis techniques in the visible, near-IR, mid- IR, far-IR, and submillimeter spectral regions. Dr. Anderson's research also includes transmission spectroscopy measurements of thin ice films using her SPECtroscopy of Titan-Related ice AnaLogs (SPECTRAL) high-vacuum chamber located in her Spectroscopy for Planetary ICes Environments (SPICE) laboratory. Dr. Anderson's more recent research concerns the atmosphere of Saturn's moon Titan, which is, according to NASA, \\"a model for what the early Earth might have been like.\\" Titan has a thick, nitrogen-dominated atmosphere and is the only world in the solar system other than Earth known to possess stable liquid on its surface.\\" (Titan's seas are not water, however, but methane and ethane.) In 2015, Anderson reported her discovery of a chemically new, high-altitude ice cloud residing in Titan's south polar stratosphere during Titan's early southern winter season, chemically consistent with co- condensed hydrogen cyanide and benzene. During her 12-year tenure on the Cassini Composite InfraRed Spectrometer (CIRS) team, Dr. Anderson also discovered additional ice clouds in Titan's stratosphere, including a co- condensed ice mixture containing hydrogen cyanide and cyanoacetylene, methane ice clouds formed via subsidence in Titan's lower stratosphere, the solid- state photochemical formation of dicyanoacetylene ice – co-condensed with hydrogen cyanide ice, in Titan's early northern spring stratosphere, as well as the discovery that Titan's photochemical aerosol is chemically uniform throughout the atmosphere at altitudes below the stratopause. Dr. Anderson has been heavily engaged in operations of the Cassini-Huygens mission in the Saturn system. Dr. Anderson is currently the Deputy Principal Investigator (DPI) on a submillimeter heterodyne spectrometer, aimed at a mission proposal concept to Enceladus. She is also DPI of a joint GSFC/JPL SmallSat mission concept to Venus, with a submillimeter heterodyne spectrometer as the primary instrument. She is also actively engaged in mission design concepts for planetary flight mission opportunities as well as projects involving submillimeter heterodyne spectrometer designs for future planetary flight missions. Anderson is a member of the American Geophysical Union and the American Astronomical Society's Division for Planetary Sciences.  Honors and awards  *NASA Robert H.

It was directed by Tristán Bauer, and has a script of Omar Quiroga and Florencia Kirchner (the daughter of the former president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner). It was released on August 1, 2018. Contents The film begins with a contrast between panoramic images of the Patagonia and images of police repression. The case is placed in the context of the Mapuche conflict, describes the 19th century Conquest of the desert with historical revisionism and links modern governors to it. Santiago Maldonado is described as a man concerned with social issues, who made frequent journeys, and details the context of his journey to the Mapuche Pu Lof where the event took place. It makes an interview to Ariel Garzi, who made 22 seconds phone call to Madonado's cell phone on August 2, one day after his death. It also interviews Matías Santana, who claimed that he saw the gendarmerie getting Maldonado inside a truck. The documentary is narrated by the actor Darío Grandinetti, and features a new song of León Gieco. There is also an interview to Santiago's mother, Stella Maris Peloso, who does not make many public appearances. The documentary is biased against the administration of Mauricio Macri, blaming it for the death of Maldonado. It does not reference the refusal of the Mapuche settlement to allow judge Otranto to investigate the crime scene, where the corpse of Santiago Maldonado was eventually found. Filming Bauer told to the press that \\"the film was born when a group of people, many of them very young, set ourselves to cover the Santiago Maldonado case, who was him, see the landscapes, the places, put images to the story\\". It was made in the time when Maldonado was still a missing person, between his disappearance on August 1 and the recovery of his corpse in the nearby river on October 17. Reception The documentary was harshly criticized by minister Patricia Bullrich, minister of security at the time of the case. She said that the documentary is just an example of the Relato K, and that Kirchnerism tried to shoehorn it as a case of a forced disappearance, in order to draw comparisons between the government of Mauricio Macri and the National Reorganization Process. She pointed that some people interviewed in the documentary, such as Matias Santana, are tried for perjury. Diego Batlle, from the newspaper La Nación, pointed that the documentary included several unpublished images and filmings, but does not provide new noteworthy information to the case. He considers that the documentary will be as polarizing in the public opinion as the case itself.

During an academic career spanning over four decades he wrote about 10 books and over 200 research articles on subjects ranging from his central interest in Smriti literature to \\"the Vedas, Vyākaraṇas, Kāvya, anthology, archaeology, world- history, paleography, and the Nyāya and Vaiśeṣika systems of philosophy.\\" Biography Hazra was born in 1905 in the village of Dogachi in what was then the Dacca District in Bengal and is now in Bangladesh. After being a star-pupil during his schooling years, he obtained a B.A. and M.A. in Sanskrit from Dacca University in 1929 and 1931, respectively; standing first class first at both stages. He earned a PhD in 1936 under the guidance of S. K. De, while working as a lecturer in Sanskrit and Bengali at the Jagannath Intermediate College. His thesis, Studies in the Purāṇic Records on Hindu Rites and Custom was published as a book in 1940 by Dacca University. Hazra obtained a D. Litt in 1940 with his Studies in the Upapuranas, which was incompletely published as a series of books by Munshiram Manoharlal withe permission of the then Principal of the Calcutta Sanskrit College and is considered by some to be his magnum opus. From 1939 to 1951, Hazra worked at Dacca University, where he rose to be the head of the Department of Sanskrit. During this period he, along with fellow faculty-member, R. C. Majumdar, aided revolutionaries fighting for Indian independence from British rule by giving them shelter in the university's Dacca Hall, where Hazra was the provost. Earlier, Hazra had qualified for the Indian Police Service but was refused appointment due to his connection with the revolutionaries. Hazra migrated to India in 1951 and joined the Department of Post-Graduate Studies at Sanskrit College, Calcutta. There he served as the professor of Smriti and Puranas till his retirement in 1972. Hazra worked closely with the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Calcutta's Asiatic Society, Ganganath Jha Research Institute, Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture and the Sahitya Akademi, and collaborated with Sanskritists and historians S. K. De, R. C. Majumdar, P. V. Kane, U. N. Ghoshal, A. D. Pulaskar, V. Raghavan, Suniti Kumar Chatterji, among others. He was elected a fellow of The Asiatic Society in 1964 and later awarded its S. C.

It stars Édgar Ramírez, Anna Brewster, Michael Pitt, Patrick Bergin, and Sharlto Copley. It was panned by critics, who labeled it as one of the worst films of all time, and also noted the film's release as unfortunate for coinciding with the George Floyd protests, due to its violent content and depictions of police brutality, and as of July 2020 holds a rare 0% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.  Plot  In 2024, the U.S. government prepares to activate the American Peace Initiative (API) signal, a “synaptic blocker” that will prevent the population from breaking the law. In Detroit, Graham Bricke leads a crew of bank robbers including his brother Rory, who begins a prison sentence. The API signal is tested while Bricke’s crew robs a bank, and one of the thieves is killed. Bricke lies to the Dumois crime family that he lost the stolen money, which he saves to escape to Canada, but is notified that Rory has killed himself in prison. One week before the signal’s nationwide deployment, Bricke’s money is taken. He tortures a man named Sidell into confessing that Johnny Dee, a member of Bricke’s crew, betrayed him to the Dumois syndicate. Bricke leaves Sidell to die in a fiery explosion, kills Johnny, and buys a deadly neurotoxin at a bar, where he is seduced by Shelby Dupree. He meets her fiancé Kevin Cash, who explains that he and Rory were used to test the signal in prison, and Rory was killed by the guards. Shelby and Kevin reveal their plan to steal over $1 billion from the city’s “money factory” by disrupting an API signal tower and fleeing across the river to Canada. Bricke takes over the heist, deducing that Kevin is the heir to the Dumois family. Shelby and Bricke begin an affair, and he recruits his trusted getaway driver Ross. The government is buying back criminals' ill-gotten wealth, and Shelby, a gifted hacker, prints $5 million in counterfeit bills which Bricke arranges to trade in. Following Shelby, Bricke learns she is an informant for the FBI, who threaten her younger sister to ensure her cooperation. As the city’s police department prepares to become obsolete, Officer William Sawyer is forced to kill an assailant in self-defense. He joins the new law enforcement division, and receives an implant making him immune to the API signal. Kevin takes Bricke to meet Rossi Dumois, his father. Rossi shoots and wounds Kevin, who kills him with an axe, and Kevin and Bricke raid Rossi’s weapons, including three EFP cone warheads. Bricke confronts Shelby for working with the FBI, but is knocked out and beaten by Lonnie, Rossi’s lieutenant. Shelby is taken hostage by Lonnie as Sidell, alive but disfigured, tortures Bricke and leaves him to die in a fire. Bricke is rescued by Ross and pursues Lonnie, who injects Shelby with heroin and prepares to rape her, but Bricke kills him. On the day the signal will deploy, Ross infiltrates the money factory in a dump truck, and Shelby subdues a systems manager at an API facility. Bricke and Kevin deliver the counterfeit $5 million to the factory and shoot their way to the vault, which they breach with the warheads. Shelby hacks the API system and disrupts the signal, allowing Bricke, Kevin, and Ross to load the truck with money and escape. Sawyer detains Shelby, and the signal resumes, incapacitating Ross and Bricke. Unaffected, Kevin kills Ross, revealing that he and Rory were forced to fight in prison by the guards, who tortured them with the API signal; Kevin learned to overcome the signal, and killed Rory. He shoots Bricke, but is killed by Shelby’s FBI handlers, who tell Bricke that they will kill Shelby to close their case. Left to die, Bricke consumes his neurotoxin; instead of killing him, it ends the signal’s effect on him. He kills the FBI agents and escapes in the truck full of money. Struggling against the signal, Shelby fights off Sawyer, who strangles her but is impaled on a glass shard and dies. Shelby blows up the facility, ignoring the agents preparing to shoot her. She is rescued by Bricke, and they plow through the border checkpoint into Canada. Shelby tells Bricke she loves him before he dies from his wounds, and she flees with a bag of money. Some time later, Shelby spreads Rory’s ashes at a lake, and drives away with her sister to a new life in Canada.

The film would be produced by Jesse Berger through Radical Studios, Jason Michael Berman through Mandalay Pictures, and Barry Levine and Kevin Turen. In October 2018, Anna Brewster, Michael Pitt, and Sharlto Copley joined the cast of the film. Principal photography on the film began on November 6, 2018. Filming took place in Cape Town and Johannesburg. Release The Last Days of American Crime was released digitally by Netflix on June 5, 2020. It was the top-watched film on the service in its first weekend. Reception Variety wrote that critics panned the film as \\"a derivative work that has nothing to say\\" and that its timing of its release with the killing of George Floyd and the related protests was \\"a disaster\\". On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 0% based on 41 reviews, with an average rating of 2.02/10. The site's critics consensus reads: \\"This Crime is punishment.\\" Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 15 out of 100, based on 12 critics, indicating \\"overwhelming dislike\\". David Ehrlich of IndieWire gave the film a \\"D–\\" and said, \\"[it's] not just because Olivier Megaton's agonizingly dull Netflix feature is 149 minutes long (a crime unto itself). While there's never really a good moment to introduce a bad movie into the world, this hollow and artless dystopian heist dreck is also a victim of its own relevance.\\" Peter Debruge of Variety called the film \\"gory, excessive and frequently incoherent\\" and wrote: \\"In light of everything that's going on, The Last Days of American Crime seems woefully out of touch, inadvertently offensive (a brutal fight scene in which Copley chokes Shelby seems oblivious to the legacy of real-world police brutality) and like some sloppy relic of what once passed for entertainment.\\"  References   External links  * Category:2020 action thriller films Category:2020s crime action films Category:2020s crime thriller films Category:American action thriller films Category:American crime action films Category:American crime drama films Category:American crime thriller films Category:American films Category:Films based on American comics Category:Films based on American crime novels Category:Films directed by Olivier Megaton Category:Films set in 2024 Category:Films shot in South Africa Category:Live- action films based on comics Category:Mandalay Pictures films Category:2020 films Category:English-language Netflix original films ","title":"The Last Days of American Crime"},{"id":"58010115","text":"Reza Azari (, born 10 February 1998) is an Iranian football midfielder, who currently plays for Esteghlal in Persian Gulf Pro League.

The term is most commonly used with rifles manufactured or retrofitted to comply with gun laws in California. Guns with a bullet button, pistol grip, flash suppressor and folding stock have been considered assault weapons requiring formal registration in California since July 1, 2018. While some gun owners have opted to register their guns, others have chosen to make modifications to keep their weapons compliant with state regulations such that registration is not required. One common change for guns with a flash suppressor is to replace it with a muzzle brake, and some have converted their guns to use .22 Long Rifle cartridges, which are smaller and less expensive than the 5.56×45mm NATO / .223 Remington cartridges that AR-15 style rifles are predominantly chambered in. Some companies sell \\"featureless grips\\" made of Kydex that can convert pistol grips so they no longer meet the statutory definition of prohibited features. With these types of modifications, high-capacity magazines can still be used. Some companies, like Cobalt Kinetics and Hi-Point Firearms, have released rifles designed to be \\"featureless\\" under California's assault weapons statute.

In the 1800s, Nielsen traveled around Europe to learn about cheesemaking. Nielsen's farm was in Havarthigaard, north of Copenhagen, and in 1852, after returning from her travels, developed the technique to create Havarti, a semi-firm cheese dotted with small holes. Havarti was, however, not introduced in Denmark until around 1920. The original Havarti cheese is different from flødehavarti (\\"cream Havarti\\"), which is made from high- pasteurized milk, so that the whey proteins that would otherwise be eliminated during production remain in the curd. This raises yields, but alters the taste and texture. Cream Havarti usually ripens very little, since the remaining whey proteins cause problems (off-taste, odd appearance) during prolonged ripening.

It is located one mile east of Barlow Pass along the Mountain Loop Highway near the Monte Cristo area. It is situated on land administered by the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. Back in the old mining days of the late 1800s, the long sub-range stretching from Cadet Peak to Sheep Mountain was known as Pride of the Mountains Range. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into tributaries of the Sauk River. Climate Sheep Mountain is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below or above . During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The “U”-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

Biography He was the son of a pharmacist in Helsingør, Johannes Holten (1741-1816) and his wife Anna Margrethe, born Abildgaard (1747-1826). He was born in Helsingør on 11 July 1770, and was named Johan after his father, but preferred to be known as Hans. During his upbringing and in his youth, he lived in the house of the Pentecostal priest P.D. Bast who was married to his aunt. In 1788, he became a student of the Nykøbing School, where he studied zoology. Later, he became the curator of scientific collections made by Prince Christian Frederik, who was later to become Christian VIII of Denmark. In 1801 he took up the post of science tutor for Prince Christian's younger brother, Prince Ferdinand, and at this time he lived at the royal residence of Sorgenfri Palace. In 1804 he accompanied the young prince on a journey to Germany and he was also the prince's librarian. In 1799 while at Helsingør, he caught a rare fish, a John Dory (Zeus faber), and noticed some parasites on the gills which he called \\"gillworms\\". He went on to provide the first description of these, calling them Chondracanthus merluccii, and later provided the first description of another gillworm from a flying fish, which he called Lernaea exocoeti, and which is now known as Pennella exocoeti. Holten's only literary work is the Fauna or Animal History of Denmark and Norway, of which only 1 booklet (mammal) was published (1800), and a systematic auction catalog of Johann Hieronymus Chemnitz's collection of cones (1802). On 19 February 1796, he married Fredensborg Juliane Marie Wittendorff (27 October 1770 – 13 March 1838), daughter of the royal cantor P.A. Wittendorff. Holten died in Copenhagen on 30 December 1805.

During his long career as a writer, he published sixteen novels, poetry, and several biographies of artists and authors including Vincent van Gogh, D. H. Lawrence, Anton Chekhov, Walt Whitman, and Paul Cézanne. Life Callow was born into a working-class family in Stechford, near Birmingham. In 1930, his family moved to Coventry, where he spent the remainder of his childhood. He attended Coventry Technical College, and at the age of fifteen was apprenticed as a toolmaker at the Coventry Gauge and Tool Company. In 1948, he became a clerk at the ministries of war and supplies, where he worked for three years. He later moved to Plymouth and became a clerk at the South West Electricity Board. His first novel, The Hosanna Man, was published in 1956, but was later pulled by the publisher over the threat of a libel lawsuit. According to a present-day commentator, \\"The flair he would display as both a novelist and biographer is very much in evidence.\\"Sixty Items from the Twentieth Century, London: Jarndyce Books, [2020]. Though he continued writing novels, he also returned to school in the 1960s, attending Exmouth College of Education, where he trained to become a teacher. In the 1970s and '80s, he taught creative writing at various universities. During this time, he also turned to writing biographies, starting with Son and Lover, a biography of D. H. Lawrence published in 1975. From 1980 to 1986, he was appointed writer-in-residence at Sheffield Polytechnic. Callow was married to Irene Christian Vallance (1952–1973), Penelope Jane Newman (1974–1987), and Anne Jennifer Golby (1987–2007). He had one daughter from his first marriage, Fleur Alyse Harvey. Work =Early novels= Callow's first novel, The Hosanna Man (1956), is a portrayal of a Midlands artist inspired by Callow's own life. The main character, Louis, moves from Coventry to Nottingham to pursue both a career as an artist and an affair with a married woman, Stella. Louis meets a cast of bohemians and other artists as he attempts to develop his skills in painting watercolors and writing poetry. Though the novel was met with some positive reviews, it was withdrawn by the publisher after a Nottingham bookseller claimed to recognize himself in one of the characters. The bookseller threatened to sue for libel, and the publisher, fearing a lawsuit, pulped the remaining copies. In his second novel, Common People (1958), Callow continued his autobiographical exploration of the life of Midlands artists. The novel's protagonist, Nick Chapman, is torn between his dream of pursuing a career as an artist in London and his desire to settle down and \\"know common joys\\" in his home town of Woodfield.Ben Clarke, \\"Introduction.\\" Philip Callow. ed., Common People, 1958; Valancourt Books, 2017. Common People was chosen as one of the Sunday Times best books of the year by John Betjeman, who said that Callow's writing \\"sounds like a genuine cry from a class usually silent in the literary world.\\" In subsequent novels, including Native Ground (1959), A Pledge for the Earth (1960), and Clipped Wings (1963), Callow experimented with non-autobiographical subject matter and third-person narration. =Another Flesh trilogy= Callow's \\"best-received and appreciated fictional work\\" was the trilogy Going to the Moon (1968), The Bliss Body (1969), and Flesh of the Morning (1971), later released in an omnibus volume as Another Flesh. Like much of his work, the trilogy is set in the midlands and has autobiographical elements. In his review of The Bliss Body, Robert Baldick praised Callow as \\"the master of the literary cliffhanger.\\" =Biographies= At the suggestion of his agent, Callow began writing biographies of authors and artists he admired. He began with Son and Lover (1975), a biography of fellow working-class author D. H. Lawrence, to whom Callow has often been compared. He continued writing biographies until the end of his life, including accounts of Vincent van Gogh, Anton Chekhov, Walt Whitman, Paul Cézanne, and others. His biographies have been both praised and criticized for their \\"exuberant style\\" and \\"conscious rejection of objectivity.\\" =Late works= Writing autobiographies reinvigorated Callow both creatively and financially, and he returned to fiction with The Painter's Confession (1989), Some Love (1991), and The Magnolia (1994). His last published non-fiction work was Passage From Home, an autobiographical text published in 2002. Callow also wrote poetry sporadically throughout his life, publishing over a dozen such volumes. Reception Callow's work was consistently met with praise from critics. Penelope Mortimer of the Sunday Times called Common People \\"The most brilliantly successful account of English working-class life I have ever encountered in any medium,\\" while Isabel Quigly praised the novel as \\"alive\\", calling it \\"the direct stuff of life, so direct it scarcely has the form of fiction, so present it is painful, so truthful it is cleansing, salutary and exhilarating.\\" V. S. Naipaul called Callow's prose \\"clear and easy and elegant\\" and his observations of people and settings \\"sharp but kind and never superficial.\\" Margaret Drabble also praised Callow's fairness and accuracy: \\"By some happy balance of insight and sympathy, Philip Callow manages to engage attention and understanding without alienating common sense.\\" J. B. Priestley praised his \\"admirable and indeed all-too-rare truth, sincerity and sensitiveness\\" and said that his prose was \\"[d]one beautifully, with fine economy.\\" Some scholars include Callow as a member of the Angry Young Men, a loosely-affiliated group of post-war working-class authors.

Bounded in the north by Myron Street, the south by Morris Causeway and Lighthouse Road, and on the east by the East Haven town line, the area was developed as a coastal summer community before being transformed into a streetcar suburb in the second quarter of the 20th century. It contains a high concentration of quality residential architecture from the first half of the century, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Description and history Morris Cove was a rural agricultural area of East Haven until after the American Civil War, at which time local landowners began to open their homes and build small hotels to serve tourists. One of the oldest such surviving houses now stands at 265 Townsend Avenue; built in the 1870s, it was then known as the Pioneer Guest House. In 1881, Morris Cove and adjacent areas were transferred from East Haven to New Haven, but retained a measure of civic autonomy. By the early 1900s there were still relatively few year-round residents, but there was a school and a fire station, and the community maintained its own police force. The transition to a year-round community began in the early 1900s, when a trolley line was run down Townsend Avenue. The area was developed more fully as a residential area, with a small commercial hub near the southern end of the cove. The historic district consists of a densely built grid of street oriented toward the cove, which forms its western boundary. Between Townsend Avenue and the cove in the northern half of the district lies Pardee Seawall Park, a city park that extends northward to Fort Nathan Hale. Most of the houses in the district are of wood frame construction, and are in styles popular in the early 20th century: Colonial Revival, Craftsman, Bungalow, and Dutch Colonial. Interspersed are a number of examples of the older Italianate, Queen Anne, and Shingle styles from the last three decades of the 19th century. There are 341 historically significant buildings in the district.

Coleman (born May 15, 1950 in Chicago, IL) is an electrical engineer who worked at Bell Labs, Rockwell International, and the University of Illinois, Urbana. He is best known for his work on semiconductor lasers, materials and devices including strained-layer indium gallium arsenide lasers and selective area epitaxy. Coleman is a Fellow of the IEEE and a member of the US National Academy of Engineering.  Career  James J. Coleman was born in the Garfield Ridge neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois and went to St. Daniel the Prophet elementary school and St. Laurence high school. He was the eldest son of Harry A. Coleman and Lorita M. Kelly. He studied electrical engineering at the University of Illinois, Urbana graduating with a BSEE in 1972. He stayed on at Illinois and was granted an MSEE in 1973 under the direction of O.L. Gaddy. Continuing at Illinois he did his PhD research under the direction of Nick Holonyak, writing a thesis on room temperature visible semiconductor diode lasers. He received his PhD from Illinois in 1975. Coleman joined Bell Labs, Murray Hill in 1976, where his initial assignment was in the Materials Science Research Department under the direction of Morton B. Panish. His work there involved contributions to the development of 1.3 μm InGaAsP CW room temperature diode telecommunications lasers grown by liquid phase epitaxy (LPE). In 1978, he went to Rockwell International, Anaheim to work with P. Daniel Dapkus on metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), which has become a major process in the manufacture of compound semiconductor devices. They made use of this process to study MOCVD-grown heteroface AlGaAs solar cells, low-threshold single mode AlGaAs-GaAs double heterostructure lasers and quantum well heterostructure laser devices. In 1982, he returned to the University of Illinois, Urbana where he was professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering and held the Intel Alumni Endowed Chair. He and his students were the first group to define experimentally the ranges of wavelength, threshold current density, and reliability of 980 nm strained- layer InGaAs lasers. They reported high performance narrow linewidth DBR lasers, integrated lasers and other photonic devices by selective-area epitaxy, and detailed the growth processes for patterned quantum dot lasers. Coleman directed more that twenty-nine PhD thesis students at Illinois, most of who took their first jobs in industry. He was named to the List of Teachers Ranked as Excellent twelve times. He is presently the Intel Alumni Endowed Chair Emeritus in Electrical and Computer Engineering. In 2013, he joined the University of Texas at Dallas as the Erik Jonsson School Distinguished Chair in Electrical Engineering. Coleman has had significant involvement in the publications, conference, and leadership activities of the major professional societies associated with the field of photonics (IEEE, OSA, SPIE, APS, and AAAS). He has served the IEEE Photonics Society (formerly the IEEE Lasers and Electro-Optics Society) as an Associate Editor of IEEE Photonics Technology Letters (9 years), a Distinguished Lecturer, an elected member of the Board of Governors, and as Vice-President for Publications. He completed a five-year commitment to the leadership of the society having served as President-Elect, President and Past-President. The society awarded him the Distinguished Service Award in 2008.

NDUFAF7 is a methyltransferase mitochondrial assembly enzyme involved in the assembly and stabilization of NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) also known as complex I, which is located in the mitochondrial inner membrane and is the largest of the five complexes of the electron transport chain. Mutations in NDUFAF7 have been associated with pathologic myopia and complex I deficiency.  Structure  NDUFAF7 is located on the p arm of chromosome 2 in position 22.2 and has 14 exons. The NDUFAF7 gene produces a 49.2 kDa protein composed of 441 amino acids. NDUFAF7 is believed to be a part of the S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase family. This family has a characteristic seven-β-strand protein fold. NDUFAF7 is a type II arginine methyltransferase, meaning that its enzymatic activity produces a symmetrical ω-NG,NG′-dimethylarginine. It has a methyltransferase domain and an N-terminal sequence that corresponds to the recognized mitochondrial-targeting peptide. NDUFAF7's stoichometry is disputed with some findings indicating that it is a homodimer, while others denote it to be monomeric.  Function  The NDUFAF7 gene encodes an assembly factor protein that is localized in the mitochondria and which helps in the assembly and stabilization of complex I, a large multi- subunit enzyme in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) is involved in several physiological activities in the cell, including metabolite transport and ATP synthesis. Complex I catalyzes the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone (coenzyme Q) in the first step of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, resulting in the translocation of protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The encoded protein of NDUFAF7 is a methyltransferase that symmetrically dimethylates the ω-NG,NG′ atoms of Arg85 of subunit NDUFS2 of complex I in the early stages of its assembly. This interaction between NDUFAF7 and NDUFS2 is believed to be transient and it is suggested that this methylation stabilizes a 400 kDa subcomplex primarily associated with the peripheral arm of complex I. Without this methylation, the amount of intact complex I is significantly reduced, illustrating NDUFAF7's importance to the mitochondrial respiratory chain. A pseudogene related to this gene is located on chromosome 8. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.  Clinical significance  Defects in NDUFAF7 may be a cause of susceptibility to pathologic myopia, a genetically heterogeneous disorder characterized by extreme, familial, early- onset vision loss and described as myopia accompanied by severe deformation of the eye besides excessive elongation of the eye. This defect, a heterozygous D266E missense mutation, also resulted in reduced complex I activity. Due to is role in early assembly of complex I, it has been suggested that mutations affecting NDUFAF7 may be lethal.  Interactions  NDUFAF7 interacts transiently with NDUFS2, dimethylating Arg85 on the subunit. A correlation between the presence of MidA and NDUFS7 was also identified. In addition to co-complexes, NDUFAF4 has protein-protein interactions with LRRK2, q5nfq6_fratt, and q5ngw2_fratt.

History The English Courteen Association attempted to sponsor a colony at St. Augustine on the south-western Madagascar coast. Colonists landed in 1645 but by the following year disease, famine, and conflict with the native Malagasy reduced their numbers too far and the colonists fled; within a few decades the bay surrounding St. Augustine was a favorite stopping point for pirates. Ex-pirate Rivers set up a small settlement and trading post at St. Augustine in 1686. He charged trading fees to merchants and slavers who came to exchange goods. Fellow pirate John Halsey visited St. Augustine Bay in 1705, as did John Bowen and Thomas White. Castaway sailor Robert Drury survived the loss of the Degrave in 1703 and spent many years in service to various native Kings, as well as visiting John Pro and other ex-pirate traders. In his memoir he recalled how Samuel Burgess traveled to St. Augustine to buy slaves. Drury often searched for a way to escape the island, looking for a place where American or European ships might stop so he could beg for passage. He was not enthusiastic about his chances of finding passage off Madagascar from St. Augustine: “And when I came to consider that ships come to this country, and the poor condition of St. Augustine Bay rendered it very unlikely they should come to trade there, I did not find; but I was by this providence likely to get sooner to England than any other place where I had yet been.” Rivers died in 1719, the same year as fellow pirate traders Pro and Thomas Collins.

It had some advanced features but its unconventional control system may have caused the landing accident at the end of its first and only flight. Design and development Reports of the first German glider contest, held at the Wasserkuppe in the late summer of 1920, generated considerable interest in Poland, leading to the First Polish Glider Contest at Czarna Góra between 30 August and 13 September 1923. The contest was not a great success, limited by novice designers and pilots and a poor site, but the Karpiński SL.1 Akar was by far the most successful entrant. Another entrant to the Contest, the M.1 was an all-wood monoplane which incorporated several unusual features. It was aerodynamically clean, with a parasol wing and one of only two contestants with a twin-skid undercarriage rather than wheels, decreasing both drag and weight. The wing was in two parts, each half-wing a single spar structure with plywood covering ahead of the spar and fabric covering behind. Their two inner ends were mounted independently to a ply centre-section box by their spars in such a way that the latter could be independently rotated, altering the angles of incidence. The rotation was controlled by push-rods to the wings' inner ends, differential rotation replacing conventional ailerons and rotation together replacing elevators. The centre-section was supported over the fuselage on pairs of short, vertical struts at its front and rear and the wings were braced with short inverted-V struts from the upper fuselage to their spars. The fuselage was rectangular in section and ply-covered. It was deepest under the wing to accommodate the open cockpit and tapered strongly both forward and aft, with a profile like that of a thick airfoil. The M.1's empennage was a fabric-covered cantilever structure with a conventional fin and rudder but a one-piece, flight- adjustable tailplane. The M.1 made its first and last flight on 29 August 1923, just before the Contest began. It flew for 17 s but crashed heavily on landing, injuring its pilot Franciszek Wieden. The unfamiliar control system has been blamed for the accident; the M.1 was not repaired.

The process followed the loosened power grip of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union as a result of demokratizatsiya policy of the perestroika period of Mikhail Gorbachev.

It was recorded with two guitars (the second played by his brother Ramón de Algeciras), with a bass and a bongo, instead of the traditional palmas played on the rumbas. At first the album did not have much commercial success, being practically discontinued in a few months. But Jesus Quintero, his representative at that time, and several other journalists were determined that this piece of music be heard on the radio. They convinced the record company to edit it as a single, going on sale in 1974. As a single, Entre dos aguas sold more than 300,000 copies, being a gold single in 1976, and was 22 weeks at the top of the sales charts, catapulting the guitarist's career. After the success of the song as a single, the label reedited the album Fuente y caudal in 1975, it was released in cassette format in 1981 and in CD format in 1987. Likewise, the song was included in several compilations. Since its inception, Entre dos aguas is considered a masterpiece of flamenco, being the most popular and well-known song of the artist, both nationally and internationally. However, it was not a song worked with time, but an improvisation that Paco was asked by producer José Torregrosa to perform at the time of recording, since he considered the album to be incomplete. Apparently, Paco used other references to improvise the song, such as the song Te estoy amando locamente, by Las Grecas, and the song he co-written Caramba, carambita, by Los Marismeños, where in the latter can be seen more clearly the similarity.

An 1888 biography has been shown to be largely fictitious, and little is known of his life. Life A life of Huet de Navarre is given in Appletons' Cyclopædia of American Biography, Volume 3 (1888). It relates how Huet de Navarre was born in Conde sur Noireau in 1611, was lieutenant to a French expedition under Poncet de Bretigny that established a colony on the banks of the Cayenne River in 1643, was elected governor of the colony in 1644 after Bretigny had been murdered, was reelected head of the colony after a new French expedition arrived in 1652, and died in Suriname in 1656 after the French had been driven from Cayenne. Unfortunately, it has been shown that although there was a M. de Navarre in Cayenne in 1652, most of the Appleton's biography must be considered fictitious. It is known that in 1643 Charles Poncet de Brétigny of the Compagnie de Rouen(fr), arrived with 400 settlers. He bought the hill at the mouth of the Cayenne River from the local Kalina people (Caribs) and named it \\"Morne Cépérou\\" after the Kalina chief who sold it. The first wooden Fort Cépérou was built on the hill, and a village was built below it. Bretigny was ruthless and despotic, and terrorized both the colonists and the indigenous people. In 1644 a Kalina killed Bretigny with an axe to the head. In September 1652 the twelve seigneurs of the Compagnie de la France équinoxiale landed 800 men at the tip of the Pointe du Mahury, where they found 25 survivors from the previous expedition. According to Jean Laon the 1652 expedition found a Monsieur de Navarre in command of Fort Cépérou. He had arrived there from France about six months earlier, and was a first sergeant. He was promoted to lieutenant for surrendering the fort to the new arrivals. All of the new settlers were soon killed by the Caribs or had escaped to Barbados. There is therefore an element of truth, but most of the Appleton's account from before or after 1652 is either unlikely or impossible.

He is most noted for his heroic role in the rescue of 32 crew members from Italian freighter Florida and for commanding the SS United States on her record-breaking maiden crossings of the Atlantic. He was among those honored in two ticker tape parades: the first in 1929 as a crew member of the America and again in 1952 as master of the SS United States. As an aviator, Manning served as a navigator for Amelia Earhart. Early life Harry Manning was born as Harry Luelker in Hamburg, Germany on February 3, 1897. When his mother Anna married William Edwards Manning, a British diplomat, his name was changed to that of his stepfather. (His legal middle initial, \\"V\\", was rarely used and appeared in only one publication.) His parents moved to New York City when he has about ten years old but his stepfather died soon after. His short stature, only , and a slight physical build subjected him to what would now be called bullying. He responded to the taunts by engaging in fistfights, and even took boxing lessons. He enrolled in the New York State Nautical School which at that time was based on the training ship Newport and taught grammar school subjects in addition to seamanship, graduating in 1914. His first job at sea was on the liner St. Paul, where he became the quartermaster on the second voyage. He would however be fired after a voyage to Nantucket when he suffered seasickness in choppy seas and failed to execute a maneuver. He next went to the Pacific where he used his experience with sail (the training ship Newport was a sail/steam hybrid) on board the bark Dirigio. He next served on Army transports and on freighters of the Isthmian Steamship Company. United States Lines He joined the United States Lines in 1922 and advanced up the officer ranks on the liners George Washington and Leviathan. He received his first command in 1927 as master of the President Roosevelt. Manning came to national attention in 1929 when the report of his role in the rescue of the crew from the Italian freighter Florida appeared on the front page of The New York Times. That January Manning was serving on the America as her Chief Officer. Then commanded by Captain George Fried, America was steaming from France to New York. As she battled her way through a major storm, the liner picked up distress signals from Florida. Guided by her radio direction finder, the American ship homed in on the endangered ship and finally sighted the listing vessel through light snow squalls. Taking a position off Florida's weather beam, America lowered her number one lifeboat, commanded by Manning, with a crew of eight men. After the boat had been rowed to within of Florida, Manning had a line thrown across to the crew of the distressed freighter. One by one, the 32 men from the Italian ship came across the rope. By the time the last of them, the ship's captain, had been dragged on board the pitching lifeboat, the winds had reached gale force, with violent snow and rain squalls, with a high, rough, sea running. Then, via ladders, ropes, cargo nets, and two homemade breeches buoys, sailors on board America brought up Florida's survivors, until all 32 were safely aboard. Finally, they pulled their shipmates from the rescue party back on board. Chief Officer Manning was brought up last. On January 28 Captain Fried and the crew of the America were honored in a ticker tape parade. Manning even appeared in a cigarette advertisement. At that time celebrity endorsements were common in tobacco advertising but Manning reputedly was a non-smoker. His interest in navigation and air transport led him to become a pilot in 1930. Manning first met Amelia Earhart in 1928. She was returning from her transatlantic crossing as a passenger on the President Harding and Manning was the master. Close in age and with a mutual interest in aviation, the two became friends en route. In January 1937 the United States Lines granted him a leave of absence to serve as a navigator for Amelia Earhart's attempt to circumnavigate the globe. Manning made extensive preparations for the flight which began on March 17, 1937 from Oakland, California. Earhart's plane was damaged in Honolulu and required extensive repairs. There are conflicting accounts on why Manning left her crew at this point. In one account, Manning was unable to extend his leave of absence and had to return to the United States Lines. Another version claims that he was concerned about her \\"aggressive\\" handling of the plane. Earhart would continue on but later disappeared near Howland Island. The following year Manning sustained critical injuries when his own plane crashed near Roosevelt Field, L.I. He suffered fractures to both legs, his skull and chest injuries. After his recovery he decided to cease flying. WWII service In July 1940 the United States had not yet entered WWII and was considered a neutral country. Manning was on the bridge of the liner Washington, off the coast of Europe, when a German U-boat surfaced and immediately signaled for him to abandon ship, which would then be torpedoed. Manning's replies identified his ship as flying the neutral United States flag. While the messages were relayed Manning ordered his passengers and crew to lifeboat stations. The U‐boat commander eventually told him to proceed, adding “thought you were another vessel.” Manning was made captain of the America (which replaced the 1905 vessel by that name) but his tenure was cut short when the United States Lines ended all commercial service and its ships were refitted for war time transport. When the United States officially entered WWII in 1941 Manning went on active duty in the Navy. As a Navy Reserve Lieutenant Commander he served on the Washington, now the troop ship Mount Vernon. In 1942 he was promoted to Commander and captain of the training ship American Navigator. Later in the war he was superintendent of the US Maritime Service training stations at Huntington, and Hoffman Island, and Avalon. Postwar and the Blue Riband At the end of the war Manning returned to the United States Lines. He was named Commodore and resumed his duties as master of the America after that vessel's return to commercial passenger service. In March 1952 the new flagship United States was nearing completion and the United States Lines made the formal announcement of Manning as her master. Manning was already preparing for her first crossing in 1951 when he met with representatives from the ship's designers and the US Lines in his captain's quarters on the America. They were already considering breaking the transatlantic speed record for the Blue Riband and discussed how far the ship should be pushed on her first voyage. The maiden crossing began at Noon on July 3, 1952. The publicity over the new ship and the secrecy over her speed fed speculation that the ship would try for the eastbound speed record. When asked by reporters on board Manning coyly replied, \\"If the ship makes a record, I can't help that.\\" The first day out the ship was averaging 34 knots. The weather deteriorated July 4–5 with heavy fog and choppy seas, but the ship averaged 35 knots. When the ship passed Bishop's Rock, the traditional Blue Riband finish point, on the morning of July 7 her exact crossing time was 3 days, 10 hours, and 40 minutes. Manning's followed his plan to use a bit more power each day: 34.11 knots, 35.60, 36.17 and then 36.21. The return trip would be made in 3 days, 12 hours, and 12 minutes. Manning had to slow the ship through fog and heavy traffic patterns yet still averaged 34.51 knots. On July 18 he participated in the second ticker tape parade of this career when he and his crew were honored for setting the new speed record crossing the Atlantic. Manning's time as master of the United States was to be short lived as he was removed after the second round trip. Officially he said that he was tired from the little sleep he had on the maiden crossings. However, tensions had long been brewing among the unions, the ship's designer, and the United States Lines management. He was a vocal critic of maritime labor unions and refused to join the Masters, Mates, & Pilots organization. He clashed with designer William Francis Gibbs regarding the operation of the ship. Improvements in ship to shore communications had allowed shore side management to monitor the day-to-day operation of the ship. Management was furious over Manning appearing to be racing against Cunard's Queen Elizabeth. Manning would make only a few relief trips after that. He was brought back for the official presentation of the Blue Riband Hales Trophy on November 12, 1952. He made his last trip in March 1953. He was retained as a consultant to the US Lines and retired as commodore for the United States Lines and as a Vice Admiral in the US Navy Reserve. Personal life On January 30, 1940 Manning married Florence Isabella Trowbridge Heaton (1916-2008). Also a pilot, she had met him in 1934 and shared his interest in aviation. Their union produced a daughter, Florence, but they divorced in 1942. After his retirement from the United States Lines he married Mildred Bachmann Eisenhardt (1902-1988); they remained married until his death. While Manning's formal education was limited, he was self-taught on several subjects and could quote lines from Shakespeare's Troilus and Cressida. He was regarded as an excellent dancer and the ship stewards sent him the best dance partners. He was however uncomfortable in making small talk but did learn the social graces needed to host the captain's table. His passenger receptions tended to be small, formal, and brief and if it dragged on he would say that he had to go to the bridge to cut it short. During his convalescence from his 1938 accident he had learned to play the piano, and even had a grand piano in his quarters on the America. Manning had a reputation for being hot-tempered and very self-assured. In recalling an altercation with the master of the Leviathan he admitted, \\"I was an awful son of a bitch in those days.\\" Of his own skills he once remarked, \\"Navigation in bad weather was my specialty.\\" One passenger remarked, \\"You don’t always get a glad hand when you sail with Manning, but you feel dammed safe.\\" He retired to a quiet and private life of lecturing and consultant work. He died at his home in Saddle River, NJ on August 1, 1974. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery with the rank \\"Captain, US Navy\\", his rank at the end of WWII.

Spalding, a prominent clergyman in the Troy conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church. Her parents possessed literary talents. Her father was a graduate of Union College, and a brilliant orator. Her mother, Harriet Dorr, was a graduate of Mrs. Willard's Troy Seminary, and an artist of merit. Harriet had there siblings: Dorr Spalding, Dr. Warren Clyde Spalding, and Nathaniel Bull Spalding. Harriet inherited the talents of both parents. In 1868, the family removed to Schodack Landing, New York. Harriet was carefully and liberally educated. In 1877, she was graduated in the Albany Female Academy, where she won six gold medals offered by the alumni in various branches of composition. Career She began to write verses at the age of nine years. She wrote much and her work was widely copied. Spalding was the author of a volume of poems. She died August 14, 1935, in Schenectady, New York, and was buried at Albany Rural Cemetery, Menands, New York. Style and themes Her sonnets have been characterized by a critic as among the finest in the English language. A singular charm pervades all her verse. Its art was always sure, her methods of composition being invariably conscientious and painstaking, while its spirit –whether dealing with pathos or passion– is of rare grace and beauty.

It is located 10 miles south of Darrington, Washington and west of Glacier Peak which is one of the Cascade stratovolcanoes. It is situated on land administered by the Mount Baker- Snoqualmie National Forest. The nearest higher peak is Devils Peak, to the southwest. Precipitation runoff from Devils Thumb drains into tributaries of the Sauk River. Climate Devils Thumb is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below or above . During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

Ride. Rodeo. is a 2019 American biopic directed by Conor Allyn from a screenplay by Sean Dwyer and Greg Cope White about the life of Amberley Snyder, a nationally ranked rodeo barrel racer who defies the odds to return to the sport after barely surviving a car crash that leaves her paralyzed from the waist down. It stars Missi Pyle, Spencer Locke, Bailey Chase, and Sherri Shepherd. Plot 19-year-old Amberley Snyder (Spencer Locke) is a nationally-ranked rodeo barrel racer who spends most of her time training with her horse Power at her home in Utah. On her way to Denver, Amberley loses control over her truck and crashes; she is thrown from the vehicle and hits a fence pole, leaving her paralyzed from the waist down. Amberley is rushed to hospital where doctors confirm she will spend the rest of her life in a wheelchair. She is later taken to Utah to begin a six-week rehabilitation programme. Amberley is initially despondent and lashes out at her mother Tina (Missi Pyle), knowing she will never be able to do all the things she used to do, but over time she pushes herself to find balance and strength in her upper body. She returns home to an e-mail from Tate Watkins with the FFA, who asks if she'll still be participating in the event. They communicate via video call over a number of weeks and grow closer. Amberley struggles to adjust to daily life but later, with determination and passion, learns to drive and realises she can still ride a horse if she attaches a seat belt to her saddle. She also starts college at Utah South. Over the upcoming months, Amberley becomes more and more confident on her horse and takes part in the Spanish Fork Rodeo where she comes second place, less than twelve months since her accident. She continues training in preparation for The American Rodeo, but fails to tell her family about an infected pressure sore on her back. One afternoon Amberley collapses and is rushed to hospital to be told she is critical. Six weeks later, Amberley has recovered and begins training again, fuelled by positive fan mail and letters from people in similar situations. At The American, Amberley and Tate share a romantic kiss. Tina expresses how proud she is of Amberley for how far she has come in the last eighteen months, saying \\"You may have lost the use of your legs but it's opened up your heart\\". Tina tells Amberley to ride like the wind as she makes her way out. Amberley is a professional barrel rider to this day, and also tours the country as a motivational speaker.

It was designed by the NSW Colonial Architect's Office and built from 1890 to 1892 by Messrs Banks and Whitehouse. Prior to 1968, it was also known as Wollongong Post and Telegraph Office or Wollongong Post Office. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 24 January 2003.  History  =Background= The first official postal service in Australia was established in April 1809, when the Sydney merchant Isaac Nichols was appointed as the first Postmaster in the colony of NSW. Prior to this, mail delivery was neither secure nor reliable as it was distributed directly by the captain of the ship on which the mail arrived. In 1825 the colonial administration was empowered to establish a Postmaster General's Department, which had previously been administered from Britain. In 1828, the first post offices outside Sydney were established, which included offices in Bathurst, Campbelltown, Parramatta, Liverpool, Newcastle, Penrith and Windsor. By 1839, there were forty post offices in the colony; more post offices opened as settlement spread. During the 1860s, the advance of postal services was further increased as the railway network was established throughout NSW. In 1863, the Postmaster General, W. H. Christie, noted that accommodation facilities for postmasters in some post offices were quite limited, and stated that it was a matter of importance that \\"post masters should reside and sleep under the same roof as the office\\". Electric communication came to NSW in 1858 when the first telegraph lines were opened in Sydney; lines connecting the Sydney GPO to the South Head Signal Station and to Liverpool. Further development in NSW was slow compared to other states, with the Government actively concentrating on the development of country offices before suburban offices. In 1862, James Barnet was appointed Acting Colonial Architect. His appointment coincided with a considerable increase in funding to public works programs, many of which included the construction of new post and telegraph offices. Indeed, between 1865 and 1890, the Colonial Architect's Office was responsible for the construction and maintenance of 169 post and telegraph offices throughout NSW. In 1870 the postal and telegraph departments were amalgamated, after which time new post and telegraph offices were constructed to include both services. The first significant telephone experiments in Australia were conducted in Sydney in January 1878, with three tests being carried out between La Perouse and Sydney. The Sydney Morning Herald of 14 January 1878 wrote: 'Our readers are probably aware that a discovery has been made in the art of telegraphy which when fully developed may lead to an entirely new and simple system of communication.' It wasn't until 1 November 1880, however, that what is claimed to be the first telephone service in NSW was established between the Exchange and the Government woolsheds at Darling Harbour. On 11 October 1881, the first telephone exchange was opened in Sydney and, following the establishment of the switchboard, the Electric Telegraph Department took over the telephone system and relocated it to the GPO. From this point onwards, the growth of telephone lines expanded rapidly and, by March 1883, the exchange had become important enough to warrant a twenty-four hour service. As with the telegraph, the telephone system soon began to extend into the country areas, with telephone exchanges appearing in NSW country towns from the late-1880s onwards. Again, the post office was responsible for the public telephone exchange, which further emphasised its place in the community as the provider of communications services. The construction of new post offices continued throughout the 1890s Depression years of the late-nineteenth century under the leadership of Walter Liberty Vernon, who held office from 1890 to 1911. However, while twenty-seven post offices were built between 1892 and 1895, funding to the Government Architect's Office was cut from 1893 to 1895, which caused Vernon to postpone a number of projects. Following Federation in 1901, the Commonwealth Government took over responsibility for post, telegraph and telephone offices. The Department of Home Affairs Works Division was made responsible for post office construction. In 1916, construction of post offices and telephone exchanges was transferred to the Department of Works and Railways, after which the Department of the Interior became responsible during World War II. On 22 December 1975, the Postmaster General's Department was abolished and replaced by the Post and Telecommunications Department, resulting in the creation of Telecom Australia (later Telstra) and Australia Post. In 1989, the Australian Postal Corporation Act established Australia Post as a self-funding entity, heralding a new direction in property management, including a move away from the larger more traditional buildings, towards smaller, shopfront-style post offices. With the advent of new digital technology requiring smaller spaces, Telstra (originally Telecom) also took a new direction in property management by withdrawing from larger telephone exchanges and former post offices, to smaller, more cost-efficient premises. For much of its history, the post office has been responsible for a wide variety of community services including mail distribution, an agency for the Commonwealth Savings Bank, electoral enrolments, and the provision of telegraph and telephone services. The town post office has served as a focal point for the community, most often built in a prominent position in the centre of town, close to other public buildings, creating a nucleus of civic buildings and community pride. Over the last 150 years, telecommunications has played a central role in developing lines of communication within Australia, has been important in eliminating Australia's isolation from the rest of the world, and has therefore played a major role in the development of the local, regional and national economies. =Wollongong East Post Office= Wollongong's first government post office was constructed in in Market Street, formalising the postal service that had been operating in Wollongong since 1832 when the first postmaster began working in the town. Early offices were commonly operated out of the business premises of the postmaster, the post being a part-time occupation for most early country postmasters. The building was an extension of the then telegraph office. The telegraph had arrived in Wollongong in 1862 and an office had been built in Market Street on land purchased by the Government to accommodate the telegraph office. Following the amalgamation of the post and telegraph departments in 1870, it was decided to combine both facilities in the same building. So it was then, in the mid-1870s, that the telegraph building was extended to house the post office as well. In 1882 the Market Street office was effectively rebuilt, with the addition of a new facade and a second storey. In December 1888, the local MP, Francis Woodward (Illawarra), suggested to the Postmaster General that the existing building be sold and a new office be built in a more central position. The Postal Inspector agreed to the proposal valuing the current building at £2,000 and estimated a cost of £3,300 for the purchase of a suitable site and the erection of a new office in Wollongong. The site chosen was adjacent to the Wollongong Town Hall in Crown Street, which was purchased for £900 in October 1889 after protracted negotiation with a reluctant Public Instruction Department as the vendor. Tenders for the construction of the new office were called; the lowest, from Messrs Banks and Whitehouse, for £2,953, was accepted. The Colonial Architect James Barnet finalised plans in 1890 and work on the construction began soon after. The two-storey office building was completed on 28 October 1892 under the reign of Government Architect Walter Liberty Vernon. The ground floor area included a covered entrance vestibule leading to the postal office, money order office and telegraph office. Behind the main office area was the battery room. A dining room, kitchen, scullery and laundry occupied the right wing of the building. On the first floor was the main living area for the postmaster, with five bedrooms, a drawing room and bathroom. One of the functions of the post office was timekeeping. Each day, a telegraph signal was sent from Sydney to the post office and a metal disc located on the roof over the centre of the front facade was lowered in response. The lowering of the disc was observed from Flagstaff Hill and the one o'clock cannon would be fired. The disc mechanism has since been removed and there is a flagstaff in its place. In 1914, the left wing of the building was extended to make way for the inclusion of a new telephone exchange, which involved the relocation of the battery room. In the front of the building, the rooms were reconfigured with a new public area in the former money order office, and a mailroom replaced the telegraph office on the eastern side. In 1918, more work was done on the front portion of the office. The public entrance was moved forward eliminating the vestibule area. Inside, the general office space was rearranged to accommodate a longer counter parallel to the front of the office. One internal wall was removed to create a large general office area and public space. The mailroom was moved to the public area from the 1914 design. An awning was installed at the front of the building at the same time. In , an annexe was built adjoining the post office to house new public telephones. In 1968, a new building was erected in Upper Crown Street to serve as Wollongong's main post office; the study site was re-classified as Wollongong East Post Office. In 1988, Australia Post spent $250,000 restoring the Wollongong East Post Office. The project included the removal of the 1918 awning, which was replaced by a smaller canopy over the front entrance. Internally, the counter was moved back to allow for more public space, while an extra 300 private mail boxes brought the total to 800 for the office. The Post Office continued to operate until October 2000, when it was closed as an office, and was replaced by a shopfront office within the IBM Arcade off the Mall. The building now houses a cafe and office space for various businesses.  Description  Wollongong East Post Office is a landmark building within the Crown Street streetscape, located close to the shopping mall. Completed in 1892, it is a two-storey, Victorian Free Classical building constructed in ashlar-rendered masonry with a smooth rendered base. The first floor is surmounted by a hipped, tiled roof with a moulded parapet to the front elevation. The ground floor wings and extensions have been clad in gabled and skillion corrugated Colorbond sheets which, for the most part, are concealed behind rendered parapets. Four rendered and moulded chimneys punctuate the first floor roofline. The facade is generally symmetrical about a central, recessed section of the building, which comprises the first floor balcony with a masonry balustrade, pillars and coat of arms at the centre, over the now enclosed front entry vestibule. A recent, unsympathetic steel and glass awning has been installed over the front entry. The facade has simply moulded and fluted, square pilasters separating the ground and first floor, and triple, timber sash windows located either side of the central recessed section. The first floor pilasters have more elaborately moulded capitals. There are moulded string courses above the base, at first floor level and at the first floor balustrade level, with a bracketed, moulded cornice below the parapet. The parapet steps up to a decorative pediment feature, centred over the windows, one on either side of the building. The current colour scheme for the exterior of the building is an ochre base, beige body and taupe detailing. The building has been substantially modified, particularly at ground floor level, since first constructed. The rear centre of the building, which was originally U-shaped and had a ground floor verandah servicing the western wing, has been enclosed to form the current mailroom. The eastern wing has been extended to the south for telephone exchange operations, the western masonry extension forming a new entry to the building and access to post boxes has been added, a weatherboard addition has been constructed on the western side and substantial interior fabric modifications have been undertaken. These include wall removal to both the ground and first floors and the installation of post boxes at the ground floor. The main public entry is at the centre of the front facade, with another entry from within the western extension. The front steps to the entry are concrete and the floors to the extension have been clad in modern red clay tiles. The interior of the ground floor of the Wollongong East Post Office comprises three main areas. These include the carpeted retail area and offices in the northern half of the building, the sheet-vinyl-floored mailroom, sorting room and post boxes areas at the centre rear and west side of the building, and staff facilities along the eastern side. There is modern tiling in the male and female bathrooms and cleaner's room. The ceilings to the ground floor comprise smooth plaster with a deep, moulded cornice, with exposed beams between columns and masonry walls of the retail area and mailroom. There is a square set plaster ceiling to the postal manager's office, a lower plasterboard ceiling to the windowless room south of the office with a simple coved cornice, and asbestos-cement sheet to the kitchenette area and rear staff facilities with simple timber strip cornices. Lighting throughout the ground floor is generally suspended fluorescent tubing from the modern Australia Post fitout. There is also a network of exposed air- conditioning ducting throughout the building, vents primarily inserted into ceilings and through fanlights. There are ceiling fans located in the retail area as well as the room behind the postal manager's office. Architraves appear to be original and are generally intact excepting those to the three windows on the western side of the main entry doors, which have been damaged through later fitouts. There is modern trim to later openings. Some sections of original skirting have been retained, with the remainder replaced with wide timber board painted to match. Windows to the retail area and some windows to the rear of the building appear original, timber sash windows. It appears that some of the glazing has been replaced. The front has a pair of timber French doors either side of a fixed centre door panel, the glazing has been painted over. They appear original to the 1918 enclosure of the front vestibule. Internal doors are generally later particularly to the staff facilities at the rear. There are fanlights above the postal manager's office door and above the door to the stairwell. Air-conditioning ducting has penetrated both fanlights. Walls for the ground floor are generally rendered masonry, the mailroom walls have ashlar cut render to the majority of the surfaces and there is evidence of substantial patching indicating the enclosure of this area from a former exterior space. The later southern wall has been roughly rendered. Walls to the retail area are smooth rendered and there is evidence of previous patching. There are recent partition walls from fitouts in the retail area and between the retail and mailroom areas. These have been damaged through incomplete removal. In the space between the stairwell and the office there are two blind, shallow-arched recesses that have been obscured by a partition wall. The ground floor colour scheme includes cream- coloured walls with brown trim. Two chimney breasts have been retained, one is intact with a marble surround and a cast iron grate, located in the postal manager's office, the other is in the retail area and is covered over. The original stairwell is located on the western side of the building at the centre. The stair comprises stained and varnished, turned timber posts and balusters, with a shaped rail, simply carved end brackets and sheet vinyl treads with metal strip edging. The original first floor residence of the Wollongong East Post Office comprises seven rooms off a central corridor, which runs east to west along the southern wall of the building. The northwestern corner room, centre room and southeastern corner room are carpeted. The remainder of this level is lined with linoleum sheet. The balcony floor is in good condition, lined with well sealed, lapped bituminous felt. Ceilings to the first floor are predominantly plaster with an elaborately moulded cornice around the stairwell, along the corridor and in the centre room (the former drawing room). There are square set plaster ceilings that appear recently altered in the southwestern corner room, northwestern corner room, southeastern corner room and the northeastern corner room. Ceilings to the toilet and adjacent storeroom on the eastern side (former linen room and bathroom respectively) are painted mini-orb corrugated iron. All lighting on the top floor is modern suspended fluorescent tubing in various forms with some attached pendent lights in the corridor and above the stairwell. There are no ceiling fans to the upper floor but there are air- conditioning vents installed into the ceilings of each room, excluding the southwestern corner room, the bathroom and storage room with the mini-orb ceiling. Architraves on this level appear intact and original to windows and doors, with minor damage evident from electrical work. There are high, continuous picture rails in the northeastern corner room and the centre room, except where a partition wall has been installed within the large later opening made in the western wall of the centre room. There are no other picture rails to the first floor. Original, wide, moulded timber skirting is intact and original to this floor, excepting the plain, recent boarding painted to match the original in the northwestern corner room as for the ground floor. Windows to the upper floor are original, squared timber sash, with single upper and lower panes. The timber and glass panelled French doors to the balcony also appear to be original. A former window or door to the balcony, in the northern wall of the centre room, has been substantially modified with the insertion of an intrusive air-conditioning unit. Internal doors have high, square fanlights above. With their fanlights, the internal doors are nearly the full height of the wall. Walls of the first floor are generally painted, rendered masonry, painted in a cream and brown colour scheme. Original walls have been removed from the centre of the northwestern corner room and between it and the centre room. A recent, timber-laminate partition wall has been inserted between the centre and northwestern corner rooms. Four chimney breasts have been retained on the first floor level. Two have been covered over, whereas the fireplaces remain relatively intact in the northeastern and southwestern corner rooms. There is a marble surround and cast-iron grate in the northeastern corner room and a timber surround in the southwestern corner room. All signage referring to the former use as a post office has been removed, excepting the masonry coat of arms of the centre of the first floor balcony. The surrounding streetscape comprises predominantly two to multi-storey retail and commercial buildings, primarily twentieth- century, but with some late nineteenth-century buildings. The Post Office is immediately adjacent to a two-storey Victorian commercial terrace building to the east, and the open courtyard of the three-storey Visitors Centre to the west, with a two-storey commercial building to the southwest. The concrete rear yard of the post office currently serves as car parking, enclosed by a recent steel picket fence and double gate. There are some mature, deciduous street trees in front of the post office within the paved footpaths. = Condition = The building was reported to be generally in good condition as at 12 October 2001, with the exception of peeling paint in the interior of both floors and rotting timbers in the rear weatherboard addition. The exterior form of the Wollongong East Post Office is largely intact, with modifications to the rear and western side. The interior has undergone extensive change, which has been concentrated largely on the ground floor with the introduction of larger public areas, mailroom and post box facilities and the enclosure of the front vestibule. The first floor level has also undergone some changes, but a greater extent of original fabric and layout remain. Wollongong East Post Office retains the features which make it culturally significant, which includes the overall fabric, style, form and scale of the building. The building is overall in fair to good condition, with some ceiling and wall cracking evident on the ground floor and first floor levels, some minor water damage and paint peeling. There is some evidence of previous patching. = Modifications and dates = Plans for the post office building were finalised in 1890 by the Colonial Architect's Office under James Barnet. The two-storey building was completed on 28 October 1892, and comprised offices, telegraph office, public space, battery room, dining room, kitchen, scullery and larder for the residence on the ground floor. The first floor comprised the postmaster's residence, with five bedrooms, drawing room, bathroom, linen room and balcony. Excluding the original construction period of the building, there have been four main phases of alterations and additions to Wollongong East Post Office. They are outlined as follows: * In 1914, plans indicate that the eastern wing of the building was extended with a hipped roof to the south to incorporate a new telephone exchange system, comprising an exchange room, attendants room, mechanics room and the relocated battery room. The front half of the ground floor was also reconfigured at this time. * During 1918, more work was undertaken at the front of the building. Plans indicate that this included: the enclosure of the front vestibule; relocation of the mailroom to the western side of the building; relocation of the public space to the eastern side; front of the building; and construction of an awning to the front facade. * In s the rendered masonry annexe was constructed on the western side of the building to house new public telephones, later providing access to the post boxes located on this side. The construction of the southwestern corner skillion-roofed weatherboard addition (former verandah), the removal of part of the original western rear wing, enclosure of the U-shaped open rear of the building and the removal of the ground floor verandah probably occurred some time after. * In 1988, Australia Post restored and refurbished the building by removing the 1918 awning and replacing it with a smaller, unsympathetic steel and glass canopy over the front entrance. 300 additional post boxes were installed at the post office during this time on the western side which were accessed via the s western corridor addition. The building was renamed Wollongong East Post Office in 1968, when the new building was constructed on another site. The post office ceased operations in October 2000, when it was moved to the IBM Arcade, off the Mall.  Heritage listing  Wollongong East Post Office is significant at State level for its historical associations, aesthetic qualities and social meaning. Linked with the postal service that has been operating in Wollongong since 1832, Wollongong East Post Office has been the centre of communications for the local community for over a century and reflects the needs of a growing population towards the end of the nineteenth century. The post office also provides an insight into the development of communication services in NSW. One of the last post offices that would have been designed by the Colonial Architect's Office in 1890 under James Barnet, it is a notable example of the Victorian Free Classical style and a prominent civic building in the Crown Street streetscape. Barnet was a key practitioner of the Victorian Free Classical style and was the designer of a large number of post offices across NSW between 1865 and 1890, a group which Wollongong East Post Office is part. Wollongong East Post Office is also considered to be significant to the local community's sense of place. Wollongong East Post Office was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 24 January 2003 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Wollongong East Post Office has historical significance for its role in the provision and development of postal, telegraph and telephone services throughout the State. Wollongong East Post Office is associated with the early development of Wollongong as it is linked with the postal service that has been operating in Wollongong since 1832. Wollongong East Post Office reflects the population growth of the area towards the end of the nineteenth century, which resulted in the need for an improved level of services to the local residents and the construction of the new building in Crown Street to replace the Market Street property. It has been the centre of communications for the local community for over a century. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The building appears to have been one of the last post offices designed by the Colonial Architect's Office in 1890 under James Barnet, and completed under the reign of Government Architect Walter Liberty Vernon. Wollongong East Post Office was designed by Colonial Architect James Barnet, a key practitioner of the Victorian Free Classical style of architecture. The Colonial Architect's Office under Barnet designed and maintained a large number of post offices across NSW between 1865 and 1890. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Wollongong East Post Office is aesthetically significant because it is a notable example of the Victorian Free Classical style, and makes an important aesthetic contribution to central Wollongong East as a dominant nineteenth century public building. It compares in style and form with Orange Post Office (1879) and Paddington Post Office (1885) post offices, although Wollongong East Post Office is smaller in scale. The scale, architectural style and location of the building make it a focal point within the Crown Street streetscape, endowing it with landmark qualities. The adjacent Victorian commercial terrace is architecturally sympathetic to the post office, and together, add substantially to the character of streetscape. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Wollongong East Post Office is a prominent civic building and a local landmark, and has been the centre of communications for the area for over a century. As such, it is considered to be important to the Wollongong community's sense of place. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The site may have some potential to contain archaeological information relating to the previous use of the site and the evolution of the building. However, there was insufficient evidence available to establish the degree of archaeological potential for the site. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Although not particularly rare in itself, Wollongong East Post Office is one of a small group of Victorian Free Classical style Post Offices. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Wollongong East Post Office is part of the group of purpose-designed, nineteenth-century post offices in NSW, designed by the Colonial Architect's Office under James Barnet and although small in scale to comparable post offices, is a fine example of its type.

During a musical career spanning several decades, he served as concertmaster for four major American orchestras, most notably the Cleveland Orchestra from 1995, until he was dismissed in 2018. He also played with the Cleveland Quartet, which won a Grammy Award for Best Chamber Music Performance in 1997. He was a longtime member of the faculty at Cleveland Institute of Music until his resignation in 2018, following allegations of sexual misconduct.  Early life and education  William Preucil was born on January 30, 1958 in Dearborn, Michigan, to a musical family. His mother, father, and various siblings played violin, while other family members played the harp, the horn, and the cello. Preucil started playing the violin at the age of five, initially studying with his mother. At the age of 16, he graduated with honors from the Interlochen Center for the Arts. He later entered the Indiana University School of Music, where he earned a Performer's Certificate under the tutelage of Josef Gingold. He also studied with Zino Francescatti and György Sebők.  Career  In 1982, Preucil became the concertmaster of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra; he had previously served as the concertmaster of the Utah Symphony and the Nashville Symphony. He appeared as soloist with the orchestra in 70 performances of 15 different violin concertos. In 1989, Preucil left the Atlanta Symphony to become the first violinist of the Cleveland Quartet; he would remain so until the quartet's disbanding seven seasons later. During his tenure with the ensemble, Preucil won a Grammy Award for Best Chamber Music Performance in 1996 for a recording of John Corigliano's String Quartet. He also recorded the complete Beethoven string quartets, as well as chamber works by Haydn, Mozart, Schubert, and Brahms, for the Telarc label. In 1995, Preucil became the concertmaster of the Cleveland Orchestra, serving until his termination in 2018. He regularly appeared with the orchestra as soloist in concertos, and also has appeared as soloist with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra, Minnesota Orchestra, Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra, and the Taipei Philharmonic Orchestra. Each summer, Preucil also served as the concertmaster of the Mainly Mozart Festival Orchestra. Preucil is currently the violinist of the Lanier Trio, which has recorded the complete Dvořák piano trios and the trios of Mendelssohn and Paulus. Preucil was a longtime faculty member of the Cleveland Institute of Music and was serving as Distinguished Professor of Violin upon his resignation in 2018. Preucil also served as Distinguished Visiting Lecturer at Furman University before being terminated in 2018. He also previously served on the faculties of the University of Georgia and the Eastman School of Music.  Sexual misconduct allegations  On July 26, 2018, graphic allegations of Preucil committing acts of sexual misconduct were published in The Washington Post. Preucil's employers swiftly reacted in wake of the revelations. On July 27, 2018, André Gremillet, the Cleveland Orchestra's executive director, announced that the orchestra was suspending Preucil with pay and investigating the claims made in the Washington Post. Additionally on July 27, Paul Hogle, the president and executive director of the Cleveland Institute of Music, released a statement saying that while he declined to comment on details in the article, the school is \\"deeply troubled\\" by the allegations and has \\"zero tolerance\\" for behavior that puts its students at risk. According to a spokeswoman for the Cleveland Institute of Music, the school had begun to review the situation internally. On July 28, 2018, Preucil resigned from the faculty of the Cleveland Institute of Music and was dismissed from his post at Furman University. On August 16, 2018, the Orchestra announced that it had hired the Debevoise & Plimpton law firm to conduct an independent investigation of Preucil, including the claims made in The Washington Post. The investigation was overseen by a special committee consisting of five members from the Orchestra's Board of Trustees. During the course of the investigation, more than 70 people were interviewed, and Preucil himself was interviewed by the investigators on October 18, 2018. In that interview, Preucil admitted to \\"engaging in sexual contact with three female students during or after lessons,\\" but refused to answer a number of other questions, \\"which largely focused on sexual activity with women who had not already been identified in the press.\\" The investigation concluded that Preucil used his position to entice female students to one-on-one situations where he engaged in sexual misconduct, and used his position in the classical community to ensure that victims remained silent. On October 24, 2018, Preucil was fired by the Cleveland Orchestra following its investigation.  Personal life  Preucil was married to the violinist Gwen Starker-Preucil, daughter of the famed cellist János Starker. They divorced in December 2017. His daughter, Alexandra Preucil, is also a violinist; she previously served as Assistant Concertmaster of the Cleveland Orchestra.

Early years and education Susan Marr was born in Bath, Maine, July 4, 1841. Her youth was passed in Bath, and she was educated at one of the best New England seminaries. Her parents died, while she was a girl, after which, she removed to New York City to live in the family of an uncle, a clergyman, and there had the advantages of refined and cultured surroundings. Career At an early age she married Mr. Spalding, a literary man. Residing a few years in New York, they removed to Philadelphia, where, shortly after, her husband died. She still continued living there, alternating between it and her home town, becoming involved with various subjects. Her time was passed mostly among relatives and friends in answer to the demands made upon her as nurse and counselor. Her poetical career dates back to her girlhood. Her poems were artistic productions, and she excelled in sonnet writing, ranking among the most successful sonnet writers of the day. Her work having a peculiar charm, she contributed to many prominent periodicals. Spalding was best known and least known by her poem, \\"Fate\\". The poem itself was widely copied and claimed, and its title was sometimes changed to \\"Kismet\\", but not until 1893 was Spalding's right of authorship absolutely settled. Edwin Milton Royle, who used it in his play of Friends, was inundated with letters from persons purporting to be its author, so that he placed Spalding's name upon all his programmes. The lines first appeared in print in the New York Graphic, in 1876. Spalding said,— \\"I happen to have still in my possession the note from William Augustus Croffut –one of The Graphic's editors– accepting the poem, speaking of it in the highest terms and expressing his regret that the New York Graphic could not pay for poetry, which letter has more than once quenched a too-insistent claimant. It is, by the way, the only bit of blank verse I ever wrote.\\" \\"Fate\\" was set to music by Emma Lore. Commonly, she wintered in Wilmington, Delaware, but in 1894, she made her home in Boston, and then traveled abroad. Spalding died in West Medford, Massachusetts, March 12, 1908. Style and themes According to Current Literature Publishing Company (1895):—\\"Her sonnets have been characterized by a critic as among the finest in the English language. A singular charm pervades all her verse. Its art was always sure, her methods of composition being invariably conscientious and painstaking, while its spirit –whether dealing with pathos or passion– is of rare grace and beauty. One sonnet in particular, \\"The Singers\\", fairly takes one's breath away with its pity and power.\\" According to Charles Wells Moulton (1890):—\\"There is in her poems an admirable grace and freedom, and an attractive reverence, delicacy of perception and beauty of expression. She is tender, passionate, refined and intense—a truly artistic temperament. A singular charm pervades her verses, with their exquisite art and deep, poetic pathos. It is, perhaps, as a sonnet writer that Spalding will find the highest recognition and her most enduring fame. Artistically considered, they are very nearly beyond criticism, perfect in execution, and of exquisite finish. This peculiar and difficult form of poetical composition has always possessed for her a fascinating charm. A careful study of its artistic requirements and a conscientious and painstaking habit of composition have resulted so successfully that she is considered by many competent critics as one of the best sonnet writers of the day, triumphantly refuting the oft-repeated assertion that the feminine mind cannot achieve a perfect sonnet. Aside from the value of the artistic expression, workmanship and thought, a subtle poetic essence pervades them all; they are poems in every essential quality and of the highest sense. Their peculiar charm will especially endear them to every lover of the sonnet.\\" Selected works * The wings of Icarus, 1892 References =Attribution=  * External links * Category:1841 births Category:1908 deaths Category:19th-century American poets Category:19th-century American women writers Category:American women poets Category:People from Bath, Maine Category:Writers from Maine Category:Wikipedia articles incorporating text from A Woman of the Century ","title":"Susan Marr Spalding"},{"id":"58011765","text":"Forever is a 1978 American made-for-television romantic drama film starring Stephanie Zimbalist and Dean Butler.

She was a central figure in two great scandals in 19th-century Sweden; when her future husband's brother sued him for his intending marriage to her on accusations of incest (1841–44) and when her late husband's brother refused to acknowledge her legal right to her inheritance and dower land after her late spouse (1849–56), known in history as the 'Schwerin Estate's Scandals'. Life =Early life= She was the daughter of an employee of the Royal Lottery, Lorentz August Hagberg, and Christina Carolina Schelin of Stockholm. Her mother was the mistress of the rich landowner count Curt Philip von Schwerin (1795-1849), and when Matilda Kristina's father died, she and her siblings moved from Stockholm to the estate of von Schwerin in Östergötland. Her mother was formally employed as the housekeeper of von Schwerin, but she was known to be his mistress and their relationship was a scandal: von Schwerin's brother and heir, the courtier Adolf Henning von Schwerin (1799-1878), was reportedly afraid that his unmarried, childless brother would marry his mistress. Curt Philip von Schwerin was one of the richest landowners in Sweden, owner of a number of estates such as Husby, Fyllingarum, Sverkersholm, Borkhult, Gobo, Odensgöl, Ekhammar and Åketorp. However, von Schwerin, though owner and resident on his estate, did not have financial control over his properties, as his inability to handle the inherited debts of his late owner and predecessor had resulted in his estates coming under the legal administration of his brother, an official of the royal court, who was in fact his heir. =First scandal= In 1841, Curt Philip von Schwerin announced that he would marry, not his mistress, but her daughter, Matilda Kristina. He was sued by his heir and brother Adolf Henning von Schwerin, who accused his brother of intent to commit a crime, as a marriage to the daughter of his mistress would juridically be defined as incest by the laws of prohibited degree of kinship. This led to a three year long legal process, including testimonies regarding the sexual relationship between Curt Philip von Schwerin and Christina Carolina Hagberg, before the court declared Curt Philip von Schwerin free to marry Matilda Kristina Hagberg in 1844. The legal process was a three year long scandal in contemporary Sweden. Count Curt Philip von Schwerin married Matilda Kristina Hagberg in 1844, and granted her three of his estates, Husby, Fyllingarum and Sverkersholm, as her dower lands. The marriage was described as happy but childless. =Second scandal= When her spouse died in 1849, Matilda Kristina von Schwerin inherited a fortune as well as the three estates granted her as dower lands, while the ownership of the von Schwerin family's estates was inherited by her late husband's brother Adolf Henning von Schwerin. She was immediately sued by von Schwerin, who refused to acknowledge her right to the dower estates. This second court case lasted for seven years, until the court, in 1856, acknowledged the legal right of Matilda Kristina von Schwerin to the three estate granted to her as dowers. The case was a scandal which attracted a lot of attention in contemporary Sweden, particularly within the upper classes, where the sympathies where on the side of the widow, and Adolf Henning von Schwerin made a donation of 100,000 riksdaler to Riddarhuset to soften the dislike his actions had caused his name in public opinion. =Later life= After the process had been completed in 1856, Matilda Kristina von Schwerin lived the rest of her life managing her dower estates and was one of the richest women in Sweden at the time, described as: \\"She was tender and charitable toward her subordinates, hosted a hospitable home and benefited the fortune of her siblings in the world. She left a memory of an in all aspects respectable and good person\\",Carl Fredrik Lindahl, Svenska millionärer.

He was elected to his seat in November 2018. A member of the Republican Party, he previously served as a St. Louis County, Minnesota Commissioner from 2013 to 2019. Early life and education Stauber was born on May 10, 1966 in Duluth, Minnesota, and attended Denfeld High School in Duluth. He has a bachelor's degree in criminology from Lake Superior State University, where he was a star player on the Lake Superior State Lakers men's ice hockey team. He is credited with helping lead the Lakers to victory in the playoffs and the 1988 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Championship game. Lake Superior \\"became the smallest school ever to win college hockey's biggest prize.\\" In that game, Stauber took a critical shot, described by opinion columnist Mike Mullen during Stauber's 2018 candidacy for the U.S. House of Representatives as \\"risky, arguably crafty, and inarguably illegal,\\" and by Star Tribune sportswriter John Gilbert in his 1988 story on the championship game as the moment when \\"Pete Stauber got away undetected when he straight-armed the net off its moorings during a Saints rush with 1:23 to go in regulation.\\" After winning the national championship, the team was invited to the White House, where Stauber met President Ronald Reagan, an event he has called a pivotal moment in the formation of his interest in politics. Career = Professional hockey = In 1990, Stauber signed a multi-year contract with the Detroit Red Wings. The Florida Panthers selected him from the Red Wings in the 1993 NHL Expansion Draft. After playing in the minor leagues, he retired after the 1992-93 season. Stauber and his brothers, John, Jamie, Bill, Dan, and Robb, all played hockey. Together they run an annual Stauber Brothers Military Heroes Hockey Camp, a summer program for children with parents in the military. The six are co-owners of the Duluth Hockey Company, which began as a sporting goods retailer but since 2015 has specialized in hockey-related merchandise. =Local politics= Stauber served on the Hermantown City Council for eight years. From 2013 to 2019, he served as a member of the St. Louis County, Minnesota Commission, which includes Duluth.  U.S. House of Representatives  Stauber in 2018 = Elections =  2018 general election  In June 2018, Donald Trump campaigned for Stauber in his run for U.S. Representative, making his first visit to Minnesota as president and attending his first rally to support a Republican candidate for the House of Representatives in the 2018 general election, visiting Stauber's hometown of Duluth. The 8th district had an open seat in a previously Democratic-Farmer- Labor (DFL)-held district where the last two elections were close. Partisan funders on both sides of the aisle reserved \\"millions\\" of dollars for advertising in a race widely regarded as a potential Republican pickup of a seat that had been held since 2013 by Rick Nolan. In November, Stauber defeated the DFL nominee, former Nolan aide Joe Radinovich, to become only the fifth person to represent the district in 71 years, and the second Republican to do so. He won primarily by running up his margins in the district's more conservative western portion. During his 2018 campaign, Stauber ran on a policy of allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, becoming only one of a handful of Republicans to endorse what was primarily a progressive idea. Stauber has since walked back from his campaign pledge. = Tenure = According to the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University, Stauber held a Bipartisan Index Score of 0.7 in the 116th United States Congress for 2019, which placed him 64th out of 435 members. Based on FiveThirtyEight's congressional vote tracker at ABC News, Stauber voted with Trump's stated public policy positions 90.4% of the time, which ranked him average in the 116th United States Congress when predictive scoring (district partisanship and voting record) is used. On September 30, 2020, Stauber hosted Trump in a visit to his district, attending a rally of about 3,000 people at the Duluth International Airport.

It aims to decompose sources of phenotypic variation into three categories: additive genetic variance (A), common (or shared) environmental factors (C), and specific (or nonshared) environmental factors plus measurement error (E). It is widely used in genetic epidemiology and behavioural genetics. The basic ACE model relies on several assumptions, including the absence of assortative mating, that there is no genetic dominance or epistasis, that all genetic effects are additive, and the absence of gene-environment interactions. In order to address these limitations, several variants of the ACE model have been developed, including an ACE-β model, which emphasizes the identification of causal effects, and the ACDE model, which accounts for the presence of dominant genetic effects.

I like the cast. I like the premise. I like the Shaw Brothers vibes and that faint odor of tokusatsu I'm picking up on, too.\\" He suggests the show is a \\"guilty pleasure\\" but is concerned about the B-stories and side characters, which he says feels padded out.

In both the 1961 film adaptation and the 1986 sequel, Felson was played by Paul Newman. Parker started playing pool at the age of nine when his father, a school superintendent, bought a used pool table. In high school, he acquired the nickname \\"Fast Eddie\\" for his speed in football and basketball. In Kansas City, he met six-time world champion Bennie Allen, who became the teenager's mentor. Parker later said, \\"I never had any idea I was going to turn professional and shoot for money until I started studying with Benny Allen.\\" He made a living from the game, but did not get rich. According to him, his biggest win was $30,000 playing three-cushion billiards sometime in the 1950s, but his backer got $18,000 of that. During his travels, in Louisville he befriended Walter Tevis, then a young man working his way through college.

Biography  Jemia reports that because she was born into a conservative family, she was immensely inspired by the feminist works of Simone Du Beauvoir as a teenager. Jemia's mother was illiterate and her family stuck to strict gender roles. She was one of the first in her family to complete advanced studies. As soon as the ATFD was created, she joined and eventually became the president of the organization. ATFD focuses on trying to curb issues of violence against women (such as making incest easier to prosecute and adopting more humane interview tactics when interviewing children). Their secondary, though also important focus is to increase the codified rights of women who are married (increase property rights, let women also be the legal guardian of their children, etc.).

Contents The Arduin Adventure is an introduction to fantasy role- playing / adventure gaming. Arduin Adventure is an introductory Arduin set, including a simplified version of the Arduin Grimoire trilogy using the 2nd- edition rules. Publication history Arduin Adventure was written by David A. Hargrave, with a cover by Greg Espinoza, and was published by Grimoire Games in 1981 as a boxed set containing a 64-page book, three cardstock artifact sheets, three character sheets, and dice; the 64-page book was also sold separately. The Arduin Adventure was originally planned for release in Christmas of 1980, but it ran into a setback when the typesetters refused to lay out the game's numerous tables, so it was not until early 1981 that the game actually appeared. While the Arduin Grimoires depended on the original Dungeons & Dragons game as the foundation of its own mechanics, The Arduin Adventure turned Arduin into a truly standalone game system. The Arduin Adventure focused on teaching roleplaying to novice gamers. Reception Clayton Miner reviewed The Arduin Adventure for Pegasus magazine #3 (1981), and stated that \\"The Arduin Adventure is a project that shows a lot of thought and effort before production, and is definitely a useful item for any gamer who is brand new to role player. This item may even be useful for more experienced gamers who are interested in using the Arduin Trilogy, but are having problems understanding new rules.\\" Mike Kardos reviewed The Arduin Adventure in The Space Gamer No. 52. Kardos commented that \\"I would recommend Arduin to those who would like to add some of the rules to their campaign. For a few more dollars, you could buy a better and more complete fantasy role- playing game.\\" Shannon Appelcline commented that The Arduin Adventure, one of the two final, professional, boxed products, contributed to Grimoire Games \\"looking like a gaming company really finding its feet. However, The Arduin Adventure was something more: it marked a new direction for Arduin itself.\\" He noted that \\"This product also fulfilled some of Hargrave's desire for a 'new game' that he'd written about when he finished The Runes of Doom. He hadn't wanted to get away from Arduin so much as from D&D.; Though the Arduin Adventure game system was still clearly D&D-derived;, it was a first step away that introduced some new rules, most notably a totally new initiative system called 'CF' (coordination factor). This movement away from D&D; was a path that Hargrave would continue walking for the rest of his life.\\" He felt that \\"The general organization of The Arduin Adventure — with one and two-page chapters each covering a basic concept — was quite innovative and definitely ahead of its time.\\" Appelcline concluded that \\"The Arduin Adventure wasn't well-received by the industry at the time. By 1980 or 1981, a bare-bones not- quite-retroclone of OD&D; wasn't that exciting — except to Arduin players, of course, who had long needed this skeleton to hang their games upon. If anything, the reception has cooled since then. Whereas The Arduin Trilogy is still appreciated and respected for its gonzo imagination and the Arduin Dungeons for their unforgiving nature, The Arduin Adventure is very much an artifact of its time.\\" Reviews *Different Worlds #13 (Aug., 1981) References Category:Arduin Category:Fantasy role-playing games ","title":"The Arduin Adventure"},{"id":"58012317","text":"On Safari is a 2016 album by American southern rock band The Kentucky Headhunters.

Gameplay Moon Base Clavius is a science fiction combat game designed by Kerry Anderson and released by Task Force Games in 1981. The setting is the American lunar colony in Clavius Crater in the mid-21st century. One player, playing the Soviet Lunar Army, attacks the second player's Air Force at Clavius Moon Base. The game provides three scenarios that simulate the various phases of the attack: initial assault; attacks on the colonies within Clavius Crater; and landing of the American marines. A fourth scenario is the campaign game that links the three shorter scenarios together into one ongoing game. =Components= The components of the game are: * 108-die cut cardboard counters * 16\\" x 21\\" map * 18-page rulebook =Combat= This game uses a \\"shoot and move\\" sequence (each of the active player's units shoots first, then moves). The range of most weapons is one hex. To resolve combat damage, the attacker's combat strength is cross-indexed against the defender's type of terrain, resulting in a target number. If the attacker can equal or better the target number on two six-sided dice, the target is destroyed; any result lower than the target number leaves the target untouched. There are tactical nuclear weapons in the game that affect one hex; after the attack, the target hex cannot be entered for one turn. =Movement= Most infantry units can move 10 hexes per turn, although various types of terrain can slow units down; infantry can use rocket-powered backpacks at a cost of 1 hex of movement per turn to negate all terrain costs. Units cannot move through an enemy unit's zone of control (the six hexes surrounding the unit) unless they pay an extra movement point to ignore the zone of control. Units crossing through an enemy's zone of control in this way need not attack the enemy unit. American units can use the monorail system to move unlimited distances, although they cannot use the monorail to move through an enemy unit's zone of control. Reception In the June 1982 edition of The Space Gamer (No. 52) W.G. Armintrout thought the game was stacked against the Russian attackers, and concluded, \\"\\"Moon Base Clavius is a simple, fun game. If it were balanced I would recommend it. It isn't, so I can't.\\" In the May 1983 edition of Dragon (Issue 73), Tony Watson was disappointed. \\"The situation seems to be one that could be dealt with in a very exciting manner, but the game comes off rather flat. While the combat system is nicely crafted, it’s not very decisive, and the game generally turns into a series of little slugfests.\\" Watson also found the third stage of the combat, the arrival of the Marines, to be \\"the biggest disappointment... They arrive with too few turns left in the game to be of much use.\\" Watson concluded with a thumbs down, saying, \\"The idea behind Clavius is a good one, but the game begs for some chrome, something to spice it up meaningfully. As is, it quickly becomes a dull exercise.\\" In the Fall 1983 edition of Ares (Issue 15), Kim Paffenroth found the game boring. He disagreed with the concept of being able to ignore terrain and zones of control, which resulted in an even sameness for all units, and made defensive strategies superfluous. Although Paffenroth found the combat rules \\"somewhat better\\" than the movement rules, the result was a generally uninteresting series of sorties. He concluded, \\"Moon Base Clavius is a pretty sorry game.\\" References Category:Board games introduced in 1981 Category:Task Force Games games ","title":"Moon Base Clavius"},{"id":"58012333","text":"Helen Buttes are two prominent summits near the western edge of the North Cascades, in Skagit County of Washington state. It's located four miles northwest of Marblemount, Washington in the Noisy-Diobsud Wilderness. It is situated on land administered by the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. The nearest higher peak is Diobsud Buttes, to the north. Precipitation runoff from Helen Buttes drains into tributaries of the Skagit River. Climate Helen Buttes is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below or above . During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

Milenković subsequently left the party and is now state secretary in Serbia's ministry of education, science, and technological development. Early life and private career Milenković was born in Žitorađa, then part of the Socialist Republic of Serbia in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. He has lectured at the University of Niš Faculty of Arts since 2004.MARKO MILENKOVIĆ, Otvoreni Parlament, accessed 27 July 2018. Political career Milenković received the 246th position (out of 250) on the Radical Party's list in the 2000 Serbian parliamentary election. The party won twenty-three seats, and he was not included in its assembly delegation.Избори за народне посланике Народне скупштине одржани 23. децембра 2000. године и 10. јануара 2001. године, ИЗБОРНЕ ЛИСТЕ (Српска радикална странка – др Војислав Шешељ) , Republika Srbija - Republička izborna komisija, accessed 17 February 2017. (From 2000 to 2011, Serbian parliamentary mandates were awarded to sponsoring parties or coalitions rather than to individual candidates, and it was common practice for the mandates to be awarded out of numerical order. Milenković could have been awarded a mandate despite his low position on the list, although in the event he was not.)Serbia's Law on the Election of Representatives (2000) stipulated that parliamentary mandates would be awarded to electoral lists (Article 80) that crossed the electoral threshold (Article 81), that mandates would be given to candidates appearing on the relevant lists (Article 83), and that the submitters of the lists were responsible for selecting their parliamentary delegations within ten days of the final results being published (Article 84).

The results of the election were initially inclusive, although the Radicals ultimately remained in opposition. The Radical Party experienced a significant split later in 2008, with several members joining the more moderate Serbian Progressive Party under the leadership of Tomislav Nikolić and Aleksandar Vučić. Milenković remained with the Radicals. Serbia's electoral system was reformed in 2011, such that parliamentary mandates were awarded in numerical order to candidates on successful lists. Milenković received the eleventh position on the Radical Party's list for the 2012 Serbian parliamentary election, in which the party fell below the electoral threshold to win representation in the assembly.Избори за народне посланике Народне скупштине, 6. мај 2012. године, ИЗБОРНЕ ЛИСТЕ (СРПСКА РАДИКАЛНА СТРАНКА - ДР ВОЈИСЛАВ ШЕШЕЉ) , Republika Srbija - Republička izborna komisija, accessed 11 April 2017.

Europe, Asia, and the Middle East all saw improvements on prior construction techniques, contributing to the Age of Discovery. As a result, the introduction of these technologies in the production of naval vessels was critical as they allowed nations that utilized these advancements to ascend to a state that could expand its influence at a far greater range. In military engagements, the exploration of new lands and potential colonies, or the transportation of goods for trade, better shipbuilding techniques coincided with prosperity. It is during this time that the practice of naval architecture appeared, as skilled designers could produce designs that had an enormous impact in ship performance and capabilities. History In the Middle Ages that preceded the early modern era, shipbuilding mainly utilized clinker building techniques, in which wooden hull planks were laid in an overlapping fashion so that they are both easier to construct and is lighter. A common form of a clinker-built ship is Nordic longship associated with the vikings. These vessels had the advantage of allowing a certain degree of twisting. However, carvel construction techniques, which involve hull planks being laid smoothly next to each other, allowed for much larger vessels that displaced more water, allowing for a much larger cargo capacity, which is necessary for long distance maritime travel. Carvel Planking Texts for Sailboats—Richard Joyce Montana Tech European designs A popular design of European origin is the carrack, which utilizes carvel construction techniques, which allowed boats to increase in size dramatically, far past that which is capable with clinker building techniques. Seen throughout the 14th and 15th century, these ships were used for trade between European powers and their foreign markets. The carrack featured anywhere from three to four masts, dominating ship designs until it was superseded by the galleon in the 16th century. The galleon featured a similar design to the carrack as it involved multiple sails and was much larger than vessels before it. With multiple decks, these ships allowed for both military and commercial use as the large cargo space allowed for the transportation of goods and multiple decks allowed for a large armament of cannons. This design saw a great amount of usage as European powers established overseas colonial empires. The Dutch fluyt ship could be recognized as a similar design to a galleon due to its pear-shaped hull. A common feature of European designs was the consideration for a large degree of armament as colonial powers had to defend from both aggressive rival European traders and pirates seeking to plunder goods. Asian designs Many of the ships that were developed in Asia were characterized by a series of traits. For example, flat-bottomed craft was often prevalent in many Chinese vessels as they are adapted for navigating in the shallow waters of the rivers that are common in China. For example, the Chinese treasure ship, known for its usage during Zheng He's seven voyages to bring distant goods and establish political and economic relationships with foreign powers. The most prevalent ship design originating from Asia during this era was the junk, which was developed centuries earlier in Ancient China during the Han dynasty. Known for its battened sail and close to the water line stature, junks saw usage in both shallow waters and extensive ocean voyages. Middle Eastern designs Largely due to the absence of a large, oceanic body of water situated by the Middle East, most shipbuilding designs reflected that of shallow water vessels or iterations meant to prepare the ship for deep-sea voyage. The dhow was a long- hulled boat that was utilized for trading extensively in the Islamic world. In the early modern era, Middle Eastern shipbuilding stagnated for the most part. However, dhows did receive a variety of adjustments in order to suit the goals of global trade of this time period. The baglah allowed for greater range as it was a dhow scaled up to include a greater number of sails and larger cargo hold. These modifications to the traditional dhow allowed it travel much further, even as far as the Spice Islands. North and South American designs During this time, indigenous populations were limited to basic vessels that were constructed in previous eras. However, colonizing Europeans powers utilized their ship technology to traverse the Atlantic Ocean to access the New World.

The current official goal of the Marine Laboratory is to study marine environmental systems and conservation utilizing the resources of the facility's proximity to the ocean. It is a member of the National Association of Marine Laboratories and the Marine Sciences Education Consortium.  History  Duke Marine Lab circa 1981 The main campus of Duke University is not in close proximity to the ocean, but with the Marine Laboratory campus, the University is able to conduct hands-on oceanographic studies. The site for the laboratory was selected in the early 1930s, with the first building completed by 1938. The original intention of the facility was to be a summer training facility and research facility for the university. By 1963, the facility had reached national recognition for its resources. At the time 75% of students and 40% of researchers came from other universities than Duke. Sylvia Earle, a renowned oceanographer and pioneer of Jacques Cousteau's AquaLung Scuba device, received her M.S. and Ph.D. from Duke in 1956 and 1966, and has a connection to the Marine Laboratory. In 1990, the laboratory assumed much of the research of Fairleigh Dickinson University's West Indies Laboratory for Underwater Research in St. Croix, Virgin Islands after Hurricane Hugo damaged the St. Croix facility. Cindy Lee Van Dover was named the first female-director of the center in 2007. She has initially worked at the laboratory in the 1970s. On June 5, 2017, the Marine Laboratory participated in a green-illumination protest with other buildings at Duke in support of the Paris Climate Accords along with similar actions at Harvard, Stanford, Yale, Columbia, and MIT.  Facilities and ships  Since its inception in 1938, the campus has expanded significantly to include wet and dry laboratories as well as a fleet of research ships. = Land-based facilities =  Research facilities  * \\"Lab 1,\\" in continuous operation since 1938, contains running sea-water tables * Marguerite Kent Repass Ocean Conservation Center \\"Green Marine Lab\\" * Marine Conservation Molecular Facility (MCMF) * Orrin Pilkey Laboratory * Bookhout Research Laboratory * Pearse Memorial Library and associated computer equipment  Support facilities  * Dormitory Capacity for 142 Persons (92 Students) * Dining Facilities * Boathouse Lounge * Student Center = Ocean vessels (former and current) = * The Eastward * Cape Hatteras * R/V Richard Barber * R/V Kirby-Smith * Various Skiffs * Unnamed Future Vessel (2018).

Scutellum on heteropteran (no. 26) Naming The object was first described by Gómez-Gálvez et al. in a paper entitled Scutoids are a geometrical solution to three-dimensional packing of epithelia, and published in July 2018. Officially, the name scutoid was coined because of its resemblance to the shape of the scutum and scutellum in some insects, such as beetles in the subfamily Cetoniinae. Unofficially, Clara Grima has stated that while working on the project, the shape was temporarily called an Escu-toid as a joke after the biology group leader Luis M. Escudero.Supplementary Movie from Since his last name, \\"Escudero\\", means \\"squire\\" (from Latin scūtārius = shield-bearer), the temporary name was modified slightly to become \\"scutoid\\".  Appearance in nature  A beetle with a scutellum, for which the shape was officially named. Epithelial cells adopt the \\"scutoidal shape\\" under certain circumstances. In epithelia, cells can 3D-pack as scutoids, facilitating tissue curvature. This is fundamental to the shaping of the organs during development. > \\"Scutoid is a prismatoid to which one extra mid-level vertex has been added. > This extra vertex forces some of the \\"faces\\" of the resulting object to > curve.

As epithelial tissue bends or grows, the cells have to take on new shapes to pack together using the least amount of energy possible, and until the scutoid's discovery, it was assumed that epithelial cells packed in mostly frustums, as well as other prism-like shapes. Now, with the knowledge of how epithelial cells pack, it opens up many new possibilities in terms of artificial organs. The scutoid may be applied to making better artificial organs, allowing for things like effective organ replacements, recognizing if a person's cells are packing correctly or not, and ways to fix that problem.

História da Música Portuguesa (History of Portuguese Music). Universidade Aberta, 1992. p. 105. . as being among Portugal's \\"most outstanding eighteenth-century composers.\\" He was born in Senhor da Pedra near Óbidos to Manuel Gonçalves dos Santos and Vitória Luísa and entered Lisbon's Royal Patriarchal Music Seminary (Real Seminário de Música da Patriarcal de Lisboa)The seminary was established in Lisbon in 1713 by King João V and located in a building next to the Ribeira Palace and Royal Chapel. This reflected in part his desire to advance music expression in Portugal along with his interest in the development of music within the context of liturgy in his Royal Chapel and beyond. He had a particular admiration for Italian music of the period, along with other aspects of its art and architecture, an explanation of why he paid for Portuguese composers and musicians to study there and imported Italians such as Domenico Scarlatti, Giovanni Giorgi and Davide Perez to Lisbon. (See Stein, Louise K. \\"The Iberian Peninsula.\\" The Late Baroque Era: Vol 4. From The 1680s To 1740, edited by George J Buelow. Macmillan Press, 1993. p. 428. ). The seminary continued as Portugal's principal music educator until the establishment of the National Conservatoire of Lisbon (Conservatório Nacional de Lisboa) in 1836.King João V's inclination towards things Italian was more complex than just an interest in its arts. Well summarised in his phrase \\"To make of Lisbon a new Rome\\", his Catholic Church adherence led him to import Roman liturgy and ritual and to send Portuguese clergy to Rome to be trained in their use. (See d'Alvarenga, João Pedro. “‘To make of Lisbon a new Rome’: The Repertory of the Patriarchal Church in the 1720s and 1730s.” Eighteenth Century Music, Vol. 8/2, 2011. pp. 179–214., Accessed 5 August 2018. on 24 June 1754. After graduating on 1 January 1763, Santos accepted an offer to remain on staff to teach solfège and was later appointed as professor (mestre) of harmony, counterpoint and composition. He continued teaching there for the remainder of his life. From 1768, parallel to his work within the seminary, he was also engaged as a singer, organist, composer and conductor at the Royal Chapel (Capela Real).Cardoso, p. 304. Of his teaching skills, one of his students, André da Silva Gomes described Santos as \\"wise and experienced\\" then adding that his command of fugue writing was \\"outstanding … and singular\\",Cardoso, p. 304. while Nancy Lee Harper in her survey of Portuguese keyboard music said he was \\"noted for his Figured Bass rules of accompaniment.\\"Harper, Nancy Lee. Portuguese Piano Music: An Introduction and Annotated Bibliography. Scarecrow Press, 2013. p. 25. . According to musicologist Robert Stevenson, Santos' own composition style was strongly influenced by Neapolitan opera composer Davide Perez who taught him at the seminary,Stevenson, Robert. \\"Santos, José Joaquim dos.\\" The Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, edited by Stanley Sadie. Macmillan Publishing, 1980. Vol. 16, p. 485. . and commenting about Santos' overall approach, Enrico Ruggieri says in his thesis, \\"He was renowned as master of the stile antico, however he composed music in concertato style as well.\\"Ruggieri, Enrico.

Looking specifically at Santos' 1792 setting of the Stabat Mater, Ruggieri noted that \\"the composition is built around the formal structure of a cantata sacra da camera that belongs to the style of the Neapolitan tradition of composers such as Alessandro Scarlatti or Giovanni Battista Pergolesi.\\"Ruggieri, p. 8. What has been described by musicologist Ricardo Bernardes as \\"the well-known process of Italianization of musical practices begun in the reign of King João V\\" is clearly demonstrated here.Bernardes, Ricardo.

Apart from two secular eclogues which were performed respectively in 1786 and 1787 at the Lisbon Academy of Sciences (Academia das Ciências de Lisboa) for its celebrations of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, the remainder of Santos' known works were written for liturgical use and performed in Portugal and Brazil. These include 5 settings of the Mass, 2 of the Te Deum, a Credo, a complete Vespers, 25 individual Psalms, 21 Anthems, Motets and Antiphons, 4 of the Miserere, 1 of Holy Week Matins and 1 of the Holy Week Responsories. The vocal forces vary from 4 to 8 voices plus soloists in some works, and always with accompaniment by organ, orchestra, organ and orchestra, or various smaller combinations of solo instruments.Stevenson, p. 485.

He was a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Early life, education, and career Born in Kentucky, Thurman moved to Lehi, Utah in 1870, at age 20. His older brother George W. Thurman was Lehi City Attorney at the time, but was shot and killed at a new year's eve party in 1871. The younger Thurman studied at Brigham Young Academy and Deseret University (later the University of Utah).Richard Van Wagoner, \\"Mayor Samuel R. Thurman, Lehi’s Ninth Mayor\\". Thurman married Isabella Karren, a native of Lehi. He worked as a school teacher and also studied law. In 1879 he was admitted to the practice of law in Utah, and then traveled to the University of Michigan where he earned a law degree. He was part of a significant number of Utah Latter Day Saints going to study law at the University of Michigan in this time period.James H. Backman. LDSW Attorneys: Approachhing the Modern Era. p. 1 Political career In February 1881, shortly after his return from Ann Arbor, Thurman was elected mayor of Lehi, Utah. He was reelected mayor in 1882, but in November 1882 resigned as mayor and moved to Provo to practice law full time. In 1884 he formed a partnership with David Evans Jr. In 1886 Evans became an assistant U.S. attorney, and Thurman formed a partnership with George Sutherland. They later included William H. King as their third partner. In the early 1890s, the partnership included Edgar A. Wedgwood, who later served as adjutant general of the Utah National Guard. From 1882 until 1890 Thurman was a member of the Utah Territorial Legislature. Also in the 1880s Thurman became involved in trying to form the Democratic Party in Utah. He was the party nominee for Territorial Delegate to Congress, losing to the People's Party candidate, John T. Caine. In 1887 Thurman became a polygamist by marrying his second wife Victoria Adelaine Hodgart. He was arrested for unlawful cohabitation in 1889, but left on a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to England before he was prosecuted. He was made an assistant U.S. attorney in 1893 by President Grover Cleveland. In 1895 he was a delegate to the Utah Constitutional Convention and one of the strong advocates, along with Republican John Henry Smith, of the vote for women in that convention. Thurman also \\"eloquently pleaded for reducing the twelve- person jury as an economy measure that would not jeopardize justice for the accused\\".Jean Bickmore Whit, The Utah State Constitution: A Reference Guide (1998), p. 11. For much of the next twenty years Thurman was chair of the Utah Democratic Party. He moved to Salt Lake City in 1906 where he formed the partnership of Wedgewood, Thurman and Irvine that specialized in irrigation law. He also from 1893 to 1912 worked in the legal department of the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad. Judicial career In 1916 Thurman became a member of the Utah Supreme Court, and was made Chief Justice of that court in 1927.

It was established in 1995 and was published by Routledge. The last editor-in-chief was Andrew Maier (University of Cincinnati). History The journal was established in 1995, and was originally published by Maney Publishing. Its founding editor-in-chief was Joseph LaDou (University of California, San Francisco), who initially spent between $50,000 and $75,000 of his own money each year to keep publishing the journal. David Egilman (Brown University) replaced LaDou as the journal's editor-in-chief in 2007. As of 2009, it was the official journal of the International Commission on Occupational Health. Along with the rest of Maney's portfolio, the journal was acquired by Taylor & Francis in 2015, which will stop publishing it at the end of 2018. Recognition A 2000 article in Occupational and Environmental Medicine identified the International Journal of Occupational and Environmental Health as one of the eight most prominent journals in the occupational health field. Epidemiologist David Michaels told ProPublica in 2017 that the journal was one of the few publications where \\"scientists whose work is independent of the corporations that manufacture chemicals\\" could publish their research, adding, \\"The silencing of that voice would be a real loss to the field.\\" Editorial board controversy Shortly after acquiring the journal in 2015, Taylor & Francis angered the editorial board by appointing Andrew Maier as the journal's new editor-in-chief without consulting the board. In an April 2017 letter to Taylor & Francis, the board's 22 members called attention to their concerns about some of the publisher's recent practices. The editors stated in the letter that, had they been consulted, they probably would not have approved of Maier's appointment, citing the tendency of his research to reach conclusions favorable to entities with conflicts of interest in the topic. The editorial board members also criticized Taylor & Francis for retracting a paper by Egilman with no explanation. The following month, Taylor & Francis managing director Ian Bannerman responded to the letter, claiming that he had consulted editorial board member Jukka Takala before offering Maier the position of editor-in- chief. Takala, who had signed the original letter, told Retraction Watch that, in fact, he had not been contacted prior to Maier's appointment. In November 2017, the editorial board sent a letter to the National Library of Medicine asking for the journal to be removed from MEDLINE. Later that month, the entire board resigned in protest. In their letter sent to Bannerman, the editors cited Taylor & Francis' appointment of Maier as editor-in-chief, as well as the company's unexplained retraction of Egilman's paper, as among the reasons for their resignation.

Before World War II, Korea was united for over a thousand years and known as Goryeo and Joseon. After colonisation by Japan from 1910 to 1945, Korea was divided into two countries along the 38th parallel (now the Korean Demilitarized Zone). North Korea was administered by the Soviet Union in the years immediately after the war, and South Korea was administered by the United States. North Korea invaded South Korea in 1950, beginning the Korean War. The war ended in a 1953 stalemate. After the war, despite South Korean president Syngman Rhee's disagreement with the United States' pursuit of a ceasefire with China and the separation of North and South Korea under US-led United Nations intervention, the two Koreas were divided on July 27, 1953. After the 1954 Geneva Conference, Rhee hoped for reunification under the United Nations before his resignation in 1960.\\"Biographies: Syngman Rhee\\" . The Department of Defense 60th Anniversary of Korean War Commemoration Committee. Retrieved on September 28, 2017. On May 16, 1961, Park Chung-hee seized power in a South Korean military coup. During the decade, Korean reunification was advocated to revive the economies of both countries. During the 1970s, with the success of détente and Korean economic development, the countries resumed negotiations. The July 4th North–South Korea Joint Statement was drawn up, but not implemented. South Korea was governed by the Yushin Constitution, and the impetus for reunification on the peninsula ended. On August 5, 2017, China's paramount leader Xi Jinping called for Donald Trump to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue through a peaceful resolution based on mutual respect between the nations in the face of heightened military tensions. At the 2017 G20 summit the previous month, Xi reaffirmed discussion of the peninsula's peace settlement. On September 3, 2017, North Korea tested a thermonuclear weapon. The bomb was later estimated at 250 kilotons, based on a further study of seismic data. Relations between North and South Korea have warmed somewhat since then, beginning with North Korea's participation in the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea.

The declaration would be a symbolic diplomatic measure, requiring fewer judicial obstacles than a peace treaty. Another factor making a declaration more timely is the warming relationship between the two Koreas as a result of several inter- Korean summits.

Kim Jong-un departed from Pyongyang on February 23, according to images released by the KCNA news agency. It was 4,500 kilometres (2,800 mi) one way trip took about 60 hours. The train arrived in Đồng Đăng railway station of the Vietnamese border city of Đồng Đăng on Tuesday February 26, and Kim traveled to Hanoi by vehicle. U.S president Donald Trump met with Kim Jong-un on February 27–28, 2019, in Hanoi, Vietnam, in the second summit meeting between the leaders of the United States and North Korea. On February 28, 2019, the White House published that the summit was cut short and that no deal was reached, with Trump later elaborating that it was because North Korea wanted an end to all sanctions. On the other hand, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho stated that the country only sought a partial lifting of five United Nations sanctions placed on North Korea during 2016–17. U.S. President Donald Trump, South Korean President Moon Jae-in, and North Korean Leader Kim Jong-un chatting at the Joint Security Area during KOREAS-U.S. DMZ summit 2019 KOREAS-U.S. DMZ summit Trump stepping into the North Korean territory by crossing the low stone curb separating the North and South at 3:45 p.m. KST About the end of March, which was one month after the summit ended, Reuters revealed that on the second day of the summit U.S. president passed DPRK Kim a note that bluntly called for North Korea to surrender all its nuclear weapons and fuel, in similar fashion to the “Libya model,” a proposal the North Koreans had repeatedly rejected. The scheduled ceremonial luncheon was then abruptly canceled and the summit ended. Dr. Chiew-Ping Hoo, a professor at the National University of Malaysia, said that the negotiations at the Hanoi summit changed the minute John Bolton was added at the eleventh-hour to the panel. He advised to change the goal-post from the YongByon Nuclear site, to add other sites that produced weapons of mass destruction. Trump had to agree with Bolton's advice due to U.S. domestic issues, which resulted in a no-deal outcome for the summit. According to Jenny Town, Washington based, think-tank and North Korean expert, \\"it's Bolton's proposal in 2004, has been rejected more than once and, to bring it up again… would rather be insulting.” She also said that the US should have learned that this wasn't effective diplomacy, and shows they haven't learned how to properly negotiate.https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-usa-document- exclusive/exclusive-with-a-piece-of-paper-trump-called-on-kim-to-hand-over- nuclear-weapons-idUSKCN1RA2NR Former special assistant to President Ronald Reagan, and a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, Doug Bandow, President Trump was demanding unrealistically for Chairman Kim Jong Un to dismantle all his nuclear facilities, whereas Chairman Kim was only agreeing to shutting down the YongByon Nuclear facility in exchange for a partial lifting of a few UN sanctions against his country. Asking continuously for an all nukes for sanctions deal is deemed as malicious in its intent and illogical. Douglas Dillon Professor of Government at the Harvard Kennedy School, and former director of Harvard's Belfer Center, Graham T. Allison, believes that the Hanoi summit is not a whole failure, despite some public opinion, and even compared this to the Reagan-Gorbachev era. President Reagan also had to deal with negative public opinion regarding his dealings with the USSR, but he was able to remove all of the Soviet Union's intermediate nuclear-armed missiles with an INF deal. Compared to the USSR, North Korea is also communist country, but President Trump was able to deal with the top leader of North Korea, Chairman Kim, something neither Bush nor Obama were able to do in their combined 16- year term. According to Abby Bard, a research associate for Asia policy at the Center for American Progress, President Trump's and Chairman Kim's teams need critical space between them to build trust and verify the intentions between the two parties. Working level meetings between both teams are needed to arrange the details that would result in bigger bargains without miscalculations and misunderstandings. In order for the two leaders to reach a deal, their diplomatic teams need to work together.https://nationalinterest.org/blog/korea-watch/hanoi- summit-%E2%80%93-we-asked-abigail-bard-what-happens-next-us-north-korea- relations On September 10, Trump sacked the national security adviser John Bolton as he strongly disagreed with John Bolton's suggestion about applying Libyan model to North Korea nuclear deal and mentioning Muammar Gaddafi.Trump: John Bolton 'made some very big mistakes' https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFJKf8Dl48wTrump sacks national security adviser John Bolton - BBC Newsnight: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bgFWL45oWMSacked national security adviser John Bolton’s legacy of turmoil https://www.news.com.au/finance/work/leaders/sacked-national-security-adviser- john-boltons-legacy-of-turmoil/news-story/7d35044f50c60f1cbefd4e9282f44044 However, Bolton himself claims he was not sacked but resigned.John Bolton Is Fired.

Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. is a 5840+ ft summit near the western edge of the North Cascades, in Snohomish County of Washington state. It is located four miles south of Darrington, Washington, along the Mountain Loop Highway. It is situated in the Boulder River Wilderness on land administered by the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. The mountain was named by miners for its resemblance to an elephant. The nearest higher peak is Buckeye Peak, to the west. Precipitation runoff from Jumbo Mountain drains into tributaries of the Stillaguamish River and Sauk River. Climate Jumbo Mountain is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, p. 15 Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below or above . During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, p. 16 Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

She was elected six years after women in the United States won the right to vote, and she was also the first woman Democratic candidate for the United States Congress, running in 1940.  Early life and teaching career  Louise Holland Coe was born as Louise Holland in Bartlett, Texas, on November 26, 1894. She moved to Roswell, New Mexico during her childhood. Coe's early background and career was in public education and administration. She began teaching at rural schools. From 1916 to 1918, Coe taught classes in the Ruidoso Valley. At some point, she worked as the principal of the consolidated school system of San Patricio. In 1917, Holland was elected the Superintendent of Schools in Lincoln County; in this position, she made novel decisions for the time period, consolidating smaller schools into a larger district. In 1919 or 1920, Holland married a rancher, Wilbur Coe, who supported her political and educational ambitions. Later on, in 1938, a local newspaper stated that after she married, she \\"began to live on a ranch in the Ruidoso Valley in the White Mountains of the south central section of New Mexico. Two miles away from her ranch home was a one-room school attended only bv Spanish-American children. Teachers for this school were hard to find and none ever stayed for a full term. Motivated by this Louise Coe decided to teach here and give these children who were her friends and neighbors a better opportunity.\\"  Political career and continuing education  In 1924, Coe was elected to the New Mexico Senate as its first female senator, just four years after women won the right to vote, and just three years after women won the right to run for office in New Mexico. She represented Lincoln, Otero, Socorro and Torrance counties. She held her office from 1925 to 1941, for four consecutive terms. Coe's main focus was on education, including programs and legislation that improved the state's public education system. For 12 years, she was the chairman of the Senate Education and \\"was influential in securing legislation providing free textbooks, larger libraries, higher teacher qualifications and salaries, and designating sales and severance taxes as school revenues.\\" Outside of education, Coe sponsored legislation that would have given women the right to control their property. Coe was elected by her peers as the Senate president pro tempore from 1929 to the end of her term, the nation's first woman president pro tempore in any senate. Coe attended the University of New Mexico and graduated in 1930 with a Bachelor of Science in Education with a minor in Spanish. While at university, she joined the women's fraternity Alpha Delta Pi. In 1940, Coe ran for a position in the United States House of Representatives and was the first Democratic woman to do so. However, she lost to Clinton Presba Anderson in the primary election. After Coe left her position in the state Senate, no woman would be elected until 1965. As of 2012, Coe is still the only female president pro tempore of the New Mexico Senate.  Later life  In 1980, Mortar Board, an academic honors society, awarded Coe the Distinguished Women Award for her \\"outstanding contributions to education and government in New Mexico.\\" Louise Holland Coe and her husband Wilbur may eventually have moved to Glencoe, New Mexico, an unincorporated community nearby. This community was named in her family's honor. Through her life, she traveled to various countries, including Thailand, Japan, and India. Coe died in 1985 from unstated natural causes, at Casa Maria Health Care Center in Roswell, New Mexico. Her remains were cremated and buried at her family's private cemetery in Glencoe.

Y. Combines and Srinivasa Silver Screen. The plot revolves around the death of motorists who break a traffic rule at a particular flyover and subsequent pinning down of the culprit by an intern journalist and police inspector duo. Filmed simultaneously in Tamil and Telugu languages, it is a remake of the director's own 2016 Kannada film of the same name. The film stars Samantha Akkineni, Aadhi Pinisetty, Bhumika Chawla, and Rahul Ravindran. Principal photography commenced in February 2018 and ended in June. U-Turn is a songless film, featuring background score composed by Poornachandra Tejaswi and a promotional song composed by Anirudh Ravichander. The cinematography was handled by Niketh Bommireddy and editing by Suresh Arumugam. The film released on 13 September 2018, coinciding with the Ganesh Chathurthi festival and received a positive response from critics, becoming successful. The film was made available as a VOD at Amazon Prime Video on 25 October 2018.  Plot  Rachana (Samantha Akkineni), an intern, with The Times of India, a daily newspaper, is working on an article on the incidents at a flyover. She also has a crush on the crime reporter Aditya, whose help she seeks for research material on accidents on the flyover. She finds that each day some motorists move the concrete blocks that partition the road just to take a quick U-turn and avoid the traffic. They don’t move them back and the blocks are left to lie randomly on the road leading to many accidents. A homeless man sitting on the flyover notes down the vehicle numbers of commuters who violate the rule to take the U-turn and gives the list to Rachana. She obtains the details of the culprits using her contact in the traffic department, with the intention of confronting them for their \\"short-cut\\" and writing an article for the paper. Her attempt to meet the first person on the list goes in vain. Later the same day, the police take her into custody and accuse her of killing the same person she wanted to meet. She is shocked and tells her side of the story. Though the senior police officer rejects it, sub-inspector Pradeep Nayak finds it believable and does some investigation. It is revealed that all the persons Rachana has on her list have committed suicide. They also noticed that they have committed suicide the same day they took the wrong \\"u-turn\\". Rachana and Nayak find another number has been noted by the homeless man which is to be delivered to Rachana the next day. The duo trace the address and try to rescue the man, a lawyer, who has taken the u-turn on the same day. As nothing seems suspicious, both leave only to encounter the very death of the lawyer whom they came to rescue,who jumps off his balcony and died falling on the police car in which Nayak and Rachana were leaving. Later Rachana tries to confront the homeless man for the injuries in the fly-over. Meanwhile, she sees two young men violate the U-Turn and reports it to Nayak. Nayak locks them up in an old Police lock-up to save them. But they start fighting and eventually die under the nose of the police. With no way of finding the real cause of the death of the culprits, Rachana herself takes the wrong u-turn and waits for something to happen. The one who has been killing the culprits is a woman named Maya, because she and her daughter Aarna died in an accident due to the concrete roadblocks that were moved by the culprits in order to make way for their u-turn. Using her supernatural powers, Maya tries to kill Rachana as well. But Rachana promises to find the person who was responsible for Maya's death. Maya agrees. Rachana, with the help of Nayak, tries to find the person who moved the blocks on the day of Maya's accident. They find out the phone number and address of the guy who moved the block. Rachana writes this on a balloon and leaves it on the flyover for Maya to find. She then invites her boyfriend Aditya for dinner. During dinner she tries to call the number she found out earlier. It turns out to be Aditya's work mobile number. Devastated she confronts Aditya and informs him that due to his negligence a mother and daughter lost their lives. Aditya says it was not him who made the U-turn. He merely exchanged his bike with his friend. In the final twist, it is revealed that the guy who moved the block was Maya's own husband Ritesh. Maya's ghost is waiting in Aditya's house to kill him when Maya's husband whom Rachna has informed about the events turns up and explains to Maya that it was because of him that they lost their lives. He then tries to commit suicide by jumping from the balcony. Maya's ghost saves him and tells him that his punishment is to suffer in this world without his wife and daughter.

It was designed by Walter Liberty Vernon and built during 1885. It is also known as Le Chalet. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  =Indigenous history= At the time of European contact, the Kelly's bush area was inhabited by the Wal Umedegal Clan who spoke the Guringai language. They lived primarily on fish and shellfish, supplementing their diet when necessary with vegetables, marsupials, birds and grubs. They were also frequently observed firing the scrub both to facilitate access to the foreshore and to flush out game. Very little is known of their social structure and religious beliefs.Pitt, 2011. =Colonial history= Captain John Hunter (1737-1821) of the Sirius, charted Sydney Harbour in 1788. On 28 January 1788 he wrote in his journal: \\"A few days after my arrival with the transports in Port Jackson, I set off with a six-oared boat and a small boat, intending to make as good a survey of the harbour as circumstances would admit: I took to my assistance Mr Bradley, the first lieutenant, Mr Keltie, the master, and a young gentleman of the quarter- deck (midshipman Henry Waterhouse).\\" Hunter's meticulous chart shows 30 depth soundings around the peninsula bounded by the Parramatta and Lane Cove rivers. Hunter was Governor of the Colony from 1795-1800. He is commemorated in the name of Hunters Hill.Sherry/Hunters Hill Historical Society, 2011, p.15. In 1855 a speculative housing venture of erecting four prefabricated Swiss Cottages at Hunters Hill was underway. In this period Hunters Hill was an established French enclave, with the residence of the French consul located there at \\"Passy\\", and much of its early development was constructed by men of French descent. The prefabricated houses were advertised as \\"four splendid family residences, standing in their own grounds, of about 1 acres each\\", with \\"wood and water in abundance\\".Sherry 1989, p.48. Beverley Sherry in her study of Hunter Hill notes that this was the first planned group of houses to be built in the municipality, marking the beginning of the garden suburb character of Australia's oldest Garden Suburb. The subdivision and garden suburb development occurred in the mid to late nineteenth century, predating the formation of the Garden Suburb movement. The historic development at Hunters Hill was consistently speculative, although some of the subdivisions were undertaken to provide residences for family members.Mattingley, 2007. =Hestock= The land Hestock stands on was originally part of the Passy Estate, a landholding of considerable extent stretching from what is now Woolwich Road to Alexandra Bay between Ferry and Crescent Streets. Between 1855 and 1857 Passy, a substantial stone villa, was built for Monsieur Louis Sentis the French Consul at the time. Sentis sold shortly afterward to Edye Manning. Hestock was built in 1885 by Alfred Christian Garrick the owner of Passy. The architect was Walter Liberty Vernon, later the New South Wales Government Architect from 1890 to 1911. Vernon also designed the Hunters Hill Post Office. The house was illustrated in the Australian Builder's and Contractor's News of 18 August 1888. In 1886 John Arthur was the tenant of the house and H. B. Cotton from 1888. The house was named Le Chalet during (at least) the years 1890 to 1924. There is anecdotal evidence to suggest that it was known as Le Chalet up until 1968.Personal communications with previous occupant. According to anecdotal evidence, the service wing originally featured a timber verandah (now demolished) which had a laundry with a bricked in copper and, later, a gas copper and cement wash tubs. Adjacent to this was a wood shed and a toilet. Before the subdivision of land on the Western boundary, there were two garages and two workmen's sheds as well as a corrugated iron work water tank. The house itself has the words \\"Hestock AD 1881\\" carved into a dressed stone quoin adjacent to the entry porch. As Walter Liberty Vernon sold his architectural practise in Britain and came to Australia in 1883 the date on the house cannot be correct (as Vernon was not in Australia at that time). The house must have been constructed between 1883 (the time of Vernon's arrival in NSW) and 1888 (the years it was illustrated in the Builder's and Contractor's News). As it was occupied in 1886 it does appear that an 1885 construction date appears likely.Kemp and Johnson, 2000 Hestock was nominated for a Permanent Conservation Order in 1979 by the then owner Mr Evans. The Permanent Conservation Order was gazetted on 27 June 1980. It was transferred to the State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  Description  Hestock through the trees Hestock is a substantial two-storey sandstone residence, with verandahs on three sides. The sandstone walls are rock-faced ashlar and feature smooth dressed quoins and smooth dressed stone mullions to the windows. The house is asymmetrical, with a steeply pitched gabled slate roof. Chimneys are sandstone with pairs of unglazed terracotta chimney pots. The gable ends feature imitation half-timbering. Windows are often in groups of three. The group of three windows lighting the entrance hall to the northeast of the entry porch feature geometrically patterned leadlights. Also adjacent to the entry porch, carved into one of the dressed quoins are the words \\"Hestock AD 1881\\". The main return verandah to the front and the northeast side of the house features a slate roof with bablets featured to both sides. The rear service wing is single storey, also with a gabled slate roof and features a gabled roof vent. A stone garden wall joins the rear wall of the service wing and features a dressed top, curved dressed end and features a whimsical arrow-slit cross. Internally the walls are plastered brick and ceilings are high with, in the front section of the house elaborately moulded cornices and large ceiling roses. In the rear service wing original plain plaster ceiling without cornices survive. There is an existing modern enlarged opening between the kitchen and the family room which does not extend to ceiling height. = Condition = , the physical condition was excellent. Hestock retains a very high degree of integrity. = Modifications and dates = *1920s - possible alteration of the verandah to the front and northeastern side of the house. *1988 - construction of a two-storey timber cottage to the northwest of the house  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries As at 4 January 2013, Hestock is of State heritage significance as one of the few domestic buildings designed by eminent architect Walter Liberty Vernon who went on to become the New South Wales Government Architect from 1890 to 1911.

Prelude  On 3 July 1919, Anton Denikin issued a directive for an offensive against Moscow, planning to inflict the main blow by the Volunteer Army through Kursk, Orel, and Tula. Red Army troops conducted defensive battles on a front of some long and by the beginning of August were able to stop the advance of the Whites at Novoukrainka, Romodan, Oboyan, Liski, Borisoglebsk, north Kamyshin, Vladimirovka and Chyorny Yar. After this, the Red troops began to prepare to launch a counter-offensive.  Alignment of forces and plan of attack  By 15 August, the number of troops of the Southern Front of the Red Army, commanded by Vladimir Yegoryev, was 150,500 bayonets, 23,700 sabers, 719 guns, and 3,197 machine guns. In the fortified areas there were an extra 35,000 bayonets and sabers, 129 guns, 184 machine guns, and more than 50,000 soldiers in reserve. The AFSR forces operated under the general command of General Anton Denikin, and were composed of the Don Army, commanded by General Vladimir Sidorin; the Caucasus Army, commanded by General Pyotr Wrangel; and part of the Volunteer Army, commanded by Vladimir May-Mayevsky. The total number of these troops was 100,960 bayonets, 43,250 sabers, and 303 guns. The main blow in the upcoming offensive was planned to be inflicted on Novocherkassk and Rostov-on-Don by the left flank of the Southern Front, in particular the Special group of Vasily Shorin composed of the 9th and 10th armies and the Cavalry Corps of Semyon Budyonny – 52,500 bayonets, 14,500 sabers, 314 guns, and 1,227 machine guns. An auxiliary strike against Kupiansk was to be executed by the Special Group of Vladimir Selivachyov composed of the 8th Army, 3rd and 42nd Infantry Division of the 13th Army – 49,700 bayonets, 4,700 sabers, 268 guns, and 1,381 machine guns. The total length of the front of the offensive was . The 14th Army was to support the offensive of Selivachev's group, by attacking Lozovaya. The beginning of the counter-offensive of the Red Army was scheduled for 2–5 August, but by that time the preparation was not completed because of the slow transfer of reinforcements, reserves, weapons, ammunition and food supplies to the Southern Front. The planned grouping of troops did not provide sufficient forces and means yet to launch the attack. The White Command became aware of the impending counteroffensive and preventive measures were taken. On 10 August, the White Guard 4th Don Cavalry Corps, under Konstantin Mamontov, broke through the Red front at the junction of the 8th and 9th Armies, and started operating in the rear of the Southern Front around Tambov. The actions of Mamontov's cavalry made it very difficult for the Red Army to prepare and execute the counter-offensive.  Progress of the operations  = Actions of the Shorin group = On 14 August, the troops of the Shorin group, with the support of the Volga detachment of the Volga-Kama flotilla—16 boats, five cannodoks, one floating battery—launched an offensive against the Don Army and the Caucasian Army, which numbered 12,300 bayonets, 21,900 sabers, 93 guns, and 249 machine guns. The troops of the 10th Army in cooperation with the Cavalry corps of Budyonny conducted an offensive against Kamyshin and Tsaritsyn, while the 9th Army attacked Ust-Khopyorskaya. By the end of August, the Cavalry corps of Budyonny had defeated General Sutulov's Cossack Division and together with the 10th Army struck a blow against the White troops in the village of Serebryakovo-Zelenovskaya, capturing four armored trains. In early September, heavy fighting for Tsaritsyn unfolded. On 5–8 September, the troops of the 10th Army and units of the Cavalry Corps of the Budenny continued to attack. Under strong White fire, they stormed several times the trenches and wire fences, but due to heavy losses were forced to stop the offensive. On 9 September, White troops launched an offensive by large infantry and cavalry forces with the support of 12 batteries, armored cars and tanks against the 10th Army, and in the course of fierce fighting in several sectors forced parts of the 10th Army to retreat. By 11 September, active fighting around Tsaritsyn stopped. The command of the Southern Front decided to withdraw the Cavalry corps of Budenny from the 10th Army, in order to send him to Novokhopersk against Mamontov's Cavalry corps. At the same time, the commander of a newly formed cavalry corps, Filipp Mironov, decided independently to march to the front against the troops of Denikin. This step was seen as rebellion, and the forces of the Cavalry corps of the Budyonny were sent to suppress it. On 13 August, Mironov was arrested, and his 500 men were disarmed. The offensive of the Ninth Army developed slowly because of the stubborn resistance of the Don Army. Only by 21 August, the 9th Army troops achieved a breakthrough and began to encroach upon parts of rivers Khopyor and Don. On 12 September, the troops of the Ninth Army crossed the Khopyor River and managed to advance . Further advance down the Don Bend failed. = Selivachev group = On 15 August, Selivachev's group launched an offensive against a part of the Don Army and the right wing of the Volunteer Army, which numbered 20,500 bayonets, 9,200 sabers, 69 guns, and 208 machine guns. The main blow was inflicted by the Strike group—3rd and 42nd infantry divisions and cavalry brigade of the 13th Army, 12th, 15th, 16th, and 13th infantry divisions of the 8th Army—at the junction of the Don and Volunteer armies. The remaining divisions moved in echelons and covered the flanks. The White troops had a strong right flank and an extended center. By 27 August, the troops of the left flank of the Selivachev group had advanced , occupying Novy Oskol, Biryuch and Valuyki. On the right flank they advanced to Belgorod. In the center, after advancing , they approached Kupiansk, and came within from Kharkov. By 1 September, the group's troops reached the line of Volchansk–Kupiansk–Valuyki–Podgornoy station – north of Rossosh. However, the offensive of the Selivachev group happened without interaction with the Shorin group, along divergent lines, with put the Red troops at a disadvantage. Furthermore, the Mamontov group operated in the rear, breaking up communications and logistic support to both groups. The White Army concentrated large forces on the flanks of the Selivachev group and on 26 August, went on the offensive. From the Belgorod area to Koroch and Novy Oskol, two divisions of the 1st Army Corps under Alexander Kutepov, and the 3rd Kuban Cavalry under General Shkuro, attacked. From the Karpenkov district—Krasnoe, Samoteevka, Biryuch—the 8th Plastun and 2nd Don divisions struck. With these attacks, the White Army tried to surround the main forces of Selivachev's group and defeat them. The Red troops stubbornly defended themselves by the flanks of the 12th and 42nd Infantry Divisions, and by 15 September, retreated to the Seym River, southwest of Stary Oskol and north of Novy Oskol. The 14th Army, in order to assist the Selivachev group, attempted to launch an offensive by crossing the Seym River, but did not achieve success and retreated.  Results  The August counteroffensive of the Southern Front of the Red Army did not achieve its goals. This was due to a number of reasons : in particular the lack of forces in the offensive groups, especially cavalry, and also the diversion of an important number of forces to fight the Mamontov Cavalry. The choice of the main attack in the direction of the Don region forced the Red forces to act in an environment with a hostile attitude of the local population. The advance of the two groups of the Southern Front was carried out in separate directions and in time, this enabled the White Army to repel them separately. Nevertheless, the counteroffensive of the Red Army delayed the offensive of the Volunteer Army against Kursk and Orel, distracting the main forces of the Don Army and Caucasus Army. The Red forces also managed to maintain communications between central Russia and the eastern regions of the country, ensuring the delivery of food and reserves from the east.

It was designed and built during 1855; and assembled by German carpenters Willhelm Gross, Frederick Lemm, and Jacob Arndt. It is also known as The Bungalow (1867) and The Nora Heysen Studio. The property is privately owned. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 June 2005.  History  =Indigenous history= At the time of European contact the Kelly's bush area was inhabited by the Wal Umedegal Clan who spoke the Guringai language. They lived primarily on fish and shellfish, supplementing their diet when necessary with vegetables, marsupials, birds and grubs. They were also frequently observed firing the scrub both to facilitate access to the foreshore and to flush out game. Very little is known of their social structure and religious beliefs.Pitt, 2011. =Colonial history= Captain John Hunter (1737-1821) of the Sirius, charted Sydney Harbour in 1788. On 28 January 1788 he wrote in his journal: \\"A few days after my arrival with the transports in Port Jackson, I set off with a six-oared boat and a small boat, intending to make as good a survey of the harbour as circumstances would admit: I took to my assistance Mr Bradley, the first lieutenant, Mr Keltie, the master, and a young gentleman of the quarter-deck (midshipman Henry Waterhouse).\\" Hunter's meticulous chart shows 30 depth soundings around the peninsula bounded by the Parramatta and Lane Cove Rivers. Hunter was Governor of the Colony from 1795-1800. He is commemorated in the name of Hunters Hill.Sherry/Hunters Hill Historical Society, 2011, p.15. =The Chalet= A detailed study of The Chalet is included in \\"Fine Houses of Sydney\\" by Robert Irving, John Kinstler and Max Dupain. The following historical outline and description are largely drawn from that study. The Chalet is the only surviving residence of four prefabricated \\"Swiss Cottages\\" that were shipped from Hamburg to Sydney and erected in Hunters Hill during the gold rush period in 1854 or early 1855 by a French-speaking Swiss immigrant Etienne-Jean- Leonard Bordier-Roman shortly after his arrival in Australia. Prior to this time, Bordier and the French Count Gabriel de Milhau (exiled for his part in France's 1848 revolution) had initially settled on the Clarence River, however they were forced to abandon the venture when their workers all downed tools and headed for the NSW goldfields. The houses may have been a prototype for the 1855 Paris Industrial Exhibition that were erected in Hamburg. The Swiss or possibly Bavarian Cottage design was probably selected for its picturesque qualities, and also possibly for nationalistic reasons, as Bordier was Swiss. The four houses were erected on two whaling land grants of four acres (either side of Ferry Street) purchased by Bordier in 1855, on the Parramatta River in Hunters Hill, as a speculative housing venture. Bordier established a wharf at the end of Ferry Street, which became the suburb's first commercial gateway. A Post Office was set up next to this wharf. Hunters Hill during this period was an established French enclave, with the residence of the French consul Louis Francois Sentis, located in Hunters Hill house of \\"Passy\\" (1855-6, 1 Passy Avenue) and much of the area's early development was constructed by men of French descent. The houses were advertised as \\"four splendid family residences, standing in their own grounds, of about 1 acres each\\", with \\"wood and water in abundance\\".Sherry, 1989. Beverly Sherry in her study of Hunter Hill notes that this was the first planned group of houses to be built in the municipality, marking the beginning of the garden suburb character of Australia's oldest Garden Suburb. The subdivision and garden suburb development occurred in the mid to late nineteenth century, predating the formation of the Garden Suburb movement. The historic development at Hunters Hill was consistently speculative, although some of the subdivisions were undertaken to provide residences for family members. The cottages were constructed by three indentured German carpenters: Willhelm Gross, Frederick Lemm and Jacob Arndt. Bordier appears to have been able to speak German, the initial contract being in German and could thus instruct the workmen. One reason for importing indentured German carpenters to Sydney, and paying their board and passage, was to guarantee that the work force would not flee to the gold fields before the job was completed. Two of the three carpenters are known to have remained in NSW, Jacob Arndt in Hunters Hill, and Frederick Lemm who settled in Goulburn. Lemm established a contracting business in Sydney, building Goulburn Gaol for the NSW Government Architect. The construction of prefabricated houses and the need to import specialised tradesmen was characteristic of the 1850s Gold Rush era in Australia, which caused a shortage of specialised tradesmen and generated a demand for prefabricated buildings that could be erected rapidly. However, prefabricated buildings dating from the 1850s are quite rare in NSW, particularly buildings manufactured on the continent. Victoria retains a number of prefabricated buildings erected in the 1850s including The Heights, Aphrasia Street, Newton, Greater Geelong. This prefabricated house, one of a number imported by Frederick Bauer from Hamburg may have been manufactured by the same firm who made Bordier's houses. It is a far more substantial house, with 14 rooms and does not retain the same level of decorative detail as The Chalet, although timber fretwork could have been removed. The manufacturer of the Heights and Bordier's cottages has not been determined. Bordier was ultimately unsuccessful in selling the properties and his estate was placed in sequestration in May 1856, as a result of bankruptcy. Etienne Bordier sold the estate to Didier Joubert, returned to Switzerland in the late 1850s and died in Paris in 1861. The first of the four prefabricated houses, the house to the north of The Chalet, possibly known as Muirbank, was the first to be demolished. The land was subdivided and the house demolished by Gerald Halligan, the NSW Government Hydrographer at the start of the twentieth century. Sommerville, or the Hut was purchased by steamboat proprietor (he bought the Parramatta Steamship Co. in 1873, running 20 steamers during the years of his ownership (1875-9), was three-time Mayor of Hunters Hill, Sydney City Councillor and member of the NSW Legislative Assembly)) Charles Jeanneret, in 1857 and demolished in the 1950s. Jeanneret purchased the adjacent Wybalena estate and operated a private ferry service and a pleasure grounds in the next bay. He built a series of substantial dwellings for his family members and has left a legacy of at least 16 stone houses in Hunters Hill. The third cottage, was purchased by the Bellinghams, then the Deputy Surveyor of NSW, Robert Desmond Fitzgerald, and subsequently by the French consul who renamed it Croissy. Remnants of the garden established by Fitzgerald, whose passion was orchids, are thought to survive, the house does not, it was demolished in the 1960s. Its name is recorded in Croissy Avenue. Irving et al. note that Croissy and The Chalet were almost identical. The four houses were not named initially. The Chalet changed hands three times until it was purchased by William Jack and named \\"The Bungalow\\" in 1867. It was subsequently occupied by the City Architect William Sapsford. William Herbert Manning, a barrister purchased the house and it was renamed Yerton. He subdivided the land, creating three waterfront lots. The former driveway of The Chalet became Yerton Avenue. Three of the later names of Bordier's prefabricated houses are recorded in the street layout: Yerton Avenue, Croissy Avenue and Muirbank Avenue. Plaque commemorating Nora Heysen's occupation of the house The Chalet was purchased by Robert Black, a specialist in Tropical Diseases, and his wife, the artist Nora Heysen, in 1954. Heysen had first met Robert Black in New Guinea during World War II whilst serving as the official war artist. The house may have been selected for its Germanic detailing. From an interview in 1965 Nora Heysen said \\"Now I think I've found my own environment. The house itself is about 120 years old, in a very wandering wilderness of a garden where I can grow my own flowers for painting, and the atmosphere is peaceful and very conducive to my work.\\" The couple separated in 1972, with Nora retaining the house in Hunters Hill. Nora Heysen (1911-2003), the daughter of Sir Hans Heysen (1877-1968), was born in Hahndorf in South Australia in 1911. She settled in Sydney in 1938 and has been awarded both the Order of Australia and the Australia Council's Award for Achievement in the Arts. Nora Black was the first female winner of the Archibald prize for portraiture in 1938 at age 27, was also awarded the L J Harvey Memorial prize, Qld Art Gallery, in 1973, and is recognised as one of Australia's foremost female painters. Her works are hung in the State galleries of SA, NSW and Queensland, and regional galleries at Armidale, Ballarat, Hamilton and Newcastle and the Australian War Memorial, Canberra. Nora married Dr Robert Black in 1953, having met in New Guinea where she was Australia's first woman war artist and he a specialist in tropical medicine. After the marriage ended she continued to live in The Chalet. She often worked at her art on the back verandah. The surviving example of The Chalet from the group of (originally four) cottages in Hunters Hill remains a very rare example of the mid nineteenth century prefabrication, with the majority of such building groups, both nineteenth and twentieth century, being military buildings. Other examples of German craftsmanship survive in South Australia, notably in the Barossa Valley.  Description  =Garden= Broad steps The garden surrounds the house on the southern, western and northern sides. Its main extent is to the west. Broad sandstone steps lead from Yerton Avenue into the garden. More steps lead to the house's wide front verandah. A billowing shrubbery fills the front (south) and side (west) garden, and on the side gate an old steel helmet hung (in 1979 under Heysen's occupation). The rear (north) verandah is on a similar level to the lawn. Here Nora Heysen loved to work, sit, smoke, drink coffee, feed magpies and sometimes entertain friends. Here she would stand her easel, often painting flowers from the garden, especially roses - old fashioned snowy \\"Frau Karl Druschki\\" and delicate pink \\"Souvenir de Malmaison\\" ('Father's favourite' (Hans Heysen). Cottage bunches of flowers composed of whatever was in season were common painting subjects. Jonquils, snowdrops, grape hyacinths, scillas (bluebells), daffodils, lachenalias, polyanthus, primulas, iris and love-in-a-mist (Nigella damascena) in spring. In summer: zinnias, daisies, dahlias, fuchsias, salvias, freesias, columbines (Aquilegia), delphiniums, poppies and more unusual flowers. Many cottage garden flowers (shrubs, bulbs, perennials) reflect Nora Heysen's period of occupation and interests, being often depicted in her paintings of flowers from the garden, especially roses. Cottage bunches of flowers composed of whatever was in season were common subjects. Nora grew many flowers herself on the sunny side of the house, always planting a special bed of anemones, which she loved to paint because they were her mother (Selma Heysen, known as Sally)'s favourite. In the hall she always kept a \\"Souvenir de Malmaison\\" rose under her pencil portrait of Hans Heysen, and in her light-filled bedroom hung another of his favourites - her painting of spring flowers. Lilac (Syringa vulgaris cv.s) was another of Hans Heysen's favourites. The back garden was overhung with a magnificent mature Moreton Bay fig (Ficus macrophylla) in the north-western corner,Stuart Read, pers.comm., 16 September 2009. an enormous jacaranda (J.mimosifolia) glorious in spring with mauve flowers. Its canopy, loved by birds, provided ideal conditions beneath for masses of busy- lizzies/water fuchsias (Impatiens sp.) in glowing scarlet, crimson, coral and pink and the garden often fluttered with butterflies. The garden complements the house and contains a wide variety of interesting plants. An unusually large indigenous cheese tree (Glochidion ferdinandii) stands to the south-west of and close to the house. Many roses that appear to be from the Federation period may be significant in their own right. Other plantings that give character to the house include mid twentieth-century camellias, numerous bulbs (snowdrops, jonquils (Narcissus x 'Earlicheer'), belladonna lilies (Amaryllis x belladonna)), Citrus trees, screens of bamboo (particularly to the west), and subtropical / temperate perennials (Arum lilies (Zantedeschia aethiopica), ginger (Hedychium/Alpinia spp.), Kaffir lilies (Clivia miniata), prayer plants (Maranta sp.)). The garden in 2006 was very overgrown.Vale, Brad. August 2006. Under the Moreton Bay fig tree in the north-western corner, a smaller Illawarra flame tree (Brachychion acerifolium), jacaranda and a firewheel tree (Stenocarpus sinuatus) try to compete with the fig, unsuccessfully. =House= Fretwork valance The Chalet is a prefabricated single storey residence with Baltic timber walls, sandstone rubble foundations and a hipped slate roof. Its wide front verandah runs across the front (south) with a decorative fascia and a valence of fretwork behind, commanding a harbour view of the Parramatta River. The balustrade is also of timber, again with fretwork. A paved verandah where Nora Heysen often worked occurs to the rear (north) of the house, which is on a similar level to the lawn. A series of French doors open out onto the front (south) verandah and a lobby opens onto the rear veranda. The rear outbuildings have been demolished and a kitchen, dining room and living room added to the east. Externally the detail of the veranda has been continued. The front stair is to the eastern end of the building, in contrast to the now demolished Croissy where it was central. AlthoughThe Chalet appears similar in form to colonial Georgian buildings, it was not necessarily specifically designed for Australian conditions and may have been a picturesque \\"Swiss Cottage\\" or \\"Bavarian Cottage\\" popular in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century. The London Suburb of Swiss Cottage records such decorative buildings. The entrance hall is at one end of the building, a feature not usually found in colonial Georgian bungalows. Mid nineteenth century American pattern books contain examples of carpenter gothic buildings with double valences and verandas, frequently to more than one elevation. The Chalet is less substantial than a traditional Swiss Chalet, which was usually raised up above the ground to allow for storage areas on the lower level. The timber components were reputedly numbered with \\"code markings like roman numerals\\" as was common practice. Dowel fixings were used. The extent to which evidence of this construction has survived has not been determined. Photographs of the exterior of the building show that the prefabrication is evident in the sidewalls. The veranda appears to have its own structure, with cross bracing to the supporting posts and into the front walls of the house, an unusual detail for Australia. The outer layer of fretwork to the veranda conceals the ends of the rafters, a practical detail that protects them from water entry. The cosy dining room with its corner fireplace was (in the Heysen period) overlaid with a patina of form and patterns - New Guinea carvings, including the beautiful bowl painted in \\"The Flower Ship\\" (1945); fruit, quinces, pomegranates, persimmons, pears enjoyed as much for shape, colour and texture as taste; \\"Art in Australia\\" magazines; paintings by fellow artists and, in the centre of the round cedar table, always a low bowl of mixed flowers - whatever took Nora's fancy each morning. Tropical shells adorned the spacious old sunlit bathroom with its black and white tiled floor. Paintings were stacked in the front hall and around the walls of Heysen's studio. A sandstone outbuilding is situated in the gardens with timber joinery and a hipped corrugated iron roof. = Condition = As at 20 October 2004, the place has been in known European occupation since 1855, and may yield cultural deposits, including the footings of outbuildings, from the earlier period of settlement on the Hunters Hill peninsula. The garden in 2006 was very overgrown. Apart from an extension in masonry of apparent late 19th century construction to the east, and some minor internal alterations, The Chalet is intact, and exhibits a remarkable degree of integrity. = Modifications and dates = 19th century masonry-walled extensions to the eastern portion. The rear outbuildings have been demolished and a kitchen, dining room and living room added to the east. Externally the detail of the veranda has been continued. = Further information = Interior not inspected, although the interior is illustrated in \\"Fine Houses of Sydney\\" by Irving et.al.  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries As at 2 January 2013, The Chalet was a very rare and distinctive example of an early prefabricated timber Swiss cottage in Australia. Dating from 1855, the house was imported from Hamburg, Germany, by Swiss emigre, Leonardo Etienne Bordier, and erected by indentured German tradesmen at sab Hill, an early French settlement of Sydney. The house remains the only surviving cottage of four prefabricated cottages originally erected as part of Bordier's planned speculative development at Hunters Hill. Aesthetically, The Chalet is distinctive and rare in Australia as a fine, highly crafted example of a picturesque and authentic Swiss or possibly Bavarian timber cottage from the Victorian period, imported from Germany, and erected by indentured specialist German tradesmen for a Swiss emigre. The Swiss cottage is complete with its original collection of fine, decorative details, such as moulded timber joinery and doors, door hardware, fixtures and fittings, all of a distinctive French style which is very rare for Australia. The prefabricated house design may have been a prototype for the 1855 Paris Industrial Exhibition erected in Hamburg where Bordier purchased the house in 1854. Historically, The Chalet represents a remarkable aspect of Australia's early history of immigration and settlement by European immigrants during the 19th Century, associated with the 1850s gold rush. It demonstrates the early use of imported prefabricated buildings to address the housing shortage due to the 1850s gold rush, and provides remnant evidence of the first planned group of houses at Hunters Hill. The subdivision, house and gardens also provide evidence of one of the first examples of Garden Suburb development in Australia's oldest Garden Suburb, Hunters Hill, which predated the Garden Suburb movement. Technically, The Chalet represents a rare surviving example of timber prefabrication from Hamburg, as the majority of prefabricated building components used in Australia during the gold rush period were ordered from Great Britain. The only other known timber example from Hamburg is located in Geelong, Victoria. The property is also significant for its association with artist Nora Heysen, who lived and worked at The Chalet from 1954 until her death in 2003. Nora Heysen (1911-2003) is recognised as one of Australia's foremost female painters and was the first woman war artist in World War II and the first female recipient of the coveted Archibald Prize in 1938 at age 27.HO, 2004. The garden complements the house and contains a wide variety of interesting plants. An unusually large indigenous cheese tree (Glochidion ferdinandii) stands to the west of the house. Many roses that appear to be from the Federation period may be significant in their own right. Many cottage garden flowers (shrubs, bulbs, perennials) reflect Nora Heysen's period of occupation and interests, being often depicted in her paintings of flowers from the garden, especially roses. Cottage bunches of flowers composed of whatever was in season were common subjects.modified Stuart Read, December 2006. The Chalet was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 June 2005 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Chalet represents a very rare and early surviving Australian example of a prefabricated timber cottage imported from Hamburg, Germany by ship. It is the only surviving cottage from a group of four identical prefabricated cottages purchased in 1854 by Swiss emigre Leonardo Etienne Bordier and erected by specially engaged Germany tradesmen at the early French settlement of Sydney at Hunters Hill on two of the earliest land grants of the suburb. The subdivision, house and gardens provide remnant evidence of the first planned group of houses in Hunters Hill, as a speculative development of the Garden Suburb philosophy, which was to characterise the development of Hunters Hill. They also demonstrate one of the first examples of Garden Suburb development in Australia's oldest Garden Suburb, Hunters Hill, which predated the Garden Suburb movement. The house further illustrates the early use of imported prefabricated buildings to address the housing shortage due to the 1850s gold rush. Overall, this 19th Century speculative development in an early French settlement of Sydney, and its planning, design, origins, construction and associations, all represent a remarkable aspect of Australia's early history of immigration and settlement by European immigrants during the 19th Century, associated with the 1850s gold rush. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The development was carried out by Etienne Bordier a Swiss immigrant who was one of a number of French/ French Swiss founders of Hunters Hill. The property is also has associated with Didier Numa Joubert, and Charles Edward Jeanneret, also prominent early citizens of Hunters Hill and mayors of the Council which is one of the few early (1861) councils that maintains its original boundaries. The Chalet is associated with prominent Australian artist, Nora Heysen (1911-2003), the first female recipient of the Archibald prize, who lived and worked at The Chalet from 1954 until her death in 2003. Nora Heysen served as a war artist in WWII and is recognised as one of Australia's foremost female painters. She has been awarded both the Order of Australia and the Australia Council's Award for Achievement in the Arts. Nora Heysen and her husband may have selected the house for its Germanic detailing. From an interview in 1965 Nora Heysen said \\"Now I think I've found my own environment. The house itself is about 120 years old, in a very wandering wilderness of a garden where I can grow my own flowers for painting, and the atmosphere is peaceful and very conducive to my work.\\" The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Chalet is distinctive and rare in Australia as a fine, highly crafted example of a picturesque and authentic Swiss or possibly Bavarian timber cottage from the Victorian period, dating from 1855, imported from Germany, erected by indentured specialist German tradesmen for a Swiss émigré. The Swiss cottage is complete with its original collection of fine, decorative details, such as moulded timber joinery and doors, door hardware, fixtures and fittings, all of a distinctive French style which is very rare for Australia. The prefabricated house design may have been a prototype for the 1855 Paris Industrial Exhibition erected in Hamburg where Bordier purchased the house in 1854. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Chalet is well known and important to the community's sense of place as a landmark of Hunters Hill, which embodies many of its distinctive characteristics and represents the early history of the area, its origins as a Garden Suburb and as an early French settlement of Sydney. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Chalet has research potential for improving an understanding of the types of imported \\"knock-down\\" prefabricated cottages imported into Australia during the 1850s gold rush era, and on the construction techniques and craftsmanship of indentured German carpenters in Australia during this period. The Chalet has potential to yield information on 19th century timber prefabrication from Hamburg, constructed of Baltic Pine with dowelled timber joining details and elements marked in Roman numerals, which is very rare in Australia as the majority of prefabricated building components used in Australia during the gold rush period were ordered from Great Britain. The only other known timber example from Hamburg is situated in Geelong, Victoria. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Prefabricated timber cottages sourced from the Germany are very rare in Australia. The Chalet is one of only two 1850s buildings of this type known to be extant in Australia, which can provide evidence of the housing development in response to the influx of immigrants for the 1850s gold rush. The Chalet is the only surviving cottage of the group of four identical prefabricated cottages constructed at Hunters Hill. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. This speculative development in an early French settlement of Sydney, in the planning, design, origins, construction and associations of the house and gardens, represents a remarkable aspect of Australia's early history of immigration and settlement by European immigrants during the 19th Century, associated with the 1850s gold rush. The Chalet represents a fine, highly crafted example of a Swiss prefabricated timber cottage from the Victorian period, imported from Hamburg Germany and erected by indentured specialist German tradesmen for a Swiss emigre. The subdivision, house and gardens also represent one of the first examples of Garden Suburb development in Australia's oldest Garden Suburb, Hunters Hill, which predated the Garden Suburb movement.

In parliament, Becerra served as vice-chair of the European Parliament Subcommittee on Human Rights and is a member of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe group (ALDE). From 2009 to 2014 Becerra was on the Board of Directors of Union, Progress and Democracy (UPyD) as its Communication Manager. She was elected a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) in 2014 after joining the UPyD list. Biography Beatriz Becerra graduated in Industrial Psychology from the Complutense University of Madrid in 1989. She has also completed a Master's in Business Administration and Management. From 1989 to 2005 she worked in the audiovisual sector at multinationals such as CBS (where she got her first job) and Buena Vista International Spain (owned by The Walt Disney Company). From 1998 to 2005 she worked at Sony Pictures Entertainment, where she became Director of Marketing and Sales for Spain and Portugal. She also worked for the NGO Action Against Hunger and as a consultant for Discovery Networks. In addition, she developed a teaching career in postgraduate studies between 1998 and 2014 at the Villanueva University Center and Comillas Pontifical University. As a writer, she has published three novels: Las criadas de Caifás, La reina del Plata, and La estirpe de los niños infelices. Without prior political affiliation, in 2008 Becerra joined Union, Progress and Democracy, a Spanish political party founded in 2007 and whose leader was then Rosa Díez. At the UPyD Congress held in 2009 she was elected to the main executive body, the Board of Directors, to be part of the candidacy headed by Díez. For the next four and a half years she was responsible for the party's communications. Becerra stood for the European Parliament elections of 25 May 2014 on the UPyD list. She was elected when her party received 6.5% of the votes and four seats. UPyD joined the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe group, chaired by Belgian Guy Verhofstadt. During the months following the elections, UPyD suffered a series of internal and electoral crises that ended with the withdrawal of Rosa Díez and her party from the Congress of Deputies and leaving it with hardly any relevant public offices. On 1 April 2016, Becerra announced, along with other UPyD members and officeholders, that she was leaving the party because \\"it had ceased to be useful to society.\\" She continues as an independent MEP within ALDE. Activity in the European Parliament After becoming a Member of the European Parliament, Beatriz Becerra joined the Committees on Employment and Social Affairs, Women's Rights and Gender Equality, and Petitions. In November 2014 she left the first of these and joined the Development Committee and the Human Rights subcommittee, of which she is vice-chair. In addition, she is part of the delegations of the European Parliament in the Euro-Latin American Parliamentary Assembly and the EU-Mexico Joint Parliamentary Committee. She is also a substitute in the Delegation for Relations with Japan. Her parliamentary activity has focused, among other issues, on the defense of human rights, gender equality, economic and social development, access to medicines, and support for entrepreneurs and startups. In 2016, she presented the candidacy of Yazidi activist Nadia Murad Basee to ALDE for the Sakharov Prize for freedom of conscience. ALDE supported this candidacy, and on 27 October of the same year it was announced that the European Parliament awarded the Sakharov Prize to Murad and Lamiya Aji Bashar, also a Yazidi activist. In September 2016, Becerra presented the Alliance of Women Against Radicalization and Extremism (AWARE) platform, a network oriented to the study and prevention of radicalization from a gender perspective, and which defends the creation of a common European policy on respect. The platform has the support of women such as Nadia Murad and Miriam González Durántez. She has been a speaker in the European Parliament's report on mental health and gender equality, which raised the need to incorporate a gender perspective in research and treatment of diseases. In international politics, she has stood out for her support to the Venezuelan opposition in its confrontation with the government of Nicolás Maduro, leading ALDE's negotiation on a resolution of the European Parliament that demanded, among other measures, the release of political prisoners. In 2017, after several months of protests in Venezuela, Becerra promoted the candidacy of the Venezuelan political opposition for the Sakharov Prize. Becerra has been singled out and intimidated by members of the Venezuelan government for her persistent defense of the freedom of Venezuelans. In June 2018, she vsisted Cúcuta, a border city between Colombia and Venezuela, as part of a parliamentary mission to observe the situation of Venezuelan refugees arriving there. She joined the task force of MEPs on Brexit, with a special focus on guaranteeing the rights of Europeans residing in the United Kingdom, and of British residents of the EU after the referendum that approved the abandonment of the European institutions. On 7 July 2017, in response to a letter from the MEP, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker confirmed that, if the secession of Catalonia were to take place, the new state would automatically be excluded from the European Union. In September, the President of the European Parliament, Antonio Tajani, also replied to Becerra stating that, \\"any action against the Constitution of a Member State is an action against the legal framework of the European Union.\\" In July 2018, Becerra announced the publication of her book Eres liberal y no lo sabes (You are Liberal and You Don't Know It), scheduled for September of that year, which she described as \\"a manifesto for an inclusive liberalism, free of dogmatism and modernity.\\" References External links * Category:1966 births Category:Living people Category:20th-century Spanish businesspeople Category:20th-century Spanish educators Category:21st-century Spanish businesspeople Category:21st-century Spanish educators Category:21st-century Spanish women writers Category:Spanish women educators Category:Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe MEPs Category:Businesspeople from Madrid Category:Complutense University of Madrid alumni Category:Independent politicians in Spain Category:MEPs for Spain 2014–2019 Category:21st-century women MEPs for Spain Category:Politicians from Madrid Category:Spanish women in business Category:Union, Progress and Democracy MEPs Category:Writers from Madrid Category:20th-century businesswomen Category:21st-century businesswomen Category:20th-century women educators Category:21st-century women educators ","title":"Beatriz Becerra"},{"id":"58013854","text":"The Church of the Holy Trinity, Bishop's Road, Paddington.

It was built during 1872 by Richard Sim. It is also known as Atherslei. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The site of Milthorpe was originally granted to a Mr Morgan and bought by Foss as part of his estate in 1862. Lots 6-10 were purchased in one parcel running in a rectangular block from the Lane Cove River to Passy Avenue from Alexandra Street and a line drawn from Abrose Street to Rooke Street.Pike, 1992. Milthorpe was originally set in a larger estate but has been reduced by previous excisions of the property, the most major recent subdivision taking place in 1976 when a number of new lots were created in Rooke Street. At this time Milthorpe had an area of .Branch Manager, 1986, p.5. Milthorpe is thought to have been built in 1872 by Richard Sim as a fourteen-room stone house. The building was given a Federation style appearance after remodelling around 1900.Falk, Jonathon 1986, p.2. The river edge is marked by a stone retaining wall. The land behind this wall was reclaimed early in the twentieth century. Stone baths with access to the river were sited until 1924 where the central BBQ shelter now stands. A sandstone wall with columns ran from the baths across the reclaimed land. Part of this stone wall remains at the waters edge. Behind the reclaimed land the site climbed through a series of informal retaining walls to two terraces of sloping lawn.  Description  Milthorpe is sited on a terrace well back from the river in the traditional nineteenth century Hunters Hill manner. It is a substantial stone residence set within extensive landscaped grounds on the Lane Cove River. It has a slate roof and faces north-east, overlooking the sloping lawn and gardens to the flat reclaimed area and the Lane Cove River beyond. Milthorpe has appurtenant garage and workshop areas to its rear boundary. The flat, reclaimed portion of the land is further developed with a large L-shaped boat shed and cabana adjacent to the waters edge, an inground swimming pool and a synthetic surface tennis court. A gazebo is located within the landscaped area to the north of the main dwelling.O'Dowd, 1988.

Heritage listing  As at 1 October 1997, Milthorpe was a good example of the substantial villas built on large sites which were a feature of the historical development of Hunters Hill in the nineteenth century. In particular, it is one of the few large estates of this period in Hunters Hill which has retained its historic setting on the foreshores of the Lane Cove River. The house is of architectural interest because of the quality of its features and its adaption from a mid-Victorian to a Federation style.Central File, 1995. Milthorpe was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Milthorpe is one of the few remaining privately owned nineteenth century villa estates left in Sydney Harbour which has retained much of its original land and its physical links with the water. Its siting and setting demonstrates the distinctive characteristics of the nineteenth century Hunters Hill marine villa development. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Milthorpe is of aesthetic significance for the way it is sited to address the water, with a backdrop of large, dense trees and for the way it can be viewed from a public wharf, public ferry route and from the Lane Cove River. Its wide, reclaimed foreshore area properly belongs to and enhances the house and characterises the late 19th and early 20th century scale and use of foreshore villa gardens, compensating for subdivision developments which crowd its other boundaries.Hunters Hill Trust, 1986.

He was the deputy mayor of Belgrade from 2014 to 2018 and is currently one of the city's three assistant mayors. For many years a prominent member of the Democratic Party of Serbia (Demokratska stranka Srbije, DSS), he was expelled from the party in 2015 and subsequently founded his own Independent Democratic Party of Serbia (Samostalna Demokratska stranka Srbije, Samostalni DSS). He is now aligned with the Serbian Progressive Party. Early life and private career Mladenović was born in Belgrade, in what was then the Socialist Republic of Serbia in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. He has a master's degree from the Faculty of International Engineering Management at the European University in Belgrade and has enrolled in doctoral studies at the same institution.Андреја Младеновић, помоћник градоначелника, City of Belgrade, accessed 27 July 2018. Political career =Democratic Party of Serbia= Mladenović was a member of the Zemun municipal assembly and deputy mayor of the municipality from 2000 to 2004, with responsibility for sports and youth, refugees and social issues, and relations with religious communities.Андреја Младеновић, помоћник градоначелника, City of Belgrade, accessed 27 July 2018. He was subsequently elected to the Assembly of the City of Belgrade in the 2004 city election after receiving the second position on the DSS's list.Službeni list, City of Belgrade, 8 September 2004, p. 6; and Službeni list, City of Belgrade, 29 November 2004, p. 2. The DSS participated in the city's coalition government after the election, and Mladenović was appointed to city council (i.e., the executive branch of municipal government) with responsibility for sports and youth.Андреја Младеновић, помоћник градоначелника, City of Belgrade, accessed 27 July 2018. DSS spokesperson in the first Koštunica ministry Mladenović received the fifty-seventh position (out of 250) on the DSS's electoral list in the 2003 Serbian parliamentary election.Избори за народне посланике Народне скупштине одржани 28. децембра 2003. године, ИЗБОРНЕ ЛИСТЕ (ДЕМОКРАТСКА СТРАНКА СРБИЈЕ - ВОЈИСЛАВ КОШТУНИЦА) , Republika Srbija - Republička izborna komisija, accessed 28 April 2017. The list won fifty-three mandates, and he was not selected for its assembly delegation. (From 2000 to 2011, Serbian parliamentary mandates were awarded to sponsoring parties or coalitions rather than to individual candidates, and it was common practice for the mandates to be awarded out of numerical order. Mladenović could have been awarded a mandate despite his relatively low position, although in the event he was not.)Serbia's Law on the Election of Representatives (2000) stipulated that parliamentary mandates would be awarded to electoral lists (Article 80) that crossed the electoral threshold (Article 81), that mandates would be given to candidates appearing on the relevant lists (Article 83), and that the submitters of the lists were responsible for selecting their parliamentary delegations within ten days of the final results being published (Article 84). See Law on the Election of Representatives, Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia, No. 35/2000, made available via LegislationOnline, accessed 28 February 2017.

The DSS emerged from the election at the head of a coalition government, with party leader Vojislav Koštunica as prime minister. Following the 2004 Kosovo parliamentary election, which was largely boycotted by Serbs in the aftermath of anti-Serb violence earlier in the year in the disputed region, Mladenović said that Kosovo Serbs would never accept a multi- ethnic governance agreement \\"that gives them only the right to vote.\\" He added that the Serbian government would continue to negotiate its own plan for resolving the status of Kosovo and Metohija with the international community.\\"Serbia: DSS official says government to insist on Kosovo decentralization plan,\\" British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring European, 27 October 2004 (Source: Glas javnosti, Belgrade, in Serbian 26 Oct 04 p 3).

Mladenović said in January 2005 that Sreten Lukić would surrender voluntarily to the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in The Hague to face charges of war crimes. He added that the DSS supported the principle of voluntary surrender for ICTY indictees and opposed a policy of arrests.\\"Serbian general reportedly prepared to surrender to Hague tribunal,\\" British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring European, 24 January 2005 (Source: SRNA news agency, Bijeljina, in Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian 1209 gmt 24 Jan 05).Matthew Holliday, \\"Paying the Price,\\" Transitions Online, 27 January 2005. He later criticized the European Union (EU)'s pressure tactics to persuade Serbia to surrender prominent suspects such as Radovan Karadžić and Ratko Mladić (both of whose whereabouts were unknown at the time), saying, \\"What will [additional conditions on Serbia's bid for EU membership] bring if Mladić is dead? What if he has left the country?\\"\\"Serbia's prime minister criticizes EU policies toward Belgrade,\\" Associated Press Newswires, 19 June 2006.

He rejected charges that Serbia's security forces needed to be \\"purged\\" to facilitate the extradition of Mladić and others, saying that \\"a serious country would never allow anyone from outside to dictate the country's most important positions. That would mean that we are not a country, but a colony.\\"Dusan Stojanovic, \\"Serbian official: Security services must be purged to capture Mladic,\\" Agence France Presse, 19 February 2007. The National Assembly of Serbia observed a moment of silence for all victims of the 1990s Yugoslav Wars on 11 July 2005; critics noted that the ceremony did not include specific reference to the victims of the 1995 Srebrenica massacre. Mladenović stated on this occasion, \\"Serbia has an interest in exposing and condemning all war crimes in the history of the former Yugoslavia, in which the Serbian people were the biggest victims.\\"\\"Serbian parliament in minute's silence but ignores Srebrenica,\\" Agence France Presse, 11 July 2005. In August 2006, United Nations Special Envoy for Kosovo Martti Ahtisaari's was quoted as saying that Serbs were culpable as a people for crimes committed in the Kosovo War. Mladenović described this statement as \\"scandalous, shameful, and racist.\\"\\"Serbian PM's party slates UN envoy's remarks as scandalous, racist,\\" British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring Newsfile, 26 August 2006 (Source: RTS 1 TV, Belgrade, in Serbian 1400 gmt 26 Aug 06).

DSS spokesperson in the second Koštunica ministry The 2007 Serbian parliamentary election did not produce a clear winner, and an unstable coalition government was eventually formed, led by the DSS and the rival Democratic Party (Demokratska stranka, DS). Koštunica continued to serve as prime minister. Mladenović, who provided regular media updates during the negotiations for a new government,See for instance \\"Serbian president rejects 'sixth principle' of sharing power in new government,\\" British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring European, 14 March 2007 (Source: Blic, Belgrade, in Serbian 13 Mar 07); \\"Serbia's Kostunica 'acceptable' as new PM, portfolios 'questionable' - paper,\\" British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring European, 29 March 2007 (Source: Politika, Belgrade, in Serbian 29 Mar 07 pp 1, 7); \\"Serbian PM's party denies secret talks on government formation,\\" British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring European, 20 April 2007 (Source: FoNet news agency, Belgrade, in Serbian 1535 gmt 20 Apr 07). remained the DSS's media spokesperson, although from July 2007 he shared this responsibility with Branislav Ristivojević.\\"Kosovo is issue of Albanian minority in Serbia - PM's party spokesman,\\" British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring European, 9 July 2007 (Source: FoNet news agency, Belgrade, in Serbian 1318 gmt 9 Jul 07).

In November 2007, he said that a new European Union (EU) mission to Kosovo and Metohija would be unacceptable for Serbia prior to the resolution of the disputed area's status.\\"Serbian PM's party rejects EU mission prior to Kosovo status resolution,\\" British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring European, 13 November 2007 (Source: Radio B92 text website, Belgrade, in English 1530 gmt 12 Nov 07). The DSS offered to support DS incumbent Boris Tadić in the second round of the 2008 Serbian presidential election if Tadić agreed to abandon Serbia's Stabilization and Association Agreement with the European Union in the event of the EU sending a new mission to Kosovo. Tadić rejected the offer, and the DSS remained neutral in the runoff vote. Mladenović stated that Tadić and the DS were to blame for this outcome, arguing that the DSS proposal was a legitimate offer and not a form of blackmail.\\"Serbian PM's party blames Democrats for rejecting deal ahead of election,\\" British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring European, 24 January 2008 (Source: Radio B92, Belgrade, in Serbian 1400 gmt 24 Jan 08). Tadić won a narrow victory in the election despite the absence of a DSS endorsement. Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence in 2008 and its subsequent recognition by EU countries created a crisis for the DSS–DS government. Mladenović expressed the DSS's view that Serbia should hold a referendum on whether the country should continue its efforts to join the EU \\"with or without Kosovo.\\" He added that \\"official policy thus far has been that Kosovo is Serbia and that we will join the EU with Kosovo as a constituent part.\\"\\"Serbian premier's party calls for EU referendum,\\" British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring European, 5 March 2008 (Source: Radio B92 text website, Belgrade, in English 1228 gmt 5 Mar 08). The crisis ultimately led to the breakdown of the coalition government and to early elections in 2008. The DSS contested the election on a joint list with New Serbia, and Mladenović received the sixty-second position on their combined list.Избори за народне посланике Народне скупштине одржани 11. маја 2008. године, ИЗБОРНЕ ЛИСТЕ (Демократска Странка Србије - Нова Србија - Војислав Коштуница) , Republika Srbija - Republička izborna komisija, accessed 26 April 2017. Boris Tadić announced during the campaign that he would sign the Stabilization and Association Agreement with the EU; Mladenović responded by saying, \\"his signature is not the signature of Serbia. He is in fact putting a seal of Judas of his party coalition to the [agreement].\\"\\"Serbian PM's party rejects 'seal of Judas' Tadic on SAA,\\" British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring European, 29 April 2008 (Source: Radio B92 text website, Belgrade, in English 1326 gmt 29 Apr 08). The 2008 election again failed to produce a clear winner. The DSS–NS alliance won thirty seats, and Mladenović indicated that it would not negotiate with any pro-EU parties for a new coalition government.\\"Serbian PM's party excludes possibility of coalition with pro-European forces,\\" British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring European, 12 May 2008 (Source: RTS1 TV, Belgrade, in Serbian 2200gmt 12 May 08). The DSS came close to forming a new government with the far-right Serbian Radical Party and the Socialist Party of Serbia, during which time Mladenović again provided regular updates on the status of negotiations.See for instance \\"Nationalist Premier of Serbia Teams Up With Radical Party,\\" New York Times, 14 May 2008, p. 8; \\"Serbia: Kostunica's party lists five goals of proposed new 'national' government,\\" British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring European, 15 May 2008 (Source: FoNet news agency, Belgrade, in Serbian 1849gmt 15 May 08). The talks between the parties ultimately failed, and the Socialists instead formed a coalition government with the For a European Serbia alliance led by the DS. The DSS moved into opposition, and Mladenović did not participate in the party's assembly delegation. At the municipal level, Mladenović was re-elected to the city assembly in the 2008 Belgrade election after being included on a combined DSS–NS list, which won twelve mandates (out of 110).Službeni list, City of Belgrade, 30 April 2008, p. 3.Službeni list, City of Belgrade, 15 June 2008, p. 2. Mirroring developments at the republic level, the DSS held talks with the Radicals and Socialists for a new municipal government, and Mladenović indicated that the DSS would be ready to support Radical Aleksandar Vučić as mayor.\\"Serbian Radicals, Socialists, PM's party expect to form Belgrade city government,\\" British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring European, 16 May 2008 (Source: RTS 1 TV, Belgrade, in Serbian 1730 gmt 15 May 08).

He appears to have stood down as DSS media spokesperson in early 2010. Later years (2010–15) Serbia's electoral system was reformed in 2011, such that parliamentary mandates were awarded in numerical order to candidates on successful lists. Mladenović received the forty-fourth position on the DSS's electoral list in the 2012 Serbian parliamentary election.Избори за народне посланике Народне скупштине, 6. мај 2012. године, ИЗБОРНЕ ЛИСТЕ (ДЕМОКРАТСКА СТРАНКА СРБИЈЕ - ВОЈИСЛАВ КОШТУНИЦА) , Republika Srbija - Republička izborna komisija, accessed 28 April 2017.

She has represented India internationally and plays the position of a defender. She has played 11 international matches as of July 2018.  Early life  Suman Devi Thoudam hails from Singjamei Monkhanglambi in Imphal, from the state of Manipur. Born in 1998, she is the oldest daughter of Thoudam Anand. She started her hockey career at a young age, participating in inter-school tournaments in Delhi and in Amritsar in 2011, as well as larger state tournaments like the Sub Junior National in Patna in 2011 and Jawaharlal Nehru Tournaments in 2013 (runners up) and in 2012 (runners up). She continued to represent her state for the next few years in junior tournaments, and participated in Sub Junior National in Pune 2014 (winner), Sub Junior National Bhopal 2013 (runners up), Junior National 2014 in Mysore (runners up), Junior National 2013 in Ranchi (runners up) and Sub Junior Zonal in Mumbai.  Career  From national tournaments, Suman moved on to representing her country internationally. She was a part of the Indian youth hockey team which won the World Youth Hockey Tournament (under-18) held in Netherlands on 11 and 12 August 2014, for which she was felicitated by her old training institute, the South East Youth Organisation. She also participated in the Asia Cup 2017, where her contribution led to India building a strong defence and conceding only 5 goals in the 6-match tournament, and eventually going on to win the tournament as continental champions and earning them a qualifying spot at the Hockey World Cup. In the run-up to the Hockey World Cup 2018 in London, the Indian women's hockey team participated in the Spain Tour where they played five matches against the Spanish National team starting 12 June 2018. Suman was a part of the 20-member squad of the Spain Tour, which defeated the host Spanish team 4-1 in the 5-match series. However, she was not chosen to be a part of the final World Cup squad. Suman was also a part of the Indian junior women's hockey team, and participated in the Under-23 Six Nations Tournament held between 14–21 July 2018 in Antwerp, Belgium.

Lăzăreanu-Lăzurică or George Lăzurică, also known as Lăzărescu- Lăzurică or Lăzărică (1892 – ?), was a leader of the Romani (Gypsy) community in Romania, also remembered for his support of Romania's interwar far-right. Originally a musician, he became active within the General Association of Gypsies in Romania, but broke away to establish the (eventually more powerful) General Union of Roma in Romania. From September 1933 to May 1934, he was also a \\"Voivode of the Gypsies\\", recognized as such by various local tribes. He and his followers came to resent ethnic designation as \\"Gypsies\\", and pleaded for the usage of \\"Romanies\\". Lăzurică also tried to introduce the term Zgripți as a reference to the people's legendary ancestors. Though credited with inventing Romani political symbolism and noted for invoking a worldwide tribal identity, Lăzurică and his followers abstained from Romani nationalist activism, preferring to focus on social reform, and accepted some measure of integration with mainstream Romanian society. The General Union cooperated with the Romanian Orthodox Church, spreading Christianity among nomads whom it helped to settle, and competing for baptisms with the Romanian Greek Catholics. From 1933, Lăzurică blended his Romani identity with Romanian nationalism, and finally with fascism: he campaigned for the National Agrarian Party and maintained contacts with the Iron Guard, while allegedly imitating Adolf Hitler in his public persona. Lăzurică was sidelined by the General Union in 1934, after a violent conflict during which he was forced to deny his belonging to the Romani ethnicity. He soon recanted and involved himself in other projects, with reports suggesting that he was planning a research trip to the British Raj, or that he declared himself \\"President\\" of the Romanian Romanies. He still attempted to rally support for his politics, and in 1937 became leader of the Citizens' Association of Roma in Romania. This group was more explicitly far-right and antisemitic, viewing the Romanians and Romanies as people of a \\"shared destiny\\", equally threatened by foreigners. By 1938, it was openly supporting the fascist National Christian Party, of which Lăzurică himself became a member. In the final known stages of his career, Lăzurică became a critic of Orthodoxy, reporting on its slave-owning practices and drawing suspicion that he had converted to Catholicism. Activities =Rise to fame= Reportedly born as Gheorghe Lăzărescu in 1892,Williams, p. 23 the future activist belonged to the musicians' tribe of the Romani community, or Lăutari; one report of 1934 suggests that he was still an outstanding performer.Michel Condrus, \\"Une mission va rechercher aux Indes les orgines de la race tzigane\\", in Le Journal, August 27, 1934, p. 4 While sometimes introduced as \\"Mr. Lăzurică the lawyer\\",\\"Știri mărunte. Locale\\", in Unirea. Foaie Bisericească-Politică, Issue 29/1934, p. 4 he had in fact graduated from the Commercial School of Bucharest, and, by 1933, was running his own forestry warehouse in that same city. \\"27 august – Ziua Mișcării Romilor din România. Ziua Activistului Rom\\", in Pata-Cluj. Buletin Informativ, July 18, 2016 Lăzurică's main activity was as a journalist, published by both Universul and Adevărul,Williams, p. 23. See also Matei (2012), p. 57 though he also contributed poetry.\\"Cigansko Ljudstvo je iz dobe faraonov\\", in Glas Naroda, Issue 158/1936, p. 3 Lăzurică wrote in Romanian, but expressed his pride at having Romani heritage, and some time after 1930 changed his name to the hyphenated form, with Lăzurică sounding more like his Romani vernacular. Lăzurică's life and career coincided with the earliest attempts to create a Romani political caucus. Some of the first steps in this direction occurred in 1919 Transylvania, which was in the process of uniting with Romania. \\"Gypsy gatherings\\", which demanded increased rights and sedentarization of the Romanies within Greater Romania, were nevertheless forgotten by the public, as even some of the active participants refrained from discussing them later in the interwar.Petre Matei, \\"Adunările țiganilor din Transilvania din anul 1919\\", in Revista Istorică, Part I: Vol. XXI, Issues 5–6, 2010, pp. 467–487; Part II: Vol. XXII, Issues 1–2, 2011, pp. 135–152. See also Matei (2012), pp. 30–31, 56 A first documented effort of organizing the Romanies into a political body occurred in 1926, with Lazăr Naftanailă's Neo-Rustic Brotherhood, centered on Calbor.Achim (2004), p. 154; Dieaconu & Costachie, p. 184; Klímová-Alexander, pp. 168–169, 201; Matei (2012), pp. 31, 56–57, 66; Williams, p. 23 Naftanailă was among the first activists to advocate the creation of another ethnonym to replace țigani (\\"Gypsies\\", from Athinganoi), and tried to impose \\"Neo-Rustics\\", or \\"new peasants\\", as a non-discriminatory alternative.Matei (2012), pp. 56–57 The following year, a Lăutari syndicate, Junimea Muzicală, applied for registration in Ilfov County. This became the nucleus for the much larger General Association of Gypsies in Romania (AGȚR), unofficially formed by Calinic Șerboianu in April 1933.Matei (2012), p. 57 Lăzurică and Gheorghe Nicolescu (or Niculescu) are recorded as AGȚR militants, and soon after as factional leaders; the schism between them and Șerboianu is most precisely dated to September of the same year.Klímová-Alexander, pp. 169, 201 As reported by ethnologist Gabriela Boangiu, this was the peak of a feud between Șerboianu and one of the AGȚR's \\"main leaders\\", Lăzurică.Boangiu, pp. 712–713 Șerboianu continued to preside over one of these organizations, which still used the AGȚR title. Most of its membership was absorbed by Lăzurică's more competitive General Union of Roma in Romania (UGRR).Klímová-Alexander, p. 204 As seen by Boangiu, Lăzurică was \\"as quaint a figure as he was important for the associationist phenomenon of the Rroma ethnicity.\\"Boangiu, pp. 712 Also known as the General Union of the Romanian Gypsies,Mudure, pp. 64–65 Lăzurică's group held congress on October 8 at Ileana Hall, in the Bucharest neighborhood of Moșilor.\\"Și țiganii își au asociația lor. —În loc de una însă au două, dar nu se pot înțelege împreună\\", in Unirea Poporului, Issue 40/1933, p. 7 In November, Lăzurică applied for the UGRR to be recognized as a juridical person under Romanian law, but this process stagnated upon revelations that six of its founding members were either registered with fictitious addresses or had criminal records. Researcher Ilona Klímová- Alexander writes that Lăzurică managed to \\"hijack\\" Șerboianu's plans, \\"traveling all over the country, establishing local branches and emphasizing their relationship to the centre; he also visited universities and persuaded Romani students to attend.\\"Klímová-Alexander, p. 169 Claiming to be the first- ever assembly of the Romanies in Romania, this caucus proclaimed Lăzurică its \\"Voivode\\";Achim (2004), p. 155; Klímová-Alexander, p. 169; Mudure, pp. 64–65 Șerboianu was marginalized, and his supporters, mostly based in Transylvania, were barred from attending the UGRR meeting. =Congress= Romani flag, reportedly used by the UGRR In July 1934, the UGRR entered Șerboianu's fief in Târnava-Mică County, opening its own chapter with a festivity on Liberty field.\\"Romii la Blaj\\", in Unirea Poporului, Issue 29/1934, p. 4 In October, the Union organized an international congress of the Gypsies.\\"Unique Congress of Gypsies Urges All Nomads to Unite\\", in The Laredo Times, November 19, 1933, p. 2Alex F. Mihail, \\"Poporul enigmatic. Cine sunt țiganii, de unde vin și ce obiceiuri au?\\", in Realitatea Ilustrată, Vol. VII, Issue 351, October 1933, p. 352Klímová-Alexander, pp. 172–173, 203–204; Mudure, p. 65 Held out in the open in one of Bucharest's Romani suburbs, it reportedly used the slogan \\"Gypsies of the World unite\\", calling on all nomads to \\"organize themselves into a race-conscious and stable community.\\" Its organizers promised that the Romani community had entered the age of \\"national dignity\\". Lăzurică was then tasked with representing the General Union at any future international meeting.Klímová-Alexander, p. 173 Both he and Șerboianu were members of the Gypsy Lore Society.Klímová-Alexander, pp. 203–204; Williams, pp. 23, 25–26 Historian Viorel Achim highlights Lăzurică's debts to \\"romantic literature\\", reflected in his use of \\"Voivode\\". This title had never been claimed by any Romani tribal leader in Romania, where preference had been given to lesser ones, including Bulibașa and Vătaf.Achim (2004), pp. 157–158 The same is argued by researchers Daniel Dieaconu and Silviu Costachie, who see Lăzurică as having embraced a \\"romantic myth\\" of purely Western European extraction.Dieaconu & Costachie, p. 184 Scholar Mihaela Mudure also notes that the usage of \\"Voivode\\" was meant to evoke a \\"romanticized version of Gypsy leadership\\" and command \\"feudal\\" loyalty from UGRR members; \\"democratic practices\\", she argues, \\"were very limited.\\"Mudure, p. 65 While the 28-member executive committee worked pro-bono, Lăzurică, as the UGRR acting president, received unconditional refunding for all his expenses. Lăzurică surrounded himself with distinguished members of the community: violinist Grigoraș Dinicu assisted him as honorary chairman, though he had initially resisted his own appointment; historian George Potra and musician D. Panaitescu were members of the UGRR committee. Lăzurică extended an offer to the incumbent Bulibașa, who was living \\"somewhere in Bessarabia\\", and could not be found in time for the selection. The Voivode also increased grassroots representation, being the first Romani leader to encourage the participation of women, who formed their own corps within the UGRR.Klímová-Alexander, pp. 170, 202 Lăzurică claimed to be leader over 1 million Romanies, which was probably double the number of Romanies existing in Greater Romania.Dieaconu & Costachie, p. 181. See also Duminică, p. 95 The Voivode's legitimacy was still challenged by the other Romani groups resulting from the AGȚR schism—although, according to Mudure: \\"the agenda of these organizations was pretty much the same. They were interested in creating educational opportunities for the Gypsies, welfare benefits, settling down the nomadic Gypsies, and improving the image of the Gypsies in the media.\\" The two bodies had virtually identical agendas, though with some major differences of political vocabulary.Klímová-Alexander, p. 171; Matei (2012), p. 59; Williams, p. 23 In Oltenia, a third group, headed by Aurel Manolescu-Dolj, collaborated with both national organizations in pursuing immediate objectives.Achim (2004), pp. 156–157; Klímová-Alexander, p. 174; Matei (2012), pp. 65–67; Mudure, p. 65 Manolescu-Dolj, who also styled himself \\"Voivode\\", rallied with the UGRR; his associate, Constantin S. Nicolăescu-Plopșor, published a corpus of Romani mythology for the Union's newspaper, O Ròm.Achim (2004), pp. 156–157; Boangiu, pp. 713–715; Dieaconu & Costachie, pp. 185; Klímová-Alexander, p. 174; Matei (2012), p. 67 One of the key goals of the UGRR was in convincing members and outsiders to use romi (\\"Romanies\\") over țigani, which it viewed as derogatory.Dieaconu & Costachie, p. 184; Klímová-Alexander, pp. 170, 202; Matei (2012), pp. 57–67; Williams, p. 23 Lăzurică himself extended the neologism to mean \\"freedom-loving man\\", rather than simply \\"man\\", and claimed that it had etymological links to Ramayana.Matei (2012), pp. 60–61, 64–65. See also Dieaconu & Costachie, p. 184; Duminică, p. 95 As argued by historian Petre Matei, he had had no objection to using țigani as an endonym during his association with Șerboianu, and had left several written statements describing himself as a \\"Gypsy\\".Matei (2012), pp. 57–60 Matei notes that the term was most likely suggested to him by Nicolae Constantin Batzaria, the Romanian head editor at Adevărul. In his column of September 5, 1933, Batzaria had chided Șerboianu for using an implicitly demeaning and hostile term, arguing for romi as both authentic and preferable.Matei (2012), pp. 59–60, 62 Lăzurică's first documented use of romi is dated by Matei to October 1933, in a manifesto which repeats Batzaria's attack on Șerboianu.Matei (2012), p. 60 His newfound appreciation for the term was challenged by the more senior activist Naftanailă, who, by 1934, had reconciled with the word țigani and was using it in the title of his rival newspaper, Neamul Țigănesc.Matei (2012), pp. 56–57, 62, 65–66 Generally, Lăzurică and his followers were primarily interested in cultural, spiritual, and especially social goals, which took precedence over shows of Romani nationalism; historians describe the view the UGRR as mixing social integrationism and cultural separatism.Achim (2004), pp. 156–157; Klímová- Alexander, pp. 171, 176–177; Williams, pp. 23–26 He took distance from Romani internationalism, asking Romanian authorities to ban \\"foreign\\" Romani orchestras from performing in the country, hoping to have the trade monopolized by Lăutari.Dieaconu & Costachie, p. 182 The UGRR banner displayed the symbols of Romani trades, which Lăzurică wanted protected and promoted, alongside the coat of arms of Romania; at least 36 other banners existed, each representing an UGRR affiliate group. Proposals were accepted which were to create a national flag of the Romanies. Historian Ian Hancock claims that it was a horizontal bicolor, and as such a predecessor for the current Romani flag. However, this interpretation remains disputed.Klímová-Alexander, pp. 172, 202 =Integration and nationalism= The UGRR's newspaper, Glasul Romilor, declared that the community would defend the Romanian state and its Kings \\"until death. Within our brother Roma[ni] we have never found of traitor to the State.\\" Subsequent articles \\"focused on the same three overarching themes of God, King and Country\\".Williams, p. 25 In its program, the Union pledged to support the Romanian Orthodox Church against proselytizing \\"sects\\", and promised to oversee Romani processions on Dormition Feast (August 15, chosen by the UGRR as a \\"National Day\\").Klímová-Alexander, pp. 169–170, 176; Matei, \\"Raporturile\\", p. 171 This goal was tempered by other public statements, with Lăzurică reassuring his followers that they would have freedom of worship. As noted by Klímová-Alexander, the Voivode was spuriously accused by other Romanies of wanting to make his community an appendage of official Orthodoxy; in fact, he \\"could have used the support and resources of the Church to further [his] own mobilization goals.\\"Klímová-Alexander, p. 176 On February 6, 1934, Lăzurică was granted a missionary card, which he used as his ID, notably during trips to Hunedoara County in October 1934.Matei, \\"Raporturile\\", pp. 165–166, 169 He managed to settle some nomads on land purchased by the UGRR, persuading them to undergo baptism and church marriage, also setting up a workers' co-operative and Romani-staffed schools.Klímová- Alexander, pp. 171–172; Williams, pp. 24–25. See also Achim (2004), p. 156 Despite its close association with Orthodoxy, the UGRR was also routinely accused by Șerboianu of being a proxy for the Romanian Greek Catholic Church.Klímová-Alexander, pp. 176, 201 Himself suspected of being a pro- Catholic who would endorse the \\"Romanies' Catholicization\\", Șerboianu had lost Orthodox support, which allowed the UGRR manifestos to be printed in the Church's official press.Matei, \\"Raporturile\\", pp. 162–164 The Church also provided Lăzurică with funding for his 1933 Congress.Matei (2012), pp. 58–59 Already in 1933, comments in the Western press described Lăzurică as a quasi- fascist, and an \\"exceptionally good impersonator\\" of Adolf Hitler. While the program also promised that Romanies would remain \\"aloof from all extremist parties\\" and \\"politically non-aligned\\",Klímová-Alexander, pp. 170–171, 202 in practice the UGRR was intimately associated with the far-right fringes of Romanian nationalism, including fascists. The group's first congress was reportedly attended by 20 members of the Iron Guard.Oprescu, p. 33; Matei, \\"Raporturile\\", p. 165; Williams, p. 24 Romanian Police reported on a correspondence between the Voivode and the Guard's \\"Captain\\", Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, while also noting that Lăzurică had secured support from the Police's own chief, Gavrilă Marinescu.Dieaconu & Costachie, pp. 184–185 Matei proposes that anti-Romanyism had no significance to the interwar's far-right in Romania, since \\"Romanian nationalists defined themselves through antisemitism\\". As he notes, Romanian right-wing radicals of the day could be simultaneously antisemitic and pro-Romani.Matei (2012), pp. 67–68 Codreanu personally promised to support the General Union,Matei, \\"Romii în perioada interbelică\\", p. 31 and (2012), pp. 67–68 and helped with isolating Șerboianu.Varga, p. 631 The UGRR then gave honorary membership to Codreanu and other figures on the far-right, including Nae Ionescu and Pamfil Șeicaru.Oprescu, p. 33. See also Matei, \\"Romii în perioada interbelică\\", p. 31 and (2012), pp. 67–68; Williams, p. 24 However, similar honors were bestowed on apolitical figures, including writers Adrian Maniu and Mihai Tican Rumano.Williams, p. 24 =Ouster and return= The UGRR and its rivals were equally involved in canvassing votes for Romanian parties. Months before the general elections of 1933, Lăzurică was an agent for the hard-right National Agrarian Party (PNA), instructing the Romanies to cast their vote for its candidates.Oprescu, pp. 32–33; Varga, pp. 631, 632 The AGȚR noticed such developments, accusing Lăzurică of acting as a tool of the PNA leader, Octavian Goga. In turn, Lăzurică depicted Șerboianu as an apostate of Orthodoxy, deflecting the charge of Greek Catholic proselytism toward the AGȚR itself. However, by the time of the actual vote, he himself had switched sides, opting for the more mainstream National Liberal Party and asking that all Romanies do the same.Klímová-Alexander, pp. 202–203; Oprescu, p. 33; Varga, p. 632 Lăzurică was appointed to lead an UGRR delegation expressing support for Prime Minister Ion G. Duca, while also pressing him to respond favorably to the Romanies' demands.Klímová-Alexander, p. 203 At the same time, Manolescu-Dolj and his followers took a different path, and canvassed for the Georgist Liberals.Achim (2004), p. 158; Dieaconu & Costachie, p. 185 As read by Mudure, these strategies meant \\"offering to certain Romanian mainstream politicians the support of the Gypsy vote in exchange for affirmative action policies for the Gypsies.\\" Lăzurică's final work within the General Union was a massive effort to bring Transylvania's Romanies into the Orthodox church, which included reversing their Magyarization. This culminated with a mass baptism at Blaj on May 28, 1934.Matei, \\"Raporturile\\", p. 166 Immediately after, on May 29Boangiu, p. 713; Dieaconu & Costachie, pp. 184, 185 or May 31,Matei, \\"Raporturile\\", p. 167 Lăzurică was toppled from the UGRR chairmanship and then expelled altogether. His downfall was precipitated by the spread of rumors, nominating him as a \\"fraud\\" and \\"Jew\\", and claiming that the \\"ex-Voivode\\" had defrauded a veterinary doctor.Klímová-Alexander, pp. 204–205 Lăzurică had also recruited the brothers Gheorghe and Nicolae Nicolescu as the UGRR sponsors, but then saw them turning against him.Matei, \\"Raporturile\\", pp. 166–167 The Nicolescus engineered Lăzurică's downfall, reportedly brutalizing him until he signed a document in which he falsely denied that he was a Romani. Denying him his ethnicity was a ruse not anticipated by their rival, who had otherwise made the position of chairman intangible. Lăzurică's replacement as UGRR leader, and also as Voivode, was Gheorghe Nicolescu, who served until 1941.Achim (2004), pp. 155–156; Klímová- Alexander, pp. 172, 173, 174, 204–205 Despite this change, the group continued to display fascist sympathies: according to one report, the 1935 Romani congress in Bucharest, presided upon by Nicolescu, was held in a hall decked with portraits of Hitler.Nicholas Saul, Gypsies and Orientalism in German Literature and Anthropology of the Long Nineteenth Century, p. 161. London: Legenda (Modern Humanities Association), 2007. According to a notice in Unirea Poporului newspaper, Lăzurică was supposedly invited to attend this meeting, which would have also offset any dispute between the two main factions by allowing attendees to elect their leadership.\\"Știrile săptămânii. Romii iarăși se mișcă\\", in Unirea Poporului, Issue 42/1935, p. 7 Nicolescu managed to obtain official recognition from the Romanian government, which Lăzurică had been unable to secure, and by 1939 commanded the loyalties of some 400,000 to 800,000 Romanies, grouped into 40 regional branches.Achim (2004), p. 156; Dieaconu & Costachie, pp. 181, 186; Klímová-Alexander, p. 173.

As noted by Matei, he produced a \\"national Romani mythology\\" with echoes from \\"Indianism\\", centered on a pseudohistorical ethnicity and ancestor of the Romani tribes—called Zgripți.Matei, \\"Raporturile\\", p. 172 In August 1934, he was approached by English and American Romani associations, who asked him to join an anthropological expedition to study the people's origins on the Indian subcontinent. He reportedly accepted, claiming that such investigations would provide Romanies with a \\"Palestine of their own\\".\\"Ali dobe cigani svojo Palestino?\\", in Slovenski Narod, Issue 221/1934, p. 5 A year later, he declared his intention to merge the world's Romanies into a single nation, announcing that he would set up his newspaper to promote his goal. He also stated his new conviction, namely that the Romani \\"tribe\\" was of ancient Egyptian origin. L'Intransigeant reporter René Benazec claimed that, in 1935, Lăzurică was already styling himself \\"President of the Romanies' Republic\\", but that this title too had been usurped by a third Romani leader, who also stole and used Lăzurică's business card.René Benazec, \\"Chez les pharaons des grands chemins. Les vrais Tziganes. VI. – Trois présidents pour un roi\\", in L'Intransigeant, April 19, 1935, p. 2 Lăzurică and his wife attended the 1936 Romani Congress of Kaunas as Romanian delegates, and proposed founding an international Romani newspaper.\\"Congresul internațional al Romilor\\", in Realitatea Ilustrată, Vol. X, Issue 489, June 1936, p. 5 =PNC alliance= Lăzurică still supported Orthodox missionary work, and was again involved with the far-right, caucusing with the National Christian Party (PNC) and contributing to its newspaper, Țara Noastră.Achim (2004), pp. 158–159; Dieaconu & Costachie, p. 185; Klímová-Alexander, pp. 175, 201, 203; Matei, \\"Romii în perioada interbelică\\", pp. 31–34 The PNC doctrines implied that Romanies were a traditional and assimilable minority, which, unlike the Romanian Jews, posed no threat to the \\"Romanian bourgeoisie\\", and were even \\"useful to the Romanian nation\\".Matei, \\"Romii în perioada interbelică\\", pp. 31–35 In a February 1937 article for Manolescu-Dolj's newspaper Timpul, he stated a revised account on the Zgripți origin, depicting them as Bactrians who had rejected Brahmin customs to continue their nomadic lifestyles, and who were famed throughout Asia for their military prowess and courage. They had only been driven out of their homeland by Mongol invasions, splitting into three groups, only one of which was Egyptian.Duminică, pp. 94–95 From August 5, 1936, Lăzurică was an honorary chairman of Apostol Matei's new group, called \\"Redemption of the Romani Men and Women in Romania\\"; he was colleagues there with Miron Cristea, the Patriarch of All Romania. The \\"Redemption\\" expanded on the UGRR goals, promising protectionism for Romani traders, in preference to \\"foreign\\" ones, as well as envisaging full equality of treatment between Romanies and Romanians.Klímová-Alexander, pp. 174–175 Lăzurică was also in a position to destabilize Nicolescu's relationship with the Church, obtaining that UGRR men be stripped of their positions as Christian missionaries.Varga, p. 633. See also Matei, \\"Raporturile\\", p. 169 Nevertheless, Nicolescu was able to win over the Church, slowly pushing it away from its endorsement of Lăzurică.Matei, \\"Raporturile\\", pp. 168–170 In July 1937, writing for the Romani edition of Țara Noastră, Lăzurică attacked Romanian Jews, or \\"kikes\\", for being \\"alien to the problems and national interests of the Romanian nation, playing the communist tune\\"; Romanies, on the other hand, were loyal.Matei, \\"Romii în perioada interbelică\\", p. 33 He also announced the creation of a Citizens' Association of Roma in Romania (ACRR), which he insisted was not a separate ethnic party. It immediately formed a cartel with the PNC for the local elections of that summer, being promised that every commune would have at least one Romani councilor.Matei, \\"Romii în perioada interbelică\\", pp. 33–34 This alliance was ridiculed by the PNC's rivals from the National Peasants' Party, but Țara Noastră defended it as a natural outcome: the Romanies and the Romanians \\"shaped each other through a shared destiny\\".Matei, \\"Romii în perioada interbelică\\", pp. 34–35 This affiliation also reunited the deposed Voivode with rivals Șerboianu and Manolescu-Dolj, all of whom were accused by the UGRR of seeking to present themselves as PNC candidates in the general election of December.Achim (2004), pp. 158–159; Dieaconu & Costachie, pp. 185–186 The ACRR recruited its members in Dolj and Ialomița;Klímová-Alexander, pp. 175, 201 the former branch was under his direct supervision.Dieaconu & Costachie, p. 186 The UGRR press reacted against this new competitor, reviving claims that Lăzurică was a crypto-Catholic who had personally promised Pope Pius XI that he would convert Romania's Romanies.Klímová-Alexander, p. 201 In September 1937, news agencies reported that Lăzurică had been poisoned with hemlock by \\"Left Wing Gipsies\\", for being an \\"ardent Nazi\\".\\"Hemlock in Wine. Gipsy 'Prince' Poisoned\\", in The Age, September 3, 1937, p. 12 Boangiu writes that, as the conflict between the two Voivodes was turning bitter, both figures engaged in \\"obvious manipulation\\" of the truth.Boangiu, p. 713 As noted by Matei, Lăzurică and Șerboianu, who had fully reconciled, \\"could pass for Romani leaders\\" when negotiating with their PNC counterparts, Goga and A. C. Cuza; instead, the UGRR remained tied to the mainstream National Liberals.Matei, \\"Raporturile\\", p. 171 The PNC government, appointed after the 1937 election, imposed laws for the \\"Romanianization\\" of Romania's economy, including the ouster of \\"racial\\" minorities; the Romanies, however, were entirely spared.Achim (2004), p. 163 At an ACRR rally held at Craiova on February 2, 1938, Lăzurică announced that he had joined the PNC and, again, that he supported its antisemitic doctrines.Dieaconu & Costachie, p. 186; Oprescu, p. 33; Varga, pp. 633–634 He described Romania as invaded by Jewish \\"lice\\", and praised the PNC leadership for clamping down on the \\"kikes' newspapers\\".Oprescu, p. 33; Varga, pp. 633–634 =Aftermath= Soon after, the activities of all Romani groups were curtailed by the imposition of an authoritarian Constitution and of a single- party rule by the National Renaissance Front (FRN).Achim (2004), p. 156; Klímová-Alexander, p. 173 Nevertheless, the UGRR was still tolerated, the regime having concluded that it \\"did not do anything which threatened the security of the state\\".Klímová-Alexander, p. 205 Its entire leadership, Nicolescu included, joined the Front as early as March 1938. The authoritarian drive pushed Lăzurică away from Patriarch Cristea, who had been appointed Prime Minister after the PNC's recall. Both he and Șerboianu came to display their Catholic sympathies. In one such show of support for Catholicism, Lăzurică abandoned references to the Dormition as a Romani holiday, and proclaimed the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul as the new date of reference.Matei, \\"Raporturile\\", pp. 171–172 With articles in Țara Noastră and Timpul, Lăzurică endorsed claims that Orthodoxy was a traditional persecutor of the Zgripți and Romani people, which it had kept as church slaves.Matei, \\"Raporturile\\", pp. 171–172. See also Duminică, p. 95 Cristea reacted by having Lăzurică removed from the ranks of its missionaries, citing concerns that he had converted. Lăzurică informed his readers that he handed in his card myself, and that he felt \\"sickened\\" by the affair. The FRN's one measure against any Romanies was taken in December 1939, when nomads were forced to submit to inspections by public health officials.Oprescu, p. 33; Varga, pp. 634–635 As late as July 1940, Orthodox dignitaries still complained to the authorities about Lăzurică and the ACRR having \\"insulted the Church\\". Their reports were most likely anachronistic, as neither the group nor its leader were still active by then. Although it banned all Romani organizations, the National Legionary State, established by the Iron Guard that September, remained generally tolerant of the Romanies as a group. However, the influence of Nazi Germany and scientific racism began seeping into its official propaganda.Achim (2004), pp. 166–167 The subsequent period saw the emergence of a strong anti-Romanyism in Romanian society, and the degeneration of relations between Romani activists and the Romanian far-right. Shortly after his clash with the Iron Guard, dictator Ion Antonescu singled out the Romanies as fundamentally anti-social.Achim (2004), p. 168. See also Oprescu, p. 34 According to Mudure, Lăzurică's activities, and the impact they had on Romani visibility, had unwittingly contributed to this conceptualization of a \\"Gypsy problem\\". This discourse was eventually adopted by the Antonescu regime, and produced the deportation of over 20,000 Romanies into the Transnistria Governorate.Achim (2004), pp. 167–185; Mudure, pp. 65–66; Oprescu, p. 34; Varga, pp. 635–641 For those Romanies who were deemed as more compliant, deportation was advertised as a work of colonization, granting each family a plot of land and a ready-built house.Oprescu, p. 34 Around 1943, Romanian authorities began circulating the notion that the usage and recognition of romi was a liability, since it introduced confusion between Romanians and \\"Gypsies\\".Matei (2012), pp. 69–70 Following Antonescu's toppling in August 1944, the UGRR was reestablished, with Nicolescu as its leader, and with the specific goal of assisting Transnistria deportees making their way back home.Achim (2010), pp. 452–454 Renamed Romani People's Union, it survived for less than five years. In 1949, the new communist regime began investigating its activities, noting that, although useful in combating \\"panhandling and theft by some of the Gypsies\\", it was politically suspect—with one board member alleged to have been active within the Iron Guard. Nicolescu had by then been compromised for associating the UGRR with National Liberal Party–Bejan. In January 1949, he was deposed and replaced with Petre Rădiță, himself a lapsed member of the Democratic Nationalist Party.Achim (2010), pp. 454, 457–458 The UGRR and all other community organizations were outlawed that same year, as part of a process which ended in its refusal to recognize Romanies as a distinct minority.Achim (2004), pp. 189–190 & (2010), passim Notes References *Viorel Achim, **The Roma in Romanian History.

She was considered to be a strong, spiritual lady of war and fame. Panhtwar is referring to (sic) \\"beautiful in three ways within one day\\". Legend According to legend, Panhtwar was the only daughter of Sula Thamawa, a son of Maha Thado Yarzar (King Naga Naing), the legendary King of Tagaung Kingdom. Her mother Sanda Muhki, was the Ogress-nymph from Lanka Dipa. Her history records the wars period between Sri Ksetra and Beikthano and of the fighting that took place. Beikthano was created for Panhtwar by the Hindu god Vishnu because she was assumed as the little sister of Vishnu in previous life. Beikthano is a small kingdom in ruled by Queen Panhtwar. The other kingdoms are larger and stronger, so they want to come and take over hers. Every time they tried, even though they outnumbered her kingdom in men and equipment, they never succeeded. Because the queen was able to repel all her enemy forces with the help of magical drum named \\"Atula Sidaw\\", gave by Sakra, the Lord of Celestial Beings. When Queen Panhtwar banged onto the drum, the magic drum would be sounded making the water of the Yan Pe River (lit. Repelling enemies river) to rise rapidly and flood the surrounding plain so that no attacking army could cross it. Pan Htwar statue in the shrine One day, King of Sri Ksetra Duttabaung made some of his subjects disguise themselves as imitate monks and they worshipped her so she let them stay in the palace. Then, they sabotaged the drums so the alarm could not be set off. The next day, when the soldiers attacked, the drum did not work when she hit it. She then lost her kingdom and so the king took her as his wife and also took the whole kingdom. Duttabaung was the son of Maha Thamawa, the twin brother of Sula Thamawa. So, Duttabaung was a cousin of Panhtwar. The King's other consorts were jealous of her beauty, and conspired against her. They told Duttabaung that her loveliness was a magic trick, and that in fact she resembled a horrible ogre. The King unfortunately believed in what they said and abandoned her. So because she is resilient, she wanted her kingdom back and couldn't take on the place of Queen of this kingdom she did not know so she was not happy. So every day, she makes the King lose power in some way as much as she can. Therefore, one day, she offered a face-cloth to Duttabaung. Really it was the lower end of her htamein. The King used it and lost his power and glory. One day, Duttabaung traveling around the country by his royal barge. At the time, a dragon under water attacked his barge. The King couldn't fight back the dragon as he had lost his glory and he was eaten by the dragon. Finally, Panhtwar was successful in revenging Duttabaung. But, she did something so bad onto the King that the other wives saw and could not forgive her. So then the other queens harassed her to the point she killed herself. Most of the child from Myanmar knew about her and they were in loved with Queen Panhtwar in their bed time story since they were young also. Queen Panhtwar was really brave queen who love her kingdom with her whole life. Spiritual life and worship The statue of goddess Pan Htwar After she died, all of her history was carried on by the people throughout one generation to another. Some people said that she loved her kingdom so much that after she died, she became a goddess and she was taking care of the citizens in the kingdom with her spiritual powers. She is also the goddess of the deep forest, called Mahar Myaing. When the villager or the people who lived around that area, want something, they make a wish to her or worship her and all their wishes would become true.Til today, people still believe that she's real and so they have her statue and other duplicates of her all around Myanmar.When the people who worship her move to another area, they never forget to do another duplicate statue of her because they believe that if they keep their traditional worship on her, all the wishes will come true.During the Buddhist Lent, the villagers from Mhaw Zar and Mu Htaw villages would collect donations to fund a ceremony of worship for Panhtwar, held on the eve of the full moon day of Waso.

Life  Anna Feodorowna Spengler was born in Saint Petersburg which at that time was home to a large and apparently permanent German expatriate community. Her mother, Karoline Spengler, was a stage actress. Her father, Franz Spengler, was a theatre director from Prague. However, he died while she was still young. When the child was ten her mother married a third husband, the actor Karl Friedrich Krüger: he adopted Anna. Mother and daughter now became respectively Karoline Krüger and Anna Krüger: these are the names by which they are normally identified in sources. Her parents recognised and encouraged her talent as an actress. She made her stage debut as \\"Amalie\\" in Schickaneder's Hauer in Österreich at Schickaneder's recently opened and lavishly appointed Theater an der Wien (in Vienna) on 1 September 1804. The play appears not to have survived, but Schickaneder's new theatre prospered and Anna Krüger remained there as part of the company till 1808 or 1809. In 1808 Emanuel Schikaneder took a position as director at the Reduta Theatre in Brünn (as the city was known to German speakers at the time). Anna Feodorowna was among those who went with him, and it was here that she took her first major stage roles. However, by 1809 she was back in Vienna where at Easter of that year she made her debut at the Hofbühne Theater, where her (adoptive) father was already an established member of the company. It was here that she came to the fore as a performer. In 1814 she enjoyed great success appearing for a season of guest performances down-river at Pest. On 19 July 1814 she made her last stage appearance, taking the part of \\"Afanasia\\" in \\"Benjowsky\\". By this time she was suffering badly with what were probably complications from Typhus (\\"Nervenfieber\\"). She had evidently been infected - seemingly without taking time out for proper treatment - for some time. She died on 4 August 1814 and was buried amidst much ceremony on the part of theatre friends and colleagues on the section reserved for artists who had died young in the cemetery at Pest.

It has greyish, felty hairy, or hairless leaves that are broadly wedge-shaped to very broadly inverted egg-shaped, 5–8½ cm (2–3½ in) long and 2–6½ cm (¾–2½ in) wide and whorl-shaped flower heads that have shades of pale yellow to crimson, of 2–4 cm (0.8–1.6 in) long and 1–2 cm (0.4–0.8 in) wide that grow in clusters of three to ten. Their long styles that emerge from the head jointly give the impression of a pincushion, with the pins upright. It is called Langeberg pincushion in English. Flowering heads can be found between July and November. It naturally occurs in fynbos in the Western Cape province of South Africa.  Description  Leucospermum mundii is an upright, rounded and richly branching shrub of ½–1 m (1½–3 ft) high, that develops from a trunk at its base. The flowering stems are 5–6 mm (0.20–0.24 in) thick and grey due to a thick layer of felty hairs. The greyish, felty hairy or hairless leaves are broadly wedge- shaped to very broadly inverted egg-shaped, 5–8½ cm (2–3½ in) long and 2–6½ cm (¾–2½ in) wide, almost seated or with a very short stalk and seven to seventeen teeth near the tip. The flower heads have a whorl shape (or are turbinate), are 2–4 cm (0.8–1.6 in) long and 1–2 cm (0.4–0.8 in) wide, and grow in clusters of three to ten. Each is on a stalk of 1–1½ cm (0.4–0.6 in) long. The common base of the flowers in the same head is flattened and 6–7 mm (0.24–0.28 in) wide. The bracts that subtend the head have a pointy tip and are lance-shaped to oval, 5–7 mm (0.20–0.28 in) long and 3–5 mm (0.12–0.20 in) wide, overlapping, cartilaginous in consistency, densely silky, the tip slightly hooked and thickened. The bract that subtends each flower individually is rectangular, about 5 mm (0.20 in) long and 2 mm (0.08 in) wide, embraces the flower at its base (or obtrullate), cartilaginous in consistency, densely softly hairy, the tip hooked. The initially yellow, 4-merous perianth is 16–18 mm (0.64–0.72 in) long. The lowest, fully merged, part of the perianth, called tube is dull carmine in colour, 8–10 mm long, narrow cylinder-shaped and hairless at its base and inflated and powdery hairy higher up. The middle part (or claws), where the perianth is split lengthwise is initially pale yellow but changes to orange with age. It consists of four thread-thin, roughly hairy lobes that all individually curved back near their tip. The upper part (or limbs), which enclosed the pollen presenter in the bud, consists of four pale green, pointy, elliptic to lance-shaped lobes of about 1½ mm (0.06 in) long. From the perianth emerges a straight, thread- shaped, pale yellow style of 2½–2⅞ cm (1–1⅛ in) long. The thickened part at the tip of the style called pollen presenter is thread-thin, bluntly cylinder- shaped, ½–1 mm (0.02–0.04 in) long and hard to distinguish from the style. It has a groove that functions as the stigma across the very tip. The ovary is subtended by four opaque, blunt, thread-shaped scales of 2–2½ mm (0.08–0.10 in) long. The subtribe Proteinae, to which the genus Leucospermum has been assigned, consistently has a basic chromosome number of twelve (2n=24). = Differences with related species = Leucospermum mundii differs from all other taxa in the section Crinitae by its broad wedge to inverted egg-shaped leaves, topped by seven to seventeen teeth.  Taxonomy  As far as we know, the Langeberg pincushion was first collected by Leopold Mund in the Tradouw mountains. Probably because the flower heads were already in a fruiting stage when collected, Mund proposed to call it L. purpureum. Carl Meissner used this specimen to describe the species but called it Leucadendron mundii in 1856. Otto Kuntze who lumped many species, moved the species in 1891 to Leucadendron, in the process making a writing error in the species name as leucadendron mundtii. John Patrick Rourke in 1970, regards these names as synonymous. L. mundii has been assigned to the section Crinitae. The species name mundii refers to the plant hunter Leopold Mund.  Distribution and ecology  Leucospermum mundii can be found in the Langeberg mountain range, where it is known from only a few localitions, between Garcia's Pass, above Riversdale and Goedgeloof Peak, above Swellendam, where it grows on northern slopes in southwest facing gorges at 300–900 m (1000–3000 ft) altitude. These are very well drained positions on Table Mountain Sandstone, but the average annual precipitation of anywhere between 635 and 1015 mm (25–40 in) is relatively high for the Cape. The plants grow in a dense fynbos vegetation that further is dominated by several Restionaceae, Protea eximia, P. neriifolia, and Leucadendron eucalyptifolium.

The main part of The Priory was designed by William Weaver and Henry Hardie Kemp, and built from 1847 to 1874 by Thomas Stubbs, The Marist Fathers in Australia, and Thomas Salter. It is also known as Gladesville Hospital, Gladesville Asylum and The Priory and curtilage. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 3 December 2004.  History  =Indigenous history= At the time of European contact the Kelly's bush area was inhabited by the Wal Umedegal Clan who spoke the Guringai language. They lived primarily on fish and shellfish, supplementing their diet when necessary with vegetables, marsupials, birds and grubs. They were also frequently observed firing the scrub both to facilitate access to the foreshore and to flush out game. Very little is known of their social structure and religious beliefs.Pitt, 2011. =Colonial history= Captain John Hunter (1737-1821) of the Sirius, charted Sydney Harbour in 1788. On 28 January 1788 he wrote in his journal: \\"A few days after my arrival with the transports in Port Jackson, I set off with a six-oared boat and a small boat, intending to make as good a survey of the harbour as circumstances would admit: I took to my assistance Mr Bradley, the first lieutenant, Mr Keltie, the master, and a young gentleman of the quarter-deck (midshipman Henry Waterhouse).\\" Hunter's meticulous chart shows 30 depth soundings around the peninsula bounded by the Parramatta and Lane Cove rivers. Hunter was Governor of the Colony from 1795-1800. He is commemorated in the name of .Sherry/Hunters Hill Historical Society, 2011, p.15. In 1855 a speculative housing venture of erecting four prefabricated Swiss Cottages at Hunters Hill was underway. In this period Hunters Hill was an established French enclave, with the residence of the French consul located there at \\"Passy\\", and much of its early development was constructed by men of French descent. The prefabricated houses were advertised as \\"four splendid family residences, standing in their own grounds, of about 1 acres each\\", with \\"wood and water in abundance\\".Sherry, 1989, p.48. Beverley Sherry in her study of Hunter Hill notes that this was the first planned group of houses to be built in the municipality, marking the beginning of the garden suburb character of Australia's oldest Garden Suburb. The subdivision and garden suburb development occurred in the mid to late nineteenth century, predating the formation of the Garden Suburb movement. The historic development at Hunters Hill was consistently speculative, although some of the subdivisions were undertaken to provide residences for family members. =Thomas Stubbs, 1835-1847= Thomas Stubbs purchased two allotments of land at the head of Tarban Creek in 1835. This land adjoined the first land grants, part of the Eastern Farms, towards the western end of the present Municipality of Hunters Hill. Stubbs built a sandstone far, house, outbuildings and began farming his , now called 'the Stubbs Wing'. =Marist Fathers, 1847-1874= The Marists had arrived in Australia in December 1837, after establishing mission stations on two South-west Pacific islands, Wallis and Futuna. In 1847 Stubbs sold his two blocks to Fr. Jean-Louis Rocher of the Marist Fathers who were looking to establish a base for missionaries in the South Pacific. The Fathers built a new building on the site in 1857 which they called \\"Villa Maria\\" , moving in immediately and this forming the base for the Marist Pacific Missions which incorporated part of and extended Stubbs original sandstone farmhouse. The new building was designed by architect-engineer, William Weaver in a Palladian or Old Colonial Regency style. Weaver worked in New South Wales from 1851 to 1864. He served as Colonial Architect from 1855–56, then set up in private practice, aged 28, at 25 Pitt Street, Sydney. The colonial economy was prospering, the new Sydney Railway was running as far as Liverpool and suburban development encouraged speculative building. Villa Maria (now known as the Priory) is one surviving example of Weaver's first year in private practice. It was commenced in February 1857, completed that November at a cost of 1685 pounds and built by local stonemasons. The long eastern front with stone flagged verandah has a fine and unaltered Georgian symmetry favoured by Weaver for his residence designs. Another of his favourite features evident in Villa Maria is the extension of the sides to the back of the building creating a courtyard. The plan incorporated a pre-1847 cottage as a northern wing. Accounts signed by Weaver indicate a smooth and rapid progress of construction. The renamed Villa Maria reorientated the original farmhouse towards the harbour, taking full advantage of the site and view. The Marist Fathers continued to farm the land and, amongst numerous other activities, extended Stubb's vineyards. The property contained vast orchards, vineyards and gardens and provided rest and recuperation for the Marist Fathers' South Pacific missionaries. Goods and materials were bought and stored here to supply the Pacific Island mission stations. The house was also used for rest and recuperation for missionaries exhausted from their work on the island mission stations. During its period as \\"Villa Maria\\", a wooden chapel on the site was the resting place of the body of St Peter Chanel, Proto-martyr of Oceania from 7 May 1849 till some time before February 1850 when it was taken to France. Fr Peter (Pierre) Chanel met his martyrdom on the island of Futuna, on 28 April 1841; he was canonised in 1954. It was also the residence of Blessed Giovanni Mazzucconi on his arrival in the region in 1852 and again immediately before his martyrdom, by New Guinea Islanders, in 1855. These associations make the Priory a place of exceptional importance both for Australian Catholics and for Australians of French or Italian background. The establishment of the South Sea mission house by the Marist Fathers was the first presence of French settlers in the Municipality of Hunters Hill. From 1853, however, the Fathers began acquiring land on the other side of Tarban Creek. The small size of available dwellings on the property, and large numbers of people sometimes accommodated there, made some kind of expansion essential. There was sandstone on the property, which could be quarried and one of the Marist Brothers, Gennade Rolland was an able stonemason and iron worker, which would make the work economical. An impressive two-storey stone structure was built in 1857, the architects being Weaver and Henry Hardie Kemp (1859–1946). This stands at right angles to the original dwelling. It appears that the Marist fathers had moved to another newly constructed \\"Villa Maria\\" (in Hunters Hill) by 1864 and that site remains in their ownership to the present day. In 1862 an attempt had been made to sell the original Villa Maria to the government for the (Gladesville) Mental Hospital, which failed. It was interesting as an attempt, because the property was eventually sold to the state for this purpose many years later, and not by the Marists. They retained the property for some years, using it as a convent. FInally they sold it to Thomas Salter in 1874, rather cheaply. =Thomas Salter, 1874-1888= Although the Brothers were unable to immediately sell the old mission house upon their removal, by 1874 Thomas Salter had acquired the house and farmland for A£2,000. He renamed the house \\"The Priory\\" and added his own L-shaped, picturesque gothic extension, now called 'the Salter Wing', added , behind Weaver's Palladian front on the north west. A map of 1885 shows the layout of Salter's land. It addition to the original kitchen, the Old Mission House and extensive stone terracing, the map shows the footprint of a shed, bush house, latrines, out house, tennis court, stables and coach houses. The position of the garden, poultry yard and cultivation paddock are clearly marked. =Gladesville Hospital, 1888= When Thomas Salter moved from The Priory to Brynault in Mount Street in 1887 he sold the land to Gladesville Mental Hospital, the earliest psychiatric hospital on the Australian mainland. The Priory became the first hospital building to be utilised on the Riverglade Campus, the area of the hospital on the northern side of Victoria Road. For more than 60 years the surrounding land was farmed by patients for the production of fruit and vegetables for hospital use. Land reclaimed along the Tarban Creek shoreline extended the arable area. A Metropolitan Sewerage & Drainage Board map of 1928 shows, in addition to the kitchen, shed, latrines, out house and Old Mission House identified on the map of 1885, a new large stables building to the west at the rear of the house and the cow bails building alongside the kitchen. The Priory is labelled the dairy on this map. 1887-1947: the surrounding land was farmed by patients for the production of fruit and vegetables for hospital use. Land reclaimed along Tarban Creek shoreline extended the arable area. =Twentieth Century changes= A 1928 map shows a large stables building to the south at the rear of the house and the cow bails building alongside the kitchen. The Priory is labelled \\"The Dairy\\" on this map. The western verandah form varies from that on the 1885 survey plan and it appears a single storey pavilion of the Weaver extension may have been extended to the west. Little change occurred over the site in the early 20th century. Land below the Mission House was used as a golf course in the 1920s and 1930s, and the house istelsf used as the Ladies' Club House. The main evidence of war-time occupancy of Gladesville Hospital - is the air raid shelter (near the vegetable gardens, later used as a garden storage shed) and an ablution block, built more recently and the only intrusive structure on site. The air raid shelter was for patients and staff at the hospital and was cut into the terrace alongside the Weaver wing's main front. 1950s changes included: alterations to The Priory building; demolition of the Mission House in 1952, conversion of the cow shed into a store and cleaning room, following fires in 1954 and 1958; and removal of Salter's stone garden store in 1955. 1967 NSW Public Works Department changes: 1966 and 1967 plans show modifications made during the 1967 NSW Public Works Department maintenance program. Toilets to the rear of the pavilion of the Weaver wing were removed to convert the space to a boiler room and a tank and stand erected to the south. These have since been removed. A brick extension, with a clip-lock roof, was added to the south of the boiler room to provide a new shower and toilet facilities. This necessitated excavation and building the retaining wall to the west. Two of the windows in the rear wall of the Weaver pavilion were filled in and the third converted to a doorway to the new extension. Fire escape doors were inserted into window openings in the west wall of the Weaver wing and the south wall of the Salter wing, and metal stairs attached. These were later removed and the windows reconstructed. A commercial kitchen was installed, , at the western end of the Salter wing. This required removal of walls, fireplaces, floors and joinery. The fitout of the kitchen was removed in a later upgrade of the house, and the servery between kitchen and dining room filled in and the surface re-finished. A building maintenance program in 1967 saw a number of modifications made: various alterations to front and rear verandahs, removal or blocking (up) of chimneys and repair and replacement of joinery. Internal finishes such as wall and ceiling plaster were changed. A timber-framed tank stand was built on the southern elevation (later removed) and there were excavations and rebuilding of retaining walls. The grounds were also altered in this period: earlier, in 1889, mud flats at Tarban Creek were filled to provide more agricultural land. This area was cultivated continuously until the 1950s. In 1957, approximately 100 tons of soil from the vegetable garden was removed to build a sports oval on the southern side of Victoria Road. The citrus orchard, possibly remaining in the Marist Brothers period, was buried by fill in the mid-1970s and 1980s. These extensive episodes of filling have altered the landscape of The Priory and Tarban Creek. More recently, The Priory had been a ward for patients who although rehabilitated, still required supervision. Nearby vegetable gardens still supplied the hospital and were tended by patients. =Riverglade Hospital, 1975-85= In 1975 the Asylum area north of Victoria Road was renamed the Riverglade Hospital and given over to care for the developmentally-disabled. The Priory itself formally operated as patient accommodation until 1985, known as Ward 2. The last few patients moved out by the end of 1985. It was then occupied by NSW Government's Mental Health Review Tribunal offices and staff. Further repairs and alterations ahead of the new occupation included removal of ceilings and cornices to the Stubbs and Salter wings, removal of the whole roof slating to the Stubbs wing (in 1985), replacement of external doors with modern designs, replacement of door hardware and removal of original flagging to the northern (Stubbs wing) porch. 1981 drawings show planned changes to The Priory that don't appear to have been made. The west facade of the Weaver wing may have had additional openings previously. It is possible that NSW Department of Public Works had documentary evidence at this time relating to a former balcony and rear openings, which it planned to reinstate. 1994 Subdivision, rezoning and future adaptive reuse: The lot boundary of The Priory was reduced in 1994 when the property was subdivided by the State Government. The Priory on Lot 1 of DP823988 was retained in Government use and an area surrounding it to the north, east and south was sold into private ownership. The Priory continued use as offices until the Mental Health Review Tribunal vacated in 1/2003. The State Government sold the land surrounding the Priory, including the subject site, to private developers in 1994. The subdivision of the larger number of sites containing the entire curtilage of the Priory was approved by the Crown Lands Office and Hunters Hill Council in the same year. The boundaries of the subject site were established in a subdivision approved by Hunters Hill Council in 1997. This boundary followed the boundary set by Council for \\"heritage conservation\\" in its Hunters Hill Local Environmental Plan 18 (LEP), gazetted in 1993. The LEP zones the area of the Priory as \\"heritage conservation\\" which permits any form of development on the land compatible with the heritage significance of the listed item 309 - the Priory and the Priory curtilage. To ascertain what is compatible with the heritage significance of the site, the former owners, Keppel Land, sought heritage advice from consultants Godden Mackay Logan in 1999. This initial investigation into appropriate development options for the site recommended that residential use would be compatible in heritage terms with the heritage significance of the Priory, provided that its siting, form and scale does not detract from the significance and setting of the Priory. In 2003 the Department of Health vacated the site and it was uninhabited for some time. A development application for an apartment building concentrated development into the south-west corner of the Priory's former site to minimise the adverse impacts on land within the SHR curtilage. The application included a detached house within an area enclosed by tall hedges. More than half of that site will be dedicated to the public as a reserve. The applicant consulted with the Heritage Office in selecting sites as part of the process of listing the Priory on the State Heritage Register in 2004. Following public concerns the apartment building was reduced by one storey (i.e. now of four stories) eliminating 2 units. All but two of the trees were kept and the detached house was reduced in height. In 2006 development approval was given for construction of town houses south-west of The Priory, on Lot 201 DP878383. Land immediately north and east of The Priory has been dedicated for use as public open space. The Health Department transferred their ownership of the site to the Department of Lands and on 1 November 2007 the then Minister Tony Kelly MLC, added The Priory and its surrounds to the Riverglade Reserve (R100263) Trust, administered by Hunters Hill Council. =Preservation and community use= On 1 November 2007 Kelly, as Minister for Lands, transferred the care, control and management of The Priory and its grounds to Hunters Hill Council to remain in public hands. On the same day the Mayor, Cr. Susan Hoopmann launched The Priory Preservation and Restoration Trust, which manages the property and operates a public fund for tax-deductible donations from the community towards its restoration, preservation and embellishment. Council intends that The Priory develop into a cultural and heritage hub for the wider community and the people of Hunters Hill. It is envisaged this will comprise art and museum space, meeting facilities, gardens for weddings and other events, in addition to a commercial facility providing coffee and other refreshments.  Description  =The Main building= The Priory's main building is built of locally quarried sandstone and has slate roofs and consists of three parts. The main part (fronting southeast) was designed as a marine villa by William Weaver. It is Palladian in form with a two-storey central block and single storey wings, the north-eastern wing being longer than the southern. The wing on the northeast incorporates the earlier stone cottage built by Thomas Stubbs and, at the northern end of this, Thomas Salter added an \\"L\\" shaped picturesque Gothic structure. =Outbuildings and landscape= The main building is set on a sandstone terrace and flanked to the south and east and north by further sandstone and in places brick retaining wall terracing, some rectilinear, some curving. The surrounding landscape includes a number of former outbuildings, structures and their remnants. The stone kitchen is located to the north, stone terraces define the former garden, a brick air raid shelter is located south of the main building. Also to the south is the footprint of a former building described as \\"latrine\\" on an early plan. Archaeological remains include the cow bail site, the stables, the turning circle and road layout. Evidence of original plantings exists in the significant clumps of trees to the east, north and west of the Priory building. Main tree species include: camphor laurels (Cinnamomum camphora) form a street planting avenue west on Salter Street; a number of Lombardy poplars (Populus nigra \\"Italica\\" west and north-west of the main building lining old drives/ approaches; also lining the main approach north of the main building are a number of Mediterranean cypresses (Cupressus sempervirens), two funeral cypress (C.funebris) at the base of a flight of steps off the terrace to the north (driveway); and some native cypress pines (Callitris rhomboidea/columellaris) - a line of this same tree is also uphill and south of the main building. East and north-east of the main building and below a sandstone curved terrace are a number of pollarded jacarandas (J.mimosifolia); a red ash (Alphitonia excelsa); a Canary Island date palm (Phoenix canariensis), a number of sweet pittosporum (P.undulatum) and creeping fig on the sandstone wall. Two silky oak trees (Grevillea robusta) are south and west of the main building. A moderate-sized Hill's fig (Ficus microcarpa 'Hillii') is on a grass terrace west of the main building. North of the main building and below the driveway are two \\"English\\" oaks (Quercus robur). The site has several Canary Island date palms (north, north-east and east of the main building). A number of trees appear to be seedlings from bird-dropped seed, either growing in retaining walls or below them, or terraces. These include to the south and south-west of the main building two large Ficus rubiginosa (Port Jackson fig) growing adventitiously on sandstone retaining walls. A number of sweet pittosporum are around the main building and its lawn margins. Other seedling Port Jackson figs are growing up other trees as epiphytes, from bird- dropped seed. A large brush box (Lophostemon confertus) on a terrace south of the main building. A steel pipe arbour and a circular flat lawn area are west of the main building. On the arbour is a yellow Mrs Banks' rose (Rosa banksiae 'Aurea').Two small bottlebrush trees (Callistemon sp.) are on a lower grass terrace west of the main building. These appear to date from the 1970s or 1980s. A screen of crepe myrtles (Lagerstroemia indica) are south of the main building, appearing to have been planted as screens. Hedges also form part of this southern and south-western part of the site, with Cape honeysuckle/tecoma (Tecomaria capensis) and Cape plumbago (P.capensis) being prominent on retaining walls and property boundaries here.Read, Stuart, site visit, 3 September 2009. = Condition = As at 17 June 2003, The Priory building was in good condition with its surrounding landscape having high archaeological potential. Archaeological remains include the cow bail site, the stables (excavated since 2008), the turning circle and road layout. The nearby freshwater creek flowing into the harbour is likely to have been regularly visited by Aboriginal people in the past. Any proposal for services ducts across Tarban Creek would need to be considered in relation to impacts on potential maritime archaeology. The immediate surrounding landscape of this site contains a number of former outbuildings, structures and remnants with the potential to yield further information about how the site was used by each of its past occupants. These structures include former kitchen, stone terraces that define the garden layout, air raid shelter and footings to the \\"latrine\\" or garden building. The immediate surrounding landscape contains a number of archaeological sites (including cow bail site, stables, turning circle and road layout) all able to yield further information about the use of site past occupants. Evidence of original plantings exists in significant clumps of trees to the east, north and west of the Priory. These provide important information about the evolution and layout of the formal garden and surrounding landscape over time. Former outbuildings, archaeological sites and original plantings have value in interpreting the use of the Priory and the potential to yield information of wider relevance to history of NSW. The remains of a stable dating from the early twentieth century were found on the site of the proposed apartment building in 2001. These remains are wall footings consisting of plain dry-press bricks bonded with Portland type cement and possibly rendered with Portland cement. These stable remains belong to the Government Asylum phase and not to an earlier nineteenth-century period related to the construction and expansion of the Priory villa. The Archaeological Assessment Report by Robert Varman 2001 found that the remains of the stables date from or later, and are not of sufficient significance to justify a requirement for in situ conservation. These remains date from the Government Asylum period after 1888, and are not \\"generally sympathetic to the form and style of the Priory up to that time.\\" The materials recovered in the test trench were common building products of twentieth-century industrial processes. The quantity of remains has been found to be quite minimal in the test trenching. For these reasons, it would be acceptable to allow the excavation for the apartment block to remove the known archaeological remains according to Heritage Office procedures. The site for the proposed new dwelling house on site 2 is less sensitive, being adjacent to the site of a later building, Ward 3. This asylum building was demolished and its site cleared of top soil prior to the investigations for the CMP.Heritage Office report, 2008. In 2011, the slate roof, guttering and downpipes needed repair.Grant application, 2011. As a fine example of the colonial regency style still remaining in a legible picturesque landscape, the Priory has an integrity that is unique. Its setting is highly vulnerable, as evidenced in the housing developments at (now named) Botanic Cove to the south. = Modifications and dates = The Priory has seen a number of modifications since its establishment: *1847: Stubbs built by 1847 the original stone farm cottage *1857: Marist Fathers commissioned William Weaver designed new adjoining Palladian style building fronting view to harbour. A courtyard and terracing were created to rehabiltate the stone quarry created to construct the Weaver addition. *1853-74 Marist Fathers acquired more (on the other side of Tarban Creek) land, relocating in 1864. *1862 First Villa Maria failed to sell to Government for mental hospital. Property retained for some years, and was used as a convent for some of this time. Marist Brothers continued farming the site. *1874+ Thomas Salter added picturesque Gothic \\"L\\" shaped addition at western end of Northern (Stubbs) wing, comprising two rooms (and most likely the entrance porch), bringing the house's total to 14 rooms plus outhouses. *1885 plan shows: coach house at southern end, a well, small poultry yards the southern end, a tennis lawn, the Old Session House (which appears to have had additions to the north and south), an outhouse, latrines, the main house and verandahs on south, east and west, a bush house in the south-western corner of the courtyard, sheds, kitchen building, stables, a coach house, large poultry yard and cultivation paddock north of the house and a carriage way to Salter Street. Terracing of the site is also visible on this plan. *1887: The Priory became the first (Gladesville) Hospital building to be used on the Riverglade Cmapus, the area of the hospital on the northern side of Victoria Road. By 1890 there were 1020 patients in the asylum, 38 of whom were kept in The Priory. *1887-1947: the surrounding land was farmed by patients for the production of fruit and vegetables for hospital use. Land reclaimed along Tarban Creek shoreline extended the arable area. *1928 map shows a large stables building to the south at the rear of the houe and the cow bails building alongside the kitchen. The Priory is labelled \\"The Dairy\\" on this map. The western verandah form varies from that on the 1885 survey plan and it appears a single storey pavilion of the Weaver extension may have been extended to the west. Little change occurred over the site in the early 20th century. Land below the Mission House was used as a golf course in the 1920s and 1930s, and the house istelsf used as the Ladies' Club House. The main evidence of occupancy of Gladesville Hospital - is the air raid shelter (near the vegetable gardens, later used as a garden storage shed) and an ablution block, built more recently and the only intrusive structure on site. 1950s changes included alterations to The Priory building; demolition of the Mission House in 1952, conversion of the cow shed into a store and cleaning room, following fires in 1954 and 1958; and removal of Salter's stone garden store in 1955. Plans of 1966 and 1967 show modifications made during the 1967 NSW Public Works Department maintenance program. Toilets to the rear of the pavilion of the Weaver wing were removed to convert the space to a boiler room and a tank and stand erected to the south. These have since been removed. A brick extension, with a clip-lock roof, was added to the south of the boiler room to provide a new shower and toilet facilities. This necessitated excavation and building the retaining wall to the west. Two of the windows in the rear wall of the Weaver pavilion were filled in and the third converted to a doorway to the new extension. Fire escape doors were inserted into window openings in the west wall of the Weaver wing and the south wall of the Salter wing, and metal stairs attached. These were later removed and the windows reconstructed. A commercial kitchen was installed () at the western end of the Salter wing. This required removal of walls, fireplaces, floors and joinery. The fitout of the kitchen was removed in a later upgrade of the house, and the servery between kitchen and dining room filled in and the surface re-finished. A building maintenance program in 1967 saw a number of modifications made: various alterations to front and rear verandahs, removal or blocking (up) of chimneys and repair and replacement of joinery. Internal finishes such as wall and ceiling plaster were changed. A timber-framed tank stand was built on the southern elevation (later removed) and there were excavations and rebuilding of retaining walls. The grounds were also altered in this period: earlier, in 1889, mud flats at Tarban Creek were filled to provide more agricultural land. This area was cultivated continuously until the 1950s. In 1957, approximately 100 tons of soil from the vegetable garden was removed to build a sports oval on the southern side of Victoria Road. The citrus orchard, possibly remaining in the Marist Brothers period, was buried by fill in the mid-1970s and 1980s. These extensive episodes of filling have altered the landscape of The Priory and Tarban Creek. More recently, The Priory had been a ward for patients who although rehabilitated, still required supervision. Nearby vegetable gardens still supplied the hospital and were tended by patients. In 1975 the Asylum area north of Victoria Road was renamed the Riverglade Hospital and given over to care for the developmentally-disabled. The Priory itself formally operated as patient accommodation until 1985, known as Ward 2. The last few patients moved out by the end of 1985. It was then occupied by NSW Government's Mental Health Review Tribunal offices and staff. Further repairs and alterations ahead of the new occupation included removal of ceilings and cornices to the Stubbs and Salter wings, removal of the whole roof slating to the Stubbs wing (in 1985), replacement of external doors with modern designs, replacement of door hardware and removal of original flagging to the northern (Stubbs wing) porch. 1981 drawings show planned changes to The Priory that don't appear to have been made. The west facade of the Weaver wing may have had additional openings previously. It is possible that NSW Public Works had documentary evidence at this time relating to a former balcony and rear openings, which it planned to reinstate. The lot boundary of The Priory was reduced in 1994 when subdivided by the State Government. The Priory on Lot 1 of DP823988 was retained in Government use and an area surrounding it to the north, east and south was sold into private ownership. The Priory continued use as offices until the Mental Health Review Tribunal vacated in 1/2003. In 2006 development approval was given for construction of town houses south-west of The Priory, on Lot 201 DP878383. Land immediately north and east of The Priory has been dedicated for use as public open space. The Health Department transferred their ownership of the site to the Department of Lands and on 1 November 2007 the then Minister Tony Kelly MLC, added The Priory and its surrounds to the Riverglade Reserve (R100263) Trust, administered by Hunters Hill Council.  Heritage listing  As at 11 March 2005, The Priory was a complex cultural landscape formed by the aesthetic and historic relationship of its harbourside location, the topography, natural and introduced vegetation, open space and a variety of buildings and structures. It has historic associations with early settlement, the advent of the Marist order in Australia and with mental health care for more than a century. The main building and site was the first permanent home of the Marist Fathers in Australia, their base for the South Pacific, and their first, purpose-built Procure house. It is integral to the history of the original Gladesville Asylum (later renamed) for over 100 years, and hence the history of psychiatric care in NSW. The main building (1847-1874, a Colonial Regency building) is a major landscape element, being a fine example of the colonial regency style of architecture, designed by William Weaver. In addition the site contains outbuildings, remnant structures and archaeological features that are heritage items in their own right, areas of natural vegetation and historic plantings, as well as evidence of the use of the building for farming purposes. The significance, meaning and interpretation of the building, outbuildings, archaeological sites and landscape are integral to one another.Extract of Heritage Office letter to NSW Health Dpt., 2004. The Priory was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 3 December 2004 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Priory and its curtilage were formerly part of two early land grants purchased by Thomas Stubbs from the Crown in the 1830s. It retains the major part of the original residence of Thomas Stubbs. The Priory was the first permanent home of the Marist Fathers in Australia, providing a base to their operations in the South Pacific and their first, purpose-built Procure house. The Marist Fathers have retained a nearby base in Hunters Hill to the present day. For well over 100 years the Priory has been integral to the history of the original Gladesville Asylum, later Gladesville Psychiatric Hospital - itself a significant site in the history and development of mental health care in New South Wales. The site provides rare evidence of its continued agricultural use, unusual in an area that is otherwise built up. The land was farmed first by Thomas Stubbs from the 1830s, and then by the Marist Order who extended vineyards and food production for their own consumption. For more than 60 years the area was farmed by patients for the production of fruit and vegetables for hospital use. The immediate grounds of the Priory contain an air raid shelter, a rare survivor of this underground facility from World War II. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The Priory has strong historical association with, and provides evidence of, the early settlement of Hunters Hill, reflected most directly in its location on one of the early land grants of the Municipality. The Priory has an association with the arrival of the Marist Fathers in Australia. During its period as \\"Villa Maria\\", a wooden chapel on the site was the original resting place of the body of St Peter Chanel, Proto-martyr of Oceania, following his martyrdom on the island of Futuna, in 1841. It was also the residence of Blessed Giovanni Mazzucconi on his arrival in the region in 1852 and again immediately before his martyrdom, by New Guinea Islanders, in 1855. These associations make the Priory a place of exceptional importance both for Australian Catholics and for Australians of Italian background. The Marist Fathers subsequently had an important influence on the development of Hunters Hill and religion in the colony and in the Pacific. The Priory has a strong association with the history of Gladesville Hospital and hence psychiatric care in New South Wales. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The aesthetic attraction of the Priory and its surrounding landscape is the combined product of topography, architectural variety, natural and exotic vegetation, open space and intimacy of the nearby water space and surrounding ridges. Vistas from within the area provide satisfying views of diverse characteristics - including natural bushland, landmark buildings, nineteenth century plantings and the Tarban Creek estuary and bridge. Vistas to the Priory from Hunters Hill provide rare, picturesque views of the building and its surrounding landscape within a suburban context. The Priory is a fine example of the colonial regency architectural style built in locally quarried sandstone. The main Priory building is an early and relatively intact example of the work of the important early Victorian architect, William Weaver. In addition to its integrity and quality in the Palladian style, the Priory is notable as a hybrid structure, successfully incorporating both the early farm cottage of Thomas Stubbs and the later picturesque structure added by Thomas Salter. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Priory and its surrounding landscape provide physical evidence of the establishment of the Marist Order in Australia. It has strong association with that order, as it was the headquarters for their Australian and Pacific operations. The Priory and its surrounding landscape provide important evidence of its association with the Gladesville Hospital, in particular, and mental health care, in general. The cessation of farming the area by patients marks an important change in attitudes to psychiatric hospital care in NSW. The Priory has contemporary significance for the Gladesville/Hunters Hill communities, who rallied in opposition to an earlier development proposal. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The immediate surrounding landscape contains a number of former outbuildings, structures and remnants with the potential to yield further information about how the site was used by each of its past occupants. These structures include former kitchen, stone terraces that define the garden layout, air raid shelter and footings to the \\"latrine\\" or garden building. The immediate surrounding landscape contains a number of archaeological sites (including cow bail site, stables, turning circle and road layout) all able to yield further information about the use of site past occupants. Evidence of original plantings exist in significant clumps of trees to the east, north and west of the Priory. These provide important information about the evolution/ and layout of the formal garden and surrounding landscape over time. Former outbuildings, archaeological sites and original plantings have value in interpreting the use of the Priory and the potential to yield information of wider relevance to history of NSW. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. As a site, building and landscape with so many layers of history still intact or able to be interpreted, the Priory is unique in its exemplification of the history of New South Wales and the settlement of Australia.

She is a Professor in Developmental and Molecular Biology, Anatomy and Structural Biology, and Medicine and co- director of the Institute for Aging Studies at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. She is best known for her research work on autophagy, the process by which cells recycle waste products, and its changes in aging and age-related diseases. Biography Cuervo was born in Barcelona, Spain on 14 July 1966. She studied medicine at the University of Valencia in 1986 and further pursued a PhD in biochemistry and molecular biology under the mentorship of Erwin Knecht, a biochemist studying lysosomes and proteosome at the time. In 1993, she published her first academic paper as a co-author on lysosomal degradation which challenged the assumption that it was non-specific. Cuervo also worked with Fred “Paulo” Dice of Tufts University on lysosomes during the summer months as Spanish labs were closed during this time of year. Cuervo later accepted a full-time post-doctorate position at Dice's laboratory and focused on understanding the lysosomal degradation pathway. In 1996 and 2000, Cuervo and Dice published their findings on this pathway, identified the lysosomal membrane protein LAMP2A as the receptor for this form of autophagy and termed it chaperone-mediated autophagy. In October 2001, Cuervo accepted a faculty position at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in The Bronx, New York. She continue primarily focusing on chaperone-mediated autophagy and its role in aging and human disease. Her research lab focused on protein translocations across lysosomal membranes, identifying regulator proteins like glial fibrillary acidic protein. In collaboration with neuroscientist David Sulzer of Columbia University Medical Center, she published evidence of altered chaperone-mediated autophagy in Parkinson's disease. Similar findings of disrupted autophagy was also reported when Huntington Disease was studied. Cuervo's research team also identified LRRK2, a protein enzyme that becomes mutated in Parkinson's disease, disrupts the process of translocation across lysosomal membranes. She is also co-director of the Einstein Institute for Aging Research and a member of the Einstein Liver Research Center and Cancer Center. She is also the Robert and Renée Belfer Chair for the Study of Neurodegenerative Diseases at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. In 2015 she was elected International Academic of the Royal Academy of Medicine of the Valencia Community and in 2017, member of the Real Academia de Ciencias Exactas, Fisicas y Naturales. In 2018, Cuervo was elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. She has also served as a member of the National Institute on Aging (NIA) Scientific Council, NIH Scientific Council of Councils, NIA Board of Scientific Counselors and in the Advisory Committee to the NIH Deputy Director. Dr. Cuervo is also one of the founding members of the Women in Autophagy (WIA) network dedicate to promote careers of young scientist interested in autophagy. Cuervo is co-editor-in-chief of the Aging Cell journal and serves in the editorial board of Cell Metabolism and Molecular Cell. She has been involved in more than 200 publications. Dr. Cuervo has been included in the 2018 Highly Cited Researchers List (ranking of top 1% cited researchers). Recognition Cuervo and her team have received numerous awards including the P. Benson Award, Keith Porter Fellow, Nathan Shock Memorial Award, Vincent Cristofalo Award in Aging, Bennett J. Cohen, Marshall Horwitz Prize and the Saul Korey Prize in Translational Medicine. She has delivered prominent lectures such as the Robert R. Konh, the NIH Director’s, the Roy Walford, the Feodor Lynen, the Margaret Pittman, the IUBMB, the David H. Murdoxk, the Gerry Aurbach and the SEBBM L’Oreal-UNESCO for Women in Science, and the Harvey Lecture. She also received twice the LaDonne Schulman Teaching Award . She was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2019. Personal life Cuervo speaks Spanish, and English. Cuervo's husband is Dr. Fernando Macian, an immunologist at Albert Einstein College of Medicine.

The river is 19 km long and drains parts of the eastern slopes of the Pirin mountain range. The river takes its source from Pirin's largest and deepest glacial lake, Popovo, at an altitude of 2,234 m. At an altitude of 2,174 m near the Fish Popovi Lakes it is joined by two mountain streams — one from the north sloping down the summit of Polezhan (2,851 m), and one from the west coming from the Polezhanski Lakes. Further downstream another stream coming from the Kremenski Lakes flows into the Retizhe. It then flows in north-eastern direction in a deep valley, forming rapids and small waterfalls. Downstream the valley becomes deeper and is covered with dense forests. Some four kilometres before its mouth the Retizhe turns in eastern direction and forms a deep impassable canyon. It flows into the Mesta at Momina Klisura Gorge at an altitude of 646 m near the village of Mesta, Bansko Municipality. The village is the only settlement along the course of the river. Its drainage basin covers a territory of 44 km² or 1.33% of Mesta's total. The main tributary is the Kremeshnitsa, which flows into the Retizhe close to its confluence with the Mesta. The river has predominantly snow-rain feed with high water in summer (June) and low water in winter (February). The average annual flow is 1.33 m3/s. Only a small part of the river's water resources are utilised for hydroelectricity. There are five small hydro power stations with a combined installed capacity of 10 MW. The river sustains large populations of brown trout.  Honours  Retizhe Cove in Antarctica is named after the river.

He is a current member of rock band Zabranjeno Pušenje and a former member of heavy metal band Divlje jagode.  Life and career  Orešković was born and raised in Slavonski Brod, SFR Yugoslavia (nowadays Croatia). At the age of six he went to his first music concert. It was the Bijelo Dugme concert, because his parents were their fans. Shortly thereafter, he had got an acoustic guitar and learned to play the first song \\"The House of the Rising Sun\\". By the end of elementary education, he started playing in his first rock band with whom he plays songs of the Rolling Stones and similar rock bands. In the following period, he played in various local bands, and in 1988, he became a member of the most popular local band Casablanca, at that time in a contract with Jugoton. At the beginning of the Croatian War of Independence he relocated to Munich, Germany. At that time, Orešković worked in a popular disco club where many popular bands and musicians from the former Yugoslavia were performing. He met with them, as well he worked with some of them, like with Dino Dvornik on his live album Live In München. In 1994, he returned to Croatia and settled in Zagreb. Invited by his longtime acquaintance Toni Lović, he became a member of band Hard Time where he played the bass guitar until 1997. In the same year, he joined Divlje jagode through audition. There, he performed on their ninth studio album Od neba do neba (2003). Orešković left the Jagode band in 2005. From the very beginning of his stay in Zagreb he has worked as a producer or co-producer of songs for musicians or bands such as Meritas, Vanna, Massimo, E.N.I., Žanamari, the Opća opasnost and many others. = Zabranjeno pušenje (2008–present) = Since 2008, he has been a member of the rock band Zabranjeno Pušenje.
