The team was able to compete in the group stages of the tournament with Dolphins United, Green Archers United, Loyola Meralco Sparks and Philippine Navy, but lost all of its games including a 33‚Äì0 defeat against Loyola. This is regarded as one of the most lopsided scores in the history of the United Football League (UFL) since it began a semi-professional league in 2009. History Blue Guards is one of three amateur guest football club that joined the 2013 UFL Cup, the other two are Bright Star and Manila Jeepney, some of their players are 40 years old and above featuring some of the members are their goalkeeper Samuel Letargo at 40 years of age, striker Noel Reyes at 48 and perhaps the Philippines' oldest active footballer Mindo Fajardo at the age of 80, also several other players have played for the national team during their times. This is the first time that a team that haven't played the third tier of Weekend Football League endeavor to join a top-flight competition like the UFL Cup. 2013 season In their first match, Green Archers United defeated Blue Guards in a 17‚Äì0 scoreline that formerly holds the record in most goals scored in the UFL before the match. It was then followed by another loss against Philippine Navy in a huge 10‚Äì0 defeat. On their third game, they faced Division 2 side Dolphins United with an 11‚Äì1 loss, this is the only game Blue Guards made a goal against their opponent. Blue Guards ended their run in the tournament at the bottom of the group standings with a ‚àí70 in goal difference in losing to all its matches in double digits. Loyola Meralco Sparks 33‚Äì0 Blue Guards defeat Last 30 October 2013, the Loyola Meralco Sparks and Blue Guards battled in the group stages of the 2013 UFL Cup Group E. The match was played at the Emperador Stadium, Fort Bonifacio, Taguig, Philippines. It surpassed the largest winning margin in international association football which is a 31‚Äì0 victory of Australia against American Samoa and three goals shy of a 36‚Äì0 win of Arbroath over Bon Accord. =Match summary= The match was started when Samuel Bonney scored a goal at the first minute. Then came in the next minute when Phil Younghusband scored his first goal of the game. Soon, after 15 minutes it is 6‚Äì0 for Loyola, goals by Matthew Hartmann, James Younghusband, his brother Phil and Robert Ca√±edo. At the eighteenth minute, Blue Guards got their first counterattack of the game, they breach the defense of Loyola to allow Roger Sulit to have a shot on goal, but it misses. The work continued by Lee Joo- Young and Matthew Hartmann enough to put their club by leading 15 goals. The team was able to hold the score in the last 15 minutes of the first half. In the second half, a tactical change happened for Blue Guards, they switched their formation into 8‚Äì1‚Äì1. But after two minutes, Matthew Hartmann scored the first goal of the half. Chad Gould subbed in the game and scored a goal from a free kick at the 48th minute. The scoreline reached 17‚Äì0. Gould scored 6 more goals, 3 goals each by Jake Morallo and James Younghusband, and 1 goal each by Simon Greatwich and Matthew Hartmann. Phil Younghusband finished the game by scoring in the 90th minute and in the final minute. Phil Younghusband scored 8 goals at the match which helped him to become the current scoring leader in the tournament at 18 goals, followed by Chad Gould at seven and five goals a piece to his brother James Younghusband and Matthew Hartmann. =Match reactions= Many criticize about the format on accepting new teams in the cup, and suggest there should be a screening will take place next year.

Enphase designs and manufactures software-driven home energy solutions that span solar generation, home energy storage and web-based monitoring and control. Enphase has shipped about twenty million solar microinverters, primarily into the residential and commercial markets in North America, Europe and Australia. Microinverters convert the direct current power from the solar panel (DC) directly into grid-compatible alternating current (AC) for use or export. Enphase was the first company to successfully commercialise the microinverter on a wide scale, and remains the market leader in their production.Eric Wesoff, \\"Enphase Dominates the PV Microinverter Channel: Where‚Äôs the Competition?\\", Greentech Media, 17 July 2013 History Enphase Energy pioneered the concept of a microinverter. The basic idea behind a microinverter is to convert, manage and monitor energy per panel, rather than the entire array of panels. This reduces the size of the inverter that can be placed on the back of the panel, producing an \\"AC panel\\". Such a system can be connected directly to the grid, or to each other to produce larger arrays. This contrasts with the traditional central inverter approach, where many panels are connected together in series on the DC-side and then run en- masse to a single larger inverter. In the aftermath of the 2001 Telecoms crash, Martin Fornage of Cerent Corporation was looking for new projects. When he saw the low performance of the string inverter for the solar array on his ranch, he partnered with another Cerent engineer, Raghu Belur, and they formed PVI Solutions. The two tapped Paul Nahi to be CEO at the end of 2006, and Fornage, Belur and Nahi formed Enphase Energy, Inc. in early 2007. Thereafter, the first prototype microinverter was developed. With approximately $6 million in private equity by 2008, Enphase released its first product, the M175, to moderate success. Their 2nd generation product, 2009's M190, was far more successful, with sales of about 400,000 units in 2009 and early 2010. Enphase quickly grew to 13% marketshare for residential systems by mid-2010, aiming for 20% by year-end.Kerry Dolan, \\"Enphase's Rooftop Solar Revolution\\", Forbes, 21 October 2010 They shipped their 500,000th inverter in early 2011, and their 1,000,000th in September of the same year.\\"Journey to the 1,000,000th Microinverter\\" The 3rd generation M215 was released in the summer of 2011,\\"Enphase Energy Launches 215-Series Microinverter\\", BusinessWire, 6 June 2011 and had sold over a million of all models in 2011, bringing their installed base to 1.55 million inverters and 34.4% market share.Eric Wesoff, \\"Enphase S-1 Update: PV Microinverter Sales Soar\\", Greentech Media, 25 February 2012 A 4th generation, the M250, was released in 2013. , their inverters captured 53.5% market share for residential installations in the US, which represents 72% of the entire world micro-inverter market.\\"Solar Microinverter Shipments to Quadruple and Reach 2.1 Gigawatts in 2017\\", IHS Electronics and Media, 27 August 2013 This makes them the sixth largest inverter manufacturer, of any kind, worldwide.\\"PV Inverter Supplier Base Fragments in 2012\\", IHS Electronics and Media, 2 May 2013 Enphase has experimented with the European market starting in France and offering sales in France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Italy.Jeff St. John, \\"Microinverter Wars: Enecsys and Enphase Go Trans-Atlantic\\", Greentech Media, 6 December 2011 However, they had considerably more success in the UK, and later, Australia. , approximately 20% of their sales is outside North America.Loralee Stevens, \\"Enphase Energy continues momentum\\", North Bay Business Journal, 2 September 2013 In 2012 and 2013, Enphase experienced increasing pricing pressure due to rapidly falling prices in the inverter market. Market leaders faced market share erosion in the face of newer companies, most of them from the far east.Tildy Bayar,\\"Solar Photovoltaic Inverter Prices to Fall Due to Fierce Global Competition\\", REWorld, 1 August 2013 However, in 2019, Enphase remains the leading supplier of solar microinverters globally. Products An Enphase M190 mounted and grounded. All Enphase microinverters are completely self contained power converters. In the case of a rooftop PV inverter, the unit will convert DC from a single solar panel into grid-compliant AC power, following the maximum power point of the panel. Since the \\"S\\" series microinverters (e.g. S280) all Enphase microinverters have been both Advanced Grid Function and Bidirectional power capable. This allows a microinverter to produce power in the DC-AC direction, for solar applications, or in the DC-AC and AC-DC directions, for battery use. The microinverter(s) in the Enphase battery products are exactly the same units as installed on the roof, with only software settings changed.  Legacy Products  The M175 was their first product, released in 2008. It was designed to output 175 Watts of AC power, but is capable of up to 5% over that. The M175 was packaged in a relatively large cast aluminum box, similar to the boxes used on cable tv amplifiers seen on telephone poles. Wiring was passed through the case using compression fittings and the inverters connected to each other using a twist-lock connection. A limited number of M210 models, based on the same generation system, were also available for a limited time. Due to a high level of failures the M175 was recalled and replaced by the M190 in 2009. The M190 offers a slightly higher power rating of 190 Watts (peaking to 199). The system was packaged in a much smaller case, this time filled with epoxy potting material to handle heat dissipation, and built-in cable connections replacing the earlier compression fittings. The system was otherwise similar, using the same connectors and cabling as the M175, and the two designs could be mixed in a string. Like its predecessor the M175 the M190 has also been plagued by a high failure rate. Around the same time the company also released the D380, which was essentially two M190's in a single larger case. For small inverters like the M190, the case and its assembly represented a significant portion of the total cost of production, so by placing two in a single box that cost is spread out. The D380 also introduced a new inter- inverter cabling system based on a \\"drop cable\\" system. This placed a single connector on a short cable on the inverter, and used a separate cable with either one or three connectors on it. Arrays were constructed by linking together up to three D380s with a single drop cable, and then connecting them to other drop cables using larger twist-fit connectors. In 2011 the entire lineup was replaced with the 3rd generation M215, combining the features of the M190 and D380 while improving reliability. Like the M190, the M215 was a single inverter, now in a much smaller box. Like the D380, the M215 used a trunk cabling system with short connector cables on the inverters. However, instead of one or three-drop cable, the M215's Engage system, used a long roll of cables with connectors spliced into it. The installer cuts the Engage cable to the required length, and then caps the open ends that result. In 2013 the M250 was released, offering a new grounding system (Integrated Ground - IG) that eliminates the otherwise NEC - required external grounding conductor, increased reliability, and increased efficiency (96.5%), along with a rating bump to 250W. Whereas previous models were all named after the maximum power rating, the M250 actually refers to its peak power. Using the same convention the M190 would be called the M199. The M250 is otherwise identical to the earlier M215 (which also was upgraded with IG) and compatible with the same Engage cabling system. All Enphase models use power line communications to pass monitoring data between the inverters and the Envoy communications gateway. The Envoy stores daily performance data for up to a year, and, when available, allows Enphase's Enlighten web service to download data approximately every 15 minutes. Customers and installers can review the data on the Enlighten web site.  Current Products  In 2015 the company launched its fifth generation of products. The S230 and S280 microinverters have the highest efficiency for module-level power electronics at 97%, offer advanced grid functionality like reactive power control, and comply with regulatory requirements like Electric Rule 21 in California and Rule 14H in Hawaii. The next-gen Envoy-S offers revenue-grade metering of solar production, consumption monitoring, and integrated Wi-Fi. The company also moved into home energy storage with its Storage System featuring an AC Battery, a modular, 1.2kWh lithium-iron phosphate offering aimed at residential users that is part of a Home Energy Solution. The Home Energy Solution launched in Australia in mid-2016. 2017 began the introduction of the new IQ architecture, which uses a new cabling system. Two conductors, down from four, are integrated and compliant with electrical codes due to the use of GFCI, no need for a neutral and no conductive materials in the enclosure. The initial products were the IQ6 and IQ6+, followed in 2018 by the IQ7. In 2019 the IQ8 series will enable continuous power production during grid outages during daytime without the need for batteries. https://enphase.com/en-us/support/gettingstarted/design References External links  * Category:Photovoltaics manufacturers Category:Companies listed on NASDAQ Category:Solar energy companies of the United States Category:Solar energy in California Category:Manufacturing companies based in California Category:Technology companies based in the San Francisco Bay Area Category:Energy companies established in 2006 Category:2006 establishments in California Category:American companies established in 2006 Category:Renewable resource companies established in 2006 Category:Companies based in Sonoma County, California Category:Fremont, California Category:Energy in the San Francisco Bay Area Category:Inverters Category:2012 initial public offerings ","title":"Enphase Energy"},{"id":"41089849","text":"John \\"Jack\\" Dunne (1890‚Äì1974) was an Irish footballer who made 23 appearances in the Football League playing for Lincoln City as a full back.

Das zabaano mein ganay vala gulokaar\\" by Amjad Aziz Malik, page 89-92 Unlike other Pashtun performers of his time, Akif adopted an exuberant and expressive style on stage, which led to him being labelled a \\"game changer\\" of the Pashto music scene. Due to the romantic nature of his lyrics he was considered a heartthrob and built a large female following. His energetic engagement with audiences broke Pashtun music traditions and often caused mayhem and mass hysteria. Recognised for his exceptionally deep voice, Akif has been credited for altering the face of conventional Pashto folk music. His musical influences include K.L. Saigal, Pankaj Mullick, Jagmohan, C.H. Atma and Mukesh. Akif overcame resistance by traditionalists of his era and is amongst the most distinct artists to have risen from the Pashto music industry. Early and personal life Akif was born in Kohat, Pakistan in 1947. Born Fazal-e-Malik, he added the pen name \\"Akif\\" in 1971 when he came across the word in Islamic literature. Akif derives from the word \\"I'tikaf\\", loosely translated as \\"someone who cannot be moved\\". His father Fazal Karim Asif was a prominent lawyer and mother Zubaida Khanum was a housewife. Akif is the third of seven siblings and describes himself as a \\"misfit\\" growing up. But he always maintained a close relationship with his father, a highly academic man and descendant of the Kamboh (Zubairi) tribe. Akif's father studied Law at the renowned Aligarh Muslim University in Uttar Pradesh, India and represented elite clientele across India and Pakistan. During his youth, Akif's father was an avid political activist, arrested and jailed on several occasions for picketing against alcohol distribution in the country. Akif's father was also a senior member of Muhammad Ali Jinnah's Muslim League party and is documented in the publication, \\"Quaid-e-Azam aur Sarhad\\" or \\"Quaid-e-Azam and his land\\" for playing an integral role in the independence of Pakistan in 1947. As a child, Akif was heavily influenced by his father's intellectual reputation and completed a Law degree at Peshawar University to fulfill his father's wishes. However, he never possessed a passion for the subject and regularly got into altercations with his university professors over the ethics of man-made law. After completing his degree, Akif handed the certificate to his father and declared his intention to continue his music career. However, upon his father's strict insistence, Akif put his plans on hold and worked as a lawyer, notary public and oath commissioner for several years. Akif struggled with his conscience when taking on cases he did not believe in and often lost out on fees by referring clients to colleagues or competitor law firms. Throughout his time studying and practising Law, Akif's love for performing arts never escaped him, and he eventually dropped the profession to pursue a career in music full-time. Akif's father died in 1985 and his mother in 2008. Akif had a love marriage to one of his fans, Sirat Malik (died 2004) from Rawalpindi, Pakistan. Sirat, who did not speak nor understand Pashto, wrote to Akif after seeing him perform on television. While touring the Punjab region of Pakistan, Akif visited Sirat's workplace to surprise her. They fell in love, married and have two children, a son Mohammad Ali Khan and a daughter Namsi Namoos Khan. Career=Early work: 1964‚Äì1969 Akif's first stage performance was at high school. Known to be an aloof, angry and introverted young man who kept himself to himself, Akif only agreed to perform on the insistence of his head- teacher who had identified Akif's talent for performing arts. Akif agreed to sing on the condition that he remained behind the stage curtains and did not have to face the audience. He nervously performed with his eyes closed and finished his performance to see a standing ovation and the curtains lifted. The audience's positive reaction encouraged Akif to continue performing. Akif made his official singing debut in 1964 on Peshawar Radio Station on a programme titled, \\"University Magazine\\". By now, Akif had gained popularity for his confident delivery of several stage performances in college and was selected alongside other talented students for the radio show. He travelled from Kohat to Peshawar to attend the two-day competition. Akif's primary passion was acting and he had prepared a drama skit as his audition piece. However, the radio station producers encouraged Akif to sing a classical Urdu song instead. With no preparation, Akif chose to perform \\"Na Hui Gar Mere Marne Se Tasalli\\" a complicated ghazal by Mirza Ghalib, originally sung by the Indian movie playback singer Mukesh. When Akif began to sing, the radio producers were taken by the quality of the teen's untrained voice, and selected him for both the drama and singing segments of the competition. Soon Akif was being introduced to music producers across Peshawar and was offered opportunities to sing on live radio. His first live Pashto performance was on Peshawar Radio Station in 1965, which led to him receiving offers from producers from across the province. As Hindko was his first language, Akif taught himself to read Pashto and often, due to time constraints, learnt songs verbatim by listening to them repeatedly. From 1964 to 1969 Akif performed regularly on Peshawar Radio Station and gained increasing popularity for re- inventing Ashraf Maftoon's songs with his own compositions. He gained much acclaim for his rendition of the sentimental ballad, \\"Zargay Mey Laywanai De\\", in which Akif slurred, hiccupped and sang like a drunkard, sniggering at the hopelessness of his lovelorn fate. By the end of 1969, television producers had caught on to Akif's growing fan base and he was invited to perform on television. Rise to stardom: 1970‚Äì1974 Akif performed on television for the first time on the talent show \\"Naye Funkaar\\" in Rawalpindi, Pakistan in September 1969. The show invited contestants from East Pakistan, now Bangladesh, and Pakistan to showcase their musical, singing, dancing and drama abilities in front of a panel of judges. Akif, still determined to pursue his passion for acting, had prepared a drama sketch as his audition piece. However, due to encouragement from Agha Nasir, the General manager of the television channel, Akif was put forward to also sing. Razia Sultana, a television producer and panel judge took Akif aside after his drama audition and encouraged him to sing in Pashto for the singing segment. Despite his apprehension he performed a rendition of the Pashto song \\"Turah Chay Tairaigy\\" and won first place in the competition. It was around this time Akif won the interest of renowned Pathan poet Ahmed Faraz. The two men forged a close friendship and regularly spent evenings together discussing their poetry and lyrics. Akif performing on Pakistan television in the 1970s In the years following, Akif went on to perform on various television shows including, \\"Aaghosh-e-Kohistan\\", loosely meaning \\"from the lap of the mountains\\", \\"Lok Tamasha\\", \\"Lok Mela\\", \\"Lok Virsa\\" and \\"Nandara\\". Akif represented North-West Frontier Province, now Khyber Pakthunkhwa, regularly alongside established artists from other provinces, performing often as the star attraction on Pakistan Television and other regional channels. Soon, Akif's fan base spilled across the border into Afghanistan, and his songs were granted increased radio airtime. Akif regularly travelled to Afghanistan to record songs on Radio Afghanistan in Kabul and to cater to the demand of his growing fan base. Here Akif met and produced songs with Qamar Gula's husband Mohammad Din Zakhil, a harmonium player and Gul Alam, a noted tabla player, who was also Nashenas's personal musician at the time. In 1974, a 27-year-old Akif was invited by Chaklala Television to sing alongside Naheed Akhtar, Tahira Syed and Roshan Ara Begum, three senior figures of the music industry, for the show \\"Mehfil\\". However, Akif was vehemently against performing duets and perceived such requests to be insults to his artistic individuality.Funkaar Naama, \\"Fazal Malik ka usool hai kay who doh gaana kabhi nahi gaatay\\", November 1978 He rejected producers' requests for him to sing with Tahira Syed, and instead sang a solo of Qateel Shifai's song, \\"Gungunati Si Koi Raat Bhi Aajati Hai\\". The producers reformatted the track as if Akif was serenading Tahira Syed. Known for his fiery temperament, Akif argued with the producers for not complying with his wishes and for falsely representing his version of the song. Akif's temperament Akif was known industry-wide for his angry disposition and principled nature. During a live television show in 1978 at \\"Lok Tamasha\\" in Shakarparian, Islamabad, Akif stopped mid-performance. Due to faulty technical equipment Akif was seen gesturing to Azhar Lodhi, the presenter and Tufail Niazi, the director that he was unable to hear the music properly. When they signalled for him to continue, Akif lost his temper, and in an act of rage kicked a prop stool into the air, threw his microphone to the ground and walked off stage. On another occasion in 1988, at a patriotic concert organised for Pakistan government's chief guests and ministers at Liaquat Memorial Hall, Rawalpindi, Akif refused to sing in a group behind lead singer, Shaukat Ali. He ignored the producer's instructions and left the venue from the back exit during the performance, resulting in a three-month ban from the music scene. However, this became a turning point in Akif's career as his comeback track \\"Zam Da Husn Jazeero Ta\\" went on to become one of his most successful releases. Akif was regularly banned from television throughout his career for submitting scathing interviews to publications with complaints about the music industry's lack of creativity and unwillingness to experiment. An established artist Although Akif was primarily a Pashto singer, he possessed wide crossover appeal and gained popularity in non-Pashto speaking regions of Pakistan. In 1982, music director and close friend, Sohail Rana of Shalimar Recording Company invited Akif to Karachi to produce an album in Urdu. On arrival, one of Akif's most notable performances was at the Ali Bhai Auditorium where Kamal Irani the presenter of the show lost control of the frenzied crowd and had to have the lights switched off so Akif could escape the building unscathed. Akif performed in various venues in Karachi, however, the opportunity to record an album never materialised. Despite Sohail Rana's persistence Akif refused to commit to an album, choosing instead to return to Kohat for the birth of his son, Mohammad Ali Khan. Akif's distinctive singing style had started to garner interest in India. So profound was his impact that according to an article published in the Frontier Post, \\"Frontier's Voice with a touch of Saigal\\" by Afzal Hussain Bokhari, Akif was a favourite of Bollywood film actor Raj Kapoor. When Kapoor came across Akif's audio cassette he was so impressed he likened Akif's voice to that of his close friend Mukesh, and insisted Akif be invited to Bombay as a vocalist for his future films. That same year, at a blood donation charity event organised by the Fatimid Foundation at Pearl Continental Hotel in Peshawar, Pakistan, guest of honour and film actor Dilip Kumar is said to have approached Akif after his performance. Kumar took Akif aside to compliment him for his energetic delivery and deep voice. As a fellow Pathan, he especially praised Akif for his bold representation of their people in the music industry. Mahjabeen In 1985, Akif and Ghulam Ali, who affectionately referred to Akif as \\"vakeel sahib\\" or \\"Mr. Lawyer\\", were asked to sing a set of private performances at the Marriott Hotel, Islamabad. Akif also performed alongside Mehdi Hassan and Farida Khanum at the annual Doctor's Association event in Peshawar, which was attended by the Pakistani film actor Mohammad Ali. He has also performed on shows along with Alamgir, Munni Begum, Akhlaq Ahmed, Tina Sani and Mahjabeen Qizilbash. In the late 1980s, Akif twice toured the Middle East including Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Sharjah and Qatar, alongside actresses and dancers Parveen Babi, Sonia and Rukhsana, as well as actors Badar Munir and Asif Khan, to showcase his music to a wider audience. At one particular performance in Dubai, his female back-up dancers gave such an impassioned performance that the wooden stage floor had to be mopped to clear the blood from their bare feet. To meet the growing demand from his female fans, Akif was regularly requested to attend private functions. At an event organised by the International Women's Association in Peshawar, Akif performed alongside Asad Amanat Ali Khan and Khyal Mohammad. When Akif took to the stage, the female audience broke into rapturous screams and applause, many of them standing on their seats in an attempt to gain Akif's attention. On leaving the venue Akif was swarmed by his female fans, several of them requesting his autograph on high value rupee notes with the promise of never spending them. Akif was regularly invited to judge local talent shows and particularly made appearances at school competitions to inspire young children. To this day Akif is impersonated in Pakistani talent competitions, with aspiring stars mimicking his signature voice and black beard. Voice Akif is known for his bass, thick and baritone voice. During his early years of performing on the radio, Akif was frequently mistaken to be a much older and heavier man. His female fan base grew following his performances on television, with hordes of women sending letters to local newspapers, radio stations and television channels requesting Akif's personal contact details and hand in marriage.Fortnightly Faasla (member of Audit Bureau of Circulations, London), \\"Aap kay paigham sitaron kay naam\\", page 48 Western recognition: 1990‚Äì1994 Fazal Malik Akif & Zarsanga with their band in March 1991 at Hackney Empire in London During a trip to Peshawar in 1990, Anne Hunt of World Circuit Records, came across Akif at a show at Nishtar Hall, Peshawar. Anne Hunt and Mary Farquharson, of what was then Arts Worldwide, were in search of musicians who were popular locally but little known to the wider western public. Hunt was seeking artists that encompassed musical excellence in their respective genres, and saw in Akif a global star relevant for the western music market. Hunt organised for Akif and his band, Walidad on tabla, Aman Shah on dholak, Musafir on harmonium and Amir Hamza on rubab, to travel to the United Kingdom as part of the \\"Jashan-e-Bahar\\" festival from the 7‚Äì21 March 1991, alongside other artists including Abida Parveen, Aziz Mian, Zarsanga, Allan Fakir and Farida Khanum.The Daily Jang London, \\"Jashan-e-Bahar\\", 9 & 10 March 1991, page 1-2 On arrival in the United Kingdom in March 1991, Akif performed with his band in various cities including venues in Hackney and Greenwich in London, Manchester and Birmingham. He was interviewed on BBC radio and TV Asia, and went on to perform on Channel 4 for the series Mahfil. Akif headlined along with Hangama and Farishta on 26 April 1992 for the Afghan Festival. He also regularly performed at charity concerts, including an event at Ganesh Hall, London in support of the Guyana Care centre. In April 1994, Akif was invited as the honorary guest to the launch of Safeer magazine. The event took place at Sanam restaurant in Manchester and was hosted by the magazine's chief editor, Mohammad Azhar. A review of Akif's future Eid show performance went on to feature in the magazine.Safeer Magazine, July‚ÄìSeptember 1994, page 85 On 22 October 1994, his 47th birthday, Akif headlined at the Gracie Fields Theatre in Rochdale, Lancashire as part of the North West Asian Talents Promotion event. This is believed to be one of Akif's final live performances. Akif & Abida Parveen in Manchester on 4 December 1994 Retirement Akif decided to remain in the United Kingdom with the intention of producing more musical material for his next album. However, his family circumstances forced him to retire from the music business. During his retirement Akif went on to host various radio programmes on Asian Sound and Kismat radio stations. Despite repeated requests for him to return to Pakistan, he decided not to return at the time and is remembered as having disappeared from the music industry at the peak of his career. Return to Pakistan: 2003 In 2003, Akif finally returned to Pakistan after a thirteen- year hiatus and was embraced by the music fraternity. Peshawar Television Centre produced a one-off comeback programme titled Yaad Girina where Akif spoke on his musical career and performed a series of his hit songs. The show was attended by an audience of old musical associates and friends, which included producers, directors, composers, performers and lyricists such as Mohammad Azam Azam. The programme ended with a 56-year-old Akif performing his famous song \\"Zam Da Husn Jazeero Ta\\" in a split screen format displaying him singing the same song years earlier at Nishtar Hall, Peshawar. Present Now residing in Manchester, Akif focuses on writing and painting. His two children have established a production company, which aims to promote a collection of his released and unreleased songs, along with an anthology of Akif's poetry. On 26 August 2016, Coke Studio uploaded a contemporary rendition of Akif's song \\"Dilruba Na Raazi\\" on their YouTube channel. Performed and further composed by Zeb Bangash, Faakhir Mehmood and Strings, the song is a huge hit and has garnered millions of views. Awards and nominations Akif was first nominated for the Pakistan Television Awards in 1986 in the category of \\"Outstanding Performance\\". He went on to win the 1987‚Äì1988 Khyber Award for \\"Best Singer\\" at a ceremony in Nishtar Hall, Peshawar. He was also nominated in three separate years for Pakistan Television's National Music Awards in the category of \\"Best Singer\\", once losing out to Abida Parveen. In 1987, Akif competed at \\"Lok Mela\\" in Islamabad, coming second to Pakistani gypsy folk singer Zarsanga. In the weeks ensuing Akif initiated legal action against \\"Lok Mela\\" for vote rigging. In response, Adam Nayyar, Executive Director of \\"Lok Virsa\\" replied acknowledging that Akif was indeed the best performer in terms of stage performance, public popularity and singing. Nayyar went on to invite Akif to sit on the UNESCO Advisory Board as a cultural ambassador, a position Akif declined out of principle. The Ministry of Culture of North-West Frontier Province recommended Akif for the \\"Pride of Performance\\" award for three consecutive years from 1988 to 1991. Discography cassette cover Akif sang hundreds of songs throughout his career and released some of his tracks on vinyl, as well as releasing EP's through EMI Pakistan Ltd. Recording Company in Pashto and Sindhi. Due to high demand from Akif's fans for an official album, in 1988 he released Zama Meena or My Love through Odeon Records in cassette format. The album was well received and embraced for its upbeat pop flavour and use of western instruments. Akif had little involvement with the production of the album and was unhappy with the sound quality and balancing of his voice upon its release. He put all his efforts into producing his next album, Baraan Wai Baraan (translated Rain Oh Rain), which was released in 1990 and became a commercial success.

It normally lives as a saprotrophic mold, but can also be an opportunistic pathogen known to cause pulmonary, CNS, rhinocerebral, or cutaneous infections in animals and humans with impaired immunity.Fungal Infections, Lichtheimia corymbifera. (2013). Retrieved from October 10, 2013 from the Leading International Fungal Education (LIFE) Web Site: http://www.life- worldwide.org/fungal-diseases/lichtheimia-corymbifera/. Appearance Lichtheimia corymbifera was originally described as Mucor corymbifer in 1884 by Lichtheim from clinical isolations in Wroc≈Çaw, Poland. At the time of the description, the species epithet, \\"corymbifer\\" was attributed to Cohn. In 1903, the fungus was transferred to the mucoralean genus Lichtheimia (honoring Lichtheim) by Jules Vuillemin as L. corymbifera. In 1912 the species was again transferred by Saccardo and Trotter to the genus Absidia as A. corymbifera where it remained for most of the 20th century. Alastruey-Izquierdo and colleagues in 1991 transferred the species to the genus Mycocladus, described originally by Beauverie in 1900. The type of Mycocladus has since been shown to be a co-culture with elements that appear to be conspecific with Absidia van Tieghem (1876). Thus the oldest available name for the fungus is Lichthemia corymbifera. Although conventionally treated in the family Mucoraceae, the erection of a new family to accommodate the genus Lichtheimia, the \\"Lichtheimiaceae\\", has been proposed. Lichtheimia corymbifera produces small, dark spores inside pear-shaped (pyriform) sporangia.Ransohoff. (November 26, 2010). Draft for 2010/2011 EOL University Species Pages Initiative by Katie Ransohoff. In https://mushroomobserver.org/name/show_name_description/1875?_js=on&_new=true. Retrieved November 9, 2013, from The Mushroom Observer. The species is characterized by a conically shaped columella and a short, pronounced projection, a funnel-shaped apophysis, on the top. The sporangiophores (sporangia-bearing stalks) are hyaline to slightly pigmented, sometimes branched, and arising from stolons in groups of three to seven. The zygospores are naked with equatorial rings, have opposed suspensors, and lack appendages. There is limited production of rhizoids, thus, it is often difficult to identify them without the assistance of a dissecting microscope. Lichtheimia corymbifera produces more compact, less effusive growth than L. ramosa. As well, the sporangiospores of L. corymbifera are ellipsodial and hyaline when mature, versus those of L. ramosa which are lightly colored and ellipsodial. Ecology Originally described in Central Europe, the fungus has been found in the Middle East, Great Britain, North and South America, India, and Africa. It is usually found inhabiting soil or dead plant material, and in association with farm animals, such as cattle and horses, probably because it decomposes hay and grass. Infections in farm animals can cause death relatively quickly if not treated immediately. The fungus was described as a cause of mycotic abortion in cattle in Po Valley, Italy. The natural environment for L. corymbifera appears to be soil and decaying grasses, with an optimal pH between 3.0-8.0. In addition, it has an optimal soil depth of 30‚Äì40 cm, according to a study in India. However, they can also be found in the air or underground and can survive on humans and animals, giving it its infectious quality. Furthermore, L. corymbifera can survive well in humid environments, for example, in swamps, dung, grasslands or sewage, in cotton, grains and straw as well. Lichtheimia corymbifera has optimal growth at human body temperature, 35-37 ¬∞C; however, due to its thermophilic nature, it can tolerate temperatures up to 50 ¬∞C. Lichthemia corymbifera is a fast-growing species in both culture and in vivo. In culture, the fungus is pale white at first and turns grey with age; the colonies are observed to reach up to 15 mm in thickness.Fungal Infections, Lichtheimia corymbifera. (2013). Retrieved from October 10, 2013 from the Leading International Fungal Education (LIFE) Web Site: http://www.life-worldwide.org/fungal-diseases/lichtheimia- corymbifera/ The fungus can also be cultured on a range of other materials including bread. Epidemiology Lichtheimia corymbifera accounts for approximately 5% of mucormycoses today, but true prevalence is unclear because the disease is not generally reportable and the diagnosis of mucormycosis is often empirical or based on the recovery of any zygomycetous fungus. Infection can occur in people with normal immune systems but contraction is rare if the person is merely in contact with infected soil. On the other hand, infection is common in individuals with weakened immune systems due to diseases like HIV/AIDS. A 100% mortality rate has been reported for individuals with HIV/AIDS who become infected with L. corymbifera. Other immunodeficiency diseases that predispose to infection are diabetes, blood cancers like leukemia or large skin wounds such as those secondary to burn injury. In patients with leukemia, the mortality rate is 1%. In humans, mucormycosis caused by L. corymbifera typically involves deep infection of the rhinocerebral and bronchorespiratory tract. The most common presentation in farm animals is mycotic abortion.Lichtheimia corymbifera. (2013). Retrieved October 15, 2013, from The University of Adelaide, Mycology Online Web Site: Infection is promoted in immunosuppressed organisms through spore inhalation or direct contact of L. corymbifera spores with tissues. Upon infection, the fungus invades the blood vessels and there is nearby tissue destruction or blood clot formation. Symptoms can be seen in various organ systems. For example, if the abdomen is infected, diagnosis is difficult since it is similar to an abscess presentation. Hence, diagnosis is often only made at death. Diagnosis is also difficult if the lungs are infected. X-rays are often inconclusive in differentiating between other infections. If the sinus/craniofacial area is infected, symptoms begin with facial pain, progressing to muscle or nerve impairment in the eye area, and ultimately leading to the formation of blood clots in arteries serving the brain. Treatment Treatment involves a combination of surgical debridement and antifungal therapy. Lichtheimia corymbifera is most susceptible to the antifungal drug Amphotericin B and Posaconazole, however, negative side effects are possible. These side effects can be relatively mild, resulting in chills and muscle pain but can also include severe forms of nephrotoxicity. Amphotericin B binds to ergosterol, found in fungal cell membranes. This causes ion and sugar leakage progressing to cell death. This species is variably susceptible to Itraconazole and highly resistant to Fluconazole, Ketoconazole, Voriconazole and Echinocandins.Fungal Infections, Lichtheimia corymbifera. (2013). Retrieved from October 10, 2013 from the Leading International Fungal Education (LIFE) Web Site: http://www.life- worldwide.org/fungal-diseases/lichtheimia-corymbifera/ Higher doses must be administered for these antifungal drugs to be effective. Other species of Lichtheimia are morphologically and genetically distinct but share highly similar antifungal drug susceptibilities.

The school operates under the Algonquin and Lakeshore Catholic District School Board, and teaches students the Ontario Secondary School Diploma Curriculum as well as curriculum from the International Baccalaureate Programme. Nicholson Catholic College is named after Monsignor J.F. Nicholson, a priest at the local St. Michael's Church Parish. The school takes an egalitarian approach to all students with differing spectrums of cognitive abilities. The school requires students to wear uniforms, and it is also one of the only schools in the immediate area to offer IB World Education services. History Nicholson Catholic College first opened in September, 1960, when it replaced the previous St. Michael's High-School which had been in existence since 1930. In 1960, Nicholson consisted of grades 11, 12, and 13. In 1965, Nicholson was expanded to include grades 9 and 10, when the Belleville Separate School Board opened Nicholson Senior School adjacent to Nicholson Catholic College. This new school addition also included a new and improved gymnasium, as well as 8 fully equipped classrooms. Nicholson Catholic College was the only Catholic School in the Quinte region for many years after its founding. However, because students from all the surrounding area who were enrolled in the ALCDSB had only the choice to attend Nicholson, this meant that by the early 1990s Nicholson was far over its student capacity. To solve this problem, the school board planned the construction of two additional schools (St. Paul's and St. Theresa's Catholic Secondary School's) in the Bay of Quinte Region to facilitate students who were outside of the Nicholson C.S.S. bus zone. Because of this transfer of students, the enrollment numbers for students at Nicholson dropped significantly in the late 1990s from almost 1,000 to around the current number of 600 students. Administration There are currently over 50 staff members at Nicholson Catholic College. The leader of the administration is the principal, followed by the vice principal. The administration generally operates with managerial elements and according to rigid policies set out by itself, the school board and the Ontario government. Students are not allowed to go against policy and have generally limited power to legally combat policies and the will of the administration, yet teachers have slightly more clout through unions such as OECTA. Students, parents and staff who have concerns about the administration can voice their opinions to the Algonquin and Lakeshore Catholic District School Board at board meetings, visiting the board office at 151 Dairy Avenue, Greater Napanee or by contacting the board by phone, fax or email (contact information available at www.alcdsb.on.ca). Student views on the administration vary with subjectivity playing a large role in their opinions. The closeness of the Catholic school community gives opportunity for the administration to communicate with students at events such as school mass and liturgies, fun events, and through student participation in athletics and extracurricular activities. Academics=General Academics Nicholson offers extensive transition supports to new students including a formal peer mentor program, shadow day experiences, dances for students in Grades 7 and 8 and focused Guidance support within both elementary and secondary environments. The school offers all courses that constitute the Ontario Secondary School Diploma curriculum as well as that of the IB Program. Students who attend Nicholson Catholic College are taught under the Ontario Secondary School Diploma, or the IB World Education curriculum if they are enrolled in the program. From 2008 and onward Nicholson Catholic College has maintained a consistent school overall ranking of between 6.9 and 7.4 out of 10. The gender gap between both males and females in mathematics has been about equal in the same timeframe since 2008 with a slight change from year to year, although the same gap between males and females has been much more skewed towards female students for the Ontario Secondary School Literacy Test every year but 2012. However, despite the unequal success rates between male and female students, Nicholson's OSSLT results still exceeded the provincial norm by 10% in 2012. Experiential Education Opportunities Nicholson Catholic College offers a broad range of Experiential Education Opportunities. Students at Nicholson can earn credits through experiential experiences called Co-op. Students will explore occupations and career interests through participation in real workplace experiences. Co-op education is an important element of the Specialist High Skills Major (SHSM) or Ontario Youth Apprenticeship Program (OYAP) training. Nicholson offers three Specialist High Skills Major (SHSM) opportunities: * Health and Wellness * Transportation * Communication Technology Apprenticeship is a method of training in which employers train workers to become skilled workers through on-the-job training and classroom instruction. The Ontario Youth Apprenticeship Program is for students who have career plans to become an apprentice in the skilled trades. During secondary school, students will begin the theory and hands-on-experience required for apprenticeship while completing high school credits. The hands-on experience is obtained through the co-op program. The Algonquin Lakeshore Technology Center (at Sir James Whitney School for the Deaf): The Algonquin Lakeshore School Board and Sir James Whitney School have formed a partnership in order to provide technological training for their students. Course offerings include Health and Personal Services, Hairstyling and Aesthetics, Transportation, Design, Manufacturing and Construction Technologies. These courses are offered off campus in two credit blocks. Nicholson is expanding the broad number of community partnerships to support experiential learning for students of all grade levels to build bridges to Apprenticeships, College programs and University programs The Life Long Learning Center (Eastern Campus ‚Äì Cobourg, Ontario): Students interested in the construction trades may apply for this program which prepares students who are interested in becoming a certified brick and stonemason, cement finisher or construction craft worker. After the five-week pre- apprenticeship program students are placed in the field of their choice and embark on their apprenticeship journey. Dual Credit: School + College + Work: The Dual Credit Program provides secondary school student with the opportunity to earn up to 4 dual credits by participating in apprenticeship training and College courses. While enrolled in college dual credits you will earn both high school and college credit s for successfully completing a course at the college. International Students Nicholson Catholic College accepts over twenty-five international students who come from Asia, Germany, Mexico, and South America to enroll in the Ontario secondary school curriculum. These students stay with families in the community for the duration of their stay, which is usually no longer than one school year, although some choose to pursue Canadian post-secondary opportunities such as University or College. It is the purpose of the international student program that students from different countries will learn about culture, faith, and values in Canadian society. It is also hoped that the students in the school community who permanently reside in Canada will gain a genuine understanding and appreciation for different cultures through interaction with the exchange students. IB School At Nicholson, students have the option of taking either the full IB diploma program or select courses in what is known as an IB certificate. Students work towards both the diploma and the certificate program in grades eleven and twelve. The school currently offers HL Biology, HL Chemistry, HL Visual Arts, HL English A1, SL French B, SL World Religions, and SL Mathematics. However, the school sometimes allows students to take online courses, such as SL Spanish ab initio and HL Mathematics, through Pamoja online education under special circumstances. HL Biology is taught as IB Group 4 subjects, and as IB Group 6 subjects, students can choose to take either HL Chemistry or HL Visual Arts. Catholic school=School Community Nicholson's school community also ties in with the values of Catholic Education, and is described on the school's website in full. Facilities Nicholson Catholic College has a wide variety of school facilities built to provide the schools curriculum to students. The purpose of facilities ranges from general subject classrooms to specialized science labs, as well as off-campus facilities that Nicholson students use for a wider range of skills training. Nicholson's current school facilities include: * Chapel, Library with computer lab * 2 Gyms * 4 science labs * Transportation Lab - housed off campus at Sir James Whitney * Cosmetology lab ‚Äì housed off campus at Sir James Whitney * Construction technology lab - housed off campus at Sir James Whitney * Hospitality and Tourism Program ‚Äì housed off campus at Sir James Whitney * Stage ‚Äì opens into main gym * Music room * Radio Station Studio * Closed Circuit Television Broadcast Room * Fitness Center * Lifeskills Center (program to age 21) * ALCVC: Virtual Campus * Visual Arts studio * International Baccalaureate Centre * Resource and Student Success Room * Enclosed student green space Extracurricular Activities=Athletics There are currently thirty teams that represent Nicholson in Bay of Quinte sanctioned sports. Men's and women's teams are presently running in: * Badminton * Basketball * Volleyball * Soccer * Skiing * Rugby * Swimming * Tennis * Hockey * Cross Country * Track & Field * Curling * Golf. Men's baseball, women's gymnastics and co-ed cheer leading are also available to Nicholson students. Nicholson Catholic College has also recently re- constructed the men's football team for the first time in several decades. To date, Nicholson teams have won over 130 Bay of Quinte Championships as well as 50 C.O.S.S.A. Championships. At the provincial level, Nicholson's athletic teams have captured numerous O.F.S.A.A. medals including: 3 gold, 2 silver and 2 bronze in gymnastics; 1 silver and 1 bronze in swimming; and 4 gold, 2 silver and 3 bronze in basketball. The school has also been very proud to host O.F.S.A.A. Championships in basketball (4), volleyball (1) and golf (1). Clubs and activities Nicholson Catholic College has many extra- curricular clubs and activities that do not involve athletics. Some examples of these clubs include, but are not limited to: the Games Club, the Travel Club, and the Badminton Club. Of special note is the Games Club at Nicholson, which is headed by a teacher who is the recipient of several nationwide modelling and painting awards. Involvement in any school or community activity at Nicholson will help students earn points towards one of the school letters. The School Letter Recognition Program attempts to encourage involvement and reward participation. =Student Council= The NCC Student Council consists of a group of student representatives elected by the student body. The Student Council is responsible for organizing school wide activities, as well as to represent and advocate for NCC students at school and board levels. NCC election processes involve an assembly where candidates present what they stand for and wish to do if elected, by means of a speech and/or a promotional video. The gathering together of students reinforces the concept of good democracy that promotes informed votes, and the element of a united Catholic school community. Student Council members attend regular meetings of the ALCDSB Student Senate to discuss board wide issues with Student Council members from each of the five high schools. Occasional Student Senate meetings are hosted at NCC, as Student Senate meetings are hosted alternately at each school apart from Student Trustee elections and other important events which are held at the board office. Special events=School Dances School dances are organized and run by the school's Student Council. Supervision is provided by staff members and police to ensure acceptable behavior. Each dance has a specific theme, which is voted on by students from a list of choices compiled by the Student Council. Oftentimes the music is provided by a hired DJ. School Mass Once a month students from all grades attend a worship service conducted at St. Michael's Catholic Church across the street from Nicholson. The mass is conducted by Father Richard Whalen, and the purpose is to encourage the student's spiritual development in the Catholic faith. Grade 9 Fun Day The Grade 9 Fun Day is held once a year to welcome all freshmen students to Nicholson Catholic College and to make them feel accepted into the school community. All Grade 9 students are divided up into teams which are all assigned a different color, and these teams participate in a wide variety of activities such as tug of war, bean bag tosses, and several other games. 'Civvies' Day 'Civvies' Day's at Nicholson Catholic College usually occur on the last Friday of a month, and are an exception to the school's uniform policy. During these days, students are encouraged to wear in whatever clothes they want as long as they are in keeping with good taste. School Spirit Days School Spirit Days are days where students can wear in clothing of their choice that is in line with a specific theme. These themes are usually decided upon by the student council, and these days generally occur as part of a 'spirit week', where every day is a different theme but which are widely related. Clothespin Game Held annually the Student council places the entire school population (staff and student alike) into brackets. In this contest participants receive a sheet of paper with an opponents name on it and a clothespin. The goal of the game is to pin the clothespin on your opponent before your opponent does the same to you or the window of time (usually a day or two) runs out. The loser must then sign the opponents sheet enabling the victor to proceed to the next round. If neither participant pins their opponent both are eliminated from the game. The game only takes place; during breaks and lunch periods, only on school property and washrooms are off limits. The game is taken very seriously by many people resulting in; modified clothespins, spying on enemies schedules, ambushes and intense 'duels'. In recent years the final two participants partake in a duel in front of the entire school (on the stage of the providence gym). Annual road race  Held annually in the spring, where students from all grades compete in a road race around the east end of Belleville near the school. The top female and male each year are awarded with their names on a plaque.

The hardy and evergreen plants may form a dense stand of shrubs, or grow to tree size. It is widespread and common in the interior regions of southern Africa, and occurs northward to the tropics. Though some are present near the South African south and east coasts, they generally occur at middle to high altitudes. It is readily recognizable from its much-branched structure and dull bluish foliage colour. Those bearing lanceolate leaves may however resemble the Wild olive, another common species of the interior plateaus. Range and habitat It is native to central South Africa (where one of 35 native ebony species), Lesotho, Swaziland, the Zimbabwean plateau and Eastern Highlands, Angola, Zambia, Malawi and uplands of tropical Africa. It is found in open or thick bush along stream banks, woodland, kloofs, hillsides, open forest, along forest margins and regularly in sheltered rocky places. It is rare in the lowveld where it is limited to rocky areas, or areas of higher rainfall. Habit It is a rounded, dense and bushy shrub or tree, reaching a height of 2 to 6 metres (rarely 8 to 20 metres), with a spreading, often symmetrical crown. It is slow-growing like its congeners, and becomes frost and drought resistant with age. In Zimbabwe it is a shrub of 1 to 2 m tall, forming small, dense colonies, or a small tree. Description=Bole and bark The bole is single or multi-stemmed and up to 30 cm in diameter. The wood is dark brown, hard and close-grained. The bark varies from grey to brown or blackish, and is smooth in young trees, but rougher in older trees. Foliage The plants carry a dense canopy of simple leaves of a dull grey- green colour and a rigid, leathery lineament. Variation in terms of colour, shape, texture and arrangement is however considerable. Foliage colour varies from a greyish green to distinctly blue, and the leaf shape varies from lanceolate to obovate. New branches and foliage are covered in rust-brown scales (gland granules), while mature leaves may be hairy or glabrous. Leaves may be opposite, sub-opposite or rarely alternate. The slender petiole is 1.5 to 2 mm long, and the leaves measure up to 5 x 1.5 cm. The leaf veins are clear and transparent against light, unlike the opaque venation of Wild olive trees. Leaves may also resemble those of the Natal guarri, a species of generally lower altitudes, but the latter's leaves have a finely hairy stalk. Flowers The fragrant flowers are produced in summer, from October to February. They are small, waxy, pendulous, yellow to greenish-white and borne in axillary pseudo-racemes, holding 3 to 10 flowers each. Their bell-shaped corollas are deeply lobed, and the ovaries are densely covered in bristles. Fruit The roundish, pea-sized berries (4 to 5 mm in diameter) are considered palatable when ripe. They are single-seeded and borne on female trees only. As they ripen, they turn from green to reddish brown, and eventually to black. They are somewhat or very hairy when green, but more or less glabrous when mature. Saplings can be grown quite easily from fresh, plump seed, that is sown soon after harvesting. Subspecies var. crispa *Range: very widely distributed in southern Africa *Description: leaves variable but hardly wavy, broadly tapering with rounded apex, or acute apex with rounded tip, margins entire, and generally smaller and narrower than the next var. ovata *Range: eastern karroid regions (incl. Cradock and Middelburg) to Northern Cape (incl. Kimberley and Kuruman) and southern Free State *Description: leaves wavy, much more ovate and sharply tapering, densely hairy when young, sometimes minutely scalloped, and hardly distinguishable from the Mountain guarri where they overlap Species interactions and uses Lichens often grow on older bark. Bees are attracted to the sweet scent of the summer flowers, and larvae of the moths Ectoedemia crispae and Graphiocephala barbitias feed on the leaves. The fruit are eaten by birds and mammals, including antelope, vervet monkeys, mongooses and rats, while the bark and leaves are browsed by Black rhino. A dye extracted from the roots is used for baskets, mats and wool. A medicinal infusion of the root is also used for various ailments, and the fruit or bark are used as a purgative.

It 'has been largely under pasture' since the Knights Templar left in 1308. Withham Preceptory, one of the smallest Knights Templar preceptories in England, was founded, before 1164, at Temple Hill, near South Witham, Lincolnshire, and was abandoned in the early 14th century. Founding and establishment Margaret Percy and Hubert de Rie were \\"great benefactors, if not founders\\" of the preceptory, which began as \\"a simple hall with outbuildings\\" before 1164. Development in the early 13th century led to a \\"regularly laid-out farmstead complex\\" comprising \\"two halls, a chapel, kitchens and agricultural and industrial buildings\\". The site, which has the River Witham at the base of the hill, and the river's source, half a mile distant, also included a water-mill, fishponds and \\"other water-control features\\". Chapel The rectangular chapel, constructed between 1200 and 1220, was unusual for a Knights Templar preceptory, as the Templars typically built distinctive rounded churches, to resemble the Church of the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem, a practice which \\"was unique in medieval England\\". Its size was around , with a stairwell in the northwest corner, that may have led to a bell tower. Two large footings, to the north of the altar, may be evidence of an Easter Sepulchre and a wall safe. During 20th-century excavations, burial remains were found within the chapel: to the south, a body that had once been in a wooden coffin, the coffin having disintegrated over time, and, to the north, a body in a stone coffin without a lid. A possibly corresponding stone coffin lid, dated to 1250, had been used, from around 1550, as part of a nearby footbridge over the River Witham, before being moved to the church of St John the Baptist at South Witham in 1905. Late 13th century In the late 13th century the hall and chapel were rebuilt, the farmstead complex was expanded and enclosed by a wall. The preceptory, at its largest, was: \\"Set about a great court, they had included a gatehouse on the north, a fine range of barns on the west, a domestic complex with hall, chambers, chapel and kitchen on the south-east, and a workshop area, with its ovens and kilns on the east.\\" In total, foundations for eighteen buildings have been located, ranging in size from 4 metres by 8 metres to 10 metres by 24 metres. Remains have also been found for what has been interpreted as a kitchen garden, and also a hall keep, 'intended as a place of refuge in times of crisis'. Disestablishment and Knights Hospitaller After the arrest of the Knights Templar in 1308, and the sequestering of their lands by the Crown, records show the preceptory was occupied by eight famuli, or farm servants, twelve ploughmen, a bailiff and three shepherds, all paid from nearby Temple Bruer. The Knights Templar order was formally disestablished by Pope Clement V, in 1312, and the Witham preceptory was completely abandoned by 1324. The lands passed to the Knights Hospitaller, who, in 1338, held a messuage (dwelling of some kind), eight carucates (units of ploughland) and moiety, in this case half the endowment, of the South Witham church, but are believed to have left the former preceptory uninhabited, and eventually incorporated the landholding into their estate at Temple Bruer. Later history In 1563, after the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the property, then known as 'Great Temple', was granted, by Elizabeth I, to Stephen Holford in 1562. It was then owned, with 'buildings as it stood', by Thomas, the son of William Wimberley, of South Witham, (originally of Lancashire), and remained with that family 'until 1761, or thereabouts'. The preceptory site, recorded as uninhabited in the late 18th century, along with the Wimberley's 'mansion, the post-house, and other lands', then passed to Lord William Manners, younger brother of John Manners, 3rd Duke of Rutland. From Manners, it went to a descendant, Lionel Tollemache, 8th Earl of Dysart, who held possession in the mid-1800s. Describing the preceptory in 1837, Thomas Moule wrote that the 'foundation of the building only remains, and they extend over several acres'. During the 1960s, archeological excavations commenced, which, as it had mainly been used for pasture, meant that 'post-medieval disturbance' had 'been minimal'. Items found during the digs included a gilded ring, knights head belt buckle, arrowheads and horseshoes. A second archeological excavation took place in the area, in April 2002, following preliminary work in December 2000. Evidence from the 11th to 15th century suggest large scale ironwork and bread-making in South Witham to supply local religious houses.

Renisha McBride crashed her car while intoxicated at a street in Detroit, and then walked to a neighborhood in Dearborn Heights where she knocked on the door of a house. The homeowner, Theodore Wafer, shot McBride with a shotgun. Wafer contended that the shooting was accidental and that he thought his home was being broken into after he heard her banging on his door at 4:42 in the morning. The shooting prompted some to claim her death was a result of racial profiling. Wafer was convicted of second-degree murder on August 7, 2014, and received a sentence of 17 to 32 years in prison. Shooting Shortly before 1:00 am on November 2, 2013, McBride crashed her car at Bramell and Majestic on the west side of Detroit. A 911 caller reported that a woman had been speeding down the street, struck a parked car, got out of the vehicle, and then left on foot. Police initially considered the incident a low priority, so no officers were immediately dispatched. Forty minutes later, another call was placed indicating that the driver had returned. EMS arrived on the scene, but McBride had again walked away from the scene and was not treated. The owner of the parked car, who encountered McBride and called 911, told police that McBride was \\"discombobulated\\" and appeared to be in a \\"confused state of not knowing where she was and not being able to give a phone number or anything.\\" Shortly before 4:42 am, McBride was shot by homeowner Theodore Paul Wafer, 54, on the porch of his Dearborn Heights home, more than three hours after she crashed her car about a mile away. Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy stated Wafer opened his front door and fired a shotgun blast through a screen door, hitting McBride in her head. It is unclear what McBride was doing during the three hours between the crash and the fatal shooting. Her family, however, states that she was looking for help after becoming disoriented by the crash, in which she may have sustained a head injury. Wafer initially stated to police that he thought his home was being broken into and that he had accidentally fired his 12-gauge shotgun. On November 15, 2013, the Wayne County's prosecutor office announced its decision to prosecute Wafer for second-degree murder, manslaughter, and possession of a firearm during commission of a felony. Wafer faced a maximum possible sentence of life imprisonment for the second-degree murder charge and 15 years for manslaughter, and an additional two years for the felony gun charge.Abbey-Lambertz, Kate. Trial Date Set For Theodore Wafer, Man Charged In Renisha McBride Shooting, Huffington Post, April 30, 2014. The trial began in June 2014. Wafer was found guilty of all three charges on August 7, 2014. On September 3, 2014, Wafer was sentenced to 17 to 32 years of prison. He received 15 to 30 years for second-degree murder, and a mandatory two-year sentence for the felony firearms charge.Foley, Aaron. State seeks 17 years for Michigan porch shooter, Yahoo News, August 28, 2014.Foley, Aaron. Tearful judge gives man 17 years for Michigan porch shooting, Reuters, September 3, 2014. Reaction McBride's death is one of several deaths of African-Americans protested by the Black Lives Matter movement. Comparisons have also been made to the September 14, 2013, shooting death of Jonathan Ferrell. Ferrell, who was African American, was shot 10 times and killed by a white police officer, Randall Kerrick. Like McBride, Ferrell had been involved in an automobile accident and may have been seeking assistance. He was allegedly running toward Kerrick when he was shot. Kerrick was charged with voluntary manslaughter. His trial ended in a hung jury and he was not retried.

The Lucky Stiff was produced by famous comedian Jack Benny, the only feature film he ever produced, through his production company, Amusement Enterprises. Plot Lawyer John Malone (Donlevy) is an ardent admirer of the sultry night-club singer Anna Marie St. Clair (Lamour). After meeting her at the club, he is present when her boss is killed, and she is arrested for the crime. Anna Marie is sentenced to death, so Malone and his secretary Maggie Seaton (Trevor) set out to find the real murderer, who is probably also responsible for a protection racket Malone is investigating. At the last possible moment, Anna Marie is saved from execution. When she learns that the newspapers have reported that she is dead, she decides to use her status as a \\"corpse\\" to her advantage. Millie Dale, her replacement at the nightclub, is also killed. Malone concludes that nightclub owner Eddie Britt has been behind the scheme all along but that Anna Marie, in love with Britt, was also complicit. Police inspector Von Flanagan ends up placing Anna Marie back under arrest, while Malone places a kiss on Maggie. Cast * Dorothy Lamour as Anna Marie St. Claire * Brian Donlevy as John J.

Work Shapiro's baccalaureate and graduate studies have dealt extensively with the history of vegetarianism and the animal rights movement. His first publication was an in- depth review of James Gregory's seminal \\"Of Victorians and Vegetarians: The Vegetarian Movement In Nineteenth-Century Britain\\". His forthcoming doctoral dissertation is titled \\"Bodies at War: Animals, The Freedom of Science, and National Security in the United States, 1899-1979\\" and will focus on the conflict between ethical concerns over animal rights and U.S. national security concerns. In addition to the dissertation, he is also developing a historical map of how the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has handled the animal rights movement. Both projects rely on large amounts of information that, while not necessarily classified, is usually only be made public once formally requested under the Freedom of Information Act.

Ryan is the brother of Paul Shapiro, former vice president of farm animal protection for the Humane Society of the United States. In 2005, Stephanie Bain answered a want-ad for a roommate posted by Ryan Shapiro. Although initially platonic, Shapiro would eventually propose to Bain at Ellwood Butterfly Preserve and Beach in Santa Barbara, five years after they first met. In 2011, the Shapiro married Stephenie Bain at Brookside Gardens. The reception was vegan and was covered in the \\"Vegan Weddings 2012\\" section of VegNews Magazine. Ryan and his wife live in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Activism Prior to his FOIA activism and his associated legal efforts, Ryan Shapiro was a leader in the movement to ban foie gras in the State of California. Shapiro, along with colleague Sarahjane Blum, produced the documentary \\"Delicacy of Despair: Behind the Closed Doors of the Foie Gras Industry\\" and created a website (www.gourmetcruelty.com), both of which expressly advocate for a ban on the production and consumption of foie gras. Through the film and website, as well as his support for anti-foie gras activists and protesters whose efforts included expos√©-style investigations of companies such as Hudson Valley Foie Gras in New York and Sonoma Foie Gras in California, Shapiro played an important role in generating support for the anti-foie gras movement that led to California successfully but controversially banning the product. (Hudson Valley Foie Gras is largely the subject of \\"Delicacy of Despair\\".) Litigation Ryan Shapiro's first lawsuit was directly related to his dissertation research. After in-depth study of FOIA regulations, Shapiro was able to determine that processing a request for information that names a specific individual, an investigation of a group that individual is affiliated with and includes a privacy waiver from that individual forces a response when provided to the FBI. Shapiro's technique initially worked and he began processing hundreds of FOIA requests formatted in that manner. After initial success, the FBI eventually refused to provide further information in a timely fashion. FOIA decisions are typically provided within 20 days from receipt of a request. The FBI told Ryan Shapiro that his requests would take seven years to review before he would be told if his request would be rejected. Shapiro decided to sue the FBI and retained the services of Jeffrey Light, a Washington, D.C. Appellate attorney with an extensive background in pro bono civil rights and FOIA cases. In court, the FBI claimed that due to the volume of requests that they were receiving from Shapiro, there was no way for them to effectively redact the content of released records. Because of the sheer number of requests, even heavily redacted records could be assembled to create a \\"mosaic\\", a complete view of the FBI's ongoing investigations into animal rights groups. Alongside other notable animal-rights activists, Ryan Shapiro was a co-plaintiff in the high- profile Federal lawsuit Blum v. Holder. Alexander Reinert of the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law and David Milton and Howard Friedman of Howard Friedman PC represented the plaintiffs. The case challenged the constitutionality of the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 43-2006 (also known as the AETA) which criminalizes certain forms of protest and other actions against animal-using enterprises and their employees that the law purports to be \\"acts of terrorism\\". Shapiro and the other plaintiffs argued the measures are draconian violations of First Amendment freedom of speech and freedom of the press protections. Department of Justice lawyers representing the defendant Eric Holder argue that because the plaintiffs were never prosecuted under the AETA, they failed to meet the standard of an \\"aggrieved party\\" that would grant them standing to bring the suit. The plaintiffs contended that as animal rights activists, their work depended upon their ability to speak freely about issues impacting animal rights, and that fear of prosecution under the AETA chilled their speech and as a result negatively impacted their ability to perform their work. The case was dismissed on March 12, 2013 after the presiding Judge Joseph L. Tauro sided with the defense and confirmed the plaintiffs lacked standing. Shapiro and the other parties to the suit acquired new representation from the Center for Constitutional Rights and appealed the decision, arguing their cases before Judges Lynch, Thompson and Kayatta. There was widespread support for the plaintiffs. An amicus brief was filed on their behalf by the New York State Bar Association that confirmed the original arguments in the case and also held that the terrorism provisions robbed AETA defendants of their Fifth Amendment rights to due process. The ACLU also filed an amicus brief, arguing that the terms used by the AETA are not properly defined and as a result the law is so vague it cannot be properly enforced. Despite the arguments, on March 7, 2014, the appellate court affirmed the case's original dismissal based on standing. The court's published opinion elaborated that the case brought by Shapiro and his colleagues was \\"based on speculation that the Government will enforce the Act\\" and that \\"such unsubstantiated and speculative fear is not a basis for standing.\\" Shapiro and investigative journalist Jason Leopold filed a joint lawsuit on July 26, 2013 against the FBI for ignoring their FOIA requests concerning a possible file on Michael Hastings, a Rolling Stone journalist who died in a fiery high-speed automobile crash on June 18, 2013 in Los Angeles, California. As the result of the lawsuit, the FBI publicly released 21 pages of internal documents it had compiled on Hastings on September 21, 2013. The documents are available directly through the FBI's website. None of the documents provided allude to Hastings as the target of an investigation, and the FBI claims that the documents represent all of their records on Hastings. In addition, Shapiro is the sole plaintiff of a lawsuit seeking for a Federal court to force the Department of Justice to comply with an FOIA request for documentation concerning a Federal Bureau of Investigation threat assessment of an alleged plot to assassinate Occupy Houston protesters. On March 12, 2014, the presiding Judge Rosemary M. Collyer of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia has ruled that, while the FBI may have a right to refuse some documents to Shapiro, the justification they have provided to the court is incorrect (in a series of briefs filed between June 16 and June 30, 2013, FBI FOIA chief David Hardy maintained that the documents are exempt from the FOIA because they were compiled for \\"law enforcement purposes\\"). As of March 23, 2014 the case remains before the court. In January 2014, Ryan Shapiro sued the Central Intelligence Agency after they failed to respond to a FOIA request he processed for documents related to Nelson Mandela. The request was processed in order to determine whether the US intelligence community played a role in Mandela's arrest and subsequent imprisonment by pro-Apartheid forces in South Africa. In addition to the CIA, the FBI, the National Security Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency also received FOIA requests from Shapiro. Every other agency responded to the request, although the NSA refused to admit the existence of any records pertaining to Mandela and the DIA responded without processing the request. In November 2016, Shapiro and Washington, DC- based FOIA specialist attorney, Jeffery Light, founded the non-profit transparency organization, Property of the People. One project of Property of the People, Operation 45, seeks transparency and accountability from the Trump/Pence administration. As of that month, Shapiro had 12 ongoing FOIA lawsuits against several U.S. government departments and agencies, including the FBI, CIA, IRS, National Security Agency, Defense Intelligence Agency, Department of Justice, Secret Service and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. He said he is \\"genuinely worried about the survival of FOIA itself as a tool under President Trump.\\" Shapiro told The Nation in February 2017 that Light and himself were working full-time on the project since the election of President Trump.

Patron Deity  MahƒÅbodhisattva K≈çen is venerated as the patron deity. K≈çen (ÁöáÂÜÜ) was a Tendai monk in the latter part of the Heian period. Since he was said to have died on June 13, 1169, it is assumed that he was born in 1074. K≈çen was born in Tsuji, Tamana- sh≈ç in Higo Province as a great-great-grandson of Kampaku Fujiwara no Michikane (Ëó§ÂéüÈÅìÂÖº). His father was Fujiwara no Shigekane (Ëó§ÂéüÈáçÂÖº), governor of Buzen Province. In his teens, he took the novice's ordination with K≈çgaku (ÁöáË¶ö), a master of Sugiu School (Ê§ôÁîüÊµÅ), at Mt. Hiei, and studied Exoteric Buddhism under him. He furthered his education by studying Esoteric Buddhism with J≈çen (ÊàêÂÜÜ). He started going by the name of K≈çen around this time by taking a Chinese character from each of his masters' names. He lived in Kudoku-in on Mt. Hiei and became known as the Acharya of Higo (ËÇ•ÂæåÈòøÈóçÊ¢®, Higo Ajari). H≈çnen who founded J≈çdo-sh≈´, a major school of Pure Land Buddhism, was ordained under K≈çen in his last years and became his disciple. He was also a noted scholar known for his erudition. He wrote Fus≈ç Ryakki (Êâ∂Ê°ëÁï•Ë®ò, A Concise History of Japan) which is considered Japan's first chronicle detailing the events (mainly related to Buddhism) from the reign of Emperor Jimmu to that of Emperor Horikawa in the chronological order. The actual circumstances of his death are unknown. According to the biographies of H≈çnen written in the latter part of the Kamakura period, on June 13, 1169, K≈çen commenced tantric practice in the form of a draconic deity in Sakuraga-ike Pond in Ensh≈´. Sakuraga Pond is an actual dammed lake in Omaezaki, Shizuoka Prefecture.

An English translation of the text is available.).  History = Foundation to Destruction  The Great Brahma Bell of Oku-no-in Five-ring Stupas, Municipal Cultural Properties of Tamana An excavated statuette Vairocana In the Middle Ages, a temple called J≈çk≈ç-ji stood on the site of the present Main Temple of Renge-in Tanj≈ç-ji. The Higo Chronicle written in the Edo period states that Taira no Shigemori ordered the construction of J≈çk≈ç-ji along with two five-ring stupas (‰∫îËº™Â°î), the Great South Gate, and a nunnery named My≈çsh≈ç-ji (Â¶ôÊÄßÂØ∫). Since Shigemori, who was the eldest son of Taira no Kiyomori, was born in 1138 and died in 1179, J≈çk≈ç-ji seems to have been built during the last decades of the Heian period. However, the statement in the Higo Chronicle cannot be supported by surviving contemporary documents. The oldest document which mentions J≈çk≈ç-ji is the T≈çmy≈ç-ji Document written in 1298 in the Kamakura period, in which it is stated that \\"J≈çk≈ç-ji of Higo Province was privately built by Shramana Ek≈´.\\" Although we cannot determine that the \\"J≈çk≈ç-ji of Higo Province\\" mentioned there is indeed the J≈çk≈ç-ji Renge-in of Taira no Shigemori mentioned in the Higo Chronicle or that the former succeeded the latter, it is safe to assume that J≈çk≈ç-ji was built either at the end of the Heian period or the beginning of the Kamakura period. An excavation in the 1960s at the site of the present Main Hall revealed several Buddhist instruments from the Kamakura period. Therefore, it is conjectured that the Main Hall of J≈çk≈ç-ji also once stood there or near the site. These objects, designated Municipal Cultural Properties of Tamana in 2008, are on exhibit at Renge-in Tanj≈ç-ji. According to the old documents of Saidai-ji from the Kamakura period and the Muromachi period, it is unquestionable that J≈çk≈ç-ji continued to exist from 1290 at least up to 1478. Since the temple no longer existed in the Edo period, it seems reasonable to suppose that it was destroyed during the wars of the Sengoku period. However, no document thus far has been discovered to corroborate this conjecture.  Restoration to Present  Bronze statue of Zeshin Kawahara Oku-no-in In the first years of the Sh≈çwa period, there were only a few houses, fields, and little woods scattered around on the former site of J≈çk≈ç-ji. These woods were believed by the locals to be haunted by a wrathful spirit, and, in 1929, Zeshin Kawahara, a psychic from the neighboring city of Arao, was sought out for his psychic abilities to appease the spirit. In the early morning of December 10, while reciting sutras in a shanty on the former site of J≈çk≈ç-ji, he heard a voice telling him \\"I am the Acharya K≈çen who, 760 years ago from now, was granted a draconic form at Sakuraga Pond in Ensh≈´. Now with my wishes being fulfilled, I grant thee the merit. Rebuild Renge-in for the sake of the salvation of all people.\\" Although Zeshin, who was 34 years old at the time, had never heard either of K≈çen or Sakuraga Pond, convinced of the gravity of the spiritual communication, he immediately commenced the restoration of the temple. Aided by the local villagers, a small Main Hall was completed by next March. In the following years, the Acharya Hall, the Dining Hall (È£üÂ†Ç), and the Visitors' Center were added. The temple thus restored was named Renge-in Tanj≈ç-ji (\\"Birth Temple\\") in honor of MahƒÅbodhisattva K≈çen's birthplace on which it stands. The small Main Hall was renovated into the Daigan-d≈ç (Â§ßÈ°òÂ†Ç) in 1950, which, in turn, was transformed to the present Main Hall of reinforced concrete in 1966. Thus Zeshin successfully fulfilled K≈çen's command; his psychic power as a Mahasiddha was further strengthened over the years due to his innate spiritual abilities and strenuous training, which he applied, under K≈çen's protection, for the salvation of the distressed. As the result, the number of devotees gradually increased all over the country. Upon Zeshin's passing in 1977, Shin-nyo Kawahara took over as abbot. November 3, 1978 saw the Opening Celebration of the Oku-no-in on Mt. Sh≈çdai, which had been under construction at the wish of the former abbot, making Renge-in more accessible not only to the devotees but also to all visitors. As a practitioner of Fuse- gy≈ç (Â∏ÉÊñΩË°å, Almsgiving Practice), he started to support Cambodian refugees. Based on this experience, he founded the nonprofit organization Association for Renge-in Tanj≈ç-ji International Cooperation (ARTIC for short), devoted to providing the needy all around the globe with humanitarian aids. He also founded the Committee for Raising Parent-caring Children, and advocated and encouraged a closer relationship between the parent and the child by inviting elementary and middle school students all over Japan to submit poems on their mothers.

Early years  Victor Channing Sanborn was born in Concord, Massachusetts to Louisa Leavitt and Franklin Benjamin Sanborn,Sanborn, V.C.Genealogy Of The Family Of Samborne Or Sanborn In England And America, 1194-1898 and was named in honor of the poet Ellery Channing.Clark, Tom Foran, The Significance of Being Frank: The Life and Times of Franklin Benjamin Sanborn He was prepared for college in the public schools of Concord, graduating from high school at the age of sixteen, but due to poor health was prevented from entering Harvard College as planned. In 1885, however, he spent a term as an unmatriculated student at Cornell University.  Professional life  On January 1, 1886, Victor Sanborn began office work in Omaha, Nebraska, for the Burlington & Missouri River Railroad under the auditor of freight and passenger account. After a few months he was promoted to the passenger department, and for two years served as secretary to P.S. Eustis, general passenger agent. In 1888, Eustis was transferred to Chicago to take charge of the passenger department of the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad, and Sanborn went with him as his secretary. Two years later, Victor Sanborn was promoted to assistant clerk, and two years after that to chief clerk. He resigned January 1, 1898, and engaged in the real estate business in Chicago, entering the office of Clarance A.

The Sanborn Genealogical Association was formed in 1853 for the purpose of compiling a family history. The Recording Secretary, Dr. Nathan Sanborn, first published his research in 1856 in the New England Historic Genealogical Register. This article, also published in pamphlet form, was one of the earliest American genealogies printed. Dr. Sanborn died in 1858 and his records were given to the SGA's President, Dyer H. Sanborn, who continued research and extensive correspondence until his death in 1871.The Sanborn Family Association, Sanborn Family Genealogy, Rootsweb, sanborn/pages/page6 V.C. Sanborn became interested in continuing this research. By the age of seventeen, Sanborn had searched the Hampton Falls and Exeter, New Hampshire records, laying the foundation for a book on the Samborne - Sanborn Genealogy in an article for The New England Historical and Genealogical Register of July 1885, when he was eighteen. The first edition of his book, The Genealogy of the Family of Samborne or Sanborn in England and America, 1194-1898, was published in 1887 when Sanborn was twenty years old, receiving favorable reviews from the beginning, including one in The Nation stating, \\"This is one of those stupendous volumes peculiar to this country, which are without a parallel elsewhere.\\" Sanborn's continued research and refinement of the Sanborn genealogical record took him to England and the European continent in 1895 and again in 1913, resulting in a source which remains foremost in the study of this family's history into the early twentieth century,see Sanborn Family Association, http://www.sandbornfamilyassociation.com and one of the best family genealogies in existence.

Personal life  On May 28, 1891, Sanborn married Louise Wilkinson Kirkland, daughter of author Joseph Kirkland and granddaughter of author Caroline Kirkland; they remained in the Chicago area, building a home in Kenilworth, Illinois in 1900. The couple volunteered actively in local concerns, Victor serving as President of the Village and President of the Kenilworth Club, and Louise as Kenilworth Historical Society President.Minutes of a Meeting of the Building Review Commission of Kenilworth, Wednesday, December 14, 2005.

Career Royden Lam is best known as a soft tip darts player but also plays steel tip darts. In 2009 he won the Hong Kong Open by beating Liu Cheng from China in the final. In 2010, he lost in the final of the Japan Open to Kyle Anderson and in the quarter-finals of the Asia Pacific Cup to Morihiro Hashimoto. In 2011, he almost managed to qualify for the PDC World Championship, but was defeated by Scott MacKenzie 4‚Äì3 in the final of the Chinese qualifier. In 2013, Lam registered for PDC Qualifying School and earned a Tour Card on the final day. However, he only played in three events during the year which included a 5‚Äì3 first round loss against Wayne Jones in the UK Open. Lam qualified for the 2014 World Championship by whitewashing Deng Yin 5‚Äì0 in the final of the Chinese qualifier. He beat world number 65 Gino Vos 4‚Äì1 in the preliminary round, before losing by three sets to one against Wes Newton in the first round. Lam made his debut in the World Cup of Darts in June as he represented Hong Kong with Scott MacKenzie. They defeated Norway 5‚Äì2 in the first round to face Australia in the second round. Lam lost his singles match against Simon Whitlock, before MacKenzie saw off Paul Nicholson to mean a doubles match was required to settle the tie, which Hong Kong were whitewashed in 4‚Äì0. In the 2015 World Cup, Lam and MacKenzie caused a couple of shocks. First they defeated Wales' Mark Webster and Jamie Lewis 5‚Äì3. Lam then beat Ireland's William O'Connor 4‚Äì1, but MacKenzie lost 4‚Äì3 to Connie Finnan meaning a doubles match was needed to settle the tie which Hong Kong won 4‚Äì3 to reach the quarter-finals. However, the Scottish number two seeds of Gary Anderson and Peter Wright proved a step too far as they won both their singles matches 4‚Äì2 to eliminate Hong Kong. In the 2016 World Cup, the Hong Kong pair lost to Ireland 5‚Äì4 in the first round. Lam won the Malaysian Open by beating Mark Jumin in the final and the same opponent defeated him in the semi-finals of the South Asian Qualifier for the 2017 World Championship. Lam claimed a two-year PDC Tour Card for 2017 and 2018 when he beat Jos√© Oliveira de Sousa 5‚Äì2 in the last round on the second day of Q School and said he would continue to play a mix of events in Asia and Britain.

His other notable interviews were with Mullah Omar, the leader of the Afghan Taliban movement who controlled Afghanistan from 1994 to 2001 before they were driven out by American and allied forces. Pasarly has interviewed the secretive one-eyed leader Mullah Omar three times by phone in four- or five-minute conversations that were recorded on the spot without prior arrangement. The last such conversation took place late in 2001, after US B-52 bombers had started pounding Taliban- controlled areas. Pasarly later told an Aljazeera reporter about his experience of interviewing Mullah Omar. \\"The impression I was left with is that he either does not understand the nuances of issues, or that he is too smart and does not want to give clues on his inner thoughts\\". Writing Pasarly also writes fiction in Pashto; he is the author of several books including two novels, four collections of short stories, a collection of plays and one non-fiction book about online journalism.

He is Reader Emeritus in Economics at the University of Oxford and Emeritus Fellow of St Antony's College, Oxford, and formerly a Fellow of Templeton College, Oxford. He is also Honorary Professor in the School of Social Sciences at the University of Birmingham. Retrieved 11 October 2013 In a trio of books published between 1965 and 1970 Kaser presented a detailed picture of the workings of the socialist planned economies at enterprise, national and international levels. His work has sought to apply Keynesian economic theory to the analysis of the socialist planned economies and he identified the systemic problems that were neglected by the ruling communist parties, and which contributed to the disintegration of the economic system at the end of the 1980s. Major works Soviet Economics (1970) gives an overview of the economic system of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) from its foundation until the cautious economic reforms of Khrushchev and Brezhnev. The study examines the evolving political priorities of the communist party leadership in the context of the Marxist theoretical framework; the challenges of the Civil War; foreign intervention and the 1941 invasion; post-war reconstruction; and the attempt to gain military and economic parity with the USA. At each point, Kaser describes how the internal dialogue between enterprises, consumers and the state apparatus influenced the strategies adopted for economic growth and agricultural and industrial development. Kaser highlights the contributions made to the internal debate by N I Bukharin, G V Plekhanov, E A Preobrazhensky, N D Kondratiev, A V Chayanov, V G Groman, L V Kantorovich, Ye G Liberman, G A Feldman, V V Novozhilov, Branko Horvat and A G Aganbegyan. He is critical of the approaches of Western Marxists (for example, Paul A. Baran and Paul M Sweezy) and of Joan Robinson as presenting an over simplified picture of the way decision-making operated and of tending to conflate state ownership with control over resources. He argues that because the planning procedures had changed little since the first Five Year Plan (1928‚Äì32), enterprises were forced to engage in numerous deals over the composition and timing of their supplies and deliveries that in turn manifested itself in both chronic shortages and persistent waste. The \\"three laws of socialism\\" promulgated by Stalin, which in effect meant that heavy industry was given preference over the production of consumer goods, along with a high rate of saving and the maintenance of a stable proportion in the shares of national output between agriculture and industry, held back the growth of national income in comparison with market oriented industrial countries, notably the USA. Kaser explains how the invention of mathematical tools to achieve balance in a planned economy were swept aside under Stalin and continued to be viewed with suspicion until the 1960s. Even so, he doubts whether such computerised techniques could in practice generate efficient pricing and assure balanced growth and general economic equilibrium in the USSR. In Planning in East Europe (1970) Kaser and Janusz Zieli≈Ñski describe the management of industry in Eastern Europe as comprising typically several tiers of organisation: the central planning and control authorities, the enterprise or combination (or group) of enterprises, the material-technical supply organisations and the banks, and domestic retail and foreign trade organisations. The authors analyse the scope of planning and of markets, the tension between directives and competition, price-setting and the relations between managers and workers. The book covers the context and options for economic reform in Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Eastern Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Yugoslavia. In Comecon (second edition, 1967), Kaser presents the history and prospects of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA), or Comecon, which published the barest minimum about itself. The study includes extracts and summaries of the CMEA charter and principles, its internal organisation and procedures and its approach towards pricing, technical co-operation, investment and integration based upon specialisation and the division of labour within the socialist bloc. The political context of the CMEA's activities are set out, as are the theoretical considerations in which Kaser includes an extended discussion of the role of international and internal markets in the bloc's aim of \\"developing and consolidating a world economic system of socialism\\", and intended to include eventually the developing countries of Asia and Africa. Kaser highlights the difficulty facing an economy planned on a national basis has in integrating trading relations and foreign direct investment without devolving decision- making to enterprises and without establishing a clearing mechanism for transactions or introducing currency convertibility. He identifies as a key problem the contradictory objectives set for the CMEA of maintaining a balance of payments, cost-minimization and the development of domestic resources without providing for the transfer capital between richer and poorer CMEA members or the alignment of internal prices with world prices. Life and career His father Charles Kaser (1898‚Äì1983) was a French-speaking Swiss who settled in Britain as a banker and married an English woman Mabel (1891‚Äì1976), who had served on the staff of the UK Delegation to the Versailles Peace Conference. An early facility in the English and French languages was stimulated at home and by his Catholic influenced political interests, to the extent that he learnt Serbo-Croat to attend a youth conference in Zagreb and Belgrade in 1946, where he was one of the few non-communist speakers called to the podium. He attended Gunnersbury Catholic Grammar School and Wimbledon College in London. He completed the Cambridge Economic Tripos in 1943‚Äì45 in two years, as required by wartime regulations, where his tutors were A C Pigou and Gerald Shove, and was directed to the Economics Section of the UK Ministry of Works, which was then planning the post-war house building programme. In 1947 he joined the economic research staff at the UK Foreign Office and served as Second Secretary, Commercial Secretariat, at the British Embassy in Moscow. A paper on Soviet price reform published in the Economic Journal (1950) led to an invitation onto the research staff of the UN Economic Commission for Europe in Geneva. Between 1951 and 1963 he participated in missions to five of the Soviet Republics and to all eight Central and East European states. He learnt Russian and Polish in the 1940s and 1950s and later added Albanian, Hungarian and Romanian. In Geneva, he met his wife Elizabeth (b. 1925), a technical editor at the World Health Organization (married 1954) with whom he raised five children. He became Visiting Professor at the Graduate Institute for International Studies of the University of Geneva, Switzerland (1959‚Äì63) and a visiting lecturer at the international business school INSEAD, Fontainebleau, France (1958‚Äì91). When the British government funded an expansion of university posts in Soviet and Eastern European studies he gained an appointment (1963) at the University of Oxford jointly with a research fellowship at St Antony's College, then a center for regional studies and with close links into government. On his promotion to a University Readership in Economics (1972), the College elected him a Professorial Fellow. He served on and chaired many University Boards and committees, including the General Board of the Faculties. He served similarly at London, Birmingham and Reading Universities. He held short- and long-term Visiting Lectureships and Professorships in the UK, Europe (Europa Institute, Amsterdam) and the United States (Universities of Michigan and Stanford). Other professional institutions on the committees of which he served included the Royal Economic Society, the Royal Institute of International Affairs and the International Committee for Slavonic and East European Studies. Government service over some forty years included frequent requests for consultancies from Ministries and from the House of Commons and in the mid-1980s briefing sessions for the Prime Minister. He participated in a meeting convened by the Prime Minister in 1984 ahead of a visit by Mikhail Gorbachev, following which Margaret Thatcher made her famous remark that \\"I like Mr. Gorbachev. We can do business together\\".http://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/105592 Retrieved 10 October 2013 From time to time he was also consulted for his expertise not only on the USSR and Eastern Europe, but also on health and education economics. He undertook work for many international organisations ‚Äì several UN agencies, the European Commission, the IMF, EBRD and NATO ‚Äì and industry, including Consolidated Gold Fields and the oil and gas companies ENI and Shell, and wrote regularly for The Economist Intelligence Unit and ‚ÄúThe Annual Register‚Äù. He served on the editorial boards of four professional journals and three trusteeships: the Foundation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, known as Cumberland Lodge; Plater College, Oxford, then a Catholic adult education foundation; and the Keston Institute for the study of religion and communist countries, also based in Oxford at that time.http://www.nato.int/docu/speech/2001/s0110262.htm Retrieved 11 October 2013 Kaser was influenced by his father‚Äôs Social Christian values and joined the British Liberal Party in 1945 at the General Election of that year. He was awarded the Order of St Gregory the Great by the Holy See in 1990 for his contribution to adult education at Plater College, Oxford. The Berisha government of Albania awarded him the Order of Naim Frash√´ri in 1995 and the Polish government recognised his contribution with the Knight‚Äôs Cross, Order of Merit in 1999. He was instrumental in helping the Polish economist W≈Çodzimierz Brus find a position at Oxford University after being forced to leave Poland in 1972. He assisted numerous students from Eastern Europe in developing their academic careers. Kaser was an acknowledged Western expert on the socialist countries and maintained good contacts with his peers in those countries, including many reformers.Michael Simmons, East European Correspondent, '‚ÄôFinancial Times'‚Äô, 26 June 1970 A thorough knowledge of data and sources together with inside information gave his publications weight. He contributed some 370 articles to scholarly journals, authored seven books and edited specialist and general works on economics, economic history, health economics and labour economics. He was the General Editor of the proceedings of the International Economic Association between 1986 and 2008. Kaser withdrew from active involvement in academic and charitable work as he approached his 80th birthday.

In 1860, Jonas published a critique of the Habsburg education system ‚Äì primarily how it favored Germans over Slavs. The authorities confiscated all copies, expelled Jonas from school, and he escaped to London. In 1863 Jonas came to Racine, to edit a new Czech-language newspaper Slavie. Next year he married Kristina Korizek, the daughter of the founder of the paper. Through the Civil War, he and his paper supported the Union cause and the Republican party. In 1870 he returned to Europe to cover the Franco-Prussian War. When that ended in 1871, he slipped back into Prague for six or seven months, and wrote tracts like \\"Reasons for the Defeat of France\\" and \\"Women in Human Society, Especially in England and America.\\" But he had left Austria ten years before without an exit visa and without serving his military obligations, so he soon returned to America. Back in Racine, he continued publishing, and became the first leader in the Czech-American community. He also worked to help Czech immigrants adapt to the U.S. and the English language. He produced a primer called Spelling Book and First Reader for Czech-Slavic Youth in America, and the first known Czech-English dictionary. As the Republican establishment of the time became more aligned with capitalists and prohibitionists, Jonas's sympathies turned to the Horace Greeley's Liberal Republican candidacy, and then the Democratic Party. In 1876 he won a seat on Racine's common council for the fourth ward, which was largely Czech, and from 1878 to 1880 he served as president of that council. In 1877 he was elected to the Wisconsin assembly, where he advocated for labor causes, focusing on child labor issues.Celebrating 175 years: Karel Jonas statue June 23, 2010Racine Post In 1878 he and Kristina built the house which is the subject of this article. Though the house now looks a bit whimsical and exotic, the original did not. Where the round corner and turret now stand was open space, so the original house had a gabled-ell form, 2-story brick Italianate with segmentally arched windows and deep eaves supported by wooden brackets. The main entry was at the inside corner of the ell. The house was thoroughly dignified and standard for the time. In 1885 Jonas won a seat on the State Senate. In 1887 his political connections got him placed as diplomatic consul in his beloved Prague, where he advocated expanding U.S. trade with the region and shared American farming techniques with Czech farmers. This patronage position ended with the first Cleveland administration and he returned to Wisconsin. In 1890 Jonas was elected Lieutenant Governor under Governor George W. Peck. In 1894 he resigned that post and was appointed consul to several cities in Europe. Disappointed with his appointments and somewhat estranged from his wife, he died in Germany in 1896. Peter Stoffel, a merchant, bought the house from Jonas in 1894. Some time between 1901 and 1908, Stoffel filled in the ell, adding the rounded corner and turret, added the 2-story bay on the south side, and the pedimented portico which now shelters the front door.

The present scheme was established in 2003. There is a similar scheme in the NHS in Northern Ireland. In the Welsh NHS there are commitment awards for consultants. In Scotland there is a similar scheme run by the Scottish Advisory Committee on Distinction Awards. The schemes are intended to reward consultants who show commitment to the NHS - i.e. do not practice privately. The administration of the scheme nationally is in the hands of the Advisory Committee on Clinical Excellence Awards. There are 12 levels of award. Levels 1-8 are awarded locally by employing NHS Trusts, and levels 10-12 (silver, gold and platinum hereafter) are awarded nationally. Level 9 awards can be awarded locally or nationally, and are referred to as bronze. In 2016-17 awards were worth ¬£2,986 for level one, ¬£35,832 for bronze, ¬£47,110 for silver, ¬£58,888 for gold and ¬£76,554 for platinum annually. Payments are pensionable. Consultants have to reapply after 5 years and a small minority lose their award. 25,300 consultants in England and Wales (54%) received a local or national excellence award in 2016-17. Rates have not increased since 2010 and the number of awards has been reduced. Rules have changed so that renewal is no longer automatic. Radical changes or abolition were repeatedly suggested as part of the consultant contract negotiations from 2010 and in 2018 radical changes to the local scheme were agreed between NHS Employers and the British Medical Association. New points will be time limited for between one and three years, the award will not be pensionable and will paid annually by lump sum. These changes will not apply to the national scheme. Applicants are assessed in five areas: * Domain 1 ‚Äì Delivering a High Quality Service Evidence should show achievements in delivering a service which is safe, quality assured, and where opportunities for improvement are consistently sought and implemented. * Domain 2 ‚Äì Developing a High Quality Service Evidence should show how applicants have significantly enhanced the quality and safety of the local service(s) more widely within the NHS. * Domain 3 ‚Äì Leadership and Managing a High Quality Service Evidence should show how applicants have made a substantial personal contribution managing a local service, or national/international health policy development. * Domain 4 ‚Äì Research and Innovation Evidence should show how applicants have made a contribution to research over and above their contractual obligations. * Domain 5 ‚Äì Teaching and Training Evidence should show how teaching and training forms a major part of the contribution applicants make to the NHS, over and above contractual obligations. The nature of the scheme tends to reward academic clinicians who can produce impressive and well documented research. The coalition government conducted a review of the scheme whose report was published in 2012. History The earlier scheme of distinction awards was established at the foundation of the NHS in 1948 as part of Aneurin Bevan's efforts to win support from doctors by \\"stuffing their mouths with gold\\". The Royal Commission on the National Health Service described the system of distinction awards in 1979. Awards were made on the advice of the Advisory Committee on Distinction, a predominantly professional body traditionally headed by a distinguished doctor. The total value of awards was about ¬£20m per annum, 10% of total consultant remuneration. About half of all consultants received an award during their careers. At any one time, just over a third were award holders. There were four levels of award, with annual values ranging from ¬£2,664 for level C with 3421 beneficiaries to ¬£11,880 for A+ awards of which there were 140. Awards were then secret, and there was criticism that most went to consultants in teaching hospitals and the more glamorous specialities. In 2015-16 ¬£157 million was paid to 2,948 consultants in England and Wales. In 2016-17 ¬£147 million was paid to 2,779 consultants. 300 awards were made in 2017. In 2019 the Care Quality Commission suggested that awards should be withheld from doctors at trusts in special measures.

He held the positions of Federal Deputy in the LXII Legislature of the Congress of the Union in Mexico, President of the Chamber of Deputies in Mexico and leader of the Parliamentary Group of the main opposing party in the Chamber of Deputies in Mexico. He held the position of National President of the National Action Party until 9 December 2017, when he resigned to run in the 2018 presidential election for the PAN party in political coalition with the leftist parties Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) and Citizens' Movement (MC). Since January 2019 he has been a visiting professor of politics at the School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University. Emilio Lozoya Austin, former head of PEMEX, accused Anaya in July 2020 of receiving a MXN $6,8 million bribe to support energy reform in 2013-2014. Anaya denied the charge and insisted he had supported privatization of PEMEX out of conviction. Academic background Ricardo Anaya Cort√©s holds a Bachelor of Law with honors from the Universidad Aut√≥noma de Quer√©taro. He also has a master's degree in Tax Law from Universidad del Valle de M√©xico, from which he graduated with honors, and a Ph.D. in Political Science and Social Studies, again with honors, from Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de M√©xico (UNAM). He has been a permanent lecturer in Constitutional Law and State Theory in the Law School of Universidad Aut√≥noma de Quer√©taro. Labor and party trajectory Ricardo Anaya is a member of the National Action Party. In 2000, when he was 21 years old, he was PAN's candidate for Local Deputy in the XIV District of Quer√©taro, which comprised Arroyo Seco and Pinal de Amoles municipalities, and he achieved an increase of more than 400% in votes for his party in relation with the previous election. He was Private Secretary for the Governor of the State of Quer√©taro from 2003 to 2009 and he held the position of Human Development Coordinator of the Government of the State of Quer√©taro from 2008 to 2009. He was a Local Deputy for the LVI Legislature of the State of Quer√©taro, where he held the position of Coordinator of the National Action Party's Parliamentary Group, which was the largest one. He was President of the State Managing Committee of his party in the State of Quer√©taro from February 2010 to 31 March 2011, and on 1 April 2011 he was appointed Tourism Planning Undersecretary of the Ministry of Tourism of the Federal Government by the Mexican President, Felipe Calder√≥n Hinojosa. He was elected Federal Deputy under the proportional representation principle for the LXII Legislature, from 2012 to 2015, where he held the position of President of the Chamber of Deputies from 1 September 2013 to 5 March 2014. On 30 September 2014, Gustavo Madero Mu√±oz took leave of absence from his position as PAN's President to lead the list of deputies under proportional representation of his party in the 2015 Election, and therefore, the Permanent Commission of the party appointed Ricardo Anaya Cort√©s who then held the position of General Secretary of the party, as National President and Fernando √Ålvarez Monje was appointed as the new General Secretary. On 20 January 2015, when Madero Mu√±oz was plurinominal Federal Deputy candidate, he went back to leading the party and appointed Anaya Cort√©s as the new PAN's Parliamentary Group Coordinator in the Chamber of Deputies, while Jos√© Isabel Trejo Reyes who held the position of PAN Deputies‚Äô Coordinator, was elected as the new General Secretary of the party. In 2015 he was a contender for the National President position in his party, and he won with more than 80% of votes against Javier Corral Jurado. In 2017 Ricardo Anaya Cort√©s met the German Chancellor Angela Merkel to discuss the international situation after Donald Trump‚Äôs election as President of the United States. Likewise, he gave a lecture at the George Washington University on the relations between Mexico and the United States, where he openly rejected Trump‚Äôs idea of building a wall on the border between both countries as \\"insulting and unacceptable\\". Anaya was one of the candidates for President of Mexico in the general elections to be held on July 1, 2018. In polls, Anaya scored second behind Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador. On July 1, 2018, Anaya came in second, losing the election to L√≥pez Obrador.

It is the largest of a planned four camps with its total capacity of 8,000 inmates. Together with the Ktzi'ot prison, Sadot prison and the Nachal Raviv tent camp they detain South Sudanese, Sudanese and Eritrean asylum seekers who crossed the border from Egypt to Israel. Since 2010 provisions were made to detain the immigrants in the old Ktzi'ot Prison, formally used as a detention camp for Palestinians. On January 10, 2012 the Israeli parliament (Knesset) voted a controversial amendment bill to the 1954 Prevention of Infiltration Law that made detention for up to three years possible for African immigrants, without trial. In the spring of 2012 the construction of the Saharonim Prison was started, exempt from most local and national regulations, as requested by the Israeli Defense Ministry.  Location  The prison is located in the southern Negev desert, close to the Israeli-Egyptian border. The region is known for its harsh living conditions both in summer as in winter. Controversies On June 24, 2013 a hunger strike was started by 350 mostly Eritrean detainees in blocks 3 and 4 of the prison. In a letter by one of the hunger strikers that was published in Hebrew, described their encounter with immigration authority officers during the hunger strike: As of September 2013 there were around 1,800 refugees imprisoned, 1,400 of them in Saharonim and 400 in Ktziot. In September 2013 the Supreme Court of Israel ruled that imprisoning African migrants for long periods, is unconstitutional. The court also ruled that migrants, refugees and asylum seekers detained in the Ktziot and Saharonim prisons should be released within 90 days and those that cross the border illegally can only be detained for one year in the future. The Israeli government has responded by passing an amended law to reduce the period of detention to one year and proposed the indefinite detention in \\"open\\" detention centers without judicial review. As of January 2014, some 2,500 asylum seekers are housed at Saharonim and Ktziot prisons, 41 of them children imprisoned with their parents. Of these, 15 are infants and toddlers up to the age of two, and 26 are children up to the age of 10.

It was built in 1820, and is a two-story, Federal style, brick building. Only the right half of the building, with two stories and the bays were part of the original structure. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Inge's Store is a grocery, built in the Federal Style, in 1820 by Johnson W. Pitt, originally as a residence. Its significance is in its style, its metal canopy, and its historic ownership, belonging to and operated by the same family since 1890. In 1820, Pitt bought two unimproved lots from Joseph Bishop for 100 dollars. Pitt built a house on the lot, and sold it to Lawrence P. Catlett for $1,000 in September 1821. Catlett sold the property for $812.84 in September 1828 to William F. Gooch, who sold it in January 1883 for $700. A brick kitchen was added during this time. In 1841 it was purchased, with improvements, for $2,000 by the Methodist Episcopal Church to be used as a parsonage. The church was forced to sell the house at public auction to Nimrod Sowell for $1,220 in 1842. In 1850 it was purchased by Harris & Taylor and became an iron foundry. In November 1853 it was sold to Musgrove and Patterson, merchants. When Musgrove and Patterson's business ended, the property was sold for $1,900 to John M. Barksdale and John N. Fry. During their 4-year ownership a smokehouse was added. In 1863, the property was sold to Isaac and Simon Letterman for $4,050. In 1887, the property was sold for $2,500 to Liebichen Levine, who then sold it to George Pinkney Inge for $3,000 in February 1890. Inge had been born a slave. He worked as a school teacher in Charlottesville, but opened the building at 331-333 West Main for business in July 1891. The Inge family continued to operate the property until it was sold to Leslie C. Lafon in December 1979. By 1896, the building had doubled in size, with a second wing added. By 1907 a frame porch was added to the rear, and by 1920 more rooms were added, bringing the building to its current shape.

Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at: http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=719071 on 2020-03-12 Description (Original description by Hedley & Petterd) The height of the shell attains 12 mm, its diameter 16 mm. The thin shell is rather large and regularly turbinate with an elevated spire. The base of the shell is flattened. The periphery is subangled. The seven whorls increase gradually in size. They are regularly rounded except a narrow flat step below the suture. Colour of the shell is white beneath, and above pale cinnamon with darker radial streaks on the body whorl. The entire surface is glossy, as if well oiled. The sculpture is closely scored by sharp spiral cuts, which are deepest about the periphery, fainter midway up the whorl and vanish from the base and from the first four whorls. On the penultimate whorl between the insertion of the lip and the suture, there are sixteen of these impressed spirals. The flat interspaces are obliquely ci'ossed by faint irregular growth lines. The aperture is very oblique ovate. Its upper insertion is carried far forward, connected with the lower by a thin dull film of callus. The lip is quite sharp, within a white edge is followed by a brown border anfl that again by a nacreous layer. This sequence again appears along the interior suture. The umbilicus forms a broad open funnel, penetrating to the initial whorl, margined by a beaded funicle which ends in an expansion on the columella base. The interior of the umbilicus is spirally scored like the periphery, and is undercut at the junction of each whorl.Hedley, C. & Petterd, W.P. 1906.

The competition jury stated that \\"the film is remarkable in the way it connects contemporary political issues with emotional dilemmas.

The result embodies a poetic and restrained approach to questions which unfortunately are becoming more and more commonplace.

He serves as a senator of the LXIV Legislature of the Mexican Congress, representing the state of Guerrero. He also is a two-time federal deputy and two-time former mayor of Acapulco. Life A√±orve was born in Ometepec, Guerrero, Mexico, on 15 May 1957. A√±orve graduated with his law degree from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) in 1981; he would later return to the university to obtain his master's and doctoral degrees. He was the private secretary to the head of the Secretariat of Agrarian Reform from 1981 to 1982. After several years spent earning more degrees, writing a book titled Los Servicios P√∫blicos Municipales (Municipal Public Services), and becoming a state political councilor for the PRI, A√±orve returned to the federal government in 1991 as the representative of Banobras in Guerrero. In 1993, he became a city councilor in Acapulco, simultaneously heading up the city's water and sewer commission and serving as the secretary general of the municipal PRI organization there. In 1996, A√±orve was named as the state secretary of finances and administration. A year later, however, Hurricane Pauline slammed into Acapulco and prompted a municipal political crisis that concluded with the resignation of the city's municipal president, Juan Salgado Tenorio. Interim Governor √Ångel Aguirre Rivero selected A√±orve, his cousin, as the interim municipal president of Acapulco, filling the remaining two years of Tenorio's term. With his term expired, in 1999, A√±orve became a state deputy, cutting that term short in order to become a federal deputy in the LVIII Legislature. He was among the PRI's highest ranking officials, becoming the secretary of the board of directors of the Permanent Commission, along with three normal commission assignments. A√±orve resurfaced in 2006 as the coordinator of advisors to the PRI caucus in the Senate. He left that job to run again for mayor of Acapulco, winning a second term and serving from 2009 to 2012. While serving as municipal president, he ran for Governor of Guerrero in 2010. The PRI named A√±orve a proportional representation deputy from the fourth region to the LXII Legislature, in which he served between 2012 and 2015. He presided over the Administration Committee and special commission commemorating the bicentennial of the Congreso de An√°huac and the Sentimientos de la Naci√≥n, and he held secretarial posts on three commissions‚ÄîNational Defense, Jurisdictional, and Oversight of the Supreme Auditor of the Federation‚Äîalong with two other regular assignments.

The experiments use CsI(Tl) crystals at Yangyang Underground Laboratory (Y2L), in tunnels from a preexisting underground power plant. KIMS is supported by the Creative Research Initiative program of the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation. It is the first physics experiment located, and largely built, in Korea. Other research topics include detector development for a neutrinoless double beta decay search and the creation of an extreme low temperature diamond calorimeter. History The KIMS experiment was funded in 2000 to search for WIMP dark matter. To avoid the cost of creating a new tunnel for testing, the Yangyang Pumped Storage Power Plant belonging to Korea Middleland Power Co. in Yangyang, Korea was used. Construction was completed in 2003. The CsI(Tl) scintillating crystal used has a high light yield and is affordable for large mass. After a substantial effort for the initial setup and crystal development, KIMS began recording data in 2004 with one full-size 6 kg crystal. A 4 crystal setup was run in 2005-2006 to optimize the WIMP search. In 2008, the 12 crystal array with 103.4 kg mass was completed and ran until December 2012 for a detector upgrade replacing the PMTs.  Results  The first WIMP cross section search was published in 2006 using the one crystal data. New limits were presented in 2007 and 2012, inconsistent with the DAMA signal reports for masses above 20 GeV. Using 24324.3 kg days exposure, low-mass WIMP signals below 20 GeV were disfavored in 2014.  COSINE  The KIMS and DM-Ice groups have joined forces to make a new detector consisting of an array of NaI(Tl) scintillating crystals to confirm or refute the DAMA/LIBRA results. , the 100 kg COSINE-100 experiment had been installed at Y2L. In September 2016, physics data started to be collected. The next version of the COSINE detector, COSINE-200, will be constructed in Yemi Laboratory in Jeongseon County. The COSINE-100 published its first results on 5 December 2018 in Nature; they concluded that their result \\"rules out WIMP‚Äìnucleon interactions as the cause of the annual modulation observed by the DAMA collaboration\\". This rejection applies only to WIMPs with one of the 18 tested masses, exhibiting spin-independent interactions with sodium or iodine nucleons, within the context of a standard dark matter halo model.

Through this work, ERA also cares for protecting and developing of European cultural heritage and for strengthening of mutual understanding between European citizens. Already at the beginning of its existence, ERA started creating a network of European long-distance paths maintained by its member organisations to make it possible to walk all over Europe on foot to strengthen the connection people to people over the borders. From 2017 the network consists of 12 E-paths and covers more than 70.000 km crisscrossing Europe. An E-path is a long-distance path crossing a minimum of 3 European countries. Marking and maintenance of the path is the responsibility of the member organisations. To bring walkers in Europe together, ERA organizes every 5 years a pan-European walking event EURORANDO. Next edition is in 2021. In order to secure a high standard of European paths, ERA developed a transparent system of criteria for the improvement of trail quality: Leading Quality Trails ‚Äì Best of Europe. These criteria assess the trail surface format, the marking, signposting and network with other walking trails. Part of the criteria is also the service for walkers along the trail or access points for a transport. The Leading Quality Trails (LQT) are certified walking routes in Europe. Certification is only available for complete trails. Prerequisite is a distance of at least 50km with three daily stages. Further, through its programme Walk Leader ERA provides certification for the training of voluntary walk leaders performed by its member organisations. ERA was founded in 1969.

It was renamed Out West in January 1902. In 1923, it merged into Overland Monthly to become Overland Monthly and Out West Magazine, which existed until 1935. The magazine published the work of many notable authors, including John Muir, Jack London, Mary Hunter Austin, Sharlot Hall, Grace Ellery Channing, and Sui Sin Far (Edith Maude Eaton). The Land of Sunshine was also known for its \\"lavish\\" use of illustrations, many of which were halftone photoengravings. In the words of Jon Wilkman, the magazine \\"extolled the wonders of Southern California and had a major influence on the region‚Äôs early image and appeal to tourists\\".  History  The Land of Sunshine was first published by the F. A. Pattee Publishing Company in June 1894 as a quarto measuring . It was originally ghost-edited by Charles Dwight Willard, while Harry Ellington Brook and Frank A. Pattee were both also involved in the creation and publication of the magazine. Willard was secretary of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce while he edited The Land of Sunshine, which from its inception was supportive of commercial interests in Los Angeles and San Diego to the extent that it would have caused a clear conflict of interest controversy if Willard was publicly linked to the magazine. According to Edwin Bingham, in its first volume The Land of Sunshine developed a long-standing dichotomy between covering regional commerce and culture. From its beginning, the magazine also took concerted measures to increase its circulation, including both imploring its readers to share copies with their friends and supplying public libraries around the United States with issues of the magazine. At the end of 1894 Charles Fletcher Lummis was publicly named editor of The Land of Sunshine, and the first issue produced under his control was January 1895. Lummis promised that the magazine's coverage of Southern California would be \\"concise, interesting, expert, accurate\\" to the extent that it would be trusted by Eastern readers. He also placed an increased emphasis on the cultural and intellectual content of the magazine. According to the Los Angeles Times, he transformed the magazine from a \\"Chamber of Commerce promotional sheet\\" into a \\"sterling literary magazine\\" in which he voiced his own opinions about everything from art and philosophy to politics and current events. Perhaps his favorite subjects, however, were championing Native American rights and criticizing the Federal Indian Policy. Lummis was regarded as an \\"impulsive firebrand\\" as a thinker and a writer, and his ideas, both in The Land of Sunshine and other works, often had a polarizing effect on other writers and academics. In June 1895, the magazine was reduced to dimensions of , although its total number of pages grew. The cover of the April 1903 issue of Out West In 1898, Lummis expanded the scope of the magazine to include the entire West, which he defined as anything \\"which is far enough away from the East to be Out from Under\\". This was accentuated by the magazine's change of name to Out West in January 1902. During his tenure as editor, Lummis maintained relations of various kinds with other periodicals, both in the Western United States and the country at large: this included amicable relations with The Nation and The Dial, an antagonistic relationship with Overland Monthly, and a more complex relationship with The Argonaut, as Lummis lauded the latter's anti-imperialist stance but criticized it for at times being anti-Catholic. Lannie Haynes Martin, editor of Out West in 1922 Lummis edited the magazine by himself until the February 1903 issue, when he was joined by Charles Amadon Moody: together, they would edit the magazine until Lummis departed in November 1909. According to Bingham, the magazine's influence and reputation as one of the Pacific Coast's premier publications ended with Lummis' departure. Out West subsequently witnessed a succession of editors that included C. F. Edholm, George Wharton James, and Lannie Haynes Martin, and it \\"ceased to appear with any regularity\\" after its June 1917 issue. In May 1923, it was consolidated with Overland Monthly to form Overland Monthly and Out West Magazine, which remained in publication until July 1935.  Publication and circulation  At the beginning of its existence, The Land of Sunshine was printed and bound by Kingsley-Barnes and Neuner Company in the Stimson Building while its photoengraving needs were handled by a variety of local companies. In 1898, the magazine began in-house publication in a building on South Broadway that combined editorial and printing functions, which by late 1901 boasted six job presses and four cylinder presses, one of which was an Optimus cylinder used principally for printing illustrated pages. In April 1904, the printing of the magazine was once again physically separated from its editorial offices, and this arrangement persisted until Lummis departed in 1909. Initially, The Land of Sunshine was published by the F. A. Pattee Publishing Company, but in August 1895 these duties were assumed by the newly incorporated Land of Sunshine Publishing Co., which at its inception consisted of W.C. Patterson (president), Lummis (vice president), Pattee (secretary and business manager), H.J. Fleishman (treasurer), Charles Cassat Davis (attorney), and Cyrus M. Davis. While Willard initially had the largest individual financial stake in the magazine, Lummis eventually bought him out with financial backing from Phoebe Hearst, the mother of newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst. Lummis retained his interests in the magazine until his departure from it in 1909. The Land of Sunshine's circulation reached 9,000 in December 1895, which its publishers claimed was \\"the largest certified regular circulation of any western monthly\\". In July 1899, the magazine's average circulation was 9,147. The magazine enjoyed its highest circulation in 1903 (10,766) and 1904 (an estimated 15,000). Measuring the circulation of Out West after 1903 is challenging because the actual figures were not kept or provided to newspaper directories, which resorted to consistently estimating its circulation at between 7,500 and 12,500 after 1904. In the United States, most of the magazine's subscribers were in California, followed in decreasing order by the Arizona Territory, New York, Massachusetts, and the New Mexico Territory. The Land of Sunshine counted Theodore Roosevelt as one of its subscribers, and he told Lummis that during his Presidency it was the only magazine that he \\"took time to read\\". The magazine also had some semblance of an international scope: in January 1907, Out West claimed subscribers in England, Belgium, Italy, Germany, Japan, France, Sweden, Brazil, New Zealand, Mexico, Greece, Siam, and North China.  Contributors  Charles Fletcher Lummis, editor and most frequent contributor in the history of the magazine Throughout its early existence, The Land of Sunshine had difficulty securing contributions from freelance writers, largely because of its specific focus on Californian and Western themes and its inability to pay standard rates. The issue was so acute when Lummis began editing the magazine that he often contributed a \\"disproportionate\\" amount of content, which sometimes resulted in him resorting to contributing under transparent pseudonyms such as C. Arloz and C. R. Lohs, references to his nickname Don Carlos. In an effort to recruit writers for the magazine, Lummis organized a \\"syndicate of established writers\\" interested in writing Western content and paid them with stock certificates in the Land of Sunshine Publishing Co. in lieu of cash payments. Members of this syndicate, which included different types of writers as well as artists, included George Parker Winship, Frederick Webb Hodge, Maynard Dixon, William Keith, Ina Coolbrith, Edwin Markham, Theodore H. Hittell, David Starr Jordan, Ella Higginson, John Vance Cheney, Charles Warren Stoddard, George Hamlin Fitch, Washington Matthews, Charles and Louise Keller, Charlotte Perkins Stetson, Joaquin Miller, Elliott Coues, Eugene Manlove Rhodes, Sharlot Hall, and Mary Hunter Austin. Grace Ellery Channing was also a prominent contributor to The Land of Sunshine. Over the history of the magazine, Lummis contributed the most content: a total of more than 250 essays, articles, poems, and stories. After him, the next most frequent contributors were William E. Smythe (with 48 total contributions), Sharlot Hall (42), and Julia Boynton Green (23). In addition to writing for the magazine, Lummis also founded two organizations of similar scope and purpose: the Landmarks Club, which was dedicated to preserving the Spanish missions in the region from further deterioration, and the Southwest Society, which ultimately evolved into the Southwest Museum of the American Indian.

As a child he assisted with excavations at the York Museum Gardens‚Äî\\"digging holes all around the Museum Gardens in a way we'd never be able to do now,\\" as he described it, and sifting through spoil heaps to find artefacts. He attended Sedbergh School and Norwood College, at which point he and some schoolmates discovered at Underbank, near Sedbergh, a medieval village; they published a report of their excavation in the Yorkshire Archaeological Journal before graduating. After Norwood Addyman moved on to Peterhouse at Cambridge University, obtaining a degree in archaeology, and in 1960 directing excavations at Maxey. He took the tripos in 1961 at the same time as fellow scholar Martin Biddle. Career The Coppergate helmet was discovered during development led by Addyman. Following his time at Cambridge Addyman worked at Queen's University Belfast, from 1962 to 1964 as an assistant lecturer in archaeology, and from then until 1967 as a lecturer. From 1967 until 1972, he taught as a junior lecturer in Archaeology at the University of Southampton. During this time he variously directed excavations at Lydford (1964‚Äì1967), Ludgershall Castle (1964‚Äì1972), and Chalton (1970‚Äì1972). Addyman's path was bent towards academia, when in 1971 he was commissioned to analyse the impact of a proposed road in York. His resulting report suggested the city establish an archaeological unit for excavations, suggesting it would serve both educational and touristic purposes. The money was found for the unit; he was offered the directorship; and from its founding in 1972 until 2002, Addyman served as the director of the York Archaeological Trust. During that time he was responsible for archaeological excavations in York, and directed the development of the Jorvik Viking Centre, the Archaeological Resource Centre, and Barley Hall. Addyman and the Trust oversaw the publication of more than 60 volumes about the archaeology of York, and added tens of thousands of items to their collection. The Anglo-Saxon Coppergate helmet was discovered during the excavations for the building of the Jorvik Centre, inspiring several of Addyman's publications. Addyman retired from the York Archaeological Trust on 30 September 2002, exactly 30 years after taking charge. \\"Archaeologists retire to do archaeology,\\" he said at the time; he is currently the chairman of the Malton Museum Foundation, a position he has held since 2012, the president of the York Civic Trust, and since 2007 the director of Continuum Group Ltd. In addition to his primary occupations, Addyman has served in various capacities for many different organisations. From 1981 to 1983 he served as the vice-president of the Council for British Archaeology, and from 1992 until 1995 as its president. He was also the vice-president of the Royal Archaeological Institute from 1979 until 1983. In addition to his current chairmanship, he was the chairman of the Standing Conference of Archaeological Unit Managers from its 1975 founding until 1978, the Institute of Field Archaeologists from 1983 to 1985, Cultural Resource Management Ltd from 1989 to 1995 (and director from 1979 to 1995), the Standing Conference on Portable Antiquities from 1995 to 2005, the Standing Conference on London Archaeology from 2005 to 2007, the Yorkshire Dales Landscape Research Trust from 2006 until 2016, and the York Civic Trust from 2012 until 2015, and thereafter as the president. Addyman was a member of the Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England from 1997 to 1999, the Ancient Monuments Advisory Committee from 1998 to 2001, the Places of Worship Panel from 2001 to 2004, and, currently of English Heritage. From 1984 to 2007 he was the academic director of Heritage Projects Ltd, and he was the president of the Yorkshire Archaeological Society from 1999 to 2005 and the Yorkshire Philosophical Society from 1999 until 2013. He also served as a trustee of the National Coal Mining Museum from 1995 until 2002, and as governor of the Company of Merchant Adventurers of York from 2006 to 2007. In 1998 he was made an honorary professor at both the University of Bradford in and the University of York. Bradford had previously awarded him an honorary Doctor of Science in 1984, and York a DUniv in 1985. Honours In 2000 Addyman was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire, and in 2004 a Commander of the Royal Norwegian Order of Merit. He is a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London (FSA), a position to which he was elected on 2 March 1967. In 2015 he was one of four individuals awarded the President's Medal by the British Academy, alongside Darren Henley, Elizabeth Livingstone, and Michael Wood. In 2008, Addyman was named an Honorary Freeman of the city of York. It is for those who have served York with distinction, or with notable links to the city; others who have received the award include Joyce Pickard, Sir Ron Cooke, and Dame Janet Baker. Addyman was given a vellum scroll, and the right to drive three sheep or beasts over the historic Ouse Bridge, and to graze three beasts on Knavesmire in the city. As he said when receiving the award, \\"These are very useful things and I expect to use these prerogatives very soon.\\" Sackler Lectures In 2012, Raymond Sackler and his wife Beverly endowed a series of lectures in Honour of Norman Hammond. These lectures are held annually at Peterhouse College, Cambridge, UK and are co- hosted by the McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research. The first Raymond and Beverly Sackler distinguished lecture in Archaeology in Honour of Norman Hammond was given at Peterhouse on 4 November 2015 by Peter Addyman on \\"Creating Heritage: Vikings, Jorvik and Public Interest archaeology. Personal life In 1965 Addyman married Shelton \\"Shelly\\" Addyman (n√©e Oliver). She died on 25 November 2016; the two had met while he was excavating an Anglo-Saxon village in Devon as a research assistant at Queen's University Belfast, and she was a doctoral student from Atlanta, Georgia. He has one son, Tom, and one daughter, Sue, in addition to grandchildren Oscar, Oliver, Harry, and Tatiana. As recreations Addyman enjoys gardening, watercolours, and travel.

Plays written after 1606 avoided such terms as a consequence of the act, and new editions of older plays removed profane words.Oxford Companion to Shakespeare. Some scholars have argued that the Act had an important influence on the revision and publication of the plays of William Shakespeare.Mowat 2005, 91-2. Text of act This Act is listed as \\"Anno 3 Jacobi I Cap 21\\". An Act to restrain Abuses of Players For the preventing and avoiding of the great Abuse of the Holy Name of God in Stage Plays, Enterludes, May Games, Shews and such like; Be it enacted by our Sovereign Lord the King's Majesty, and by the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That if at any time or times after the End of this present Session of Parliament, any Person or Persons do or shall in any Stage-play, Enterlude, Show, May-game or Pageant, jestingly or profanely speak or use the holy Name of God, or of Christ Jesus, or the Holy Ghost, or of the Trinity, which are not to be spoken but with Fear and Reverence, shall forfeit for every such Offence by him or them committed Ten Pounds; the One Moiety thereof to the King's Majesty, his Heirs and Successors, the other Moiety thereof to him or them that will sue for the same in any Court of Record at Westminster, wherein no Essoin, Protection or Wager of Law shall be allowed. \\\\---- (Note that when this Act was passed, a pound in money was the value of a pound weight of silver.)  Impact on dramatic works  Many scholars and editors have argued that the act had a significant impact on English early modern drama.Mowat 2005, 92. The need to comply with the act has been used to explain differences in editions of plays published before and after 1606, such as Othello by William Shakespeare and Volpone by Ben Jonson. However, Barbara Mowat has expressed reservations about the extent of the act's influence. She has highlighted the fact that the act only applied to dramatic performances, and thus changes to printed editions of dramatic works may have stemmed from other influences.Mowat 2005, 97. These influences may have included changing cultural attitudes towards swearing, alterations made by particular scribes (such as Ralph Crane), and the desire to avoid offending particular individuals, such as Sir Henry Herbert, the Master of the Revels from 1624 to 1642.Mowat 2005, 101-2.

It was published by Tyndale House Publishers in 2010 and lists Alex's father Kevin Malarkey as an author along with Alex, although Alex described it in November 2012 as \\"one of the most deceptive books ever.\\"Alex Malarkey, as quoted by Beth Malarkey as quoted by It was adapted into a television film in March 2010. Alex forcefully disavowed the book in an open letter to Christian bookstores almost five years after it was published and more than a million copies were sold, describing his near-death experience as a fabrication. As a result, Tyndale House removed the book from print, and Christian bookstores removed it from their shelves. Alex had suffered various injuries in the accident, including a severe spinal injury, severe neck injuries, and brain trauma, and he was left a quadriplegic. Summary According to his own account, Alex Malarkey says that he and his father were driving on a highway near Rushsylvania, Ohio, when his father turned onto another road and was hit by a car, which he did not see. After the automobile accident, he says he saw his father fly out of the window of his car, only to be caught by an angel and carried to safety. He says he was out of his body while he saw this happen. His body was taken to a hospital in an emergency helicopter. The book says that soon after that he felt an angel take him through the gates of Heaven, which he describes as being \\"tall\\", to meet Jesus, who appears through a \\"hole in heaven\\". After he woke up in the hospital, he told his family his account of his near-death experience. Tyndale House promoted the book as \\"a supernatural encounter that will give you new insights on Heaven, angels, and hearing the voice of God.\\"  Reception and aftermath  Books about purported visits to Heaven make up a popular and highly lucrative genre of religious books in the United States. The 2004 book 90 Minutes in Heaven spent over five years on the New York Times best-seller list and sold over six million copies, while the book Heaven Is for Real has sold over 10 million copies and the film adaptation earned $101 million at the box office. The Boy Who Came Back from Heaven sold 112,386 copies in the first year, and received a platinum award from the Evangelical Christian Publishers Association in 2013 for over a million sales. In November 2012, Alex's mother, Beth Malarkey, wrote several blog posts saying that her family is not in agreement with the content of the book. She expressed frustration with several people calling and visiting their home over the years, saying, \\"[Alex] is just a boy not a statue to be worshipped or person with some supernatural gifts,\\" and, \\"He does not go to Heaven, have conversations with supernatural beings, and whatever visions/experiences he has had or had not had, is up to him as to what he will do with those.\\" Later that month, she claimed the book's account had been embellished, adding that, \\"The truth is getting twisted, distorted, and packaged to be sold to the highest bidder.\\" She also revealed that Alex himself had written a comment on the book's Facebook page in November 2011 calling the book \\"one of the most deceptive books ever.\\" That comment was deleted, and Alex was banned from commenting after the moderators suspected he was an imposter. Beth and Kevin Malarkey have become estranged since the book was published.Public Statement; Beth Malarkey On May 9, 2014, Beth Malarkey appeared on the Christian radio show, The Bible Answer Man, and said that the book is deceptive and embellishes the story of the accident. Beth Malarkey said Alex is still a quadriplegic and cannot legally receive any money from the book.Hank Hanegraaff (June 5, 2014); The Boy Who Came Back from Heaven; The Story Behind the Story; The Bible Answerman, at the Christian Research Institute She also began communicating with Phil Johnson, the executive director of John F. MacArthur's media ministry, Grace to You, in hopes of communicating her story. Johnson said that Beth had told him she and Alex had been trying to publicize for some time that the book was \\"an exaggeration and an embellishment.\\" Johnson subsequently revealed in his blog, The Spurgeon Archive, that Beth Malarkey had sent Tyndale \\"a stack of correspondence\\" in which she stated that Alex not only received no royalties from the book, but that Kevin \\"neglects his duties as a husband and a father\\" and was \\"not even adequately supporting his family financially.\\"Johnson, Phil. Tyndale House Publishers Knew the Malarkey Book Was A Fraud; The Spurgeon Archive, 2015-01-16. She had also revealed this to apologist Justin Peters, who proceeded to e-mail LifeWay leaders Ed Stetzer and Thom S. Rainer. They responded, but the book would not be withdrawn from LifeWay stores for another eight months Emails Suggest Lifeway President Knew of Heaven Scam, Chose Not to Act; Pulpit and Pen; 2015-01-15 According to paranormal researcher Benjamin Radford, part of the reason that the story was so well-received and accepted among its American Christian audience is that it reinforced their existing narratives and beliefs. By sticking closely to a widely accepted interpretation of heaven, God and demons, Malarkey was assured that his story would meet his audience's expectations and be popular. Confession of fraud On January 13, 2015, Alex Malarkey released an open letter to Christian publishers and bookstores via the Christian Apologetics blog known as Pulpit and Pen, confessing that the entire account of his journey to Heaven was fictional, and implored them to remove the book from their stores. In his letter he notes: On January 15, 2015, Tyndale House confirmed it would be withdrawing the book. Lawsuits In 2018, Alex Malarkey filed a lawsuit against Tyndale House, the main publisher based in suburban Chicago, accusing them of charges including defamation and exploitation, seeking an award at least equivalent to the book's profits. That same year Kevin and Beth ended their marriage, with Beth getting custody of Alex (now an adult) and the couple's other children going to live with their father. Beth says she and Alex are in a difficult financial situation and cannot guarantee that they will be able to remain in their house; she would like an accounting of how Kevin spent the money from the book. Kevin, who had not spoken publicly since his son retracted the book's claims, and rebuffed efforts by journalists to contact him, broke his silence in 2019. He told Slate reporter Ruth Graham that he stood by the book. He had not spoken previously because, after prayer, he believed God did not want him to since it would harm his children. Royalties from the book had come to approximately a million dollars, half of it from the advance, but most of it had been spent on Alex's care, or given to his church and other Christian charities, and none of it was left. Recovery In 2009, Alex Malarkey, aged 10, became the youngest person to have the surgical procedure first carried out for Christopher Reeve to allow him to breathe on his own without a ventilator. Later in 2009, he was able to stand upright in a supporting frame and, with helpers moving his legs, to walk on a treadmill.

Their main base is Ballinacurra Weston on Limerick's southside but they also have a strong presence in Southill and in the northside suburb of Moyross. The gang, involved in drug dealing, extortion and armed robbery, have been central players in the Limerick feud, which has claimed up to 13 lives.Family Feud, Anthony Galvin.

The mother-of-two was shot dead outside her home in Swords, Dublin by a lone gunman. It is suspected the murder was ordered by her ex-husband, Lebanese gangster Hassan Hassan.

Main St. in downtown Racine, Wisconsin. Designed by John Mauran in the Beaux-Arts style, the building served as the Racine Public Library from 1904 until 1958, and has housed the Racine Heritage Museum since 1963. It is also the home of the Racine County Historical Society. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on March 20, 1981.  Description  John Mauran designed the building, in an architectural style that has been described varyingly as Beaux-Arts and as Renaissance Revival. The two-story building is constructed of Bedford limestone and brick, with accents in \\"St. Louis granite pressed brick\\" and buff-colored terracotta. This terracotta is used to create many embellished decorations on each of the building's facades. The front of the building faces west toward Main Street, dominated by a Roman arch with an Ionic portico, topped by a broken pediment. The transom plaque, not original to the building, reads \\"Racine County Historical Society\\". The frieze features the words \\"Free to the People\\". On the north facade, facing Seventh Street, a panel reads \\"Intelligence is the Foundation of Prosperity and Social Order\\". An accompanying panel on the south side read \\"Ye Shall Know the Truth and the Truth Shall Make You Free.\\" The original east facade was destroyed by an expansion of the building in 1989, and a 1981 survey records nothing significant about it.  History  The idea of a public library for Racine was first proposed at a meeting of businessmen and ladies at the home of A. Arthur Guilbert in 1895. A library association was founded the following year, which lobbied for a successful ballot referendum that provided city funding to the project. Some city philanthropists, including William Horlick, offered additional funding. The city's first public library, located in a room in the Secor Block, thus opened in September 1897. Almost immediately afterward, the library association began raising funds for a permanent library building in West Park, but their efforts were hampered when the City Council blocked that site from being developed. Meanwhile, the library's board sought the aid of Andrew Carnegie, who had recently funded the construction of hundreds of libraries in the United States, and he ultimately offered a donation of $50,000 in 1901.Stone, Fanny S. Racine, Belle City of the Lakes, S.J. Clarke, Racine, 1916. However, it was stipulated that the library offer $5,000 of its proceeds to the Carnegie Foundation each year of its operation. After contentious debate, the library board chose the southeast corner of Main and Seventh streets as the site for its new building. The site was purchased from Mary E. Hall in 1902. The farmhouse that formerly stood there was sold and moved.\\"Racine Heritage Museum (1904)\\", Preservation Racine, Inc. A number of plans for the building were submitted, and the one chosen was a design by John Mauran, a two-story stone and brick building in the Beaux-Arts style. With The plans were presented at the convention of the Western Library Association in August 1902, where it was declared \\"The Library Beautiful\\". The building's cornerstone was laid on May 30, 1903, in a ceremony featuring judge Charles E. Dyer. Construction was contracted to A.H. Harcus and Co., and it opened to the public unceremoniously on March 16, 1904. At the time of the library's opening, it held 97,000 books in its collection. Its ground floor featured two reading rooms, with a small auditorium and museum upstairs, and newspaper archives in the basement. Even this building, however, was insufficient before long, and the library was augmented with the opening of a branch in 1914, which had a higher circulation than the main building in the following year. Some of the library's collection was also housed in the libraries of the city's public schools. By 1929, the building had been called \\"outgrown\\",Herman, Bob. \\"Now It's 'Old Library': But In 1903 Hundreds of Persons Watched as Cornerstone was Laid\\", Racine Journal Times, May 18, 1958. and proposals for a replacement in 1934 were inspired by the New Deal's public works programs. Architects Kirchoff & Rose submitted a plan that year for a large five-story building on that site, which the PWA approved but which was never built.\\"Racine's New Temple of Books Will Look Like This\\", Racine Journal Times, December 31, 1934. Efforts to replace the Racine Public Library were renewed in 1954, with the city council approving the proposal to build in Memorial Park,\\"Request Park Site for New Library\\", Racine Journal Times, August 18, 1954. although cost concerns reduced the size of the planned building.\\"Rising Costs Will Cut Size of New Library, Council Told\\" (part 2), Racine Journal Times, June 28, 1956.

Over 75,000 books were moved from the old library to the new in a single day. Various uses were proposed for it, including making it part of the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìRacine campus or administrative offices for the Racine Unified School District. The Racine County Historical Society, then outgrowing its existing space in the county courthouse,4-Foot Umbrella of Crinoline Days Discovered Here, Racine Journal Times, November 13, 1934. held a campaign in 1960 to gain funding to buy the building.Dunn, Walter S., Jr. \\"Historical Museum Reflects Community Pride In Its Heritage\\", Racine Journal Times, September 25, 1960. The Racine County Museum opened May 18, 1962. The museum remained a separate entity from the Historical Society, with which it shared the building, until they merged in 1982. A large addition on the east side of the building was constructed in 1989. A proposal for an entirely new museum, known as \\"Discovery Place\\", received state and local funding in 2001, but was never built.Paulson, Chris. \\"Museum history starts small\\", Racine Journal Times, October 22, 2001.

He is currently the leader of the National United Party of Afghanistan, a small left-wing and secular party in Afghanistan that is a member of the National Coalition of Afghanistan. Ulumi previously served in the Afghan Army as a member of the Parcham faction of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan. during the Afghan Civil War (1989‚Äì1992), and left service with the rank of lieutenant general. Early life Ulumi was born on 15 August 1941 in Kandahar Province. His family were an important Pashtun family from the Barakzai Tribe. Military career Ulumi graduated from the University of Kabul magna cum laude in 1966.http://mehrwatan.com/?page_id=115 Ulumi was trained in both the United States and the Soviet Union.Afghan Biographies - Olumi, Noorulhaq Noor ul Haq Olomi Ulumi Afghan Civil War Ulumi saw action at the Battle of Jalalabad, where he played an important role in defeating the mujihadeen offensive. Following his success at Jalalabad he was given a new position as Governor of Kandahar. This is according to Peter Tomsen, but Tomsen is characteristically inaccurate. Ulumi was promoted to Kandahar governor in 1988 (see Mark Urban's \\"War in Afghanistan\\", written - unlike Tomsen's book - without political retrospective) and was still in Kandahar during the 1989 Jalalabad battle. The Jalalabad battle was actually led by Manokai Mangal and Asif Dilawar; Ulumi played no part though another Parchami interior minister, Hanif Atmar, was involved as an officer. =Governor of Kandahar= In his new role as governor, Ulumi enacted a number of major changes to regional government policy in order to help implement the Afghan Government's National Reconciliation. Firstly, he persuaded President Najibullah to withdraw Abdul Rashid Dostum's hated Jouzjani militia from Kandahar, he stopped forced conscription into the Army, he encouraged local unemployed youth to join his local paid militia to help defend Kandahar, he complied with prisoner release requests from moderate mujihadeen commanders, and he didn't interfere with the mujihadeen-run narcotics smuggling trade. Ulumi co-opted local mujahideen forces by providing them with incentives, such as money or permission to visit their families within Kandahar, in exchange for the mujahideen scaling down attacks on local government forces. In the case of Ahmed Gailani, Ulumi was related to the wife of Ahmed Gailani, due to her being a member of the Mohammadzai clan. As such he was able to reach out to and ease relations with Gailani's National Islamic Front of Afghanistan, inviting Gailani's son Hasan to Kandahar for negotiations. Ulumi was also able to reach out to Gul Agha Sherzai by emphasising their common Barakzai heritage as well as by offering financial incentives. Under a jointly agreed plan, Gul Agha would launch attacks on Kandahar Airport that had been pre-planned with Ulumi. Gul Agha's forces would fire off rockets and weapons at the airport, whilst forces under Ulumi would light fires and make loud noises. ISI forces observing the operation would then believe Gul Agha to be fighting the government, and would then supply him with weapons and food, which Ulumi allowed Gul Agha to sell within Kandahar. This made coordination of attacks between various mujahideen groups increasing difficult, although some groups such as Hezbi Islami refused any compromise with the Afghan government. Their refusal to compromise was in turn rewarded by funding from Pakistan, who made several failed attempts to unite the mujihadeen. During the Civil War, Ulumi also commanded the Afghan Army's Kandahar Corps. End of the conflict Ulumi, as commander of Afghan government forces in Kabul, surrendered Kabul in April 1992 to advancing mujahideen forces. After the conflict had ended Ulumi moved to the Netherlands, where lived in Landgraaf. He returned to Afghanistan after the overthrow of the Taliban in 2001. Political career Ulumi was elected as an MP for Kandahar Province in 2005, with 13,035 out of a total of 178,269 votes. The only candidate to receive a higher number of votes was Qayum Karzai, the elder brother of President Hamid Karzai, who received 14,243 votes. In 2010 Ulumi failed to be re-elected, failing to receive even 3,000 out of a total of 85,385 votes. There were also accusations of electoral fraud and vote rigging. During his term as an MP Ulumi chaired the Afghan Parliament's Defence Committee. He was nominated to be Minister of Interior by Abdullah Abdullah in the unity government of Ashraf Ghani in January 2015. He had supported Abdullah Abdullah in the 2014 Afghan presidential election. However, a ban was imposed by the Parliament on cabinet minister appointments with dual citizenship. After giving up his dual citizenship Ulumi was nominated again. He was confirmed as Interior Minister on 27 January 2015. Political views Ulumi maintains that the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan was only done at Afghanistan's behest, and that Soviet actions in the conflict were done in support of the Afghan government, who retained operational command. Ulumi also argues that during the rule of the PDPA, Afghans could approach the government and seek redress for issues free from corruption or tribalism. Ulumi has blamed the rise in Taliban activity in southern Afghanistan on the failure of the Afghan government to build a fair government, free from corruption. Personal life Ulumi's elder brother was a powerful general in President Najibullah's government and was assassinated by the mujaheddin. Ulumi speaks English and Russian fluently. Ulumi has two daughters and a son, all of whom live in the Netherlands.

The current Congolese army has its origins in the Force Publique that was active in the Belgian Congo, which was renamed the Congolese National Army (Arm√©e nationale congolaise, ANC) when the country gained independence from Belgium in 1960. During the regime of Mobutu Sese Seko, it was renamed the Armed Forces of Zaire (Forces Arm√©es Za√Øroises, FAZ) in 1971 with the country's name change from Congo to Zaire. Under Mobutu's leadership the FAZ was used to put down various rebellions but was deliberately kept weak to prevent any possible coup, resulting in its collapse in the face of Laurent Kabila's AFDL rebel movement during the First Congo War (1996‚Äì1997). After Kabila's overthrow of Mobutu the former FAZ troops and various rebels that supported him were in no condition to fight the invasion by Rwandan-backed militant groups during the Second Congo War (1998‚Äì2003) and largely collapsed. The peace agreement signed in 2002 initiated the process of uniting former rebel groups in a national army, the Forces du Terrestres of the FARDC, reorganizing them into multiple brigades. Although some progress has been made the army remains hampered by corruption as well as low and infrequent pay, which led to Land Forces troops committing numerous crimes against civilians. Since the end of the Second Congo War the army remains engaged with dozens of armed rebel groups throughout the country, most notably in the eastern province of North Kivu, near the border with Rwanda. There have also been multiple border clashes between Congolese troops and the Rwandan Army. History The land forces are made up of about 14 integrated brigades, of fighters from all the former warring factions which have gone through an brassage integration process (see next paragraph), and a not-publicly known number of non-integrated brigades which remain solely made up from single factions (the Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD)'s Armee National Congolaise, the ex-government former Congolese Armed Forces (FAC), the ex-RCD KML, the ex- Movement for the Liberation of Congo, the armed groups of the Ituri conflict (the Mouvement des R√©volutionnaires Congolais (MRC), Forces de R√©sistance Patriotique d'Ituri (FRPI) and the Front Nationaliste Int√©grationniste (FNI)) and the Mai-Mai). It appears that about the same time that Presidential Decree 03/042 of 18 December 2003 established the National Commission for Demobilisation and Reinsertion (CONADER), '..all ex-combatants were officially declared as FARDC soldiers and the then FARDC brigades [were to] rest deployed until the order to leave for brassage. The reform plan adopted in 2005 envisaged the formation of eighteen integrated brigades through the brassage process as its first of three stages.International Crisis Group, Security Sector Reform in the Congo, Africa Report No. 104, 13 February 2006, 17‚Äì18 The process consists firstly of regroupment, where fighters are disarmed. Then they are sent to orientation centres, run by CONADER, where fighters take the choice of either returning to civilian society or remaining in the armed forces. Combatants who choose demobilization receive an initial cash payment of US $110. Those who choose to stay within the FARDC are then transferred to one of six integration centres for a 45-day training course, which aims to build integrated formations out of factional fighters previously heavily divided along ethnic, political and regional lines. The centres are spread out around the country at Kitona, Kamina, Kisangani, Rumangabo and Nyaleke (within the Virunga National Park) in Nord-Kivu, and Luberizi (on the border with Burundi) in South Kivu. The process has suffered severe difficulties due to construction delays, administration errors, and the amount of travel former combatants have to do, as the three stages' centres are widely separated. Following the first 18 integrated brigades, the second goal is the formation of a ready reaction force of two to three brigades, and finally, by 2010 when MONUC is anticipated to have withdrawn, the creation of a Main Defence Force of three divisions. In February 2008, the current reform plan was described as:Retrieved 1 November 2008 > \\"The short term, 2008‚Äì2010, will see the setting in place of a Rapid > Reaction Force; the medium term, 2008‚Äì2015, with a Covering Force; and > finally the long term, 2015‚Äì2020, with a Principal Defence Force.\\" He added > that the reform plan rests on a programme of synergy based on the four > pillars of dissuasion, production, reconstruction and excellence. \\"The Rapid > Reaction Force is expected to focus on dissuasion, through a Rapid Reaction > Force of 12 battalions, capable of aiding MONUC to secure the east of the > country and to realise constitutional missions,\\" Defence Minister Chikez > Diemu said. Congolese troops in Ural-4320 trucks at the Kwanza-2010 exercises in Angola. Amid the other difficulties in building new armed forces for the DRC, in early 2007 the integration and training process was distorted as the DRC government under Kabila attempted to use it to gain more control over the dissident general Laurent Nkunda. A hastily negotiated verbal agreement in Rwanda saw three government FAC brigades integrated with Nkunda's former ANC 81st and 83rd Brigades in what was called mixage. Mixage brought multiple factions into composite brigades, but without the 45-day retraining provided by brassage, and it seems that actually, the process was limited to exchanging battalions between the FAC and Nkunda brigades in North Kivu, without further integration. Due to Nkunda's troops having greater cohesion, Nkunda effectively gained control of all five brigades - not what the DRC central government had been hoping!Henri Boshoff, The DDR Process in the DRC: a never- ending story, Institute for Security Studies, Pretoria, 2 July 2007 However, after Nkunda used the mixage brigades to fight the FDLR, strains arose between the FARDC and Nkunda-loyalist troops within the brigades and they fell apart in the last days of August 2007. The International Crisis Group says that 'by 30 August [2007] Nkunda's troops had left the mixed brigades and controlled a large part of the Masisi and Rutshuru territories' (of North Kivu).International Crisis Group, Bringing Peace to North Kivu, Africa Report No.133, 31 October 2007, p.13 Both formally integrated brigades and the non- integrated units continue to conduct arbitrary arrests, rapes, robbery, and other crimesAmnesty International, Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration (DDR) and the Reform of the Army], 25 January 2007, AI Index: AFR 62/001/2007 and these human rights violations are \\"regularly\\" committed by both officers and members of the rank and file. Members of the Army also often strike deals to gain access to resources with the militias they are meant to be fighting. The various brigades and other formations and units number at least 100,000 troops. The status of these brigades has been described as \\"pretty chaotic.\\" A 2007 disarmament and repatriation study said \\"army units that have not yet gone through the process of brassage are usually much smaller than what they ought to be. Some non-integrated brigades have only 500 men (and are thus nothing more than a small battalion) whereas some battalions may not even have the size of a normal company (over a 100 men).\\"Hans Romkena De Vennhoop Opportunities and Constraints for the Disarmament and Repatriation of Foreign Armed Groups in the DRC , Multi Country Demobilization and Recovery Program, April 2007, p.32 In 2015, three hundred FARDC special forces troops were deployed in northern Katanga to prevent inter-ethnic violence between Mbuti and Bantu locals.Special Forces of the Congo (FARDC) Deployed in Northern Katanga .

Sea World (Tilikum et al. v. Sea World Parks & Entertainment Inc., 842 F. Supp. 2d 1259 (S.D. Cal. 2012)) was a legal case heard in the US Federal Court in 2012 concerning the constitutional standing of an orca. It was brought by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) on behalf of Tilikum, an orca kept in the SeaWorld Orlando park, against the SeaWorld corporation. The plaintiff asked the court to rule that the terms of the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution applied to Tilikum, and thus that the orca's confinement amounted to involuntary servitude or slavery. The court held that the Thirteenth Amendment only applied to persons and that Tilikum was not a person, and so was not afforded constitutional protections.  Background  Tilikum was a bull killer whale (Orcinus orca) bought by the SeaWorld marine park in Orlando, Florida in 1992 to be part of the park's orca exhibit. He was the largest orca in captivity. The other whales named as plaintiffs in the suit are Katina, who is also kept in Orlando, and Corky, Kasatka, and Ulises who are kept in SeaWorld San Diego. A year prior to the case, Tilikum killed his handler and fellow performer, Dawn Brancheau. On February 24, 2010, Brancheau began her \\"Dine with Shamu\\" show with Tilikum just like she had many times before. However, this show ended by Tilikum reacting poorly to Dawn's request. While Brancheau interacted with Tilikum before a live audience, he grabbed Brancheau's ponytail (or arm, eyewitnesses disagree) and dragged her into the water. He held her at the bottom of the pool, ripping part of her scalp from her skull, breaking her jaw, fracturing vertebrae, and killing her. Tilikum was also one of three orcas that killed trainer Keltie Byrne in 1991, and in 1999 the dead body of an unauthorized intruder was found draped over his back.  Complaint  On 25 October 2011 animal rights organization PETA brought a constitutional lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California as next friends of the orcas. They asserted the wording of the US Constitution is not expressly limited to humans, and that orcas are entitled to protection under 13th Amendment. PETA said that the whales \\"were born free and lived in their natural environment until they were captured and torn from their families.\\" The complaint alleged the circumstances in which the whales are held results in them experiencing \\"extreme physiological and mental stress\\" and that their lifespans were shortened from \\"8.5 years in captivity versus up to 65 years in the wild.\\" The lawsuit asked the court to rule that the orcas were held in illegal involuntary servitude. SeaWorld called the action \\"baseless\\" and a \\"publicity stunt\\", and defended the treatment of orcas in its parks, saying \\"no facility sets higher standards in husbandry, veterinary care and enrichment\\".  The court‚Äôs decision  The court dismissed the action due to a lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Dismissing the petition after two days of hearings, US District Judge Jeffrey T. Miller wrote \\"As ‚Äòslavery‚Äô and ‚Äòinvoluntary servitude‚Äô are uniquely human activities, as those terms have been historically and contemporaneously applied, there is simply no basis to construe the Thirteenth Amendment as applying to non-humans\\".

Biography Friedlander was born in Oldenburg, Germany, but as a child moved to Charleston, South Carolina, where he spent his boyhood. In 1849, he moved to California during the gold rush. He had poor luck mining in Yuba County, but within a few years he went into mercantile trade and was able to corner the market on flour for the mining camps. Even that venture failed one time, but through his personal reputation for honesty in business he was able to maintain his credit and build the business back up. At the end of the Civil War, the economy in the United States re-stabilized and simultaneously California started to produce a surplus of wheat beyond the needs of west coast markets. Friedlander and other producers experimented with shipping to Pacific rim countries, but by coincidence weather-related crop failures in Great Britain created excess demand there. Although the British Isles were only accessible via a long, difficult trip around Cape Horn, Friedlander learned to take advantage of new technologies. One was a fast new clipper ship, called the Down Easter, which was particularly suited to cargo such as wheat, and could make the trip to England in about 100 days. He also utilized the telegraph, especially the newly laid trans-Atlantic telegraph, over which he was able to coordinate information about available vessels to ship the crop in a timely manner. Within a few years, California became a major supplier of flour and wheat to Great Britain. Friedlander built grain elevators and grist mills, employed the most modern large scale mechanized farming practices on the farms he owned, was a backer and promoter of California's first irrigation canal, and bought hundreds of thousands of acres of land in California's Central Valley. Beyond his business enterprises, Friedlander's involvement in public life included being water commissioner, one of the original regents of the University of California, and a several term vice-president and president of the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce. Friedlander was Jewish, part of a group of Jewish immigrants to the early Bay Area who considered the opportunities presented by the young state to be somewhat of a \\"promised land.\\" In personal descriptions, his biographers never fail to mention that he was a large man, 6 feet 7 inches. Friedlander and his South Carolina-born wife Priscilla were known for their parties in which they brought a flavor of \\"Old South\\" culture to San Francisco. At the time of his death, he was survived by five children. Friedlander had financial setbacks in 1877, related to a crop failure. In the summer of 1878 he died of a heart failure that some thought was brought on by the stress of managing his business on a day-to-day basis in general, and the crop failure in particular. However he left a legacy of business methods such that California wheat production remained a major industry for another twenty-five years.

Early life Epstein was born in Milwaukee to William Polacheck and Hilda Satt. She studied music at the University of Chicago and library science at the University of Illinois, graduating in 1943. She worked as a cataloguer at the latter institution while completing her degree, and upon graduation was appointed the Senior Music Librarian at Newark Public Library. In 1946 she began working as a cataloguer and reviser for the Library of Congress music section. After spending a period as a homemaker, she returned to the University of Chicago in 1964 as the Assistant Music Librarian, in which position she served for 22 years. Scholarship Beginning in 1955, Epstein began researching the historical origins of American slave music. Her 1977 book on the topic, Sinful Tunes and Spirituals: black folk music to the Civil War, was awarded the Chicago Folklore Prize and the Simkins Prize of the Southern Historical Association. Among other findings, Epstein demonstrated that the banjo emerged from the African slave tradition rather than rural white culture, a revelation that \\"shattered myths and sparked a remarkable revival of black string band music\\". Epstein received two National Endowment for the Humanities grants for her research, which was included in several musicology journals. She also published Music Publishing in Chicago Before 1871 (1969) and I Came a Stranger: The Story of a Hull-house Girl (1989), an edited autobiography of her mother. Legacy Epstein served as president of the Music Library Association (MLA) from 1977 to 1979, and was awarded the association's highest citation in 1986. MLA adjudicates a research award named after Epstein. Filmmaker Jim Carrier created The Librarian and the Banjo to document Epstein's contribution to American ethnomusicology. He noted that she \\"revolutionized our understanding of American music... we take for granted that African-American music is the tap root of popular American music. We owe much of that knowledge to this music librarian who set out to correct history\\". Epstein's papers and correspondence are held by Columbia College Chicago's Center for Black Music Research. Epstein also appeared in the PBS documentary program American Experience, \\"Chicago, City of the Century.\\" Her interview regarding her mother and conditions in the Near West Side Neighborhood at the turn of the 19th century appears on Disc 3: Battle for Chicago.

He is a member of the National Regeneration Movement party. He has been a Federal Congressman and a Senator of the Republic. On June 2 he became the winner of the electoral contest for the governorship of Baja California by the \\"Together We Will Make History\\" coalition in the 2019 state elections. On June 11, 2019, he was given the majority certificate with which he is credited as Governor-elect of Baja California and assumed office on November 15, 2019. Life Bonilla was born in Tijuana, Baja California and obtained his degree in business administration from the UNAM in 1983. He worked in a variety of companies, including Electrol de M√©xico, CONESA, and COVIMEX de M√©xico. Between 1982 and 1985, he directed the Potros de Tijuana baseball club, which played in the Liga Mexicana del Pac√≠fico. In 1984, he became the director general and a columnist of the Diario de Baja California newspaper, which began a career in media ownership for Bonilla. Through his company PSN (originally an acronym for Pacific Spanish Network, now Primer Sistema de Noticias), he directly operates XESS-AM 620 and XESDD-AM 1030 in Tijuana. He also owned XHENB-TV channel 29 in Ensenada, now a cable-only outlet, and his company Media Sports de M√©xico holds the concessions for two radio stations operated under brokerage agreements by American programmers, XEPE-AM 1700 and XHPRS-FM 105.7. Bonilla also acquired cable systems in Ensenada and Tecate. Bonilla also owned radio station KURS 1040 in San Diego through his company Quetzal Bilingual Communications; the station was sold in 2016 for $900,000. In 2000, Bonilla, then a dual citizen of Mexico and the United States, joined the board of the Otay Water District in Otay Mesa, California. While in the US, he was a donor to Republican causes and even was on the California finance committee for John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign. In March 2012, he announced his resignation from the water board in order to run for federal deputy and simultaneously join the 2012 presidential campaign of Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador. At the same time, he renounced his dual citizenship, a move necessary to meet the constitutional requirements to run for office. He became a proportional representation deputy on the PT list, during which time he served as the president of the Northern Border Matters Commission and was the state campaign coordinator for the PT in the 2013 Baja California state elections. Bonilla left the post in 2014 in order to become the state party director for the then-new Morena party. His relationship with L√≥pez Obrador remained close; in 2016, Bonilla invited him to his Petco Park suite for the 2016 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. Party members and leaders say that in Bonilla's media holdings, L√≥pez Obrador saw a \\"gold mine\\" to gain media exposure in Baja California. On 31 January 2018, L√≥pez Obrador announced that Bonilla would be the primary Senate candidate in Baja California for the Juntos Haremos Historia coalition, forming a ticket with Alejandra Le√≥n Gast√©lum. The Juntos Haremos Historia ticket took first place in the election, securing both candidates seats in the Senate. However, Bonilla has stated that he will only remain in office three months and will then become the state development coordinator in Baja California. Governor of Baja California Bonilla won the 2019 gubernatorial election and assumed office on November 15, 2019. The election law had been changed in 2014, mandating another election in 2021 in order to coincide with a Constitutional mandate that gubernatorial elections must coincide with federal elections. Insisting that this meant his term would end in 2024, Morena pushed for a referendum and a legal change. The referendum passed with 82% of the vote but only 1.9% citizen turnout; the so-called Ley Bonilla (Bonilla Law) was passed by the legislature after a thirty-minute debate. On May 11, 2020, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) ruled unanimously against the law, meaning Bonilla's term would run from November 1, 2019, to September 30, 2021. Bonilla was governor during the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico. As of May 13, 2020, there were 2,524 confirmed cases, 433 (23.9%) of which had ended in death. Two of the dead were two-month old babies. Tijuana was one of the most seriously affected cities in the country, with 1,216 reported cases on May 10 and 274 deaths. Mexicali had 942 cases and 96 deaths; Ensenada had 118 cases and 14 deaths (including one in San Quintin); Tecate reported 118 cases and 15 deaths; Rosarito Beach Municipality had 36 cases and 3 deaths. The first infection was reported on March 17 and April 10 had the highest report for a single day. Bonilla ordered non-essential businesses to close on March 31 and starting April 7 the state had a stay-at-home order, enforced through police checkpoints. Rent payments were suspended during April and May, and border crossings to and from the United States were limited. Despite stay-at-home orders, many factories continued to function, some after being closed by the state. Bonilla said they prefieren sacrificar a sus trabajadores antes que sus utilidades (\\"prefer to sacrifice their employees than their profits\\"). Among the companies cited were Clover (cell-phone repairs), Amphenol (fiber optics), Safran (commercial aircraft interiors), ABC Aluminium Solutions, TE Connectivity (electronics), and Turbotech.

Despite never contesting a Group One race she was the leading two-year-old filly in the United Kingdom in 1981 when she was unbeaten in three races including the Princess Margaret Stakes (by ten lengths) and the Lowther Stakes. She then developed injury problems and finished unplaced in her only appearance in 1982. Circus Ring later became a successful broodmare and was the direct female-line ancestor of the Hong Kong Horse of the Year Viva Pataca. She died in 2009 at the age of 30. Background Circus Ring was a dark-coated bay filly with no white markings, bred and owned by the Snailwell Stud of Newmarket, Suffolk. She was sired by High Top, who won the 2000 Guineas in 1972 and later became a successful breeding stallion. His other progeny included the St Leger Stakes winner Cut Above, the Oaks winner Circus Plume and the Prix du Jockey Club winner Top Ville. Circus Ring's dam Bell Song was a great-granddaughter of the 1000 Guineas winner Campanula, whose other descendants have included Athens Wood, Tony Bin, Dibidale (Irish Oaks), Vitiges (Champion Stakes) and Bolkonski. The filly was sent into training with Michael Stoute at his Freemason Lodge Stables in Newmarket and was ridden in all of her races by Walter Swinburn. Racing career=1981: two-year-old season On her racecourse debut, Circus Ring contested a division on the Princess Maiden Stakes over six furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse in July. She was always among the leaders and accelerated clear of the field in the last quarter mile to win easily by seven lengths from Wintergrace. Later in the month, the filly was moved up in class for the Group Three Princess Margaret Stakes over six furlongs at Ascot Racecourse. She started the 4/6 favourite against a field which included several highly regarded fillies including Fairy Tern, Atossa and Silojoka. She produced what Timeform described as \\"one of the most breathtaking displays by a two-year-old filly that we have seen in a long time\\", taking the lead approaching the final furlong and sprinting clear of the field to win by ten lengths. At York Racecourse on 19 August, Circus Ring started the 1/4 favourite for the Group Two Lowther Stakes, in which her rivals were headed by the Cherry Hinton Stakes winner Travel On. Circus Ring traveled very easily throughout the race and Swinburn spent the closing stages looking round for non-existent dangers. Her winning margin of two lengths from Travel On was described by Timeform as being an inadequate measure of her superiority over her opponents. Circus Ring was being prepared for a run in the Group One Cheveley Park Stakes when she fell lame in mid-September and was retired for the season. 1982: three- year-old season Circus Ring began the 1982 season as the clear favourite for the 1000 Guineas, despite doubts about her stamina and ability to recover from her injury of the previous season. Two weeks before the Newmarket classic she performed poorly in a training gallop and was withdrawn from the race. She eventually reappeared for the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot in June. She looked fit and well and ran well for much of the race but faded badly in the closing stages and finished last of the eight runners behind Chalon. Assessment In 1981, the independent Timeform organisation gave Circus Ring a rating of 122, making her the highest-rated two-year-old filly of the season. The experienced racing journalist Peter Willett compared Circus Ring's performances to those of Mumtaz Mahal and Myrobella. In the official International Classification she was rated the joint-best two-year-old filly in Europe, equal with the Fillies' Mile winner Height of Fashion and the French-trained Play It Safe. Stud record Circus Ring was retired from racing to become a broodmare at the Snailwell Stud before being exported to Australia in the mid 1990s by the Coolmore Stud. She produced no known foals after 1999 and died on 25 November 2009. Circus Ring's foals: *Douglas Fir (bay colt, foaled in 1984, sired by Busted) *Circus Act (bay filly, 1985, by Shirley Heights), dam of Brave Act (Solario Stakes, San Gabriel Handicap, Citation Handicap, Will Rogers Stakes, San Marcos Handicap) and Comic, the dam of Viva Pataca and Laughing (Flower Bowl Invitational Stakes) *Lady Shipley (bay filly, 1986, by Shirley Heights), won Lupe Stakes *Rainbow Ring (bay filly, 1987, by Rainbow Quest) *Royal Circus (bay colt, 1989, by Kris), won fifteen races *Finger of Light (bay filly, 1991, by Green Desert), won one race, grand-dam of Voila Ici (Premio Roma, Gran Premio di Milano) *Ellie Ardensky (bay filly, 1992, by Slip Anchor), won two races including the Listed Upavon Stakes *Cohiba (bay colt, 1993, by Old Vic), won three races *Slip The Net (bay colt, 1994, by Slip Anchor) *Rose of Tralee (bay filly, 1995, by Sadler's Wells), dam of Serenade Rose (VRC Oaks, AJC Oaks) *Florilegio (bay filly, 1996, by Danehill) *Danemarque (bay filly, 1997, by Danehill) *Wild Berries (bay filly, 1999, by Danehill) Pedigree *Circus Ring was inbred 4 x 4 to Dante, meaning that this stallion appears twice in the fourth generation of the pedigree.

Castle rocks of Grafendahn from the east. Foreground: the castle museum. Grafendahn Castle () lies in the southern Palatine Forest, the German part of the Wasgau region, just under 1 kilometre east of the small town of Dahn in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate.  Location  The rock castle of Grafendahn belongs to the group of castles at Dahn, which also includes Altdahn and Tanstein. Although the three castles are sited next to one another on a rocky ridge, they were not built at the same time. A similar type of castle arrangement is also found e. g. in the nearby French Vosges in the upper Alsace where there is a cluster of three castles at Husseren.  History  Grafendahn was built in 1287 by Conrad of Mursel, who was a Lehnsmann or vassal of the bishops of Speyer and a nephew of Frederick of Dahn (see Altdahn). The castle was conceived from the outset as a so-called Ganerbenburg - a castle in which several families or family lines lived and worked at the same time. As early as 1288, there were five other heirs, besides Conrad Mursel, who included the counts of Sponheim. In 1339, Count John II of Sponheim purchased all parts of the site from the various parties concerned (including William of Winstein, Conrad Mursel's son-in-law) and thus became the sole owner. In 1425, the castle defences were strengthened and, in 1437, when the House of Sponheim became extinct on the death of John V, it was transferred by inheritance treaty into the possession of the margraves of Baden. However its defences were not robust enough to withstand a siege by Prince Elector Frederick the Victorious; in 1462 he took the castle and had it slighted. It was clearly not rebuilt in a systematic way. In 1480 Hans von Trotha, who was already the liegeman of Berwartstein Castle, was also given Grafendahn as a fief by the prince elector, and took full ownership in 1485 through purchase. Nevertheless, around 1500, the castle was described as \\"uninhabitable\\". Until 1637 the ruined castle belonged to the lords of Fleckenstein. In 1642 it changed hands again and was acquired by the tavern at Waldenburg, where it remained for about 150 years. In 1793 the site went back to the Bishopric of Speyer as Lehnsherr (liege lord), who did not enfeoff it again.  Site  Grafendahn Castle is the smallest of the three Dahn castles and is located on the middle of the five castle rock outcrops. The development of the upper ward (the Oberburg) is rather unclear today due to its modern parapet walls. In the west of the upper ward are the striking ruins of a shield wall, that was erected facing Tanstein Castle. Parts of it have survived at its original height. It was built of rusticated ashlars. Against the shield wall there was a small palas as well as several domestic buildings. In the lower ward (the Unterburg), which is situated on two narrow rock terraces, several chambers, cattle troughs and a well shaft have survived. The castle museum has been house in a restored stable block since 1987.  Literature  * Stefan Grathoff: Die Dahner Burgen. Alt-Dahn ‚Äì Grafendahn ‚Äì Tanstein. Guidebook 21.

Its fourth course is tuned to an octave while the remaining courses are tuned in unisons. The instrument can be either finger picked or plucked with a plectrum. It was invented in October 1962 by Lyle Mayfield of Greenville, Illinois.Daily Illini (University of Illinois), Saturday, November 10, 1962, p. 1 Daily Illini (University of Illinois), Friday, September 20, 1963, p. 9 Daily Illini (University of Illinois), Friday, August 04, 1972, p. 4] The guitalin is a non-traditional, hybrid folk instrument, as it incorporates features of multiple traditional folk instruments into one. While the original tuning consisted of a G chord in root position, the standard tuning of the guitalin which was adopted is a C chord in second inversion. Another common tuning is a second inversion G chord. The timbre or tone quality of the guitalin can be described as a combination between a banjo and a mandolin, while the name of the instrument is derived from the combination of the names of the guitar and mandolin. The shape of the body of the instrument is an elongated trapezoid about the length of a standard guitar body. From the time it was invented until Lyle's death in 2012, there was much experimentation with several configurations of instruments based on the guitalin and guinjo (another of Lyle's inventions). Among these experiments were the fretted fiddle or \\"friddle\\" or \\"guiddle\\", an 8-string fiddle, the dobrolin, the triplin (an instrument Lyle disliked, recorded once, then scrapped), an electric (solid body) guitalin, and even a full-sized, upright guitalin bass. Other notable Mayfield instruments include the guinjo (1974), a bass mandolin (1974), the Coffee Can Lid Banjo (1974), a Commodophone (a spoof instrument using a toilet seat for a top), the Echo Guitar (1992), the Mayfield Guitar (1998), the Mariachi bass (1998), a variation on the hard-top banjo (2006), the Mayfield Pear Guitars (2005), a variation on the Manjo (2006), the Round Cornered Guitalin (Martin Smith, 2006), the Round Head Guitars (Martin Smith, 2007), and variations on the Mandola (2008) and the Dreadnought Guitar (2008).  Tuning  There are several ways a guitalin is tuned. The most common tuning is a second inversion C chord with the courses of 2 adjacent strings tuned in unison with the lowest course (4th course) tuned an octave apart. This common tuning is GCEG. * fourth course (lowest tone of 4th course): G3 ( Hz), fourth course (highest tone of 4th course): G4 ( Hz) * third course: C4 ( Hz) * second course: E4 ( Hz;) * first course: G4 ( Hz) Secondary Tuning (original tuning): * fourth course (lowest tone of 4th course): G3 ( Hz), fourth course (highest tone of 4th course): G4 ( Hz) * third course: B3 ( Hz) * second course: D4 ( Hz;) * first course: G4 ( Hz) Other tunings used in recordings include a root position G chord, and root position F chord, and even the standard ukulele tuning of G-C-E-A.

Lyle was known for designing and building hybrid folk instruments which combined two or three instrument features into a single instrument.The Walnut Valley Occasional, Record Reviews, December, 1976 In Lyle's personal writings discovered after his death, he describes the origins of the guitalin as follows: > \\"I decided to build a toy instrument for him to play with. In my workshop I > had some 1/4‚Äù mahogany wall paneling, some banjo parts, some mandolin parts, > and some pine wood from a packing crate. From these components I fashioned a > simple instrument that was somewhat wedge-shaped. Using a mandolin set of > machine heads and a mandolin bridge I strung it with four sets of duals over > a guitar sized fingerboard. While building the instrument, I realized that > if I just left it untuned my small son would be beating on a dischordant set > of strings. I decided to tune it to an open chord...G.\\" Lyle goes on further to say in his writings that \\"when [he] tuned the instrument up the sound was so impressive [he] decided to keep it as a working instrument. It was at that time that Layne lost his instrument.\\" A few notable folk musicians have played the instrument and have found it noteworthy. Among these are Jimmy Driftwood (composer of \\"The Battle of New Orleans\\" and \\"Tennessee Stud\\"),The First Annual Arkansas Folk Festival Recorded in Mountain View, AR April 19‚Äì20, 1963, links 35-36 Grammy Award winner Doc Watson and The Bray Brothers, who featured the Mayfield guitalin on their album \\"Prairie Bluegrass\\" on the tune \\"Barbara Allen\\" from the label Rounder Records, originally recorded in 1962 for WHOW radio in Clinton, Illinois. Recordings of these musicians with the guitalin can be found on the \\"history\\" page at the Mayfield Music Company website. Collection of Mayfield instruments, April 1980 In the 1960s, Lyle and Doris Mayfield were involved in the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Campus Folksong Club and were associated with Archie Green during that time. In the mid-1960s, Lyle was credited for bringing the native music of Illinois to the Campus Folksong Club and appeared on recordings that the club produced, including the \\"Green Fields of Illinois\\" record.Introduction to the Campus Folksong Club, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Daily Illini (University of Illinois), Friday, November 19, 1965, p. 4Daily Illini (University of Illinois), Saturday, February 22, 1964, p. 7 Daily Illini (University of Illinois), Wednesday, February 19, 1964, p. 4 He and Doris regularly appeared in performances held by the Folksong Club, commonly referred to as \\"folk sings\\".Daily Illini (University of Illinois), Friday, November 09, 1962, p. 11 .Daily Illini (University of Illinois), Saturday, February 22, 1964, p. 1 Daily Illini (University of Illinois), Friday, October 4, 1963, p. 3 They also volunteered their time and talents to perform for other events and venues.The Greenville Advocate, Thursday, August 31, 1972 In 1976, Lyle and Doris Mayfield, along with their son Layne, were invited by the Smithsonian Institution to represent Southern Illinois at the American Bicentennial Smithsonian Folklife Festival.The Greenville Advocate, August 21, 1980, p. 15 It was at this event that they had a good opportunity to showcase some of their unique folk instruments; namely the guitalin and guinjo. Throughout most of the 1970s, the Mayfields devoted much time to preserving traditional southern Illinois music and folklore. Additionally, they were the founders and principle sponsors of the annual Southern Illinois Folk Convention in the early 1970s.The Greenville Advocate, Thursday, March 23, 1972 The craft of building the instruments was passed on to younger members of the family who continue to produce them out of both Greenville, Illinois and Dallas, Texas. Martin Smith of Greenville, Illinois and Nathan Smith (Lyle Mayfield's youngest grandson) of Plano, Texas are co-owners of Mayfield Music Company. As a team, they continue to improve upon the original Mayfield designs and are currently in the process of preparing new hybrid folk instrument designs for release starting in mid-to-late 2014.  Modern Use  In the summer of 2013, the instrument was discovered by indie folk musician Sufjan Stevens, who contacted Nathan Smith, current owner of Mayfield Music Company, to inquire about having one built for him. On March 31, 2015, Sufjan released his album, Carrie & Lowell, which features two Mayfield guitalins.Pitchfork, Monday, February 16, 2015 In April 2015, Sufjan began his tour for the album, and the guitalins made an appearance in this tour. This marks the first use of a guitalin on a major record since 1964, when The Bray Brothers featured one on their song, \\"Barbara Allen\\", from their album \\"Prairie Bluegrass\\", released under Rounder Records.

Kennedy. The film reconstructs the assassination with both Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson present, both before and after the event. The roles in Since are performed by Warhol's \\"superstars\\" from The Factory. The film is based on the media coverage of the assassination and the speeches of Johnson, who succeeded Kennedy as President of the United States. The film is 67 minutes long, and shot on 16 mm film in color. It has been described as unfinished. Background Warhol had been unmoved by the Kennedy assassination, commenting that he wasn't bothered that he was dead, but was bothered by \\"...the way the television and radio were programming everybody to feel so sad. It seemed like no matter how hard you tried, you couldn't get away from the thing.\\" Warhol had already created the silkscreen paintings Sixteen Jackies, Nine Jackies, Jackie (The Week That Was) and Gold Jackie of Jacqueline Kennedy, and explored the reporting of the assassination in a series of eleven prints, Flash - November 22, 1963. Plot The film begins with a close up of Ondine, with an off-screen voice saying that the film will follow the \\"Oswald model on television\\". The voice adds that \\"First it happened, then it was played back in tape, and then it was played back in slow motion.\\" The voice also says that the performers don't have to maintain \\"stiff character portrayals\\" and are free to assume other roles, assuming they have \\"assumed that role by choice originally.\\" The voice says that the setting of the film is not in Dallas, a fact immediately contradicted by Ondine, playing Lyndon Johnson. Ondine indicates that Ingrid Superstar is Jacqueline Kennedy, after initially assuming that he himself was President Kennedy in confusion. Ondine announces his intention to hire assassins, and Gerard Malanga and Ronnie Cutrone appear as assassins. In planning the assassination Ondine fails to remember the street on which it occurred, before saying that \\"I don't know, I didn't even see it.\\" Playing Kennedy, Mary Woronov waves a large sheet of red paper, indicating that she has been shot. Malanga then shoots Woronov with a banana, causing Ondine to exclaim that he was \\"a little late\\". Ondine then reads a speech to the American people. The assassination is then restaged, with Malanga shooting Woronov, and the camera zooming in on the red paper blood. Ingrid Superstar asks \\"Who got shot?\\" before playing with Richard Rheem's hair. Susan Bottomly, playing Jacqueline Kennedy, leaps over a couch, which acts as the car in the Presidential motorcade. Bottomly is asked to leap again in slow motion, and the sound cuts out. Ronnie Cutrone then shoots Woronov, in pretend slow motion, the camera again focuses on the crumpled paper blood. Ondine tells Ingrid Superstar to be Lady Bird Johnson, the new First Lady of the United States, and is annoyed that she is not taking her role seriously. The War on Poverty is mentioned, and Superstar says that \\"We should omit poverty and paranoia.\\" A man wearing a red shirt then portrays President Kennedy, and lies in a pool of blood. The TV show You Are There is referenced, and after someone mentions that they are on their way to the hospital, Ondine says of Kennedy that \\"He's dead\\". Cutrone, eating a banana, and Malanga, are taken by Secret Service agents through a passageway, and Malanga is shot. They are told to do it again as it wasn't a traumatic situation, and wouldn't \\"shock the world for four days\\". Cutrone then portrays Lee Harvey Oswald, and Malanga, playing Jack Ruby, shoots him with a banana. The shooting is then restaged, Cutrone falls to his knees with reporters trying to interview him. Ruby is taken away. Cutrone smokes a cigarette, and a voice announces that this is the \\"slow motion version\\", but the \\"regular rapid-motion version\\" will have to be done.\\" An inflatable Baby Ruth chocolate bar then appears. The participants in Since wave to the camera at the start of the second reel of film. Ondine says \\"There's Neiman Marcus\\", to which Susan Bottomly, playing Jacqueline Kennedy says \\"Oh, Hi\\". While the participants in the Presidential motorcade are discussing whether to have the top of the car down, Kennedy is shot by Oswald, and the camera zooms in and out on the crumpled red paper, and finally focuses on Ivy Nicholson's red stockings. Ondine then compliments Bottomly, calling her the \\"loveliest first lady we've ever had, outside of Abigail van Buren\\", and then an inflatable Baby Ruth bar is delivered as a message. The camera then quickly moves around while it is explained that President Kennedy has been shot. Ondine complains that the other characters are \\"absolutely boring\\", but praises Woronov claiming she \\"may have been the most interesting person here.\\" Ondine then addresses the other participants, telling them to \\"keep attention away from Jack\\" and \\"play a kind of vague scene\\". Ondine then insults others and shouts \\"What the hell is the matter with you people?.\\" Ondine then argues with Nicholson, but Malanga and Cutrone rush on and drop two inflatable Baby Ruth bars on the performers. The camera then blurs and Malanga and Cutrone reappear and beat the participants with the Baby Ruth bars. A voice announces that Oswald is being transferred from prison, and Malanga and Cutrone are shown with whips. Malanga and Cutrone congratulate Ondine on becoming president, and then Malanga as Jack Ruby shoots Cutone playing Oswald. A press conference is enacted, and Ondine imitates Edward R. Murrow to say thank you and good night. Malanga walks around the set cracking his whip, and then asks Ondine if he has \\"anything to get high with\\". The film ends after Cutrone kicks the inflatable Baby Ruth bar in the air several times. Cast *Ondine - Lyndon B. Johnson *Ingrid Superstar - Jacqueline Kennedy/Lady Bird Johnson *International Velvet - Jacqueline Kennedy *Mary Woronov - John F. Kennedy *Richard Rheem - John Connally *Gerard Malanga, Ronnie Cutrone - alternating the roles of Lee Harvey Oswald/Jack Ruby *Ivy Nicolson *Randy Bourscheidt *Walter Dainwood *Henry Geldzahler Reception J. J. Murphy, in his 2012 book The Black Hole of the Camera: The Films of Andy Warhol, wrote that Since \\"seems so heavily reliant on improvisation that at times it loses any clear sense of direction\\", and added that the film was quite \\"comedic\\". Murphy added that the participants in the film appeared to be \\"confused about events\\". Murphy says that Since shows the inability of a theatrical event to hold people's interest as it cannot deploy the same techniques that television does. Murphy concludes his analysis by saying that Warhol's restaging of the assassination was not as a historical event but thanks to television, as the \\"media spectacle it truly was.\\" See also *List of American films of 1966 *Andy Warhol filmography ReferencesExternal links * Category:1966 films Category:Films directed by Andy Warhol Category:Films about the assassination of John F.

In this anthology, various young authors from different latitudes come together under the influence of Stephen King and pay tribute to the ‚Äúmaster of horror‚Äù. These stories prove that supernatural horror is not a tradition alien to Spanish American literature but is an interest of a generation of writers. The ghost of King looms over these stories, sometimes like Pennywise, others like an arcane being from the beyond where reality shows coexist with zombies. Inspired by the North American writer, the stories gate crash meetings of psychiatric patients, discover supernatural beings infiltrating Latin American military movements, narrate spontaneous experiments in quantum physics and present obscure characters, such as evil doppelgangers or demons that stalk innocent children. Welcome, reader, to this disturbing homage: here there is cannibalism, madness and religious sects. Here there are tigers.

The twelve pictorial stained-glass works depicting scenes from the life of Jesus were installed gradually from 1909 to 1959.

The living animals would have superficially resembled modern-day needlefish or houndfish. As per the family, the trunk shield is short. The genus is distinguished from other members of the family in that the plates are very thin, and the dermal surface is typically covered in small, closely packed tubercles. The genus was originally placed in its own family, but was then later determined to be closely related to Brachydeirus and Synauchenia, and was then merged into the family Brachydeiridae. Species=O. rostratus The type species is the smaller of the two described species. It has a stout, triangular shaped rostrum, and very small tubercles. O. rostratus differs from O. magnus in that the former has a short antero-ventral process on its anterior lateral plate, and has a long and narrow anterior ventro-lateral plate. Skull lengths range from 11 to 13 cm. O. magnus O. magnus is the larger of the two described species from Bad Wildungen; the skull length of the holotype is 18 cm long. In addition to size, O. magnus differs from O. rostratus by having a very thin, needle-like rostrum, an anterior lateral plate with a long antero-ventral process, and a broad and short anterior ventro-lateral plate. O. sp. This unnamed species is based on an incomplete median dorsal plate suggestive of Oxyosteus. The plate was found in the Middle Frasnian portion of the Late Devonian strata of the Holy Cross Mountains in Poland.

A Lutheran church since the Reformation, the church is of particular historical and architectural interest. Detail of Gothic steeple Pipe organ The name The Church is mentioned for the first time in 801, when it is referred to as the church of Saint Maurice. The name of Saint Aurelia appears only in 1324, when there is a reference to the Church of Saint Maurice \\"commonly called Saint Aurelia\\". The change in name seems to be a response to a popular movement, since the church was known locally as Sainte Aur√©lie long before the name was officially changed. It is probably linked to the cult of Aurelia of Strasbourg. According to the legend, the Church stands on the site of the tomb of Aurelia. The Reformation In 1524, at the beginning of the Reformation, Martin Bucer was appointed as extra pastor of the church by the guild of gardeners, the largest guild in Strasbourg. He joined Symphorien Pollio, with whom the gardeners were less than happy. The Chapter of St Thomas had at first refused the appointment, scandalised by Bucer's marriage and excommunication. The gardeners then appealed to the City Council, who forced the Chapter of St Thomas to accept Bucer. Bucer preached his first sermon there on 24 February 1524, and quickly rose to become the leader of the reform in Strasbourg. He stayed at St. Aurelia's until 1531. One of the first results of his arrival was the opening of the tomb where the remains of Aurelia were supposed to lie and the removal of the bones by the gardeners, with Bucer justifying this on the grounds that the tomb had become an object of idolatry. Soon afterwards he began the removal of images from St Aurelia's and other Strasbourg churches. New church Due to structural weaknesses, the church was completely rebuilt in the 18th century, the new church being inaugurated in 1765. The Church is notable for its Baroque interior, which includes a white and gold altar. The galleries are decorated with twenty-three biblical scenes by the Strasbourg painter Pierre Joseph No√´l, painted in 1767. The church possesses the oldest bell in Strasbourg, dating from 1410, as well as a bell-tower clock dating from 1845 by Jean-Baptiste Schwilgu√©, the creator of the third astronomical clock of Strasbourg Cathedral. It is the only Schwilgu√© bell-tower clock that is still functioning. The church is owned and used by a congregation within the Protestant Church of Augsburg Confession of Alsace and Lorraine. In 1988 the Church was listed as a French heritage site (Monument historique). Organ The Church is also known for its 1718 Andreas Silbermann organ, on which Albert Schweitzer produced some recordings of Bach and Franck in 1936 for Columbia. Battle of Austerlitz In 1805 and early 1806 the Church was used to house Austrian and Russian prisoners, some of the 70,000 prisoners of war taken by the French after the Battle of Austerlitz. 21st century parish The current pastor, since 2012, is Petra Magne de la Croix.

Relatively rare in occurrence, this condition is benign, but presents as hard, indurated and enlarged masses that are clinically indistinguishable from salivary gland neoplasms or tumors. It is now regarded as a manifestation of IgG4-related disease. Involvement of the submandibular glands is also known as K√ºttner's tumor, named after Hermann K√ºttner (1870-1932), a German Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeon, who reported four cases of submandibular gland lesions for the first time in 1896. Presentation The inflammatory lesions in K√ºttner's tumor may occur on one side (unilateral) or both sides (bilateral), predominantly involving the submandibular gland, but is also known to occur in other major and minor salivary glands, including the parotid gland. Overall, salivary gland tumors are relatively rare, with approximately 2.5‚Äì3 cases per 100,000 people per year seen in the Western world; however, salivary gland malignancies account for 3‚Äì5% of all head and neck cancers. However, salivary tumors show a great deal of morphological diversity, as well as variations in the nature of the lesion (malignant vs. benign): approximately 20% to 25% of parotid tumors, 35% to 40% of submandibular tumors, and more than 90% of sublingual gland tumors are malignant. This situation underscores the diagnostic challenges in respect of K√ºttner's tumor; despite being benign, this condition mimics the clinical appearance of malignancy in the salivary gland. The swollen masses of K√ºttner's tumor are generally painful, and patients are advised surgical resection (known as 'sialadenectomy') of a part or whole of the glandular tissue upon suspicion of possible malignancy. It is only upon post-surgical histopathology of the excised mass that the diagnosis of K√ºttner's tumor is definitively made. Histological features The histopathological features that characterize K√ºttner's tumor include: * Heavy infiltration of the glandular tissue by lymphocytes (predominantly activated B-cells and helper T-cells) as well as plasma cells (collectively known as 'Lymphoplasmacytic Infiltrate'). * Presence of reactive lymphoid follicles in the infiltrate, marked by a lack of atypical lymphoid cells (this is in sharp contrast to the presentations in lymphoma). * Atrophy and loss of acini (groups of secretory cells found in the salivary glands). * Encasement of the glandular ducts in thick fibrous tissues, as a result of chronic presence of inflammatory infiltrate in that area - a condition known as periductal fibrosis. * Eventual periductal and interlobular (inside the gland) sclerosis (replacement of regular tissue with hard connective tissue). Pathogenesis The cause and pathogenesis of this chronic condition are not very well understood. Several factors have been postulated: * Formation of a hard salivary calculus or sialolith by accumulation of calcium salts in the duct of the salivary gland (a process known as Sialolithiasis). This has been proposed as the most common cause for K√ºttner's tumor of the submandibular gland, with sialoliths observed in an appreciable proportion of cases. However, sialolith involvement may not be found in many cases. * Abnormalities of the salivary gland ducts leading to excessive accumulation or retention of ductal secretions, which can excite chronic inflammations. * Immune, especially autoimmune, cause \\\\- which has gained steam, given the observation that the tissue of the glands is overrun with lymphoid immune cells and fibrous connective tissue, as well as corroboration from markedly similar lesions (with histologic and immunohistochemical findings) seen elsewhere in the body. The presence of abundant Immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) associated with Plasma cells infiltrating into the salivary glands, as well as increased serum IgG4 concentration, has been noted with patients with K√ºttner's tumor. This chronic condition is primarily observed in adult (40‚Äì70 years) patients. However, K√ºttner's tumor, with prominent immunopathological features, has been described in an 11-year- old boy in Brazil in 2012. Diagnosis Given the difficulties of a definitive pre-operative diagnosis, the clinical entity of K√ºttner's tumor has so far remained significantly under-reported and under-recognized. In recent times, armed with a better understanding of the occurrences and observable features of this condition, surgeons are increasingly depending upon pre- operative ultrasonography along with Fine-needle aspiration cytological (FNAC) examinations to make an accurate presumptive diagnosis, and according to one estimate, about 44% of patients undergoing submandibular resection are found to have this condition. In the ultrasonogram, K√ºttner's tumor is characterized by a diffuse, heterogeneous zone of echo-shadows. The FNAC finds cells greatly reduced in number (called 'paucicellularity') along with scattered tubular ducts against a backdrop of lymphoplasmacytic infiltration and fibrous depositions. There may be a reduced but moderate number of cells and ducts enveloped in fibrous sheaths, as well as fibrous proliferation of the gland's septa. The cytologic findings by themselves may not be specific, and the diagnosis requires adjunct consideration of both the ultrasonogram and clinical presentation. Application of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been tried to non-invasively examine the morphological variations in K√ºttner's tumor and differentiate them from those seen in malignant tumors; while MRI findings of the affected tissue and the pattern of cellular infiltration may offer some diagnostic clues for this condition, so far the results have been inconclusive. Existing treatment Standard, and most effective, therapy to date is glandular sialadenectomy, which is associated with fairly low operative morbidity; however, in recent times, the administration of steroid (which can shrink the inflammatory lesion and is known to reduce serum IgG4 values) has been considered favorably, and may be useful in younger patients or those who refuse surgery.

It is greyish in color with a distinct mid-lateral band, and a rather slender shape. It feeds mainly on smaller fish. This species can reach a length of SL. The population of the species has declined due to the introduction of the Nile perch in the 1950s. It has not been recorded since 1980 and the IUCN lists it as \\"Critically Endangered\\" and considers it may already be extinct. This fish is named in honour of the Swedish naturalist, Carl Linnaeus. Description Haplochromis vonlinnei is a moderate-sized, slender cichlid with an acute snout, slightly protruding lower jaw and curved teeth. It is a greyish color with a narrow, intermittent blackish dorsal-lateral band and a broader, more distinct mid-lateral band. The flanks are yellowish and the belly white. In the male, the anal fin is grey with two to four bright orange circular spots with thin white rims (egg dummies). In the female, the anal fin is yellowish with two darker yellow spots. Haplochromis vonlinnei ranges in size from . Among other fish in the genus Haplochromis found in Lake Victoria, it is similar in shape to H. pyrrhopteryx but differs in colouring as that species lacks a mid-lateral band. It also resembles H. altigenis in morphology, but that species has a differently shaped head and less-curved teeth. Distribution and habitat Haplochromis vonlinnei is endemic to Lake Victoria where it is known from the Mwanza Gulf region in Tanzania. It is presumed to be a demersal fish and is found near the lakebed over muddy substrates at depths between . Status The Nile perch (Lates niloticus) was introduced into Lake Victoria in the 1950s with the objective of making the lake fisheries more productive. It is a fish-eating predator and since its introduction, many species of cichlid in the genus Haplochromis have suffered significant declines in number, and Haplochromis vonlinnei is one of these. The fish was already uncommon in the 1970s, and it has not been recorded since 1980, when several specimens were caught by trawling during a survey undertaken by Tanzania. The IUCN has listed Haplochromis vonlinnei as being \\"Critically Endangered\\" and suggests it is either exceedingly rare with very few individuals remaining, or may already be extinct. Another factor that may affect any remaining fish is the diminished clarity of the water which may make mate recognition more difficult.

Under these conditions, the droplet will periodically deform between prolate and oblate ellipsoidal shapes. The characteristic frequency and magnitude of the deformation is determined by a balance of electrodynamic, hydrodynamic, and capillary stresses acting on the droplet interface. This phenomenon has been studied extensively both mathematically and experimentally because of the complex fluid dynamics that occur. Characterization and modulation of electrodynamic droplet deformation is of particular interest for engineering applications because of the growing need to improve the performance of complex industrial processes(e.g. two-phase cooling,Kaji NN, Mori YH, Tochitani YY. Electrically Induced Shape Oscillation of Drops as a Means of Direct-Contact Heat Transfer Enhancement: Part 2‚ÄîHeat Transfer. J. Heat Transfer. 1988;110(3):700-704. crude oil demulsification). The primary advantage of using oscillatory droplet deformation to improve these engineering processes is that the phenomenon does not require sophisticated machinery or the introduction of heat sources. This effectively means that improving performance via oscillatory droplet deformation is simple and in no way diminishes the effectiveness of the existing engineering system.  Motivation  The heat transfer dynamics in two-phase two component flow systems are governed by the dynamic behavior of droplets/bubbles that are injected into the circulating coolant stream.S. Mostafa Ghiaasiaan. Two-Phase Flow, Boiling, and Condensation: In Conventional and Miniature Systems. 2008. Cambridge University PressTakaaki Mochizuki. Periodic Deformation of Microsize Droplets in a Microchannel Induced by a Transverse Alternating Electric Field. Langmuir 2013 29 (41) The injected bubbles/droplets are typically of a lower density than the coolant and thus experience an upward buoyancy force. They enhance the thermal performance of cooling systems because as they float upwards in heated pipes the coolant is forced to flow around the bubbles/droplets. The secondary flow around the droplets modifies the coolant flow creating a quasi- mixing effect in the bulk fluid that increases the heat transfer from the pipe walls to the coolant. Current two-component, two-phase cooling systems such as nuclear reactors, control the cooling rate by optimizing solely the coolant type, flow rate, and bubble/droplet injection rate. This approach modifies only bulk flow settings and does not provide engineers the option of control of directly modulating the mechanisms that govern the heat transfer dynamics. Inducing oscillations in the bubbles/droplets is a promising approach to improving convective cooling because creates secondary and tertiary flow patterns that could improve heat transfer without introducing significant heat to the system. Electrodynamic droplet deformation also of particular interest in crude oil processing as a method to improve the separation rate of water and salts from the bulk. In its unprocessed form, crude oil cannot be used directly in industrial processes because the presence of salts can corrode heat exchangers and distillation equipment. To avoid fouling due to these impurities it is necessary to first remove the salt, which is concentrated in suspended water droplets. Exposing batches of crude oil to both DC and AC high-voltage electric fields induces droplet deformation that ultimately causes the water droplets to coalesce into larger droplets. Droplet coalescence improves the separation rate of water from crude oil because the upward velocity of a sphere is proportional to the square of the sphere‚Äôs radius. This can be easily shown by considering gravitational force, buoyancy, and Stokes flow drag. It has been reported that increasing both the amplitude and frequency of the applied electric fields can significantly increases water separation up to 90%.Byoung-Yun Kim, Jun Hyuk Moon, Tae-Hyun Sung, Seung-Man Yang, Jong-Duk Kim.

Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences. to internal and external flow of a sphere induced by an electric field was the first to provide an argument that accounted for pressure induced by fluid flow both inside the droplet and in the external fluid field. Unlike some of his contemporaries, Taylor argued that surface tension and a uniform internal pressure could not balance the spatially varying normal stress on a droplet interface that was resulted from the presence of a steady, uniform electric field. He posited that in order for a droplet interface to remain in a non-deformed state in the presence of an electric field, there must be fluid flow both inside and outside the droplet interface. He developed a solution for the internal and external flow field using a streamfunction approach similar to that of creeping flow past a sphere.Pijush K. Kundu, Ira M. Cohen. Fluid Mechanics. 2010. Academic Press Taylor confirmed the validity of his solution by comparing it to images from flow visualization studies that observed circulation both inside and outside the droplet interface.  Torza's solution  Torza's 1971 solutionS. Torza, R. G. Cox, and S. G. Mason \\"Electrohydrodynamic Deformation and Burst of Liquid Drops\\" Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. A February 18, 1971 269 1198 295-319 for droplet deformation under the presence of a uniform, time-varying electric field is the most widely reference model for predicting small amplitude droplet deformations. Similar to the solution developed by Taylor, Torza developed a solution for electrodynamic droplet deformation by considering fluid circulation both inside and outside of a droplet interface. His solution is innovative because it derives an expression for the instantaneous droplet deformation ratio by considering separate sub-problems to derive the effects of electric stress, internal hydrodynamic stress, external hydrodynamic stress, and the surface tension on the droplet interface. The droplet deformation ratio D is a quantity that expresses the relative extension and shortening of the vertical and horizontal dimensions of a sphere. D = \\\\frac{d_1-d_2}{d_1+d_2} The electric stress sub-problem is formulated by defining electric potential fields on the inside and outside of the droplet interface that are expressible as complex phasors with the oscillation frequency as the imposed electric field. V=V e^{i\\\\omega t} Since Torza treats the fluid inside the droplet and outside the droplet as having no net charge, the governing equation for the electric stress sub-problem reduces to Gauss's law with a spatial charge density of zero. By re-expressing the electric field in terms of the gradient of the electric potential, the governing electric equation reduces to Laplace's equation. Separation of variables can be used to derive a solution to this equation of the form of a power series multiplied by the cosine of the polar angle taken relative to the direction of the electric field. Using the solutions for the magnitude of the electric potentials on the inside and outside of the droplet, the electric stress created on the bubble/droplet interface can be determined using the definition of the Maxwell stress tensor and neglecting the electric field. \\\\sigma_{i j} = \\\\epsilon_0 \\\\left(E_i E_j - \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\delta_{ij} E^2\\\\right) + \\\\frac{1}{\\\\mu_0} \\\\left(B_i B_j - \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\delta_{ij} B^2\\\\right) It is worth noting that because the electric field is in the form of a phasor, the scalar product and tensor product of electric field with itself, as are present in the Maxwell stress tensor, result in a doubling of the oscillation frequency. The sub-problem Torza solves to determine the velocity fields and hydrodynamic stresses that result from the electric stress is of exactly the same form as the one Taylor used for his solution for steady electric fields. Specifically, Torza solves the streamfunction formulation of the curl of the Navier‚ÄìStokes equations in spherical coordinates by adopting Taylor‚Äôs streamfunction solution form and imposing stress balance conditions at the interface. Using the streamfunction solution, Torza derived analytical expressions for the velocity fields that could be used to derive analytical expressions for hydrodynamic stress on the interface for incompressible Newtonian fluids. 0= \\\\left[ \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial r^2} + \\\\frac{\\\\sin \\\\theta}{r^2} \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\theta}\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sin(\\\\theta)^2} \\\\frac{\\\\partial }{\\\\partial \\\\theta}\\\\right) \\\\right]^2 \\\\psi. \\\\psi = \\\\left[\\\\frac{C_1 b^4}{r^2} + C_2 b^2 + \\\\frac{C_3}{b r^3} + \\\\frac{C_4 r^5}{ b^3})\\\\right] \\\\sin(\\\\theta)^2 \\\\cos(\\\\theta). \\\\tau_{ij} = \\\\mu \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial v_j}{\\\\partial x_i} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial v_i}{\\\\partial x_j}\\\\right). To incorporate the effect of surface tension into the periodic deformation of a droplet, Torza calculated the difference in electric and hydrodynamic stresses across the interface and used that as the driving stress in the Laplace Pressure Equation. This is the most important relation for this system because it describes the mechanism by which differences in stress across the droplet interface can induce deformation by inducing a change of the principle radii of curvature. \\\\Delta \\\\tau_{r r} + \\\\Delta \\\\sigma_{r r} = \\\\gamma\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{R_1}+\\\\frac{1}{R_2}\\\\right) Using this relation between surface pressures in conjunction with geometrical arguments derived by Taylor for small deformations, Torza was able to derive an analytical expression for the deformation ratio as the sum of a steady component and an oscillating component with a frequency that is twice that of the imposed electric field as shown. D = \\\\frac{9 \\\\epsilon_0 K_2}{16 \\\\gamma} \\\\phi (E_0^2 b) + \\\\frac{9 \\\\epsilon_0 K_2}{32 \\\\gamma} \\\\frac{I \\\\cos(2 \\\\omega t + \\\\alpha)}{\\\\sqrt{1+k^2 \\\\lambda^2}}(E_0^2 b) The important terms to recognize in this expression are \\\\phi in the steady term, the cosine in the time-varying term, and gamma in both terms. The phi term is what Taylor and Torza refer to as a ‚Äúdiscriminating function‚Äù because its value determines whether the droplet will tend to spend more time in either a prolate or oblate shape. It is a function of all the material properties and the frequency of oscillation, but is completely independent of time. The time varying cosine term shows that the droplet does in fact oscillate at twice the frequency of the imposed electric field but is also generally out of phase due to the constant alpha term that arises due to the mathematics. The other variables are constants that depend on the geometric, electric, and thermodynamic properties of the relevant liquids in addition to the oscillation frequency. In general, it is apparent that the magnitude of the droplet deformation is constrained by the interfacial tension, represented by gamma. As the interfacial tension increases, the net magnitude decreases due to an increase in capillary forces. Since the equilibrium shape of a droplet tends towards the one with the minimum energy, a large value of interfacial tension tends to drive the droplet shape towards a sphere.  Safety and practical considerations  Although periodic droplet deformation is widely studied for its practical industrial applications, its implementation poses significant safety issues and physical limitations due to the use of electric field. In order to induce periodic droplet deformation using an electric field, an extremely large amplitude electric field must be applied. Research studies using water droplets suspended in silicone oil required root-mean-square values as high as 10^6 V/m . Even for a small electrode spacing, this type of field requires electric potentials greater than 500V, which is roughly three times wall voltage in the United States. Practically speaking, this large of an electric field can only be achieved if the electrode spacing is very small (~ O(0.1 mm)) or if a high-voltage amplifier is available. It is for this reason that the majority of studies of this phenomenon are currently being conducted in research laboratories using small diameter tubes; tubes of this size are in fact present in industrial cooling systems, such as nuclear reactors.

He was the guitarist for the bands V8 and Horcas. Biography Civile was born in Caseros, Buenos Aires, and began his music career in the band T√© de brujas. The guitarist of V8, Ricardo Moreno, left the band in 1982 for health reasons and proposed Civile as his replacement. The drummer Alejandro Colantonio left the band as well, and was replaced by Gustavo Rowek. The lineup of Civile, Rowek, Ricardo Iorio and Alberto Zamarbide is the most famous one of the band. They recorded two long plays, Luchando por el Metal () and Un Paso Mas En La Batalla (). The band moved to Santos, in Brazil, attempting to continue their career there. The project was abandoned and the band returned to Argentina in 1985, but Civile stayed in Brazil because his wife was ill. Civile returned to Argentina in 1988. He created a thrash metal band, Horcas. Civile was the lead guitarist, Adri√°n Zucchi the second guitarist, Eddie Walker the bassist, Gabriel Ganzo the drummer, and Hugo Ben√≠tez the singer. Zucchi left the band, which recorded its first LP, Reinar√° la tempestad (), in 1990. The second work, O√≠d mortales el grito sangrado (), had two new members, Oscar Castro as second guitarist and Norberto Ya√±ez as drummer. They played with Metallica, Mot√∂rhead, Exodus, Kreator and Ratos de Por√£o. The band got a new singer, Christian Bertoncelli, and went many years without new productions. Horcas took part in the Metal Rock Festival, a festival with the bands Rata Blanca and Logos, closed by a reunion of V8. Gustavo Rowek and Alberto Zamarbide were members of those two bands. The reunion was controversial because Ricardo Iorio, leader of V8, refused to take part in it. The reunion of V8 was recorded in a live CD, \\"Homenaje\\". The third CD, Vence (), was made with a new line-up. Sebasti√°n Coria as the second guitarist, Guillermo de Luca as drummer, and Walter Meza as vocalist. The band became popular again. They headed the second edition of the Metal Rock Festival, this time a common festival. The band recorded a new CD, Eternos (), in January 1999. The art for the CD, published in an interview by the magazine Epopeya #22 (April 1999), included photos of Civile playing truco with the Grim Reaper (who was Walter Meza with a hood). He performed in his last concert with Horcas on April 23 at the pub El Duende. He commented to the band that he was planning to retire from music. In the following days he saluted other people close to him. Although some initial versions stated he committed suicide shooting himself in the chest, the official cause of death is catalogued as doubtful since it happened on April 28, 1999 and there are reasons to believe thah he was murdered.http://www.diarioregistrado.com/no- se/la-muerte-de-osvaldo-civile-y-el-nacimiento-de-claudio-o- connor_a5660c6baa424ffcb0aa20072 Newspapers that reported Civile's death used the pictures of him with the Grim Reaper to accompany the story.Horcas Biography , Music Might.com, retrieved 22 December 2013 Gustavo Rowek pointed out that Civile had problems with alcoholism and frequent episodes of depression.

He made his major league debut with the Nationals in 2014, but spent four years in injury rehab and the minor leagues after Tommy John surgery in September 2015 before being called back up to the major leagues in September 2019. Career=Amateur Barrett graduated from Evansville Central High School and attended Wabash Valley College for two years before transferring to the University of Mississippi (Ole Miss). He played college baseball for the Wabash Valley Warriors and the Ole Miss Rebels. Barrett was drafted in the 2006, 2008 and 2009 Major League Baseball Drafts, but did not sign a professional contract. The Los Angeles Dodgers did not offer him a contract in 2006. When he was drafted by the Minnesota Twins two years later, Barrett had already committed to Ole Miss. He did not pitch well in his first year with the Rebels, and was not going to receive a bonus from the Texas Rangers in 2009. ProfessionalEarly years with the Washington Nationals (2010‚Äì13)= Barrett ultimately signed with the Washington Nationals after being drafted in the ninth round of the 2010 Major League Baseball Draft. Barrett played in the Arizona Fall League in 2012. He started the 2013 season with the Class-AA Harrisburg Senators, for whom he was often called upon to close games out in the ninth inning or later. He worked closely with pitching coach Paul Menhart, who later became the Nationals' minor league pitching coordinator. =Major leagues (2014‚Äì15)= Barrett was added to the Nationals' 40-man roster for the first time after the 2013 season, and after impressing during major league spring training, he made the Nationals' Opening Day roster for the 2014 season. He made his debut in the ninth inning of the team's first game of the year against the New York Mets, striking out two while picking up his first career win. Barrett became a trusted member of manager Matt Williams' bullpen and was included on the Nationals' playoff roster in the National League Division Series. Called on to pitch in Game 4 of the series against the San Francisco Giants, the rookie threw a wild pitch over the head of catcher Wilson Ramos while intentionally walking Pablo Sandoval, allowing Joe Panik to score the winning run from third base. Midway through the 2015 season, Barrett began experiencing discomfort in his right pitching elbow. After he gave up three earned runs in an August 5, 2015, appearance against the Arizona Diamondbacks, the Nationals optioned him to the Class-AAA Syracuse Chiefs, but they voided the option and placed him on the disabled list for an elbow strain. On September 4, 2015, Barrett underwent Tommy John surgery, in which the ulnar collateral ligament of the elbow in his left arm was transferred to his right arm. Several bone spurs were also removed from his elbow. In December, he had bone spurs in his ankle removed. =Rehab and return to the minor leagues (2016‚Äì18)= On July 23, 2016, while rehabbing at the Nationals' minor league complex in Viera, Florida, Barrett fractured the humerus bone in his right arm while pitching. Witnesses to the incident likened the sound of the bone breaking to a gunshot. Teammate Mat Latos reportedly vomited in the dugout, and Nationals manager Dusty Baker sequestered the only video of the injury on a locked hard drive so that no one could watch it. Barrett underwent surgery performed by Dr. James Andrews, which left two plates and sixteen screws embedded in the bone of his arm. Andrews later compared the fracture to the kind of traumatic injury he would expect to see from a car crash victim. Despite the severity of the injury, Barrett continued to ramp up his baseball activity, hoping to sign a contract to pitch in 2017. After progressing enough to start throwing during the offseason, however, Barrett went in for a CT scan that showed his arm was not healing as quickly as hoped. On the advice of doctors, he shut down his throwing regimen, although he continued working out in the hopes of making an eventual return to the mound. Barrett signed a new minor league contract with the Nationals on April 3, 2017, after missing the entire 2016 season. He did not appear in a game during the 2017 season. As the contract he had signed was a two-year deal, he was invited to participate in minor league spring training as a member of the Nationals organization in 2018. He pitched against live competition for the first time since 2015 during a spring exhibition against the Canadian national baseball team and was assigned to the Short Season-A Auburn Doubledays to start the 2018 season. He made his first appearance in a professional game since 2015 on June 15, 2018, striking out three batters for a hold. He elected free agency on November 2, 2018, but soon signed a new minor league contract with the Nationals that included a non-roster invitation to major league spring training. =Return to the major leagues (2019)= Barrett speaks in 2020 After spending part of spring training on the major league side of the Nationals camp in West Palm Beach, Florida, Barrett was assigned to Class-AA Harrisburg to start the 2019 season. As he had in 2013, before reaching the major leagues, Barrett served as the Senators' closer. On June 29, 2019, he became Harrisburg's all-time leader in games saved with 41 across multiple years, as he notched his fifteenth save of the season. As the season progressed, Barrett built up arm strength and recovered much of his former velocity, also incorporating a changeup into a pitching arsenal that had predominantly featured a fastball and a slider. The Nationals developed and implemented a plan to groom Barrett for a return to the major leagues during the 2019 season. After the Senators concluded their regular season, during which Barrett recorded a 2.75 ERA and 31 saves (leading the minor leagues), Harrisburg manager Matt LeCroy announced that Barrett would be promoted to the Nationals for the first time in more than four years. The Nationals officially selected Barrett's contract on September 4, 2019. Barrett appeared in a game for the first time since the 2015 season on September 7, pitching a scoreless inning in relief against the Atlanta Braves and picking up his first strikeout since August 1, 2015, as he caught All-Star Ronald Acu√±a Jr. looking on a slider. He made 3 relief appearances in 2019 with a 15.43 ERA. The Nationals finished the year with a 93-69 record, clinching a wild card spot and eventually winning the 2019 World Series over the Astros. Barrett did not take part in any postseason action but still won his first world championship as he was still on the Nationals' 40-man roster at the time. Barrett was outrighted off of the Nationals 40-man roster on October 9, 2020, and elected free agency the next day. Personal life Barrett met Kendyl Mygatt while a student at the University of Mississippi. She had transferred to Ole Miss from Texas Tech, and played soccer at both schools. They married on October 20, 2012. The couple had a daughter, Kollyns, in 2017. Barrett is a Christian.

In 2011 it had 221 local branches with around 27,000 members.Mitgliederzeitschrift ‚ÄûPf√§lzerwald‚Äú, 2 The first branch was founded on 27 November 1902 in Ludwigshafen. Its first chairman was the industrialist, Anton Fasig. After other branches had formed the following year, the umbrella organization was founded in 1903. One of the founding members of the Palatine Forest Club, formed at the initiative of Ludwigshafen railway official, Otto Link, was the Palatine artist, Heinrich Strieffler. Karl Albrecht von Ritter was elected by the founding members as the managing director (Regierungsdirektor). Since 1908 the club has commemorated places of historical or natural significance by erecting and maintained a total of 306 so-called Ritter Stones (Rittersteine) - sandstone boulders with engraved inscriptions. The head office of the Palatine Forest Club is in the town of Neustadt an der Weinstra√üe. its chairman since 2005 has been Klaus Weichel from Kaiserslautern, and its CEO since 1992 has been Bernd Wallner from Gro√üfischlingen. The club has a 25-man board and 10 districts, maintaining a foundation that supports nature and monument conservation and is a member of the German Ramblers Association. The membership publication of the club since 1902 has been te quarterly magazine, Pf√§lzerwald. Its youth organisation is called the Deutsche Wanderjugend/ DWJ. The club maintains around 100 walking huts in the Palatinate and the Saarpfalz regions. Some are only managed at weekends, 17 are hostels with overnight accommodation for walking groups. One of the main tasks of the club, which is a recognized federal nature conservation organisation in Rhineland-Palatinate, is the signing of 12,000 km of walking routes in the Palatine Forest as well as organizing 10,000 annual walking and leisure events.

The bridge is above the river and when it was completed in 1911, it was the second-highest railroad bridge in the United States. It is a steel two-hinge arch span with a total length of .  History  The crossing of the Crooked River played a critical role in the competition to build a railroad up the Deschutes River Valley.Grande The incentive for railroad construction was reaching the vast stands of timber south of Bend. The Oregon Trunk Railway, a subsidiary of the Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway owned by Jim Hill of the Great Northern Railway, started up the west side of the Deschutes while the Des Chutes Railroad, owned by Edward Harriman of the Union Pacific, started up the east side. At North Junction, approximately south of the Columbia River, Hill's Oregon Trunk crossed over to the east bank. At both railroads would have had to cross a major tributary of the Deschutes, the Crooked River. There was only one place where the cliffs on both sides were close enough to build a bridge. Jim Hill had obtained the rights to the location when his Oregon Trunk Railroad acquired the Central Oregon Railroad Company on December 1, 1909. The Central Oregon had laid no track and the rights to the bridge site were its principal asset. Hill's acquisition of the location forced Harriman to negotiate a settlement whereby the Oregon Trunk, Hill's railroad, would own almost the entire line from the Columbia to Bend but Harriman's company would have the right to use the track. Through a series of mergers the rail line and the bridge became part of the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway (which changed its name to BNSF Railway in 2005). Union Pacific, Harriman's old railroad, still has the right to use the track. Great Northern extended the line south from Bend to Chemult in 1928.BroganHofsomer The bridge was designed by the famous bridge architect, Ralph Modjeski, who also designed the San Francisco‚ÄìOakland Bay Bridge. The Missouri Valley Bridge & Iron Company built the bridge by cantilevering it out from rock walls on both sides of the canyon. A myth arose, fostered by a photograph of men climbing a rope ladder up to the bridge, that the bridge builders camped at the bottom of the canyon and climbed up to work every day. In fact the crew lived two miles north of the bridge in a large construction camp at Opal City.Ramsey Opal City was expected to thrive well into the future but it was completely abandoned soon after the railroad was completed. The first steel for the bridge arrived on May 18, 1911, and was lowered by derrick to the bottom of the gorge. Men climbed down rope ladders to attach cables to the steel beams and the steel was hoisted back up both sides of the canyon as the beams were needed. The first train crossed the bridge only four months later on September 17. Half the rivets holding the bridge together were installed after trains started using the bridge. The bridge was built quickly to facilitate laying the last of track to Bend where Jim Hill himself drove the \\"golden\\" spike on October 5. Dramatic photographs of the bridge's construction were taken by Olof Hedlund of Madras.Crow and Ramsey  Nearby bridges  Less than upriver from the bridge are the Crooked River High Bridge, the Rex T. Barber Veterans Memorial Bridge (which carries U.S. Route 97 over the Crooked River), and the Peter Skene Ogden State Scenic Viewpoint. Further upriver the City of Prineville Railway, linking Redmond and Prineville, operates the only other railroad bridge across the Crooked River.  References  *Brogan, Phil F. East of the Cascades.

Raised a Southern California surfer, Weed learned the banjo at age 17 and played professionally at 18. He was in various bands and he worked as a studio musician singing and playing electric guitar in the Greater Los Angeles Area. He lived in Japan for a time producing records for Sony-Epic, and he lived on the island of Maui where he rediscovered the banjo. Weed settled in Tucson, Arizona, for eight years, playing in local bands. Working with luthier Dennis Coon he designed and built a seven-string hybrid of banjo and guitar called the \\"Sevan\\". He released a solo banjo album: Milagros; in mid-2005 the music was featured on NPR. In 2008 Weed moved to Northern California where he released an album of Americana, world music and bluegrass songs: Soul House. In 2020 he released a classical album, Light and Dark, with the Prague Symphony Orchestra. Weed plays concerts and festivals, and he teaches banjo privately. Early life Timothy James Wiedenkeller was born in Orange, California, on April 11, 1959. His father Ted Wiedenkeller had served as a United States Marine Corps fighter pilot also flying twin-engine bombers in the Pacific with VMB-433 during World War II. His mother was a homemaker and teacher. Weed was the fourth of five children born to the family and grew up in Laguna BeachLib at Large: West Marin's Tim Weed celebrates his 'Soul House' Retrieved 2016-12-19. In school, Weed learned to sing in choir at age six and he learned to play the trumpet at age eight. His immediate family was somewhat musical but his grandfather, Peter Otto Wiedenkeller, was a professional musician who sometimes played flute with the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Peter was born in Vienna in 1894 then immigrated to New York City at the age of four. He was a flautist and piccolo player who served in the United States Army during World War I, became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1919, and continued to serve as an Army and Marine Corps bandleader. Peter studied under Frank Damrosch at the Institute of Musical Art (later known as the Juilliard School). Weed's grandmother was also a professional musician: she taught music and sang with the Los Angeles Master Chorale. Weed enjoyed surfing in his teens at Laguna Beach, but he also took notice of banjo parts in popular rock music, for instance the handful of Eagles songs featuring Bernie Leadon on banjo, and the few Poco tunes featuring Rusty Young on banjo. He also enjoyed the song \\"Dueling Banjos\\" which was a hit for Eric Weissberg in 1973. Weed acquired recordings of Jerry Garcia playing banjo in the all-star bluegrass group Old & In the Way. Weed was given a $60 banjo on his 17th birthday and he began learning it intensively on his own, initially by using a tape recorder to play back his favorite banjo recordings at half speed. His friend Jeff Harvey practiced with him; Harvey would later focus on mandolin. The two blond-haired surfers took part in jam sessions with local musicians; Weed's first and only banjo lesson came at a jam session in Huntington Beach where luthier Greg Rich taught him to play Larry McNeely's banjo transcription of Benny Goodman's \\"Slipped Disc\\" in just half an hour. Rich said that Weed \\"not only learned how to play it note for note but nailed the speed, timing and technique almost as well as Larry himself.\\" Bluegrass banjo Harvey and Weed joined with veteran singer/songwriter/guitarist Ken Orrick to form a band called Last Chance. They played the Golden West Bluegrass Festival in 1977 and began touring the Western United States. In 1978, Stuart Duncan joined the band on fiddle. Regular appearances included performances at Knott's Berry Farm. They were tapped by Cliffie Stone to play his \\"Hometown Jamboree\\" at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. Various other musicians came through the band including Alison Brown on dobro. During this period, Weed was invited to play a variety of vintage banjos, guitars and mandolins from the collections of R. C. \\"Randy\\" Snoddy and Mac Yasuda. From this experience he developed a preference for banjos with more sustain for better melodic expression. When Last Chance disbanded, Weed and Harvey backed children's entertainers Janet & Judy Robinson. Session player and composer Weed switched to electric guitar in the 1980s and worked as a session musician and high tenor harmony singer for various bands. He backed Greg Leisz, Rosie Flores and Al Perkins, among others. Expanding his musical scope with rock, jazz and fusion, Weed played with Michael Tavera and other Los Angeles-area musicians. In 1983 Weed recorded for the first time one of his original compositions, a large format recording with orchestral backing; all recorded by Allen Sides at Ocean Way Recording. The demo did not bring a recording contract but it helped Weed get further bookings as a studio musician, vocalist, and also as a songwriter and music composer. In 1985 Weed joined with Tavera in a band called Max‚Äîthey tried to get a record contract but the grueling process proved ultimately unsuccessful. Burned out on the L.A. music scene, Weed moved to Japan in 1987 to continue his work in music. There, he produced albums for Epic/Sony Records. He toured Southeast Asia and the South Pacific. This experience brought him into contact with world music. He moved back to Southern California and focused on composing music for television and films, especially documentaries. He started a family with his partner, celebrating a son in 1990. Weed moved to the island of Maui in Hawaii in 1993 and co-wrote music for the dance performance work Garden of Be in 1994. He composed orchestral cues for documentary films. The Maui Symphony Orchestra hired him to play banjo in a concert, so he picked up the banjo after 15 years away from the instrument. Weed began to write original banjo music in the classical style, starting with a 25-minute-long concerto. He composed purely by playing the banjo to evoke a feeling, rather than by thinking about technical aspects of music composition, so much so that when he turned to staff paper to score the concerto, he realized he had not even considered what key it was in. At the end of 1995 Weed moved his family to Southern California where he formed the band Banjambo to explore jazz and eclectic music. This band included drummer Steve DiStanislao, fiddler Craig Eastman, and saxophonist Paul Carman who had toured with Frank Zappa. Weed also played reggae with bassist Ron \\"Stepper\\" McQueen and other members of Steel Pulse. In 1995 a daughter was born to the family. Tucson and Milagros Weed moved his family to Tucson in 1999. He played bluegrass music in a Tucson-based band named Frog Mountain, with fiddler Chris Brashear and flatpicking guitar champion Peter McLaughlin. Weed's original score was featured on the 2004 animated program Davey and Goliath's Snowboard Adventure, a Christmas special. Weed began to write original songs with more of an emotional, personal nature. He performed with McLaughlin as well as with Tucson-based musicians such as fiddler Jesse Stockman, bassist/violinist Rob Paulus, Paulus's wife vocalist Randi Dorman, vocalist Debbie Daly, kalimba player Mark Holdaway, percussionists Todd Hammes and Jeff Friedl, and didgeridoo player Allan Shockley. He backed singer- songwriter Nancy McCallion in 2004 in her first solo album after being in the Mollys folk group. Weed's banjo style was not traditional; he did not use the banjo's high, short fifth string as a drone. Instead, he used it chromatically to extend the instrument's range to higher notes. Weed decided to augment the guitar with this same ability, so in 2004 he designed an acoustic/electric/MIDI guitar/banjo solid-body instrument by adding a short seventh-string. This prototype instrument soon broke in an accident, so Weed teamed with luthier Dennis Coon to redesign it as a hollow-bodied acoustic instrument, creating a hybrid they called the \\"Sevan\\". At the end of 2004, Weed produced his first solo album, Milagros (Spanish for \\"Miracles\\"). The CD was a collection of original banjo compositions in the style of classical music, except for one of the tracks, \\"Haiku\\", which featured the Sevan instead of the banjo. Another track called \\"Lama\\" was written in the classical Indian raga style. The first tune on the CD‚Äî\\"Morro Glenn\\"‚Äîwas featured in July 2005 on NPR's All Songs Considered, a national radio show by Bob Boilen. On his label Acoustic Oasis, mandolinist and record producer David Grisman released the album as an independently produced offering. Grisman said of Weed that he \\"can play everything from hardcore bluegrass to Bach. His original banjo music is grounded in many traditions, including Indian classical\\". In 2005, Weed played for the Dalai Lama in Tucson; he premiered his song \\"Love and Peace and Happiness\\" which would end up on his next album. Playing the banjo, Weed recorded with the Dave Matthews Band on the score of the documentary film Grand Canyon Adventure: River at Risk which was released in early 2008. Northern California and Soul House While living in Tucson, Weed's relationship with the mother of his children came to an end. Weed met vocalist and yoga instructor Debbie Daly in 2003 and partnered with her. In 2008 Weed and Daly moved from Tucson to Point Reyes Station in rural West Marin County, north of San Francisco near the Pacific Ocean. In the San Francisco Bay Area, Weed became known in the music community as a banjo virtuoso; a \\"musician's musician\\". The Point Reyes Light wrote that he \\"quickly carved a niche as one of the area's best-loved performers, often playing at benefits and community events.\\" He was a featured performer at the first California Banjo Gathering in Sacramento in September 2008, at which Pete Seeger joined by teleconference and expressed appreciation for Weed's original bluegrass song \\"Long Tom\\". Weed returned to Tucson in October to headline at the Arizona Folklore Preserve. In a series which included Charlie Tagawa, Weed performed solo banjo at the Summer Jazz Banjo Festival in June 2009, held at Saint Mary's College of California. Weed joined with other musicians to play \\"Soldier's Joy\\" at the memorial service for billionaire banjo player Warren Hellman in December 2012. He has played with Grisman, Peter Rowan and Ramblin' Jack Elliott. In May 2013, Weed was featured on the cover of the Banjo Newsletter, the most prominent magazine for banjo players. In the magazine he was interviewed by Mike Kropp of the bluegrass band Northern Lights. Kropp said after hearing the album Milagros that Weed was \\"the world's greatest player I'd never heard of.\\" In October 2013, Weed released his second album: Soul House. The title was inspired by a comment from Welsh ecologist Ianto Evans, known for advocating natural cob houses, who said the house in the Western world is too often a storage place for things, when it should be a vessel to nurture the human spirit. The Soul House album consisted of Weed's original vocal songs and one traditional African song. Weed had been working on the project since 2007. The album evolved for years; it was recorded in eight studios using nine audio engineers. Weed's son Tucker and his daughter Anza are among the 24 musicians appearing on the album. In support of the CD release, Weed played a series of concerts including an appearance at Yoshi's jazz club in Oakland following shows in Point Reyes, Santa Cruz and San Rafael. The nine-piece group appearing in Point Reyes included bassist Sascha Jacobsen of Trio Garufa, mandolinist Dana Rath of the Modern Mandolin Quartet, cellist Myra Joy of the San Francisco Conservatory of Music, veteran bluegrass fiddler Blaine Sprouse, multi-instrumentalist and research scientist Mark Robertson-Tessi, percussionists Tobias Roberson and Steve Brock, and Debbie Daly on vocals and guitar. While practicing, Weed and Jacobsen discovered that their grandfather and great-grandfather had played together in New York: Juilliard violinist Sascha Jacobsen had been a colleague and close friend of flautist Peter Wiedenkeller. At the end of October, Weed was featured on the cover of the Marin Independent Journal, the article describing the CD and his career. Light and Dark Weed performed at Stag's Leap Wine Cellars in Napa in 2016, and was approached by listeners who were in the New York Philharmonic. They convinced Weed to compose an orchestral piece with banjo as featured soloist, and Weed ended up collaborating with arranger Stephen Cohn on a new symphonic work, \\"Colloquium: Dark & Light\\". During this time, Weed was also working with his nonprofit group Sound Orchard dedicated to building community through music, and he teamed with his violinist colleague Sascha Jacobsen to orchestrate Weed's earlier suite \\"Morro Glen\\" for orchestra. In 2019, Weed and his partner Elizabeth \\"Liebe\\" Patterson traveled to the Czech Republic to record \\"Colloquium: Dark & Light\\" and \\"Morro Glen\\" with the Prague Symphony Orchestra at SONO Records. Patterson served as musical director during the recording and mixing. Weed announced in August 2020 that he would release his third album, Light and Dark, the following month. The album, containing the two concertos for banjo and orchestra, was released on the label Plant Studios Records, founded by Arne Frager who ran the Record Plant in Sausalito.

It is Gearhart's first and most famous novel, and continues to be used in Women's Studies classes as a characteristic example of the separatist feminism movement from the 1970s. Structure The Wanderground is a collection of short, interlocking narratives that build on each other to form a full novel. Chapters fit together loosely, often focusing on completely different characters in each chapter, or taking place in a different part of the world Gearhart created, although many characters make reappearances throughout the collection, as the stories begin to build on each other. Many of the chapters were first published as short stories, in fanzines, magazines, and lesbian periodicals including Ms., The Witch and the Chameleon, Quest: A Feminist Quarterly, and WomanSpirit Summary The Wanderground is set in the United States, in the future, although no date is given. The stories focus on the hill women, a group of women who have fled from the men-ruled cities to the wilderness, where they live in all-women communities in harmony with each other and the natural world. The hill women have psychic powers that they use to communicate with each other and with animals, and to move through the world. The main narrative that weaves throughout almost all of the stories, is caused by some kind of shift in the cosmic balance between the hill women and the cities. Rumors are whispered, things are getting worse for women in the cities. As the stories build on each other, subtle remarks are made about how things are getting worse, the cities are becoming even more controlling, it is more dangerous for the women underground, men are appearing outside of the cities, even to the point of rapes occurring in the borderlands. Something is changing. The tension finally comes to the foreground when the gentles (gay men, who have the greatest respect for all women, especially the hill women) request a meeting with the hill women. The message is smuggled out of the city, and a great discussion begins. Even though the gentles are considered to be allies of the hill women, they are still men, and this mixed status of ally and enemy causes a great debate. Characters As The Wanderground functions as a series of short stories in different parts of a world, the characters are listed here in association with the setting in which they appear. *Western Ensconcement, a community of women: Seja, Clana, Zephyr, Voki, Artilidea *Eastern Ensconcement,a community of women: Jaqua, Troja, Pelagine, *Kochlias, noted for being the home of the 'Remember Rooms': Fora, Manaje, Li, Clana *Borderlands, the edge of the hill women's territory: Alaka, Ono, Egathese, Blase *Dangerland, between the land of the hill women and the city: Pony, Krueva, Ijeme, Ursula *Earlytown, an abandoned town just outside the city: The Gentles, Evona, Chthona, Tulu *The City: Betha, Ijeme, Evona Themes=Gender Gender is a source of tension throughout the novel. Among the basic tenets of the relationship between the communities of hill women to men is \\"It is not in his nature not to rape. It is not in my nature to be raped. We do not co-exist.\\" (page 25). Gearhart said in an interview with off our backs that figuring out how those dynamics play out, the question of \\"what is the hill women's relationship to the men\\" is one of the main questions of the book. Environmentalism This book is also linked by scholars with the idea of ecofeminism. The ideas it presents of women living as one with the greater natural world, of being able to control one's fertility, and of the communication with other non-human living beings, as well as the poetic style of prose Gearhart writes in are of particular interest to readers coming from an environmental background.

Having once again been employed on neutrality protection duty at the outbreak of the Second World War, Brand was captured by the Germans during their invasion of Norway in April 1940. After serving in Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine in the Norwegian Campaign that followed the invasion, she was renamed Tarantel and employed as a Vorpostenboot in occupied Norway.

Although considered as having quite good seagoing characteristics, the vessels had difficulty firing torpedoes in rough seas. In calm seas the boats were hard to spot, with little engine noise or bow wave, which increased the chance of a successful torpedo attack. The boats were also seen as not being manoeuvrable enough, as well as having an exposed bridge in a bow turret and poor ventilation. Some of the issues of the early vessels were dealt with in the last four 1.-class boats built. Early service Brand (left) and fellow 1.-class torpedo boat at Marvika naval base in 1903 In the summer of 1900, Brand took part in a comparatively large-scale naval exercise, together with three other 1.-class boats , and Trods.

The state of armed neutrality was maintained until the end of the war in 1918.Steen 1954, p. 13 Brand took part in neutrality protection patrols during the war, and was based in Bergen in Western Norway. In May 1915, Brand carried out torpedo firing exercises together with three other torpedo boats.Melien 1995, pp. 81, 145 In the immediate aftermath of the war, from 12 December 1918 until the spring of 1919, Brand was stationed at √Ölesund. She was tasked with patrolling for drifting mines off the coast. During their stay in √Ölesund, the torpedo boat's crew deactivated or destroyed 17 naval mines, and were also put and stand-by to intervene in riots between locals and fishermen in Fosnav√•g.R√•bben 1973, pp. 559-561 In February 1919, the crew of Brand rescued two survivors from the shipwrecked fishing vessel Korsfjord I, which had run aground with the loss of seven crewmen.R√•bben 1973, p. 574 Inter-war years Between the world wars, the Norwegian torpedo boat fleet carried out exercises during the summers, but were severely restricted by a lack of funds. The boats that had been built around the start of the 20th century were outdated as warships, and mostly restricted to lying in port. Seventeen torpedo boats had been decommissioned in the years 1920‚Äì1931, after having been worn out by the intensive neutrality protection service in the preceding war years. Although 23 torpedo boats were retained, no modernizations were carried out,Hegland and Lilleheim 1998, pp. 47‚Äì49 and the vessels were considered as being mostly useful as escorts and coastal guard vessels.Steen 1954, p. 19 Second World War=Neutrality protection At the outbreak of the Second World War, many of the vessels of the Royal Norwegian Navy were activated for neutrality protection duties. The 1939 mobilization of both the Royal Norwegian Navy and the coastal artillery was less comprehensive than that in 1914, due to a lack of trained crews and officers to man the ships.Steen 1954, pp. 13‚Äì14 Brand was mobilized, and formed part of the 2nd Naval District's 4th Torpedo Boat Division. In addition to Brand, the 4th Torpedo Boat Division was made up by the fellow 1.-class boats and . The 4th Torpedo Boat Division was under the command of Lieutenant Thorleif Pettersen, who was also the commanding officer of Storm.Steen 1956, pp. 17‚Äì22 Brand was under the command of Second Lieutenant Ivar Arne Midtland, and carried out escort missions along the Norwegian coast after the outbreak of war. The ships of the Royal Norwegian Navy were scattered along the Norwegian coast to provide a capacity to hail and escort foreign ships and confront possible neutrality violators at as many points as possible. The deployment of the warships singly with large distances between each vessel reduced their combat value against any determined naval attack against Norway.Hegland and Lilleheim 1998, pp. 50‚Äì52 By April 1940, Brand was based at Fedje, but had been sent to Bergen for repairs at the naval base Marineholmen days before the 9 April 1940 German invasion of Norway.Steen 1956, p. 32 On 8 April 1940, the commanding officer of the 2nd Naval District, Rear-Admiral Carsten Tank-Nielsen ordered the commanders of Brand, S√¶l and Storm to refuel, resupply ammunition and put their boats on action stations. Brand began resupplying in Bergen shortly after receiving her orders from Rear-Admiral Tank-Nielsen. Similar orders went out the other warships of Bergen section of the naval district, foremost the destroyer and the submarine .Steen 1956, p. 47Haarr 2009, p. 250 German invasion Reports of fighting between Norwegian coastal fortresses and foreign warships in the Oslofjord further east reached the 2nd Naval District at 00:28 on 9 April. In response to the reports, naval mines were laid in the leads off Bergen and torpedo boats deployed to intercept any possible intruders making their way towards the city. Warning shots and live rounds were fired shortly after 02:00 at the intruding German flotilla by Ler√∏y Fort, and unsuccessful attacks and intercepts carried out by several warships as the warships of the German Gruppe 3 closed in on Bergen. Brand had been ordered to take up an ambush position at Alv√∏y, but was delayed in reaching her designated position by necessary repairs.Steen 1956, pp. 58‚Äì67 The Norwegian warships at Bergen had been ordered by Rear-Admiral Tank-Nielsen to fire at any intruding ships.Haarr 2009, p. 256 Having completed her repairs, Brand left Marineholmen at 03:30. By that time the German invasion flotilla had reached the inner line of fortifications off Bergen, and was being engaged by the forts at Kvarven and Hellen. Brand was put on action stations and readied for torpedo attack from a position in the inlet Gravdalsviken. From her ambush position Brand could serve as a substitute for Kvarven's torpedo battery, which was inoperable at the time. When the German ships forced their way past the Norwegian coastal forts and entered Bergen harbour, they passed Brand at ranges between and at speeds estimated as between and . Although one or both of the torpedo launchers on Brand were primed and ready to fire at the intruding warships and chances to score a hit were \\"exceptionally good\\", Second Lieutenant Midtland failed to give the order to fire.Steen 1956, pp. 85‚Äì87 Eventually the increasing daylight reduced the chances of a successful attack, and the Germans had completed their intrusion into Bergen harbour. After removing his ship from her defensive position, Second Lieutenant Midtland brought Brand to port in Laksev√•g, before leaving the boat and crew and heading to Marineholmen, where he was quickly interned by the Germans.Terjesen 2000, p. 64 Second Lieutenant Midtland had decided against scuttling his vessel, later claiming to have discussed the matter with a senior officer who had advised him that there was no point in destroying Brand due to the vessel's age. The remaining crew members abandoned Brand on 11 April. On 16 April, the Germans seized Brand in Laksev√•g and took her into Kriegsmarine service.Steen 1956, p. 150Vold 1995, p. 269 The Norwegian crew from Brand was interned at Marineholmen and held captive on various ships for close to two months.Steen 1956, pp. 129‚Äì130 Brand was one of four Norwegian warships captured by the Germans near Bergen shortly after their attack, the others being the minelayer and two guard ships.Lindb√§ck-Larsen 1965, p. 126 Lieutenant (promoted since 1940) Ivar Arne Midtland was investigated post-war by the Military Investigative Commission of 1946, and found to have violated Paragraphs 77 and 99 of the Norwegian military penal code by not attacking when he had the chance, but was let off with a reprimand because of his \\"youth and inexperience\\".Fjeld 1999, p. 210 German service Shortly after their 16 April take-over of Brand, the Germans sent her and a motor boat to land troops on the island of Flat√∏y near Bergen. Flat√∏y was the location of both a coastal fort and a Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service base. As Brand was landing German troops on the south side of the island, a British Blackburn Skua dive bomber attacked the torpedo boat at around 07:00. Brand was struck in the boiler room amidships by a bomb that failed to explode and severely damaged, the German crew suffering casualties. The air attack led the Germans to abandon their landings and use the motor boat to tow Brand to Bergen for repairs.Hafsten, Larsstuvold, Olsen and Stenersen 2005, p. 69Hafsten and Arheim 2003, p. 141Steen 1956, pp. 150, 277‚Äì278 A German sailor who had been thrown overboard by the bomb and swam ashore at Isdalst√∏ was captured by Norwegian troops and brought to Balestrand on 17 April.Steen 1956, p. 278 Brand was further damaged in an attack on Bergen harbour by 803 Naval Air Squadron Blackburn Skuas later the same day, along with the U-boat .Hafsten, Larsstuvold, Olsen and Stenersen 2005, p. 85Haarr 2010, p. 136 After completing repairs in Bergen, Brand was deployed in late April 1940 for patrols of the entrance to the Sognefjord, scouting for Norwegian naval forces and escorting the German-controlled minelayers Uller and . Although spotted by Norwegian Marinens Flyvebaatfabrikk M.F.11 reconnaissance seaplanes late on 30 April, Brand was mistaken for a warship under Norwegian or British control and not attacked.

His work was often in a Wrenaissance style, as well as other post-gothic English historical revival styles, with influences from the Arts and Crafts movement and Richard Norman Shaw. His commissions including large houses and offices; he produced a number of works for Lloyds Bank as well as offices for the North Eastern Railway in London and York. Biography Horace Field was born 17 July 1861 at 22 Chalcot Crescent, London; the son of Horace Field (architect, District Surveyor of Putney and Roehampton, 1823‚Äì1879) and his wife Christina n√©e White (d. 1866). Horace Field trained as an architect at the Glasgow firm of John Burnet, then under Robert William Edis of London. Field was not inspired by Edis's work, but developed great admiration and respect for Richard Norman Shaw, architect and neighbour in Hampstead, who he knew socially ‚Äì both for his work and as an example of humanity. Field started his own practice in 1882, as Field and Moore, together with his father's assistant Edwin Emmanuel Moore; their first work was Wedderburn House (1884‚Äì5), a six-storey block of flats in Hampstead; Wedderburn Cottage (1886) followed adjacent. In 1887 he married Mary Francis Campbell,daughter of James Campbell at St James Episcopal Church, LeithSt James Gazette 27/12/1887 p15. He joined the Art Workers Guild in 1889. \\"The Hoo\\" (17, Lyndhurst Gardens) in Camden was built 1890, and further properties at Nos. 19‚Äì21 Lyndhurst Road in 1898. In 1890 Field took on Michael Bunney as a trainee; Bunney became Field's chief assistant, until 1902, when he formed his own practice. Together they wrote English domestic architecture of the XVII and XVIII centuries. Field's first commercial business client was Lloyds Bank who commissioned bank buildings at Hampstead c.1895; subsequently Lloyds used Field as architect over a 30-year period. In 1898 the North Eastern Railway (NER) chose Field as architect for their new main headquarters in York. Working with William Bell the company's architect, whose input was mainly structural or contractual, the office buildings were constructed between 1900 and 1906, with Field receiving ¬£1,750 payment for his work. Field also received the commission to design the NER's London offices in Cowley Street, his plans were submitted 1904 and the building completed 1906. In 1899 Evelyn Simmons joined the practice, initially being articled, then assistant and finally in partnership from 1905 to 1915. Further co-operation with Amos Faulkner, architect for the builders William Willett and Son, produced designs for several large London houses, and apartments. Field left the Art Workers' Guild in 1903 and joined RIBA in 1906. Mary Field's friendship with Elizabeth Garrett Anderson and her circle of friends led to him becoming the consulting architect to the New Hospital for Women on Euston Road from 1888 to 1905, where he designed a nurses home (now demolished) at the rear of the building.Minutes of the Building Committee, New Hospital for Women, held at the London Metropolitan Archives He was a keen golfer, which led to many commissions for \\"golf cottages\\" (the term then used for houses close to golf courses) near Woking, Surrey and Aldeburgh, Suffolk, where he also designed the Aldeburgh Golf Club house in 1911, a replacement for an earlier building destroyed by fire.Aldeburgh Golf Club 1884-2014 by Stephen Barnard He continued in practice until 1931, retiring to Rye in 1932, where he undertook a few commissions for small house designs and alterations. His last built design was in 1941, as a favour for his cousin Daisy Field, at Great Dixter, for a conversion of a store in the Oast House into a cow houseEast Sussex Record Office ref: DR/C/8/20. He died on 16th June 1948. Selected Works Fields' work has been described as being in the wrenaissance style; his exteriors included a variety of historical revival styles, such as Queen Anne revival and neo-Georgian. Most works were done in red brick, often with stone dressing. He often made use of steeply pitched roofs with dormer windows to contain extra stories.For details see individual building entries ;A list of works by Horace Field on the Historic England Register of Listed Buildingshttps://historicengland.org.uk/listing/what-is-designation/listed- buildings/: *Wedderburn House, 1 Wedderburn Road, Hampstead (1884‚Äì5). *\\"Wedderburn Cottage\\" 3, Wedderburn Road, Hampstead (1886). *5, Wedderburn Road, Hampstead (1886). *7 & 9, Wedderburn Road, Hampstead (1887). *11 & 13, Wedderburn Road, Hampstead (1888). *\\"The Hoo\\"; 17, Lyndhurst Gardens (1889‚Äì90). *11, 12 & 13 Gainsborough Gardens, Camden (1893‚Äì5). *14, Gainsborough Gardens, Hampstead (1894‚Äì5). *Lloyds Bank, 40 & 40A, Rosslyn Hill, with adjoining terraced houses, Hampstead (1895‚Äì6). *19, 20 & 21 Lyndhurst Road, Hampstead (1897‚Äì8). *Granville Hotel, Ramsgate, Kent (1900) Alterations.https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1203535 *North Eastern Railway company offices, York (1900‚Äì1906). *5.

It is subsocial, although it has some features which distinguish it from other social or subsocial spiders in the genus. It has long-lived nest sites, unlike the social spider Anelosimus eximius which has more transitory nest sites, and its webs do not have aerial threads found in other social and sub-social species. It has a female-biased sex ratio, which is indicative of social behavior, although its sex ratio is smaller than other social species. It was first identified as distinct from Anelosimus studiosus in 2006 by Ingi Agnarsson. It is named for Oritoyacu, Ecuador, where the type specimen was collected.  Description  Specific to specimens from Ecuador, males range in size between , and females between . Specimens collected in Mexico are larger. Prosoma is brown with grey marks, while legs are pale brown, with darker brown at the tips. Males can be distinguished by the size of their embolus fork and embolus division b, while females have an epigynal plate which is high relative to its width.  Distribution  All specimens collected have come from either Mexico or Ecuador, and the specimens collected in Mexico are uncertain in their assignment to this species. The collections have come from elevations of , which are among the highest collections of a social spider in this genus. Elevation appears to play a role in sociality within the Anelosimus genus, so the high elevation has been implicated as potentially explanatory of the unusually low sex ratio and other peculiarities of this species.

Climate change in Alaska encompasses the effects of climate change in the U.S. state of Alaska. With winter temperatures increasing, the type of precipitation will change. Lack of snow cover on the ground will expose tree roots to colder soils, and yellow ceder is already showing the result of this with many trees dying. The melting of glaciers in the watershed is likely to accelerate and will cause hydrological changes that will impact the wetland habitats and the distribution of wildlife. Animals such as the black-tailed deer, moose and mountain goat may benefit from less snow cover, while such mammals as the northwestern deer mouse that tunnels under the snow are likely to be disadvantaged. The Alaska Climate Change Sub-Cabinet was established in 2006 to advise the Governor on climate change strategy, including opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through the use of alternative fuels, energy conservation, fuel efficiency, and transportation planning. Observed effects of Climate Change In August 2016, the Environmental Protection Agency reported that \\"[o]ver the past 60 years, most of the state has warmed three degrees (F) on average and six degrees during winter\\" As a result of this temperature increase, the EPA noted that \\"Arctic sea ice is retreating, shores are eroding, glaciers are shrinking, permafrost is thawing, and insect outbreaks and wildfires are becoming more common\\". The EPA further noted that these changes were likely to accelerate in the future, potentially causing infrastructure damage due to thawing permafrost, and a decline of the state's fishing industry. The temperate rainforest in southeast Alaska, in the Tongass National Forest is a perhumid (always wet) temperate rain forest.DellaSala, Dominick A. \\"Temperate and Boreal Rainforests of the Pacific Coast of North America\\". in Temperate and boreal rainforests of the world ecology and conservation. Washington, D.C.: Island Press, 2011. 41‚Äì81. Print. A perhumid temperate rainforest is a rainforest that receives above ten percent of its annual rainfall during the summer. Another contributing factor to define a perhumid rainforest is transient snow must be present in the winter with mean annual temperatures of 7 ¬∞C. These qualities define the rain forest as cool and temperate. At present, the southeast Alaskan temperate rainforest is strongly dominated by old growth stands. The vegetation is strongly represented by a series of conifers; Sitka spruce, western hemlock, mountain hemlock, amabilis fir, shore pine, western red cedar, and Alaska yellow cedar. This forest, unlike its neighboring regions to the north and south, is completely safe from fires. Fire is virtually nonexistent in the southeast region due to the moist and cool climate. Small scale windthrow is the main disturbance that affects the rain forest in this region. Temperatures and precipitation in the southeast region of Alaska for the year of 2011 have matched what a typical temperate rainforest needs to be defined as one by DellaSala. Juneau, Alaska, received 66.40 inches of precipitation and averaged 40.6 ¬∞F during 2011. Snowfall, as will be discussed in further detail later, is an important player for the temperate rainforest in this region, and the Juneau area received 115.9 inches which, converted to its liquid equivalent is 11.59 inches.\\"Juneau Climate Summary\\". Juneau Climate Summary. N.p., n.d. Web. 10 Nov. 2013. . The weather characteristics of the southeast region match up very well with what a temperate rainforest needs as defined by DellaSala. Projected effects of Climate Change Windstorms are the most relevant disturbance regime that impacts the southeast temperate rainforests. Stand-replacing wind storms happen in 100-year intervals and wind throw as a main disturbance will continue to be one of the main disturbances in the coming years. Wind protected areas that support old growth stands will become more prone to wind throw events. Stem decay and other disease agents have smaller impacts on these stands and are to be considered a finer scale and exclusive disturbance. With rising temperatures comes longer growing-season, and is predicted to increase growth rates of these fungi. Combined wind-throw events and fungi disturbances generate concern for persistence of old growth stands throughout the region. Decreasing old growth stands paves the way for an increase of early successional species taking over a greater proportion of area.Wolken, J. M., et al. 2011. \\"Evidence and implications of recent and projected climate change in Alaska's forest ecosystems\\". Ecosphere 2(11):124. doi:10.1890/ES11-00288.1 One species of tree, yellow-cedar, has already been observably impacted by the changing climate. The main disturbance to yellow- cedar in the northern part of the southeast region is lack or depletion of snow-pack. The yellow-cedar has been dying throughout an area of 200,000 hectares over the last 100 years. The yellow-cedar's fine root system is susceptible to cold soil temperatures; temperatures below ‚àí5 ¬∞C are lethal. Snow pack acts as an insulator to the trees root system. Rising temperatures means earlier snow-melt and later freeze-up dates. When insulated by snow, the temperature barrier remains in place and the tree's roots can survive. Onset of early spring freezing episodes will be detrimental to the yellow-cedar population. These changing climate factors are predicted to have a substantial influence on the condition of wildlife habitat. With increase in temperatures and a decrease of wetlands and streams raises the likelihood of fire risk, which is a prominent issue concerning the temperate rainforest. The major biophysical factor that is prevalent in many areas that contain temperate rainforests is snow and glaciers. The continual warming in this region poses major hydrological changes that may impact the rainforest in the future. These hydrological changes will impact place species distribution and wildlife habitat.  Climate Models  In order to predict how climate change might affect the southeast region of Alaska, there must be a standard of how the data will be collected and interpolated. The models used in the Scenarios Network for Alaska and Arctic Planning (SNAP) research took in to account a steady increase in carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion over the first several decades of the 21st century. As the implementation of low- emission energy alternatives becomes more prevalent, a projected decline in emissions will occur. According to SNAP, this scenario is a moderate estimate. This scenario will be the standard for how the temperate rainforest in the southeast region will be impacted in the coming decades. The southeastern region is projected to become warmer over the next century. Warmer temperatures in this region mean additional length to the growing season. These two changes in the ecosystem are likely to result in increase in evapotranspiration, enough to outweigh the increase of precipitation that is also predicted to occur throughout the region. Many scientists have already discovered typical signs of climate change in wetland drying and glacial recession. Assuming a mid-range emission scenario described as, a world of rapid economic growth, a global population that peaks mid-century, rapid introduction of new and more efficient technologies, and a balance between fossil fuels and other energy sources. By using this scenario presented by the Scenarios Network for Alaska and Arctic planning, there is a predicted increase in average annual temperature by about 3 ¬∞F by the year 2040, increasing to 6 ¬∞F by 2080. The final result would be an increase of average annual temperature from about the current 42 ¬∞F to close to 48 ¬∞F over the southeast region of Alaska. More importantly than average annual temperature rises, is in winter temperatures. Winter temperatures could dramatically rise to 42 ¬∞F from the average of 36 ¬∞F. With winter temperatures increasing, the type of precipitation will change.  Projected effects on wildlife  Climate change effects on the wildlife in temperate rainforests in the southeast region will be influenced by decreasing snow-pack and lengthening of the growing-season. Snow depth impacts foraging and herbivore animals such as blacktailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus), moose, and mountain goat (Oreamnos americanus). Protection by snow-pack is taken advantage of by the northwestern deer mouse (Peromyscus keeni); decreasing snow-pack creates habitat concern for the deermouse. Conversely, less snow for less of time means bigger area of winter range for the blacktailed deer; this would create the availability of high quality foods in spring for the black tailed deer, which would ultimately decrease winter mortality. The temperate rainforest that covers the Southeastern part of the state is a result of humid summers and transient snow cover in winter. The conifers that thrive in this moist climate are free from fire risk as compared to the forests to both the north and south. Warmer weather will lengthen the growing period of the trees and the increase in evapotranspiration is likely to outweigh the increase of precipitation. Assuming a scenario involving a mid- range increase in emissions, the average temperature may rise by about 3 ¬∞F by the year 2040 and by 6 ¬∞F by 2080. The trees will grow more vigorously but fungi that cause rot will also thrive, there is likely to be an increase in windthrow, and fire risk may rise. Climate change policy in Alaska Alaska has a total of 0.7 million residents and ranks 46th in the nation in terms of GDP, which is $41.1 billion. In 2005, Alaska ranked 26th in the nations industrial energy consumption at 417.3 trillion Btu and 4th in the nations industrial natural gas consumption at 356.7 trillion Btu. Alaskas leading industry is food manufacturing, which is responsible for 7,621 jobs, $230.2 million in payroll, and $1,925.1 million in shipments. In addition, there is one complete R&D; in Alaska. Governor Frank Murkowski created the Rural Energy Action Council to help guide Alaska's long-term energy policy. The nine- member task force will make recommendations in several areas: incentives to lower energy delivery costs, regional supply and distribution centers, cooperative fuel purchases, power plant operational efficiencies, consolidation of energy providers, a review of Alaska Energy Authority programs, acceleration of wind turbine generator installations, and energy conservation measures. The task force is responsible for reviewing and analyzing the state's current and long-term energy needs. It is to deliver its recommendations for a long-term energy plan for Railbelt Alaska by December 31, and to produce similar recommendations for Rural Alaska by March 31, 2006. In making its recommendations for state energy policy, the task force will consider the needs of Railbelt communities, which are served by the state's main power grid, and those of rural Alaskans who live off the grid for reliable and renewable sources of affordable energy. In 2018, the Climate Action Leadership Team a draft for new state-level climate policy. The draft outlined goals centered on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing usage of renewables with targets for 2025 using market-based pricing. Governor Mike Dunleavy disbanded this team via executive order shortly after he was placed in office.  Biofuels  In certain geographic areas and during months in which fuel containing ethanol is required to be sold, transferred, or used in an effort reduce emissions carbon monoxide and attain air quality standards as required by federal or state law, the tax rate on fuel containing at least 10% ethanol by volume is reduced by $0.06 per gallon as compared to the tax rate on other motor fuels. The state Department of Transportation (DOT) is required to consider using alternative fuels for automotive purposes whenever practicable. The DOT may participate in joint ventures with public or private partners that will foster the availability of alternative fuels for all consumers of automotive fuel.  Solar power =Public response to climate change in Alaska Alaska Youth for Environmental Action organized a climate strike in Anchorage in September 2019, arguing and including a petition to reinstate the Climate Action Leadership Team disbanded by Governor Dunleavy. Hundred of youth joined the march. Cassidy Austin, a 17-year-old and one of the organizers of the strike, noted that many participants were inspired by Greta Thunberg, who had recently testified before Congress.

Early life He was born in Delphos, Kansas, the son of John Sherman Truex and Estel Van Landingham Day. J. Sherman and Estel Day Truex were close associates of James Cash Penney, managing some of the earliest of Mr. Penney‚Äôs ‚ÄúGolden Rule‚Äù stores. Estel was a first cousin of Earl Sams, second president of the J. C. Penney Company. The Truexes had two sons and two daughters, none of whom had children of their own. Van, despite being a brilliant student, encountered the increasing disapproval of his father, offended by this older son‚Äôs artistic and feminine personality; hence the parents were disengaged from Van from adolescence on. He was, however, emotionally and financially supported by his aunt, Leta Day (Mrs. Bert) Nicol, another of the early Penney colleagues. After a year at the Wisconsin State Normal School in Oshkosh, Van was accepted at the New York School of Fine and Applied Art in 1923, whose president, Frank Alvah Parsons, soon became his mentor. In 1925, he was awarded a scholarship to the School‚Äôs Paris branch, the Paris Ateliers (established 1921). France was to be his second home for the rest of his life. Career Upon graduation in 1926, he joined the faculty and eventually was appointed director in Paris. In that position, he was drawn into the international set as decorator and friend and became a friend of Elsie de Wolfe. The Paris branch later evolved into Parsons Paris (autumn 2013). World War II forced his return to New York in 1939. The New York School of Applied and Fine Arts (1909‚Äì1936) ‚Äî formerly the New York School of Art (1898‚Äì1909) ‚Äî had been renamed Parsons School of Design 1936‚Äì2005, after its late co-founder, and Van Day Truex was named president. He continued his painting and presented some one-man shows. His work as designer for Grace Moore, the opera soprano, with whom he established a close friendship, mentioned in her autobiography.You‚Äôre Only Human Once by Grace Moore (1944; Doubleday, Doran). In 1951 Van Day Truex was lauded by France as a Chevalier of the Legion of Honor (Chevalier de la L√©gion d‚ÄôHonneur). The following year, however, a disagreement with the board of the Parson School led to his demotion to consultant. His next appointment was as artist-in- residence at the American Academy in Rome. Returning to New York in 1955, he was chosen by Walter Hoving, the new president of Tiffany & Co., as the director of design for the company. Meanwhile, he continued his favorite enterprise in the restoration or redecoration of homes in New York and Provence, his and others.

He is also great-great-great grandfather of second President of the United States John Adams. Biography Hawkes was born on January 25 or 26, 1605, to John Hawke and an unknown mother, in Hingham, Norfolk, England. He was then baptized January 26, 1605, at St. Andrews Church, Higham, Norfolk. Hawkes immigrated from England with the Winthrop Fleet, led by John Winthrop, in 1630. On arrival in America Hawkes first settled in Charlestown in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. In Charlestown he worked as a husbandman, holding the offices of Cow Commissioner and Surveyor. After getting married and selling his property in Charlestown in 1635, Hawkes then moved to the wilderness in Lynn (now known as Saugus) to cultivate the land and start farming. The Hawkes family were the first known settlers of this area. The first log cabin that Hawkes built came to be known as \\"Close Hill\\". Hawkes died on March 13, 1672, in Saugus. Marriages In 1631 Hawkes married Ann Hutchinson (n√©e Brown), widow of Thomas Hutchinson. Her parents were Edward Brown and Jane Brown (n√©e Lide). She was born circa 1615 in Inkberrow, Worcestershire, England, and died in Lynn, Essex County, Massachusetts on December 4, 1669. (prior to 1752 the year started with March as the first month of the calendar. The tenth month is December) With the death of his first wife, Hawkes then married Sarah Hooper, daughter of William and Elizabeth Hooper.

It is approximately three miles long and drains the western portion of a coal basin near Kelayres. It is among the largest sources of acid mine drainage into Catawissa Creek. It also contributes up to 80% of the acidity to Catawissa Creek. The Audenried Tunnel's pH is approximately 4. However, there have been somewhat successful attempts at treating the tunnel outflow in the 21st century. The bedrock in the vicinity of the tunnel is mostly shale and sandstone. Location and description The Audenried Tunnel is long. The tunnel runs between the Audenried Mine and the watershed of Catawissa Creek. It is filled with debris and the air inside the tunnel is not breathable. The tunnel roughly follows the synclinal axis of the coal basin it is in. The tunnel drains the Jeansville Coal Basin, which is located between Hazleton and McAdoo. The Audenried Tunnel is located approximately east of the community of Sheppton, Pennsylvania. The tunnel is in width and in height. When the Audenried Tunnel was first built, the first were fully lined with timber due to the low quality of the rock in that part of the tunnel. The next were also supported by timber, but to a lesser extent. In 1931, the Glen Alden Coal Company reported that from the mouth of the Audenried Tunnel, there was a fissure that discharged close to 800 gallons (approximately 211 liters) per minute. It is possible that there is a fault at this location. The Audenried Tunnel is the most downstream mine drainage tunnel to discharge into Catawissa Creek. Hydrology The Audenried Tunnel discharges into Catawissa Creek near where the Green Mountain Tunnel and the Catawissa Tunnel discharge into the creek. The Audenried Tunnel discharges in a strip mine not far from Catawissa Creek's headwaters. All of the mine workings in the Jeansville Coal Basin likely drain into the tunnel, as does some water from the surface. The discharge from the Audenried Tunnel contributes currently as much as 80% of the acid flowing through Catawissa Creek, with previous studies showing up to 84%. The average discharge of the tunnel is 12.22 million gallons per day, or about 8500 gallons per minute. However, during heavy rainstorms, the discharge can reach 300,000 gallons per minute. The pH of the water in the tunnel ranges between 3.8 and 4.1. The average pH is 4.03. The total concentration of iron in the waters at the confluence of the Audenried Tunnel and Catawissa Creek is 0.7 milligrams per liter, which equates to a load of per day. The total maximum daily load for iron is per day, which is 21% less than the current load. The total concentration of manganese at the confluence is 2.28 milligrams per liter, which equates to a load of per day. The total maximum daily load for manganese is 73% less than the current daily load. The total concentration of aluminum is 7.93 milligrams per liter, which equates to a load of per day. The total maximum daily load for aluminum is , which is 95% less than the current daily load. The total concentration of acidity is 68.08 milligrams per liter, which equates to per day. The total maximum daily load for acidity is , which is 99% less than the current load. The total concentration of alkalinity is 2.31 milligrams per liter, which equates to per day. The total concentration of sulfates in the discharge is 136.25 milligrams per liter. History The Glen Alden Coal Company commenced construction of the Audenried Tunnel in 1928. Construction of the tunnel finished in 1931. The tunnel was originally created to decrease the elevation of the area's water table without resorting to the use of pumps, thus allowing the drilling of deep coal mine shafts. It was successful in doing this, but rendered of Catawissa Creek devoid of life for 75 years. An attempt was made to map the Audenried Tunnel in 1971. However, the attempt was aborted after due to the presence of debris that was impassible. Plans were made in 1974 to plug the tunnel. In 2006, part of the treatment plant at the mouth of the Audenried Tunnel was buried by a landslide, putting it out of commission. Attempts at restoration and treatment One plan to reduce the discharge rate of the Audenried Tunnel is to reclaim land and create stream channels for Hunkydory Creek and two unnamed tributaries of Catawissa Creek. There are plans to test a way to neutralize the water in the Audenried Tunnel. The Audenried Tunnel AMD Treatment Project began in the summer of 2005, with the aim of treating the outflow of the Audenried Tunnel. The Eastern Pennsylvania Coalition for Abandoned Mine Reclamation gained $150,000 from the Office of Surface Mining for the project. The treatment cost approximately $1,900,000 and is the largest acid mine drainage treatment system in the Coal Region. Around 2000, plans were made to reroute Catawissa Creek away from the tunnel. The Audenried Tunnel AMD Treatment Project takes in water from the Audenried Tunnel and puts it in three concrete tanks that are wide and deep. The tanks are filled with 4500 tons of limestone. The treatment system raises the pH of the water by 30%. Ed Rendell, the governor of Pennsylvania when this project was worked on, granted $200,000 to the project. Geology The bedrock around the Audenried Tunnel includes red shale, sandy shale, which are both clay-like or silt-like. The shale is more weathered near the mouth of the tunnel. The bedrock near the tunnel also includes sandstone belonging to the Mauch Chunk Formation. Between and , the bedrock around the tunnel is largely sandstone. Up to , the rock near the Audenried Tunnel is mostly interbedded red shale and sandstone. However, there is also a layer of conglomerate.

It is a thin, square pizza, typically with cheese and tomatoes, and is reminiscent of pizzas cooked at home by Italian housewives without a pizza oven. The pizza is often compared to Sicilian pizza. History The origins of grandma pizza can be traced back to the early 20th century in Long Island when Italian immigrants from southern Italy would try to replicate some of the food from their home country with what few ingredients they had available. This eventually morphed into a pizza that would be made at home with simple ingredients in their kitchens. Due to the humble beginnings and background of the pizza, it was dubbed \\"grandma pizza\\" since it was rarely made outside of a home kitchen and mainly made by first-generation immigrants. Pizzerias rarely sold this type of pizza. Although having existed for decades, grandma pizza was not well known outside of Long Island and many in New York did not even know about the style. In the late 2000s and early 2010s, the pizza became more popular with many pizzerias offering it. This was mainly due to people who had grown up eating grandma pizza finally being able to open up their own pizzerias and offer the pizza as a sign of respect and homage to what they ate at home. Characteristics A grandma pizza is usually cooked in an olive-oil coated pan with the dough shaped in a rectangle. Cheese is usually placed on first with the sauce going on top of the pizza rather than under the cheese. It is then put into a regular kitchen oven to bake, although now many pizzerias also use wood-fired ovens or stone ovens. After it is done baking, it is cut into small squares for serving.

Back in New Zealand  Back in New Zealand Henry, May and Sid moved to a five-acre block of land in Mount Albert, Auckland. Around 1920 they purchased a recently completed house at 5 Arnold Street, Grey Lynn and opened a Watchmaker and Jewellery Shop at 314 Ponsonby Road near the Three Lamps.

During the 1930s the Great Depression came so the shop was closed as people did not have money for luxuries like jewellery. Henry started doing beaten copper work under the house in Arnold Road making; box curbs, fire screens and bellows. He made all his own designs and dyes and sold his works to The Farmers Trading Company in Hobson Street.

It was directed by Amit Sharma, written by Sukesh Kumar Nayak, produced by an Ogilvy India branch of Ogilvy & Mather, and published on YouTube on November 13, 2013. Reunion is about the fictional reunion between two elderly men, Baldev Mehra (Vishwa Mohan Badola) from India and Yusuf (Mysore Shrinivas Sathyu) from Pakistan. They were separated as children during the Partition of India. It has had a strong impact in both India and Pakistan, leading to hope for the easing of travel restrictions between the two countries. It went viral and was viewed more than 1.6 million times before officially debuting on television on November 15, 2013. Sequence Baldev Mehra (Vishwa Mohan Badola) is an elderly Hindu man in Delhi, India, and Yusuf (Mysore Shrinivas Sathyu) is an elderly Muslim man in Lahore, Pakistan. One day Baldev shows his granddaughter Suman (Auritra Ghosh) an old, dated photograph of two children. He tells her that it is himself and his best friend Yusuf when they lived in Lahore prior to the Partition of India in 1947. In front of his house there was a park with a gate made in the stone age and each evening he and Yusuf would fly kites there and \\"steal\\" Jhajariyas from Yusuf's family sweet shop. When Partition came, however, Baldev and his family had to leave for India overnight. Many decades later, Baldev still thinks of Yusuf and misses him. Using details of her grandfather's story, Suman is able to locate Yusuf's sweet shop in Lahore via her laptop and Google. She connects with his grandson Ali (Syed Shabahat Ali) who helps her to plan a surprise visit from Yusuf on Baldev's birthday. This is the first of a sequence of five ads showing the two old friends reconnecting.Qurratulain Zaman, This Google ad has moved people to tears across India and Pakistan.

Reception The Star notes that Reunion has \\"gone viral online, reflecting demands in the two countries for closer people-to-people ties [....] Internet users left thousands of comments on social networking sites describing how the advert had brought them to tears and renewed their hopes for improved relations between the two neighbours.\\" Max Fisher of The Washington Post states that \\"if you are from South Asia, have family from South Asia, or are merely friends on Facebook with someone who has ties to the subcontinent, you've already seen this video posted to social media in the 48 hours since it went up. In case you haven't, it's a Google advertisement, about three and a half minutes, well worth your time. Yes, it's an ad, meant to prod people in one of the world's largest markets into using Google services. And in that context it can be a bit syrupy. But take a step back for a moment, and try to appreciate what makes this video so powerful that it's already been viewed 1.8 million times.\\" India Today states that \\"the new Google ad, titled Reunion, touches the raw nerves that linger dormant under the skin of those who were separated during the heady days of Partition [‚Ä¶.] While this may have been only an ad, there are many people both in Pakistan and India who will be able to relate to this emotional ad.\\" Affan Chowdhry of The Globe and Mail states that \\"with nearly a million YouTube views over two days, a new Google ad that tells the story of two old friends reuniting after six decades of separation following the creation of India and Pakistan in 1947 has touched a deep nerve for many South Asians.\\" Nilanjana Bhowmick of Time observes that \\"despite the tensions between the governments of India and Pakistan, this commercial, released by Google India on Wednesday, makes the point that the personal connections between Indians and Pakistanis run deep.\\" Journalist Beena Sarwar states that \\"if it doesn‚Äôt move you, you‚Äôve got a heart of stone.\\" Sunny Peter of the International Business Times argues that \\"at a time when governments in both countries continue to be suspicious of each other's intent, the Google video comes as a welcome relief. [If only] the visa regime between both the countries was as easy as Google search.\\" Ritu Singh of Zee News states that Reunion struck \\"an emotional chord with its viewers not only in India but also in Pakistan\\" as it \\"depicts the pain of partition which still haunts the mind of people who got separated from their loved ones and places.\\" She also states, \\"this heart warming ad is sure to overwhelm you.\\" Mrigaa Sethi of Quartz talks about her family's experience with partition, noting that \\"Google‚Äôs India office has created a tear-jerker ad that is deeply resonant for Indians and Pakistanis with family stories like mine. It shows an aging Hindu Indian man waxing nostalgic to his granddaughter about his Muslim childhood friend in Lahore before the partition [....] The ad, created by Ogilvy, has struck a particularly emotional chord by refusing to take India and Pakistan‚Äôs historically adversarial relationship as a given.\\" ReferencesExternal links *Official website Category:Advertisements Category:Advertising campaigns Category:Google Search Category:Advertising in India Category:Partition of India in fiction Category:India‚ÄìPakistan relations in popular culture Category:Viral videos Category:2013 in Indian television Category:2013 works ","title":"Reunion (advertisement)"},{"id":"41094297","text":"Jorge Enrique Lage (Havana, 1979) is a Cuban novelist and short story writer.

He was a member of the family of the hereditary viscounts of Ausona, whose chief castle was at Cardona, although they also controlled the upper town of Vic itself. His mother was the viscountess Ermetruit, who made a donation to the diocese while her son was bishop. In 985, before he became bishop, Arnulf was captured during a raid by Almanzor and held for ransom in C√≥rdoba. After his release, he was elected to replace Froia, who was murdered by the supporters of an anti-bishop in 992. Arnulf's younger brother, the viscount of Ausona, recognised the overlordship of the bishop in the upper town. In the mid- eleventh century, the viscount's authority in the upper town was replaced by that of the seneschal of the count of Barcelona when the latter inherited Ausona. The lack of jurisdictional clarity that began in Arnulf's time led to open warfare between the bishops and the seneschals in the thirteenth century. In 1010, Count Ramon Borrell of Barcelona, taking advantage of the Andalusian fitna (civil war), invaded the caliphate of C√≥rdoba. Arnulf took part in the expedition and was killed in battle.

Inner Relationship Focusing is a process for emotional healing, and for accessing positive energy and insights for forward movement in one's life. Cornell, while a graduate student in Linguistics at the University of Chicago, met Gendlin in 1972 and learned his technique. In 1980 she began collaborating with him in teaching his Focusing workshops.Cornell, Ann Weiser. Focusing in Clinical Practice: The Essence of Change. W. W. Norton & Company, 2013. p. xxxi. Using her capacity for linguistics, Cornell helped develop the concept of Focusing guiding, and in the early 1980s she offered the first seminars on Focusing guiding.Kirschner, Ellen. \\"FOCUS ON: Ann Weiser Cornell\\". Staying in Focus: The Focusing Institute Newsletter. Vol. IV, No. 2. May 2004. Her continuation of this process led to her development, with Barbara McGavin, of Inner Relationship Focusing. History Inner Relationship Focusing took shape when Ann Weiser Cornell moved from Chicago to California in 1983 and began teaching Focusing to people who knew nothing about it. She discovered that many people who were not automatically adept at it needed new techniques and new language to draw out their ability to learn the process. Eventually her discoveries of what worked best for the majority of people, combined with the input, inspiration, and insights of her British collaborator Barbara McGavin,McGavin, Barbara. \\"The ‚ÄòVictim‚Äô, the ‚ÄòCritic‚Äô and the Inner Relationship: Focusing with the Part that Wants to Die\\".

Description Inner Relationship Focusing is a refined and expanded form of Eugene Gendlin's original six-step process of Focusing, which he had detailed in his 1978 book of the same title.Gendlin, Eugene. Focusing. Bantam Books, 1978. Inner Relationship Focusing emphasizes being in gentle, allowing relationship with all parts of one's being, including parts that are in conflict, parts often denied or pushed away as unacceptable or demeaning, parts that are overwhelming, and parts that are so buried or subtle they need to be drawn out with patience and gentleness.Brenner, Helen G. I Know I'm in There Somewhere: A Woman's Guide to Finding Her Inner Voice and Living a Life of Authenticity. Penguin, 2004. p. 51.Cornell, Ann Weiser. \\"The Origins and Development of Inner Relationship Focusing\\". In: Cornell, Ann Weiser and Barbara McGavin.

In allowing all aspects of the personality to be held in acceptance and awareness, new insights and shifts can emerge and healing can occur.Bray, Joseph. \\"The wisdom of the body\\" . Therapy Today. Volume 22, Issue 1; February 2011.Daffner, Diana. Tantric Sex for Busy Couples: How to Deepen Your Passion in Just Ten Minutes a Day. Hunter House, 2009. p. 185.\\"What is Inner Relationship Focusing?\\" . GreyLynnCounselling.co.nz. Inner Relationship Focusing therefore emphasizes the relationship of the Self with the various inner aspects, however painful, and it relies specifically on a quality of Presence, or the ability of the Self to be present with these aspects in a quality of friendliness, gentle curiosity, and nonjudgment. A major feature of IRF is gently finding out how a specific aspect or felt experience feels from its point of view. Another feature is giving awareness to parts of oneself that are opposing ‚Äì either afraid of or objecting to ‚Äì a difficult or troublesome part. Inner Relationship Focusing radically allows and accepts all parts or inner experiences. It also avoids the extremes of denial/\\"exile\\" and merging/identification/overwhelm, through using the quality of Presence to gently experience and navigate one's inner world in a calm, detached, but gently curious and inviting way. Differences from Gendlin's original Focusing Eugene Gendlin's original Focusing process, described in his 1978 book, is a process that he generalizes as having six steps: clearing a space, allowing a \\"felt sense\\" to form, finding a handle, resonating, asking, and receiving.Gendlin, Eugene. Focusing. Bantam Books, 1978. pp. 103‚Äì107. Inner Relationship Focusing, developed in the late 1980s through the late 1990s, is a more fluid process, and eschews or modifies certain aspects of Gendlin's. For instance, rather than clearing a space, IRF uses a mental scan of the body for what feels open and alive, and what needs acknowledging ‚Äì without moving any issue \\"out\\" ‚Äì in order to more fully accept or find what may be wanting attention.Cornell, Ann Weiser and Barbara McGavin. \\"Gendlin's Focusing Terms ‚Äì Definitions and Comparisons\\".

An important principle in Inner Relationship Focusing is not denying or exiling any thoughts, feelings, or partial selves ‚Äì not even the inner critic ‚Äì but rather empathizing with all parts and aspects and sensing what they want to communicate and why.Kugel, Jennifer A. \\"An Inner Relationship Focusing Approach to Transforming the Inner Critic.\\" PhD diss., Alliant International University, California School of Professional Psychology, San Diego, 2010. Cornell calls this \\"the radical acceptance of everything\\".Cornell, Ann Weiser and Barbara McGavin. The Radical Acceptance of Everything: Living a Focusing Life. Calluna Press, 2005. Another central principle is the aspect of Presence, or \\"Self-in-Presence\\": gentle listening, with equanimity, to everything that comes up in the Focusing process.Cornell, Ann Weiser and Barbara McGavin. The Focusing Student's and Companion's Manual, Volume 1. Calluna Press, 2002. pp. 57‚Äì60. In addition, specific language and language/thought patterns are encouraged, which Cornell calls \\"Presence language\\", in order to facilitate this process. And as indicated by its name, Inner Relationship Focusing gives high priority to the relationship of the Focuser to his inwardly felt experience or aspects of his inner life. The role of the guide, if one is used, is to support this relationship.Van Nuys, David. \\"Focusing with Ann Weiser Cornell\\". Shrink Rap. July 30, 2009.

Early life and education Janus was born in the Catskills Mountains and practiced paganism throughout her childhood. Growing up, she began singing opera before becoming interested in thrash metal as a teen. For her post- secondary education, Janus attended the American Musical and Dramatic Academy. Career Janus started her music career working as a topless disc jockey under the name Penelope Tuesdae. She also worked in cabaret at the Windows on the World until the night before the September 11 attacks in New York. In 2003, Janus began her career in metal as a member of Vexy Strut and remained with the band until 2006. In 2009, she recruited members of the metal band Professor to join her newly formed band Huntress. With Huntress, she was the lead singer during the band's three studio albums, the last of which was Static in 2015. In the fall of 2015, Janus announced to social media that Huntress was breaking up. She was later refuted by the band's guitarist Blake Meahl citing her mental health issues. Apart from her albums with Huntress, Janus filled in for Amon Amarth's lead singer Johan Hegg during a 2015 co-tour with Huntress. Janus's other projects outside of Huntress included membership of cover bands Chelsea Girls and The Starbreakers as their lead singer. She also co-wrote Victory: The Rock Opera with guitarist Angus Clark. Janus also recorded vocals for Brian Posehn's album Grandpa Metal, which was released in 2020, featuring her performances on the song \\"Goblin Love\\" as well as a cover of \\"Take On Me\\". Artistry Janus's musical influences ranged from rock to heavy metal. In rock, Janus named Ann Wilson as an influence while citing Freddie Mercury as one of her vocal inspirations. With heavy metal, Janus listed Rob Halford, King Diamond and Jared Warren as a few of her favourite singers. Janus said she had a four octave vocal range as a coloratura soprano. While she was in Huntress, Janus stated that each Huntress album respectively focused on a part of her life. Janus based each of the Huntress' albums on a part of the Triple Goddess in neopaganism. Personal life In 2015, Janus disclosed to Revolver that she was living with bipolar disorder since her early teens, and has had numerous suicide attempts, as early as age of 16. She was diagnosed with manic depression at age 20, then later diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. Later in her life, she was experiencing dissociative identity disorder, schizophrenia and alcoholism. That same year, Janus underwent a hysterectomy after she was diagnosed with uterine cancer. Death On August 14, 2018, Janus died by suicide near Portland, Oregon. Some sources claim she died at the age of 43, though she said she was born in September 1975 making her 42 at the time.

They were detained without trial as per Defence of India Act, 1962. The internees were released in phase by phase manner until the last internee was released in 1967. After the internment, many Chinese-Indians (Indians with Chinese ancestry) were resettled with equal right; and, some were deported or coerced to leave India. Nearly all internees had their properties sold off or looted. Indian officials openly compare the internment of Chinese-Indians with the internment of Japanese-Americans during WWII. However, unlike the United States, the Indian government has not apologised or offered compensation to the internees. Background=Chinese community in India The earliest recorded Chinese settlers in British India arrived in Calcutta in 1780. Because of the long history of tea cultivation in China, the British used \\"fair and unfair means\\" to lure experienced workers from China to work on the newly established tea plantations in Assam, starting in 1838. Other Chinese migrants were refugees from poverty, famine, and disasters in China. By the late 19th century, the people of Chinese origin had gained a reputation as craftsmen and traders in eastern India. During World War II and the ensuing Communist revolution in China, a large wave of Chinese war refugees settled in Calcutta, North Bengal, and Northeast India. Estimates of the ethnic Chinese population in 1962 varied from 20,000 to 60,000. 1962 Sino-Indian War Following the independence of the Republic of India in 1947 and the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, the two countries enjoyed a period of friendly relationship, despite having unresolved border disputes in the areas of NEFA and Aksai Chin. The relationship deteriorated, however, after the construction of a Chinese highway in Aksai Chin in 1957, and India's support of the failed 1959 Tibetan uprising against Chinese rule. The hostilities culminated in the brief 1962 Sino-Indian War, resulting in a Chinese victory but no change in the effective boundary between the two countries. The fighting lasted from 10 October to 20 November 1962. On 21 November, China declared ceasefire and withdrew from NEFA, the larger of the two disputed territories, but kept the smaller Aksai Chin. Anti-Chinese sentiment After the outbreak of the war, the Indian government and some members of academia systematically portrayed the Chinese minority as untrustworthy and deceitful. The rising nationalism in India entailed assaults on the ethnic Chinese, including Indian citizens and residents who had lived in India for generations. Many Chinese schools and media were shut down, and people of Chinese descent were assaulted by mainstream Indians; their property, restaurants, and shops damaged. The civil liberties of the ethnic Chinese were curtailed. People of Chinese descent were required to report to the authorities for \\"registration and classification\\", and it became harder for non-citizens to meet the residency requirements. The legal definition of foreigners was extended to include Indian citizens of Chinese descent. Faced with widespread hostility, many Chinese-Indians expressed their support and loyalty for the Indian cause, condemned the Chinese government, and donated to India's defence funds. However, their expressions of support were met with suspicion and contempt. Internment and deportation After its defeat in the war, India passed the Defence of India Act in December 1962, permitting the \\"apprehension and detention in custody of any person [suspected] of being of hostile origin.\\" The broad language of the act allowed for the arrest of any person simply for having a Chinese surname or a Chinese spouse. Under this law, 10,000 people of Chinese origin were estimated to have been detained from all over India, including Calcutta, Bombay, Darjeeling, Kalimpong, Jamshedpur, and the Northeast. All of them were accused of being spies, but not a single charge has ever been proven. The internment of Chinese-Indians violated both the Constitution of India and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, to which India was an original signatory. Starting in November 1962, many ethnic Chinese were given the order to leave India within a month. About 7,500 people complied and left for various countries including China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Pakistan, Japan, Australia, Britain, United States, and Canada. People who could not raise travel expenses or were unwilling to leave were imprisoned. While some were held in local prisons, thousands more were transported across India to the desert prison camp in Deoli, Rajasthan, built by the British in 1942 as a POW camp for Japanese, German, and Italian combatants during WWII. The camp housed 7,000 inmates, 60% of whom were children or elderly people. Many internees, unaccustomed to the hot desert climate, died of heat stroke and related diseases. In 1964, the Deoli prison authorities announced that all internees would be deported to China. The forcible deportations were arbitrary, resulting in the breakup of many families. In many cases parents were separated from their children and never heard from them again. The deportations stopped after a few months, and the government offered the remaining inmates the option to migrate to China. Some took the offer, but about 2,500 chose to stay and wait for the chance to return home. In 1965, the Indian government began to release the internees. They were allowed to leave the camp in small batches. The last internees were released from Deoli in mid-1967, after four and half years of captivity. However, when the internees were transported to their old neighbourhoods, the local governments often did not know what to do with them and kept them in local prisons, in some cases for more than a year. Aftermath After the internees were freed after years of incarceration, many discovered that their properties had been sold off in their absence, but were only offered tiny sums for compensation. Almost all internees had their homes, shops, and factories looted or taken over by locals. The Chinese population in Calcutta decreased by half, from 20,000 to 10,000. Those who remained were seen as enemies, and most could not hold any job except in the restaurant, tanning, and shoemaking businesses. Moreover, their movements were restricted. Until the mid-1980s, the Chinese-Indians were required to report to designated police stations once a month; until the mid-1990s, they had to apply for special permits to travel more than a few kilometres from their homes. Reaction Indian officials openly compare the internment of Chinese-Indians with the internment of Japanese-Americans during WWII. However, unlike the United States, the Indian government has refused to apologise or offer compensation to the internees for their incarceration. When asked about his opinion on the issue in 2008, Mao Siwei, China's consul general in Calcutta, replied that China would rather \\"look forward and not argue too much about the past\\". The Indian Chinese Association has been pressuring the Indian government to issue an apology, without success. The Association of India Deoli Camp Internees, a Canadian non-profit group, has written two open letters to Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, but has not received a reply. In 2004, Rafeeq Ellias recounted the appalling treatment of the Chinese residents in Calcutta in the documentary film The Legend of Fat Mama. The documentary won the Silver Lotus Award for best anthropological / ethnographic film at the 52nd National Film Awards.

Dolan (1922‚Äì2013) was a longtime member of the Massachusetts State Legislature and an advocate of conservation. During his tenure in office as a State Representative, Dolan helped create groundbreaking legislation for the conservation of natural resources in the State of Massachusetts.Obit. Boston Globe June 23, 2013, J.M. Lawrence  Early life and military service  Dolan was born in Ipswich, Massachusetts on September 7, 1922 and was the oldest child of Charles L. Dolan and Rose Kilborn. Often called \\"Jack\\" from the time of childhood, Dolan spent his early years on Grape Island (Essex County, Massachusetts) where his mother's family had resided for many years. Dolan's uncle was Lewis Kilborn, who would later become the island's last living residents. During the early years of the 20th Century, Grape Island was home to numerous families, most of whom made their living digging clams or fishing in the Atlantic or the nearby rivers. As Dolan would later remember, \\"My first chore was to keep the wood box behind the stove full. When the big wood box was half full, sometimes I would crawl in and take a nap.\\" In the early 1930s, Dolan's father moved the family off the island and into a residence in Ipswich proper. The transition proved difficult for Dolan's mother who would suffer a nervous breakdown. In 1934, Jack Dolan was sent to live at the Hillside School for Boys in Marlborough, Massachusetts where he would remain until his enlistment in the US Navy in 1942.\\"Ipswich Remembers John 'Jack' Dolan\\", Beverly Perna, Ipswich Chronicle, June 9, 2013 During the Second World War Dolan would serve on board the transport vessel and later as a gun crew captain on the . In July 1945, Dolan and his shipmates on board the Chicago participated in the first naval bombardment of Japan against the Kamaishi Industrial District. After the war, Dolan returned to Ipswich, where he married Lucy Eustace and soon entered local politics.Obit. Salem News, May 27, 2013  Political career  While still a member of the US Naval Reserve, Dolan served in a local veteran's affairs office and was later elected to the office of Town Clerk in Ipswich. When the Korean War began in the summer of 1950, Dolan was recalled to active duty with the US Navy and was stationed in Japan. However, the death of his younger brother James F. Dolan during the Battle of Taejon led to Dolan's eventual discharge from active duty and he soon returned to Ipswich to continue raising his family and pursuing a career in state politics. In 1957, Dolan filed the bill that would become the Conservation Commission Act, legislation that enabled communities throughout Massachusetts to create conservation commissions in order to protect natural resources. By the following year, a dozen towns, including Ipswich had formed commissions based on Dolan's bill. Today, every city and town in Massachusetts has their own conservation commission. Dolan would go on to serve his district until the early 1970s and held his seat in the Massachusetts Legislature for nine consecutive terms. His tenure in office eventually came to an end after casting the deciding vote on a measure that would have reduced the size of the House assembly. The unpopular move lead to his defeat in the following year's primary.  Later life  After his defeat in the 1971 primaries, Dolan continued as director for Committee on Natural Resources until his retirement in the late 1970s. Dolan spent the remainder of his life in Ipswich, digging clams and enjoying time with his grandchildren and a great-grandson who was named in his honor. Dolan also wrote a series of historical articles for the Ipswich Chronicle in the 1990s. One of his grandsons is Samuel K. Dolan, an Emmy Award winning documentary producer with Flight 33 Productions. John F. Dolan died at his home in Ipswich at the age of 90 on May 24, 2013.Obituaries, John F.
