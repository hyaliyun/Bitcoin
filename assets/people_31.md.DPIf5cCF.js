Moldenhauer (n√©e Gatz, March 15, 1928 ‚Äì February 14, 2016) was an American high school mathematics teacher and two-time winner of the Edyth May Sliffe Award. Education Moldenhauer's father served in the United States Army. She was born in Omaha, Nebraska, and attended Benson High School in Omaha. She graduated in 1949 from the Iowa State College, with a degree in physics, hoping to go on to a research career in physics but blocked from that goal because there were few places for women in physics at the time. Career After graduating from Iowa State, Moldenhauer became a high school mathematics teacher in Omaha, and two years later became a student again at the University of Minnesota. She completed a master's degree in mathematics at Minnesota in 1952, and started work as an electrical engineer at General Electric. Her job there involved the development of fire-control systems for military aircraft. However, bored with her work, she soon returned to high school teaching. In 1955 she became a high school teacher in Schenectady, New York, where she had been working for General Electric, and in 1956 she moved to Davis Senior High School in Davis, California. After 50 years as a teacher in Davis, Moldenhauer retired in 2006. Contributions and recognition Moldenhauer won the Edyth May Sliffe Award for Distinguished High School Mathematics Teaching of the Mathematical Association of America twice, in 1990 and 2001. She was also a winner of Stanford University's Frederick Emmons Terman Engineering Award, given annually by the graduating engineering students at Stanford to a distinguished high school teacher.

In organic chemistry, a methylidene group is any part of a molecule that consists of two hydrogen atoms bound to a carbon atom, which is connected to the remainder of the molecule by a double bond.

This stands in contrast to methylene, also called methylene bridge, i.e. the ‚àíCH2‚àí group, which is connected to the rest of the molecule by two single bonds. The distinction is often important, because the double bond is chemically different from two single bonds. 3-Methylidenecycloprop-1-ene is named as a cyclopropene with a methylidene substituent. The same name (methylidene) is used for the radical , which is a molecule unto itself, also known as carbene.

It was republished in 1854 with notes and illustrations by Russell Trall. A condensed version was published in 1873, edited by Professor Francis William Newman for the Vegetarian Society. Description Smith cited research from anatomy, chemistry, history, and physiology that the natural food of man is a vegetarian diet. Smith cited the Bible as evidence that fruit and farinacea are the original food of man in the Garden of Eden before the fall of man. Fruits and Farinacea: The Proper Food of Man. (1846). Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal 65: 190‚Äì204.Fruits and Farinacea: The Proper Food of Man. (1849). Monthly Journal of Medical Science 9: 1218‚Äì1226. He documented how ancient peoples mentioned in the Bible and early nations lived on a fruit and farinaceous diet. Smith argued from the shape and size of human teeth, conformation of the jaw, length of alimentary canal and other anatomical evidence that man was not intended to be either carnivorous or omnivorous. He stated that a vegetarian diet is sufficient to maintain physical activity and strength, extremes of temperature and warm climates are best endured on a vegetarian rather than a meat diet.Fruits and Farinacea: The Proper Food of Man. (1846) The Medico-Chirurgical Review 48: 378‚Äì388. He argued that food derived from animals is the main cause of severe diseases and the constant use of animal food causes gout, rheumatism and many other disorders. Smith believed that a vegetarian diet is more pleasurable and favourable to mental vigour and the development of moral faculties and is best favourable to good health and longevity. The 1845 edition was dedicated to William Lambe. Historian James Gregory has described the book as a \\"major text\\" for the vegetarian movement.Gregory, James. (2007). Of Victorians and Vegetarians: The Vegetarian Movement in Nineteenth-Century Britain. Tauris Academic Studies. p. 39. Reception The book was negatively reviewed in many medical journals for using outdated sources from ancient history or utilizing incorrect arguments from physiology. The earliest reviews of the book were most favourable. It was positively reviewed in the Provincial Medical and Surgical Journal in 1845, which described it as a \\"curious and interesting work\\". Fruits and Farinacea: The Proper Food of Man. (1845). Provincial Medical and Surgical Journal 9: 628. The Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal gave the book a detailed fourteen page review which was supportive of Smith's arguments against excessive meat consumption but recommended a mixed diet as the most suitable. In 1846, The Medico-Chirurgical Review commented: A reviewer in the Monthly Journal of Medical Science in 1849 took issue with the book because many of the cases Smith cited of individuals and communities of people living on a vegetable diet were not living on a strict vegetable diet, as they were also consuming milk. Smith's book appeared to argue for an ovo-lacto vegetarian diet but this was never specified. This also contradicted his statement that \\"vegetables contain all the elements and qualities necessary for the complete nutrition of man.\\" The reviewer agreed with Smith that many people eat too much meat but concluded the book was too extreme in promoting the total exclusion of all meat from the diet. The New York Medical Gazette and Journal of Health praised Smith's writing and described it as \\"the best book on the subject, and immeasurably superior to any which have been written here in this department.\\" However, the reviewer criticized Russell Trall's added notes as a salesman advertisement for other publications.Fruits and Farinacea: The Proper Food of Man. (1854). New York Medical Gazette and Journal of Health 5: 426‚Äì427. A reviewer in the New Hampshire Journal of Medicine in 1854 was unconvinced by Smith's arguments against meat and also criticized the notes of Russell Trall as shameless sales promotion.Fruits and Farinacea: The Proper Food of Man. (1854). New Hampshire Journal of Medicine 4: 335‚Äì336. A review in the Chemical News and Journal of Industrial Science in 1874, commented that Smiths \\"arguments and proofs are in the main so unsatisfactory, that we are more inclined than ever to be omnivorous\\".Fruits and Farinacea: The Proper Food of Man. (1874). Chemical News and Journal of Industrial Science 29: 204. It was negatively reviewed in the Quarterly Journal of Science which concluded that \\"we have been unable to find a trace of sound logic or convincing argument in the whole book, and are more than ever assured that our omnivorous diet is the right one.\\"Fruits and Farinacea: The Proper Food of Man. (1874). Quarterly Journal of Science 11: 239‚Äì240. The British Medical Journal attacked the book in a 1897 review as non- scientific.Reviewed Work: Fruits And Farinacea The Proper Food Of Man. Vol. IV by John Smith, C. W. Forward. (1897). The British Medical Journal 2 (1911): 405. The review noted that Smith utilized sources from ancient history which are obsolete from scientific advances and that his arguments from religion were \\"fanciful\\". The book was mocked for making incorrect claims from physiology. For example, Smith was unaware about the function of the pancreas and made the false suggestion that it secretes nitrogen if it lacks in food. Other works In 1860, Smith authored Principles and Practice of Vegetarian Cookery, an ovo-lacto vegetarian cookbook.

It is included on the National Register of Historic Places Architecture St. Luke‚Äôs Church has had three structures. The first, built in 1854, was Richard Upjohn design. The Vestry paid $2,000 for the lot on the corner of Main and 4th in Jamestown, where the current church now stands. The first cornerstone of the church was laid on September 27, 1854, and it was consecrated on May 6, 1856. On the Sunday before Christmas 1862, a defective flue caused a fire in the structure, and the church burned down. The flames could not be brought under control because Jamestown did not have a village water system at that time. The parish immediately started on reconstruction, using the foundation and the architectural plans of the previous church. The cornerstone for the second structure was laid on June 18, 1863. In January 1890, the parish received a large bequest from Mary Prendergast. Under the terms of her will, St. Luke‚Äôs received $125,000 to build a fireproof stone church in memory of her daughter, Catherine. The cornerstone of the new church was laid on November 29, 1892. The church is a structure of rock-faced Medina sandstone, which blends Late Gothic Revival and Romanesque Revival elements. It was designed by William P. Wentworth. The structure has a traditional cruciform plan with a square bell tower attached to the northeast corner of the church. The tower features a clock on each face side and rounded corners topped with conical pinnacle. Intact interior, original lamb stained glass windows, an arcaded fa√ßade with a porch and narthex, and a stone tracery in the west facing Rose Window are also within the church.

Travis Kalanick, who would go on to run the company and be its largest shareholder before being removed as CEO, was originally brought in as an advisor with its first employee Ryan Graves as its CEO. The book explains how Kalanick came to replace Graves, who stayed on with the company, and gain control over the start-up. According to the book, Kalanick was bitter about how venture capitalists (VC) treated his first start-up, Scour and vowed to not be replaceable by them in the future. The book details the work hard play hard culture of Uber, including a party in Las Vegas to celebrate 1 billion in revenues. It also examines the many scandals experienced by the company including allegations of sexual harassment documented by Susan Fowler, how it attempted to keep regulators from seeing Uber drivers to avoid fines, and the mishandling personal information, including in the case of a rape victim in India. It also looks at the ways the despite these negative stories, the company was well regarded by the VC community on its way to being a unicorn, and for a time, one of the highest valued private companies in Silicon Valley.

His research concentrated on the morphology of postcranial remains to understand the evolution of locomotion in the hominin clade. He was the author of the Guide to Fossil Man, the first English publication to review the hominin fossil record. Day eventually worked in the Department of Anatomy at the Middlesex Hospital Medical School and served as the Chair of Anatomy at St. Thomas‚Äôs Hospital Medical School until his retirement.  Early Life and Education  Day was born in the North Kensington neighborhood of London, England. When he was 13, his family evacuated London and moved to Sevenoaks during The Blitz of World War II. He graduated secondary school from the prestigious Sevenoaks School in Kent. In 1945, he joined the Royal Air Force where he served as a Lancaster bomber mechanic in the Middle East for three years. Immediately following his service, Day began pursuing his medical degree at the Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine (RFHSM), qualifying in 1954. Day joined the Anatomy Department at RFHSM with the initial intent of becoming an orthopedic surgeon. However, when John Napier created the Unit of Primatology and Human Evolution (within the Anatomy Department) in 1954, Day was inspired to pursue a career in hominin evolution and abandon his plans to become an orthopedic surgeon. Consequently, he enrolled at the University of London and obtained his PhD in 1962 by defending his thesis on the blood supply to the lumbo-sacral plexus.  Career and Research  After graduating in 1962, Day joined Napier at the Unit of Primatology and Human Evolution. From the award of his PhD to 1964, Day published four articles, two on his own and two in conjunction with Napier, that reflect his collaboration with Napier on the human hand. During the early 1960s, Napier worked alongside Wilfrid Le Gros Clark, who was conducting research at the Department of Anatomy at Oxford University, interpreting ape postcranial fossils excavated from Kenya by Mary and Louis Leakey. This relationship paved the way for Day‚Äôs research trip to Olduvai Gorge, Kenya when Le Gros Clark recommended Napier, who recommended Day, to Mary Leakey for the trip. Day and Napier studied the OH 8 foot bones found in Bed I, eventually concluding that the specimen belongs to Homo habilis rather than to Paranthropus boisei because of its morphological features that indicated obligatory bipedalism (Day and Napier, 1964). Day and Napier collaborated in a second publication (Day and Napier 1966) writing about OH 10 and Day wrote a solo paper about the OH 7 hand bones the next year (Day, 1967). Mary Leakey took charge of the research at Olduvai Gorge during the late 1960s and Day consequently became her go-to anatomist for understanding fossil evidence. From the late 1960s through the 1970s, Day was particularly prolific in publishing on postcranial evidence excavated from the Leakey expeditions. Notably, Day collaborated with Bernard Wood in an analysis of the OH 8 talus (Day and Wood, 1968), associated the OH 20 proximal femur with australopith remains found in South Africa (Day, 1969a), interpreted the OH 28 femur and pelvis (Day, 1971), and investigated the Laetoli footprints using photogrammetry (Day and Wickens, 1980). Additionally, Day published on cranial evidence from the Omo Crania (Day, 1969b) and from the Ngaloba cranium (Day et al, 1980), as well as publications that addressed the vexed problem of how to define Homo sapiens. Day published a wide-ranging review and analysis of the hominin fossil record called the Guide to Fossil Man. Day published four versions: two in 1976, one in 1978, and the final version in 1986. This comprehensive publication remains popular among paleoanthropologists and students worldwide today. Day met his wife of 70 years, Jos√© (Micky) Ashton, at the RFHSM shortly before leaving to teach at The Middlesex Hospital Medical School.

The decommissioned, land-bound passenger ship is placed on a railway bridge that crosses an inner-city arterial road, and is regarded as one of the most spectacular nightlife spots of the city.  History and Description  = Use as a passenger ship (1950‚Äì2016) = The ship, which has a length of , a width of and a capacity of 400 passengers, was built by the Deggendorfer Werft und Eisenbau Gesellschaft in 1949 and she was used as a passenger ship MS Utting on the Ammersee lake in Upper Bavaria from 1950 to 2016. = Use as a nightlife spot (since 2018) = The ship was decommissioned in 2016 and then bought by the Kulturverein Wannda e.V. in Munich, which by then already had made a name for itself with other subcultural projects such as the nightclub Bahnw√§rter Thiel or the permanent festival Wannda Circus, and which was able to finance the project from the revenues of these event locations. On 21 and 22 February 2017 the hull of the ship and the superstructures were transported from the Ammersee lake to Munich. For the night-time transport to Munich, the Autobahn had to be closed by the police. After its arrival in Munich, the 144-ton ship was deployed on a former railway bridge close to the Wholesale Market Munich that crosses an inner-city arterial road, and the conversion to a nightlife and cultural venue started. Due to tremendous static and safety- relevant requirements the opening of the venue was delayed for more than one year. On 12 July 2018 the former ship was christened to the name Alte Utting on the railway bridge by the head of the municipal planning and building control office Julia Sch√∂nfeld-Knor. After completion of the reconstruction measures, the party ship is opened daily since the 26 July 2018 and is primarily used as a bar, restaurant, discoth√®que (in the engine room), music venue and cabaret stage. As the Alte Utting quickly established itself as an attraction that is known far beyond the city borders, local politicians plan to preserve it permanently. Reception The Alte Utting and its cultural events regularly receive media attention by local, nationwide and international media. The New York Times described the Alte Utting as an example of hip night life spots in Munich \\"that could give Berlin a run for its money\\". According to the S√ºddeutsche Zeitung, the Alte Utting has become \\"a kind of landmark\\" of the city of Munich.

From 1882 to 1921 all of Ireland was represented by a single side, the Ireland national football team, organised by the Irish Football Association (IFA). In 1920 Ireland was partitioned into Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland. In 1922, The south of Ireland gained independence as the Irish Free State, later to become Republic of Ireland. Amid these political upheavals, a rival football association, the Football Association of Ireland (the F.A.I.), emerged in Dublin in 1921 and organised a separate league and later a national team. In 1923, during a period when the home nations had dis-affiliated from the governing body, Google books the FAI was recognised by FIFA as the governing body of the Irish Free State on the condition that it changed its name to the Football Association of the Irish Free State. At the same time, the IFA continued to organise its national team on an all-Ireland basis, regularly calling up Free State players. During this era at least one Northerner, Harry Chatton, also played for the Irish Free State and from 1936, the FAI began to organise their own all‚ÄìIreland team. Both teams now competed as Ireland and during this era at least 39 dual internationals were selected to represent both teams. Between 1928 and 1946 the IFA were not affiliated to FIFA and the two Ireland teams co-existed, never competing in the same competition. In April 1951, FIFA decreed that the IFA team could not select \\"citizens of Eire\\". An exception was for British Home Championship games, as a 1923 IFAB agreement at Liverpool prevented FIFA intervention in relations between the four Home Nations. However, the exception would only apply \\"if the F.A. of Ireland do not object\\", and was never availed of. At FIFA's 1953 congress, its Rule 3 was amended so that an international team must use \\"that title ... recognised politically and geographically of the countries or territories\\". The FAI initially claimed Rule 3 gave them the right to the name Ireland (see names of the Irish state), but FIFA subsequently ruled neither team could be referred to as Ireland, decreeing that the FAI team be officially designated as the Republic of Ireland, while the IFA team was to become Northern Ireland. The IFA objected and in 1954 was permitted to continue using the name Ireland in Home Internationals, based on the 1923 agreement. This practice was discontinued in the late 1970s.Matthew Taylor (2008). The Association Game: A History of British Football. Harlow:Pearson Education Ltd.

It is home to diverse communities of plants and animals, including several endemic species. Setting The Somali Acacia-Commiphora bushlands and thickets ecoregion occupies most of the Horn of Africa east and south of the Ethiopian Highlands, including eastern Ethiopia's Ogaden plateau and adjacent parts of Somalia and northeastern Kenya. It also extends along the floor of the East African Rift, bisecting the Ethiopian highlands, and along the northeastern edge of the highlands into Eritrea and Sudan. The ecoregion is bounded on the southwest by the Northern Acacia-Commiphora bushlands and thickets and the Masai xeric grasslands and shrublands. To the south, it is bounded by the humid Northern Zanzibar-Inhambane coastal forest mosaic in the lower Shebelle- Jubba River valley. The Hobyo grasslands and shrublands occupy a narrow strip of coastal dunes along Somalia's central Indian Ocean coast. To the northeast, the Somali montane xeric woodlands occupy the Ogo Mountains along Somalia's northern coast, and the Ethiopian xeric grasslands and shrublands occupy the lowlands along the Red Sea. Between 1100 and 1500 meters elevation in the Ethiopian Higlands, the Acacia-Commiphora woodlands transition to the Ethiopian montane forests. Climate The ecoregion has a hot semi-arid to hot desert climate. Rainfall ranges from below 100 mm annually in the Ogaden to 600 mm on the lower slopes of the Ethiopian Highlands.\\"Somali Acacia- Commiphora bushlands and thickets. World Wildlife Fund ecoregion profile. Accessed 22 September 2019. Rainfall can be erratic and vary widely from year to year. Flora The plant communities include woodlands, shrublands, grasslands, and thickets. The predominant trees are deciduous species of Acacia and Commiphora, with a low herbaceous understory.

This phase of engagement can be traced back to the late 1960s following an intense period of hostility caused by indirect confrontation between the two countries, particularly during the Korean War and the Vietnam War. With the US' support for Taiwan during the Taiwan Strait crises and its military expansion in the Pacific region, the relationship grew more antagonistic for the Chinese government perceive these initiatives to be US' attempt to encircle China. The domestic upheaval as a result of the Cultural Revolution in China and its commitment to communism through political radicalism accelerated the conflict. The four presidencies preceding the Bush administration were said to embrace a national policy direction toward strategic ambiguity, or deliberate ambiguity particularly in dealing with China. In October 2018, Vice President Mike Pence delivered a speech at the Hudson Institute on China, signifying the end of strategic engagement and officially proclaiming a new stage in the bilateral relationship, strategic competition.  Background  In 1949, the establishment of the People's Republic of China in the mainland after successfully revolting against the Nationalist government further severed its relationship with the US, who feared the balance of power would be threatened by the expansion of a powerful Soviet-led communist bloc. As leader of the People's Republic of China, in 1950 Mao Zedong paid an official visit to the Soviet Union, where the two communist states entered into agreement the Sino- Soviet Alliance Treaty. The Treaty formalized Kremlin's major commitment to secure the Asian theater from falling under the US' influence by its pledge to supply military equipment and provide financial loans to support China. Although Mao and Kim didn't share many strategic views at the time, with Soviet support China sided with North Korea and contributed its so-called \\"Chinese volunteers\\" to fight the war against South Korea, who was backed and defended mainly by the US. The US' support for the nationalist government across the strait was an important cause in perpetuating the irreconcilable distrust between the two countries. By recognizing the Chiang-led ROC as the legitimate government for the whole China, the US proclaimed its support to strengthening the security cooperation with Taipei by the singing of a mutual defense treaty in 1954. With President John F. Kennedy promising to protect Taiwan during the Taiwan Strait crises of 1955 and 1958 and his insistence on the \\"Two Chinas policy\\", any hope for rapprochement at this time was overshadowed by the Chinese immense perception of threat on its quest to reunification. Further worsening this hostility was the entry into force of a series of defense treaties between the US with Australia, New Zealand, and Japan (ANZUS) and the establishment of SEATO in 1954 as an alliance structure of regional security, which China believed to not only hedge against Soviet influence but also to contain Chinese development. US military engagement in the Pacific led to the forward deployment of its military troops around the region, such stationing activities greatly reinforced the idea of \\"containment\\" on the China side. With the outbreak of the Vietnam War in 1955, US gradually became more involved in the region by directly sending troops to Vietnam to make sure it would not fall under communist control. This ideology- driven calculation was substantiated by the \\"domino theory\\", leading to a proxy war fought between North Vietnam who wanted self-determination and a US- backed South Vietnam. Because Vietnam is located in such a geographically strategic area bordering China, the Vietnam War posed an imminent threat to its security. Along with the Soviet Union, China remained a major ally of North Vietnam by providing military training, human power and essential supplies to Viet Cong (the National Liberation Front). The escalation of conflict in Vietnam coincided with China's quickly degrading relationship with the Soviet Union and an increasingly chaotic domestic situation caused by the Cultural Revolution, all of which amplified the threat perception it had against the two biggest powers at this time.  Cold War Change of Atmosphere  = Detent√© = By the 1960s, the US had started to notice the tension in Sino-Soviet relation, and it sought to take advantage of this crack to contain the Soviet Union. With the Nixon administration attempting to facilitate a settlement to its quagmire in Vietnam, one of the symbolic acts signifying the beginning of Detent√©, this paved the way for successful rapprochement. In 1972, Nixon visited China where he gave a landmark speech, also known as the Shanghai Communiqu√©, on the importance of diplomatic normalization to both countries' interests. The Communiqu√© assured China that the US would now recognize only the mainland government as the legitimate authority of both states across the Taiwan Strait, and that the US won't challenge against One China Policy, a doctrine asserted by the PRC. In 1978 President Carter and the PRC agreed to the complete normalization of diplomatic relation, officially ending decades of hostility and confrontation between the two countries. With a change in the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party from Mao Zedong to Deng Xiaoping in 1978, China implemented a drastic number of market reforms and subsequently became more open to foreign businesses and investment. Referred to in the Carter administration as a political move of \\"playing the China card\\" to keep the Soviet Union in check, US' reversal of foreign policy direction regarding the Taiwan issue brought US diplomatic tie with the ROC to an end. However, with the entry into force of the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, the US continued its substantial but unofficial support to Taiwan to maintain security and strategic peace. The continuation of US arms sales to Taiwan was charged by the PRC as a breach from what their joint Communiqu√© issued in 1982 has stated, that the US \\"intends to gradually reduce its sale of arms to Taiwan\\". = Arm sales to China by the US = The Reagan administration reinforced US commitment to strengthen diplomatic relation with China by the passage of the Third Joint Communiqu√© in August 1982. With more public pressure to hedge against Soviet expansion, US government eventually allowed government-to-government military purchases to be made by the PRC under the authorization of Congress and the Foreign Military Sales Program. The two countries also embarked on cooperation in the field of nuclear energy, evident in the 1985 Agreement on Nuclear Cooperation, in which the US pledged to provide a legal framework to assist China in its peaceful nuclear development agenda with high technology transferred from US companies. By 1986, the military sale had surpassed US$37 million, approximately $20 million of which were commercial sales. US and China military relationship became more pronounced when US Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger described it in September 1983 as possessing \\"three pillars\\" of coordination including senior visits, exchanges and technological cooperation. By this stage there was less discussion on strategic engagement between China and the US. This was partly due to the increasing amount of positive diplomatic progress in Soviet-US relation being facilitated under the leadership of the General Secretary of the Soviet Union, Gorbachev. = Tiananmen Square = Human rights has long been a contentious issue with which the US has to come to terms regarding China. Under the pressure from Congress and the international society which condemned the massacre at Tiananmen Square, President Bush temporarily slowed down cooperation between two states while trying to maintain the substance of their diplomatic ties. US government suspended military exports and arms sales to China, imposed sanctions including cancellations of high-level visits by US senior officials to the mainland. China accused any external effort to intervene into its domestic affairs as an outright infringement on its national sovereignty, including the US'. Despite the level of international outrage pointed at the crackdown, maintaining ties with China remained important to US national interests. This was shown in the dispatch of National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger on a secret task to mend the relationship through diplomatic channels in July 1989, only several weeks after the brutal killings.  Post Cold-War Strategic Issues  = G. H. W. Bush administration =  Gulf Conflict  A major issue at the beginning of the decade was the occupation of Iraq in Kuwait. Although China agreed to the US-sponsored resolution in the UN Security Council demanding Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait, it was hesitant about agreeing to the use of force under the UNSC auspices to stop the annexation. China chose to abstain when a resolution on this matter was called to a vote on 20 November 1990 (Resolution 678). When a US-led coalition of 35 countries waged a war against Iraq in January - February 1991, this was an opportunity for China to witness the military and technological superiority of the US. China's military modernization was heavily shaped by this experience.  Kosovo Crisis  The issue raised for China at the time of the Gulf Conflict in 1990-1991 arose again in the Kosovo crisis. In 1998-1999, Slobodan Milosevic started an atrocious nationwide project of ethnic cleansing against the majority Kosovo Albanians and the insurgents who wanted to oppose the continuous suppression carried out in the country. China saw US initiative of moving forces into the region to stop Serbian aggression as an attempt to consolidate its hegemonic influence. But China was also concerned about how this move can possibly set a precedent that might be invoked later as a justification for the international community to interfere into matters of strategic importance to China such as Taiwan and Tibet. With those assessments in mind, along with Russia portraying the situation in Kosovo as being exclusively under the Yugoslavian government's national authority, the proposed UNSC resolution to use military force was vetoed. Unable to gain legitimacy for its conduct under UN authorization, the US turned to NATO to seek public support for intervention in Kosovo. The bombing campaign under NATO auspices, which began on 24 March 1999, commenced airstrikes against Serbian military targets in Yugoslavia. A specific crisis in Sino-US relations during this campaign arose after the accidental bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade on 7 May 1999 by US warplanes. = Clinton administration =  China's accession to WTO  China's accession to WTO was preceded by a series of lengthy negotiations and discussion on significant required adjustments in the Chinese economy, which was an imperative for membership to be admitted. After Congress granted China the most favored nation status in 1980, the level of traded goods and products between two countries intensified, signaling a new period of economic interdependence when the US went on to become China's third largest-trading partner in 1984. Nevertheless, public pressure from anti-Chinese lobby groups and activists during multiple US Congressional hearings made obtaining China's MFN status renewal increasingly difficult. In September 1999, Clinton and President Jiang Zemin agreed to resume negotiations on China WTO membership when progress was halted after the US accidentally bombed a Chinese embassy in Belgrade. With President Clinton's persuasive rhetoric on the US ability to gain leverage over not only a market-open, reform-committed but also potentially democratizable China whose economic dependence will allow greater room for the US to exercise influence, Congress passed legislation to grant China permanent trading privileges and historically put the two countries on equal footing as the latter became an official member of the WTO. During this period, the US purposely maintained a neutral attitude of \\"strategic ambiguity\\", not seeking to provoke China by promising to defend Taiwan but sending clear signals to express its interest in Taiwan's security. = G. W. Bush administration =  Departure from strategic ambiguity  Tension developed in this period for the assertive approach taken by China and an explicitly aggressive attitude adopted by the Bush administration in dealing with sensitive issues. The antagonism was heightened again when President Bush declared that the US would do \\"whatever it takes\\" to defend Taiwan, much to the resentment of China. However, the US also had to take care that Taiwan did not exploit this situation and precipitate a crisis to move toward asserting independence. Despite official attempts from the State Department to reconfirm that there had been no change in the US position, the general impression remained that there had been a somewhat departure from the policy of \\"strategic ambiguity\\".  War on terrorism  The relationship between the two powers was affected in various ways against the background of the September 11 attacks. With Bush's declaration of the war on terrorism, China indicated its fervent support. Despite the shock induced from this series of brutal terrorist attacks orchestrated by al-Qaeda, at the same time China saw this situation as providing opportunities for improving relations with the US. In the Middle East, China joined the US-led anti-terrorism campaign in Afghanistan against the Taliban, and tactically gained US trust as a regional intermediary in pressuring Pakistan for cooperation. In Asia, China put aside its historical resentment toward Japan's potential marine expansion in the region and agreed to Japanese vessels' operation in the Indian Ocean to support the war against Afghanistan. By giving its full support to US in the war against terrorism, China hoped to win US support in its campaign against Muslim separatists in Xinjiang who were now labelled \\"terrorists\\". The US was reluctant to support China's suppression efforts over separatist movements in Xinjiang, and the differences over Tibet and Taiwan seemed irreconcilable.  North Korean issue  In Northeast Asia developments relating to North Korea highlighted the importance of Sino-US cooperation. The Republican administration was critical of the 1994 Geneva Accord for giving too much energy and financial assistance to North Korea without there being any guarantee that it would not renege on its commitment. This led to North Korea reactivating one of its nuclear proliferation programs, and subsequently withdrawing from the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. US and China worked closely to constrain North Korea's nuclear capability, which was shown in their joint effort to formalize the Six Party Talks in 2003. While US needed China to apply pressure on Pyongyang, China remained skeptical of the degree of pragmatic actualization of a comprehensive and verifiable denuclearization goal set out by the former state. = Obama administration = President Obama visited China during his first year in office, making him the first US President to ever do so. Obama reshaped the direction of American foreign policy with his proclamation of \\"Pivot to Asia\\", and so engagement with China on all strategic fields of importance still remains a priority throughout his two terms. Generally focusing on peaceful cooperation with a clearly constrained reliance on military rhetoric, the relationship between two countries witnessed mostly positive development in Obama's first term, but gradually became characterized by more complex layers of dynamics and accompanied global-level threats during the final years of Obama's administration. Obama was a fervent supporter of facilitating dialogues and keeping negotiations alive when it comes to China. His participation in international intergovernmental economic organizations demonstrated a relentless attempt to integrate China into the already existing border- transcending institutional frameworks such as the G7 and G20, a practice held by his administration to work in favor of both the world and America. The two countries collaborated to impose sanctions on North Korea for its continued proliferation activities of nuclear weapons through the binding power given by the UNSC. Both states vowed to take an initiative in the fight against global warming and climate change by the signing of the Paris accords, which China has said it would protect even when Donald Trump decided to withdraw the US from the agreement. The Paris climate deal pledges to cut global greenhouse gas emission and transform the world into a low-carbon consuming business with big industrialized states like the US and China committing to modify national legislation to meet the preset objectives. During his first Asia trip in 2017 since leaving office, Obama was complimented by Xi Jinping for his devoted contributions in bettering Sino-US relation albeit the still on-going territorial disputes in the South China Sea and the high level of tension caused by a huge trade deficit in their trade relationship. = Trump administration = US China relationship has been characterized by a high level of friction within the first few years of the Trump administration. The massive over-time accumulation of US trade deficit against China has resulted in the media labeling their trade interaction the \\"trade war\\". Because China imports raw materials and petroleum from the community of developing countries in the Middle East and exports manufactured goods to the US, it has an asymmetrically large surplus with the latter. Leaders of the two countries have worsened the issue by imposing tariffs in a tit-for-tat chain of reactions which whipsaw American businesses with production facilities outsourced in China for cheap labor and easy access to the market. Much of the unsettled conflicts dealt with by previous administrations still account for a large part in the two countries' relationship. These problems have become much more complicated and encompass many different aspects including freedom of navigation in the South China Sea, tension over autonomous regions, global threats like climate change, cyber warfare, international terrorism, and possible covert interference into US elections, all of which require an efficient exercise of diplomacy and cooperation. The Trump administration has vastly changed the method by which the US has often used to pressure China on making economic concessions, which is the exercise of powerplay derived from multilateralism. The US pulled out its signature from the TPP, a regional trade pact in Asia Pacific committed to protect intellectual property rights, maintain labor standards, reinforce environmental regulations and reduce trade barriers between member states. Without a US-led economic arm that could help contain China's geopolitical influence, US withdrawal was perceived by many to further enhance China's domination in the region. On October 4 2018, Vice President Pence stated to the press that a new approach in dealing with China's excesses would be taken, officially ending the era of strategic engagement and transitioning into strategic competition.

The Payatas dumpsite is a former garbage dump in the barangay of the same name in Quezon City, Metro Manila, Philippines. History The Payatas dumpsite, established in the 1970s, used to be an open dumpsite in Lupang Pangako in Payatas, Quezon City. Prior to this, the area used to be a ravine that was surrounded by farming villages and rice paddies. People residing in the Smokey Mountain landfill in Tondo, Manila who often works as scavengers migrated to the Payatas dumpsite after the closure of the former in 1995 with the latter developing a reputation as the \\"Second Smokey Mountain\\", \\"21st Century Smokey Mountain\\", \\"Smokey Mountain Two\\", \\"New Smokey Mountain\\", \\"Smokey Valley\\" or the \\"Modern- day Smokey Mountain\\". On July 10, 2000, a landslide in the area caused the deaths of 232 people residing within the landfill, which prompted the passage of Republic Act No. 9003 or the Ecological Solid Waste Management Act of 2000, which mandates the closure of open dumpsites by 2004 and controlled dumpsites by 2006. The dumping ground was immediately closed following the incident by then-President Joseph Estrada but was reopened weeks later by then-Quezon City Mayor Ismael Mathay Jr. to avert an epidemic in the city due to uncollected garbage caused by the closure. In 2004, the landfill was reorganized as a controlled disposal facility but was closed in December 2010. A separate landfill with stricter waste management policy was established nearby the old open dumpsite in January 2011. Garbage in the dumpsite was dumped on a layer of tarpaulin to prevent seepage of leachate to the groundwater. The dumpsite closed in December 2017 following the Environmental Management Bureau order issued on August 2, 2017 so that it could review the environmental clearance certificate (ECC) of IPM Environmental Services, the operator of the dumpsite at that time.

Family and early history David Yencken was born in Berlin. His father was an Australian-born British Army officer and diplomat Arthur Ferdinand Yencken (1894‚Äì1944) and his mother was Mary Joyce Russell. They were married on 5 June 1925 at St. Margarets, Westminster.Arthur Ferdinand (1894‚Äì1944)) Womans World, 28 July 1925. Yencken marriage The family moved several times so that Yencken spent his early years between Berlin (1928‚Äì1931), Cairo (1932‚Äì1936), Rome, Madrid (1939‚Äì40), and then when the families of embassy staff were evacuated due to the Spanish Civil War, he lived in Australia from 1940 to 1942, then returned to Spain and then to school in England. His father died in an air crash in Spain in May 1944. David had an elder brother Dr. John Yencken (1926‚Äì2012) who was an Australian scientist. David attended school in England and Australia, and was awarded a Bachelor of Arts degree by the University of Cambridge majoring in History.Citation ‚Äì Professor David Yencken AO Professional career In his early 20s Yencken decided on a short visit to Australia, arriving in Sydney via Canada in 1954, and then drove to Melbourne in a borrowed car. He soon decided to stay, and his first business venture was Brummels Gallery in South Yarra, which focussed on contemporary Modernist Australian painting, sculpture and prints. \\"I opened the gallery in 1956 in partnership with Pat Collins, the owner of the coffee shop below the gallery. The gallery was devoted to Australian painting and at the time of its opening was one of only two with this focus in Melbourne. Although I didn't run the gallery for long, it was for me a significant experience‚Ä¶\\" The first gallery of this type, Australian Galleries in Collingwood, had opened just five months earlier. During his travels through Canada he was introduced to \\"several wonders of the new world: hamburgers, three-minute car washes and motels\\"; motels were something not seen in the UK or Australia in the mid 50s, and he decided to build one. Buying land on the highway at the edge of Bairnsdale, he opened one of the first motels in Australia (and the first in country Victoria), in 1957, the Mitchell Valley Motel, designed by architects Mockridge Stahle & Mitchell (demolished in 2008). The success of this venture led to him being approached to part own, develop and operate another in Merimbula, NSW, The Black Dolphin, which opened in 1961, and was designed by noted modernist architect and critic Robin Boyd. The project architect was a young Graeme Gunn, and the use of undressed tree-trunk posts, natural finishes, and native planting was an early example of the bush aesthetic in Australian architecture. After discussions with Robin Boyd, in 1965 Yencken co-founded Merchant Builders Pty Ltd., with architect Graeme Gunn, landscape designer Ellis Stones and timber merchant John Ridge. The philosophy of the company was to create homes emphasising the unique characteristics of the Australian landscape with a vision of creating architect-designed houses that were at project home prices. In 1969 the firm's first foray into larger concerns was the Elliston Estate in Rosanna, where a sense of flowing native landscape on an existing subdivision was created, and a range of house designs by four architects ‚Äì Charles Duncan, Daryl Jackson & Evan Walker, McGlashan Everist and Graeme Gunn. They then pioneered the concept of cluster housing, where groups of homes share a communal landscaped setting of dense native planting, firstly at Winter Park in Doncaster, built 1970-74, and Vermont Park in 1977, which included a clubhouse and swimming pool. Winter Park led the Victorian Government to introduce the Cluster Titles Act 1974, and in 1975 it received a citation in the Royal Australian Institute of Architect's Housing Awards. In 1968, Yencken commissioned Gunn to design a holiday house called Baronda, in what is now Nelson Lagoon Mimosa Rocks National Park in NSW, created in part by his gift of the property to the state in 1973. Merchant Builders won three Victorian Architectural Medals and several other architectural awards, including the inaugural Robin Boyd Environmental Award for changing the face of residential Melbourne in 1972. Yencken also founded the planning and landscape architect firm Tract Consultants, around the same time, holding positions of Chairman and Managing Director between 1971 and 79. Tract was often the landscape designer for homes built by for Merchant Builders, including Vermont Park. Public service Following a commitment generally to better preserve the environment by the Whitlam Labour Government in the early 1970s, a Committee of Inquiry into the National Estate (the 'Hope Inquiry') was established in 1973, with Yencken as one of 6 members, which produced the seminal Report on the National Estate in April 1974. The National Estate was broadly defined, evaluating equally the natural environment, Aboriginal places, and historical structures and landscapes. Yencken was then appointed Chairman of the Interim Committee on the National Estate, which led to the formation of the Australian Heritage Commission which he then chaired from 1975‚Äì1981, with their first meeting on 27 July 1976.Industrial Heritage and the National Estate, Sharon Sullivan, Executive Director, Australian Heritage Commission 1995 The main work of the Commission was the creation of the Register of the National Estate, a comprehensive overview of the Australian heritage places, which had more than 13,000 listings when it abolished by the Howard government in 2004. The Register was innovative for including sites of natural and historic value, as of equal importance as the built environment. In regard to architectural heritage, Yencken said that : \\"We collectively reached the view that the only way to avoid bias in listing caused by temporarily prevailing architectural likes and dislikes, was to seek to list the best examples of each style period.\\"Jewel Topsfield The man who helped re-imagine Melbourne Sydney Morning Herald July 6, 2019 He was appointed Secretary (Chief Executive) of the Ministry for Planning and Environment 1982‚Äì87, by the Minister for Planning Evan Walker in the new Cain Labor Government. During his time he oversaw a number of major initiatives including; a new Metropolitan Policy and State Conservation Strategy; a comprehensive plan for the redevelopment of the Melbourne CBD and Southbank; numerous legislative changes; and local planning initiatives. Professor Yencken oversaw the initial moves towards the rejuvenation of Southbank. At the time the precinct was made up of old factories and warehouses, and it was widely felt that the city had 'turned its back on the Yarra River'. A lot of our work in the initial instance focused on the central area of Melbourne because there was such a sense of neglect and lack of policy direction This lack of effective action was being expressed in papers like The Age on a very regular basis. We had a big program and that included Southbank. The first changes, the Southbank Promenade and the Evan Walker Footbridge, were completed after he left the Ministry. In 1988, he developed the concept of The Creative City, which has since become a global movement reflecting a new planning paradigm for cities. It was first described in his article 'The Creative City', published in the literary journal Meanjin. In this article Yencken argues that while cities must be efficient and fair, a creative city must also be one that is committed to fostering creativity among its citizens and to providing emotionally satisfying places and experiences for them. Yencken served as the inaugural Chairman of Australia ICOMOS in 1976, was joint leader of the Australian Delegation to the UNESCO World Heritage Committee in 1988 and 1981 and his other public roles included the Prime Minister's Urban Design Taskforce in 1994 and 1995, chair of the Design Committee of the Australia Council for the Arts, and President and later Patron of the Australian Conservation Foundation. Yenken held the Elisabeth Murdoch Chair of Landscape Architecture and Environmental Planning from 1988 to 1997, then was Professor of Landscape Architecture and Environmental Planning, and later Professor Emeritus all at the University of Melbourne. Writings and awards Yencken has written or edited seven books, essays, journal articles and conference proceedings. His publications include : *Report of the Interim Committee on the National Estate, May 1975 *Community aspirations and professional responsibility for historic conservation, Australian Heritage Commission, 1980. *'The Creative City', Meanjin, Volume 47 Issue 4 (Summer 1988) *Multifunction Polis: Social Issues Study, Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce, Canberra, 1989 *Restoring the Land: Environmental Values, Knowledge, and Action, David G.

The half-life of the system is 8.9 ¬± 0.1 million years. Today hafnium-182 is an extinct radionuclide, but the hafnium-tungsten radioactive system is useful in studies of the early Solar system since hafnium is lithophilic while tungsten is moderately siderophilic, which allows the system to be used to date the differentiation of a planet's core. It is also useful in determining the formation times of the parent bodies of iron meteorites. The use of the hafnium-tungsten system as a chronometer for the early Solar system was suggested in the 1980s but did not come into widespread use until the mid 1990s when the development of multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry enabled the use of samples with low concentrations of tungsten.  Basic principle  The radioactive system behind hafnium-tungsten dating is a two-stage decay as follows: : ‚Üí + + : ‚Üí + + The first decay has a half-life of 8.9 million years, while the second has a half-life of only 114 days, such that the intermediate nuclide tantalum-182 (182Ta) can effectively be ignored. Since hafnium-182 is an extinct radionuclide hafnium-tungsten chronometry is performed by examining the abundance of tungsten-182 relative to other stable isotopes of tungsten, of which there are effectively five in total, including the extremely long-lived isotope tungsten-180, which has a half-life much longer than the current age of the universe. The abundance of tungsten-182 can be influenced by processes other than the decay of hafnium-182, but the existence of a large number of stable isotopes is very helpful for disentangling variations in tungsten-182 due to a different cause. For example, while 182W, 183W, 184W and 186W are all produced by the r- and s-processes the rare isotope tungsten-180 is only produced by the p-process. Variations in tungsten isotopes caused by r- and s-process nucleosynthetic contributions also result in correlated changes in the ratios 182W/184W and 183W/184W, which means that the 183W/184W ratio can be used to quantify how much of the tungsten-182 variation is due to nucleosynthetic contributions. The influence of cosmic rays is more difficult to correct for since cosmic ray interactions affect the abundance of tungsten-182 much more than any of the other tungsten isotopes. Nonetheless cosmic ray effects can be corrected for by examining other isotope systems such as platinum, osmium or the stable isotopes of hafnium, or simply by taking samples from the interior that have not been exposed to cosmic rays, though the latter requires large samples. Tungsten isotopic data is usually plotted in terms of Œµ182W and Œµ183W, which represent deviations in the ratios 182W/184W and 183W/184W in parts per 10,000 relative to terrestrial standards. Since Earth is differentiated the crust and mantle of Earth are enriched in tungsten-182 relative to the initial composition of the Solar system. Undifferentiated chondritic meteorites have Œµ182W=-1.9¬±0.1 relative to Earth, which is extrapolated to give a value of -3.45¬±0.25 for the initial Œµ182W of the Solar system.  Dating planetary core formation  Illustration of how hafnium-tungsten dating can help quantify the time of differentiation (core formation) of a planetA primordial planet is undifferentiated, meaning that it is not layered according to density (with the densest material being towards the interior of the planet). When a planet undergoes differentiation the dense materials, particularly iron, separate from lighter components and sink to the interior forming the core of the planet. If this process took place relatively early in a planet's history, hafnium-182 would not have sufficient time to decay to tungsten-182. Since hafnium is a lithophile element the (undecayed) hafnium-182 would remain in the mantle (i.e. the outer layers of the planet). Then, after some time, the hafnium-182 would decay to tungsten-182 leaving an excess of tungsten-182 in the mantle. On the other hand, if differentiation occurred later in a planet's history, then most of the hafnium-182 would have decayed to tungsten-182 before differentiation began. Being moderately siderophilic, much of the tungsten-182 would sink towards the interior of the planet along with iron. In this scenario, not much tungsten-182 would subsequently be present in the outer layers of the planet. As such, by looking at how much tungsten-182 is present in the outer layers of a planet, relative to other isotopes of tungsten, the time of differentiation can be quantified. = Model ages = If we have a sample from the mantle (or core) of a body and want to calculate a core formation age from the tungsten-182 abundance we need to also know the composition of the bulk planet. Since we do not have samples from the core of Earth (or any other intact planet) the composition of chondritic meteorites is generally substituted for that of the bulk planet. Hafnium and tungsten are both refractory elements so there is not expected to be any fractionation between hafnium and tungsten due to heating of the planet during or after formation. A model age for the time of core formation can then be calculated using the equation t=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\lambda}\\\\ln \\\\left ( \\\\frac{(\\\\epsilon^{182}{\\\\rm W_{chondrite}}-\\\\epsilon^{182}{\\\\rm W_{SSI}})f^{\\\\rm Hf/W}}{\\\\epsilon^{182}{\\\\rm W_{sample}}-\\\\epsilon^{182}{\\\\rm W_{chondrite}}} \\\\right ), where \\\\lambda is the decay constant for hafnium-182 (0.078¬±0.002 Ma‚àí1), the Œµ182W values are those of the sample, chondritic meteorites (taken to represent the bulk planet) and the Solar System Initial value, and f^{Hf/W}accounts for any differences in the general abundance of hafnium between the sample and chondritic meteorites, f^{Hf/W}=\\\\frac{(^{180}{\\\\rm Hf}/^{184}{\\\\rm W})_{\\\\rm sample}}{(^{180}{\\\\rm Hf}/^{184}{\\\\rm W})_{\\\\rm chondrite}}-1. It is important to note that this equation assumes that core formation is instantaneous. This can be a reasonable assumption for small bodies, like iron meteorites, but is not true for large bodies like Earth whose accretion likely took many millions of years. Instead more complex models should be used that model core formation as a continuous process are more reasonable. = Core formation times for Solar system bodies = The method of hafnium-tungsten dating has been applied to many samples from Solar system bodies and used to provide estimates for the date of core formation. For iron meteorites hafnium-tungsten dating yields ages ranging from less than a million years after the formation of the first solids (calcium-aluminium-rich inclusions, usually called CAIs) to around 3 million years for different meteorite groups. While chondritic meteorites are not differentiated as a whole, hafnium-tungsten dating can still be useful for constraining formation ages by applying it to smaller melt regions in which metals and silicates have separated. For the very well studied carbonaceous chondrite Allende this gives a formation age of around 2.2 million years after the formation of CAIs. Martian meteorites have been examined and indicate that Mars may have been fully formed within 10 million years of the formation of CAIs, which has been used to suggest that Mars is a primordial planetary embryo. For Earth models of accretion and core formation are strongly dependent on how much giant impacts, like that presumed to have formed the Moon, re-mixed the core and mantle, yielding dates of between 30 and 100 million years after CAIs depending on assumptions.

R. Rahman composed the feature film soundtrack and background score. The lyrics for the songs has been penned by Madhan Karky, Na. Muthukumar in Tamil. Rahman was chosen to compose the songs, during the post-production works of the film in December 2015. The recording process for the songs and original score, took place for nearly four years. The soundtrack album was launched at a promotional event held on 27 October 2017, at Burj Al Arab, Dubai, where the film's cast and crew and other celebrities attended the event. Two songs from the movie was released in Tamil, and also the dubbed versions inTelugu and Hindi, on the same day and A bonus track was released on 6 November 2018, in Tamil as well as the dubbed versions in Telugu and Hindi. The album received generally positive reviews from critics. Development In 2015, during pre-production phase of the film, it was announced that A. R. Rahman would be composing the soundtrack and original score of 2.0. In an interview with Archana Chandhok on Zee Tamil, Rajinikanth revealed that director Shankar wanted to make 2.0 without any songs. Plans for recording a title track and a background song failed. The track \\"Enthira Logathu Sundariye\\" made its way after taking into account that the screenplay of the film was entirely subject-oriented and moves at a frenetic pace. Keeping audiences in consideration, a \\"breather\\" form of a song was recorded. However, Rahman was still not convinced and felt that an album should have a minimum of four songs to provide listeners with a wholesome experience. In an interview with Press Trust of India, Rahman stated that 2.0 was a tough film to score. Recording of \\"Endhira Logathu Sundariye\\" was completed by early August 2017. The song, reported as a romantic number with dance included, was shot indoors in a 12-day schedule in August 2017. Recording of the Hindi version (\\"Mechanical Sundariye\\") of the track was completed on 29 October 2017. The Hindi version of \\"Pullinangal\\" titled \\"Nanhi Si Jaan\\" was recorded in June 2018. About this, Rahman stated that he initially wanted to release more background themes rather than songs. Overview ;Endhira Logathu Sundariye Madhan Karky's lyrics in the duet Endhira Logathu Sundariye speak of a romance between a male and a female robot. \\"En uyire uyire batteriye, enai nee piriyaadhae\\" (My life, my life battery, do not leave me) or \\"Hey minsara samsarame\\" (My electronic wife) are in line with 2.0's storyline. Armaan Malik and Shashaa Tirupati have sung the Hindi version, while Sid Sriram and the latter have sung the Tamil and Telugu versions. The composition is not forgettable, but the trap music arrangement and the techno bleeps and bloops do come in way of the melody. There are subtle differences, lyrically, between the Tamil and the Hindi versions, that reveal how the makers perceive audiences in the South and the Hindi belt. If Endhira Logathu Sundariye has Sriram singing \\"Un bus-in conductor naan\\" (I am your bus conductor), in Mechanical Sundariye, written by Abbas Tyrewala, Malik sings \\"Hoon super conductor main\\" (I am a super conductor) ‚Äì the idea being that Tamil audiences will appreciate the reference to Rajinikanth's early days. ;Raajali Raajali is an anthem-like number that celebrates the triumph of good over evil, a typical sentiment in Rajinikanth movies. The song begins with a reference to science fiction author Issac Asimov (\\"Isaac Asimov peran daa\\" ‚Äì grandson of Issac Asimov) but it is merely casual name dropping, nothing clever. ;Pullinangal The best composition is Pullinangal, a sweet and sublime song that is an ode to birds. It is a theme song for the bird-loving villain, with the sweetness of the tune designed to draw him sympathy. Free from the mandate of having to be a theatre-shattering Rajinikanth song, the melodious Pullinangal's arrangement and mixing is low-key with strings, a simple synthetic beat, some piano and recordings of bird sounds. Though it is a love song that is ultimately not for a person, the singers (AR Ameen and Suzanne D‚ÄôMello sing all three versions, accompanied by Bamba Bakya in Tamil, Kailash Kher in Hindi, and fellow composer MM Keeravani in Telugu) sing their heart out, bringing an emotional weight missing from the other two tracks. Release A promotional music event for the film was held at Burj Al Arab, Dubai on 27 October 2017, with Rajinikanth, Akshay Kumar, Amy Jackson, composer A. R. Rahman, director Shankar, producer Subaskaran and the film's entire technical crew, along with Dhanush, Aishwarya R. Dhanush, Kamal Hassan and other celebrities attended the event. The event was hosted together by RJ Balaji, Rana Daggubati and Karan Johar. The album features two songs \\"Endhira Logathu Sundhariye\\" and \\"Rajaali\\". Both these tracks were released on digital music platforms the same day. A. R. Rahman and his music team performed these two songs and an additional track \\"Pullinangal\\" at the event. A symphony of an estimated 125 musicians was present to perform live. The audio launch event was telecasted on 19 November 2017 on Zee Tamil, and also telecasted once again on 2 December 2017 on News18 Tamil Nadu. The track \\"Pullinangal\\" was released as a part of the soundtrack album on 6 November 2018. Reception Behindwoods has gave 3.25/5 rating to the album & wrote A.R.Rahman churns out yet another powerful album that seems to be binding with the story whilst adding to its 2.0's grandeur. Srinivasa Ramanujam, from The Hindu, reviewed the soundtrack album, stating that \\"The focus of Rahman‚Äôs work in these two released songs for the Shankar-Rajinikanth film clearly seems to be on providing a futuristic soundscape rather than concentrating on tune ‚Äì perhaps aligning with the sci-fi elements in the script.\\" M Suganth, from The Times of India, reviewed the album, summarising it \\"As with Endhiran, Rahman has come up with songs that are global in sounding, but still distinctly local with 2.0.\\" A reviewer from Firstpost reviewed the song \\"Endhira Logathu Sundhariye\\", stating that \\"Shashaa Tirupati kickstarts the song on a mysterious note and in trademark Robot style. Then, we are transported into lots of techno, groovy beats and some subtle melody as well. And suddenly, it strikes you. What stands out in the midst of this typical AR Rahman-Rajini track is Sid Sriram's vocals. The singer is a breath of fresh air in this album which otherwise has nothing we have not already heard of, and also reviewing \\"Raajali\\" as \\"the track that uplifts the soul of the movie. It is evident, through the pace of the track, that it is tailor-made for Rajini's role. One can typically imagine the superstar in a larger than life setup with this one. We must say, Rajali' might just be the 'Irumbile Oru Idhaiyam' (Enthiran) of 2.0. Sid Sriram, who is the new Arijit Singh of the South industry, is definitely the highlight of this album yet again. The singer who otherwise was known for his addictive melodies like \\"Yennai Matrum Kadhale\\" and the latest hit \\"Maruvaarthai\\" has proved that he can be the voice behind such peppy and high techno songs too\\". Finally the reviewer gave a verdict, stating that \\"The 2.0 songs released so far are a feast for Rajini's audience. The tracks are tailor-made for a plot like 2.0's. But we sure have heard better from Rahman. And yet, the \\"Neruppu Da\\" feels from Rajini's last outing Kabali, is yet to be witnessed in this jukebox\\".  Track listing  Background score Recording of the original score began in London and Rahman's Los Angeles studios in 2016. Unlike previous projects, Rahman began finalizing the original background score six months back prior to release because he felt that the scenes were very heavy and it needed a lot of work. Official score from the film, composed by A.R. Rahman & Qutub-E-Kripa, was released on 29 June 2019. Album credits = Producer(s) = A. R. Rahman = Songwriter(s) = * A. R.

Kamauoha (1861 to March 26, 1886), born Joseph Aio Arthur Kamauoha was born in 1861 in NƒÅpo ªopo ªo, Kona, Hawai ªi. In 1883, the Hawaiian language newspaper Ke Koo o Hawaii, writes about three Keiki Hawaii Imi Na ªauao, three young men who travelled to London, England to study abroad. One of these your men was named Joseph A. Kaumauoha, a former student of  ªIolani School ªIolani School Admissions Archives and Punahou School during 1880-1882. Kamauoha, along with Matthew Makalua and Abraham Pi ªianai ªa traveled to England under the care of Manley Hopkins, HIs Majesty King KalƒÅkaua ªs Consul-General in England. His family genealogy traces back to the time of King Kamehameha I, where one of his k≈´puna (grandparent), Panila, was kahuna kƒÅlai wa ªa (canoe carver) to the Na ªi Aupuni (kingdom), essentially bringing his  ªohana closer to governmental power. Kamauoha was selected by His Majesty King KalƒÅkaua to be a scholar in the Hawaiian Kingdom sponsored Hawaiian Youths Abroad Program. Kamauoha attended King ªs College located in the heart of London near the River Thames. In his first year of school there he studied English, Latin, French, and Math. By the time his second year came around he was studying, Chemistry, Trigonometry and Mechanics. He was a serious student and quite shy as Manley Hopkins indicates in his letter to Hawaii, \\"Kamauoha is prudent, studios and diligent; gives no ground for complaint in anyway, but rather dull in conversation; indeed speaks but little.\\"Hawaii State Archives, Letter from Manley Hopkins to King David KalƒÅkaua. Kamauoha ªs quiet, humble demeanor was further highlighted in an editorial found in The Globe, a London based newspaper, entitled, \\"A Modest Rescuer.\\" In the editorial, Hopkins shares a story about a young Hawaiian man who rescues two men who fell off a plank while loading a ship. The Hawaiian man dragged the first man to the wharf and then proceeded to save the other man who fell after. After he saved the two men this Hawaiian man \\"immediately lost himself in the crowd\\" and \\"it was unknown to whom the two lives saved were indebted.\\" Manley Hopkins reveals that this Hawaiian man, who rescued these two men, was Joseph Kamauoha. The cold winters soon challenged his physical body that was made for a more tropical climate. In an update letter to His Majesty, dated October, 1885, Hopkins shares that Joseph was \\"suffering somewhat in health. I wrote that he had had a little trouble with one hand requiring slight operation and that a chill had occasioned an inflammation in his eye. Since then, he has had an attack of pleurisy, not severe, but not yet entirely removed.\\"13, Oct, 1885. Letter to His Majesty KalƒÅkaua from Manley Hopkins, Hawaiian Consulate London. It seemed that after his arrival, the winter started to take a toll on his body, so Hopkins moved Joseph Kamauoha to Torquay, England. Hopkins refers to this city as the \\"frying-pan of England\\" in his February 25, 1886 letter to His Majesty KalƒÅkaua. Being further away from his friends, humble and quiet Kamauoha made friends in Torquay. Sadly, in a letter dated March 27, 1886, Hopkins, announces the death of Joseph A. Kamauoha the day before in Torquay. He says, \\"Very kind friends in the boarding house at Torquay attended his bed- side, and he had every comfort. Thus we lose a fine, promising young man of high moral character.\\"1886, March 27. Letter to His Majesty KalƒÅkaua from Manley Hopkins, Hawaiian Consulate London. I ªm sure that this was a great loss to his two friends Makalua and Pi ªianai ªa, yet it was even greater loss for all of Hawaii who considered him ka imi na ªauao (the seeker of wisdom).

The South Bend Tribune's political writer at the time, James Carroll, described the primary the two men waged as being, \\"one of the meanest in Democratic history\\". Krueper prevailed in the primary, but the ugliness of the primary had split the party. =Republican primary= City Judge Lloyd M.

General election While a Democratic city, at the time, South Bend was more competitive in its mayoral elections than it is today. A Republican had last won a mayoral election in 1951, and one had come close in the narrow 1955 election (losing a close race to Edward F. Voorde). The election took place in the direct aftermath of the announcement that Studebaker, a major South Bend employer, would be closing its operations in the city. Allen won a landslide victory.

His favorite subjects were his wife, Lydia, and their children.  Biography  He came from a large working-class family and began his career as an apprentice stonemason in Krefeld, then spent three semesters at the Kunstgewerbeschule there. Then, in 1919, he enrolled in the preparatory courses at the Staatliche Bauhaus in Weimar, where he studied with Johannes Itten andi Lyonel Feininger. In 1920, he went to the pottery workshop at the Bauhaus in Dornburg. His primary instructors there were Gerhard Marcks and Max Krehan. The following year, he married Lydia Foucar (1895-1980), a prospective student whom he had met in Munich the year before.Magdalena Droste: √úberleben mit Formgeb√§ck, bei Klassik Stiftung Weimar, 26. September 2017Lydia Driesch- Foucar, bei: Friedrichsdorf, Website They had four children together, which brought their studies to an early finish, as they had to establish a family business to provide income. In 1922, he gave up pottery and became a free- lance artist, with the support of Marcks and the art historian, . He then continued his studies by himself, copying the Old Masters. After a futile attempt to obtain a Professorship in D√ºsseldorf, he and his family relocated to Frankfurt am Main in 1928 and opened a studio there. He died two years later, following a brief illness, while working on a commission in Erfurt. Most of his works were confiscated by the Nazi government in 1935, after they were classified as \\"degenerate art\\".

He has studied how firms manage the risks that they face in global markets, and how to price the institutional (cultural, political, and economic) risks that firms face in the markets they operate. In 2016, he wrote his second book entitled Global Vision: How Companies Can Overcome the Pitfalls of Globalization. = Global Vision = Salomon's book, Global Vision, examines the cultural, political and economic risks associated with globalization; and how to deal with those challenges while expanding globally.

The soundtrack consists of six feature songs along with instrumental tracks. The film's director Menon composed a song that Rahman curated.

As the film was \\"music-based\\", Menon required the songs to be completed before production began and by November 2016, Rahman had finished composing nine songs for that film and composed parts of the background score. The lyrics were written by Madhan Karky, Arunraja Kamaraj and the late Na. Muthukumar, who worked in the film before his death in August 2016.  Track listing  The official track list of songs was released long before the audio release by A. R.

Democrats nominated Eugene Pajakowki, who had unsuccessfully sought their nomination four years earlier. Two independent candidates were also running. General election Allen was endorsed by The South Bend Reformer newspaper. Allen won a strong reelection, winning by a 10,000 vote margin. Allen received strong support from the city's African American wards. Allen even received a surprising number of votes in the heavily-Democratic 2nd and 6th wards. Allen's victory had an arguable coattail effect, with Republican City Clerk nominee Cecil Blough winning his race.

The plot follows pastor Doug Jones who becomes infected by an artifact, resulting in him turning into a velociraptor when he becomes angry. Steere first thought of the idea in 2010. After screening at the B-Movie, Underground, and Trash (BUT) Film Festival on August 31, 2018, the film was released in the United States on August 13, 2019 by Wild Eye Releasing. Plot Doug Jones, is a priest, who witnesses his parents die in a car fire. After the incident, he travels to China on a spiritual journey and comes across ninjas after an artifact said to turn people into the Dragon Warrior. After becoming infected by the artifact, Doug begins having nightmares and goes out into the forest late at night as he transforms into a dinosaur. He saves Carol, a hooker, from a thug. Doug wakes up in Carol's bed naked believing they had sex together as Doug has no memory of last night. After Carol tells him what happened the night before, Doug eventually comes to realization. Carol then tries to convince Doug to use his new power to fight crime and get rid of people they believe are beyond saving in the name of the church, but is unsuccessful. Doug returns to the church for confessions and ends up speaking to Frankie Mermaid, Carol's pimp. Through their conversation Doug learns Frankie Mermaid is the one responsible for killing Doug's parents. Now enraged, Doug proceeds to kill Frankie Mermaid. Doug, now convinced to fight crime, returns to Carol in need of her assistance to carry out their plan in taking out criminals. Father Stewart learns of Doug's new power and confronts him, trying to encourage Doug to get rid of it and stop killing. Stewart takes Doug to see Altair, an exorcist, in hopes of performing an exorcism to remove Doug's power. In a flashback, we learn of Father Stewart's time during the war, as his war buddy Ali is shot while off guard and his love interest Adeline is killed in a tragic accident, running over a landmine. Back to the present, Altair fails the exorcism and Doug transforms, taking one of Father Stewart's eyes. Doug runs back to Carol but is first confronted by ninjas. Father Stewart wakes up in a camp of drug dealing christian ninjas, lead by Wei Chan. Wei Chan explains his plan to sell highly addictive cocaine to people and then cut off supplies, hoping this will lead those people to turn to the church where he will eventually take over and lead them for his army. Father Stewart rejects this idea and is then killed. Doug and Carol are later confronted by ninjas and plan to stop Wei Chan. Doug is stopped by Sam the White Ninja who Doug later realizes is also his brother. Doug catches Sam the White Ninja off guard and uses some form of telekinesis to take Sam's sword and kill him. Doug and Carol fight off more ninjas, during this exchange both Sam and Carol are badly wounded. Doug transforms and fights off the remaining ninjas before being shot with an arrow by Wei Chan, containing anti- venom to stop Doug's transformation. Doug's hands are immune to the anti-venom as he proceeds to kill Wei Chan. Doug carries Carol to the hospital where she recovers and is now fine. Doug is no longer a priest now with a bounty. He and Carol plan on traveling the world continuing their original idea of killing off criminals. Cast Production The director thought of the idea in 2010 while he was attending the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan, after his phone autocorrected \\"Velociraptor\\" to \\"Veloci Pastor\\". As a class project, Steere made a short film of fake grindhouse trailers which included The VelociPastor. His prior YouTube videos had around 45 views each, but his class project received around 45,000 views, resulting in him thinking that it might be a good idea for a film. Steere stated, \\"The movie is made to be fun, and anybody looking for deeper meaning in the man-turns-into-a-dinosaur genre is probably on a fool's errand.\\" From 2011 to 2016, there were two attempts to crowdfund the film, first through Kickstarter and then through Seed&Spark;, but neither attempt succeeded. The film received funding from a private investor that the mother of Steere's friend knew. The VelociPastor was filmed with $35,000. Steere was influenced by director Guillermo del Toro. Release The film premiered in Portland, Oregon, in the spring of 2017. After being shown in film festivals, the crew signed a deal with Wild Eye Releasing in 2018 and a trailer was shown later. Wild Eye Releasing released the trailer without informing Steere. The film was released on DVD and streaming in North America on August 13, 2019. Reception On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 54% based reviews from 13 critics, with an average rating of 5.5/10, Alex McLevy, writing for The A.V. Club, said, \\"This movie is going to endure. It's got a killer hook, is fun to watch, and doesn't overstay its welcome. It has 'cult classic' written all over it.\\" Michael Walsh of Nerdist said, \\"Is the movie good enough to be considered a truly great comedy? No, probably not. but it's still way better than most people would expect.\\" Amanda Sink from The Hollywood Outsider said \\"Albeit no cinematic achievement, The VelociPastor is a hysterically ludicrous horror- comedy that knows its absurdity and has no qualms inviting you in.\\" Jeffrey Lyles on Lyles' Movie Files reports \\"It's either the most absurd and ridiculous premise for a movie or the movie you've been waiting all of 2019 to see.\\" Bobby LePire, for Film Threat writes \\"Brendan Steere, his delightful cast, and committed crew have crafted a bonkers film that never stops entertaining.\\"  Sequel  Brendan Steere wants to do a sequel to the movie as he believes the world of VelociPastor is \\"so permissible and fun\\". Brendan Steere shared a sneak peek at the script over on Twitter, first making the announcing that a sequel script has officially been written and is set to start filming at some point.

It is intended to be used experimentally, to help evaluate the performance of post quantum key-exchange algorithms on actual users' devices. Details Similarly to its predecessor CECPQ1, CECPQ2 aims to provide confidentiality against an attacker with a large scale quantum computer. It is essentially a plugin for the TLS key-agreement part. CECPQ2 combines two key exchange mechanisms: the classical X25519 and HRSS (H√ºlsing, Rijneveld, Schanck, and Schwabe) scheme (an instantiation of the NTRU lattice based key exchange primitive). A slight modification of the algorithm, titled CECPQ2b, uses supersingular isogeny key exchange (SIKE) instead of HRSS. CECPQ2 uses 32 bytes of shared secret material derived from the classical X25519 mechanism, and 32 bytes of shared secret material derived from the quantum-secure HRSS mechanism. The resulting bytes are concatenated and used as secret key. Concatenation is meant to assure that the protocol provides at least the same security level as widely used X25519, should HRSS be found insecure. The algorithm was to be deployed on both the server side using Cloudflare's infrastructure, and the client side using Google Chrome Canary. Since both parties need to support the algorithm for it to be chosen, this experiment is available only to Chrome Canary users accessing websites hosted by Cloudflare. It was estimated that the experiment started mid-2019. It was considered a step in a general program at Cloudflare to transition to post-quantum safe cryptographic primitives.

Established in 1982, it is third of nine estate neighborhoods developed in The Woodlands. Its namesake is the Grogan-Cochran Lumber Company, the last sawmill to operate in the area. It is characterized by large residences on large land lots. It consists of 800 acres, 465 estates, 3 parks, and 2 ponds. It borders the 13th hole of The Oaks Golf Course of The Woodlands Resort, which is ranked by Golf Digest as one of the best golf resorts in North America. Grogan's Point is known for the six historic-inspired estates built by the Westbrook Building Company. It was a prominent neighborhood for many Enron executives and remains closely linked to the energy industry due to the proximity of ExxonMobil's main campus.  History  Grogan's Point was initially envisioned as an equestrian community, emphasizing George Mitchell's founding vision of The Woodlands staying close to nature. As development of the Grogan's Mill Village began in 1972, it was stalled by the 1970s energy crisis, which significantly affected Greater Houston due to its standing as the \\"Energy capital of the world.\\" To attract buyers from River Oaks and Memorial, the plan was changed to build an estate neighborhood characterized by large residences on large land lots. Development was led by Wally and Leo Westbrook of the Westbrook Building Company, who constructed the first 80 estates. Grogan's Point success became the model for estate neighborhoods future villages would follow, including West Isle (1988), Windward Cove (1990), The Cove (1991), Carlton Woods (1998), Carlton Woods Creekside (2007), and East Shore (2008). Development of Grogan's Point commenced in three main phases: * Phase 1 (1982-1990), Grogans Point Rd, Watertree, Longspur, Southgate * Phase 2 (1993-1999), Red Sable, Northgate, N. Tranquil Path, Hillock Woods * Phase 3 (2004-2011), S. Tranquil Path, Starlight, Angel Leaf = Flooding = Grogan's Point is encircled by Spring Creek and Panther Creek and has been increasingly challenged by flooding potentially due to climate change. Following the flooding of Hurricane Harvey, Texas Governor Greg Abbott directed the San Jacinto River Authority in April 2018 to \\"find ways to mitigate flooding\\" in neighborhoods such as Grogan's Point. In October 2018, The Woodlands Water Agency proposed a project \\"to enlarge four box culverts,\\" for Grogan's Point. As of July 2019, mitigation efforts are still underway.

The Woodlands is not a city nor a traditional township government, however it still provides limited municipal government services such as trash pickup, parks and recreation, covenant enforcement, fire and rescue services, streetscaping, economic development, and enhanced law enforcement and security patrols. Membership in the Grogan's Point Residents' Association is voluntary for residents. Affiliate membership is available for former residents. It is governed by bylaws.

These protests followed the sustained street protests and civil disobedience of the Sudanese Revolution and the early September 2019 transfer of executive power to the Sovereignty Council of Sudan, civilian prime minister Abdalla Hamdok and his cabinet of ministers. Hamdok described the 39-month transitional period as being defined by the aims of the revolution. Background Eight months of street protests and sustained civil disobedience in Sudan, starting on 19 December 2018, led to a Political Agreement and Draft Constitutional Declaration defining a 39-month political transition period that started in September 2019, formally transferring executive power to the Sovereignty Council of Sudan, civilian prime minister Abdalla Hamdok and his cabinet of ministers. Gilbert Achcar described the transition period as the fourth phase of the revolution. September 2019 On 12 September two thousand protestors in Khartoum and other cities and on 19 September twenty thousand protestors in Khartoum, Wad Madani and Port Sudan called for Abdelgadir Mohamed Ahmed to be appointed as Chief Justice and Mohamed el-Hafiz as Attorney-General, for the Khartoum massacre investigation commission to be created, and for the senior members of the previous government to be either tried in Sudanese courts on extradited to the International Criminal Court investigation in Darfur. Displaced people held mass protests in Mershing in South Darfur on 15‚Äì16 September 2019 and in Nyala on 17 September after armed men wearing Rapid Support Forces (RSF) uniforms shot dead University of Zalingei student Munir Hamid as well as Adam Mohamed, Hashim Karameldin and Radwan Abdelrahman. The protestors considered the transitional government to be responsible for the deaths and called for \\"the militias\\" to be disarmed. On 17 September, residents of Simit and other villages in Northern state protested against the construction of a new mine by Hamid Mining Company on the grounds of the risks of pollution from mercury and cyanide used during the extraction procedures. On the same day, people from South Kordofan protested in Khartoum to call for mining to be suspended, as ordered by the governor of South Kordofan but disobeyed by some mining companies. The protestors showed photographs of victims of the cyanide used in the mining process and called for local companies including El Sunut, al- Junaid (also Juneid), Abarsi and international mining companies to stop mining. On 18 and 19 September, the Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA), the Sudanese resistance committees, government employees and other el-Gadarif residents organised protests in el-Gadarif calling for the removal of the state governor on the grounds of government-controlled radio and television not reporting on activities of the Forces of Freedom and Change (FFC) and the situation of people affected by flooding, and against the governor's \\"anti- revolutionary position\\". On the same two days, the SPA protested in front of courts in Geneina against the trials of eight SPA coordinators, which they considered to be show trials punishing the SPA members for having organised protests and a strike. Teachers and other public servants in Red Sea protested on 18 September calling for senior officials associated with the previous government to be dismissed. Engineers and other workers of the White Nile Sugar Workers Union in White Nile protested on 17 September calling for officials of the previous government to be dismissed. Employers of the protestors dismissed three of the engineers and started investigations into others, which the protestors' committee, the Temporal Committee for the Restoration of the White Nile Sugar Workers Union, considered to be retaliation for having participated in the protest. On 22 September, Sudanese police used tear gas against students protesting in Nyala in South Darfur against bread shortages and transport failures and calling for the state governor to be dismissed. The FFC condemned the \\"use of tear gas and live bullets against peaceful protestors\\", called for civilian governors to be appointed, and called for an immediate investigation into the actions of the police. On 26 September, two thousand people protested in support of Waleed Abdelrahman Hassan (or Walid, Abdulrahman), a Sudanese student arrested in Cairo for alleged participation in the 21 September street protests in Egypt. The solidarity protest took place in Khartoum in front of the Foreign Affairs Ministry and the Egyptian Embassy. The SPA called for Abdelrahman Hassan to be able to contact his family, choose a lawyer and not be tortured or coerced. Abdelrahman Hassan's friends and relatives stated that an apparent confession by him broadcast by MBC Masr on 26 September, in which he stated support for the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, was a forced confession, given Abdelrahman Hassan's long-term opposition to Islamists in Sudan under the Omar al-Bashir government, for which he was arrested in 2013 and 2018, and during the Sudanese Revolution. Abdelrahman Hassan's friend Mohammed Saleh described the idea of Hassan supporting the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood as \\"unbelievable\\". The SPA stated that the video broadcast was \\"shameful\\" and that, \\"We stress here that the era when Sudanese citizens were humiliated inside or outside their country has gone and will never return.\\" Abedelrahman Hassan was freed on 2 October. October 2019 On 13 October protestors in el-Hilaliya in Gezira started a sit-in calling for the administrative head of el-Hilaliya to be dismissed, for the security committee to be dissolved, and for improvements to be made in education, health care, electricity and the environment. The administrative head was dismissed on 19 October. The week-long sit-in continued on 20 October, with protestors considering a shift of the protest to the state capital Wad Madani if their demands were not met. On 18 October, further protests against the use of cyanide and other toxic molecules in gold mining took place in Talodi. The protestors called for the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) to stop guarding the mining plants, for the Amir of Talodi to be dismissed, and for improved Talodi Hospital services. The RSF beat protest supporter Hussein Noureljalil in the head with their rifle butts. Regular army forces rescued Noureljalil and took him to Talodi Hospital. On 21 October 20 thousand people protested in Freedom Square in Khartoum and in other towns in Sudan calling for the National Congress Party (NCP), which dominated politics during the al-Bashir government, to be dissolved, and for its senior members to be tried in court. There were no reports of casualties. Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok gave a speech marking the 55th anniversary of the 1964 uprising, in which he said \\"the revolution needs greater efforts to be completed and achieve its goals\\", after firing several top bureaucrats associated with al-Bashir's government the previous week. The 21 October protestors also called for the investigation into the 3 June Khartoum massacre to be carried out transparently and into all suspects, including members of the civilian‚Äìmilitary Sovereignty Council who were formerly members of the Transitional Military Council. November 2019 On 11 November, Suakin residents blocked the main road linking Port Sudan to Tokar in protest against a week of electricity shtudowns. On the same day in Abu Naama in Sennar, protestors burnt the offices, fuel depots, tractors and factories of the Kanaf Abu Naama project in protest against carcinogens. Security services detained two residents. Students at Nyala University protested in front of local administrative offices on 11 November in protest against the lack of public transport, and called for university staff vehicles to be used to help transport students. On the same day in Abu Ushar in Gezira, protestors burnt tyres and blocked a major highway in protest against the lack of flour and the deterioration of other services. Also on 11 November, Jaafar Mohamedein of the Kanabi Congress, representing Kanabi, seasonal workers originally from Darfur and other western parts of Sudan recruited and settled in Gezira, protested about racism by government and the local population at a meeting in Khartoum on 11 November with Mohamed Mahala, representing Sovereignty Council member Mohammed al-Ta'ishi, and Sudan Liberation Movement/Army-Minni Minnawi members. Mohamedein called for the rights of the Kanabi to participate in the political process and for the creation of a Sovereignty Council commission to defend Kanabi rights. December 2019 On 11 December, people in Tawila in North Darfur protested against armed attacks by camel and cattle herders against farmers and people living in camps for those displaced by the War in Darfur. On 13 December 200 people protested in West Darfur against corruption, called for the state governor to be dismissed, and against the lack of bread and fuel. On 17 December, students at the University of Ed Daein in East Darfur protested against the drowning of a student in a ground water tank, accusing the Student Support and Welfare Fund of the al-Bashir epoch of negligence. Farmers in North Darfur blocked roads in protest against the theft and destruction of the crops by \\"outlaws\\". January 2020 Two thousand women demonstrated in Khartoum on 2 January 2020. They marched to prime minister Hamdok's office and submitted a petition signed by 46 citizens' groups and 13 political parties called for Sudan to ratify the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. The women complained that a list of nominees for state governors is a men-only list and called for laws against female genital mutilation and child marriage. On 15 January, ex-security agents from Sudan's former intelligence service, National Intelligence and Security Service, mutinied, engaging in a violent conflict with forces from their former employer, renamed the General Intelligence Service, in Khartoum. According to Al Jazeera, the conflict resulted in the death of 2 soldiers, leaving 4 wounded. Sovereignty Council member Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo attributed responsibility to former intelligence chief general Salah Gosh. Gosh was alleged to have escaped to Egypt after Bashir's government was overthrown by Sudan's regular armed forces. Egyptian authorities did not confirm Gosh's location. On 27 January, Ethiopian refugees rallied in front of the UN Refugee Agency buildings in Khartoum, complaining that they have their rights as refugees were not recognised, preventing them for either acquiring a nationality by naturalisation or byresettlement. On 28 January, twenty Sudanese protested in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Khartoum, calling for the return of relatives deployed against their wills to Libya and Yemen as mercenaries in the Second Libyan Civil War and the Yemeni Civil War. According to the demonstrators, their relatives had been deceived by an Emirati company, Black Shield, which had led them to believe that they were to be employed as security guards in the UAE. The families of the victims also protested outside the Emirati embassy in Khartoum on the same day. About 50 young men returned to Libya the same day, following the protests outside the UAE embassy. On 31 January, a day after the Sudanese Finance Minister Ibrahim al-Badawi announced a plan to gradually cut fuel subsidies over 18 months, the Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA) called for a \\"million man march\\" in Khartoum, which they described as an \\"expression of national unity\\" in protest against government policies. February 2020 Several Sudanese demonstrated outside the government headquarters in Khartoum on 4 February in protest against the 3 February secret meeting between the Chairman of the Sovereignty Council and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Israel stated that Sudan and Israel had agreed at the meeting to normalise relations. The two- hour meeting was held in Entebbe, Uganda. The Sudanese government claimed that it had not been notified of the plan to hold the meeting. Politician and religious figure Abdullahi Yousif claimed that Burhan did not have permission to meet with the Israeli prime minister without authorisation from other government members, and described the meeting as a betrayal for Allah. High- ranking military officers met at army headquarters in Khartoum and expressed support for the Burhan‚ÄìNetanyahu meeting. Al-Burhan stated that his meeting with Netanyahu had been intended to \\"protect national security\\". The Sovereignty Council stated that the Sudanese position in relation to Palestine and in support of the rights of Palestinians had not changed. Al-Burhan also stated that relations between Sudan and Israel remained \\"the responsibility of the designated institutions, in accordance with the Constitutional Document\\". On 12 February, Human Rights Watch stated that former President of Sudan Omar al-Bashir is set to finally answer for his crimes in Darfur, as the Sudanese leaders plan on collaborating with the International Criminal Court. However, the backing of Sudan's military in the handing over of the former president to the ICC, lies with great uncertainty. The decision was reached, when rebel groups and the transitional authorities of Sudan held peace talks in the capital of South Sudan in Juba on Tuesday, according to Al Jazeera. The BBC added that three more people are expected to be handed over to the ICC alongside Omar al-Bashir. Also, a senior official of the Sudanese government disclosed that they are figuring out a way that al-Bashir and the three others can be presented to the ICC without being extradited to the Hague. The Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA), called for a protest against the government on 20 February, following the dismissal of officers who actively aided the revolution that led to the removal of Omar al-Bashir last year in April. As the protesters gathered in hundreds to demand for the reinstatement of officers and soldiers who were dismissed last week, security forces fired tear gas in an attempt to disperse the crowd. At least 17 people were reported to have been injured in the crackdown, according to Reuters. All the victims who were wounded have been urged by the Sudanese Doctors Central Committee to visit the Federal Hospital in order to receive appropriate treatment. However, in Abu Jubeiha in South Kordofan, hundreds of protesters rallied through the streets on 24 February, to protest against the state government's decision to permit the resumption of mining activities by two companies in the town which has left the area highly polluted. The European Union on 29 February, pledged its support for the transitional government of Sudan with ‚Ç¨100 million, considering the deteriorating economic situation of the country. The EU representative also added that they are completely willing and ready to ensure smooth political transition in Sudan, with every means they have available. Joseph Borrell Fontells, the EU representative, is also expected to visit North Darfur after his two-day visit in Khartoum, according to Darfur24. March 2020 On 1 March, over 100 diplomats including ambassadors and administrators, linked with the former leader of Sudan Omar Al Bashir, were sacked by the Empowerment Removal Committee of Sudan. The deputy head of the committee disclosed that 109 ambassadors, diplomats and administrators were sacked from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, alongside those who were hired via political and social support. It was also reported that last month, assets of the former ruling party were confiscated by the committee, according to Reuters. The committee was created in November last year in accordance with a law, purposely for taking apart the government established by Al Bashir. On 5 March, the Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) organisation, disclosed the results of an investigation into the use of violence by armed security forces against pro-democracy protesters in Khartoum sit-in June 2019, which showed that up to 240 people were killed and more than a hundred others wounded. According to the rights group, the report was founded based on statements of several eyewitnesses, interviews with health practitioners, as well thousands of online video footage and pictures of the attacks. However, doctors associated with the protest movement claimed that at least 128 people were killed, while the authorities argued that the number was 87 and also falsified the allegations that they had given the go-ahead for the deadly 3 June attack. The PHR in the report, further accused the security forces of Sudan for carrying out excessive use of force against pro-democracy protesters. They have also urged member states of the UN to ensure that the perpetrators have been held accountable for their injustice. On 9 March, an investigation by Amnesty International, based on fresh evidence, exposed the involvement of all branches of Sudan's security forces in the violence carried out against protesters in 2018 and 2019, which showed how protesters were killed. The group has called on the authorities in Sudan to bring all those responsible for the death of protesters to justice through a just trial, that does not result in punishment by death. June 2020 On 3 June, several Sudanese protesters gathered in the streets of Khartoum, to seek out justice for the dozens of protesters that were killed in the 3 June 2019 crackdown. The protesters held up signs, images of members of the Rapid Support forces that they held responsible for the killings and burnt tires as they rallied through the streets. They also shut down roads in the capital Khartoum, as protests reportedly took place in other towns and cities across the country as well. However, Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok, while marking the anniversary of the horrific event in a televised statement, assured the Sudanese that the perpetrators of the crackdown will be brought to justice. On 9 June, The bank account of former leader Omar al-Bashir was seized, a Sudanese anti-corruption committee disclosed on Tuesday. In addition, five foreign exchange bureaus which were used to facilitate his administration were also closed. According to the committee, monthly transactions of millions of U.S. dollars were believed to have been carried out through the bank account which was confiscated. The amount received through Omar's personal bank account monthly had reached $20 million, Dabanga TV added. On 10 June, hundreds of Sudanese protested in Khartoum, against the formation of a United Nations Integrated Transition Assistance Mission in Sudan (UNITAMS), which was created to assist the political transition in the country. Several protesters waved the Sudanese flag, including banners indicating their objection to the foreign domination of Sudan, Anadolu Agency reported. In an attempt to break up the crowd which gathered near the army headquarters, security forces reportedly fired tear gas at the protesters. On 29 June, protesters in Nierteti in Central Darfur took to the streets in thousands, calling on security forces to put a stop to the deadly attacks carried out by gunmen on a daily basis in the area. The protesters further demanded increased protection, punishment to the gunmen responsible for the attacks, as well as ensuring they have laid down arms. A day before the sit-in started, unknown gunmen reportedly killed a woman and a soldier of the Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) near a camp in Nierteti. On 30 June, thousands of Sudanese protesters gathered in the streets of Khartoum, Omdurman, as well as Khartoum North, calling for rapid reform and larger civilian leadership in the country. Several demonstrators expressed their backing of Abdalla Hamdok's cause, while urging his government to ensure their demands have been met. During the massive peaceful rally, one person was reportedly killed, with many others wounded. The reported casualty was believed to have died as a result of a bullet to the chest, with 44 others also wounded by either bullets or tear gas, the Sudan Doctors Central Committee disclosed. Similar protests were also held in eastern Sudan's Kassala, and across the country, with some protesters shutting down roads, burning tires and chanting slogans of the anti-Bashir movement. July 2020 On 3 July, protesters in Nertiti in Central Darfur returned to the sit-in outside a government office for the fourth consecutive day, threatening to continue with the demonstrations until their calls were answered, according to the Urdu Point. Following the protests, Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok stated on Friday, that a delegation would be sent by the government to the area, in order to meet their demands. According to Dabanga, the protesters had already rejected a delegation from the security committee of Central Darfur, who visited the state capital Zalingei on Thursday. The protesters believe that filing several complaints regarding the insecurity in the area, the state officials haven't put in enough efforts to bring an end to the attacks. On 5 July, the transition government of Sudan disclosed that the Chief of Police, as well as his deputy were dismissed, as the Sudanese protesters continue to demand for justice against officials associated with the former government of Omar al-Bashir, according to Reuters. Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok stated on his Twitter account that Ezz Eldin Sheikh Ali had replaced the director- general of the Sudan‚Äôs Police Force, Adel Mohamed Bashaer. The Sudanese parliament however, did not provide any reason that led to the dismissal of the top officials. According to Reuters, both police officials who were dismissed are accused by several pro-democracy groups and protesters of having ties with the government of ousted ruler President Omar al-Bashir. On 13 July, during a peaceful protest in the Fataborno village of Sudan‚Äôs Northern Darfur where several people gathered to demand for better security in the area, armed men reportedly opened fire at them killing at least 10 people and 17 others injured, according to VOA News. Separately, a police station and cars were said to have been set ablaze by an unknown group of protesters in Kutum town in North Darfur state. On Sunday, demonstrators called for the establishment of a civilian government and improved security, considering that military officers are still occupying the positions of state governor, even though al- Bashir‚Äôs administration had already been ousted since April last year. Following the attacks, a state of emergency was declared by the provincial government in the region, adding that more troops would be sent to the affected areas, as well as nearby towns. The United Nations and African Union mission in Darfur (UNAMID) also stated that it had sent a delegation to Northern Darfur‚Äôs Kutum town, amidst the ongoing violence in the area. However, the acting governor of North Darfur, Maj Gen Malik Khojali assured the UNAMID and other humanitarian organisations that peace had been restored in both Kutum and Fata Borno, while urging relief organisations to come to the aid of victims of the violence. On 17 July, several Sudanese in Khartoum came out to criticise the new government reforms which they considered to be anti- Islamic. Also, protesters in the east and north of Khartoum joined the demonstrations which began after Muslims‚Äô Friday prayers, as they chanted slogans against secularism and the replacement of laws made by God. In anticipation of the protests, bridges connecting to Khartoum were shut down by security forces from 6:00 p.m on Thursday, to the end of Friday, according to the Khartoum State‚Äôs Security Committee. Some of these reforms included permitting non-Muslims to consume alcohol, as well as decriminalising the conversion from Islam to other religions. Different mosques across Sudan during the Friday prayers, blamed the government for defecting from Islamic laws and encouraged the people to see to the end of Prime Minister Abdallah Hamdok‚Äôs present administration. On 21 July, Sudan‚Äôs former President Omar al- Bashir was taken to a courtroom in the capital Khartoum to face trial for partaking in the 1989 coup that brought him into power. Despite being already sentenced on the charges of corruption, there‚Äôs a possibility that al-Bashir might be given the death penalty, if convicted for the 1989 coup, the BBC added. Al-Bashir is also wanted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) on the allegations of crimes against humanity, genocide and other war crimes in Darfur. Prior to statements/evidence being presented, the court decided to adjourn the trial to 11 August, in order to resume in a much larger court which would accommodate more lawyers and family relatives of the defendants. On 26 July, UN officials disclosed that a new wave of violence erupted in West Darfur, which led to the death of over 60 people and 60 others injured, the Jakarta Post reported. On Saturday afternoon, about 500 gunmen were said to have attacked Masteri Town, north of Beida, in Darfur, setting houses and part of the local market on fire, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) of the UN revealed in a statement. In light of the attack, about 500 locals were said to have organised a protest calling for increased security, refusing to bury the dead until immediate actions are taken by the authorities. Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok assured the delegation of women he met with from the region Sunday, that security forces would be dispatched in order to ensure that the citizens are protected, as well as the agricultural season. He added that a joint security force comprising both the army and police would be deployed in the five states of the Darfur region for increased protection. August 2020 On 17 August, as the civilian-military power- sharing deal marked one year, several Sudanese protesters took to the streets in Khartoum to demand faster reforms, including the election of a legislative body. Near the Council of Ministers, several protesters were sighted waving the Sudanese flags and chanting for quicker reforms. Some protesters, including security forces were said to have been injured when security forces used tear gas in order to break up the gathering of thousands of protesters marking the anniversary. Demonstrators in Omdurman and many other cities were also said to have joined the protests, with the majority of the protesters gathering outside the cabinet headquarters in the capital Khartoum. Since Condoleezza Rice‚Äôs visit to Sudan in 2005, Mike Pompeo has now become the first US secretary of state to visit Sudan on Tuesday, 25 August. During Pompeo‚Äôs visit, he met with the Sudanese Sovereign Council Chair General Abdel Fattah el-Burhan in Khartoum, and also planned to meet with the Prime Minister of Sudan Abdalla Hamdok. The US State department revealed that the meeting aims to address US backing of the transitional government in Sudan, as well as strengthen relations between Sudan and Israel. However, the Sudanese PM has told Pompeo that he is not yet authorised to normalise ties with Israel, pending the establishment of interim bodies which would deliberate on the issue. On 28 August, protests reportedly broke out in eastern Sudan‚Äôs Kassala town, where demonstrators urged Sudan‚Äôs leader to remove the governor of Kassala state Saleh Ammar, maintaining that he is incompetent to occupy the position. The protests later turned violent when supporters of Governor Saleh were accused of shooting protesters which resulted in the death of four people and six others wounded, according to VOA News. Several people were said to have stormed the Kassala Grand Market with knives and sticks, setting many shops ablaze. Following the clashes, the Sudanese government has declared a state of emergency in Kassala and sent security reinforcements to avoid further spread of the crisis. On 31 August, the Sudanese government signed a groundbreaking peace deal with Sudan‚Äôs five top rebel groups. The deal was signed in the capital of South Sudan, Juba, in an attempt to resolve the long- standing conflict that has ravaged the country. It also aims to address important issues regarding land ownership, security, power sharing, as well as allowing the insurgents to join the army. Despite the union of rebel groups from the western region of Darfur and the southern states of South Kordofan and Blue Nile, including the Sudan Revolutionary Front (SRF) have signed the peace deal, two other groups have reportedly abstained from participating in the peace process. October 2020 On 3 October, the transitional government of Sudan sealed a peace deal with many rebel groups in an attempt to resolve conflicts that have destabilized the country for years. The deal was signed during a ceremony in South Sudan‚Äôs capital Juba, between the Sudanese government, Sudan Revolutionary Front (SRF), and a coalition of rebel groups. According to France 24, two other powerful rebel groups refused to participate in signing the peace deal. The two rebel groups included those fighting in Darfur and in the southern part of the country. The Sudanese President Abdel Fatah al-Burhan, Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdock, South Sudan Vice President Dr Riek Machar, including dignitaries from Somalia, Uganda, Chad, among others, were all able to attend the event in Juba. The dignitaries were said to have added their names to the agreement, including the African Union (AU), European Union (EU) and United Nations (UN). In addition to the three main groups that signed a preliminary deal in August, Abdelaziz al-Hilu‚Äôs powerful rebel group, Sudan People‚Äôs Liberation Movement-North, also assented to engaging in peace talks presented by South Sudan last month. On 4 October, protesters responded to the recent signing of a peace deal between the Sudanese government and rebel groups which took place on Saturday, by closing the Southern Port of Sudan. The road linking the eastern city and the capital was shut down by the protesters, including Port Sudan‚Äôs container terminal. The protests were said to have been largely conducted by the members of the Port Sudan Workers Union, as they criticized the failure of the deal to cater for the demands of eastern Sudanese appropriately. Aboud el-Sherbiny, head of the Port Sudan Workers Union disclosed that workers in both the southern port and Suakin port had embarked on a strike, following the peace deal. The workers are calling for the termination of the peace deal, as well as the eastern track, El-Sherbiny added. They have also vowed to continue the protests, unless the Sudanese government attends to their demands. Salva Kiir, President of South Sudan has called on the international community to provide assistance, in order to ensure successful implementation of the peace deal, according to Al-Awsat. On 13 October, the governor of Kassala state, Saleh Ammar was reportedly sacked by Sudan‚Äôs Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok over inter-tribal conflict and last week‚Äôs blockade of Port Sudan‚Äôs container terminal in eastern Sudan. Ammar‚Äôs dismissal came three months after his appointment, which was immediately followed by deadly protests that led to the death of at least five with several others injured. The governor subsequently accused supporters of former leader al-Bashir of being responsible for the protests, although he couldn‚Äôt provide proof to back his claim, Associated Press added. After his appointment in July, Ammar had to stay in Khartoum, due to being prohibited by demonstrators from entering Kassala, who rejected his appointment on the basis of tribe. Later in the evening, in response to the dismissal of the Kassala state governor, demonstrators were said to have shut down roads and burnt tires in Kassala town, according to Dabanga Sudan. No injuries were reported during the protests, according to Arab News. A new appointment to replace the provincial governor has not been made yet by the Sudanese Prime Minister. On 15 October, the heavy protests which erupted, following the government‚Äôs decision to fire Kassala‚Äôs civilian governor Saleh Ammar, claimed the lives of 8 people, the Sudanese government revealed. Several others were said to have been wounded during the clashes between the protesters and security forces. All those who were killed and wounded are believed to be protesters, who were assaulted with swords and knives, a doctors' committee maintained. Sudan's information minister and spokesman, Faisal Mohamed Saleh, stated that a three- day state of emergency was declared in Kassala state by the central government amidst the violent protests.

He is regarded as a folk hero among the Tausugs. Uprising In 1948, starting with a core group of 25 members, Kamlon launched an uprising to clear the issue of land reform, overthrow the Philippine government, and assert the sovereignty of the Sultanate of Sulu and North Borneo over the Tausugs. Eventually, with his anti-Filipino campaign gaining traction, Kamlon's following grew to around 100 members. Armed mainly with M1918 Browning Automatic Rifles and a variety of Japanese rifles from the war, the group became known for wiping out the 7th Infantry Battalion, the Korean War veteran unit called Nenita. The gravity of Kamlon's threat shook the newly independent republic as it simultaneously dealt with other internal threats such as the communist movement Hukbalahap. Meanwhile, the Philippine government tried to sully Kamlon's name by branding him as a bandit, criminal, and rebel, among others, to blunt his image and reputation among the people. =Temporary peace and resumption of conflict= After his surrender, Kamlon meets with President Ramon Magsaysay. In July 1952, more than 5,000 troops supported by tanks, aircraft, and naval units were mobilized to flush out Kamlon, this time led by then Defense Secretary Ramon Magsaysay. On July 31 of the same year, Kamlon surrendered, not because of the ensuing offensive, but in response to Magsaysay's secret meeting with him in Sulu. By this time, Kamlon had some 300 warriors with him, and was considered the second largest threat to the Philippines next to the Hukbalahap. However, observers were quick to judge Kamlon's actions as a farce, likely to serve as relief from the fighting. President Elpidio Quirino himself dispelled any claims that he shook hands with Kamlon as a result of this surrender. This doubt would be justified when in August 1952, a week after his surrender, Kamlon returned to continue his rebellion, and the Filipino troops were back in Sulu to fight against his forces. The resulting battle caused 20 casualties on Kamlon's side. A few months later, in November, Kamlon once again surrendered. With 23 of his men, they were convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. It would not take long before Kamlon was out again to resume his rebellion. This cycle would go on until September 24, 1955, when Kamlon delivered his unconditional surrender after a battle with the 2nd Infantry Division, Sulu Air Task Group (SATAG, composed of 6th and 7th Fighter Squadrons), and a gunboat of the Philippine Navy that cost him 190 of his fighters. The entire seven-year campaign cost the government ( in 2019 figures). Imprisonment Kamlon's initial conviction was upheld and he was sentenced to life imprisonment, a condition Kamlon himself contested, claiming that his surrender was not entirely unconditional because there was \\"a promise of a parole\\". However, the Philippine government countered with the justification that Kamlon was not promised anything beyond his partial pardon. Since he had violated the conditions of his pardon, he was disqualified. The conditions included a monthly report from Kamlon to the Philippine Constabulary, his assistance to the surrender of rebels and firearms in the Sulu area, and his permission to be regularly visited by an authority from the Philippine government. Among those who worked for his release was Nur Misuari, later chairman of the Moro National Liberation Front. For those who survived the uprising, and those who would follow the path of Moro rebellion, the aging Kamlon was viewed as a pioneer in fighting for independence and liberty. He was finally granted a pardon by President Ferdinand Marcos. Popular culture Kamlon was portrayed by Ramon Revilla in the 1981 film Kamlon. The film was an entry in the 1981 Metro Manila Film Festival.

In 1809, Napoleon invaded Austria, establishing base camp in Linz for wounded soldiers. Johann supplied the French army with their medical needs; this enabled Johann to prosper. In 1812 Johann announced that he intended to marry Th√©r√®se Obermeyer, his housekeeper. Ludwig van Beethoven, returning home from a stay at the spa resort of Teplitz, visited his brother in Linz. He regarded the proposed marriage as unsuitable, and tried to dissuade him. He also appealed to the local authority. He was not successful; Johann married Th√©r√®se Obermeyer on 8 November 1812. They had no children. Johann bought Schloss Wasserhof, an estate in Gneixendorf, in 1819. After the purchase, he signed a letter to Ludwig \\"From your brother Johann, landowner\\".

In autumn 1826, the composer visited Johann in Gneixendorf. During his stay he wrote the finale to his String Quartet Op. 130, the last music he completed.

His nose was large and rather long; his eyes were not evenly set, so that one got the impression he had a cast in one eye.... In his clothing he played the well-to-do dandy, but that did not suit his bony, angular figure. He bore no resemblance whatever to his brother Ludwig.\\"H. C. Robbins Landon.

In 2017, Deng and his collaborator, Chen Hu of the 307 Hospital, used CRISPR gene editing to transplant human hematopoietic stem cells with the edited CCR5 gene to mice, and conferred HIV resistance to the animals. They subsequently used the technique to treat an AIDS patient who suffered from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). It was the first time CRISPR was used on a human HIV patient. 19 months later, the patient's ALL was in complete remission. Their research demonstrated the safety of CRISPR for humans, although the therapy was not effective for curing AIDS as only 5% to 8% of the patient's bone marrow cells carried the edited CCR5 gene, much lower than the ideal 100%. Their findings were published in The New England Journal of Medicine in September 2019.

Both her parents immigrated to Canada in the 1960s where they met and have resided ever since. She received a Bachelor of Arts double degree in mass communications and political science from York University in Toronto. While studying Spanish in M√°laga she was nicknamed ‚Äúgringlish girl‚Äù, which she adopted as her nickname. She also adopted the middle name Laia, shortened from the Greek feminine given name Eulalia (), which means ‚Äúwell-spoken.‚Äù Vlahos is fluent in English, French, Greek and Spanish.  Star Foodies!  In 2016 Vlahos created the concept for Star Foodies!, a half-hour travel and cooking show with a celebrity focus. The multi-lingual subtitled show was picked up by Canada's OMNI 1 channel and debuted nationally on 27 October 2018. The first season, subtitled Greece Edition, resulted from Vlahos living between Greece and Canada. In each episode sees Vlahos meet with a Greek celebrity to talk about life and food, before heading back to Canada to re-create a personal recipe of the celebrity with a Canadian Chef. The first episode of the series included Greek singer and actor Sakis Rouvas, and Canadian Chef Christine Cushing recreating Rouvas' personal recipe for Pastitsada, a dish from his home island of Corfu. The show has garnered mainstream press within Canada, The Toronto Sun's Senior Lifetyle and Food editor, Rita DeManontis described \\"the premise of the show (as) simple, yet unique\\".

The company was unable to raise the money it needed to build the line, and it substantially reduced its scope to connecting collieries around Rothwell with the existing main line network nearby. This was successful, with trains running from 1890, but the company decided it would find a way to connect to Leeds and operate a much truncated passenger service, from Rothwell. It sponsored the South Leeds Junction Railway to make a connection from Rothwell to the Midland Railway at Stourton; the SLJR was soon re-absorbed by the E&WYUR.; The passenger service started on 4 January 1904 but it was a disastrous failure, and it was soon withdrawn from 1 October 1904. The E&WYUR; continued as a successful mineral railway, being taken into the London and North Eastern Railway at the grouping of the railways in 1923. The network closed in 1966 as the collieries had ceased operation. Background The E&WYUR; network in 1894In the last quarter of the nineteenth century there was a considerable upsurge in the coal industry in Yorkshire. At the same time there was dissatisfaction with the facilities provided by the established railway companies, and indeed with their charges. From the railways' point of view, huge capital investment in rolling stock and in infrastructure was being called for at a time when money was limited.Wrottesley, volume II, page 162 The Hull and Barnsley Railway (H&BR;) was authorised by Act of 26 August 1880 with the principal object of providing a direct link for mineral traffic from West Yorkshire coalfields to the Port of Hull; the project was partly motivated by resentment at the monopoly of the North Eastern Railway in serving Hull. The Parliamentary Bill for the H&BR; had asked for wide-ranging running powers over existing railways to Sheffield, Leeds, Bradford, Huddersfield, Halifax, Manchester and Liverpool, but these had all been struck out when the Act received the Royal Assent. The line was a considerable engineering project at this time, and as work progressed, it became obvious that the company was unable to raise the money it needed, and in fact it never completed its network.Joy, page 226Grant, page 273 E&WYUR; promoted The H&BR; thought it essential to get access to Leeds for passenger traffic from Hull, and it encouraged promotion of a line from Drax, on its own main line, to Ardsley on the Great Northern Railway. The line was to cross the Midland Railway at Woodlesford and make a connection there, and also connect a colliery network at Rothwell, four miles south-east of Leeds. At Ardsley, it was hoped, running powers over the Great Northern Railway would be granted to Leeds and Bradford. The Woodlesford connection would allow for an alternative route to Leeds. Rothwell was the focus of a group of collieries owned by Henry Charlesworth of J & J Charlesworth & Co Limited; high quality stone was quarried locally as well. The Charlesworth group of collieries had connections to railways, but there was considerable attraction for them in a new direct railway to Hull docks.Joy, pages 57 to 59Suggitt, pages 26, 27 and 30 The result was the Parliamentary authorisation on 2 August 1883 of the East and West Yorkshire Union Railway. The hoped-for running powers over the Midland Railway and the Great Northern Railway were refused. The main line from Drax was an ambitious project of about 30 miles of railway across difficult terrain. The E&WYUR; soon found that raising the considerable capital sum for its main line was impossible, and in 1886 it got an abandonment Act. The intended line to Drax was to be abandoned, but short branch lines to Lofthouse (near Ardsley) on the GNR and Woodlesford on the Midland Railway were added (or modified), so that the proposed network was about nine miles in extent including siding complexes. Running powers from Lofthouse to Leeds Central over the GNR were requested--passenger operation was still contemplated on the abbreviated system--but these were refused.Grant, pages 165 and 166 Opening of a limited network By November 1890 the line was nearly ready at the Ardsley end, so that some coal could come from the Rothwell collieries over the E&WYUR; onto the GNR. However there was a dispute with the GNR over the junction, and it was only resolved when the GNR were given running powers on the E&WYUR.; On 19 May 1891 the line was fully open as far as Rothwell. Robin Hood Colliery was a collection point for other collieries, and GNR engines worked to and from that point; the colliery engines moved the wagons beyond that point. Considerable volumes of coal were now brought to the GNR for onward transit. Continuously short of money for construction purposes, the E&WYUR; approached the GNR in February 1892, asking it to take it over. The GNR board was willing to consider this, but was cautious about the financial commitment it would be making, and referred the matter to a sub-committee. The issue became complicated: at this time Hunslet had become a major industrial and commercial growth area, and business interests put forward a new line to the north of the E&WYUR;, from Beeston to Hunslet; this group approached the GNR for support. At the same time the E&WYUR; proposed an extension of its own line to Hunslet, which was to be called the South Leeds Junction Railway. The GNR considered its position on these conflicting proposals, and decided that the line from Beeston would be better, being more direct and involving less property demolition. That line became the Hunslet Railway, opened in 1899 by the Great Northern Railway.Grant, page 275 In May 1892, takeover negotiations between the GNR and the E&WYUR; broke down, as the E&WYUR; wanted 4% on its share capital, a demand the GNR would not meet.Wrottesley volume III, page 69 The Beeston to Hunslet scheme proceeded separately, and had no further connection with the E&WYUR.;Wrottesley, volume III, page 70 Situation in 1900 An article in Railway Magazine in August 1900 describes some contemporary features: > The situation of the railway made it a rather costly line to construct, the > capital expenditure being up to the present time about ¬£250,000... The > Capital expenditure includes the many yards and sidings, the extent of which > nearly equals the mileage of the railway. The principal traffic... is coal > and stone. The traffic is derived from seven collieries and a number of > quarries working the well known Robin Hood stone, which is sent all over > England for window sills and stone work of that description... The railway > is in a very flourishing condition financially, having paid 1 per cent > dividend on its ordinary stock for several years past...A Modern Mineral > Railway: The East and West Yorkshire Union Railway, in the Railway Magazine, > August 1900 South Leeds Junction Railway The E&WYUR; proposal for the South Leeds Junction Railway was authorised on 24 August 1893, but in a much-modified form: it was to be a two-mile line from Rothwell to sidings at Stourton, two miles west of Woodlesford, alongside the Midland Railway line. This connected in more collieries, and it opened on 6 April 1895. Considerable volumes of coal came to the GNR off the line. The South Leeds Junction Railway was worked by the E&WYUR;, and it was acquired by the E&WYUR; company by an Act of 2 July 1896.Grant, page 523Joy, page 244 Branches A further branch was authorised on 14 December 1897 from Robin Hood to Royds Green Lower; it was authorised under the Light Railways Act of 1896, only the second line to be treated in this way. A third branch was the Thorpe Branch, which was built in 1899. The final result was a railway that had numerous small branches serving collieries in a small area. A short extension was opened on 1 November 1903 from Stourton to Stourton Junction on the Midland Railway, providing a running line connection. Passenger trains The E&WYUR; network in 1904Workmen's services were operated on a branch from Robin Hood to Royds Green Lower, sanctioned by the Light Railway Order, and opened by 1898. A Light Railway Order made on 7 June 1901 permitted the company to operate its main line as a light railway and build a new branch alongside the Pontefract-Leeds road as far as the tramway terminus at Thwaite Gate (at this stage not making a junction with the Midland Railway). The intention was to operate a passenger service in connection with the trams, but this scheme was abandoned when work started on a conventional street tramway linking Wakefield and Leeds via Stourton, with a branch to Robin Hood. Undaunted, the E&WYUR; decided to compete firectly with the trams and on 4 January 1904 introduced a passenger service between Robin Hood and Leeds Wellington station. It was a disastrous failure, losing ¬£200 per month; Sunday services were withdrawn in August 1904, and the entire service was withdrawn from 1 October of the same year, only six weeks after the opening of the rival tram route. Suggitt remarks: > The provision... of a separate passenger service on the E&WYUR; made little > sense. Horse drawn wagonettes already ran to Leeds and a scheme for electric > trams to Wakefield had been approved in 1902. [To enable passenger > operation,] a junction with the Midland main line at Stourton had to be > built, the SLJR section of track doubled, modern signalling installed, and > platforms built at the three stations of Robin Hood, Rothwell and Stourton. Operating methods The E&WYUR; had an unusual operating system: no block working was used, and only the Royds Green Lower Branch used a staff and ticket method. All train movements had to be made on a siding basis, driving at sight. Proper signalling had to be provided for the passenger service. The 1900 Railway Magazine article includes the observation that \\"Although the railway is worked as a single line, a large portion of it is already doubled\\". The residual E&WUYR; The E&WYUR; had been constructed as a domestic Charlesworth network, and only limited attempts had been made to document land ownership. In a number of cases E&WYUR; lines were built on Charlesworth property; the company had purchased land from Charlesworths in 1899, but Charlesworths retained certain reservations. For some time this did not matter, but the LNER later found that it was a problematic issue. The E&WYUR; remained independent until the Grouping of the railways in 1923, when it was taken over by the London and North Eastern Railway. After 1923 The E&WYUR; lines were all closed by 3 October 1966, the line east of Rothwell had been dormant since February 1962.

It features the historical figures William Douglas, 6th Earl of Douglas (the \\"Black Douglas\\") and Gilles de Retz (\\"Bluebeard\\"), though in reality they never met. It is set in Scotland and France in the fifteenth century and blends history with supernatural elements. The novel is cited as an influence for J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. Synopsis The arms of William Douglas The young Earl William of Douglas stops by Malise McKim's smithy to get his horse shod. Malise's sons, Sholto and Laurence, are also there. Earl William rides on into the evening and meets a beautiful young woman. She leads him to a pavilion in the forest. She says she is part of a French delegation and suggests that he accompanies her to Edinburgh, which he rejects. The seduction is interrupted by Malise and the Abbot of Dulce Cor who insist the woman is a witch. Earl William is dragged away against his will. Earl William holds a wapenshaw at Threave Castle, the Douglas stronghold. Laurence pleases the Abbott with his singing and joins the Abbey. Sholto becomes Captain of the Guard. He is in love with Maud, the companion of Margaret Douglas, Fair Maid of Galloway, Earl William's younger sister. A French delegation led by Gilles de Retz arrives. In the delegation is the mysterious woman, who Earl William learns is named Lady Sybilla. In the night, a wolf-like creature invades the chamber of Margaret and Maud. Sholto wounds it as it escapes. On the third day, they hold a melee. De Retz moves to target Earl William, but Sholto steps in to defend him. The Frenchman is knocked unconscious. His armour is stripped off, revealing he has a wound similar to that given to the wolf-like creature. Sholto is knighted. A week or two later, De Retz, Sir Alexander Livingston, Lord Chancellor William Crichton, and James, Earl of Avondale hold a council in Stirling Castle. They all agree on the need to get rid of Earl William, who is too powerful. Lady Sybilla is revealed as the secret weapon who will lure him to Edinburgh. Earl William receives letters from Crichton and Lady Sybilla, convincing him, against the advice of others, to go to Crichton Castle. His younger brother David, Sholto, and some men-at-arms accompany him. Earl William and Lady Sybilla spend a lot of time together alone. She warns him to leave, he refuses, and she declares her love for him. The next morning, he finds De Retz and Lady Sybilla have left for Edinburgh. He receives a message from Lady Sybilla, telling him not to follow her and to forget her. Though Sholto argues against him, he decides to follow her to Edinburgh. Earl William is welcomed to a banquet with the young King James in Edinburgh Castle. He is served with the head of a black bull, the symbol of death. (This was a real historical event known as the Black Dinner.) Earl William is accused of treason, over the protests of the king. He, David, and Sholto are imprisoned. In the night, Malise, Laurence, and others try to rescue them, but the Earl refuses to leave the Lady Sybilla, and David refuses to leave him. The Earl orders Sholto to escape and raise the troops. The next morning, Earl William is put on trial. Under questioning by De Retz, Lady Sybilla admits that she had persuaded Earl William to come to Edinburgh to his death. Regardless, Earl William declares his love for her. He and David are beheaded. Sholto and the others raise the Clan Douglas, who march against Edinburgh. He meets Lady Sybilla, pale with grief. She tells him to watch out for Maud and Magaret. When he returns to Threave, they have disappeared. Malise, Sholto, Laurence, and James of Douglas, Earl William's cousin, go to France, convinced that De Retz has kidnapped Maud and Margaret. They capture a ruffian, who happens to be in the service of De Retz. Without telling the others, Laurence frees him and joins the service of De Retz. The others head to De Retz's Castle of Machecoul. They stay at the home of an old man, who warns them of his wife, La Meffraye. In the night, the old man is killed by a wolf. They escape and fight off a pack of werewolves. Meanwhile, inside the castle, Laurence discovers an iron altar on which De Retz conducts Satanic sacrifices of children. La Meffraye is one of his servants. Lady Sybilla finds the others in the forest and gives them a list of children killed by De Retz. She also reveals she has second sight. They rouse the peasants and convince the Duke of Brittany to lead his army against the castle. They rescue Margaret and Maud. The soldiers arrest De Retz, who is tried and executed. Maud and Sholto agree to get married. Sequel Crockett published a sequel, Maid Margaret, following the life of Margaret Douglas, in 1905. Reception Crockett was a best-selling novelist in his day, and The Black Douglas was one of his most famous books. Legacy Fantasy author J.R.R. Tolkien wrote of being impressed as a boy by The Black Douglas. He said he based the battle with the wargs in The Lord of the Rings on the battle with werewolves. However Tolkien said that he hadn't read the novel as an adult. Scholar Douglas A. Anderson has drawn parallels with the attack of the wargs in The Hobbit. In addition, in his opinion, the ending of the chapter \\"The Battle of the Werewolves\\" in The Black Douglas is similar to the end of \\"The Siege of Gondor\\" in The Lord of the Rings. Jared Lobdell has suggested The Black Douglas's overall style and imagery had an influence on Tolkien, and that De Retz inspired Tolkien's character, Sauron. Sholto's secret mail-coat may have inspired Frodo's mithril coat.

The new requirements for access to the legal profession in Spain are: Bachelor's Degree in Law (4 years), Master of Laws, Legal Internship, State Examination for Access to the Legal Profession and the Lawyer's Professional Title.  History  Until 2011, one could gain access to the legal profession with just a Bachelor¬¥s Degree in Law (Licenciatura en Derecho), not to be confused with the Bachelor of Laws. It was possible for new graduates to just join any Bar Association and practice law. This situation however, involved an imbalance in the system of accessing the legal profession between countries because there were countries where you could practice law directly with only a law degree (Spain), while in others, a postgraduate degree was required, and in others, a postgraduate degree and state examination. This imbalanced situation brought many foreign citizens, in whose countries postgraduate and state examination was required, to Spain and through this legal loophole they acceded to legal practice without postgraduate or state examination. However, with the entry into the European Union, which sought political and economic integration, the Bologna Process arrived and unified ways of accessing legal practice in European countries. To this we must also add the complaints of the legal profession in Spain (many lawyers put pressure on the government). For all this, the access system was changed. After EU's Directive 2005/36/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 September 2005 on the recognition of professional qualifications and in order to unite all legal practice systems, Spain reformed the accessing the legal profession with the Law 34/2006, of 30 October, on Access to the Professions of Lawyer and Court RepresentativeLey 34/2006, de 30 de octubre, sobre el acceso a las profesiones de Abogado y Procurador de los Tribunales. and to apply and develop this Law the Royal Decree 775/2011, of 3 June, which approves the rules set by the LAC was passed by Spanish Government.Real Decreto 775/2011, de 3 de junio, por el que se aprueba el Reglamento de la Ley 34/2006, de 30 de octubre, sobre el acceso a las profesiones de Abogado y Procurador de los Tribunales. In order to obtain the Lawyer's Professional Title, it is now necessary to have the following: *Bachelor¬¥s Degree in Law (4 years) * Master of Laws * Legal Internship (2 years) * State Examination for Access to the Legal Profession  Bachelor's Degree in Law (Bolonia)  The Bachelor's Degree in Law (in Spain) is the academic degree conferred on those who have successfully completed a law study process at a university or institution of higher studies. Not to be confused with the Bachelor of Laws. It is important to differentiate between two types of the Bachelor's Degree in Law: the one previous to the Bologna Process and the later one. The one previous to the Bologna Process was composed of 5 years, with specialization and without legal internship. The current one consists of 4 years, with internship and to specialize it is necessary to study a master's degree.  Master of Laws and Legal Internship  The Master of Laws is a postgraduate academic degree, pursued by those holding a Bacherlor's Degree in Law and it is the basic professional degree for admission into legal practice. In Spain this master has different names according to the university that offers it, including: Master's Degree in Legal Practice, Master's Degree in Advocacy, Master's Degree in Legal Profession. The master's degree in legal practice is made up of one or two years depending on the university that offers it and consists of 90 ECTS credits. As to the legal internship, according to article 17 of the Royal Decree 775/2011, of 3 June, which approves the rules set by the LAC, it will involve a minimum of 30 ECTS credits, which means a minimum of 750 hours (6 months).  State Examination for Access to the Legal Profession  According to article 17 of the Royal Decree 775/2011, of 3 June, which approves the rules set by the LAC, the exam is written and consists of two parts that are done on the same day. The first exercise consists of an objective test of multiple answers and the second exercise of the evaluation will consist of solving a practical case previously chosen by the applicant among several alternatives. The evaluation test has a total duration of 4 hours and consists of: * 50 questions on ¬´Common subjects in the practice of the legal profession¬ª. * 25 questions on ¬´Specific subjects¬ª according to the legal specialty (civil and commercial, criminal, administrative and labor) * In addition, the questionnaire includes six reservation questions for the section ¬´Common subjects exercising the legal profession¬ª and two for each legal specialty of the section ¬´Specific subjects¬ª. The final result of the State Test is a qualification of \\"Apt\\" or \\"Unfit\\", without numerical result. The result of the test is weighted with the Master of Access to Law and Legal Practice, the test being 70% and the master 30% of the final result. However, due to the high percentage of people who present themselves and pass the exam, the lawyers filed several complaints and are currently negotiating a new tougher access test with the Ministry of Justice, which they want to implement before 2022. The new Model of access to the legal profession that is being negotiated will have: * A practical oral test before a court of a specific area of law chosen by the student * Elimination of the average between the exam and the master * Make passing the test mandatory to obtain the title * Grant a final numerical note to the applicant  Lawyer's Professional Title  The Lawyer's Professional TitleOfficial name according to the Law 34/2006, of 30 October, on Access to the Professions of Lawyer and Court Representative. is the professional license in Spain to practice law, which allows legal practice in Spain and the EU.

Once you have passed the State Examination for Access to the Legal Profession, the Ministry of Justice of the Spanish Government gives you the Lawyer's Professional Title and with it you can join a Bar Association and practice law.  Joining a Bar Association  In Spain it is mandatory to join a Bar Association to practice law and the requirement to join a Bar Association is to be in possession of the Lawyer's Professional Title. The incorporation into a single Bar Association is sufficient to practice throughout the national territory, being that Bar Association the sole professional domicile or principal domicile of the lawyer.

It is a B listed building because of its historic interest.https://her.highland.gov.uk/Monument/MHG20493 History Historically these bunkers were important in the processing of the Chain Home RADAR signals https://www.radarpages.co.uk/mob/ch/chainhome.htm for a large part of Scotland. The Filter Bunker was staffed primarily by the WAAF Women's Auxiliary Air Force. It was operated by the RAF up until (about) 1943 ‚Äì being used by both the No. 13 Group RAF and later the No. 14 Group RAF. Subsequent to that the Royal Auxiliary Air Force (RAuxAF - known in the UK as RAAF) used the building until the 1950s. The filter bunker was used by the Civil Defence Corps from 1958 and by the Royal Observer Corps from 1968; it was acquired by Highland Council for use as their emergency centre in 1988. The two other bunkers ‚Äì operations room bunker and the communications centre bunker ‚Äì have both been demolished or built over since the war. The building was designed to survive direct strikes from the German 2-ton bomb ‚Äì the largest known at the time of construction example the SC2000. It achieved this by having a 1m deep concrete cap sitting top of a 1-metre-deep shingle base. The filter bunker consists of two subterranean levels, each floor about 40 metres √ó 12 metres. In 1988‚Äì1990 the Filter Bunker was renovated (apparently with the help of a ¬£500,000 central government grant). This was to make the building some form of Regional Centre of Government. In addition to being double airlocked, the bunker was refitted with two diesel generators and the previous gas-only air filtration system was replaced with a new system that filters nuclear, chemical, and biological contaminants. Internally the bunker was structured to have \\"the pit\\", where information gleaned from the RADAR was interpreted and placed on maps. Above the pit, higher-ranked officials would interpret the information and send it to the operations bunker. Prior to 1989, there was no floor above \\"the pit\\" (room 43), with rooms 19‚Äì22 removed and only an L-shaped walkway in its place. In 2016 the filter room bunker was put up for sale by the Highland Regional Council. In 2019 it moved into private hands and is now owned by CSP Partnership.

He is a member of the Heroic Warriors, notable by his distinctive appearance, with his large, blue metal head on which his faces appear in its screen-like opening. His ability is to change his face from his regular human face to that of a robot and a monster. The purposes for which he uses his faces have varied throughout different media. Initially conceived as an actor cursed with a split personality, in the two cartoon series he uses his faces for the purpose of playing different roles as well as additional powers. The original figure's tagline was \\"Heroic Human... Robot... Monster\\". Character history =Original character= After the initial 1982 wave, Man-E-Faces was one of the first characters conceived for the second, 1983 wave. His 'feature' was that a dial on top of his head could be rotated, allowing one of three faces (human, monster or robot) to be visible at the front of his helmet. The figure came with an orange laser gun, making him one of the few characters from the line to carry a firearm. This gun was later recycled (in the same color) in the Weapons Pak. The purple detailing of his armor can also be found to vary on some foreign versions. There was also an early release of the figure that came with a bonus selection of weapons. These were originally included in the Castle Grayskull play set and were presented in a maroon dye. This release has been dubbed \\"Man-E-Weapons\\" by fans, and is a sought after release on the collectors market. The character was showcased in the mini- comic \\"The Ordeal of Man-E-Faces\\". In this story, he is an actor who is captured by Skeletor and made to drink a potion which changes him into a vicious monster which attacks everyone it sees. The Sorceress involves herself and changes Man-E-Faces back to his human self, but Skeletor asserts his dominance and turns Man-E back into the monster. The struggle creates a third persona, a super-intelligent robot which is neither good nor evil. Although He-Man manages to free Man-E-Faces from Skeletor's spell, the robot and monster are now permanent parts of his character. He-Man vows to fight until Man-E is free from the curse. This version of the character also appears in the DC Comics miniseries, and the early UK annuals also present him in such way. =1980s cartoon series= In He-Man and the Masters of the Universe by Filmation, the portrayal of Man-E-Faces is somewhat changed. Rather than being cursed with a split personality, he is an actor who uses his alternate faces primarily for the purpose of playing roles on stage. He is also able to change to numerous other faces alongside his robot and monster faces. He is given an origin episode early in the series titled \\"The Mystery of Man-E-Faces\\". This episode reveals that he was originally a villain who terrorized others with his faces but not so much out of evil desires as personal insecurity and basic survival needs. He was an outcast feared by virtually everyone for his ability to change his face. This in turn made him \\"cold and cruel\\", so he began to abuse others out of retribution and to compensate for his personal crisis. He was captured by Skeletor, who intended to recruit him as a henchman. However, because he was not really evil, he had no desire to join Skeletor. For this reason, he was forced into fighting He-Man against his will when his monster face was controlled by Beast Man's power. He-Man believed that Man-E-Faces was not a villain, and the Sorceress agreed, so with urging from He-Man, the Sorceress used her magic to help Man-E-Faces overcome Skeletor's influence. Grateful for their help, he returned the favor by helping to thwart Skeletor's attack on Castle Grayskull. After telling them his story, feeling he had at last found the friendship and kindness he needed. The cartoon's version of the character uses his faces more for the purpose of acting rather than anything significant to battles. He is only used in one subsequent episode, \\"The Shadow of Skeletor\\", in which he uses his acting abilities to impersonate Beast Man, going undercover in a \\"Beast Man\\" disguise to spy on the Evil Warriors. Although initially conceived as one of the main characters of the franchise, he only makes two appearances in the Filmation cartoon series. The original script for the second season episode \\"Into the Abyss\\" was to feature a third appearance in the show by Man-E-Faces. In this episode, he would be rehearsing for a play in a scene in which Ram-Man was made to read out the part of Man-E- Faces' love interest, but the appearance was dropped before production. =2002 series= Man-E-Faces is featured in the 2002 relaunch of the Masters of the Universe toy line, and its accompanying cartoon series. His character was substantially developed from the old version; he is depicted as part of the regular team of warriors who aid He-Man, and his appearances are significantly more frequent. Although the new series stuck with Filmation's portrayal of him as an actor, the writers developed him by giving him the ability to use his different faces for different techniques useful in battle. His monster face provides him with extra courage and strength, while his robot face provides him with extra intelligence and the ability to scan people and objects for important data. The new series also portrays him as a chess champion when using his robot face. He is frequently referred to as 'Man-E- Robot' or 'Man-E-Monster' when using these faces. He is also given a mace as a weapon, which he uses as Man-E-Faces and Man-E-Monster, but can change into a blaster when he becomes Man-E-Robot. The episode \\"The Monster Within\\" gives him a split personality complex reminiscent of the original concept behind the character. This episode features his monster face falling under Beast Man's power over animals and attacking his fellow Masters. He subsequently feels guilty about what his weakness under Beast Man's powers has caused him to do and announces he will never play the role of the monster again. However, he later helps He-Man win the day by battling through the monster side of his personality and retaining touch with his true self when Beast Man next attempts to put the monster under his power. Using his acting skills, he tricks Beast Man into thinking he has succeeded, before fending off the Evil Warriors. Reception Man-E-Faces has had a mostly mixed reception from critics. io9 voted Man-E-Faces the 3rd Least Masterful Masters of the Universe toy. Gizmodo ranked Man-E-Faces 7th best toy in Masters of the Universe.

Character history =The 1980s= Roboto was introduced into the Masters of the Universe toy line in 1985. His first appearance is in the Mattel mini- comic \\"The Battle of Roboto\\", in which he is built by Man-At-Arms, who gives him a cybernetically-enhanced heart, which enables him to feel human emotions and interact with his comrades as a human rather than as a machine. He was an exceptionally brave fighter, even to the point of taking on Hordak in single combat in one issue. Given that the accompanying cartoon series was drawing to a close at the time his action figure was released, Roboto only makes one appearance in the cartoon, but unlike most other figures released at this time, Roboto was lucky enough to get a whole episode written around him. This episode, \\"Happy Birthday Roboto\\" features a radically different origin story for him, in which he was a space explorer from the alien world of Robotica, who crash-landed on Eternia.

Desiring to apply his chess skills to the real battle around him, he upgrades himself to a warrior robot and effectively transfers his skills into the Masters' combat. However, Teela refuses to let him join the fighting forces since he is not specifically designed for battle. However, during the prevailing incident of battling an army of small bone monsters controlled by Tri-Klops, which doubles its numbers every time it is destroyed, it is Roboto's analysis that determines the only way to defeat it is to attack Tri-Klops directly. To do so, Roboto advises He- Man of his idea and uses himself as a self-sacrifice to draw the enemy's attention to allow the superhero to approach his target. While He-Man is successful, Roboto is overwhelmed and seemingly destroyed before the enemy can be neutralized. Teela mourns his destruction and berates herself for not appreciating his courage and skills when offered.

According to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, his works are credited with being \\"among the most sophisticated silver vessels produced in the United States in the early nineteenth century.\\" Rasch was born in Bavaria, probably in the Schloss Kleeberg, as the second son of Maximilian, Count von Tauffkirchen, and his third wife, Gertrude. He trained as a goldsmith in Germany before arriving in Philadelphia, with his wife, on April 16, 1804. By 1806 Rasch had joined the Holy Trinity Catholic Church, and by 1807 he began working in the shop of French √©migr√© silversmith and retailer Jean-Simon Chaudron (1758‚Äì1846). In 1809 they became partners as Chaudron & Rasch, with Rasch running their manufactory on the Schuylkill River and Chaudron running the retail shop in Philadelphia. The 1810 federal census recorded 27 people living and working at Rasch's manufactory, the largest household in the township. The partners created sterling silverware sold as far away as New York and Virginia, usually stamped with two banner marks, \\"CHAUDRON'S & RASCH\\" and \\"STER‚Ä¢AMERI‚Ä¢MAN‚Ä¢\\" (an abbreviation for \\"Sterling, American Manufacture.\\") After their partnership dissolved in 1812, Rasch relocated to 118 High Street, where he created his own maker's mark and sterling standard mark, \\"ANTY. RASCH\\" and \\"STERLING SILR.\\" He dropped the sterling quality mark after two years but continued to mark his pieces \\"ANTY. RASCH\\" into 1817. By 1817 Rasch was partnered with George Willig Jr. (ca. 1795‚Äìc. 1860), likely a journeyman in Rasch's shop, as A. Rasch & Co.. Their business flourished as they made large, handwrought sterling silver pieces in \\"either French or English taste,\\" with applied cast ornament for customers in Boston, Maryland, and Philadelphia. They also made more affordable goods such as cups, goblets, and flatware, and retailed silver from France, Sheffield plate, and Saratoga water. However, the Panic of 1819 ruined them and in July 1819 they declared insolvency. In September they auctioned off their tools and household goods. In November 1819 Rasch moved to New Orleans. There he advertised his new business in January 1820, proposing to execute \\"conformably to either FRENCH or ENGLISH taste: complete setts or services of Silver Ware\\" and asking \\"of a generous public that portion of patronage to which his skill as a workman and conduct as a citizen may entitle him.\\" He was both a craftsman and merchant. In March 1821 he supplied the city of New Orleans with 200 street lamps for which he was paid $900 in May 1822. He also sold Saratoga water (1826) and the \\"celebrated Harrodsburgh Mineral Water\\" (1827). His shop and residence were in the Vieux Carr√©, from 1831 onwards at 75 (now 315) Chartres Street. In those years, Rasch often traveled to purchase goods for resale, including voyages to England, France, and Geneva. A cargo list from Rasch's 1829 trip to France includes eighteen cases, four trunks, two boxes, and one barrel of merchandise. In 1831 Rasch exhibited an elaborate musical clock made by Pierre Fr√©d√©ric Ingold and Fr√®res Rochat: :SPLENDID MECHANISM ‚Äî Mr. A. Rasch, well known to our citizens for his enterprise, has imported from France a most splendid clock, made in Paris by a Genevean [sic] about 70 years of age. It may be seen at his store....The whole is a finished, very ingenious and costly piece of work, well worthy the attention of the curious. The Panic of 1837 forced Rasch into a second bankruptcy. In 1842 he applied for relief from his creditors, and in 1845 his home, property, and most of his belongings were sold at public auction. However, his sons-in-law bought his slaves, home, and shop, and supported him for the remainder of his life. He returned to making silver. On January 20, 1849, Rasch advertised that \\"he continues to manufacture every variety of Gold and Silver Ware, and to set Diamonds in the most approved style.\\" He was buried in Saint Louis Cemetery No. 1 in New Orleans. His work is collected in the Art Institute of Chicago, Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston.

A missionary and author, he was responsible for translating the Gospels into Japanese and published the first research journal devoted to Japanese topics. He read and wrote broadly about Japanese culture, including studies of Buddhist history and mythology, and as a result came into conflict with some members of the Catholic missionary community. A trained musician, he also taught Western music in Japan and wrote early Western works on Japanese opera and music theory, and Noh drama. Biography No√´l P√©ri was born on 22 August 1865 in Cruzy-le-Ch√¢tel.H. Cordier. ‚ÄúNo√´l Peri.‚Äù T'oung Pao, vol. 21, no. 4, 1922, pp. 366‚Äì366. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/4526664. He was ordained a priest in 1888 after being educated by the Jesuits. He spent four years serving in the Paris Foreign Missions Society, resigning from the Mission in 1902 but continuing to regularly return to Japan until shortly before his death in 1922. P√©ri spent most of his first six years in Japan in Matsumoto, Nagano. During this period he translated two of the four Gospels into Japanese, and was briefly recalled to Tokyo to manage an orphanage. Around 1894 he relocated to Tokyo, where he ran a French bookstore and founded a Japanese-language magazine called Tenchijin ('Sky, Earth, and Man') that began to appear in 1898. P√©ri wrote about broad philosophical, metaphysical and moral issues but his inclination to avoid a narrowly Catholic or sectarian perspective created conflicts with more conservative elements of the Mission. This conflict led to P√©ri's departure from the Mission in 1902. P√©ri briefly worked as a journalist in Shanghai and was a regular contributor to L'√âcho de Chine, a French language newspaper, and occasional correspondent for l'Avenir du Tonkin. During his time working as a translator and missionary in Japan, P√©ri became interested in Asian philosophy and made extensive studies of the Chinese Buddhist canon. In 1904, he organized the publication of M√©langes, (M√©langes japonais after 1907), a journal aimed at missionaries but publishing widely on historical, philosophical, and literary aspects of Japanese culture. P√©ri contributed summaries of recently published Japanese works that surveyed Buddhist canonical literature and mythology, contributing significantly to knowledge of the Buddhist canon in the Francophone world. M√©langes was the first foreign journal devoted to Japanese topics, and remained so for the first several years of its publication. However, in 1910 Catholic authorities- possibly the same faction that had previously disagreed with P√©ri's approach to Tenchijin- forced M√©langes japonais to suspend publication. P√©ri was a trained musician and taught Western music at the Tokyo Conservatory of Music between 1896 and 1906.Farmer, Henry George. Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, no. 3, 1937, pp. 497‚Äì499. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/25201560. In addition to his teaching and other translation work, he published studies of Japanese opera and Noh in 1909 and 1912. P√©ri was appointed to a residence at the √âcole fran√ßaise d'Extr√™me- Orient in Hanoi in 1907, and served as secretary-librarian from 1911 until his death.√âcole fran√ßaise d'Extr√™me-Orient - Biography He continued to write on topics in Asian history, Buddhist literature and myth, and Japanese culture.

History The church has Saxon, or possibly Norman, origins, but was completely rebuilt at the end of the 15th century. It comprises a nave continuous with the chancel which is covered with a waggon shaped roof of Devon oak. The side aisle on the south side is separated from the nave by a three-bay arcade, supported by granite columns. The tower at the west end contains the ring of bells, which are rung from the floor of the church. The rood screen dates from the 15th century and was decorated in 1853 when the images of saints were added along the lower panels. The font is 15th century but had a wooden cover made in 1843 by Charles Finch, the parish clerk. In 1853, John Aggett carved the granite pulpit and lectern. He also carved the reredos in 1868 which was originally installed in Chagford church. In 1863 the rector, Arthur Whipham, submitted a petition for divorce from his wife on the grounds of her alleged adultery with Philip Rowe, a farmer‚Äôs son from Berrydown farm, Gidleigh. They were caught in bed together at the rectory by P.C. James Bird of the Devon constabulary. Organ The pipe organ sits at the back of the south aisle. It was built by Murdoch, Murdoch and Company of London and comprises 5 stops, A specification of the organ can be found in the National Pipe Organ Register. Bells The tower contains a peal of 5 bells with the three oldest dating from around 1450. Rectory The Old Rectory was built between 1896 and 1897 and occupied by the rectors of Gidleigh until the end of the 20th century. The first occupant was Reverend Burnett who moved in in 1897.

Clelland directed and chaired the confederation of curators, performance artists, designers and architectural practices who, together, designed and managed the 6,000 square-metre 'Glasgow's Glasgow' exhibition in 1990, when Glasgow was 'European Capital of Culture'. The design of the installation presented the history, present and future of the city within a three- dimensional, analogous geography, with the River Clyde at its centre. A small- scale conventional theatre and sequences of 'street theatre' that moved through the exhibition, brought life to the city's story. This temporary event, a keynote to 1990, was developed in association with the Glasgow Development Agency, the local Regional / District Councils and Commercial Sponsors. It was attended by over 500,000 visitors, the largest audience at that time to visit a temporary exhibition in Britain.

He was convivial company and famously brought, and shared, a bottle of the best Scotch Malt Whisky to a staff meeting. A series of such staff workshops convened by the new professor, completely altered the curriculum, orienting it towards architecture being part of the drive to confront Climate Change and to relate closely to the vitality of cities. During his tenure, the student numbers in the Architecture programmes quadrupled, with the highest increases at Post-graduate level. Doug left LJMU with a wonderful legacy of publications of Black Books, Yellow Books and Exhibition Catalogues; all graphically very strong and containing drawn and modelled speculative projects especially, but not solely, for The City Region of Merseyside.

It was designed by Thomas Talbot Bury and built in 1865‚Äì66. The church has been a Grade II listed building since 1984. History St Paul's was built as a chapel of ease to the parish church of St John the Baptist in Symondsbury. It was the second chapel of ease to be built in the parish, following St Peter's at Eype, which opened in 1865. Owing to the many outlying settlements and neighbourhoods which were a considerable distance from St John's, the rector of the parish, Rev. Henry Rawlinson, sought to improve church accommodation in the parish. The area of Broakoak was approximately three miles from the parish church, with the nearest church being at Salwayash. Plans for the church were drawn up by Thomas Talbot Bury of London and a plot of land purchased by Rev. Rawlinson from the trustees of the Bridport Charity. In addition to Broadoak, the church was sited to serve the hamlets of Henwood, Mowerbury, Dinhay, Atram and Hogboar. In addition to donations and subscriptions, a grant of ¬£20 was also received by the Salisbury Diocesan Church Building Society towards its construction. The foundation stone was laid by Mrs. Sarah Anne Rawlinson, wife of the rector, on 23 March 1865, in the presence of a large number of local clergy and residents. The stone was to have been laid by Mrs. Fooks of Mowerbury, but illness prevented her attendance, and her chosen replacement, Miss Legg of Allington was also unable to attend due to the death of a relative. Mr. William Gibbs of Bradpole was hired as the builder, with Mr. Richard Cornick of Bridport as the contractor, and Mr. W. K. Brown of Bridport handling the plumbing, glazing and woodwork. The completed church was consecrated on 25 April 1866 by the Bishop of Salisbury, the Right Rev. Walter Kerr Hamilton. Architecture St Paul's is built of local red sandstone sourced from Stoke Knapp, near Beaminster, with Hamstone used for the quoins and dressings, and slate on the roof. It was designed in the Early English style to accommodate 120 persons, and is made up of a nave and chancel. The west end contains the entrance, an oak door with ornamental ironwork, and a bell turret with a decorated cross finial. The arched braces of the open roof rest on corbels of Hamstone, and the chancel arch is also of the same material. The pulpit, lectern and reading desk are of oak, and the open seats of stained deal. The north and south sides of the building each have four lancet windows, filled with tinted cathedral glass. The east end has a three-lancet window, with three small circular windows above, and a single lancet window on each side of the chancel. The west end has a two-lancet window with circular and trefoil windows above. The east and west windows, and those on either side of the chancel, were gifted and painted by Mrs. Rawlinson.

The story follows a spy who has to \\"build a family\\" in order to execute a mission, not realizing that the girl he adopts as a daughter and the woman he agrees to be in a fake marriage with are a mind reader and an assassin respectively. It has been serialized biweekly for free on the Sh≈çnen Jump+ application and website since March 25, 2019, with the chapters collected and published into 5 tank≈çbon volumes by Shueisha as of September 2020. Viz Media has licensed the series for English release in North America. Characters =Forger family= ; :Loid is a spy who has extraordinary combat, memory, and information processing capabilities. He uses various faces and names for each mission, though he is generally known by his code name, \\"Twilight.\\" To be able to execute his current mission, he is required to have a child enrolled in a prestigious school where one of the admission qualifications is that \\"both parents are present,\\" hence he creates a fake family by adopting Anya and marrying Yor. He is skilled in cooking and cleaning. Formerly a war orphan, he became a spy in order to create a \\"world where children do not cry.\\" ; :Seen as a female employee at the Berlint City Hall, Yor is actually a skilled assassin nicknamed \\"Thorn Princess.\\" Yor's maiden name before marrying Loid is . She is 27 years old. Without knowing who Loid really is, and believing that Anya is Loid's actual daughter from a previous marriage, she agrees to a fake marriage so she will not appear suspicious. She has a younger brother named , who is a civil servant and is a bit too attached to her. ; :A young girl who can read the thoughts of other people, Anya is the only one who knows the overall situation of her family. She seems 4 or 5 years old, but she claims to be 6 so Loid will adopt her. Originally an experimental human test subject dubbed , she escaped because she was disgusted with a life where she could not behave like a child. Due to her ability, Anya is not good with crowds. In addition, because she has not received a proper education, she is not good with studying but makes up for it by reading other peoples' minds for answers, though it appears that she can't use her ability during a new moon. She likes spy anime and thinks anything involving \\"secrets\\" and \\"missions\\" are exciting. ; :The family's dog, Bond was originally Project Apple's canine test subject named \\"Subject 8\\". He has the ability to look into the future which was known and utilized only by Anya through her telepathy. He met Anya and the Forger family when he was used in a terrorist's bomb attack and then was adopted into the Forgers. He was named after Anya's favorite cartoon character, Bondman. =Others= ; :A cheeky classmate of Anya whose father is a someone with overwhelming authority, but that doesn't stop him from being a hard worker so his father would approve him. He appears as a tsundere who likes to bully Anya, not realizing that he has a crush on her. He has a dog named Max and two minions, Emille and Ewen. ; :Anya's best friend at school. Her father is a major military manufacturer. ; :Yor's 20 years old younger brother. Ostensibly a functionary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, this is just cover for his real position as a lieutenant of the State Security Service - where he is tasked with hunting down \\"Twilight\\". He is attached a bit too much to his sister, opposing Yor and Loid's marriage whilst not knowing who the latter really is. Production Tatsuya Endo and his editor Shihei Lin have known each other for over ten years; Lin was his initial editor on his first serial Tista (2007). When Lin was moved from the Jump Square editorial department to Sh≈çnen Jump+, Endo happily followed and they began developing a new work. Spy √ó Family takes elements from three of Endo's Jump Square one-shots; \\"Rengoku no Ashe\\", \\"Ishi ni Usubeni, Tetsu ni Hoshi\\" and \\"I Spy\\". Lin said that its reception among the editorial department was so good that serialization was practically decided before the official meeting was even held. Lin had Endo work as an assistant on Tatsuki Fujimoto's Fire Punch to gain experience. With Tista and Gekka Bijin both having a dark tone, Lin told Endo to give Spy √ó Family a more positive and cheerful one. The initial draft was given a working title of Spy Family written in Japanese. When deciding the final name, Endo came up with over 100 options, but they ultimately decided to use the same title but in English and with a \\"cross\\" in between, the latter influenced by Hunter √ó Hunter. The editor said that he and Endo are always conscious of the line where violence, which is necessary in a spy manga, is given a pass for comedy's sake. Anya was inspired by the main character of \\"Rengoku no Ashe\\". Her extrasensory perception was decided early on, and Lin cited its use for comedic effect as one of the series' strengths. Lin said that the series has a broad readership among all ages and genders. He also cited Endo's clean art and ability to convey emotions as part of the manga's appeal. Lin feels that the world and characters were firmly established as of volume two, and as such revealed that he and Endo would start to include longer narratives in the series. Publication Written and illustrated by Tetsuya Endo, Spy √ó Family has been serialized biweekly on the Sh≈çnen Jump+ application and website since March 25, 2019. The chapters, which are released every other Monday, have been collected and published into tank≈çbon volumes by Shueisha. Shueisha also simultaneously publishes the series in English for free on the Manga Plus app and website. Volume 4 was slated to be released on May 1, 2020 but was delayed until May 13, 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan.https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2020-04-09/demon-slayer-kimetsu- no-yaiba-other-jump-manga-delay-new-volumes-due-to-covid-19-coronavirus- concerns/.158441 Viz Media began publishing Spy √ó Family in English digitally on their website for free on September 22, 2019. They released the first volume in print in spring 2020. =Volume list= =Chapters not yet in tank≈çbon format= These chapters have yet to be published in a tank≈çbon volume. They were serialized on Sh≈çnen Jump+. *Mission: 31‚Äì35 *Short Mission 4  Reception  Spy √ó Family had 800,000 copies in circulation, including digital and physical sales, upon release of its second volume. This number exceeded 2 million with the release of volume three, and 3 million in circulation by volume four. The series took first place in the web manga category of the Tsugi ni Kuru Manga Awards 2019. In December 2019, Brutus magazine included Spy √ó Family on their \\"Most Dangerous Manga\\" list, which included works with the most \\"stimulating\\" and thought-provoking themes. Later that same month, Polygon included it on a list of the best comics of 2019. The 2020 edition of the Kono Manga ga Sugoi! guidebook named Spy √ó Family the best manga series for male readers. It came in first on Honya Club's Nationwide Bookstore Employees' Recommended Comics of 2020 list, compiled by surveying 1,100 professional bookstore employees in Japan. It also won the 4th Tsutaya Comic Taish≈ç in 2020. Spy √ó Family was nominated for the 13th Manga Taish≈ç, where it came in second place, the 44th Kodansha Manga Award, and the 24th Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize. In a positive review of the first 11 chapters, Antonio Mireles of The Fandom Post summed up Spy √ó Family as a great comedy about a dysfunctional family put into uncanny situations that never pan out as planned due to their unique personalities. He described the family setup of Loid as the straight man, Yor the \\"dumb character\\" and Anya the adorable child \\"that readers fall in love with,\\" as the perfect recipe for a comedy. However, he felt the humor that comes from Yor being the dumb character was underutilized. Comic Book Resources' Hannah Collins hailed the first volume as one of the best manga releases of 2020. She had strong praise for Endo's art; writing that \\"Action-comedy is no mean feat even in animated or live-action mediums. To pull it off so well in still images takes real artistic talent.\\" The reviewer called the artist's range of facial expressions his secret weapon, which he deploys to win over the hearts and minds of readers; particularity with those of Anya, whom Collins said, \\"steals every page she appears on.\\" Morgana Santilli of The Beat stated that Spy √ó Family volume one does an excellent job balancing fun espionage action with heartwarming family moments. She called Endo's art \\"clean and appealing\\", which makes his parody of post-war Berlin easily recognizable. Santilli compared its comedy to that of From Eroica with Love, another Cold War-centric series. In a review for Polygon, Julia Lee stated that Endo takes a premise that could make a \\"typical, corny, action manga\\" and uses it to make one of the funniest series out right now. Like the other reviewers, Lee praised Endo's art, writing that he has a knack for action scenes, as well as \\"expressive panels that really show you how the characters are feeling.\\"  References   External links  *Spy √ó Family at Shonen Jump+ *Spy √ó Family at Manga Plus * Category:2019 webcomic debuts Category:Action anime and manga Category:Comedy anime and manga Category:Espionage in anime and manga Category:Japanese webcomics Category:Sh≈çnen manga Category:Shueisha manga Category:Spy comics Category:Viz Media manga Category:Webcomics in print ","title":"Spy √ó Family"},{"id":"61862512","title":"Torres‚ÄìBanks languages"},{"id":"61862566","text":"The St. Mary's Abbey Figurine is a medieval gilt-copper alloy, Limoges enamel figurine found in St. Mary's Abbey, York in 1826.

The 298th episode overall of the series, it premiered on Comedy Central in the United States on September 25, 2019. The episode parodies ICE detention centers and the moral uncertainty surrounding the 2019 film Joker. Plot Randy Marsh leads a tourist group around his Tegridy Farms marijuana farm, showing how it has grown and expanded. As Eric Cartman complains to Stan Marsh about the changes in the farm, Randy notes that his orders have decreased. When he visits Stephen Stotch to personally deliver some marijuana, he discovers that Stephen and others in South Park have started to grow their own marijuana, and Randy promises to take action. Stan is forced by Randy to plead to the South Park city council to ban private marijuana farms, but the council rejects the suggestion, and Randy is angered to the point where he completely denounces all of South Park. Later, Randy is visited by representatives from MedMen and they agree to work together. Randy's partner Towelie is upset that Randy has decided to sell out to corporations and leaves in disgust. Cartman witnesses a group of ICE agents arresting Stephen's Hispanic worker and separating him from his family, and he is intrigued by the idea that ICE has the ability to separate families seemingly at will via an anonymous tip. Cartman makes a threatening call to Kyle Broflovski just as ICE agents raid the Broflovski home and split the family while Cartman happily watches. When Kyle arrives at an ICE detention center and the staff discover that he is Jewish, they realize that they must get Kyle out as soon as possible or risk being viewed as racist. As the ICE agents apologize to Kyle, he asks about the status of the other children in the camp, and warns them that the stress and anxiety on the children could lead to the possibility of one of them becoming a Mexican Joker. The agents begin to overreact to this and wonder which child in their camp is the Mexican Joker. Later, a new bus of children arrives at the camp, with Cartman among them. Cartman realizes that the detention center may remind Kyle of Nazi concentration camps and claims to feel sorry for his actions, as Kyle devises a plan to have everyone escape. A series of explosions throughout South Park destroys all of the private marijuana fields, an act for which the police immediately suspect Mexican Joker. Kyle has all of the detention center children fashion their aluminum foil blankets into yarmulkes to make them appear Jewish, in an attempt to get the agents to release them all, but the lead ICE agent believing he is experiencing a flashback to the origin of Mexican Joker, shoots and kills the other ICE agents and runs off in a panic. Randy celebrates the restored sales of Tegridy Farms products. Reception Chris Longo with Den of Geek rated the episode 2 out of 5 stars, summarizing his review by saying, \\"I feel like the wholesomeness of Tegridy has been ripped away from me. With all the bad in the world right now, why couldn't we just keep our Tegridy? Sigh. I don't have much hope for where this arc is going, but I'm a masochist and I'll be back next week.\\" John Hugar with The A.V. Club gave the episode a grade of \\"C+,\\" and stated in his review, \\"the episode ultimately tries to do too much at once, and feels awkward and disjointed. In previous serialized seasons, the show eased its way into each thread, often introducing them one episode at a time before resolving them all during the final stretch.\\" Laura Bradley of Vanity Fair concluded on a more positive critique, stating, \\"There is a rare spark of life in this premiere‚Äîof quiet, at-times-snarky conviction. This is South Park, so don't expect a feel- good moment or an earnest lecture anytime soon‚Äîbut it does seem that at last, South Park has found a way to do righteous anger its own way.\\" Alyse Wax of Collider gave both some positive and negative comments in her review, and stated, \\"Not a lot has changed with the show, other than it seems less outrageous nowadays. The social commentary has lost some of its bite as current events become closer to comedy. But this season, the social commentary is off to a better start than the last few seasons (such as the trolling or the election storylines).\\"  References  External links * Category:South Park (season 23) episodes Category:Works about immigration to the United States Category:American television episodes about cannabis Category:The Joker ","title":"Mexican Joker"},{"id":"61862646","text":"Basn√¶s is a manor house and estate located southeast of Sk√¶lsk√∏r, Slagelse Municipality, Denmark. The Gothic Revival style main building is a three- storey building with three corner towers designed by Gustav Friedrich Hetsch. The estate covers approximately 1,000 h4ectares of land. History The early history of the estate is unclear but the two small villages of Basnes and Nyb√∏lle were in the 14th century located at the site where Basn√¶s stands today. In 1366, Niels Pedersen pledged two farms in Basnes and two farms in Nyb√∏lle to Thure Knudsen. In 1400, the farms were acquired by the Busjios of Roskilde. In 1410 they were owned by abbot Matz in N√¶stved. In 1417, the farms in Nyb√∏lle were acquired by Jakobsen Lunge. Basn√¶s is first mentioned in 1426. After Jakobsen Lunge's death in 1428, Basn√¶s passed to his brother Ove Jakobsen Lunge. In 1451, he was succeeded by his son Thyge Lunge. Tyge Lunge's son-in-law, Jesper Krafse, inherited Basn√¶s in 1460. The estate then remained in the hands if the Krafse family for the next one hundred and fifty years. Margrethe Hansdatter Krafse, who had inherited the estate in 1602, was later married to Otto Brahe. They had no children and after their deaths Basn√¶s was therefore, in 1614, passed to her husband's sisters, Birgtte and Helvig Brahe. Helvig Brahe's share of the estate was in 1623 ceded to Henrik Wisch and shortly thereafter to Christian IV. Axel Arenfeldt In circa 1626, Basn√¶s was acquired by Axel Arenfeldt, who had already acquired the other share of the estate. The buildings had by then fallen unto neglect and Arenfeldt therefore began the construction of a new main building. He also increased the size of the estate to one of the largest on Zealand. After his death in 1647, Basn√¶s passed to his sons, Jakob and J√∏rgen Arenfeldt, and by 1676 it had passed to their relative Anna Ramel. In 1681, it was ceded to her brother, Ove Ramel. who once again increased the size of the estate through the acquisition of more land. Ove Ramel's widow, Mette Rosenkrantz, sold Basn√¶s in 1685. Jens Lowson by Nicolai Dajon, 1786 The new owner of Basn√¶s was Christian Bielke. Bielke omcreased the size of the estate even further and improved its management. His third wife, Vibeke Juel, who had become a widow in 1694, married Gregers Juel oin 1701 . He sold the estate in 1705. The new owner was Poul Eggers. In 1716, Basn√¶s was sold in public auction and the estate then changed hands 1q6 times over the next one hundred years. One of the owners, Jakob Lawson, converted Basn√¶s into a in 1777. The legal effect of a was that the estate could neither be sold, pledged or divided between heirs. Stamhuset Basn√¶s was, however, already dissolved in 1783. Basn√¶s in 1868 In 1809, Basn√¶s was acquired by Frederik Fiedler. His widow, Juliane Marie Sporon, kept the estate until her death in 1837. In 1838, Basn√¶s was acquired by Jacob Br√∏nnum Scavenius. His wife, Henriette, was the daughter of count Otto Joakim Moltke of nearby Espe (manor house) Espe Manor . The writer Hans Christian Andersen aften visited the family at Basn√¶s. He visited Basn√¶sapprozimately 37 times in the period 1855-1872, spending approximately 15 months on the estate. Henriette Scavenius kept the estate after her husband's death. Their son, Otto Jacob Br√∏nnum Scavenius, constructed a new main building. In 1907, Basn√¶s was acquired by count Eiler Moltke. In 1933, he sold the estate to De Forenede Cichoriet√∏rrerier A/S.

It consists of seven retail units or spaces historically occupied by individual tenants. The building is located at the corner of Peachtree Street, Peachtree Place and Crescent Avenue in the Midtown neighborhood of Atlanta, Georgia.File:CommRow-Hist Desig Nomination.pdf The building is today collectively numbered as 990 Peachtree Street, although the individual tenant spaces each have their own addresses, including 988 Peachtree Street, 90 Peachtree Place, and 92 Peachtree Place. Commercial Row was built at a time when retail and residential development were reaching northward towards what is today known as Midtown, from Downtown Atlanta. The building represents both the unique character of Atlanta's development northward along the city's main thoroughfare, Peachtree Street, as well as the establishment of distinct neighborhoods outside the city center in the 1920s. Over the years, tenants in the building have included grocers, restaurants and small retail stores. One of Atlanta's few remnants of that age of early development, Commercial Row sits on its original site and retains a high degree of structural integrity. As continuing commercial development removes traces of this earlier time of neighborhood community at the Tenth Street intersection, Commercial Row represents what the Peachtree Street corridor from Fifth to Fourteenth Streets looked like before massive redevelopment of the area in the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. The building was designated a City of Atlanta Historic Building Site in 2008. Currently it is owned by the Atlanta History Center and is operated as part of the Atlanta History Center Midtown, which also includes the Margaret Mitchell House. Part of the building is used for programs and exhibits, while other portions are leased to commercial tenants including a restaurant and a grocer.

Damu Amiri Imara Smith (1951 - May 5, 2006) was an American peace activist.  Early life and education  Damu Smith was born in 1951 in St. Louis, Missouri to Sylvester and Vernice Smith. His father was a firefighter and his mother was a licensed practical nurse. Smith was raised with his two brothers and sister in the Carr Square Village housing project. A working class family, they often struggled to make ends meet, sometimes receiving welfare or other government assistance. Smith has said that having this experience growing up developed in him a great sensitivity to the plight of low-income communities, and played a central role in shaping his views as an adult and as an activist. As a high school student, Smith had the chance to attend some of the Black Solidarity Day rallies in Cairo, Illinois, where he listened to speeches by Amiri Baraka, Nina Simone, and Jesse Jackson, and toured black neighborhoods where white supremacists had sprayed houses with gunfire, a sight that changed his life. As a freshman at St. John's University in Minnesota, and president of the Organization of Afro- American Students, Smith led a protest and takeover of the school‚Äôs administrative offices to demand a Black studies program. It was during that time that he changed his name to Damu Amiri Imara Smith, the first three words meaning ‚Äò‚Äòblood,‚Äô‚Äô ‚Äò‚Äòleadership,‚Äô‚Äô and ‚Äò‚Äòstrength‚Äô‚Äô in Swahili, respectively.  Career  Smith on Columbus Day 2002 at the Witness for Peace picket line near the White House. In 1973, Smith moved to Washington D.C., where he began the next chapter in his lifelong mission of advocating for social justice in the United States and abroad. He was one of the first African-American activists to fight environmental racism. Over the next thirty years, Smith's activism included vigilance in the fight against Apartheid in South Africa as Executive Director of the Washington Office on Africa and co-founder of Artists for a Free South Africa. Additionally, Smith focused his energy and attention on broad-based efforts to expose gun violence and police brutality, and was also active in peace and nuclear weapons freeze campaigns, working as the Associate Director of the Washington Office of the American Friends Service Committee. Smith spoke out against the U.S. invasion of Iraq in the 1990s during the Gulf War. Smith was known for his pioneering leadership in the environmental justice movement, working as the first environmental justice coordinator for the Southern Organizing Committee for Economic and Social Justice. After touring cities severely impacted by chemical pollution and seeing the devastating impacts of these practices on low income and African American communities, he organized Toxic Tours in the South for Greenpeace. In 1999, he coordinated the largest environmental justice conference ever held, an event which led to the formation of the National Black Environmental Justice Network, which was the first ever network of Black environmental justice activists, and of which he served as the Executive Director. He was the founder and executive director of Black Voices for Peace.  Personal life  March of Washington. Smith died on May 5, 2006 of colon cancer at George Washington University Hospital. He was survived by his companion Adeleke Foster, a daughter, sister, and two brothers.  Awards and honors  In 1986, Smith received the Malcolm X Community Service Award. He received the National Bar Association Community Service Award in 1989. The Southern Christian Leadership Conference presented Smith with an award in 1996 and in 1998, he received the St. James Citizen for Jobs and the Environment Award.

Biography Hart graduated from MIT with a bachelor's degree in geology in 1956 and a master's degree in geochemistry in 1957 from Caltech. In 1960 he received his doctorate in geochemistry from MIT with thesis Mineral ages and metamorphism under the supervision of Patrick M. Hurley. After a year as a Carnegie Fellow, Hart was from 1961 to 1975 at the Carnegie Institution in Washington, D.C. in the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism. From 1975 to 1989 he was a professor of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences at MIT and from 1989 to 1992 a visiting professor there. From 1989 to 2007 he was a Senior Scientist in geology and geophysics at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. He retired from Woods Hole in 2007 as Scientist Emeritus. Hart is a leading pioneer in the introduction of geochemistry into the Earth sciences. He developed comparative geochronology, which accounts for geological perturbations in various geochronometers. At the Carnegie Institution of Washington, he worked with George Wetherill, George Tilton, L. T. Aldrich, and G. L. Davis on mapping Precambrian rocks in the USA using comparative geochronology. There Hart became the leader of a group including Thomas Krogh, Albrecht Hofmann, Christopher Brooks, and others. According to Claude All√®gre: Hart focused on the application of isotopic chemistry to age determination in geology, the geochemical evolution of mantle and oceanic lithosphere, and the geochemistry of strontium, neodymium, and lead isotopes in volcanic rocks. He also studied the long-term behavior of the chemical composition of the oceans due to their interaction with the oceanic crust and the experimental determination of fundamental geochemical properties such as mineral-melt partition coefficients in silicates and solid-state diffusion rates. In 1968, together with John S. Steinhart, he published the Steinhart-Hart equation, which provides a mathematical model of how the temperature and the electrical resistance of a thermistor vary, based upon 3 so-called Steinhart-Hart coefficients.John S. Steinhart, Stanley R. Hart, Calibration curves for thermistors, Deep-Sea Research and Oceanographic Abstracts, Volume 15, Issue 4, August 1968, Pages 497‚Äì503, ISSN 0011-7471, . He was a co-editor from 1970 to 1972 of the Reviews of Geophysics, from 1970 to 1976 of the Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta, and from 1975 to 1992 of Physics of the Earth and Planetary Interiors. In 1975/76 he chaired the US National Committee for Geochemistry. His doctoral students include Erik Hauri. Hart has three children, one daughter from his first marriage, which ended in divorce in 1978, and a son and a daughter from his second marriage which began in 1980.

She works on electrochemistry and the development of nanomaterials for sustainable energy and sensing applications. She has demonstrated a metal oxide perovskite that can be used as the air and fuel electrode in solid oxide fuel cells, as well as creating nanoporous carbon scaffolds to be used in batteries and capacitors.  Early life and education  Birss grew up in Crowsnest Pass, Alberta. She moved to Calgary at the age of five. When she was deciding what to study at college she felt that physics was \\"too abstract\\", and biology \\"too descriptive\\", so settled on chemistry. Having grown up with the wilderness close to her home, Birss was always aware of the environment, and interested in identifying clean ways of storing, converting and using energy. This attracted her to materials science and electrochemistry. Birss earned her doctorate at the University of Auckland as a Commonwealth Scholar, where she studied anodic films on silver electrodes. She was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Ottawa, where she worked on the supercapacitive properties of hydrous metal oxides. During this post she specialised in Ruthenium(IV) oxide.  Research and career  Birss began her independent career at Alcan International, where she developed new techniques to evaluate the susceptibility of aluminium alloys to stress corrosion and pitting. Her efforts resulted in the creation of a high-strength corrision resistant alloy; Al-Mg-Si alloy. She moved to the University of Calgary in 1983 and was promoted to Full Professor in 1991. Birss studies nanomaterials for a range of different applications, including fuel cells, batteries, capacitors and sensors. She is also interested in catalysis and drug sensing. In 2002 she was a founder of the Western Canada Fuel Cell Initiative, which included over 35 research groups at eight institutions. This was supported by $2 million of funding under Birss' leadership. She subsequently founded the pan-Canadian Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Canada, an umbrella organisation for groups working on solid oxide fuel cells. Her work has focused on understanding and modifying the electrochemical, chemical, physical and morphological properties of thin films on electrode surfaces. This has involved the development of redox-active metal oxides. Birss became a Tier 1 Canada Research Chair in Fuel Cells at the University of Calgary in 2004. The majority of her efforts have focussed on solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) and proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), carbon materials and biological sensing. Her main contributions have been to the identification of the kinetics and mechanisms of oxidation and reduction in fuel cells using electrochemical methods, as well as developing new fuel cell materials. She has improved the performance and lifetime of low temperature PEMFCs through the development of carbon scaffolds. For high temperature SOFCs Birss has developed metal oxide perovskite catalysts that can be used as both the anode and cathode, allowing for carbon dioxide and water splitting. She has worked with Honeywell on electrodeposition of metal coatings to enhance their protection. She has since served as Co-Director of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council Strategic Research Network, which distributes $5.5 million funding across 16 research groups. = Awards and honours = Her awards and honours include; * 1985 Electrochemical Society W.

Biography  Jamie was grandson of Elizabeth Sutherland, 24th Countess of Sutherland on his father's side and Harold Balfour, 1st Baron Balfour of Inchrye on his mother's. His Great Uncle was disgraced Conservative politician John Profumo. Educated at Eton College, he rejected his privileged background and worked as a volunteer in refugee camps all over Europe and the Middle East, including the Calais Jungle where he taught English. Jamie wrote a number of articles about his experience working on the refugee trail. He also spent some years as a film maker, producing videos for activist organisations including the Green Party of England and Wales, Object, NO2ID and others. He also wrote and directed a number of short films and pilot episode of comedy series called 'Be Well', based in a therapy clinic. Jamie joined the YPG after spending time working in Mosul, distributing medical aid and clean water. What he saw there moved him to take the next step and travel to Syria to join the Kurds to defend Rojava against ISIS. He fought in the liberation of Raqqa, then in January 2017, when Turkey invaded the Kurdish town of Afrin, just over the Syrian border, Jamie decided to stay with the YPG to fight this new threat, despite knowing that fighting a NATO ally could cause problems if he wanted to return to Europe. Jamie appeared in a number of YPG propaganda videos, including one condemning what he perceived to be Western inaction during the Turkish-led Afrin offensive. as well as being interviewed for numerous print articles and on the BBC. Interviews with Jamie also feature heavily in the BBC documentary \\"Anna, the woman who went to fight ISIS\\", about the British YPJ fighter, Anna Campbell who died in the Afrin assault. Upon his return to the UK in 2018, he was arrested in Kent under section 5 of the Terrorism Act. He was still under investigation at the time of his death, although no former YPG volunteers have been successfully prosecuted by the British government. Jamie died on 4 September 2019, taking his own life after a long struggle with mental illness.

It takes place in the Lands of Dream and follows an Irishman's voyage down a river flanked by fantastical cities. It was published in the short story collections A Dreamer's Tales (1910) and Tales of Three Hemispheres (1919). Sidney Sime illustrated the story with two images. Dunsany wrote two sequel stories, both published in 1912. H. P. Lovecraft took inspiration from \\"Idle Days on the Yann\\" for several of his stories.  Background  Like many of Dunsany's early works, \\"Idle Days on the Yann\\" is set in a dreamworld where the descriptions recall Arabia, Greece, North Africa and India. In his autobiography Patches of Sunlight (1938), Dunsany explained the background to this setting as a combination of Biblical readings, an interest in Greco-Roman antiquity, having briefly seen Tangier at the turn of the century, stories about Egypt his father had told him, the impact of Rudyard Kipling's fiction at a young age, and experiences from South Africa during the Second Boer War. \\"Idle Days on the Yann\\" in particular was written in anticipation for a trip down the Nile.  Plot summary  At the River Yann, the nameless protagonist embarks on the ship Bird of the River to travel to Bar-Wul-Yann: the Gate of Yann. He says he is from Ireland, and the sailors mock him because no such place exists in the land of dreams. When everybody on board pray to their gods, the protagonist chooses the obscure and abandoned god Sheol Nugganoth. The ship makes stops at the cities Mandaroon, where the citizens sleep to prevent the gods from dying and dreaming to end, and Astahahn, where citizens use ancient rituals to prevent Time from slaying the gods. In Perd√≥ndaris, a merchant buys the captain's cargo of toomarund carpets and smokable tollub. The protagonist is impressed by Perd√≥ndaris, but discovers a huge ivory gate made of one solid piece, and returns to the ship terrified. A couple of days later, they stop at Nen, the last city on the river. Nen is crowded with Wanderers, a strange singing and dancing tribe that descends from the mountains once every seven years. The ship finally reaches the Gate of Yann: two narrow, mountain-high, smooth and pink marble cliffs that the river flows between into the sea. Departing, the protagonist knows he will not meet the captain again, because his fancy is growing weaker.  Reception  The Gate of Yann, illustration by Sidney Sime W. B. Yeats wrote: \\"Had I read 'The Fall of Babbulkund' or 'Idle Days on the Yann' when I was a boy, I had perhaps been changed for better or worse, and looked to that first reading as the creation of my world; for when we are young the less circumstantial, the further from common life a book is, the more does it touch our hearts and make us dream. We are idle, unhappy, exorbiant, and like the young Blake admit no city beautiful that is not paved with gold and silver.\\"  Legacy  Dunsany wrote two sequels to the story: \\"The Shop in Go-by Street\\" and \\"The Avenger of Perd√≥ndaris\\". Both were first published in 1912 and included, together with the original story, in Tales of Three Hemispheres (1919). In the sequels, the same narrator tries to return to the Lands of Dream to revisit the crew of the Bird of the River, but has trouble doing so. The stories further explore Dunsany's conception of poetic imagination as an intermediary between the ordinary world and the lands of myths and dreams, as well as the view that all these worlds are illusions. The surface plot of H. P. Lovecraft's 1919 short story \\"The White Ship\\" is modeled on \\"Idle Days on the Yann\\". Unlike Dunsany, Lovecraft made his tale allegorical and included philosophical themes. Lovecraft's \\"The Cats of Ulthar\\" (1920) also features a tribe called the Wanderers, with similarities to the one in \\"Idle Days on the Yann\\". Further, Robert M. Price has argued that the name of Lovecraft's fictional deity Shub- Niggurath is likely to have been inspired by Sheol Nugganoth in Dunsany's story. Jorge Luis Borges included \\"Idle Days on the Yann\\" in his Library of Babel.

Zhongshan Kingdom or Zhongshan Principality () was a kingdom of the Han dynasty, located in present-day southern Hebei province. The kingdom was carved out of Changshan Commandery in 154 BC and granted to Liu Sheng, son of the reigning Emperor Jing. In 55 BC, the last Prince of Zhongshan in Liu Sheng's lineage died without issue, and the kingdom was abolished.Book of Han, Chapter 53. In 46 BC, however, the territory was granted to Liu Jing, son of Emperor Xuan, as his fief. Jing also left no issue, and the kingdom was subsequently granted to Liu Xing (ÂäâËàà), son of Emperor Yuan. In 1 BC, Liu Kan, the heir to the Zhongshan Kingdom, was enthroned as Emperor Ping, and Liu Chengdu (ÂäâÊàêÈÉΩ), another member of the imperial family, became the new Prince of Zhongshan. He was deposed after Wang Mang's usurpation.Book of Han, Chapter 80. After the restoration of Eastern Han, the kingdom was reestablished. It was initially awarded to Liu Mao (ÂäâËåÇ), one of Emperor Guangwu's fellow rebels against Wang Mang.Book of Later Han, Chapter 1. Later, Mao was demoted to the rank of marquis, and the territory went to Liu Fu (ÂäâËºî), the emperor's second son. Fu was moved to Pei soon later, and his brother Liu Yan (ÂäâÁÑâ) succeeded him as the Prince of Zhongshan. Yan's lineage held Zhongshan until the year 174, when the last prince died without issue. Zhongshan was subsequently converted to a commandery.Book of Later Han, Chapter 42. In late Western Han, it administered 14 counties: Lunu (ÁõßÂ•¥), Beiping (ÂåóÂπ≥), Beixincheng (ÂåóÊñ∞Êàê), Tang (Âîê), Shenze (Ê∑±Êæ§), Kuxing (Ëã¶Èôò), Anguo (ÂÆâÂúã), Quni (Êõ≤ÈÄÜ), Wangdu (ÊúõÈÉΩ), Xinshi (Êñ∞Â∏Ç), Xinchu (Êñ∞Ëôï), Wuji (ÊØãÊ•µ), Lucheng (Èô∏Êàê) and Anxian (ÂÆâÈö™). The total population in 2 AD was 668,080, or 160,873 households.Book of Han, Chapter 28. Zhongshan again became a kingdom/principality in the Cao Wei and Western Jin dynasties.

Murphy Shouts at Player-Owner Meeting.\\" The Harvard Crimson Created by Robert Murphy, a Harvard-educated labor lawyer from Boston, it failed to take root when Murphy could not convince a two-thirds majority of the Pittsburgh Pirates' active players to strike before a National League game on June 7, 1946.Spink, J. G. Taylor, editor (1947): \\"Guild Movement Nipped in Bud.\\" The Sporting News: The 1947 Official Baseball Guide and Record Book, page 199 That summer, MLB owners ‚Äî also shaken by the Mexican League raids that lured a handful of American players to \\"jump\\" their contracts for higher salaries in Mexico ‚Äî made minor concessions to players and the Guild perished. It was the fourth and last unsuccessful attempt to unionize big-league players before the formation of the Major League Baseball Players Association, founded in 1953 and recognized as their official bargaining unit in 1966. Background The post-World War II era was a tumultuous period for baseball. In , the first full season after the war ended in August 1945, many players who had been serving in the military resumed, or tried to resume, their pre-war baseball careers, creating a surplus of playing talent, and necessitating a temporary expansion of teams' playing rosters: instead of the normal 25-man quota, teams were permitted to carry 36 players before June 15, and 30 thereafter.Treder, Steve, \\"1946: Major League Baseball's 1491.\\" Fangraphs.com: The Hardball Times Attendance would nearly double from 1945's wartime totals, reversing a period of declining turnstile counts that had begun with the advent of The Great Depression in 1930 and kicking off a four-year \\"baseball boom\\" in both the majors and in minor league baseball.\\"Baseball in 1946: It's Good to be Home.\\" ThisGreatGame.com But player salaries remained stagnant.Rossi, John P. (1999), A Whole New Game: Off-the-Field Changes in Baseball, 1946‚Äì1960. Jefferson, NC, and London: McFarland & Co., . Pages 8‚Äì10 The sudden surplus of players and the expanded rosters simultaneously depressed individual salaries and inflated the payrolls of the 16 clubs. In addition, the impact and duration of the attendance spike could not be foreseen, and several MLB teams (such as the Chicago White Sox, Philadelphia Athletics and Washington Senators) were still owned by budget- constrained former players or their families who had no income sources outside their turnstile receipts. Furthermore, the reserve clause in the standard player contract perpetually bound signees to their respective teams. Capitalizing on this situation, the Mexican League, operating outside the \\"Organized Baseball\\" sphere and dominated by Jorge Pasquel, its president and most powerful club owner, convinced 18 MLB players to abandon their teams to play in Mexico for higher wages. Some of the exiles, such as Brooklyn Dodgers catcher Mickey Owen and undefeated St. Louis Cardinals starting pitcher Max Lanier, were considered top-flight players; moreover, Pasquel set his sights on future Baseball Hall of Famers Joe DiMaggio, Bob Feller, Stan MusialAppel, Marty (15 May 2014), \\"Mexican League Raids and the Temptation of Stan Musial.\\" Society for American Baseball Research and Ted Williams, and MLB stars like hard-hitting St. Louis Browns shortstop Vern Stephens. Outside baseball, labor disputes broke out in multiple industries, resulting in a wave of strikes. Prominent among these job actions were walkouts by steel and coal workers in Pittsburgh early in 1946. Formation of the Guild This confluence of events led Murphy, a former examiner for the National Labor Relations Board, to form the American Baseball Guild on April 14, 1946, saying: \\"I could talk for three days on some of the injustices done to ballplayers by the club owners.\\" He began to approach players from the 16 major league teams about joining the Guild, whose six immediate goals were: *Players whose contracts are sold from team to team should receive 50 percent of the purchase price *Players may take salary disputes and other grievances to arbitration *Owners may not institute a maximum salary *A minimum salary of $7,500 per year should be established *Contracts may not be ‚Äúone-sided‚Äù *Provisions should be made for bonuses and insurance. The reference to \\"one-sided\\" contracts was an early shot across the reserve clause's bow; however, Murphy declined to make a frontal assault on the provision because he feared \\"over-reaching.\\" Wrote The Harvard Crimson in August 1946: \\"[Murphy] doesn't believe that the much discussed reserve clause can be completely done away with without benefiting the more affluent clubs. Murphy does not feel, however, that the contract, in its present form, would stand up in a court of law, since it is completely one-sided, binding a player to one team for life, while the club must give him only ten days notice before releasing him.\\" Failed strike vote Murphy focused on the Pittsburgh Pirates, who played in a union stronghold, as his initial organizing target. His early efforts seemed to point towards success when, according to The Sporting News 1947 Baseball Guide & Record Book, 95 percent of the Pirates' playing roster took out Guild cards. However, after an initial meeting, Murphy attempted unsuccessfully to bargain with Pirates' president William Benswanger, who was in the process of selling the family-owned team. Benswanger pled with his players to put off bargaining with ownership until the end of the 1946 season. In response, Murphy called for a strike vote on Friday, June 7, when the Pirates were scheduled to play a night game at Forbes Field against the New York Giants. The Guild needed a two-thirds supermajority (24 of the 36 Pittsburgh players voting yes) to authorize the strike. But in a lengthy players-only meeting before the Giants' game, support for the Guild collapsed in the face of the forceful opposition of pitcher Rip Sewell and infielder Jimmy Brown. The strike authorization received 20 yes votes, still a majority, but short by four men of the required 67 percent mandate and indicative of a fatal erosion of the union's early-season strength. The Pirates ignored Murphy as they exited their clubhouse and took the field, where they handily defeated their opponents, 10‚Äì5. Said third baseman Lee Handley: \\"We played a dirty trick on Murphy. We let him down, and I was one of those who did it.\\" Fans in the stands, many of them trade union members, booed the home side for repudiating the Guild. Aftermath The defeat of the strike vote in Pittsburgh dealt the Guild a death blow. Less than two months later, major league owners offered concessions to players: a minimum salary of $5,500, the beginnings of a pension plan, the ability for one elected player representative from each league to appear before them to discuss issues and grievances, and a spring training per diem the players nicknamed \\"Murphy Money.\\" Murphy decried the formation of what he called a \\"company union\\", but by the end of the year, the Guild would pass out of existence and Murphy would pass out of public life, saying that the players, having gratefully taken an \\"apple\\" from MLB owners, \\"could have had an orchard.\\" Murphy was able to appeal the June 7 matter before the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board, but when the Pirates were polled again on August 20, they voted 15‚Äì3 against the Guild, with one ballot invalidated and 12 abstentions. Following the formation of the MLBPA and its 1966 recognition as the players' collective bargaining representative, the first successful players' strike occurred during spring training in . A second strike shortened the regular season. The reserve clause, famously challenged by former Cardinals' outfielder Curt Flood in 1970, would survive the Guild by almost three decades until a December 1975 arbitrator's ruling dismantled it and ushered in the era of free agency in Major League Baseball. Since then, MLB experienced lengthy players' strikes in 1981 and 1994‚Äì1995. See also *The Brotherhood of Professional Base-Ball Players *Major League Baseball Players Association *Flood v.

A contributor to the clandestine paper Frit Danmark, she assisted key resistance members who worked underground. Arrested by the Gestapo in September 1944, she escaped from the Fr√∏slev Prison Camp in April 1945, shortly before the Liberation of Denmark. Early life Born on 16 June 1909 in Copenhagen, Kate Fleron was the daughter of Waldemar Frederik Ferdinand Fleron Jacobsen (1869‚Äì1934) and Nonny Margrethe Bauditz (1885‚Äì1957). She was brought up in a well-to-do home in the Frederiksberg district of Copenhagen where her parents allowed her considerable independence. Following in the footsteps of her maternal grandfather, the editor Ferdinand Bauditz, she decided from an early age that she would become a journalist. Career On matriculating from Marie Kruse's School in 1928, she became an apprentice with Nordsj√¶llands Venstreblad in Hiller√∏d. In 1930, she joined the conservative paper Nationaltidende where she remained until 1942 when she was forced to leave for making unacceptable editorial changes. Working as a freelance journalist, she was successful in having her articles published in magazines. She published two books about young people, Afsporet Ungdom (1943) and Vi er Ungdommen (1943), presenting controversial views on sex and morals. In December 1942, she was contacted by Ole Kiilerich, an earlier colleague who worked on the clandestine paper Frit Danmark (Free Denmark) Founded the previous April, it had become one of the country's leading anti-German publications. As several of those working on the paper had already been arrested and Kiilerich feared the same fate, he asked Fleron to take his place as a conservative contributor. Her work consisted of assembling information and writing articles but, under the codename Fr√∏ken Krog, her duties soon extended to coordinating resistance members and parachuting groups. In spring 1944, she began editing Frit Danmark's weekly news sheet while she also published her book 29. August 1943. Arrested by the Gestapo in September 1944, she escaped from the Fr√∏slev Prison Camp in April 1945, shortly before the Liberation of Denmark. After the end of the occupation, she became a member of the Liberation Movement's Council which had replaced the Freedom Council. In 1945, she published the book Kvinder i Modstandskampen (Women in the Resistance Movement), underlining the important role women had played. She continued to edit Frit Danmark until it closed in 1982. Her political views veered from conservative to left wing. Fleron was also active in the movement against the Vietnam War. In 1972, she received the PH-Prize for her anti-war activities. Kate Fleron died on 5 March 2006 and is buried in Frederiksberg √Üldre Kirkeg√•rd.

It is about northwest of the village of Godbout on the north shore of the Estuary of Saint Lawrence. The forest is administered by Quebec ªs Ministry of Natural Resources, Wildlife and Parks, Forest Environment Directorate. It was designated old-growth forest in 2003, and has IUCN management category III. The forest has an area of . The terrain is moderately rugged, with tall hills covered by thin glacial till and many rocky escarpments. The forest is on the southern slope of a steep hill looking over the Rat Musqu√© Lake and the Little Godbout River (Petite rivi√®re Godbout). A map of the Ecological regions of Quebec places the Gobout area in ecological region 5g Hautes collines de Baie- Comeau ‚Äî Sept-√éles in the eastern fir/white birch domain of the boreal zone. Flora The Petite-Rivi√®re-Godbout Old Forest is made up of a few stands dominated by northern white-cedar (Thuja occidentalis), which is rare in the C√¥te-Nord. Usually cedars are found in areas of deciduous and mixed forest. Dry cedar groves growing on rock are even rarer. Other trees are balsam fir (Abies balsamea), black spruce (Picea mariana) and white birch (Betula papyrifera). The forest has never been developed or disturbed by human activities, and for a long time has not suffered from severe natural disturbances such as fire, high winds or insect infestations. The older cedar trees are 300 to 400 years old. The trunks of the dominant trees have an average diameter of and height of , while the mature fir stands surrounding the forest are no more than high. The regeneration stratum of the forest contains a good proportion of cedars, balsam fir and white birch, so the cedars seem well established. Due to their strength and longevity the cedars should continue to dominate the upper strata of the forest. Shrubs include mountain maple (Acer spicatum) and Canada yew (Taxus canadensis). In some places the yews are very abundant. The herbaceous layer includes mountain woodsorrel (Oxalis montana), shining firmoss (Huperzia lucidula), Canadian bunchberry (Cornus canadensis), threeleaf goldthread (Coptis trifolia), starflower (Trientalis borealis), spinulose woodfern (Dryopteris carthusiana) and blue-bead lily (Clintonia borealis).

Al-Azimi was a poet and school master in Aleppo. He was a contemporary of the Aleppine historians Hamdan ibn Abd al-Rahim al-Atharibi and Ali ibn Abdu-illah ibn Abi Jarada. He belonged to the Tanukhid tribe. Al-Azimi authored a general annals of history of Syria beginning from the year 1063 and ending 1143/44 called Al Muwassal 'ala al-Asl al-Mu'assal. This work was published by Claude Cahen as La Chronique abr√©g√©e d'al- øA·∫ìƒ´mƒ´ in the French Journal asiatique in 1938. Al-Azimi also composed the influential Ta'rikh Halab (The History of Aleppo), which was a frequent source for the later histories of Aleppo by Ibn al-Adim and Ibn Abi Tayyi. According to Cahen, > The interest of the portions of al-'Azimi's work which have been preserved > does not reside in their intrinsic value, but rather in the fact that they > are the only texts which escaped the destruction of North Syrian > historiography between the middle of the 5th/9th century and that of the > 6th/12th century; they thus enable us, to a certain extent, to complete or > criticise the great works of the following century, on which we are > dependent for the history of this period, by bringing us closer to their > sources: a necessary test in view of the changes which had taken place in > the meantime in the Syrian moral and social climate. Most of al-Azimi's work have been lost, with the exception of the portions published by Cahen. According to the Syrian historian Suhayl Zakkar, despite what little survives, the information al-Azimi provides is \\"very valuable\\" for the history of Aleppo in the 11th century. Part of his work covers the reigns of the Mirdasid princes of Aleppo Shibl al-Dawla Nasr, Mu'izz al-Dawla Thimal and Rashid al-Dawla Mahmud, their relations with the Fatimid Caliphate, the collapse of the dynasty, the rise of the first Seljuk ruler of Aleppo Aq Sunqur al-Hajib, and the era of the Zengids.

Davy paints and draws in the style of social realism and portraiture, recognizable for his keen sense of light and color depicting both the human and non-human.  Early life and education  Davy was born and raised in New York, New York. Davy spent his early years fine tuning his technique at a summertime apprenticeship at the mural studio his father owned alongside highly trained Russian and Chinese social realist academic style painters. Davy notes that he helped paint the clouds visible on the ceiling of the New York Public Library before he began college. Davy attended and graduated from the School of Visual Arts where they now teach.  Work  Davy paints a range of subject matter including portraits of friends and beachgoers, candlelight scenes, horses and ponies, and wildlife, typically highlighting the subject matter's interaction with light and shadows. \\"Light is the great connector in my art, and it has both symbolic and metaphysical values. \\"Sol Invictus.\\" Indeed, it is the apriori pattern of our visual and symbolic systems. It is also the source of life, becoming in the leaves of grass,\\" the artist says in an interview with CF Hill. Davy's 2014 solo exhibition, \\"Candela,\\" at the gallery 11R featured a series of intimately-scaled paintings of life-size candle flames. In 2017, Davy debuted several small-scale and large-scale realistic paintings of horses at the downtown Manhattan gallery, 11R. The exhibition, titled \\"Horses,\\" was inspired by an old photograph the artist found which read ‚Äú195 Chrystie Street, 1880‚Äù that belonged to his great-great-great-grandfather. From the photograph, Davy learned that the gallery was located at the same space where his great-great-great grandfather's livery stable once stood. The sentimental and erotically charged paintings took more than two years to complete and have stylistically been compared to the Dutch old masters. \\"This Marram,\\" an exhibition of over 100 unframed studies in pastel and gouache, was presented at Van Doren Waxter gallery in late 2019. The exhibition showcased intimate scenes from the artist‚Äôs own life on Fire Island and included sketches of friends, fellow artists and writers, and drawings of his husband, Liam, alongside flora and fauna of the island. Davy's subjects for the show included the playwright Jeremy O. Harris, artist K8 Hardy, editor and critic David Velasco, painter Doron Langberg, jeweler Edgar Mosa, photographer Wolfgang Tillmans, writer Andrew Durbin, amongst others. Davy is a frequent musical collaborator with artist Morgan Bassichis. Along with DonChristian Jones, Michi Osato, and Una Osato, Bassichis and Davy have several produced musical iterations of The Faggots & Their Friends Between Revolutions a radical literary faggotry written by Larry Mitchell in 1977.

The essay parodies people who are enthusiastic fans of autumn and has become a cultural touchstone. Yearly, the piece goes viral at the beginning of autumn in the Northern Hemisphere and has spawned parodies and spin-offs.  Essay  =Creation= Nissan, who is a self-proclaimed fan of autumn, pitched the essay to McSweeney's Internet Tendency in 2009. At first, Nissan was unsure about the profanity-heavy piece. However, with the help of the McSweeney's editor, Nissan narrowed down the curse words used to just using the term \\"fuck\\" and modified the ending making the essay funnier and more positive. =Synopsis= The piece is written from the point of view of a person who is overly obsessed with autumn. The narrator, feeling the change of the season, wants to engage in a number of stereotypical autumnal activities such as placing \\"shellacked vegetables\\" into a wicker cornucopia to make a centerpiece for a table. The piece both parodies and celebrates autumn and the people who are enthusiastic about the season by highlighting contradictions between the \\"Genteel, white, upper class, rural or suburban\\" world of people popularly conceived as to be fans of autumn and decorative gourds, and the \\"gritty, expletive-filled diatribe of excess\\" presented by the essay.  Impact  When the essay was released, it garnered one million views in several days. As of 2019, ten years after its publication, the essay is McSweeney's Internet Tendencys second-most-read piece. Every year since its publication at the start of autumn in the Northern Hemisphere, the piece goes viral on social media. At least a dozen monologues of readers performing the essay have been posted to YouTube. Nissan was not paid for the essay and receives no royalties from the piece's yearly popularity. However, he does receive royalties from the mug that McSweeney's made with a quote from the essay. Nissan enjoys the notoriety that comes from writing a piece of perennial viral content and thinks it \\"is much more than I could ever have gotten from a residual\\". The essay has been referred to as \\"the fall season's most iconic essay\\" by Randall Colburn of The A.V. Club. The piece has become an ode to autumn and has spawned spin-offs such as \\"It's Scorpio season, motherfuckers\\". Martha Stewart has referenced the piece claiming that decorative gourds season is not overrated.

The Law of Uppland became the law of the land, not only for the province of Uppland it created, containing the three Folklands and Roden, but also for G√§strikland. The law contained eight law codes: The Church, King's, Heritance, Freeman's, Land, Merchant's, Neighborhood, and Thing codes. Courts were held in each Hundred and each Folkland. There were no public prosecutors, and no material difference between criminal and civil cases existed. Suits in law would be initiated by the parties. Legal proceedings were of three kinds: trial by eyewitnesses, trial by compurgation and trial by jury. Background In early medieval Sweden, each Land (province), were judicially autonomous with its own legal system, laws and justice (leges terre). The law originally only existed in a spoken form, recited at the Thing by the Lawspeaker. From the end of the 13th century, the oral laws began on private initiative to be recorded in the form of unofficial law texts (Rechtsb√ºcher). From the Law of Uppland, however, the law codes were formally enacted.Liedgren 1980-1982, col. 231-232. Creation The area of Uppland, which did not exist before the enactment of the Law of Uppland, contained the three Folklands of Tiundaland, Attundaland, and Fj√§rdhundraland.Lundberg 1980-1982, col. 320-321. The Lawspeaker of Tiundaland, Birger Persson (the father of Saint Bridget) complained to King Birger Magnusson, that the law for the three Folklands were scattered in several different law texts, some of them obscure and sometimes very difficult to comply with. Hence the King appointed Birger chairman of a Royal commission that would draft a new law; removing some provisions, adding some, and merging the old laws of the three folklands into one.Lundberg 1980-1982a, col. 332. According to the preamble of the Law, in addition to Birger, the commission came to consist of from Tiundaland, the Dean of Uppsala Master Andreas And (Birger's cousin), the Knights Herr R√∂d Keldorsson and Herr Bengt Bosson, Ulf Lagmansson, Hagbard of S√∂derby, Anders of Forkarby and Torsten of Sandbro; from Attundaland the Knight Herr Filip R√∂de of Rundby, H√•kan Lawspeaker, Eskil the Cross-eyed, Sigurd Judge and Jon G√•sabog; from Fj√§rdhundraland Ulv of √ñnsta, G√∂trik and Ulvheden, Judges. The commission made a draft that was subsequently enacted by the Things of the three Folklands, and finally given Royal assent eight days after Saint Stephen's Day (January 2), 1296.Lagerbring 1773, pp. 657-659. Jurisdiction thumbThe jurisdiction of the Law of Uppland. The Law of Uppland, became the law of the land, not only for the province of Uppland it created, containing the three Folklands and Roden, but also for G√§strikland. Since the new law of the whole realm, the Magnus Erikssons landslag of 1350, lacked a church code due to opposition from the Church, the church codes of the several provincial laws remained in force even after 1350. Gradually the church code of the Law of Uppland became valid for the whole kingdom, remaining in force until it was partly replaced by the Church Act of 1686 and finally by stipulations in the Civil Code of 1734.Strandberg 1980-1982, col. 684. Formal content The Church code governed the relationship between the Church, the Bishop, the Priest, the Parish, and the People, including marriage, baptism, and tithe. The King's code covered the election of Kings, and the relationship between the King and the People. It contained provisions concerning the People's obligation to the King, such as leidang, watch and ward, and taxes, as well as the King's obligation to uphold the Peace. The Heritance code governed inheritance and bequests; the Freeman's code was the nearest equivalent of a criminal code, aimed at protecting the Freemen from abuse. The Land code included clauses about birthright to land, property owned in common, and maintenance of the elderly. The Merchant code regulated purchase of gold, women's right of purchase, hospitality and foraging, as well as a prohibition against selling Christians. The Neighborhood code regulated division of land, metes and bounds, commons, new land, mills, dams and bridges, hunting, fishing, cattle and more. The Thing code included provisions about trials and lawsuits, as well as of the Law of the land and of the law of Roden. Eighteen amendments were later added to the law, including stipulations about burial fees, outlawry, deeding of land, and homicide by unknown perpetrators. Courts and procedures A Thing could be held as often as every week in each hundred, or in each Skiplagh (ship's districtHafstr√∂m 1980-1982, col. 472.) in Roden. The judgments were given by the judge, not the assembly. There would be two judges for each thing, although only one served at the time. The judges were elected by a jury of twelve men appointed by King's Lensmann, and thereafter commissioned by the King. Each Folkland also had a thing, under the Lawspeaker of Uppland. A common landsting for all of Uppland did not exist. Appeals from the Hundred thing would go to the Lawspeaker; from the Lawspeaker to the King.Holmb√§ck & Wess√©n 1933, pp. xxxviii-xxxix. There were no public prosecutors, and no material difference between criminal and civil cases existed. Suits in law would be initiated by the parties. A perpetrator caught in flagrante delicto would be taken as a prisoner to the Thing by the plaintiff; in other cases the plaintiff would serve a summons on the defendant. In cases of acts that could be atoned for by mulcts, the defendant could also initiate action by offering such at the Thing.Holmb√§ck & Wess√©n 1933, p. xxxix. Legal proceedings were of three kinds: trial by eyewitnesses, trial by compurgation and trial by jury. If the plaintiff could bring, in most cases, six sworn free and freeborn men as eyewitnesses, the case was closed, and now further action from the defendant would be allowed; he was convicted. But if the plaintiff could not produce enough sworn witnesses, the defendant had the right to establish his nonliability by taking an oath and having, normally, eighteen men swear that they believed him. If the required number of men took the oath, he was acquitted, otherwise he was convicted. The use of jury trials is not guided by any clear legal principles, but through individual provisions in various parts of the law. A new jury (n√¶fnd W√ºhrer 1980-1982, col. 440.) would be selected for each new case. In trials concerning the King's Peace, the jurors had to be approved by both parties. In some other cases half the jury was selected by each party. The jurors took an oath on their verdict; if they refused to give a verdict, they were fined.Holmb√§ck & Wess√©n 1933, pp. xxxix-xliii.

First intended as a website and support network for survivors of sexual assault, it has expanded its scope into first a sexual health clinic and then other projects such as a maternity clinic, a photography project and various workshops. Foundation Having survived a sexual assault in her teens, Pavan Amara realised in her twenties she was having trouble accessing healthcare and when she spoke to other women she realised many people had issues resulting from trauma. She therefore decided to set up the My Body Back Project in August 2014. She intended it to provide a website which could be useful for survivors of sexual assault and also a support network. She also wanted it to help medical professionals help survivors better. My Body Back became a group which would provide healthcare and also sex and relationship support groups aimed specifically at women and trans people who have survived sexual assault. It is a non-profit organisation. Amara wanted to provide physical and practical resources. Clinic After one year, the project set up a clinic intended for survivors of sexual assault. It was the first of its kind in the world. The clinic was funded by the National Health Service (NHS) and located at St Bartholomew's Hospital in London. The clinic provided testing for sexually transmitted infections, cervical screening and birth control advice. The clinic opened a branch in Glasgow in 2018. The project was funded by the Scottish Government. It was to be run by NHS doctors, nurses, counsellors, administrators and volunteers from Rape Crisis Scotland who had been trained by members of the London clinic. Maternity clinic Having heard from women that they would like to have a maternity clinic set up exclusively for survivors of sexual assault, My Body Back set up the UK's first such clinic in 2016 together with Barts Health NHS Trust. It was established at the Royal London Hospital. Amara commented that \\"a number of the women told me how isolated they felt throughout pregnancy and labour and how it had triggered them into remembering their experience of being raped.\\" Women at the clinic could attend antenatal classes, have gynaecological examinations, and receive psychological support from trained staff, such as midwives, pediatricians and psychologists. The users also had access to self-test kits to avoid being touched. This was helpful since sometimes women being examined were being unintentionally put into positions or situations which brought back the trauma of assault. Amara runs the clinic alongside gynaecologist and obstetrician Dr Rehan Khan and consultant midwife Inderjeet Kaur. On the topic of why nobody had set up such a clinic before, Amara commented \\"I really don't think it's the fault of health workers, because everybody's been wonderful helping me do this.\\" Other projects My Body Back began a photography project with photographer Rankin in 2016, focused upon aiding women recover from sexual assault. Rankin took extreme close-up shots of temporary tattoos on the women's skin which gave messages of strength and solidarity such as 'Nobody is entitled to my body but me'. Rankin commented \\"I was truly moved by this project and humbled to be involved. The sheer strength of these women, after what they have been through, left me speechless.\\" 'Notes of Love' was a project in which people write anonymous messages to survivors of sexual assault, which are then distributed by Rape Crisis England and Wales. Amara invited students from 20 universities to participate in the project. Another project was Caf√© V, a regular Saturday morning meeting in a sex shop in Shoreditch, East London, where women could discuss how to enjoy sexual intercourse again after experiencing rape. The caf√© was trans-inclusive. The Clit List is a pornography resource for survivors of sexual assault. It aims to provide detailed reviews of pornographic films, so that people can decide if they want to watch them or not without triggering.

It is regarded as an indicator species for polar water.  Description  Fragilariopsis cylindrus is a unicellular, eukaryotic, microalgae that is important due to its ecological roles. This is because it is major contributor to climate change processes, responsible for 20% global carbon fixation, and forms a substantial basis of the marine food web, making up 40% of marine primary productivity. F. cylindrus is found native to the Southern Ocean, with their proximal side valve mantle being 1.6 Œºm, their girdle 0.75Œºm, apical axis ranging between 15.5Œºm to 55.0Œºm, transapical axis ranging from 2.4Œºm to 4.0Œºm, and their transapcial axis ranging from 2.4Œºm to 4.Œºm. Their transapical striae count is 10-16, with a mean of 10Œºm, while their row of poroids range from 50 to 56, in 10Œºm. F. cylindrus typically forms large populations in the bottom layer of sea ice, as well as in the wider sea-ice zone, which includes open waters. It is known for its ability to survive temperatures below 0¬∞C, high salinity, the semi-enclosed pore systems within the ice, as well as low diffusion rates of dissolved gases and exchange of inorganic nutrients that occur within their environment. F. cylindrus is a phototropic organism, but is able to sustain essential metabolic processes in the dark, ensuring rapid recovery upon re-illumination, and allowing them to survive long-term darkness. Gram stain, cellulose activity, growth rate, motility and the microbe's ability to resist/produce antibiotics have are unknown at this moment.

Life and work Born Ida Margaret Graves to Rt Rev Charles Graves and Selina Cheyne on 28 December 1859. Her father was Dean in the Chapel Royal in Dublin Castle and Poore grew up between there and their home in Parknasilla, Kerry until her father became Bishop of Limerick. Poore was sister of Alfred Perceval Graves, and aunt of poet Robert Graves. Poore was sent to a preparatory school for young ladies in Fulham, England. For her secondary level education she was first put under the care of a governess at home, which was then in Blarney, Cork. Poore was then sent to Fanny Metcalfe's school in Highfield where she was a classmate of Blanche Athena Clough. On her return to Kerry, Poore acted as her father's secretary in the aftermath of the Disestablishment of the Church of Ireland. There were also various guests of the family including Sheridan Le Fanu's brother William. Due to her father's health at various times he traveled Europe and Algeria and took her with him. She also traveled in Egypt which was where she met her future husband. Her biography gives a fascinating insight into the history of the countries where she and her family were living. She tells the story of the anti-catholic riots in Alexandria and the results of the shelling of the city by the British forces. Poore married Sir Richard Poore, 4th Baronet on 14 September 1885. They had one son, Roger. He followed his father into the Navy and was killed in action in 1915. Richard Poore rose to the position of Admiral in the Navy. Poore wrote two autobiographical books on life as a woman and as the wife of an admiral. She was known as Flag Mother to the sailors who worked with her husband. From 1908 to 1911 she and her husband were assigned to Sydney, Australia where Lady Poore was the first president of the Bush Book Club. She died on 5 February 1941 in Switzerland.

Over 800,000 individuals die by suicide every year. For every suicide, 6-10 people grieve their deaths. Individuals experiencing suicide bereavement experience different challenges than those otherwise bereaved. Across 41 studies that examined these differences, the suicide bereaved experienced higher levels of blaming, stigma, shame and rejection. Those who lose someone to suicide may experience delays in the healing process.  Complicated grief  Complicated grief is grief whose symptoms do not decline over time. 10%-20% of individuals survivors develop complicated grief. Individuals who develop complicated grief are likely to experience physical impairments to their daily functioning, with accompanying suffering. These symptoms persist without proper treatment, which became Complicated Grief Treatment.  Grief stages  Elisabeth K√ºbler-Ross, a Swiss-American psychiatrist, developed a model that encapsulates five stages of grief that an individual is likely to experience after a loss: #Denial: Can help the individual minimize the overwhelming pain of loss. This stage allows the individual to slow the processing of painful imagery, potentially reducing the pain. #Anger: The individual adjusts to their new reality while likely experiencing extreme emotional discomfort. Anger tends to be the first feeling the individual experiences when they realize that their emotions are related to their loss. #Bargaining: In this stage, the individual attempts to negotiate with a higher power. #Depression: During the grieving process, bargaining has failed and the individual faces the facts of their loss. They are more likely to internalize their feelings and experience extreme sadness. They may find it difficult to reach out to others and experience isolation. #Acceptance: In this last stage, the individual no longer resists the reality of their situation, leaving mostly sadness and regret.  Suicide risk  Compared to other bereaved, the suicide bereaved are at a higher risk of experiencing suicidal ideation. According to a 2002 study, results showed that suicide bereaved individuals were 1.6 times more likely to experience thoughts of suicide, 2.9 times more likely to have a suicide plan, and 3.7 times more likely to have made a suicide attempt. These individuals may conclude that suicide is the only viable solution to their pain. Other suicide bereaved may want to feel closer to the person they lost by ending their life the same way their loved one did.  Stigma  Despite efforts to de-stigmatize suicide, unlike other types of death, suicide remains stigmatized. Individuals who have lost their loved ones to suicide have reported difficulty with talking to others about their loss due to feeling uncomfortable talking about the topic. Additionally, certain religions reject those who have committed suicide. The suicide bereaved individuals may feel shame, making them uncomfortable sharing their loss in their religious group. Insurance policies may exclude death benefits for suicides. Survivors of suicide often experience difficulty healing due to this stigma.  Treatment  = Support groups = Support groups can be beneficial for the suicide bereaved, because this is a nonthreatening place where they can experience catharsis among others in a similar situation. Homogeneous support groups are typically more helpful than broader bereavement support groups. Such groups offer reassurances that feelings are acceptable. Individuals also may receive coping recommendations for holidays, talking to others and other now-difficult situations. Support groups can be found by visiting the International Association for Suicide Bereavement (IASP) website, which is affiliated with the World Health Organization. The American Association of Suicidology (AAS) and the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP) also has a list of 400+ support groups across the United States. = Psychotherapy = Support groups on their own may not help individuals who develop a mental illness, such as Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) or Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The suicide bereaved are encouraged to seek clinicians who specialize in psychotherapy and/or medication management. A combination of education, psychotherapy and medication have been shown to be the most effective treatments. = Complicated grief treatment = Complicated grief treatment (CGT) incorporates elements of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), exposure and motivational interviewing. This type of psychotherapy facilitates the essential process of accepting loss. The combination of exposure techniques with cognitive restructuring has been shown to help individuals experience life satisfaction and engage in meaningful relationships.

His Scanian estates was then confiscated and presented to Field Marshall Conrad Marderfelt. Negotiations for the return of his estates and his appointment to landsh√∏vding of Blekinge and Ramel and four other Danish noblemen were in 1678 executed in effigie on the central marketplace in Malm√∂. During the war, Ramel served first as General War Commissioner in ]Kristianstad and from 1678 as county governor]9 of Helsingborg. He did not take advantage of the amnesty that followed the Peace of Lund but settled in Denmark where he was granted title of etatsr√•d. He was, by marriage, the proprietor of Lergrav. In 1551 he ceded Lergrav to his sister, Anna, the widow of chancellor Peder Reedtz, in exchange for Basn√¶s on Zealand. In 1682, he also acquired Borreby Castle. Ramel died on 29 January 1685 at Borreby and was buried at Sor√∏ Abbey Church. Borreby had to be sold as a result of his financial situation. The king granted his widow a pension of 500 daler as compensation for the loss of their Scanian holdings. She sold Basn√¶s in 1685.

De Martini, and his colleagues Pablo Ortiz, Peter Negron, Carlos da Costa, worked in offices on the 88th floor of the North Tower of the complex, the first tower to be struck in the attacks. Martini and his coworkers had all arrived early and were sharing a coffee with De Martini's wife when an American Airlines Flight 11, which had been hijacked by terrorists, struck their building just a few floors above them at 8:46 A.M. The men helped clear the entrance to one of the buildings three stairwells, and directed their fellow occupants to descend to safety. De Martini assured his wife he would follow her. But the four men then proceeded to find and rescue dozens of people. They ascended to the 89th floor, and bashed through the drywall, next to the blocked door, allowing the occupants of that floor to escape. When the building was hit all the elevators stopped. Passengers in those elevators had to be rescued by workers from the outside, and the four men proceeded to execute those rescues. It has been estimated that at least 50 people survived the attack due to the rescue efforts of De Martini and his colleagues. When they arrived on the 89th floor De Martini directed Mak Hanna to carry an elderly man, who could not descend 89 floors, down to safety. De Martini, Ortiz, Negron and da Costa all perished when the North Tower collapsed at 10:28 A.M. Hanna was the only one of their crew to survive.

Born in Ontario in 1887, she graduated from Prescott High School and then married in 1904. Her husband quickly abandoned her, leaving her a single mother. Moving to Montreal in 1906, she began working as a stenographer in the law office of Samuel William Jacobs, who encouraged her to study law. Finding no barriers to her admission, Langstaff enrolled at McGill University in 1911, graduating three years later as a Bachelor of Civil Law. On applying to the Bar of Montreal to practice, she was refused the right to take the examination. When Langstaff petitioned the Superior Court for a Writ Of Mandamus to compel the bar to admit her as she met all statutory requirements, the court upheld the bar's decision based upon the fact that she neither had her husband's permission to attend law school, nor to become a lawyer. As her husband had abandoned her and her child and she did not know where he was, she was unable to obtain his permission. The refusal led to feminists in support of women's suffrage embracing Langstaff and her cause. She became active in the fight for enfranchisement of women in Quebec, while continuing her fight to become a barrister. In 1915 she filed an appeal with the Court of King's Bench, which also ruled against her, claiming that her recourse was to petition the legislature, since they had enacted the statute defining who could become a lawyer. Langstaff was supported in her quest by her employer, with whom she would work for 60 years. Preparing an amendment to the Bar Act, Jacobs argued for the admission of women to the bar before the National Assembly of Quebec in 1915. Numerous attempts were made to change the law, without success. She wrote Canada's first French-English/English-French law dictionary in 1937. In 1940, when women in Quebec won the right to vote, the decision was used as leverage to change the law excluding women from practicing law. The next year, joined by Leona Bell and Elizabeth C. Monk, Langstaff pleaded with the Quebec Bar Association to support their right to practice. The bar agreed to allow women to enter the profession, if the legislature approved, which they did on 29 April 1941. Because of a prerequisite for lawyers admitted to the bar to have obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree, Langstaff was not admitted to the bar in her lifetime. She was posthumously admitted to the Montreal Bar in 2006. Early life Annie MacDonald was born on 6 June 1887 in Alexandria, Glengarry Township, Ontario, to Clara Angela ( McPhaul) and Archibald B. MacDonald. Her father was a teacher, later an insurance agent, and both of her parents were Catholic. Annie was the oldest sibling in a family of five other children: John, Alice Phyllis Muriel \\"Phyllis\\", Mary Jane, Pearl and Eileen. By 1891, the family was living in Prescott, where MacDonald attended Catholic grammar schools and graduated from Prescott High School. On 21 November 1904 in Prescott, MacDonald married Gilbert Samuel Langstaff, a carpenter, with whom she had a daughter, Mary Andrea Langstaff, on 28 April 1906. Soon after their marriage, Langstaff and her husband separated, as he left her. Her husband migrated to New York City in 1905 with another woman whom he claimed to have married in 1904. Career =Law school and bar case (1906‚Äì1915)= Samuel William Jacobs, in 1918 In 1906, Langstaff moved to Montreal, Quebec, to work for the law firm of Jacobs, Hall and Garneau, as a stenographer for the head partner Samuel William Jacobs, . Her family also moved to Quebec, where her father worked as a customs collector in Saint-Hyacinthe. Langstaff had an affinity for the law and within a few years was performing much of the company incorporation work for Jacobs. With his encouragement, she wrote to McGill University's Faculty of Law, in 1911, inquiring if she could be admitted. Frederick P. Walton, dean of the faculty, responded that no woman had ever asked for admission before, and while he was unsure of whether his colleagues would approve, she ought to begin attending lectures. Langstaff graduated in 1914 with a Bachelor of Civil Law, first in her class in criminal and company law, and fourth overall with first-class honours. That year, she became the first woman to serve as a court stenographer in the June Special Session of the Montreal Criminal Court. Langstaff applied to sit for the preliminary bar examination but was refused by the Bar of Montreal despite her law degree. The preliminary examination was open to male students before they began their studies, but anticipating that she might encounter difficulty, Langstaff had not applied until after she had already received her degree. In January 1915, she petitioned the Superior Court for a Writ Of Mandamus. With Jacobs acting as her counsellor, she asked the court to grant her the right to take the examination, as she met all the statutory qualifications. At issue were two questions: whether a woman was admissible at all, and whether as a married woman, Langstaff was admissible as either a law student or lawyer, since her husband had not given his consent. A good deal of the court proceedings focused on the fact that Langstaff was raising her daughter as a single mother and did not know the whereabouts of her husband. In his ruling, Justice Henri- C√©saire Saint-Pierre denied her request, stating that to allow her to practice law without her husband's consent would be a \\"direct infringement upon public order and a manifest violation of the law of good morals and public decency\\". Justice Henri-C√©saire Saint-Pierre After Saint-Pierre's comments had been widely publicized in newspapers throughout the United States and Canada, the issue became a cause c√©l√®bre for those involved in the struggle for women's suffrage. Professor Carrie Derick and the () staged demonstrations protesting the decision. Langstaff was invited regularly to speak at suffragist rallies, where she stressed that equal opportunity was her goal and filed an appeal with the Court of King's Bench. At the September 1915 hearing, the court's focus was again turned to the facts that she was not living with her husband, that he had not agreed to her attending law school, and that she was raising her daughter without his support. In a 4 to 1 decision, issued on 2 November with Justice Joseph Lavergne as Langstaff's sole supporter, her appeal was denied. The basis of the ruling was that the intent of the law in Quebec was to exclude women from the legal profession because hearing cases which involved crimes of a sexual nature or obscenities \\"would bring into contempt her honor as a spouse or as a mother and to revile herself in the eyes of her husband, her children, and the male sex generally\\". The judge also noted that the courts were not the appropriate venue for such a decision and that it should be reviewed by the legislature since the law forbade women practicing. On 31 December 1915, her only brother was killed in action while fighting on the front lines in World War I. =Continuing activism, paralegal work, and legal scholarship (1916‚Äì1965)= Langstaff began to plan for introducing an amendment to the Bar Act at the next legislative session of the National Assembly of Quebec, which would convene on 12 January 1916. Langstaff's supporters, including Jacobs, prepared a bill and Lucien Cannon sponsored it. Jacobs, using arguments supporting Langstaff's application written by Justice Lavergne, spoke to the committee along with feminists Grace Ritchie England and Marie Lacoste G√©rin-Lajoie. The bill did not make it out of committee, nor did a similar attempt made after the 1916 General Election of Quebec. Langstaff continued to work as a legal assistant at Jacobs, Hall, Couture and Fitch, (later Jacobs & Phillips (1920) and still later Phillips & Vineberg (1945)). During World War I, further action on admitting women to the bar in Quebec was suspended, but in 1920 another unsuccessful attempt at legislation was made. Becoming the assistant to the other senior partner, Senator Lazarus Phillips, Langstaff served as his secretary, a bookkeeper for the firm, and as a paralegal. In 1921, Langstaff took up flying. An article published on 1 July 1922 in Maclean's Magazine called her the \\"first Canadian woman to fly\\" and featured her photograph. That year, when French general Ferdinand Foch toured Montreal, she circled the city in a plane as part of the festivities. She continued to attend and speak at suffragist meetings and rallies. In 1929, she proposed that single women refuse to marry until the civil code which treated wives as chattel was revised. In 1930, the legislature was again pressed to admit women to the bar. The debate clarified that the bar no longer objected to the admission of women and would allow a judge to grant her permission in the absence of a spouse. After two days of arguments, once again, the proposed bill was defeated by a vote of 37 to 29, largely because Antonin Galipeault, the Minister of Public Works and Labour, tied it to a pending suffrage bill and the possibility that feminists would next be asking for the possibility of divorce. The following year, another bill was submitted but was defeated by two votes. In 1935, when Joseph-Napol√©on Francoeur introduced legislation for women to prove their need for employment before they could work, Langstaff became a vocal opponent. She argued that employment was a human right and if men could work in women's occupations, like fashion or cooking, then women should be allowed to work in whatever field they wanted. She suggested that if professional men had sufficient income without employment, perhaps they should give up their careers to unemployed men. The bill did not pass, as most Members of Parliament felt that it violated the right to work. In 1937, Langstaff published the French-English, English-French Law Dictionary, the first Canadian legal dictionary to provide terms found in the Civil, Criminal and Municipal Codes in English and French languages. She authored several articles on family law and continued her work in business law, drafting bylaws and incorporation papers for groups like the Montreal branch of the National Council of Jewish Women of Canada. In 1939, she was one of the featured aviators in an air show held in Montreal in honor of King George VI and heir presumptive, Elizabeth. After having 13 suffrage bills defeated between 1922 and 1939, Quebec's feminists worked that year to convince Premier Ad√©lard Godbout to keep his campaign promise to reintroduce the measure. On 9 April 1940, he personally introduced \\"Bill No. 18\\" proposing women's suffrage at the provincial level. The bill passed with a vote of 67 in favour and 9 against on the third reading on 18 April. Gaining approval on 25 April from the Legislative Council, feminists saw the vote as leverage to gain other reforms. The following year, Langstaff, Leona Bell (wife of Leslie Bell) and Elizabeth C. Monk submitted a plea asking support for women's right to practice law to the Quebec Bar Association. In a vote of 12 in favour and 11 against, the bar agreed to allow it as long as the legislature approved a bill in the sitting session. On 29 April 1941, the legislature passed the bill and in early 1942, Monk, Constance G. Short, and Marcelle Hemond were the first women admitted to the bar. Impacting Langstaff, the new law required that candidates have a Bachelor of Arts degree for admission to the bar and she was not prepared to study for another degree. Langstaff retired in 1965, having spent six decades at Phillips & Vineberg. Death and legacy Langstaff died on 29 June 1975 in Montreal, after a lengthy illness, and was buried at Cornwall, Ontario. Her papers were collected by her daughter and placed in the archival holdings of the Faculty of Law at McGill University. In 1988, McGill's Faculty of Law inaugurated the Annie MacDonald Langstaff Workshops in her honour to provide a forum for academics, judges, lawyers, and community activists to present scholarly research and practical insights on issues relating to women and the law. Two other named lectures, the Margot E. Halpenny Memorial Lecture and the Patricia Allen Memorial Lecture are given each year as part of the series, in addition to three or four additional presentations. In 2006, more than 90 years after she had first been refused admission to the bar, Langstaff was posthumously admitted to the Barreau de Montr√©al and awarded the bar's rarely- given Medal of Honour. As by that time, her daughter, who had become a nun in the Sisters of Holy Cross, had already died, the medal was accepted by Davies Ward Phillips & Vineberg, the successor firm to her former employer. It later went on display at McGill University Faculty of Law.

It is located on the side of a hill called Bric San Nazario and is easily visible in the countryside thanks to its tall bell tower and the chromatic effect due to the alternating stripes of bricks and sandstone. It is an important example of the Romanesque architecture of Montferrat. It was founded in around 1130 on the site of a previous settlement called Mairano, which was later abandoned in the 13th century. People moved to Montechiaro, which is about 2 km far, and the church went on a slow decline. In 1847 the building was close to collapse, so it was heavily renovated: the whole church was dismantled except the fa√ßade, all the bricks and stones were numbered and catalogued and it was accurately rebuilt, following a process called anastylosis. Other minor restoration processes were carried out in the following centuries.

For several decades, he has practiced surgery and has published five novels. His main subjects are children's pain, the struggle against disease and the trauma resulting from situations on the edge of life. He has contributed to the development of image-guided mini invasive surgery.  Biography  Patrick Froehlich has been a surgeon. He has lived in Lyon, Brussels, and some time ago settled in Montreal. He is the author of five novels. He began by publishing numerous scientific articles and works in the area of airway pediatric surgery of the respiratory system. He contributed to the development of imagery-guided, low-invasive surgery. He practiced medicine at the CHU in Lyon as a university professor and hospital practitioner until 2017 and, from 2009 to 2014, as full professor attached to the University of Montreal. Recently, he wrote two books for Les Allusifs publishing house (Montreal). These are fictions that spring from real situations: the pain that children suffer, the fight against sickness, the effects of situations encountered by surgeons at life's far extremes. The novel Avant tout ne pas nuire (First, Do No Harm), a work halfway between fiction and documentary, is, according to the leading French newspaper Le Monde, an exercise in introspection undertaken by Froehlich in relation to the theme of pain, the pain he feels as well as that inflicted upon the child in the course of surgery. He explains that his own awareness was long in coming, and reminds us that the newborn's ability to experience pain was not recognized until 1987. The novel begins with his daughter asking this question: ‚ÄúHave you ever hurt a child? Tell me you never hurt a child you were taking care of.‚Äù Patrick Froehlich answered No, though ‚Äúpoorly articulated, scarcely audible,‚Äù and he points out that ‚Äúthis inability to assert the contrary‚Äù concealed ‚Äúa sense of shame‚Äù that he was forced to confront. In the novel Ce c√¥t√© et l‚Äôautre de l‚Äôoc√©an (Both Sides of the Ocean), again, we read in Le Monde, the author ponders the question of pattern repetition. He suffered from his parents continually moving when he was young, and wonders if he hasn't reproduced the same pattern with his own children by taking on different positions in Belgium and Canada. Le Monde writes, ‚ÄúWe follow him, recovering hidden memory, rediscovering the city of Poughkeepsie, in the Hudson Valley, where his father worked for IBM, attracted by the myth of America and the great computer utopia of the 1970s. Gazing into the mirror streaked with parental and personal fears, the writer is less after revelation, and more interested in stripping away and moving beyond.‚Äù He talks about his writing process and what he learned from composing these two novels on his site. ‚ÄúAs a result of the conflicts that shook the generations that came before me (the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, World War I and II, the Algerian War), I began to write about my own war against sickness. First by considering pain in Avant tout ne pas nuire, then through my father and the Algerian colonial war in Ce c√¥t√© et l‚Äôautre de l‚Äôoc√©an. This book led me to take on the surgeon‚Äôs traumatic memory in a more direct manner, facing the fact of writing in a more unexpected way. The two works are independent, they stand on their own, though they do open onto each other. I end each work by discovering what the next one will be, where my writing will go next. ‚ÄúWriting begins with inner tension. The fear of the subject, and the shame associated with it are excellent motivators. The story begins with my reality, but it is much richer and more complex than my imagination.‚Äù  Bibliography  = Books = *La minute bleue (A blue moment), Corps √©trangers - III (Foreign bodies - III), Montreal: Les Allusifs, 2020. *Ce c√¥t√© et l'autre de l'oc√©an (Both Sides of the Ocean), Corps √©trangers - II (Foreign Bodies - II), Montreal: Les Allusifs, 2018. *Avant tout ne pas nuire (First, Do not Harm), Corps √©trangers - I (Foreign Bodies - I), Montreal: Les Allusifs, 2017. * L'Enfant secou√© (The shaken child), Paris: Publie.net, 2018 [2011]. * La Voix de Paola (Paola's Voice), Paris: Publie.net, 2018 [2009]. *Le Toison, Paris: Le Seuil, Fiction & Cie, 2006. * Les Infections ORL de l'enfant (Infections in Otolaryngology), Paris: Larousse Guides sant√©, 2005. = Articles (selection) = * Gilles Roger, MD, Patrice Tran Ba Huy, MD, Patrick Froehlich, MD, PhD, et al., \\"Exclusively Endoscopic Removal of Juvenile Nasopharyngeal Angiofibroma Trends and Limits\\", Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 2002;128(8):928-935. * Ana Nusa Naiman MD, Philippe Ceruse MD, Bruno Coulombeau MD, Patrick Froehlich MD, \\"Intralesional Cidofovir and Surgical Excision for Laryngeal Papillomatosis\\", The Laryngoscope, 2003 Dec;113(12): 2174-81. * Carine Fuchsmann, MD; Marie-Claude Quintal, MD; Chantal Giguere, MD; Sonia Ayari-Khalfallah, MD; Laurent Guibaud, MD, PhD; Julie Powell, MD; Catherine McCone, MD; Patrick Froehlich, MD, PhD, \\"Propranolol as First-line Treatment of Head and Neck Hemangiomas\\", Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 2011;137(5):471-478.

He is the author of multiple books including Infiltration: The Plot to Destroy the Church from Within, published in 2019.  Education  Marshall graduated from Texas A&M; University in 1999 with a degree in philosophy. After studying at Westminster Theological Seminary and Nashotah House, Marshall was ordained a priest of the Episcopal Church. Shortly thereafter, in 2006, he and his wife converted to Catholicism. In 2011, Marshall earned his Ph.D. in Philosophy at University of Dallas.  Career  From January 2012 until June 2013, Marshall served as the chancellor of the now-defunct College of Saints John Fisher & Thomas More. Prior to his administrative work at the college, he was a professor of philosophy. Marshall also formerly served as the assistant director of the Archdiocese of Washington's Catholic Information Center. He is a founder of the New Saint Thomas Institute, an online Catholic theology educational program, and the Troops of Saint George, a Catholic scouting organization. Marshall has published books in the fields of theology, philosophy, and historical fiction. The vast majority of these books have been published by Saint John Press and Media, a company held and managed by Marshall. He actively promotes traditionalist Catholicism through his various websites, blog posts, podcasts, and YouTube videos. Guests on his platforms have included Michael Voris, Alexander Tschugguel, and Faith Goldy. Marshall has been openly critical of Bishop Robert Barron's promotion of the Balthasarian thesis of the possibility of universal salvation. His 2019 book, Infiltration, claims to demonstrate that, over the last two centuries, the Catholic Church has been systematically infiltrated by modernist and secular humanist ideology. The foreword of the book was written by Bishop Athanasius Schneider. The book has been controversial in Catholic circles, drawing both positive and negative reviews. In an interview, Archbishop Carlo Vigan√≤ spoke positively of the book's central thesis. In October 2019, Marshall received media attention for publicizing an incident at the Catholic Church's Amazon Synod in which Tschugguel and an accomplice filmed themselves removing indigenous fertility statues, reportedly of Pachamama, from the Church of Santa Maria in Traspontina in Rome and throwing them into the Tiber river. In March 2020, it was revealed that Marshall himself had personally funded Tschuggeul's trip to Rome and uploaded the video of the theft.  Personal life  Marshall met his wife, Joy, in 1999. They were married on June 9, 2001 at Saint Andrew's Episcopal Church in Fort Worth, Texas. They have eight children. Marshall and his family converted from Anglicanism to Catholicism in May 2006, receiving the Sacrament of Confirmation from Bishop Kevin Vann. He is a parishioner at Mater Dei Catholic Church in Dallas, which is run by the Priestly Fraternity of Saint Peter.

Carthew worked in East Dereham for most his life, and published several works on the history of town and its church. George Alfred Carthew (20 June 1807 ‚Äì 21 October 1882) was an English antiquarian, local historian, and genealogist, though he worked as a solicitor for most of his life. Early life and legal career George Alfred Carthew was born on 20 June 1807, in Redenhall with Harleston, Norfolk, to the solicitor George Carthew (1777‚Äì1861) and his wife Anne (1785‚Äì1858), daughter of Peter Isaack of Wighton. His family could trace its lineage back to St Issey, Cornwall, where they resided until Thomas Carthew (Carthew's great- grandfather) inherited Benacre Hall in Suffolk in the early-18th-century. He grew up as the eldest of three sons, and rarely attended school, owing to his family's financial hardships, instead working as an apprentice in his father's office. Here he was allowed to access a large collection of genealogical documents in his father's collection, which instilled in him \\"the remarkable faculty for genealogical and historical research which he exhibited throughout a long life\\", according to Gordon Goodwin of the Dictionary of National Biography (DNB). One particular collection was a stack of charters from Mendham Priory, Suffolk, which he spent several years deciphering, transcribing, and analysing. Carthew mastered their contents to such a degree that, as a 29-year-old man, in 1837, he correctly addressed several errors in their interpretation, in a letter to the senior antiquarian John Adey Repton, published in The Gentleman's Magazine. In 1830, Carthew qualified as a solicitor, after working in Framlingham for nine years. He continued his partnership with his father while in Harleston, after which he accepted a partnership in East Dereham, where he worked for the rest of his life. Antiquarian career Inspired by his early work with his father's charters, Carthew was a passionate antiquarian throughout his life. He and his father were early members of the Norfolk and Norwich Archaeological Society, and Carthew became on of the first local secretaries of the organisation. Carthew was a frequent contributor to the society's journal, Norfolk Archaeology, publishing, among other papers, an article on East Dereham church in the first volume, and extracts from the antiquarian Peter Le Neve's diary (which had passed through his family after Thomas Martin of Palgrave, husband of Le Neve's widow, had gifted it to his grandfather) accompanied by his extensive genealogical notes. Goodwin lists Carthew's most important contributions as \\"On the Right of Wardship and the Ceremony of Homage and Fealty in the Feudal Times\\" (Norfolk Archaeology. 4: 286‚Äì91) and \\"North Creake Abbey\\" (Norfolk Archaeology. 7: 153‚Äì68). In February 1854, Carthew was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London, and often contributed to its periodicals. Upon George Henry Dashwood's death in 1869, Carthew was one of the antiquarians responsible for bringing his first volume of William Hervy's 1563 Visitation of Norfolk to publication in 1878. After his death, two unfinished works of his were prepared for publications by his close friend, Augustus Jessopp: A History of the Parishes of West and East Bradenham (1883) and The Origin of Family or Sur-Names (1883). Carthew's primary antiquarian work was his The Hundred of Launditch and Deanery of Brisley in the County of Norfolk, published in three parts between 1877 and 1879, near the end of his life. This work was the product of forty years of work, hindered by his poor health and financial hardships. The publication of the work was costly for Carthew, as it was only privately circulated, but it met with much praise from local historians. Walter Rye in his Index to Norfolk Topography (1881) praised Carthew extensively as: Similarly, Goodwin in Carthew's 1887 DNB entry, asserts that \\"this admirable specimen of a county history, skilfully arranged and skilfully executed, illustrated by lithographs, plans, and facsimiles, is unrivalled for the completeness of the manorial descents.\\" Personal life and death On 9 July 1856, Carthew married his first cousin Anna (1806‚Äî1877), daughter of Morden Carthew, vicar of Mattishall, who had earlier married her older brother. Anna's death in 1877, and burial on 4 September, dealt a significant personal blow to Carthew, as he became slow to complete his historical projects, and often fell ill. Around this time, Jessopp promised Carthew that he would put his unfinished material in press, in the event of his untimely death.

Before World War I Rumbeyoƒülu Fahreddin Bey spent most of his working life in the Ottoman diplomatic service. One of his first appearances in Western records was when he was received by Edward VII as first secretary of the Ottoman embassy to the United Kingdom on 13 March 1903. By 1911, Fahreddin Bey was charg√© d'affaires at the Ottoman embassy in Berlin. G√ºl Baba's tomb in Budapest From August to October 1912, Fahreddin Bey was consul- general in the Ottoman missions in Cetinje (now in Montenegro) and in Budapest. During this posting he became interested in restoring the Ottoman Tomb of G√ºl Baba in Budapest and wrote an article on the subject. The Grand Hotel in Caux, where Fahreddin Bey negotiated the Treaty of Ouchy with the Italian government. Rumbeyoƒülu Fahreddin Bey then traveled to Ouchy, near Lausanne, Switzerland, with his fellow ambassador Mehmed N√¢bi Bey to negotiate a settlement to the Italo-Turkish War. Although Fahreddin and Nabi had been appointed by Ottoman Foreign Minister Gabriel Noradunkyan to draw up a treaty, they did not have plenipotentiary powers and their agreement would be subject to approval by the porte. In order to evade press attention, the Ottoman diplomats met in secret with Italian representatives at the Grand Hotel at Caux-sur-Montreux on 12 October 1912. Negotiation was difficult both because the Turks lacked complete authority and because the Italians were intransigent about their territorial demands in North Africa, but eventually an agreement was reached. This settlement, signed on 18 October 1912, is known as the First Treaty of Lausanne or the Treaty of Ouchy. In the treaty Rumbeyoƒülu Fahreddin Bey is noted as a \\"Grand Officer of the Imperial Order of the Mecidiye [and] Commander of the Imperial Order of the Osmaniye\\". From January to November 1914, Fahreddin Bey worked as charg√© d'affaires in St. Petersburg, Russia. After the Black Sea Raid on 29 October 1914, when the Turkish Navy with German assistance bombed five Russian ports on the Black Sea, on 3 November the Russian government expelled Fahreddin Bey, who returned to Istanbul via Finland and Germany. In 1916‚Äì17, towards the end of World War I, Rumbeyoƒülu Fahreddin Bey and Mehmed N√¢bi Bey created several reports to advise the Ottoman government on policy matters. One of these was a memorandum on the history of the Hadhramaut aimed to substantiate Ottoman sovereignty claims during post-war negotiation. After they were unable to find any data on the area in the Ottoman Archives, they resorted to using the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica as their primary source. Membership in the final Ottoman government In April 1920, after the end of World War I, Rumbeyoƒülu Fahreddin Bey was named minister of education in Damat Ferid Pasha's last Ottoman government. His most well-known act in this role was apparently to order the replacement of the word \\"Turkish\\" in schoolbooks with the word \\"Ottoman\\". By July 1920, Fahreddin Bey was appointed minister of justice, continuing in th same role under the new cabinet of Ahmet Tevfik Pasha from August 1920. During this period, Fahreddin Bey was a member of the Kuva-yi Inzibatiye, the \\"Army of the Caliphate\\" that was formed by the Istanbul government to oppose the Turkish National Forces under Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk. He remained in the cabinet until some time in 1921. Fahreddin Bey's prominence in the last Ottoman government drew unfavorable attention in the new Turkish Republic. On 23 April 1924 the Grand National Assembly of Turkey declared Fahreddin Bey among 150 personae non gratae of Turkey for his participation in the Kuva-yi Inzibatiye and membership in the cabinet that acceded to the Treaty of S√®vres, causing him to flee into exile. Following the proclamation of a pardon in 1938, Rumbeyoƒülu Fahreddin Bey returned to Turkey where he died in 1943.

She lived in London from 2011 to 2018, before moving back to California. Self-described as an \\"ethical hacker\\", she founded the white hat consultancy Hacker House in 2016 and organised the Innotech Network from 2012. Her friendship with the then Mayor of London Boris Johnson from 2012 came to national attention in the UK in September 2019 when he became Prime Minister, triggering investigations into alleged conflicts of interest. Career Arcuri previously lived in California and New York. At university, she studied politics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, theatre at Pace University in New York, filmmaking at the University of Southern California, and film at the American University in Paris for a summer. She briefly modelled and acted, including in a short film titled Commute. In California, she worked in film, including digital distribution, and production, sending a short film titled La Valise to Cannes. Acuri owned a video streaming site for filmmakers, Ubroadcast, until selling it to Diamond I in 2009. =Technology= In 2008, Arcuri first visited London to take part in a Bollywood film, Naughty @ 40. She moved to London in early 2011. Arcuri studied for an MBA at Hult International Business School, where she met Tom Hayes and founded software company Title X Technology with him in 2012, using developers in Bulgaria. She defended Hayes in the Wall Street Journal after he came under investigation for the Libor scandal in 2013, for which he was later sentenced to 14 years in jail. From 2012, Arcuri organised the Innotech Summit in London. She founded the Tech Hotel in Shoreditch and was involved with Founders for Schools. She also founded Playbox, a video social network for entrepreneurs. She received an entrepreneur's visa after three years in the UK, after raising over ¬£200,000 in funding for Innotech. By 2016, Innotech Network was noted as a meeting place for the tech industry and policymakers such as Boris Johnson. In November 2016, she worked with Sky News on a report that showed that the UK NHS had spent nothing on cyber-security during 2015; she noted that security was generally lacking in NHS trusts. In 2016, she headed the Tech London Advocates working group on cyber tech. She also founded Hacker House in 2016, a consultancy that advises and trains on cybersecurity, coming out of a \\"Legislating Lulzsec\\" event run by Innotech in October 2014. Hacker House received a grant from the UK Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Cyber Skills Immediate Impact Fund in 2019, sharing ¬£500,000 with three other projects. Acuri has encouraged other women and girls to become involved in the sector and ran the PinkSheet, a list of UK women expert professionals. She spoke at TEDxLiverpool in 2016 and at TEDxManchester in 2017. Recognition She was recognised several times by Computer Weekly: in 2016, she was named as one of five \\"rising stars\\" among women in UK IT; she was named 18th of 50 of the \\"most influential women in UK tech\\" in 2017; she was longlisted for the same award in 2018 and 2019. SC Magazine listed Acuri among twenty \\"women to watch\\" in UK cybersecurity in 2017. Personal life Arcuri's grandfather was lawyer Richard Cates. His daughter Christine Jendrzejewski is Arcuri's mother. Arcuri is married to Matthew Hickey, the co- director of Hacker House, with whom she had a daughter in 2017. They moved to Orange County, California in June 2018. =Relationship to Boris Johnson= Arcuri had a close friendship with then-Mayor of London Boris Johnson, with The Sunday Times describing him as a regular visitor to her flat, and implying they were in a sexual relationship. Innotech, her company, was awarded ¬£10,000 from a mayoral fund in 2013, followed the next year by Arcuri being awarded ¬£15,000 from a government programme. Johnson intervened to allow her onto three trade mission trips. However, The Sunday Times claimed in September 2019 that Johnson failed to declare his personal relationship as a conflict of interest. Later that month, the Greater London Authority referred Johnson and his actions in the matter to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) \\"so it can assess whether or not it is necessary to investigate the former mayor of London for the criminal offence of misconduct in public office\\". The IOPC is involved because the Mayor is also London's police and crime commissioner. The London Assembly commenced its own investigation, but paused it at the IOPC's request in order to avoid overlap. On 9 November 2019 it was revealed that the IOPC, which had been due to publish a report on its investigation, had decided to do so after the general election of 12 December. On 22 May 2020, the IOPC announced that they would not proceed with a criminal investigation. The IOPC said in its statement \\"While there was no evidence that Mr. Johnson influenced the payment of sponsorship monies or participation in trade missions, there was evidence to suggest that those officers making decisions about sponsorship monies and attendance on trade missions thought that there was a close relationship between Mr. Johnson and Ms. Arcuri, and this influenced their decision-making.\\" On 17 October 2020, Arcuri confirmed that her relationship with Johnson had been sexual.

Queen's Gate by Matt Marga is part of his London Geodes body of work = London Geodes: the beauty inside = The London Geodes sculpture is created with the intent of reproducing geodes in an urban context. They are formed by structures made out of laser cut panels later covered in metal with a cold casting technique. The material is then hand-polished.

The cold casting technique is more ecologically sustainable than the traditional casting via the melting of metal.

This delivers the hot water to a cone- shaped coffee grind holder, which drips into a carafe at 196 to 205 degrees Fahrenheit, considered an optimal temperature range. While the coffee enters the carafe, it passes through a destratification tube. The tube delivers the liquid coffee to the bottom of the carafe, so that weaker coffee (what is dripped through the beans at the end) is distributed evenly with the stronger coffee (that is pumped through the coffee first).

It is classified as an exceptional forest ecosystem. It protects an area on the northeast bank of the Sainte-Marguerite River. Location TheSainte- Marguerite River Old Forest is in two parts on either side of the Marcelle- Gauvreau Ecological Reserve, along the north side of Quebec Route 172. The west part is in the unorganized territory of Mont-Valin in Le Fjord-du- Saguenay Regional County Municipality of the Saguenay‚ÄìLac-Saint-Jean region. The east part is in the La Haute-C√¥te-Nord Regional County Municipality of C√¥te-Nord. The forest covers an area of , and is northwest of Sacr√©-Coeur. The forest is administered by Quebec ªs Ministry of Natural Resources, Wildlife and Parks, Forest Environment Directorate. It was designated old-growth forest in 2003, and has IUCN management category III. A map of the ecological regions of Quebec shows the Sainte-Marguerite River as the boundary between the fir/yellow birch bioclimatic subdomain to the southwest, and the fir/white birch subdomain to the northeast. Technically, the forest is in the latter subdomain. The region has rugged terrain with high hills and mountains cut by steep sided valleys. The forest is on the lower part of a mountainside north of the Sainte-Marguerite Valley. It mainly grows on scree slopes made of stones and rocks from the escarpment, with scattered areas of glacial till or soil. The land slopes steeply and drains fast. Flora The forest has not suffered from serious natural disturbances such as fires, wind storms or insect infestations for a very long time. The balsam fir (Abies balsamea) trees of the forest have never been disturbed by human activities, although a few northern white-cedar (Thuja occidentalis) have been cut. The forest stands are at least 270 to 290 years old, and have been able to evolve naturally. There are senescent trees and much wood debris in different stages of decomposition. There are cedars almost 300 years old with trunk diameters of , and eastern white pine (Pinus strobus) 250 years old with heights of and trunks at least in diameter. Given the high latitude and poor soil conditions, the size of the trees is remarkable. The main stands of the old forest are stands of fir and cedar, in some cases including white pine. The last outbreak of spruce budworm in 1975‚Äì1985 reduced the dominance of the fir, and since then several trees have been blown down by the wind, but only in small areas. The abundant paper birch (Betula papyrifera), almost always in open areas, indicates the frequency of minor disturbances. The fir/cedar stands have large numbers of cedars from 200 to 300 years old, with trunk diameters of . The fir/cedar/white pine stands have white pines more than 230 years old, tall and with trunks in diameter. The abundance of fir in the understory, often with cedar, indicates that these two species will remain dominant for several decades. The white pines, which are at the limit of their natural range, are mostly old specimens located in rocky sites on escarpments.

She was one of the most active organisers in the communist resistance movement around Odense until the end of the war. Early life Born on 2 March 1901 in N√∏rre H√∏jrup near Skamby on the island of Funen, Petra Maria Andersen was the daughter of Niels Andersen (1845‚Äì1920), a schoolteacher, and Rasmine Andersen (1859‚Äì1937). She grew up as one of 10 children in a radical home to the northwest of Odense. After leaving school, she worked for seven years as an office assistant. In 1925, Petersen married Alex Petersen with whom she had a child the same year. She then spent the next few years at home, taking an interest in communist ideology.

She helped to publish and distribute the illegal communist paper Land og Folk and was one of the founders and main contributors of Trods Alt, the monthly communist magazine first published in July 1942. She typed up the articles while her husband and her 14-year old daughter duplicated the pages. After the Freedom Council was established in September 1943, she became a member of the local committee in Odense. From March 1944, when the Gestapo developed an interest in her and her family, she went underground but continued to work for the resistance until the end of the war, becoming one of the most important resistance players in the area despite the fact that she was a woman.

It also affected the coasts of Thrace and the Edremit Gulf.Antonopoulos, 1980 The earthquake affected the eastern Roman empire during the reign of the emperor Justinian I. According to the historian George Kedrenos (11th century), this earthquake is associated with a seismic sea wave (tsunami) which flooded the coasts of Thrace. The cities of Aphrodesion, Dionysioupolis, and Odessa (modern Varna) were reportedly flooded, alongside other settlements of the Gulf of Adramyttium (the Edremit Gulf).Antonopoulos, 1980 According to Kedrenos' description, the sea advanced about inland. Before retreating to its previous position, the sea drowned many people, and caused heavy damage to the affected land areas.Antonopoulos, 1980 The same event is described by the historian Michael Glykas (12th century), who mentions that the event coincided with an outbreak of pestilence in Constantinople. The pestilence was likely the so-called Plague of Justinian. Glykas' dating places the earthquake and tsunami between September 542 and January 543.Antonopoulos, 1980 Kedrenos and Glykas mention the tsunami, but not the earthquake. The earthquake is instead recorded by the historian Theophanes the Confessor (9th century) and mentioned in a different narrative of Kedrenos. Based on their description, the earthquake devastated Cyzicus (modern Bandƒ±rma) and damaged Constantinople. This earthquake is dated to September 542.Antonopoulos, 1980 The closeness of the two events makes it probable that the tsunami was caused by the recorded earthquake. Another earthquake which is reported to have damaged Constantinople in 542 may instead be a different reference to the same event. If not, two or more earthquakes may have occurred within a short time span. This would indicate an activation of seismic activity in the Sea of Marmara.Antonopoulos, 1980 Notes References Sources * Category:542 Category:540s in the Byzantine Empire Category:6th-century earthquakes Category:Sea of Marmara Category:Earthquakes in the Byzantine Empire ","title":"542 Sea of Marmara earthquake"},{"id":"61866262","text":"Hilarempis alpha is a species of dance flies, in the fly family Empididae.

Originally published in Polish by Wydawnictwo Literackie, it was later translated to English by Antonia Lloyd-Jones and published in 2018 by the British independent publisher Fitzcarraldo Editions. The book received a wider release in 2019 when it was published in the United States by Riverhead Books on 13 August 2019. A portion of the English translation was originally published in literary magazine Granta in 2017. The novel was shortlisted for the 2019 International Booker Prize. Antonia Lloyd-Jones' translation was also longlisted for the 2019 National Book Award for Translated Literature. Tokarczuk was awarded the 2018 Nobel Prize in Literature two months after the novel's US release. In 2020, it was shortlisted for the International Dublin Literary Award. Plot Janina Duszejko is an ageing woman who lives in a rural Polish village, located near the Czech border in the Silesia region, in between Lewin and K≈Çodzko. Janina spends most of her time studying astrology and translating the poetry of William Blake into Polish with her friend Dizzy. She had two dogs as pets but they both went missing. One day, her neighbour Big Foot, a frequent hunter, is found dead in his home by Janina's friend Oddball. From Janina and Oddball's inspection of the scene, it seems Big Foot choked on a bone while eating. Janina also finds a shocking photograph in Big Foot's house, the contents of which are revealed in the penultimate chapter. Janina disliked Big Foot because she disagrees with hunting animals. She begins to believe that animals could have killed Big Foot out of vengeance. She writes to the local police, who ignore her theory. The police commandant‚Äìcalled the Commandant by Janina‚Äìis also a hunter and is later found dead beside his car by Dizzy. The Commandant's death emboldens Janina's beliefs, but her friends Dizzy and Oddball are sceptical of her. Janina is questioned by police as a witness to the crime scene. One officer accuses Janina of seemingly valuing the life of animals more than that of humans. Janina tells them that she values both equally. The village's wealthy fur farmer and brothel owner, Innerd, goes missing. Residents are convinced he ran away with his lover. An entomologist named Borys‚Äìspelled \\"Boros\\" by Janina‚Äìcomes to the village. He is researching endangered beetles and hopes to convince the Polish government to protect them from extinction. Janina likes Boros and allows him to move in with her. The two eventually become romantically involved. Innerd is later found dead in the forest, with an animal snare around his leg. Weeks later, the President, leader of a local social club and also a hunter, is found dead, covered in beetles. A new Catholic chapel is opened in the village and Father Rustle, a local Catholic priest and avid hunter, is its leader. In one of his sermons, Father Rustle praises hunters, calling them \\"ambassadors and partners of the Lord God in the work of creation.\\" Janina interrupts the sermon, yelling at Rustle and the rest of the villagers. She asks, \\"Have you fallen asleep? How can you listen to such nonsense without batting an eyelid? Have you lost your minds? Or your hearts? Have you still got hearts?\\" Days later, the presbytery burns down and Father Rustle is found dead. Dizzy and Oddball confront Janina, telling her they know she did it and the circumstances of the President's death gave her away. Janina shows her friends the photograph she found at Big Foot's house, which shows Big Foot, the Commandant, Innerd, the President, and Father Rustle standing near recently killed animals, including her two dogs. Big Foot, she explains, really did choke on a deer bone, but this event, and her discovery of the photograph, inspired her to kill the next four men. The next day, police arrive at Janina's house and search it, but she evades capture. Janina and Boros then flee to the Czech Republic. Title The book draws its title from William Blake's poem \\"Proverbs of Hell\\". Reception At the review aggregator website Book Marks, which assigns individual ratings to book reviews from mainstream literary critics, the novel received a cumulative \\"Rave\\" rating based on 21 reviews: 17 \\"Rave\\" reviews, 3 \\"Positive\\" reviews, and 1 \\"Mixed\\" review. Kirkus Reviews praised the novel, writing, \\"Tokarczuk's novel is a riot of quirkiness and eccentricity, and the mood of the book, which shifts from droll humor to melancholy to gentle vulnerability, is unclassifiable‚Äîand just right. Tokarczuk's mercurial prose seems capable of just about anything.\\" Publishers Weekly called the novel \\"astounding\\" and wrote that it \\"succeeds as both a suspenseful murder mystery and a powerful and profound meditation on human existence and how a life fits into the world around it.\\" Writing for The Guardian, author Sarah Perry favourably reviewed the novel, saying, \\"It is an astonishing amalgam of thriller, comedy and political treatise, written by a woman who combines an extraordinary intellect with an anarchic sensibility.\\" Adaptations =Film= The novel was adapted into film in 2017, titled Spoor (), directed by Polish director Agnieszka Holland. = Audio= Polish actress Beata Po≈∫niak narrated the English translation of Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead for Penguin Random House released on August 13th 2019. She received an Earphones Award for best audiobook interpretation. In May 2020, Fitzcarraldo Editions released an audiobook in the UK read by the book's translator, Antonia Lloyd-Jones.
