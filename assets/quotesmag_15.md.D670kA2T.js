Noa was laid down by the Bath Iron Works, Bath, Maine, on 26 March 1945; launched on 30 July 1945, sponsored by Mrs. James Cary Jones, Jr., wife of Rear Admiral James Cary Jones, Jr., USN; and commissioned on 2 November 1945, Commander R. L. Nolan, Jr., USN, in command.  1945 ‚Äì 1960  After shakedown at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, Noa departed her homeport of Norfolk, Virginia for her first Mediterranean deployment. She called at Gibraltar, Nice, Naples, Malta, Venice, Piraeus, and Lisbon. After participating in fleet maneuvers in the South Atlantic in early 1947, the Noa returned to the United States. For the next two years she exercised in type training, underwent overhaul, and acted as school training ship for the Fleet Sonar School in Key West, Florida. The Noa served as rescue destroyer for the aircraft carrier during June and July 1949. From September 1949 through January 1951, she engaged in extended antisubmarine warfare training in a permanent ASW hunter-killer group as a unit of Destroyer Squadron Eight (DesRon 8). She also made a second Mediterranean deployment during this period. In early 1951 she participated in Convex II, a large scale convoy escort exercise, after which she called at Baltimore, Maryland. The next two years were devoted to upkeep and operational training along the East coast. In August 1953, the Noa departed from Norfolk on a 42,000-mile (78,000 km) around-the-world cruise. She arrived Sasebo, Japan on 3 October and spent four months operating in the Sea of Japan with Task Force 77. Here she participated in operational readiness exercises while maintaining truce patrol off the Korean coast. In November 1953, the Noa operated in Japanese waters as part of a hunter-killer group. She patrolled the Korean coast together with the in late November and early December. From then until her return to the United States in April 1954, the Noa engaged in underway training. Upon her return to Norfolk, she was reassigned to hunter-killer duty in the Atlantic Ocean. On 7 September 1954, the Noa left Norfolk to participate in a joint NATO antisubmarine warfare exercise named \\"Black Jack\\". After visiting Derry, Northern Ireland, and ports in the Mediterranean, she was due to return to Norfolk on 12 November 1954. After leaving Gibraltar, the destroyer group was caught in hurricane force winds reaching . The Noa recorded rolls in excess of 50 degrees, Some of the destroyers sustained heavy damage in the storm. The Noa and the other destroyers found safe haven at the port of Ponta Delgada on S√£o Miguel Island in the Azores. The destroyer group, along with the aircraft carrier , arrived at Norfolk one day late, on 13 November 1954. After returning, the Noa reported to the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard at Philadelphia for an overhaul. During the overhaul in the summer of 1955, the Noa was outfitted with experimental sonar equipment that she tested in the Key West area. She departed Norfolk Naval Shipyard in February 1956 for her third Mediterranean deployment. Upon return to homeport the following summer, she trained in the eastern Atlantic. In the spring 1957 she steamed to the Caribbean for Operation Springboard 1‚Äì57 and Desairdex 1‚Äì57. After completion of a three-month overhaul at Norfolk Naval Shipyard in August 1957 she steamed for five weeks of refresher training at Guantanamo and for shore bombardment exercises at Culebra Island, Puerto Rico. In winter of 1957‚Äì8, Noa served as test ship for experimental radio equipment and in spring 1958 she was again taking part in Springboard exercises in the Caribbean. March 1957 saw the Noa as a participant in Lantphibex 1‚Äì58, an exercise designed to test the latest amphibious warfare concepts. During the summer of 1958, the Noa took part in 6th Fleet operations during the Lebanon crisis. After a short tour in the Persian Gulf she returned to Norfolk and joined the 2nd Fleet for Lantphibex 2‚Äì58. In February 1959, the Noa was again deployed to the Mediterranean. She participated in Sixth Fleet exercises through 1 April when she steamed for the Middle East via the Suez Canal. She called at Massawa, Ethiopia; Bombay, India; Bahrain; Saudi Arabia; Bandar Shahpur, Iran; and Aden. In late June, the Noa rejoined the Sixth Fleet after having gone eighty-three days without replenishment. She returned to Norfolk on 1 September, and then transferred from Destroyer Squadron Six to Squadron Fourteen, with a new homeport at Mayport, Florida. Through spring 1960 she operated off the Atlantic Coast and in the Caribbean, She entered the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on 25 May for a Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM), and she received the latest in antisubmarine warfare (ASW) equipment.  1961 ‚Äì 1973  Noa completed her FRAM I overhaul on 2 May 1961, and she rejoined the Atlantic Fleet. After a four-week ready-for-sea period and ASROC qualification trials, she reported to Fleet Training Command, Guantanamo, for six weeks refresher training. Noa returned to Mayport on 23 July for a two-week destroyer-tender period alongside the . Training followed, and the Noa steamed for the United Kingdom, for combined exercises in the Eastern Atlantic with the Royal Navy. She arrived at Portsmouth, England on 6 November, and also called at Belfast and Dublin before standing in to homeport on 20 December. After leave and upkeep, the Noa resumed ASW training on 29 January 1962 in the western Atlantic. The Noa returned to Mayport on 6 February for modifications to her boat davits and briefings in preparation for the recovery of both America's first astronaut to orbit the Earth and his spacecraft. Preparations completed, she steamed on 11 February for the Project Mercury recovery area in the southwestern Atlantic, she reported on station on 14 February as part of the 24-ship recovery task force. After two reschedulings of the space flight, the Noa put in at San Juan, Puerto Rico, for two days. She was underway on 19 February for the recovery station, located 200 miles WNW of San Juan. On 20 February, at precisely 14:40, five hours and 53 minutes after launch, Friendship 7 reentered the atmosphere with a loud sonic boom that was clearly audible in Noa. She sighted and recovered Lt. Col. John H. Glenn, Jr., USMC, Project Mercury astronaut, after he had completed three orbits of the Earth and splashed down three miles from the destroyer. Enthusiastic crewmen used white paint to draw circles around Glenn's footsteps when he stepped onto the ship's deck.Kranz, Gene.

Glenn remained aboard Noa for three hours before a helicopter transferred him to the , the primary recovery ship. Upon completion of recovery operations, the Noa returned to Mayport for ASW operations with Task Group Alpha until on 31 May. The Noa then conducted type training and midshipmen cruises out of her homeport between Mediterranean operational deployments and upkeep. She steamed for the Mediterranean on 3 August 1962 for a seven-month tour with the Sixth Fleet and on 8 February 1964 saw her stand out of Mayport for another six- month Mediterranean deployment. Her regularly scheduled overhaul took place at Charlestown from September 1964 through January 1965, followed by a Mediterranean deployment from mid-May through 1 September. In early October 1965, the Noa steamed from Mayport for the Gemini VI recovery off the west coast of Africa. The flight was cancelled after the Agena-B rocket designed to launch a docking vehicle failed to achieve an orbital insertion. The Noa then participated in training and Atlantic Fleet exercises, including \\"High Time\\", an amphibious exercise in the Caribbean from late January through early March 1966. She also served as a unit of the Gemini 8 recovery forces 14‚Äì17 March 1966. Her April‚ÄìOctober deployment to the Mediterranean was followed by leave, upkeep and Lantflex (28 November ‚Äì 15 December). In January 1967, the Noa received two QH-50 DASH drone antisubmarine helicopters. She then served as school ship for the Fleet Sonar School at Key West (28 January ‚Äì 11 February). \\"Operation Springboard\\" took her to the Caribbean 3‚Äì11 March and she steamed in Mediterranean waters June through November. The Noa stood out of Mayport on 5 January 1968 to conduct a solemn mission ‚Äì the burial at sea of George H. Flynt, YN1 (Ret.). Flynt's last wish was that his remains be consigned to the deep. The Noa underwent regular availability and overhaul at Charleston commencing 8 January 1968. Work was completed 17 June and the destroyer was in Mayport on 25 June. Because of excessive vibration in her starboard shaft, the Noa returned to drydock at Charleston on 8 July for one week. She steamed for Guantanamo for refresher training after which she returned to Mayport on 11 September. Homeported once again the destroyer conducted maintenance and training and began preparation for deployment to the Pacific. During October she was in restricted availability at Jacksonville, Florida, for boiler repairs. She rode out Hurricane Gladys on 19 October and then spent the rest of the year in training and in preparation for her deployment to the Western Pacific in 1969. 1969‚Äì1973 \\"In May 1972, the Noa went to Guantanamo Bay for training. The ship was scheduled for overhaul and needed work done before she could again be deployed.\\" In June - September 1972, Noa underwent overhaul at the Jacksonville, Fl shipyard. Repairs were made to the outer and inner hull. Lagging was replaced throughout the ship. Noa returned to Gitmo in November, 1972 for refresher training. She left Mayport for her last deployment as an American ship in January 1973, headed for the Middle East. Her deployment was a second one to the Middle East Force in the Indian Ocean and Arabian (Persian) Gulf. Because the Suez Canal was still mined from the Arab-Israeli war, [i]Noa[/i] went to the Indian Ocean via the Cape of Good Hope. She transited via Port of Spain, Trinidad, Recife, Brazil, Luanda, Angola, Laurenco Marques (Now Maputo) Mozambique and relieved in Port Louis , Mauritius.

History  Societal views and legal repercussions have varied greatly in regards to senicide.  Philosophical views  Pythagorean doctrine held that all creatures were being punished by the gods who imprisoned the creatures' souls in a body. Thus, any attempt to alter this punishment would be seen as a direct violation of the gods' wills.Garland, Robert; The Greek Way of Death. (London: Duckworth, 1985) 98. In the fourth century BC, the Hippocratic Oath was developed and reads, \\"I will not give a fatal draught to anyone if I am asked, nor will I suggest any such thing.\\"The Guide to Life, the Universe, and Everything. BBC. ‚ÄúThe Hippocratic Oath.\\" 29 October 2006. Through the lens of the Hippocratic Oath, euthanasia by means of a fatal draught was forbidden. However, one of the most famous examples of deviation from this code occurred when the physician of Seneca, a philosopher and tutor of Nero, provided the scholar, who was 69 years old at the time, with poison for one of his many failed attempts at suicide.  Religious views  The societies of antiquity viewed suicide and euthanasia very differently from modern culture. Although factors such as better medical and psychological insight have affected contemporary society's view of suicide and euthanasia, much of the shift in opinion of these forms of death occurred because of the change in religion‚Äîthat is, Greco-Roman society was dominated by pagan religions that did not categorically condemn suicide and euthanasia. Many modern Christians do not accept the practice of suicide or senicide, holding that only God should have control over a person's life and death.Mystakidou, Kyriaki, Efi Parpa, Eleni Tsilika, Emmanuaela Katsouda & Lambros Vlahos; \\"The Evolution of Euthanasia and its Perceptions in Greek Culture and Civilization.\\" Perspectives in Biology and Medicine, vol. 48, no. 1 (2005), 95. 21 October 2006 By culture =Heruli= The Heruli were a Germanic tribe during the Migration Period (about 400 to 800 CE). Procopius states in his work The Wars, that the Heruli placed the sick and elderly on a tall stack of wood and stabbed them to death before setting the pyre alight.Procopius, History of the Wars, Book VI, chapter XIV. Wikisource = India = In the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, the illegal practice of senicide ‚Äì known locally as thalaikoothal ‚Äì is said to occur dozens or perhaps hundreds of times each year. = Inuit = A common belief is that the Inuit would leave their elderly on the ice to die. Senicide among the Inuit people was rare, except during famines. The last known case of an Inuit senicide was in 1939.\\"Did Eskimos put their elderly on ice floes to die?\\" The Straight Dope (May 4, 2004)\\"Senilicide and Invalidicide among the Eskimos\\" by Rolf KjellstrÔøΩm in Folk: Dansk etnografisk tidsskrift, volume 16/17 (1974/75)\\"Notes on Eskimo Patterns of Suicide\\" by Alexander H. Leighton and Charles C. Hughes in Southwestern Journal of Anthropology, volume 11 (1955)Eskimos and Explorers, 2d ed., by Wendell H. Oswalt (1999) =Japan= Ubasute (Âß•Êç®, 'abandoning an old woman'), a custom allegedly performed in Japan in the distant past, whereby an infirm or elderly relative was carried to a mountain, or some other remote, desolate place, and left there to die. This custom has been vividly depicted in The Ballad of Narayama (a 1956 novel by Shichir≈ç Fukazawa, a 1958 film, and a 1983 film). =Sardinia= An alleged custom was to throw incapable or ill elders off certain cliffs, a confirmed practice was the performing of euthanasia on ill, senile or suffering elders carried out by selected women named accabbadoras (lit. 'terminator' or 'ender') that after a blessing of the soon to be deceased would proceed to kill them through suffocation or blunt force to the back of the head by wooden mallet. =Scandinavia= In Nordic folklore, the √§ttestupa is a cliff where elderly people were said to leap, or be thrown, to death. While the practice has no historical evidence, the trope has survived as an urban legend, and a metaphor for deficient welfare for the elderly. =Serbia= Lapot is a mythical Serbian practice of disposing of one's parents. =Greece= Parkin provides eighteen cases of senicide which the people of antiquity believed happened. Of these cases, only two of them occurred in Greek society; another took place in Roman society, while the rest happened in other cultures. One example that Parkin provides is of the island of Keos in the Aegean Sea. Although many different variations of the Keian story exist, the legendary practice may have begun when the Athenians besieged the island. In an attempt to preserve the food supply, the Keians voted for all people over 60 years of age to commit suicide by drinking hemlock. The other case of Roman senicide occurred on the island of Sardinia, where human sacrifices of 70-years-old fathers were made by their sons to the titan Cronus. =Rome= The case of institutionalized senicide occurring in Rome comes from a proverb stating that 60-year-olds were to be thrown from the bridge. Whether or not this act occurred in reality was highly disputed in antiquity and continues to be doubted today. The most comprehensive explanation of the tradition comes from Festus writing in the fourth century AD who provides several different beliefs of the origin of the act, including human sacrifice by ancient Roman natives, a Herculean association, and the notion that older men should not vote because they no longer provided a duty to the state. This idea to throw older men into the river probably coincides with the last explanation given by Festus. That is, younger men did not want the older generations to overshadow their wishes and ambitions and, therefore, suggested that the old men should be thrown off the bridge, where voting took place, and not be allowed to vote.

The story was set in Newcastle-upon-Tyne and the surrounding area, and featured pigeon racers and runners competing in the Great North Run. The main character is Spuggy Hilton (Spuggy being a nickname ‚Äì the Geordie word for sparrow), who isn't a runner like the rest of his family, but is a keen pigeon fancier and owns 'Blue Flash' ‚Äì one of the best birds in Newcastle. He and his friend Janie observe some suspicious activity, and link a spate of local art robberies with obscure messages they find on some of the pigeons, but find they have even more problems when they go to spy on the crooks. Geordie Racer was praised for attempting to bring a grittier edge to educational programmes shown in primary schools. The series also featured Geordie actor Kevin Whately as Spuggy's father.

It was discovered at the archaeological site of Caesarea Maritima in 1961. The artifact is particularly significant because it is an archaeological find of an authentic 1st-century Roman inscription mentioning the name \\"[Pont]ius Pilatus\\". It is contemporary to Pilate's lifetime, and accords with what is known of his reported career.Archaeology and the Galilean Jesus: a re-examination of the evidence by Jonathan L. Reed 2002 p. 18Studying the historical Jesus: evaluations of the state of current research by Bruce Chilton, Craig A. Evans 1998 p. 465 In effect, the inscription constitutes the earliest surviving, and only contemporary, record of Pilate, who is otherwise known from the New Testament, the Jewish historian Josephus and writer Philo, and brief references by Roman historians such as Tacitus. It is likely that Pontius Pilate made his base at Caesarea Maritima - the site where the stone was discovered, since that city had replaced Jerusalem as the administrative capital and military headquarters of the province in AD 6,A History of the Jewish People, H.H. Ben-Sasson editor, 1976, p. 247: \\"When Judea was converted into a Roman province [in 6 CE, p. 246], the Romans moved the governmental residence and military headquarters from Jerusalem to Caesarea. The centre of government was thus removed from Jerusalem, and the administration became increasingly based on inhabitants of the Hellenistic cities (Sebaste, Caesarea and others). Pilate probably travelled to Jerusalem, the central city of the province's Jewish population, only when necessary.Historical Dictionary of Jesus by Daniel J. Harrington 2010 p. 32 The Pilate stone is currently located at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem.Jerry Vardaman, A New Inscription Which Mentions Pilate as 'Prefect' , Journal of Biblical Literature Vol. 81, 1962. pp. 70‚Äì71.Craig A. Evans, Jesus and the ossuaries, Volume 44, Baylor University Press, 2003. pp. 45‚Äì47 Plaster-cast replicas can be found at the Archaeological Museum in Milan, Italy, and on display in Caesarea Maritima itself. Inscription On the partially damaged block is a dedication to the deified Augustus and Livia (\\"the Divine Augusti\\"), the stepfather and mother of emperor Tiberius, originally placed within a Tiberieum, probably a temple dedicated to Tiberius. It has been deemed authentic because it was discovered in the coastal town of Caesarea, which was the capital of Iudaea Province during the time Pontius Pilate was Roman governor. The partial inscription reads (conjectural letters in brackets): :[DIS AUGUSTI]S TIBERI√âUM :[...PONTI]US PILATUS :[...PRAEF]ECTUS IUDA[EA]E :[...FECIT D]E[DICAVIT] The translation from Latin to English for the inscription reads: :To the Divine Augusti [this] Tiberieum :...Pontius Pilate :...prefect of Judea :...has dedicated [this] Discovery Pontius Pilate inscription; the original stone, now located in the Israel Museum, Jerusalem The limestone block was discovered in June 1961 by Italian archaeologists led by Dr. Antonio Frova while excavating in the area of an ancient theatre built by decree of Herod the Great around 22‚Äì10 BC, along with the entire city of Caesarea. The artifact is a fragment of the dedicatory inscription of a later building, probably a temple, that was constructed, possibly in honour of the emperor Tiberius,Tacitus, Annals, 15.44 dating to 26‚Äì36 AD. The stone was then reused in the 4th century as a building block for a set of stairs belonging to a structure erected behind the stage house of the Herodian theatre, and it was discovered there, still attached to the ancient staircase, by the archaeologists.A.N.

Taloqan was the last major city to fall to the Taliban, on 5 September 2000, after a siege which claimed the lives of hundreds of civilians. A bloody capture by the Taliban also triggered a mass exodus in the population, with civilians fleeing towards Imam Sahib and the Panjshir Valley.

In his youth Ibn ·∏§abib studied the Talmud under rabbi Samuel Valensi.  Ein Yaakov  In 1492, when the Jews were expelled from Spain, he settled at Salonica, where he wrote his Ein Yaakov in the house of Don Judah Benveniste, grandson of Don Abraham Benveniste, who placed his rich library at his disposal. Ibn ·∏§abib also availed himself of the library of Don Shemuel Benveniste the brother of Judah, which contained, among other great works, a large collection of novell√¶ on the Talmud by many distinguished commentators. By the aid of the works from these two libraries Ibn ·∏§abib collected all the aggadic passages from the Babylonian Talmud, and many from the Jerusalem Talmud. The publication of this work began in 1516 in the printing establishment of Judah Gedaliah, the author himself carefully reading the proof-sheets; but he died at Salonica just as the first two orders (Zeraim and Moed) came from the press. His son, R. Levi, completed the labors of his father, but the work appeared before the public without the notes of the author to the last four orders (sedarim), and without the index, which the author originally intended to cover the entire work. The aggadot of the Jerusalem Talmud are also lacking. The Ein Yaakov is the only work Ibn ·∏§abib left to the world. The object of the author was to familiarize the public with the ethical spirit of Talmudic literature; at the same time his notes were intended to refute the charges brought against the Talmud by the numerous Spanish converts. The book, which thus appealed to the mass of the unlearned, became very popular. It was often edited and annotated, and served as a text-book of religious instruction. There are over thirty editions known; the latest [as of 1906] (Vilna, 1883) contains twenty commentaries, among them one which consists of selections from more than one hundred homiletic works. Of the additions, the most important one is that of Leone di Modena, under the title Ha-Boneh, which has appeared in all editions since 1684. The author's intention was chiefly to propagate a more rationalistic view of the Talmudic Aggadah. In some editions the title of the whole work is Ein Yisrael.

SCIAF works in 26 countries across Asia, Africa and Latin America to help some of the poorest people in the world, regardless of religion, work their way out of poverty. Introduction Today, SCIAF supports over 80 long term development projects helping people affected by conflict, hunger, HIV/AIDS, lack of health care and disability. SCIAF also responds to humanitarian disasters, such as the southeast Asian tsunami and the long running conflict in Darfur, with emergency provisions and support. In Scotland, SCIAF campaigns to address the underlying causes of global poverty and injustice, such as unfair trade and debt, by lobbying governments, businesses, and international organisations to bring about long-term change. SCIAF works closely with schools and young people across Scotland to educate the ‚Äòdecision makers of the future‚Äô and give them opportunities to get involved in fighting global injustice. History SCIAF was set up in 1965 by the Catholic Bishops of Scotland to give practical help to the world's poorest people and to raise awareness of the causes of their poverty. In its first 40 years SCIAF raised over ¬£65 million. On SCIAF's 40th anniversary, then Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown paid this tribute: \\"From small beginnings in 1965 in a small school classroom in Rutherglen‚Ä¶ with funds of just ¬£8,000‚Ä¶SCIAF has grown into Scotland's leading international aid charity.\\" Caritas Internationalis SCIAF is a member of Caritas Internationalis, the worldwide network of 163 Catholic aid agencies which is one of the biggest humanitarian organisations in the world. It includes SCIAF, CAFOD in England and Wales and Trocaire in Ireland. SCIAF is also a member of CIDSE (International Co-operation for Development and Solidarity) which is an alliance of 16 Catholic development organisations from Europe and North America. CIDSE members work together to tackle the root causes of poverty and injustice. Fundraising SCIAF helps to fund, and is aided with funds raised by, the national will-making scheme Will aid, in which participating solicitors waive their usual fee to write a basic will and in exchange invite the client to donate to charity.Will Aid See also *Caritas Internationalis *Caritas Europa References External links * Scottish Catholic International Aid Fund Category:1965 establishments in Scotland Category:Christian charities based in Scotland Category:Catholic charities Category:Catholic Church in Scotland Category:Development charities based in the United Kingdom Category:International charities Category:Christian organizations established in 1965 Category:Charities based in Glasgow Category:CIDSE ","title":"Scottish Catholic International Aid Fund"},{"id":"7714374","text":"Founding Brothers: The Revolutionary Generation is a Pulitzer Prize-winning book written by Joseph Ellis, a professor of history at Mount Holyoke College, which won the 2001 Pulitzer Prize for History. It explores selected interactions among a group of individuals both gifted and flawed; interactions that profoundly influenced the early development of the United States. Overview Ellis constructed his book by assessing certain events during the decade following the 1787 Constitutional Convention, > He chooses to do this not in any systematic or comprehensive manner, but by > focusing on a half-dozen political personages (John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, > George Washington, James Madison, Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr) and a > handful of revealing episodes that would test their convictions and > friendships.Michiko Kakutani, \\"In the Course of Human Events, Lady Luck Had > a Role\\", New York Times, 14 November 2000, accessed 16 February 2012 He notes that Ellis borrowed his technique from Lytton Strachey's classic study, Eminent Victorians, about notable English figures. *Chapter One: The Duel covers the deadly political and personal rivalry between Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton, which ultimately led to the Burr-Hamilton duel, which Ellis attributes in part to the passions inflamed by the Revolution. Only a few facts are known about \\"the most famous encounter of its kind in American history.\\" (pg 20) Burr and Hamilton rowed out to a secluded spot in separate boats and exchanged pistol shots from 10 paces apart. Hamilton was shot in his right side and died. *Chapter Two: The Dinner explores the secret conversations and negotiations leading to selection of the Potomac River site for construction of the new national capital, in exchange for Virginia's support of Hamilton's plan for assumption of state debts by the federal government. *Chapter Three: The Silence describes the tacit agreement by the nation's founders to postpone discussion of regulation of Slavery in the United States, concluding that any early attempt at abolition would doom the union before it had a chance to become established. *Chapter Four: The Farewell dissects the Farewell Address of President George Washington, and Washington's views on the best course for the new nation, and a slightly in depth look into some of the views the founding fathers had on issues, such as Jay's Treaty. *Chapter Five: The Collaborators analyzes two important relationships; the one between John Adams and his wife Abigail during his presidency; and the other between Thomas Jefferson and James Madison during the same time period. *Chapter Six: The Friendship is devoted to the extensive correspondence between Adams and Jefferson during the last fourteen years of their lives, reviving their lost friendship and expounding on their lives. Awards * 2001: Pulitzer Prize for History Reviews Joyce Appleby of The Washington Post Book World commented that, \\"In lesser hands the fractious disputes and hysterical rhetoric of these contentious nation-builders might come across as hyperbolic pettiness. Ellis knows better, and he unpacks the real issues for his readers, revealing the driving assumptions and riveting fears that animated Americans' first encounter with the organized ideologies and interests we call parties.\\" Movie In 2002, The History Channel produced a three-and-a-half hour documentary covering the various topics of the book. In 2011 Ellis co-authored a screen statement with a former student, Daliah Leslie in an effort to make a feature film adaptation.

Finding the longest induced path in a hypercube is known as the snake- in-the-box problem. In the mathematical area of graph theory, an induced path in an undirected graph G is a path that is an induced subgraph of G. That is, it is a sequence of vertices in G such that each two adjacent vertices in the sequence are connected by an edge in G, and each two nonadjacent vertices in the sequence are not connected by any edge in G. An induced path is sometimes called a snake, and the problem of finding long induced paths in hypercube graphs is known as the snake-in-the-box problem. Similarly, an induced cycle is a cycle that is an induced subgraph of G; induced cycles are also called chordless cycles or (when the length of the cycle is four or more) holes. An antihole is a hole in the complement of G, i.e., an antihole is a complement of a hole. The length of the longest induced path in a graph has sometimes been called the detour number of the graph;. for sparse graphs, having bounded detour number is equivalent to having bounded tree-depth., Proposition 6.4, p. 122. The induced path number of a graph G is the smallest number of induced paths into which the vertices of the graph may be partitioned,. and the closely related path cover number of G is the smallest number of induced paths that together include all vertices of G.. The girth of a graph is the length of its shortest cycle, but this cycle must be an induced cycle as any chord could be used to produce a shorter cycle; for similar reasons the odd girth of a graph is also the length of its shortest odd induced cycle.  Example  The illustration shows a cube, a graph with eight vertices and twelve edges, and an induced path of length four in this graph. A straightforward case analysis shows that there can be no longer induced path in the cube, although it has an induced cycle of length six. The problem of finding the longest induced path or cycle in a hypercube, first posed by , is known as the snake-in-the-box problem, and it has been studied extensively due to its applications in coding theory and engineering.  Characterization of graph families  Many important graph families can be characterized in terms of the induced paths or cycles of the graphs in the family. * Trivially, the connected graphs with no induced path of length two are the complete graphs, and the connected graphs with no induced cycle are the trees. * A triangle- free graph is a graph with no induced cycle of length three. * The cographs are exactly the graphs with no induced path of length three. * The chordal graphs are the graphs with no induced cycle of length four or more. * The even-hole-free graphs are the graphs in containing no induced cycles with an even number of vertices. * The trivially perfect graphs are the graphs that have neither an induced path of length three nor an induced cycle of length four. * By the strong perfect graph theorem, the perfect graphs are the graphs with no odd hole and no odd antihole. * The distance-hereditary graphs are the graphs in which every induced path is a shortest path, and the graphs in which every two induced paths between the same two vertices have the same length. * The block graphs are the graphs in which there is at most one induced path between any two vertices, and the connected block graphs are the graphs in which there is exactly one induced path between every two vertices.  Algorithms and complexity  It is NP-complete to determine, for a graph G and parameter k, whether the graph has an induced path of length at least k. credit this result to an unpublished communication of Mihalis Yannakakis. However, this problem can be solved in polynomial time for certain graph families, such as asteroidal-triple-free graphs. or graphs with no long holes.. It is also NP-complete to determine whether the vertices of a graph can be partitioned into two induced paths, or two induced cycles.. As a consequence, determining the induced path number of a graph is NP-hard. The complexity of approximating the longest induced path or cycle problems can be related to that of finding large independent sets in graphs, by the following reduction.. From any graph G with n vertices, form another graph H with twice as many vertices as G, by adding to G n(n ‚àí 1)/2 vertices having two neighbors each, one for each pair of vertices in G. Then if G has an independent set of size k, H must have an induced path and an induced cycle of length 2k, formed by alternating vertices of the independent set in G with vertices of I. Conversely, if H has an induced path or cycle of length k, any maximal set of nonadjacent vertices in G from this path or cycle forms an independent set in G of size at least k/3. Thus, the size of the maximum independent set in G is within a constant factor of the size of the longest induced path and the longest induced cycle in H. Therefore, by the results of on inapproximability of independent sets, unless NP=ZPP, there does not exist a polynomial time algorithm for approximating the longest induced path or the longest induced cycle to within a factor of O(n1/2-Œµ) of the optimal solution. Holes (and antiholes in graphs without chordless cycles of length 5) in a graph with n vertices and m edges may be detected in time (n+m2).. Atomic cycles Atomic cycles are a generalization of chordless cycles, that contain no n-chords. Given some cycle, an n-chord is defined as a path of length n connecting two points on the cycle, where n is less than the length of the shortest path on the cycle connecting those points. If a cycle has no n-chords, it is called an atomic cycle, because it cannot be decomposed into smaller cycles.. In the worst case, the atomic cycles in a graph can be enumerated in O(m2) time, where m is the number of edges in the graph.

Many architectural historians consider it to be one of the finest Greek Revival mansions in the northeastern United States. Town's client was Samuel Wadsworth Russell (1789-1862), the founder of Russell & Company, the largest and most important American firm to do business in the China trade in the 19th century. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970, and designated as a National Historic Landmark in 2001.. It has been owned by Wesleyan University since 1937 and now houses the Department of Philosophy.  Description and significance  This building was erected in 1828 for Samuel Russell (1789‚Äì1862). Russell founded the trading firm of Russell & Company in Canton, China, after serving there as trading representative of the Providence, Rhode Island firm of Edward Carrington & Company. Between 1818 and 1831 Russell made his fortune in the illegal yet highly profitable importation of Turkish and Bengal opium into the port of Canton, and the exportation of fine teas and silks from there to Europe and the United States. In 1828 when his house was built, Russell was in Canton. His friend Samuel D. Hubbard worked with his wife, Mrs. Russell, to supervise the construction of the house. In 1831 Russell returned to Middletown and his new home, where he resided until his death in 1862. The Russell House was designed by Ithiel Town, one of the period's foremost architects and major proponent of the Greek Revival style in America. David Hoadley (of Curtis and Hoadley), a prominent New Haven builder-architect, supervised the construction. The house has the form of a Greek temple with six full-height Corinthian columns supporting a heavy entablature and low flushboarded pediment. The front (west) wall has five bays with recessed panels between the first and second story windows except in the center bay, where pilasters support a high entablature over the double entrance door. This doorway is surrounded by side and overlights whose frames are decorated with fretwork. The windows on the two-bay side facades are separated vertically by panels like those on the front. Stucco scribed to resemble large-block ashlar covers the brick masonry walls. The house has a brownstone foundation supported by load-bearing masonry walls and a gable roof. An antemion decorative motif is used on the portico column capitals, front corner pilasters, and in the attic window screen covers. The heavy entablature has three bands in the architrave; a band of foliated molding under the plain frieze; and a denticulated cornice defined by a bead and reel molding and an elaborate crown molding. Around 1855 the rear portico was enclosed and is now divided by six pilasters (originally square pillars) into five bays of windows with small protruding balconies in the end bays. A two-story north wing, added around 1855, is attributed to Alexander Jackson Davis, a former partner of Ithiel Town. Although not consistent with the symmetry of the whole, it is treated sympathetically through the use of identical pilasters and entablature. The Russell estate occupied all of the block bounded by High, Court, Pearl and Washington streets. Extensive grounds behind Russell House, sloping down to Pearl Street, were planted with formal gardens, which included boxwood imported from England and plants brought from China by Samuel Russell. A double stair of intricate ironwork was added to the rear of the house at the time the portico was enclosed. It leads from the first floor down to the garden lawn. The interior is divided by a spacious center hall with two rooms on either side. A stairway with landing is at the end of the hall. The four chimney stacks are placed in the outside wall of each of the rooms off the hall. The south parlors communicate through a set of folding doors, while the original north rooms have been opened up to provide a single large space. Close attention to detail characterizes the decorative treatment throughout the interior. Trompe l'oeil wall paintings simulate panelling on the walls of the north main rooms, entrance hall, and stairwell. Similarly elaborate decoration is seen in the marble fireplaces, with Ionic columns supporting the mantelpieces, and in the recessed panelling of the doors and folding window shutters. A wide frieze and deep cornice of decorative plaster define the high ceilings of the interior. The Russell House represents a significant stage in the development of Greek Revival architecture in America. In his work Town and Davis, Architects, Roger Hale Newton mentions the Russell House as \\"indicative of the hand of Town in its undeniable sophistication.\\" Professor Talbot Hamlin places its design \\"in the richest Greek vein\\" and also states that \\"its Corinthian columns and open plan are urban and magnificent rather than in the simple old tradition.\\" Newton elaborates on the latter point when he says that the communicating suite of parlors with their grand scale \\"may have reflected an urban development quite contrary... to the prevailing modern provincial places.\\" The Russell House demonstrates an early attempt by Ithiel Town to match the sophisticated design of an imposing Greek temple form with a compatible interior plan suited to living and entertaining on a grand scale. This plan was used in Town and Davis' later work in New York. Its successful application to the temple form provided a basis for vernacular interpretations of the Greek Revival style, which dominated residential construction until the advent of picturesque architecture. The construction of the Russell House in 1828 established a standard of luxury and elegance for the residential architecture on High Street during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Although many other imposing homes were built in this area of Middletown, the Russell House was never surpassed in sophistication and grandeur. It stands as a monument to the personal qualities of Samuel Russell and to the exciting era of the China trade, when Russell carried Middletown's mercantile tradition to its greatest heights.  Relationship to surroundings  The mansion faces west from the southeast corner of High and Washington Streets. The large scale of execution and the imposing qualities of the architecture enable this building to dominate the surrounding area. High Street during the 19th and early 20th centuries was the most prestigious residential area in Middletown. It is now part of the campus of Wesleyan University.  Current use and condition  After the Russell family retained the house for five generations, in 1937Thomas Macdonough Russell, Jr. deeded it to Wesleyan College. The building was used as Honors College until 1996. The building is currently used as a special events facility and as the home of the University's Philosophy department.History of the Russell House, Wesleyan University See also *List of National Historic Landmarks in Connecticut *National Register of Historic Places listings in Middlesex County, Connecticut References  Sources * Middletown, Connecticut Historical and Architectural Resources.

Born towards the middle of the sixth century in Cartagena, Hispania,St. Florentina - Saints & Angels - Catholic Online she and her family were actively engaged in furthering the best interests of Christianity. Florentina was the sister of three Iberian bishops in the time of the Visigothic dominion (Leander, Isidore of Seville, and Fulgentius), she consecrated her virginity to God, and all four have been canonized by the Church. She was younger than her brother Leander, later Archbishop of Seville, but older than Isidore, who succeeded Leander as archbishop of the same see. Before his elevation to the episcopal dignity, Leander had been a monk, and it was through his influence that Florentina embraced the ascetic life. She associated with herself a number of virgins, who also desired to forsake the world, and formed them into a religious community. Later sources declare their residence to have been the convent of S. Maria de Valle near Ecija (Astigis), of which city her brother Fulgentius was bishop. In any case, it is certain that she had been consecrated to God before the year 600, as her brother Leander, who died either in the year 600 or 601, wrote for her guidance an extant work dealing with a nun's rule of life and with contempt for the world (\\"Regula sive Libellus de institutione virginum et de contemptu mundi ad Florentinam sororem\\", P.L. LXXII, 873 sqq.). In it the author lays down the rules according to which cloistered consecrated virgins should regulate their lives. He strongly advises them to avoid interaction with women living in the world, and with men, especially youths; recommends strict temperance in eating and drinking, gives advice concerning the reading of and meditation on Holy Scripture, enjoins equal love and friendship for all those living together in community, and exhorts his sister earnestly to remain true to her holy state. Florentina regulated her life according to the advice of her brother, entered with fervour into the spirit of the religious life, and was honoured as a saint after her death. Her younger brother Isidore also dedicated to her his work \\"De fide catholica contra Jud√¶os\\", which he wrote at her request. Florentina died early in the seventh century and is venerated as the patroness of the diocese of Plasencia. Her feast falls on 20 June. The name is written Florentia in the Roman martyrology, but Florentina is without doubt the correct form. An important part of her bones was buried in the cathedral of Murcia (Spain), where are venerated nowadays. However, the biggest part of her remains are preserved in Berzocana (Spain), where she is venerated as well as her brother Fulgentius.

A branch to Beith was also built. It was formed by extending the earlier independent Glasgow, Barrhead and Neilston Direct Railway, which is also described here; that line was taken over by the joint company. The main line between Glasgow and Kilmarnock continues in operation at the present day. The station at Neilston was closed, and the locality is served by a different line. History =Glasgow, Barrhead and Neilston Direct Railway= The Glasgow, Barrhead and Neilston Direct Railway (GB&NDR;) was authorised on 4 August 1845 to build its line of nine miles (15 km) with a capital of ¬£150,000. It was to run from a terminal on the south side of Glasgow to Crofthead, near Neilston. The location was the centre of several local industries, in the valley of the Cowdon Burn, on the Ayr Road below Neilston. Two short branches, to Thornliebank, and to Househill were authorised in the following year, with an additional ¬£35,000 capital. =A Glasgow terminal= The Glasgow terminal was somewhat remote from the city‚ÄîGlasgow Bridge carried a toll at this time‚Äîbut a small railway company could ill afford a central terminus. Many early railways had been simply a means to move coal and other heavy minerals from a pit to a waterway. By the 1840s it was evident that they had a more strategic role, and in 1846 a Royal Commission deliberated on the desirable location of passenger and goods terminals to serve the city of Glasgow and the quays on the Clyde. The Caledonian Railway CR had just been authorised (in 1845) and planned to get access to the city over the route of the Garnkirk and Glasgow Railway (by now transformed into the Glasgow, Garnkirk and Coatbridge Railway) which terminated at Townhead, in the north- east margin of the city. Taking a strategic view the CR hoped to get authorisation for a more central terminal, and it collaborate with the GB&NDR; to promote a passenger terminal in the city centre. Together they proposed the Glasgow Southern Terminal Railway, which would be located near St Enoch's Square, crossing the Clyde near Glasgow Bridge. It got as far as an authorising Act of Parliament, on 16 July 1846, but the details were left subject to approval by various authorities. In fact the Admiralty demanded a swing bridge for the Clyde crossing, and combined with other opposition, the scheme faced too much obstruction, and was reduced to the construction of a terminal station called South Side, in the angle of Pollokshaws Road and Cathcart Street. The Glasgow Southern Terminal Railway was absorbed by the GB&NDR; by Act of Parliament of 2 July 1847, which also authorised a deviation of the route. The CR also obtained authority to lease the GB&NDR; line. =The Caledonian interest= At this period the Ardrossan Railway had grand plans to reach Glasgow from Ardrossan, where the 12th Earl of Eglinton had expended considerable sums improving the harbour; the Ardrossan Railway was largely sponsored by him. Its natural enemy was the Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway (GPK&AR;), which was building in that part of Ayrshire, and the Ardrossan company had purchased large quantities of GB&NDR; shares, \\"to stop the Glasgow and Ayr swamping it\\".Statement by Lord Eglinton, quoted in Ross, page 56. If the Ardrossan company was hostile to the GPK&AR;, then the Caledonian was a friend of the Ardrossan. A physical link between the GB&NDR; and the Ardrossan company had been suggested, and the Caledonian calculated that possession of the GB&NDR; would give it access to much of Ayrshire, beating off the GPK&AR.;The GPK&AR; formed the Glasgow and South Western Railway (G&SWR;) in 1850. In 1846 the Ardrossan Company had obtained Parliamentary authority to build a line from Crofthead, intended terminus of the GB&NDR;, and Kilwinning and Kilmarnock. =The GB&NDR; opens= GB&NDR; system in 1848The GB&NDR; opened its line as far a Barrhead terminus on 27 September 1848; the station was in the Grahamston district below the town, and on the north-west side of the Water of Levern. The Glasgow station was South Side. =Lease finalised= The 1847 Act had merely authorised the lease by the Caledonian; the terms had to be negotiated, and these were being finalised by a further Act of 1 August 1849, by which time the CR had succeeded in reducing its financial commitment to the original GB&NDR; shareholders; even so the outlay was ¬£16,500 on a 999-year lease; \\"receipts were barely enough to cover the working costs\\". =South Side station= On 1 June 1849 the Clydesdale Junction Railway CJR was completed, terminating at South Side station. The CJR was effectively under the control of the Caledonian Railway, and trains to and from England now used the station. From 10 September 1849 trains from the Hamilton line also used the station. In that year the station was rebuilt to a design of William Tite; although cramped, the facade was imposing. =Extending to Kilmarnock= In 1865 the G&SWR; promoted a Bill to build a line from Kilmarnock to Glasgow via Stewarton‚Äîthe direct route which the citizens of Kilmarnock had wanted from the GBK&AR; at the outset. The Caledonian responded with a Bill to extend the Glasgow Barrhead and Neilston Direct Railway, which they leased and worked, from Crofthead (i.e. Neilston) to Kilmarnock. Both these schemes obtained Parliamentary authority. The lines would be closely parallel, and at this time the respective shareholders strenuously made it clear that the duplicate expenditure was wasteful. At first the compromise was that the two routes would converge at Stewarton, continuing as a single route to the G&SWR; station at Kilmarnock. In fact the proposals were held in suspense for some time, until in the 1869 session a Bill was put forward merging the schemes entirely: the rival companies agreed to build the line jointly from Crofthead to Kilmarnock. This was authorised by a fresh Act of Parliament on 12 July 1869, which cancelled the two earlier Acts. The line was to be called the Glasgow, Barrhead and Kilmarnock Joint Line. The G&SWR; had already constructed a short length northwards from Kilmarnock, and now extended that to make an end on junction with the GB&NDR; line at Neilston. By then a new station had been opened at Neilston, on 27 March 1871, forming the temporary southern extremity of the GB&NDR; line. GB&KJR; system in 1873The line between Barrhead and Neilston was closed temporarily from 1 May 1870 to enable the doubling of the line; the new Neilston station was located a short distance on the Kilmarnock side of the former location. The 1869 Act had authorised building a short connecting line from near South Side to the City of Glasgow Union Railway, which had been authorised in 1863, so as to enable G&SWR; trains on the Kilmarnock line to reach the planned St Enoch (passenger) and College (goods) terminals. The Act included a clause imposing a penalty of ¬£60,000 if the through line were not ready by 28 June 1872. In fact the deadline was not met: the line was opened only as far as Stewarton on 27 March 1871. An Act of 25 July 1872 removed the penalty as well as clarifying the City Union line connection. The through route was opened on 26 June 1873. As well as the line from Glasgow to Kilmarnock, there was a branch to Beith from Barrmill, opened on the same day. However the Glasgow terminal remained the awkwardly located South Side station: the connection towards St Enoch was not ready. The former Glasgow, Barrhead and Neilston Direct Railway company was bought out. The new route was difficult to operate: \\"a veritable switchback\\" with 3¬Ω miles (5 km) of 1 in 67-70 on Neilston bank. The G&SWR; discontinued its passenger service from South Side station towards Kilmarnock on 1 September 1877. Rationalisation While Glasgow commuting built up in the 1960s, the outer limit of frequent passenger train services was Barrhead. The Neilston station on the line was closed, as the alternative line to Neilston High was electrified. The East Kilbride line, branching from the Kilmarnock line at Busby Junction, assumed greater importance as the housing construction there developed. The track between Barrhead and Kilmarnock was singled as part of the rationalisation of the route in the mid 1970s following the electrification of the West Coast Main Line, with a passing loop at Lugton. However, in 2009 the section between and Lugton was redoubled, forming a dynamic loop, as part of capacity improvements between Glasgow and Kilmarnock. The section from Strathbungo Junction to Cumberland Street Junction, by which trains reached the City Union Line from 1873, was closed beyond Langside Junction in 1973 and lifted (the remainder is still in use for freight). The line to Beith closed to passengers on 5 November 1962 and to freight two years later. In 1968 the severity of rationalisation was such that the line was to be closed, and trains diverted via Paisley and Dalry‚Äîthe original GPK&AR; route. In the event this was not done, and the Dalry - Kilmarnock route closed. Current operations The main line is open and carries (2015) a typically half-hourly passenger service running from Glasgow to Barrhead and then all stations to Kilmarnock; in addition a half-hourly service runs from Glasgow Central to Barrhead, calling at all stations. There is a limited Sunday service.Scotrail publicity At Lugton, there is a goods-only branch line to Barrmill Munitions Depot; however the rail facility is dormant. The route uses the first part of the Beith branch as far as Barrmill, then continuing on the former Lanarkshire and Ayrshire Railway route.

His expansion of this work, in two volumes, was at first encouraged by Rev. R. S. Hawker and then the cause of a great quarrel. John Blight's second patron, James Halliwell, was similarly unhelpful, never paying him for his vast labour in illustrating Halliwell's projected edition of William Shakespeare's Works. In the mid-1860s, Blight had a mental breakdown and was incarcerated for the remainder of his life in Bodmin Mental Asylum. Blight's recording of Cornish antiquities includes many that no longer exist. His descriptions and illustrations of them provide a most valuable source for archaeologists and local historians.

Centered on Broad and Pearl Streets west of Main Street, the area was developed residential in response to local economic development intended to revitalize the city, whose port was in decline. The district includes the city's largest concentration of Greek Revival houses, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Description and history Middletown developed in the 18th century as a major port on the Connecticut River, but was in decline by the 1830s. Community leaders revitalized the local economy by founding Wesleyan University in 1831, and investing in textile and machine industries. The Wesleyan campus was laid out west of High Street, and the area between it and Main Street, originally open land used mainly for gardening, was developed residentially. Although there had been some houses built during the Federal period, the amount of housing stock in this area tripled between 1830 and 1850. The area was substantially built out by 1900, with only relatively minor additions and alterations since then. The historic district is bounded on the north and south by Broad and Church Streets, and the west by High Street, and generally does not include buildings on those streets.

Biography Born in New York, Hale's family moved to Colorado in 1865. He graduated at head of the first class from Denver East High School in 1877. He enrolled at West Point in 1880, and graduated at the head of his class four years later. His final score was 2070.4 points out of a possible 2075, which was the highest ever from the United States Military Academy. Hale pursued studies in electrical engineering following his commission as a second lieutenant, but eventually resigned from the regular army to take a position with General Electric. Still living in Denver, Hale joined the state militia in 1897 as their lieutenant-colonel. The First Colorado, like many other state militias, was sworn into service at the beginning of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in April, 1898, with Irving Hale in command. The Colorados were sent to the Philippines, along with other militias from western states. The First Colorado secured the American left flank during the Battle of Manila, capturing Fort San Agustin, and raising the first American flag over the city's fortifications; his excellent leadership secured Hale a promotion to the rank of brigadier general of volunteers in command of the 2d Brigade, 2d Division, Eighth Army Corps. During the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War, Hale led troops into battle on several occasions, and was wounded while scouting an enemy position during the battle of Meycauayan on March 26, 1899. He later received a Silver Star for his leadership near Calumpit on April 25, 1899. Though offered a position in the new volunteer army, Hale decided to return home with the state militias in the fall, and was honorably mustered out on October 1, 1899, returning to his civilian career as an electrical engineer. Following the war, he was active as one of the founders of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. On September 29, 1911, Hale suffered a paralytic stroke from which he never fully recovered. He died on July 26, 1930, and is buried in Denver's Fairmount Cemetery. The neighborhood of Hale, Denver is named for him.

The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Description and history The district is an irregular shape that includes, or fronts onto, portions of Atkins Street, Country Club Road, Sawmill Road, and Bell Road. It includes 15 houses, of which 9 are contributing buildings, and it includes a barn that is also a contributing structure. Four of the houses date from the mid- to late 18th century and were the homes of some of the earliest settlers in this part of Middletown. These are typical Georgian style houses, wood frame structure with large central chimneys. Most of the remaining houses are either Federal or Greek Revival in their styling. The Highland neighborhood is representative of the now rare rural character of Middletown. It also has evidence of the area's success for a time as a small summer resort area. and The Highland area was settled in the early 18th century by members of the Warner, Wilcox, and Bacon families. The wide spacing of the older houses in the district is typical of building patterns in rural Middletown at the time. Although most farming families engaged in trades and crafts in addition to agriculture, those of the Wilcox family are particularly significant.

Later, in 1833-1838, he worked as a Greek Catholic priest in remote villages of Carpathian Ruthenia (present-day Zakarpattia oblast of Ukraine) and as a notary in Ungv√°r (Uzhhorod) (1838‚Äì1844). Dukhnovych started to write poems in his early years. He wrote in the Ruthenian, Russian, and Hungarian languages. His early works are said to have been influenced by Hungarian Romanticism. Dukhnovych supported education and cultural revival of Carpathian Ruthenians. He saw his role as a defender of Ruthenian culture against Magyarization. In 1850 Dukhnovych established the first Ruthenian cultural association, the Eperjes (now Pre≈°ov) Literary Society. The society under his guidance published a series of books. His most famous patriotic poem Ia rusyn byl, ies'm i budu (I Was, Am, and Will Be a Ruthenian) was published as part of an anthology in 1851. This poem would later become the national anthem of Carpatho-Ruthenians. Dukhnovych also published a number of pedagogical and religious books, elementary school textbook and a Grammar. His most famous scholarly works were The History of the Eparchy of Prja≈°ev (1877), originally published in Latin and later translated in Russian and English, and a History of Carpathian Ruthenians (1853). His last years were devoted to development of education and schooling among local Ruthenians. In an effort to forestall the Magyarization of the Ruthenian population Dukhnovych founded in Eperjes (Pre≈°ov) together with Adolf Dobryansky the St. John the Baptist Society (1862). On March 30, 1865 Dukhnovych died in Eperjes (Pre≈°ov). Assessment Dukhnovych is regarded to be one of the outstanding Ruthenian humanists and educators. In the words of Ivan Franko \\"he made everything so that forgotten Ruthenians revived spiritually\\".litopys.org.ua - Oleksandr Dukhnovych His views were based on Christian principles and idealism. Dukhnovych also actively participated in the Russophile movement in the territory of today's Western Ukraine at the end of the 19th century. Even though Dukhnovych wrote in the local language he did not believe it to be a separate language nor did he wish to contribute to a creation of a literary language of Carpathian Ruthenians. Instead Dukhnovych wrote his scholarly works in a peculiar dialect called iazychie made of Church-Slavonic and local Lemko-Rusyn.

They spoke the Locrian dialect, a Doric-Northwest dialect, and were closely related to their neighbouring tribes, the Phocians and the Dorians. They were divided into two geographically distinct tribes, the western Ozolians and the eastern Opuntians; their primary towns were Amphissa and Opus respectively, and their most important colony was the city of Epizephyrian Locris in Magna Graecia, which still bears the name \\"Locri\\". Among others, Ajax the Lesser and Patroclus were the most famous Locrian heroes, both distinguished in the Trojan War; Zaleucus from Epizephyrian Locris devised the first written Greek law code, the Locrian code. Mythology In Greek mythology, the Locrians were the descendants of Locrus, great-grandson of Deucalion and Pyrrha, the founders of the Greek race. According to some traditions, Deucalion was a native of the Locrian city of Opus,Pind. Ol. ix. 63, seq.; Strab. ix. p. 425. thus the Locrians are said to have been the first tribe to be called \\"Hellenes\\". Some ancient writers supposed the name of the Locrians to be derived from an ancient king of the Leleges,Aristot.; Hes. ap. Strabo vii. p. 322; Scymnus Ch. 590; Dicaearch. 71; Plin. iv. 7. s. 12. the prehistoric residents of Locris, named Locrus, and Dionysius of Halicarnassus mention that \\"Locrians\\" is the later name of the Leleges,Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Roman Antiquities, Book 1, 17, online at LacusCurtius in the way that many ancient writers inaccurately identified several Greek tribes with the aboriginal peoples of Greece. It is argued that the word \\"locros\\" means \\"branch\\" and that the \\"Locrians\\" was not a specific nation but the various \\"branches\\", ie the tribes, participating in an alliance / amphictyony. H. Harissis \\"Pindar's Paean 8 and the birth of the myth of the first temples of Delphi\\" Acta Classica 62, pp 78 ‚Äì123 (2019) History and distribution The Locrians are said to have arrived in southern Greece in the late 2nd millennium BC from their homeland on Pindus, when the Greek tribes moved southwards. In historical times, the Locrians were divided into two distinct tribes, differing from each other in customs, habits and civilization. Of these, the eastern Locrians, called the Opuntian and Epicnemedian, dwelt on the eastern coast of Greece, opposite the island of Euboea, while the western Locrians, called Ozolian or Esperian, dwelt on the Corinthian gulf and were separated from the former by Mount Parnassus and the whole of Doris and Phocis.Strab. ix. p. 425. It is likely that Locrian territory once extended from sea to sea, then was divided as a result of the immigration of the Phocians and Dorians.Niebuhr, Lectures on Ancient Ethnography, vol. i. p. 123. The most famous colony of the Locrian tribe was the city of Epizephyrian Locri, founded in the 7th century BC in Magna Gr√¶cia, which exists until today as Locri. According to Strabo the founders were the Ozolian Locrians, from the region of Amphissa. In the 6th century BC, the Locrians had a series of conflicts with the neighbouring tribes. Only the Opuntian Locrians are mentioned by Homer; they were the more ancient and the more civilized. The Ozolian Locrians, who are said to have been a colony of the former, are not mentioned in history until the time of the Peloponnesian War, and are even then represented as a semi-barbarous people.Thuc. i. 5. That was the last mention of the Ozolian Locrians, as they suffered the defeat from Corinth later and they stopped having a distinct identity in the 4th century BC. The Opuntian Locrians, who are mentioned to have taken part in the battle of Thermopylae between the Greeks and the Persians, were attacked by various tribes which devastated their country and only some of their towns preserved the Locrian identity in the 3rd century BC. Culture The Locrians around Thermopylae were the first to have been called Hellenes. Later the name expanded to include the other Greek tribes through the Amphictionia of Delphi, to which they belonged, and their religion. The most famous of their heroes were Ajax the Locrian, best known as Ajax the Lesser, son of Oileus; and Patroclus, son of Menoetius and best friend of Achilles. Elements of Ajax worship have been found in Euboea, Pontus, the Aegean islands, Asia Minor, Peloponnesus, Kerkyra, Epirus, southern Italy, and northern Africa; which means that the Locrian civilization was widely extended in the ancient Greek world. In Greek mythology, the Locrians are closely related to the Phocians and Eleans. James M. Redfield, professor of Classics at the University of Chicago, in his book The Locrian Maidens: Love and Death in Greek Italy, states that the Locrians of Epizephyrian Locri had a special way to treat the sex difference. Although the Locrians hardly viewed men and women as equals, women held special religious rights, which men could gain access to only by marrying them. Locrian women became the vehicles for the transmission of status, and marriage maintained the social order of a traditional oligarchy. Ajax the Lesser Ajax raping Cassandra from the Palladium. Side A of an Attic black-figure amphora, ca. 540 BC. From Vulci. The national hero of the Locrians was Ajax the Locrian, who led the 40 Locrian ships to Troy,Homer, Iliad, Book II, verses 494‚Äì760, PP Il.2.494 to take part in the Trojan War. Locrians respected him so much, that after his death they kept a place for him in their phalanx, thinking that he will always fight with them. On the other side, Ajax's actions resulted in his death according to Greek mythology, while the Locrian tribe suffered from the anger of the gods. After the fall of Troy, he raped Cassandra in the temple of Athena, where she had taken refuge as a supplicant. For this crime, Poseidon wrecked the ship of Ajax on the coast of Euboea and Ajax was killed by a lightning bolt. =The curse= According to Lycophron, in his work Alexandra, for this crime of their national hero, the Locrians had to send two unmarried maidens to the temple of Athena at Ilion of Athens for 1,000 years, where they should live until they died. After their death, they would not be given a decent burial, while for each maiden who died, another one must be sent into the temple by night, and she would be stoned to death if seen. The goddess is referred to as \\"Athena Ilias\\", a name not necessarily derived from Ilion, but maybe from the family deity Oileus, the father of Ajax and the ancestral hero of the Locrians. She could have protected the maidens during their period of initiation Callimachus mentions that the curse fell upon Locris three years after the Trojan war, which led to the beginning of the tribute at the command of the Delphic oracle. According to Apollodorus,Apollodorus, E.6.20-22. after the command of the Delphic oracle, two maidens were sent to Ilion, and their duty was to clean the temple. After their death, they were replaced, while the tribute ended after a thousand years with the end of the Phocian War, which destroyed Naryca, the town that supplied the maidens. Aelian says that the plague, fell upon Locris after the Locrians failed to send the yearly tribute that the oracle demanded.Aelian, Fr. 47. Demetrius of Scepsis knows that the maidens were sent for the first time \\"when the Persians were already in control\\", so after 547 BC. Locrian maidens had the appearance of a Greek mourner, as they went to Ilion barefoot, wearing only one garment and their hair was loose or cut. Cut hair symbolizes maturity for both sexes and plays a part in marriage rituals, while loosened or cut hair are required in other cults such as to Demeter and Dionysus, and bare feet in other as well. In addition to these, loosened hair and bare feet are signs of a witch. These maidens were not given proper burials, as most of them were burnt on a pyre of barren branches and the ashes were thrown to the sea. This kind of pyre was used in Greece to burn criminals and the barren trees were used to burn portents and prodigies, while criminals were hanged from these trees. Locrian maidens were seen as marginal beings and scapegoats, separated from normal life, a feature of rites of passage. The three stages of rites of passage are separation, marginalization and reincorporation, and according to this, the maidens left for Ilion, spent a year there and returned home. In Epizephyrian Locri, maidens were prostituted as a reminder and punishment for a certain act. Ancient basis for prostitution was that girls would marry earlier than their coevals and foreigners would complete the rites. The completion of the rites enhances the status of girls. In the middle of the 6th century, this cult became more epic focused and centered on the expiation for the crimes of Ajax. As a result, later generations forgot its significance and put an end to this tribute; but a Greek inscription, discovered in Locris at the end of the nineteenth century, proves that the Locrians continued to send out pairs of maidens until the 3rd century BC.Agreement to Provide Locrian Maidens at attalus.org.

Roussel is best known as the controversial former co-trustee of his eldest child's famous fortune and for having been involved in a number of legal entanglements with the four Greek trustees of that fortune. These disputes were mostly ended (or quieted) in 1999 by the court-ordered transfer of the administration of Athina's trust to a private auditing firm.  Early life and background  Thierry Patrick Fran√ßois Roussel was born on 16 February 1953 in Neuilly-sur-Seine, Hauts-de-Seine, near Paris, the son of the late Henry Julien Gaston Roussel, who was President and General Manager of the Roussel Uclaf Laboratoires Pharmaceutiques, and his wife, Francine Grinda, daughter of Jean-Paul Grinda and niece of the French politician √âdouard Grinda. Roussel graduated from high school in 1972. He studied economics at Panth√©on-Assas University. He has two sisters: Patricia Roussel and Christine Roussel, the duchess of Luynes (widow of Jean d'Albert, 12th duc de Luynes). His maternal uncles are the veteran Davis Cup tennis player Jean-No√´l Grinda and Olivier Grinda. The Roussel family's fortunes derive from the Roussel Uclaf pharmaceutical corporation, most famous in the US for the design of the abortifacient RU-486 (mifepristone).  First marriage  Roussel married Christina Onassis in 1984. They had a honeymoon in the Caribbean, but their marriage ended in divorce in 1987. Generally, the story is reported the same way, with the strong suggestion that theirs was a marriage based rather on convenience or infatuation than true love. Whatever the truth, there were certainly serious marital problems. Roussel had at least one extramarital affair during the marriage, with former Swedish model Marianne \\"Gaby\\" Landhage, who gave birth to their elder two (of three) children while Roussel was still married to Christina. In fact he has a son with Gaby who is only a few months younger than his daughter Athina (by Christina). For Christina's part, she suffered from bouts of serious depression and allegedly self- medicated with drugs and overeating.Klein, Edward: \\"The Battle Over the Golden Child,\\" Vanity Fair, November 1997. Gage, Nicholas: \\"The Last Onassis,\\" Vanity Fair, May 2005. In any case, Christina and Roussel began divorce proceedings eight months after Athina was born.  Second marriage  Roussel married Marianne \\"Gaby\\" Landhage in 1990 in the village church in Villeny near Bonneville, the Roussels' estate in Sologne. Athina Roussel was a bridal attendant. By then Athina was in her father's custody. Roussel and Gaby now have three children: Erik, Sandrine, and Johanna. The two older children were born during Roussel's marriage to Christina‚ÄîErik in July 1985, and Sandrine in May 1987. Johanna was born in July 1991.  Business career  = Business interests = Roussel formed his first company at the age of 22 and went on establishing publicity space rental companies such as; AEA, Super-m√©dia and M√©dia Center (sold to the Carat Group). He formed the financial management company SGFC in 1987 whereas he is claimed to remain President https://in.kompass.com/c/sgfc-societe-de-gestion-financiere-et-commerciale- sa/ch074973/ Uncertain if this is the firm but could not find other, searched 08 Feb 2020.

His daughters' (Athina and Sandrine) are known to be competitive show jumpers. = The Onassis legacy = Christina Onassis never trusted Thierry Roussel completely, which led the family to arrange for a Board of Administrators to control the family's money until Athina came of age. The trustees Christina selected to manage Athina's estate in the event of Christina's death were Stelio Papadimitriou, Paul Ioannidis, Apostolos Zabelas, Theodore Gabrielides, and Thierry Roussel. The \\"four Greeks\\" were frequently dubbed in the media as the \\"greybeards\\".Klein, Edward (November 1997). \\"The Battle Over the Golden Girl\\". Vanity Fair. During Athina's childhood and adolescence, all expenditures made on her behalf by her father, funded by Onassis inheritance, had to be approved by the Board in advance. This led to Roussel threatening to move back to Paris, France, where income taxes would cost the estate a \\"small fortune a year\\". In 1999, a Vaduz court ordered the management of Athina's inheritance transferred from the Board to the KPMG Fides auditing firm in Lucerne. = Strawberries in Portugal = The most legendary failed investment is claimed to be a strawberry farm in Portugal. Some reports, like the Athens News Agency in 1998, say the result was bankruptcy. Diane Sawyer investigated the situation in doing research for her interview with Athina in 1998, and according to Sawyer, although Roussel did not actually file for bankruptcy, he did sell the strawberry farms at a loss. According to Forbes, it was a US $30 million loss. Roussel used his company, Oderfruta, to invest in the farms, with a borrowed subsidy from the European Union, funding from the Portuguese state and an unknown bank. By 1994, the venture was badly debt-ridden.

Biography Peter Kappesser enlisted in the Army from Syracuse, New York on August 31, 1862. He received the Medal of Honor by the Secretary of War for the capture of a Confederate battle flag from Walthall's Mississippi Brigade of the 34th Mississippi Infantry at The Battle of Lookout Mountain, Tennessee on November 24, 1863. The Battle of Lookout Maintain was part of the Third Battle of Chattanooga. Private Peter Kappesser was one of twenty men cited for personal valor in the fighting in and around Chattanooga, Tennessee, November 24 & 25, 1863. On November 24 he was one of four men of the 149th New York Infantry Regiment to earn the award for his valor at Lookout Mountain, where he captured a battle flag of Bragg's army, (Confederate States of America). Private Kappesser's company surprised a Confederate camp at breakfast and the enemy color sergeant and his color guard attempted to retreat under cover of nearby rocks. Private Kappesser boldly rushed their position, demanding their surrender, and taking their flag. He tore the flag from its staff, thrust the bunting under his coat, and then returned to the battle in order to reach a wounded comrade and carry him from the battlefield. In the cold of that night, Private Kappesser used his captured Confederate flag as a scarf around his neck, then continued to do so until the end of the battle at Missionary Ridge, whereupon he gave the flag to the commander of his regiment. The Confederate battle flag, as described by Lt. Colonel C.B. Randall in his Commander's Report of the action, was \\"...3 feet and 2 inches in length, 2 feet 8 inches in width, white border 1¬Ω inches deep, dark blue ground-work, with round white center 14¬Ω inches in diameter\\". Kappesser mustered out with his regiment in June 1865. After the war he was a member of the William Lilly Post of the GAR, Syracuse, New York, and served as its Quartermaster. He is buried at Woodlawn Cemetery in Syracuse, New York near the area reserved for the William Lilly GAR (Grand Army of the Republic) Post. Historical Note: During the Civil War, the uniquely German immigrant Company B of the New York 149th, to which Kappesser was assigned, took part in the following battles and actions: Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, Wauhatchie, Lookout Mountain, Ringgold, Resaca, New Hope Church, Lost Mountain, Pine Knob, Kennesaw Mountain, Peach Tree Creek and the siege of Savannah; and they were present at the battles of Missionary Ridge, Rocky Face Ridge, Averasboro, Bentonville and The Carolinas. In total they lost 133 dead and 353 wounded. Obituary Newspaper obituary in Syracuse, New York dated June 2, 1930: \\"Peter Kappesser, Holder of Medal of Honor, Dies After Operation\\". He died of appendicitis at age 91 on May 31, 1930. At the time of his death, he was the last surviving Civil War veteran of the 149th Infantry, Co. B, in Syracuse.

The early uniform being black trousers/skirt, white shirt, grey jumper and black blazer. The town crest appearing on the Blazer pocket. A tie of blue with bright yellow and red stripes was also mandatory, an identical tie was also occasionally worn by Larry Hagman in the 1980s TV Series Dallas. From a peak student population in 1980, year numbers gradually declined and many temporary and duplicated structures were closed and demolished. These included the temporary class rooms to the South of West lawn, the Secondary modern external toilet block and drama blocks (at either end of the West Lawn 'top' playground) and the Special needs building. In the late 1980s the name was changed to Teignmouth Community College. Curriculum Core subjects follow the National Curriculum with sixth form pupils following A-level, AS-level and BTEC courses.

Born in Seville, Spain, he was descended from a long line of flamenco artists including Enrique Ortega (father and son) and Curro Dulce, and he was possibly related to and El Fillo. The family was also known for its bull fighters. Under the stage name El Caracol,Caracol signifies a \\"snail\\" or the \\"spiral\\" shape of its shell, as in escalera de caracol (\\"spiral staircase\\"). he \\"gained international fame as much for his flamboyant personality as for his extraordinary cante.\\"D. E. Pohren, Lives and Legends of Flamenco (Madrid: Society of Spanish Studies 1988) at 146. Later his juergas (days long flamenco parties) became notorious. Although as a singer he always retained the ability to deliver the core of the traditional art, he was not ashamed to commercialize flamenco to attract a mass popularity; then he gained fame and fortune, as well as adding to a checkered reputation. For the most part, this was during what was later widely known as a decadent age in the history of the art, the age of √ìpera flamenca.Pohren, Lives and Legends of Flamenco (Madrid 1988) at 146‚Äì150.Cf., √Ångel √Ålvarez Caballero, El cante flamenco (Madrid: Alianza Editorial 1998) at 275‚Äì285, Cap√≠tulo XXVII, \\"Manolo Caracol: ¬øun hereodoxo?\\" and at 229‚Äì244, Cap√≠tulo XXIII, \\"La √ìpera Flamenca\\". In 1922 as a youth, he had been awarded the first prize (shared with El Tenazas) at the Concurso de Cante Jondo de Granada, organized by intellectuals like Manuel de Falla and Federico Garc√≠a Lorca. However, in the first stage of his career, he made a living singing mostly at private parties, which at the time, were, together with caf√©s, the usual stages for flamenco artists. During the Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì1939), he started touring with theatre companies as: owing to the war, private parties were difficult to find. This kind of theatre show, very common at the time (see √≥pera flamenca) was a musical with commonplace love stories set in Andalusian or gypsy context and their musical pieces were usually a mixture of Spanish popular song called Copla andaluza or canci√≥n espa√±ola. In 1943, he met Lola Flores, with whom he started an intense professional and emotional relationship. They became the most popular artistic couple in Spain during the forties, spreading their fame even to several Spanish American countries. His most popular songs in the field of copla andaluza, which he used to call zambra, date from that time: songs like La salvaora and La ni√±a de fuego became immensely famous in Spain. He also took part in several films such as Un caballero famoso (1942), Embrujo (1946), Jack el Negro (1950) and La ni√±a de la venta (1950). Although sometimes criticized by a very orthodox section of the flamenco public (mainly because of his facet as a singer of copla andaluza, a style which purists consider spurious, but also because of the irregularity of his performances), he is usually considered as one of the singers that better represent 'Duende' (a typical flamenco term which basically means \\"inspiration\\"). He possessed a deep, earthy, yet warm voice, and delivered the flamenco cantes (songs) with passion, originality, and extremely personal phrasing. He excelled in a wide variety of flamenco styles, including Martinetes, Seguiriyas, Sole√°, Malague√±as (especially in the style of el Mellizo), Buler√≠as and Fandangos, among others. His renderings of Fandangos, in particular, were so personal that they have come to be known as Fandangos Caracoleros. Caracol died in a road accident in Madrid, Spain.  Critics' reviews  √Ålvarez Caballero: \\"It's true that Manolo Caracol could sink to the lowest levels, real slumps in which his singing was just a parody of itself, but this often happens to cantaores of his type, who are motivated by emotional impulse, and the knowing flamenco fan knows that this can happen. From a regular singer like Mairena we can expect he will always sing well; From somebody like Caracol (...) you could expect anything: either he was a disaster or he was an absolute genius. (√Ångel √Ålvarez Caballero, El cante flamenco, 1998) Anselmo Gonz√°lez Climent: \\"With Caracol, it is impossible to remain emotionally detached (...), from the first line, since the \\"temple\\" itself he starts running through our sensibility and invades us thoroughly. He forces us to take part until our egos are suppressed.\\" (quoted by √Ålvarez Caballero in La discograf√≠a ideal del flamenco, 1995) Ricardo Molina about Caracol's anthology Una historia del cante flamenco: \\"From the ca√±a to the group of Malague√±as (flamenco style), this anthology is an evil personification of Caracol messing up the definite forms of the past.\\" (quoted by √Ålvarez Caballero in La discograf√≠a ideal del flamenco, 1995)  Recordings  As happens with most flamenco artists of the past, Caracol's discography is in complete disorder. His recordings are regularly republished, but in different compilations, sometimes in careless remasterizations, by different record companies. Una historia del cante flamenco, originally published by Hispavox in 1958 with guitarist Melchor de Marchena remains his most seminal work. It was republished, together with other recordings, in the compilation El genio: Manolo Caracol in the Quej√≠o CD collection published by Hispavox and compiled by J.M. Gamboa .

When Dong Zhuo's loyalists Li Jue and Guo Si rebelled against the new government, Wang sent Hu Zhen with Yang Ding () and Xu Rong to fight, or perhaps negotiate, with the rebels. However, Hu Zhen and Yang Ding joined the enemy soon after Xu Rong was killed in battle. When Li Jue and Guo Si took over the capital Chang'an from Wang Yun, Hu Zhen became the Colonel-Director of Retainers () under their command. With his position, he falsely convicted a local officer You Yin (), with whom he quarrelled, and put You Yin to death. A few months later Hu Zhen became ill, saying You Yin's spirit had come for his crime, and died.

Raymond is the author of the book, How to Rig an Election: Confessions of a Republican Operative (2008). Phone jamming scandal Raymond told investigators that his former Republican National Committee colleague James Tobin approached him with a plan to tie up the phones of New Hampshire Democrats on Election Day 2002, during a close Senate race between Republican John E. Sununu and Democrat Jeanne Shaheen. At the time, Raymond owned a Virginia-based GOP phone-bank company (GOP Marketplace) and also held a paid position as Executive Director of the Republican Leadership Council. Raymond then collected $15,600 from the New Hampshire Republican State Committee and paid a small Idaho telemarketing company $2,300 to make non-stop hangup phone calls to six New Hampshire phone lines, five of which were being used by the Democratic Party to get out the vote. The sixth phone line belonged to the Manchester Firefighters' Union, which offers free rides to the polls. In an interview with the Boston Globe, Raymond said he took part in the phone-jamming because he \\"had been reluctant to turn down a prominent official of the RNC, fearing that would cost him future opportunities from an organization that was becoming increasingly ruthless.\\" How to Rig an Election The closing paragraph of his book How to Rig an Election: Confessions of a Republican Operative ends with a line that reflects on a conversation with his wife just before he entered jail; \\"After ten full years inside the GOP, ninety days amongst honest criminals wasn't any great ordeal.\\"How to Rig an Election: Confessions of a Republican Operative () Media appearances * Appeared on Real Time with Bill Maher on October 24, 2008, talking about his book * Appeared on The Daily Show January 17, 2008 * Appeared on The Rachel Maddow Show on January 27, 2009 Books * How to Rig an Election: Confessions of a Republican Operative ().

Written by The Goodies, with songs and music by Bill Oddie. Plot The Minister of Sport asks the Goodies to represent Britain at the forthcoming Winter Olympics. When they ask for directions to their training headquarters, the Minister gives them an unusual map (a tall thin cactus) to guide them. Riding their trandem, blindfolded, they follow the contours of their 'cactus map' to their destination, where they find their headquarters is a tiny shed in Bognor. Their sporting equipment is also very meagre and very old and unusual. There is no room in the shed for both training benches and beds, and the Goodies discover that the benches double as beds. A massage is provided by mechanical means, which is very uncomfortable, and the oil for the massage is provided by oil cans with dark-coloured oil. Tim learns to ski on two planks of wood, being towed, on the road, by a rope behind the Goodies trandem. With another unusual 'map' (this time a kettle) to guide them, the Goodies travel to the British team's igloo quarters. When the Goodies arrive at the North Pole, where the Games are to be held, they are feeling extremely cold, but the sight of the beautiful Eskimo Nell warms them up. Meals are very unappetising and boring. The Goodies are unsure how they would go in competition in the slippery and cold icy conditions, so they capture a butterfly and strap a sunlamp to it to give themselves a better chance. With the butterfly fluttering away, the steady beam of the sunlamp causes the ice and snow to melt. In the resultant extremely hot conditions, the competitors from other countries flounder, while the Goodies win many medals. After the Goodies' triumphant return home, they find that extreme climatic changes have suddenly occurred, with unexpected results.

It is in the Adelaide Hills Council area. At the 2006 census, Oakbank had a population of 473.  History  The town was founded in about 1840 by Scottish brothers James and Andrew Johnston. The Johnstons had come out to South Australia on the East Indiaman Buckinghamshire in 1839, and by the following year were opening up the country in the Onkaparinga Valley near the present site of the township. The Johnston family hailed from Oakbank, Scotland district, and hence decided to name the new township Oakbank. A large oak tree that still stands in the main street of the town was reportedly grown from an acorn carried to Australia by one of the brothershttp://www.ahc.sa.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=1254#O James and Andrew Johnston founded the J. & A.G. Johnston brewery in 1845, tapping an underground spring fed by the Onkaparinga River. A second brewery was built by Henry Pike in 1889, which he named the Dorset Brewery. Both breweries were forced to shut down in 1938 due to a virus in the yeast, and therefore both turned to making soft drinks and cordials instead. Johnston's Cordial is still a popular soft drink brand, and one of South Australia's oldest family-owned businesses. The Dorset brewery site now produces hand-woven textiles. Oakbank is well known for the Oakbank Easter Racing Carnival.

Life Yuan Yi was from Ruyang County (), Runan Commandery (), which is in present-day Shangshui County, Henan. He was a second cousin of Yuan Shao, Yuan Shu and Yuan Yin (). In the early part of his official career, he held positions such as Prefect () of Chang'an and Administrator () of Shanyang (Â±±ÈôΩÈÉ°; around present-day Jinxiang County, Shandong). Yuan Yi received high praise from his contemporaries such as the scholar Zhang Chao () from Hejian Commandery () and the warlord Cao Cao. Zhang Chao, in recommending Yuan Yi as a talent to Zhu Jun, said that Yuan Yi was very well read and knowledgeable, while Cao Cao said that Yuan Yi maintained his diligence towards studying even after he had grown up. In 190, Yuan Yi, then the Administrator of Shanyang Commandery, led the troops from his commandery to join a coalition of warlords in a military campaign against the tyrannical warlord Dong Zhuo, who had been controlling the Han central government and the figurehead Emperor Xian since 189. The coalition was led by Yuan Yi's cousin Yuan Shao; another of Yuan Yi's cousins, Yuan Shu, was also a member of the coalition. The coalition broke up by 191 as its members pursued different interests, such as territorial gains. In 192, following the death of Chen Wen (), the Inspector () of Yang Province, Yuan Shao nominated Yuan Yi as the new Inspector to replace Chen Wen. At the time, Yuan Shao was in a proxy war with his half-brother Yuan Shu, who had occupied much of Yang Province. Yuan Yi was killed in Pei County while en route to Yang Province to assume office.

This is the famous theertha of the temple. It is located half a kilometre west from the main Pathi. Historically, this well plays a major role in joining the people in this part of the country, breaking the caste-based discrimination that once prevailed among them. Before and during the period of Lord Vaikundar, this part of the subcontinent was under the grip of feudalism, casteism, and untouchability. There were separate wells and tanks for each caste, and people from the other caste were not allowed to draw out water from those wells. As in the Vinchai, since the social aim of 'uplifting the lowely treated people in the society' occupies a major part in the spiritual mission of Vaikundar, which is projected towards the ideal Dharma Yukam, he wanted to stop this evil practice. So as the first step to reach this aim, this well was established at Swamithoppe. Apart from religious sacredness, this well was also a historical icon since it was the first well in this part of the country where people could use water freely, irrespective of their caste. History By the completion of the Six-year Tavam of Vaikundar in 1840, the Thuvayal Thavasu practiced at Vakaippathi and Muttappathi for about one year as they reached Swamithoppe. Several ritual practices of Ayyavazhi originated from this. Some, especially the prayers were continued as followed during the Thuvayal Thavasu period, and some were originated as per the instructions of Vaikundar. In that series, Akilathirattu speaks of that well as \\"the eighteen castes assembling in one place, and bathing from the same well\\". This refers to the prevalence of a seemingly innocuous practice of the people, gathered around Vaikundar, bathing together from the water of this well. People of different castes bathed together at this well, mindless of their social differences. Physical closeness was necessitated, mainly because of the smallness of the well. Besides bathing, they drank this water as cure for their illness. They cooked their food with the use of this water, and eat in community feast along with Vaikundar. In the course of events, the well and its water seem to have acquired religious significance to the people of Ayyavazhi. The act of bathing, drinking, and cooking the food with this water came to be repeated with a ritual fervour. People began to consider the well a sacred one, and the water as having miraculous powers to heal sickness. A couplet from the Saattu Neettolai of Arul Nool reads as \\"every one is drinking the milk of the well around which miracles are growing\\". And by this quote, it seems that Akilam itself accredits the well as a sacred one. People consider it a religious obligation to bathe and drink at least a few drops of water from this well. Many people and multiple castes congregated there to draw water for bathing and drinking. Lord Vaikuntar used the holy water from the well and the holy mud to cure the people of their illness. Social background Patham drawn from Muthirikkinaru; inner view of the well In the then Travancore society, the discriminatory laws of purity and pollution were very sensitive in places of bathing, and in acts involving the use of water. Demarcation of separate places for the different castes for bathing and drawing water, and a strict enforcement of this discriminated separation through regulations, social and political, along with a strong religious sanction, was the order of the day. As a general custom, the lower castes were prohibited from drawing water from public wells and ponds. The upper caste people had separate wells so that they could avoid the presence and pollution of the lower caste people. Those who, be it a member of the caste fold or one from outside of it, ventured to transgress these demarcated spaces were penalised with severe corporal punishments, or even eliminated unceremoniously. It was against this back ground that a ritual involving the congregation of the people from different castes around a well, bathing together, and cooking their food with the water of the same well was being performed at Swamithoppe, where Ayya Vaikundar was carrying out his mission. It was an indirect challenge to the evil system of untouchability. This cluster of ritual actions set in motion an interrogation of the system of purity and pollution, and indirectly challenged the hegemonic system of discriminated separation. The ritual boundaries that had been set on the use of water was sought to be transgressed, and the strength of the traditional indoctrination on ritual impurity implied in the exchange of water from one to another, was sought to be weakened. Miracles Palmyra leaf, used to draw water from the holy Muthirikkinaru Due to the attention focused on the well, malicious acts have been recorded where poison was twice placed into the water by some anti-ayyavazhi elements. One was during the period of Vaikundar and was noted in Akilam and another was in a recent time. It is reported that Lord Vaikundar concentrated the poison into a Sivalinga and the Sivalinga remained inside the well in the first poisoning. As per Akilathirattu, People, hearing about the poisoning reported it to Vaikundar and requested him to save them. Vaikundar informed the devotees that the water in the well was non-poisonous. People who had faith in his words drank and bathed in the well and were totally safe. Those who had no belief in his words and had drunk the water became unconscious. People rushed to the Lord and narrated the incident. Lord asked them to sprinkle the holy water on those who were unconscious. They got up as if from sleep. Then on 17 September 1994, the first Sunday of the Tamil Month, Puratasi, poison was mixed up in the sacred water of Muthirikkinaru for the second time. Some miscreants immersed a 5-kilogram packet of Phorate, a highly poisonous chemical, into the well. There was a smell of this chemical everywhere around the well. Some advised the devotees not to bathe in the well. But, nobody heeded it; thousands of people bathed in and drank the water. Even six-month-old babies were bathed here, but nobody was affected. The empty packet of the chemical was later retrieved and destroyed. As a ritual and religious symbol This well is treated with more importance because it is attached to the incarnational activities of Vaikundar. To overcome the three diversities, Anava, Kanma, and Maya, one should achieve spiritual cleanliness, and it is believed that this cleanliness is obtained when one bathes from this sacred well. This well is said to be sealed by Vaikundar and will remain as an icon for the destruction of Kali. Even today the well is too crowded to bathe. People drink this water as Patham. It is believed that the holy water from this well will process one for the life of Dharma Yukam. It is also believed that lunatics and patients, having no cure even after prolonged medical treatment and a stay in the temple, can take a bath in muthirikinaru and be cured. =Daily worship= The Muthirikkinaru is addressed in Akilam as Muthal Thalam (the primary place in ritual importance). The Payyans start their daily routine only after the religious bathing in this well. After the ceremonial bath, they used to drink the sacred water (Patham) of the Muthirikkinaru for five times and give it so for the followers for five times. Then the Payyan circumambulate the Muthirikkinaru for five times and others follow him. Chanting \\"Ayya Siva-siva Siva-siva Ara-hara Ara-hara\\", all proceed to the Pathi. This is practiced thrice a day during the morning, noon, and evening Panividais. Also one of the important ritual actions performed by the devotees of Ayyavazhi is to take this ritual bath, drawing water from the well. This has become a ritual necessity to be gone through, before one worships at the Pathi. It is overwhelming to see the devotees throng the well to get a few buckets of water on to them and drink a few drops ceremoniously for five times and then proceed to the Pathi. This practice of bathing at the well is being addressed as Patham viduthal. =During festivals= Devotees circumnavigating Muthirikkinaru at the first day of Kodiyettru Thirunal Apart from this daily ritual, this Muthirikkinaru earns a religious significance during the eighth day of the Kodiyettru Thirunal festival. At that day, Lord Vaikundar is carried to muthirikinaru on a horse (vahana). It is believed that the God hunts kali. The ceremonial hunting of kali is done with a bow and arrow. Here, thousands of people assemble to drink the holy patham. Patham viduthal is the word used by the devotees for bathing in Muthirikinaru. There is a heavy rush to take a bath in the well on the first Sunday of the Tamil months. Arul Nool, the secondary holy book, advises to do Dharma near this well. During the Car festivals and during the Vaikunda Jayanthi celebrations, the worshippers are not allowed to draw water from Muthirikkinaru due to the limited size of the well and extent of the crowds that attend to worship. During those days, one or two Panividaiyalars are used to draw water from the well and to throw it onto the crowd. In this way the everyone in the crowd gets a few drops poured on their heads.

One of Stasi's most successful spies, code-named \\"Kid\\" or \\"Uwe\\", Carney became alienated and angry at the U.S. Air Force and U.S. policies under President Ronald Reagan. He began handing over U.S. military documents to the Stasi while working in West Berlin for the U.S. Air Force. After his transfer back to Goodfellow Air Force Base in 1984, Carney decided to once again request permanent asylum in East Germany. His whereabouts remained unknown until 1990 and he was carried on the rolls as a deserter. Carney was finally apprehended after the fall of the Berlin Wall by special agents of the United States Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) on April 22, 1991 at Pintschstra√üe 12 in the Friedrichshain district of Berlin. Biography Carney entered the U.S. Air Force in December 1980. From April 1982 to April 1984 he was assigned to the 6912th Electronic Security Group, Electronic Security Command at Tempelhof Central Airport in Berlin as a linguist and intelligence specialist, with duty station at the 6912th Marienfelde Field Site. Alienation In the ZDF film Informationen um jeden Preis, Carney admitted his homosexuality was the primary reason he became a spy. Carney quickly became disillusioned with the Air Force and its intelligence gathering operations, and there are several stories of him attempting to turn in his badge and quit in protest. His first-hand experiences during the NATO exercise Able Archer 83 strengthened his resolve to help avoid a nuclear conflict. Later, lonely, alienated, and under psychological stress, and he felt he had no one to talk to about his problems. He had intended to defect to East Germany on his first crossing, but he allowed himself to be drawn into espionage by East German intelligence agents who expertly manipulated him and claimed his complete loyalty. Spying While working at the Marienfelde Field Site in Berlin, Carney began copying classified documents which he then provided to the Stasi by repeatedly crossing back and forth into East Germany. In 1984 he was involuntarily transferred to Goodfellow Air Force Base in Texas to work as a technical instructor. Carney believed Goodfellow was a training base with no real-world intelligence of any interest to the Stasi. He soon discovered that he had been wrong. Carney continued providing the Stasi with documents, meeting his handlers in Mexico City and Rio de Janeiro in 1985. Feeling cut off from his supervisors in East Berlin and at increasing risk in what became known as \\"The Year of the Spy\\" he sought out the protection of the East German embassy in Mexico City. From there he was flown to Havana with the assistance of the Cuban government. Weeks later he returned to East Berlin via Prague. There he continued to work for Stasi (HVA Abt. XI and HA III) by intercepting and translating non-secure telephone communications of U.S. military commanders as well as the East German telephone lines dedicated to the U.S. embassy in East Berlin. Lifestyle and recognition During the course of his spying, Carney provided Stasi and other Eastern Bloc intelligence services with more than one hundred top-secret U.S. military documents. For his services to East Germany, he was awarded the NVA service medal in bronze and the medal of \\"Waffenbr√ºderschaft (Brotherhood in Arms)\\" in gold. His internal Stasi file shows the value of the work he performed for the Stasi and the KGB, earning praise from KGB General Chebrikov as well as from General Zaitsev of the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany (GSFG). Capture Pintschstra√üe 12, 10249 Berlin-Friedrichshain, taken 23 April 2014. A break in the case came after the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, when many Stasi records became available to foreign investigators and journalists. In April, 1991, Carney was located with the help of at least two former Stasi intelligence officers turned informants. In preparation for his apprehension, he was quickly assigned to the 7350th Air Base Group at his former base, Tempelhof Central Airport, several months before his apprehension. (Ironically, this assignment was official and had the unintended consequence of assigning Carney to a unit that supported Desert Shield/Desert Storm in 1991. As a result, Carney received the National Defense Service Medal while in solitary confinement at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, several years later.) On 22 April 1991, Carney was apprehended on a public street by AFOSI agents near his residence on Pintschstra√üe 12, in Friedrichshain, which used to be in the Soviet sector of Berlin. Immediately following his apprehension, he was taken to Tempelhof Airport, identified, and underwent nearly 28 hours of intense interrogation; after this, Carney refused to answer any more questions after his repeated requests for counsel had been denied. At this point the AFOSI, in consultation with other U.S. agencies, decided to quietly remove Carney from German territory. He was secretly flown to the United States aboard military aircraft the following day. Carney's arrest and return to the United States was coordinated at the highest levels of the United States government without consulting German officials. The U.S. Ambassador to the Federal Republic of Germany, Vernon Walters, personally acted as adviser to the Commander-in- Chief, United States Air Forces Europe, urging haste.Tageesspiegel article \\"Stasi-Spion Kid\\", 8 November 1999 Conviction Carney pleaded guilty to charges of espionage, conspiracy, and desertion and was sentenced in December 1991 to 38 years in prison. Carney served the mandatory portion of his sentence at both Quantico, Virginia and, later, the United States Disciplinary Barracks in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. Carney was released in 2002, after serving 11 years, seven months, and twenty days on a twenty-year sentence in accordance with his pretrial agreement. Later life After his release from prison, Carney attempted to return to Germany claiming to be a German citizen. However, as East Germany never naturalized him as a citizen and thus he had obtained his German passport fraudulently, German authorities refused to grant him a passport. He is reported to be living in Ohio. In November 2011 Carney submitted a lengthy manuscript detailing his life as a spy to the United States Air Force for security review. After numerous delays, the manuscript was finally cleared on July 26, 2012. The book, Against All Enemies: An American's Cold War Journey, was published in 2013.

Opuntian Locris or Eastern Locris was an ancient Greek region inhabited by the eastern division of the Locrians, the so-called tribe of the Locri Epicnemidii () or Locri Opuntii (Greek: ). Geography Opuntian Locris consisted of a narrow slip upon the eastern coast of central Greece, from the pass of Thermopylae to the mouth of the river Cephissus. The northern frontier town was Alpeni, which bordered upon the Malians, and the southern frontier town was Larymna, which at a later time belonged to Boeotia. The Locrians, however, did not inhabit this coast continuously, but were separated by a narrow slip of Phocis, which extended to the North Euboean Gulf, and contained the Phocian seaport town of Daphnus. The Locrians north of Daphnus were called Epicnemidii, from Mount Cnemis; and those south of this town were named Opuntii, from Opus, their principal city. On the west, the Locrians were separated from Phocis and Boeotia by a range of mountains, extending from Mount Oeta and running parallel to the coast. The northern part of this range, called Mount Cnemis,Strabo ix. pp. 416, 425. now Talanda, rises to a considerable height, and separated the Epicnemidii Locri from the Phocians of the upper valley of the Cephissus; the southern portion, which bore no specific name, is not so lofty as Mount Cnemis, and separated the Opuntian Locrians from the north-eastern parts of Boeotia. Lateral branches extended from these mountains to the coast, of which one terminated in the promontory Cnemides, opposite the islands called Lichades; but there were several fruitful valleys, and the fertility of the whole of the Locrian coast is praised both by ancient and modern observers.Strabo ix. p. 425; Forchhammer, Hellenika, pp. 11-12; George Grote, History of Greece, vol. ii. p. 381. In consequence of the proximity of the mountains to the coast there was no room for any considerable rivers. The largest, which, however, is only a mountain torrent, is the Boagrius (), called also Manes () by Strabo, rising in Mount Cnemis, and flowing into the sea between Scarpheia and Thronium.Homer Iliad ii. 533; Strabo ix. p. 426; Ptolemy iii. 15. ¬ß 11; Pliny iv. 7. s. 12; William Martin Leake, Northern Greece, vol. ii. p. 67. The only other river mentioned by name is the Platanius,, Pausanias ix. 24. ¬ß 5. a small stream, which flows into the Opuntian gulf near the Boeotian frontier: it is the river which flows from the modern village of Proskyn√°.Leake, vol. ii. p. 174. =Opuntian Gulf= The Opuntian Gulf,, Strab. ix. pp. 416, 425, 426. at the head of which stood the town of Opus, is a considerable bay, shallow at its inner extremity. In this bay, close to the coast, is the small island of Atalanta. History The Eastern Locrians, are mentioned by Homer, who describes them as following Ajax, the son of O√Øleus, to the Trojan War in forty ships, and as inhabiting the towns of Kynos, Opus, Calliarus, Besa, Scarphe, Augeiae, Tarphe, and Thronium.The Iliad ii. 527-535. Neither Homer, Herodotus, Thucydides, nor Polybius, make any distinction between the Opuntii and Epicnemidii; and, during the flourishing period of Greek history, Opus was regarded as the chief town of the Eastern Locrians. Even Strabo, from whom the distinction is chiefly derived, in one place describes Opus as the metropolis of the Epicnemidii (ix. p. 416); and the same is confirmed by Pliny (iv. 7. s. 12) and Stephanus.s. v. from Leake vol. ii. p. 181. In the Persian War the Opuntian Locrians fought with Leonidas at the Battle of Thermopylae, and also sent seven ships to the Greek fleet.Herodotus vii. 203, viii. 1. The Locrians fought on the side of Sparta in the Peloponnesian War.Thuc. ii. 9. The Locri Opuntii also minted coins in antiquity, some of which survive. Cities and towns The cities and towns of the Locri Epicnemidii, along the coast from north to south, were: Alpenus, Nicaea, Scarphe (Scarpheia), Thronium, Cnemis (Cnemides), more inland, Tarphe later Pharygae, and Augeiae. The cities and towns of the Locri Opuntii, along the coast from north to south, were: Alope, Kynos, Opus, Halae, Larymna which later belonged to Boeotia, more inland, Calliarus, Naryx, and Corseia.

It was added to the United States National Register of Historic Places in 1986. Relationship to surroundings This large brick structure is one of three industrial buildings that share a secluded, well-kept site in South Farms district. Separated from Main Street Extension by trees and undergrowth, the landscaped grounds are behind a row of East Main Street buildings. This, the largest structure, adjoins a brick building south; nearby to the east is a large barn-like structure. Since redeveloped during the 1980s, the address of the complex is 282 Main Street Extension. The previous entrance to East Main Street still exists as an exit. Significance This large brick building was constructed probably a short time after the Russell Manufacturing Company obtained the property in 1884. The site, formerly developed by the Sanseer Manufacturing Company, includes a brick building which had been that company's main shop, built in 1845. The Russell Manufacturing Company, established in 1834, produced a great variety of cotton and elastic woven goods. By 1894, it was the nation's largest manufacturer of suspenders, employing 900 workers in the company's seven groups of mills. This mill, powered by steam, probably housed weaving looms as did the other two buildings nearby. These structures formed the company's Sanseer Mill complex. In 1937, Philip Bliss purchased the property, which primarily used the property for office and storage space for the P&H; Bliss Company. The structure has two dominant vertical elements: a four-story stairwell extends from the middle of one side and a tall rectangular stack stands close by. The main entrance displays a small wooden portico. Its columns and plain entablature, painted white, contrast with the building's brick walls. This structure, one of the least altered early mills in the area, reflect the substantial development South Farms underwent following the American Civil War. During the late 19th century, the district experienced marked industrial and residential growth, primarily influenced by the success of the Russell Manufacturing Company. Current Use and Condition The Sanseer Mill was redeveloped into modern office space in the early 1980s. During the 1990s to 2003, the building was owned by Whitney Garlinghouse, owner of The Garlinghouse Company, an architectural house plan company, which housed its offices in the complex. The old buildings were maintained in original condition at great expense. The property was purchased by Dinar Chaudhury in 2006. As of 2011, the complex is partially occupied by numerous tenants, including John Conroy, DMD of Conroy Orthodontics, Anthony Onofrio, DMD and Pamela Moore, DMD of Middlesex Dental Associates, Roger Lane, DC of the Middletown Chiropractic Center, Jeffrey Palmer, OD and Dorothy Robison Collins, OD of the Palmer Eyecare Center, New England Residential Services, RaMa Luna Yoga Studio, and New England Geosystems, LLC (GIS consultants).

The reservation covers , and is located in north central Montana. The total area includes the main portion of their homeland, as well as off-reservation trust land. The tribes reported a total of 2,851 enrolled members in 2010. The capital and largest city is Fort Belknap Agency, at the reservation's north end. This is just south of the city of Harlem across the Milk River. In 2013, the tribes received part of a herd of bison and have re- introduced them to the local range. In June 2015, the US Department of Interior sent some 3500 offers to buy back fractionated land worth more than $54 million, affecting the future control of 26,000 tracts of land within the boundaries of the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation. This was under the Land Buy-Back Program for Tribal Nations, established as part of the federal government's 2009 settlement of the landmark Cobell v. Salazar suit over federal mismanagement of revenues due Indian landowners under the trust program.David Murray, \\"$54 million offered for tribal land on Fort Belknap Reservation\\", Great Falls Tribune, 10 June 2015; accessed 18 January 2017\\"DOI sends over $230M in offers to Indian landowners in Montana\\", Indianz.com, 8 June 2015; accessed 28 October 2016 History In October 1855, near the confluence of the Judith and Missouri rivers, the Blackfoot Confederacy signed an agreement to remain at peace with other Native American tribes and with citizens of the United States. The Nakoda Nation, along with the Lakota, Dakota, Mandan, Arikara, Hidatsa, Cheyenne, and Arapaho had signed the Treaty of Fort Laramie in 1851 with the United States government in what is now North Dakota. These treaties established the tribes' sacred territories within the continental United States. The Fort Belknap Reservation was established in 1888 in north central Montana. It comprises a small portion of the vast ancestral territory of the Blackfoot Confederacy, which consisted of the Northern and Southern Piegan (\\"Poor Robes\\"), Kainah (\\"Blood\\") and Siksika (\\"Black Feet\\") tribes and their historical allies, the Atsina or Aaniiih Nation (\\"Gros Ventre\\"). Their former territory extended across all of north- central and eastern Montana and portions of eastern North Dakota. Fort Belknap Reservation was named after William W. Belknap, the Secretary of War in President Ulysses S. Grant's administration. Belknap was later impeached for corruption. The origins of the name Aaniiih, (meaning the White Clay People) is unclear. Many believe that they painted themselves with white clay found along the Saskatchewan River for ceremony, like the northern Arapaho. Early French fur trappers and traders named this tribe \\"Gros Ventre.\\" Other tribes in the area referred to them as \\"The Water Falls People.\\" Lacking a common language, they used physical signs to indicate some terms. The sign for waterfall was the passing of the hands over the stomach. The French traders interpreted this as meaning \\"big belly,\\" and called the Aaniiih the \\"Gros Ventre,\\" meaning \\"big belly\\" in the French language. The Nakoda (meaning the Generous Ones) split with the Yanktonai Sioux in the seventeenth century. They migrated from the Minnesota woodlands westward onto the northern plains with their allies, the Plains Cree. The Chippewa called the Nakoda \\"Assiniboine\\" in their language, an Ojibwe word meaning \\"One who cooks with stones\\". The Nakoda would heat rocks and put them in rawhide pots to heat water and cook food. The Nakoda peoples live on both the Fort Belknap and Fort Peck Indian reservations in Montana and on several reserves in Saskatchewan and Alberta, Canada, where they are generally known as Stoney. The Aaniiih and Nakoda were nomadic hunters and warriors. They followed the bison, commonly called buffalo, for seasonal hunting; they made use of all parts of the massive animals, for food, clothing, cord, tools, etc. Their food, clothing, and teepees, were all derived from the buffalo. The buffalo was the Indian \\"staff of life,\\" supporting the nomadic cultures of the Nakoda, Aaniih, and other plains tribes. The last wild herd of buffalo in the continental United States in the nineteenth century roamed between the Bear Paw Mountains and the Little Rocky Mountains in the lush Milk River valley of Montana. Today, the two tribes are united as one federally recognized government called the Fort Belknap Indian Community. Together, the tribes have formed and maintained a community that has deep respect for its land, its culture, and its heritage. Fort Belknap derives its name from the original military and trading post established on the Milk River. The town of Harlem, Montana developed about northeast of the fort. Bison In March 2012, the Fort Belknap community received part of the herd of pure-bred Plains bison (Bison bison bison) from Yellowstone National Park that was transferred to the Fort Peck Indian Reservation. The tribes on these reservations introduced the Bison to their local ranges, a century after they were exterminated in the area.\\"Bison Return to Fort Belknap after a Century\\" , Indian Country Today, 23 August 2013 Communities *Fort Belknap Agency *Hays *Lodge Pole Land Buy-Back Program Generations after allotment was made of communal lands 94 years ago to individual tribal households under the Dawes Act, control has become split up among thousands of descendants of original allottees in many federally recognized tribes. The Fort Belknap Reservation has been described as one of the most fractionated in the country in terms of its landholdings, with an estimated 75% of land on the reservation being fractionated under individual owners. As part of the 2009 settlement of the Cobell v. Salazar class action suit, the Department of Interior has set up the Land Buy-Back Program for Tribal Nations to buy back such fractionated land from descendants, on a purely voluntary basis, with market value being offered. The land portions of those who accept the offers will be put in federal trust under control of the tribe, in order that it can increase the communal land base and improve its ability to manage resources for its members.

It was not officially named by the US National Hurricane Center as it was operationally classified as a non-tropical low. The storm developed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean out of a low-pressure area that gained subtropical characteristics on October 4\\\\. The storm was short-lived, crossing over the Azores later on October 4 before becoming extratropical again on October 5\\\\. No damages or fatalities were reported during that time. After being absorbed into a cold front, the system went on to become Hurricane Vince, which affected the Iberian Peninsula. Months after the hurricane season, when the National Hurricane Center was performing its annual review of the season and its named storms, forecasters Jack Beven and Eric Blake identified this previously unnoticed subtropical storm. Despite its unusual location and wide wind field, the system had a well-defined centre convecting around a warm core, the hallmark of a subtropical storm. Meteorological history The system originated out of an upper-level low just west of the Canary Islands on September 28\\\\. The low organized itself over the next days, producing several bursts of convection. While remaining non-tropical with a cold core it moved gradually west to northwest. On October 3, it became a broad surface low about 400 nautical miles (460 mi, 740 km) southwest of S√£o Miguel Island in the Azores. Early on October 4, convection increased as the surface low organized itself, and the system became a subtropical depression. Around the same time, the depression turned northeast into a warm sector ahead of an oncoming cold front, and strengthened into a subtropical storm. The system continued to track northeast and strengthened slightly, reaching its peak intensity of 50 mph (85 km/h) as it approached the Azores that evening. After tracking through the Azores, the storm weakened slightly as it moved to the north-northeast. Through an interaction with the cold front early on October 5 the subtropical storm became extratropical. The system was fully absorbed by the front later that day. The newly absorbed system would separate from the dissolving frontal system and become Subtropical Storm Vince on October 8. At the time, the system was not believed to have been subtropical. However, there were several post-season findings that confirmed that the system was indeed a subtropical storm. The first was the cloud pattern, in which it had deep convection around the center and was better organized with a well-defined center of circulation. In addition, the system had a warm core more typical of tropical cyclones as opposed to the cold core of extratropical cyclones. The warm-core nature also meant that there were no warm or cold fronts attached to the system, as temperatures did not change ahead of and behind the system until the unrelated cold front passed the Azores. Satellite imagery suggested that the system was briefly a tropical storm as the warm core was found; however, the widespread wind field and the presence of an upper-level trough confirmed that it was only subtropical. Impact, classification and records Tropical storm-force winds were reported across parts of the Azores, primarily on the eastern islands. The strongest winds were reported on Santa Maria Island, where 10-minute sustained winds reached 49 mph (79 km/h) with gusts to 59 mph (94 km/h). Ponta Delgada faced 38 mph (61 km/h) winds, with the peak recorded gust being 52 mph (85 km/h). No damage or fatalities were reported. The 2005 Azores storm was not classified as a subtropical storm until April 2006, after a reassessment by the National Hurricane Center. Every year, the NHC re-analyzes the systems of the past hurricane season and revises the storm history if there is new data that was operationally unavailable. This reanalysis revealed that the storm became a subtropical storm on October 4, making it the earliest forming 19th Atlantic tropical or subtropical storm on record. The previous record holder was an unnamed 1933 tropical storm that developed on October 26. The record is now held by Hurricane Teddy, which attained tropical storm strength on See also * List of Azores hurricanes References External links * NHC's on the storm Azores Subtropical Storm, 2005 Category:Hurricanes in the Azores Category:Subtropical storms Azores ST ","title":"2005 Azores subtropical storm"},{"id":"7715212","title":"Tremec TR-6060 transmission"},{"id":"7715219","text":"Casey Calvert can mean: * Casey Calvert (actress), American pornographic actress * Casey Calvert (Hawthorne Heights), musician in the band Hawthorne Heights ","title":"Casey Calvert"},{"id":"7715222","title":"Stockholm Cup International"},{"id":"7715229","text":"The Game Plan is a 2007 American family comedy film directed by Andy Fickman and written by Nichole Millard, Kathryn Price and Audrey Wells and starring Dwayne \\"The Rock\\" Johnson. It follows a professional quarterback who finds out he has an 8-year-old daughter from a previous relationship. It was the last film to be distributed by Buena Vista Pictures, after Disney retired the Buena Vista moniker across their company's divisions in the same year. It is also the final film where Johnson is credited with his ring name. The Game Plan was released in the United States on September 28, 2007. Plot In the last game of the American Football Federation regular season between the Boston Rebels and the New York Dukes, Rebels quarterback Joe Kingman (Dwayne Johnson) scores a touchdown after ignoring an open wide receiver, Travis Sanders. The next morning, an 8-year-old girl named Peyton Kelly (Madison Pettis) arrives on Joe's doorstep saying that she is his biological daughter, and that his divorced wife, Sara, sent her there to meet him. His agent, Stella Peck, thinks this will be bad for his image and distracts him with the upcoming playoffs. At the opening of his own restaurant, Joe inadvertently leaves without Peyton, and is on the cover of a tabloid the next day. Stella decides Joe needs a new fatherly image. At a later press conference, the reporters make Joe miserable, until Peyton comes to his defense, saying that he is new to this and trying the best he can, and that she thinks he is the best father in the world. Peyton then says that Joe has to repay her, so she has him take her to a ballet academy run by Monique Vasquez (Roselyn S√°nchez). Monique has Joe join their ballet performance to show him that ballet takes just as much athletic ability as football. Joe and Peyton begin their relationship after Peyton calls his arrogant and selfish behavior to his attention. Joe takes Peyton and her new friends to the mall where he begins to develop romantic feelings for Monique. The Rebels march through the playoffs via three road games: Denver in the Wild Card round, Indianapolis in the Divisional round and finally Baltimore in the Conference round. They eventually make it to the championship game held in Arizona in a rematch with the New York Dukes. Stella offers Joe a $25 million endorsement deal with Fanny's Burgers, a successful fast food restaurant run by Samuel Blake, Jr., if he wins the game and mentions the product to the press. While at lunch with Joe and Monique, Peyton accidentally reveals that her mother does not know that she is with him. She was supposed to go to a ballet school program for the month, but instead she ran away to be with Joe. Peyton then has an allergic reaction to the nuts in the dessert she was eating, and Joe rushes her to the hospital; however, the doctors tell him that the reaction is mild, and his daughter is going to be fine. Joe's former sister-in-law and Peyton's legal guardian, Karen Kelly, arrives to take her home. Joe discovers that Sara was killed in a traffic collision six months earlier, and that Peyton sneaked away on her own. After Peyton overhears Stella explaining that she would be a distraction to Joe, Karen and Peyton return home. Later, while going through Peyton's bag under her bed, Joe finds some photos and reads a letter from Sara, saying that she hid Peyton away from Joe, as his career was just starting and she didn‚Äôt want Peyton to be a distraction to him. As the championship game begins, Joe's mind is not fully set on the game and he is soon injured. Joe is surprised to discover that Peyton has arrived with Karen. Understanding Joe's earlier words about how he wants to remain in Peyton's life, Karen decides to let Peyton live with Joe. Near the end of the fourth quarter, Joe passes the ball to the running back, Jamal Webber, who gains positive yardage but fails to get out of bounds. Joe hurries his team to the line with the clock running, and rushes ahead before being knocked out of bounds. With time for one last play, Joe throws a lob pass to Sanders, who catches the pass, allowing the Rebels to win their first championship. In a post-game interview, Joe declines the Fanny's Burgers offer to be with Peyton.

Production The Game Plan was filmed in the Boston, Massachusetts area. The movie was also filmed in three stadiums across the country: Gillette Stadium in Foxboro, Invesco Field at Mile High in Denver, and Sun Devil Stadium in Arizona. Johnson's character taking ballet lessons in the movie was an indirect nod to Pro Football Hall of Fame wide receiver Lynn Swann, who took ballet lessons during his NFL career with the Pittsburgh Steelers. Swann later worked as a reporter for Disney- owned ABC and ESPN. Swann left Disney for a career in politics while The Game Plan was in pre-production.

The plot concerns a big game hunter on an island who hunts humans for sport. The film stars Joel McCrea, Leslie Banks, and King Kong leads Fay Wray and Robert Armstrong; it was made by a team including Ernest B. Schoedsack and Merian C. Cooper, the co-directors of King Kong (1933). The film was shot at night on the King Kong jungle sets. Plot In 1932, a luxury yacht is sailing through a channel off the western coast of South America. Among the passengers is big game hunter and author Bob Rainsford. In discussing the sport with other passengers, Bob is asked if he would exchange places with the animals he hunts. After the yacht's owner disregards the captain's concerns about the channel lights not matching the charts, the ship runs aground, takes on water and explodes. Ultimately, Bob is the lone survivor, swimming to a small island. He sees the channel lights off the shoreline change, and suspects the ship was deliberately led off course to its doom. Bob stumbles across a chateau where he becomes the guest of the expatriate Russian Count Zaroff, a fellow hunting enthusiast, who is familiar with Bob and his writings. Zaroff says four other shipwrecked survivors are also guests: Eve Trowbridge, her brother Martin, and two sailors. Later, Zaroff introduces Bob to the Trowbridges, and tells them his obsession with hunting became boring until he discovered \\"the most dangerous game\\" on the island. Bob doesn't understand Zaroff, who fails to explain further. Eve is suspicious of Zaroff and tells Bob the two sailors that survived with them have not been seen since each visited Zaroff's trophy room. During the night, when Martin also vanishes, Eve and Bob go to the trophy room where they find the \\"trophies\\" are men's heads. Zaroff appears with Martin's body. Now realizing what prey Zaroff hunts, Bob calls him a madman and is restrained. Bob refuses Zaroff's offer to join him in hunting humans, and Zaroff tells Bob he must be the next prey. Like those before him, Bob will be turned loose at dawn, given a hunting knife and some provisions and allowed the entire day to roam the island until midnight, when Zaroff will begin his hunt. If Bob survives until 4 a.m., then Bob \\"wins\\" the game and Zaroff will give him keys to his boathouse so he can leave the island. Zaroff then says he has never lost what he terms \\"outdoor chess.\\" Eve decides to go with Bob, and Zaroff tells Eve he will not hunt her since she is a female; but, if Bob loses, she must return with him. The pair spend most of the day setting a trap for Zaroff. But, when the hunt begins, Zaroff finds the trap and begins a cat and mouse pursuit of Bob. Eventually, Bob and Eve are trapped by a waterfall. When Bob is attacked by a hunting dog, Zaroff shoots and both Bob and the dog fall into the water. Presuming Bob dead, Zaroff takes Eve back to his fortress to enjoy his prize. However, Bob returns to the chalet to Zaroff's surprise. It seems the dog, not Bob, was shot. Zaroff admits defeat and presents the key to the boathouse, but Bob discovers him holding a gun behind his back. Bob first fights Zaroff, then his henchmen, killing the henchmen and mortally wounding Zaroff. As Bob and Eve speed away in a motor boat, the dying Zaroff tries to shoot them with his bow. Unsuccessful, he succumbs to his wounds, and falls out of a window into the pack of his frenzied hunting dogs, which it is implied \\"prey\\" upon him.

Home media and colorization Fay Wray and Joel McCrea in The Most Dangerous Game (1932) The Most Dangerous Game lapsed into the public domain in 1960 and has since seen a plethora of budget releases. The first high-quality edition was via a 1995 LaserDisc from the ROAN Group. In 1999, Criterion released a restored DVD featuring an audio commentary by film historian Bruce Eder. The film was initially colorized in 1992 and again, using improved technology, in 2008 by Legend Films, who subsequently released their version on DVD alongside the B&W; version. In 2012, Flicker Alley released the film on a region-free Blu-ray; this version was restored from the original 35mm studio fine grain master by film preservationist David Shepard. The Blu-ray also included Gow the Headhunter (1931) a.k.a. Cannibal Island, an audio commentary for each film and an audio interview with Merian C. Cooper, conducted by film historian Kevin Brownlow.

For development, it provides Dynamic C, a non-standard dialect of C with proprietary structures for multitasking. Rabbit Semiconductor was purchased in 2006 by Digi International.Digi International Acquires Rabbit Semiconductor Before the purchase, Rabbit Semiconductor was a division of Z-World, Inc. Z-World developed and manufactured embedded controller products as well as embedded software development environments. Microcontroller architecture The Rabbit processor family shares many features with the Zilog Z80/Z180 processors. For example, the registers of a Rabbit 2000/3000 processor are almost the same as the registers of a Z80/Z180 processor. The Rabbit 4000 processor expands to include the use of 32-bit registers. The instruction set of Rabbit processors also closely resembles the instruction set of the Z80/Z180 family. While the opcodes of many instructions are the same between the Rabbit 2000/3000 processors and Z80/Z180 processors, the two families of processors are not binary compatible. As with the Z80/Z180 family, the Rabbit processors are CISC processors. The Rabbit processor family has unique features. For example, the Z80/Z180 family disables interrupts once an interrupt is serviced by an interrupt service routine. However, the Rabbit processors permit interrupts to interrupt service routines according to priorities (a total of 4). Rabbit Semiconductor claims that the instruction set of Rabbit processors is optimized for C code.Rabbit 3000 Microprocessor User's Manual. Dynamic C Perhaps the most notable feature of the Rabbit microcontroller is its development environment. Dynamic C, a product of Rabbit Semiconductor, has additions, deletions and inconsistencies compared to the ANSI-C standard. ;Note: (Reference: Porting a Program to Dynamic C-Rabbit Semiconductor) > Dynamic C follows the ISO/ANSI C standard when feasible and desirable. > Because the standard does not take into account the special needs of > embedded systems, it is necessary to depart from the standard in some areas > and desirable in others. The standard does not take into account important > embedded systems issues such as read only memory and embedded assembly > language. For this reason, practical compilers intended for embedded systems > do not completely comply with the standard, but use it as a guide. As an example of an addition, Dynamic C has a chaining mechanism to chain fragments of code from different subroutines to an arbitrary number of chains. This extension permits the use of not only initialized variables, but any arbitrary code to execute before a program starts execution in the main function. As an example of a deletion, as of version 10.23 Dynamic C does not support block scope variables or bit fields. The development toolchain does not include a separate preprocessor and linker, which may complicate the process of porting existing programs to the compiler. As of version 10.64 block scope for variables is supported. As an example of an inconsistency, Dynamic C implicitly treats all initialized global variables as if they were declared with the \`const\` qualifier. Furthermore, all \`const\` variables reside in flash memory. Earlier versions of Dynamic C did not check the use of the \`const\` keyword in parameters‚Äîit was possible to pass a \`const\` variable as a parameter to a function that did not expect it, potentially leading to attempts to write to flash memory. As of the latest version of Dynamic C, the compiler will produce an error when the user attempts to modify a \`const\` variable directly, and will produce a warning if the user discards the \`const\` qualifier when passing a parameter to a function. =Multitasking constructs= One noteworthy feature of Dynamic C is its inclusion of language constructs to simplify multitasking. These constructs, the \`costate\` statement and the \`slice\` statement, implement a form of cooperative and preemptive multitasking, respectively. As an example, consider the following program which flashes two LEDs with different frequencies: void main() { while (1) { // Create 2 costatements which will toggle our LEDs. costate { led1on(); waitfor(DelayMs(100)); led1off(); waitfor(DelayMs(50)); } costate { led2on(); waitfor(DelayMs(200)); led2off(); waitfor(DelayMs(50)); } } } When this code is run, the first costatement will be executed, and the first LED will turn on. The costatement will then yield to the second statement while it waits for 100 milliseconds. The second costatement will execute in a similar manner. While both costatements are waiting for their time to elapse, the while loop will busy-wait, but this waiting time could potentially be used to perform other tasks.

John Henry Bagot Lane, he was educated at Malvern College.Walter Bromley-Davenport profile, cricketarchive.com; retrieved 30 April 2012. Soldiering  He joined the Grenadier Guards in 1922. In 1926 he was British Army welterweight boxing champion, a fact usually mentioned on his election literature during his subsequent political career. At the outbreak of World War II he raised and commanded the 5th Battalion of the Cheshire Regiment. Political career He was Conservative Member of Parliament for Knutsford from 1945 until 1970, and was a Conservative junior Whip from 1948‚Äì51. He lost his junior Whip position after kicking the Belgium ambassador down a flight of steps. He mistook the ambassador for a colleague who he thought had left the Commons before the 10 o'clock vote.Brewer's Rogues, Villains & Eccentrics, An A-Z of Roguish Britons Through the Ages, William Donaldson, 2002; He was a member of the British Boxing Board of Control from 1953. He was appointed Deputy Lieutenant of Cheshire in 1949 and knighted in 1961. Bromley-Davenport would have made an excellent Whip if he hadn't been dismissed, as he was known to have an extraordinarily loud voice. He would startle new Labour MPs when they rose to make a speech by screaming 'Take your Hands out of your pockets!' On one occasion he shouted 'Sit down!' at Otho Prior-Palmer, MP for Worthing, which the minister immediately did, as he attempted to speak at the same time as Davenport.Brewer's Rogues, Villains & Eccentrics, An A-Z of Roguish Britons Through the Ages, William Donaldson, 2002, Davenport was known to use his voice outside of Parliament. When he entered an overcrowded train in Crewe, he walked up and down the corridor shouting 'All change!'. When everyone left he took a seat. He was also attacked by a man with an axe in his home. Davenport screamed 'Don't let the NHS get me!' and the assailant fled.Brewer's Rogues, Villains & Eccentrics, An A-Z of Roguish Britons Through the Ages, William Donaldson, 2002; Family His son, William Arthur Bromley-Davenport, served as High Sheriff of Cheshire and Lord Lieutenant of Cheshire.

Their main feature is that these reactions, unlike most reactions, have steric factors greater than unity, that is, they take place faster than predicted by collision theory. This is explained by the fact that the colliding particles have greater cross sections than the pure geometrical ones calculated from their radii, because when the particles are close enough, an electron \\"jumps\\" (therefore the name) from one of the particles to the other one, forming an anion and a cation which subsequently attract each other. Harpoon reactions usually take place in the gas phase, but they are also possible in condensed media. The predicted rate constant can be improved by using a better estimation of the steric factor. A rough approximation is that the largest separation Rx at which charge transfer can take place on energetic grounds, can be estimated from the solution of the following equation that determines the largest distance at which the Coulombic attraction between the two oppositely charged ions is sufficient to provide the energy ŒîE0 :\\\\frac{-e^2}{R_x}+\\\\Delta E_0 = 0 With \\\\Delta E_0 = IP - EA, where IP is the ionization potential of the metal and EA is the electron affinity of the halogen.

Life Fan Chou was from Jincheng Commandery (ÈáëÂüéÈÉ°), Liang Province, which is around present-day Yuzhong County, Gansu. He started his career as a subordinate of the warlord Dong Zhuo, who controlled the Han central government and the figurehead Emperor Xian between 189 and 192. After Dong Zhuo was assassinated in Chang'an in 192, Fan Chou joined a group of Dong Zhuo's followers, led by Li Jue and Guo Si, and seized back control of Chang'an from Wang Yun and L√º Bu. Li Jue and Guo Si then controlled the Han central government and Emperor Xian in the same way Dong Zhuo did. Around this time, they promoted Fan Chou to the rank of a General of the Household (‰∏≠ÈÉéÂ∞á). In 194, when a rival warlord Ma Teng led his forces to attack Li Jue and Guo Si, Fan Chou led troops to resist the enemy and defeated them at Changping Pass (Èï∑Âπ≥Èóú). In the same year, he also defeated Qiang rebels in Zuopingyi (Â∑¶È¶ÆÁøä; around present-day Dali County, Shaanxi) and was further promoted to General of the Right (Âè≥Â∞áËªç). He became one of the most powerful figures in the Han central government alongside Li Jue and Guo Si at the time. During the battle against Ma Teng, Fan Chou had scolded Li Jue's nephew, Li Li (ÊùéÂà©), who accompanied him into battle, for not doing his best. Li Li bore a grudge against Fan Chou for this. Later, he secretly reported to his uncle that Fan Chou was plotting with another rival warlord, Han Sui, against him. Li Jue thus became suspicious of Fan Chou, especially as Fan Chou gained higher status and more power. In 195, Li Jue and Guo Si lured Fan Chou into a trap and assassinated him.

Dong Zhuo deeply trusted him and arranged for him to marry his daughter; Niu Fu was thus a son-in-law of Dong Zhuo. In 189, after Dong Zhuo occupied the imperial capital Luoyang and seized control of the Han central government, he appointed Niu Fu as a General of the Household (‰∏≠ÈÉéÂ∞á).

History Tacoma was the site of an early sawmill in 1853. The deepwater port began to boom in the 1870s, sailing ships and steam tugs called in. The Northern Pacific Railroad arrived, by way of the Columbia River in 1874,and the port began to boom (the line via Montana was finished in 1883, but access from California and Nevada did not come till 1891). Tea, wheat, lumber, coal, and apples were moved. Trade with Asia exploded. A through railway line was built across the Cascade mountains at Stampede Pass in 1890s and Tacoma began its longtime rivalry with its upstart neighbor 25 miles to the north. Thea Foss, the waterway's namesake, founded the Foss Maritime Company on the inlet in 1889.History of Foss Maritime She expanded with rowboats, naptha launches and steam tugs. Foss Tug became the pre-eminent towing company in Puget Sound. Today Foss is the largest tug concern on the Pacific Coast. Initially, the railroads owned the foreshore, as they continue to do till this day. But the City Fathers of Tacoma saw the need to wrest control of the land and build the port. In 1919, the Port of Tacoma was established to capture Panama Canal Traffic, and the sprawling port was expanded into the river delta. Another major railroad arrived--the Milwaukee Road, and it brought further trade. Sawmills, cedar shingle mills, boat yards, wharves, granaries and warehouses proliferated in the area. Railroad yards extended on the flat foreshore. Fishworks, and processing plants were set up on the shore. Cleanup and redevelopment 101 years ago, the Thea Foss Waterway was a thriving industrial center. Industry began to dwindle in the area, and by 1981, the Thea Foss Waterway was almost entirely abandoned. In 1983, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) listed the Thea Foss and Wheeler-Osgood waterways as part of the larger Commencement Bay Superfund site. The final cap from the Superfund cleanup action on the Thea Foss Waterway occurred back in February 2006.Commencement Bay, Nearshore/Tideflats, Environmental Protection Agency. As of 2010, planned development is underway along the waterway. When complete, the new development will feature parks, residential areas, and office space. A public esplanade will run along the length of the waterway. 7 of the 15 development sites are either constructed or have specific plans for redevelopment. The project is overseen by the Foss Waterway Development Authority Board (FWDA). Local leaders see the Thea Foss Waterway as an economic opportunity, and seek to restore it to the commercial hub that it once was.

History and development In 1938, development began for a new light tank for the Japanese Army. While the Type 95 Ha-Go had performed well against the National Revolutionary Army of the China in the Second Sino-Japanese War and successfully engaged United States M3 Stuart light tanks on the Bataan Peninsula in December 1941, it was quickly growing obsolete. Although its 37mm gun was adequate for most light armor designed and built in the 1930s, the Ha-Go, like the tanks of the US Army prior to 1941, was not designed to fight enemy tanks, but rather to support the infantry. The Type 95's light armor made it vulnerable to .50 caliber machine gun fire and attempts to address these shortcomings via the Type 98 Ke-Ni and Type 2 Ke-To were steps in the right direction, but were still insufficient. Therefore, a complete design review was held and a prototype for a new standard light tank was completed by 1942. At this point the project was shelved, as the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff had to concede to the Imperial Navy's needs of raw materials necessary for the production of warships and warplanes. Mass production was finally authorized in 1945, by which time it was too late. Production was impossible due to shortages of materials such as steel, and the bombing of Japan. Only a single prototype was completed by the Hino Jido Sha company by the end of World War II. Design =Armor= The Type 5 Ke-Ho had armor of up to 20 mm, and a Type 1 47 mm main gun, an improvement over existing Japanese light tanks. The tank weighed 10 tons due to increased armor thickness and a bigger engine. The two-man turret layout drew on previous design experience from the Type 1 Chi-He. =Mobility= The tank was powered by a Type 100 air cooled diesel engine yielding 150 HP, for a top speed of 50 km/h. Details about the engine design still remains unknown. One theory indicates it was an improved version of the Chiyoda EC engine manufactured by Tokyo Gas and Electronics Industry in 1937. The tank also had a fuel tank capacity of 130 L.‰πù‰∫îÂºèËªΩÊà¶Ëªä „ÉèÂè∑ Notes References   External links *World War II Tanks *World War II Drawings Type 5 Ke-Ho 5 Ke-Ho Category:Light tanks of Japan ","title":"Type 5 Ke-Ho light tank"},{"id":"7715524","text":"The Balkan frog (Pelophylax kurtmuelleri) also known as the Balkan water frog and Greek marsh frog) is a species of frog occurring in Greece and, to a lesser extent, in Albania, Montenegro, and Serbia. The species highly resembles Pelophylax ridibundus, from which it was only distinguished in 1991 by bio-acoustic analysis. The separation of the species is not unanimously accepted. The average length is 72 mm for males, 78 mm for females. The back is green or occasionally brown, often with a light green stripe down the middle, and with darker spots irregularly distributed across the back. The tympanum is bronze or green surrounded by a darker color. The species is found across Greece except in the northeastern corner, where P. ridibundus is found instead. In Western Greece it lives along with Pelophylax epeiroticus. It occurs from sea level up to 1000 m, though large populations are not found above 600 m. Small introduced populations live in Denmark, Poland and Italy.

A chain may consist of two or more links. Chains can be classified by their design, which can be dictated by their use: * Those designed for lifting, such as when used with a hoist; for pulling; or for securing, such as with a bicycle lock, have links that are torus shaped, which make the chain flexible in two dimensions (the fixed third dimension being a chain's length). Small chains serving as jewellery are a mostly decorative analogue of such types. * Those designed for transferring power in machines have links designed to mesh with the teeth of the sprockets of the machine, and are flexible in only one dimension. They are known as roller chains, though there are also non-roller chains such as block chain. Two distinct chains can be connected using a quick link, carabiner, or clevis. Uses for chain Links of the American Revolutionary War-era Hudson River Chain as a memorial at West Point Uses for chain include: =Decoration= * Jewelry chain, many necklaces and bracelets are made out of small chains of gold and silver * Chain of office, collar or heavy gold chain worn as insignia of office or a mark of fealty in medieval Europe and the United Kingdom * Decorating clothing, some people wear wallets with chains connected to their belts, or pants decorated with chains * Omega chain, a pseudo-chain where the 'links' are mounted on a backing rather than being interlinked =Power transfer= * Bicycle chain, transfers power from the pedals to the drive- wheel of a bicycle, thus propelling it * Chain drive, the main feature that differentiated the safety bicycle * Chain gun, type of machine gun that is driven by an external power source, sometimes connected by a chain, to actuate the mechanism rather than using recoil * Chain pumps, type of water pump where an endless chain has positioned on it circular discs * Chainsaw, portable mechanical, motorized saw using a cutting chain to saw wood * Flat chain, form of chain used chiefly in agricultural machinery * Ladder chain, a light wire chain used with sprockets for low torque power transmission * O-ring chain, a specialized type of roller chain * Roller chain, the type of chain most commonly used for transmission of mechanical power on bicycles, motorcycles, and in industrial and agricultural machinery * Timing chain, used to transfer rotational position from the crankshaft to the valve and ignition system on an internal combustion engine, typically with a 2:1 speed reduction. =Security and restraint= * Ball and chain, phrase that can refer to either the actual restraint device that was used to slow down prisoners, or a derogatory description of a person's significant other * Belly chain (or \\"waist chain\\"), a physical restraint worn by prisoners, consisting of a chain around the prisoner's waist, to which the prisoner's hands are chained or cuffed Prisoner in belly chain * Bicycle lock (or \\"Bicycle Chain\\"), lockable chain * Chain boom, large chains used to exclude warships from harbors and rivers * Chain link fencing, fencing that utilizes vertical wires that are bent in a zig zag fashion and linked to each other * Chain mail, a type of armor consisting of small metal rings linked together in a pattern to form a mesh. * Door chain, a type of security chain on a door that makes it possible to open a door from the inside while still making it difficult for someone outside to force their way inside * Gang transport chain, a chain used to shackle two or more inmates together for transport or work outside the facility, forming a chain gang * Leg iron chains (fetters), an alternative to handcuffs * Prisoner transport restraints, a combination which consists of a pair of handcuffs attached by a longer chain to a pair of leg irons * Security chain, chain with square edges to prevent cutting with bolt-cutters * Chain gun * on chain-linked handcuffs the cuffs are held together by a short chain =Traction and pulling= * Anchor cable, as used by ships and boats, in British nautical usage it is a cable, not a chain * Chain steam shipping * Chain-linked Lewis, lifting device made from two curved steel legs * Curb chain, used on curb bits when riding a horse * High-tensile chain (or \\"Transport chain\\"), chain with a high tensile strength used for towing or securing loads * Jack chain, a toothed chain used to move logs * Lead shank (or \\"Stud chain\\"), used on horses that are misbehaving * Pull switch, an electrical switch operated by a chain * Rigid chain actuator, a type of chain that only bends in one direction, allowing it to operate under compression * Snow chains, used to improve traction in snow * Lavatory chain, the chain attached to the cistern of an old-fashioned W.C. in which the flushing power is obtained by a gravity feed from above-head height. Although most cisterns no longer work like that, the phrase \\"pull the chain\\" is still encountered to mean \\"flush the toilet\\". =Weapons= * Chain gun, type of machine gun that is driven by an external power source, sometimes connected by a chain, to actuate the mechanism rather than using recoil * Chain-shot, a type of ammunition for a cannon, used to inflict damage to the rigging of a sail vessel in naval warfare * Chain weapon, a medieval weapon made of one or more weights attached to a handle with a chain =Other uses= * Chains can be used as a percussion instrument for special effects, such as in Sch√∂nberg's Gurre-Lieder and Jan√°ƒçek's From the House of the Dead. * Chains are a common component of the deflection assembly of disc golf baskets. * Keychain, a small chain that connects a small item to a keyring * Chain sinnet, a method of shortening a rope or other cable while in use or for storage * Chain stitch, a sewing and embroidery technique Invention The metal link chain has been in use since at least 225 BC.As early as 225 BC, chain was used to draw a bucket of water up from a well. This very early bucket chain was composed of connected metal rings. Symbolism The prevalent modern symbolism is oppression, due to the use for a mechanical restriction of the liberty of a human or animal. Chains can also symbolize interconnectivity or interdependence. Unicode, in versions 6.x, contains the , which may show chain link(s). It may also denote a hyperlink.

It was built of Clapboard siding, Brownstone foundation with asphalt shingle roof using a structural system of wood frame, post and beam with gable roof. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 10, 1970. Relationship to Surroundings This center-hall Colonial house faces east from the northwest corner of Washington Street Extension and Camp Street. From this site on the east slope of a ridge it commands a long view east. Although Washington Street Extension passes close by on the southwest, the house is obscured from view by thickly planted trees. Significance Judge Seth Wetmore (1700‚Äì1788) built this house in 1746. Judge Wetmore served as deputy to the General Assembly for forty-eight terms, and was Judge of the County Court at Hartford. No doubt one of the great local mansions of its day, it remains Middletown's best example of high style Georgian architecture. the interior is of exceptional sophistication in its appointments; the northeast parlor alone is justly famous for the high quality of its decoration. It displays in original condition a corner shell cupboard with sun-burst decoration; marbleized fluted pilasters at either side of the fireplace opening, and fine overmantel painting. The woodwork in this room is in its original condition and excellently preserved. Although the builder of this house is unknown, it is evident that he was a master joiner. A house recorded in a Colonial Dames monograph (William Cooper House, destroyed 1930d) bears such marked similarities to this house that it is likely they were built by the same man. This house remained in the Wetmore family for over two hundred years, and there are many traditions concerning the house including visits by Jonathan Edwards, Timothy Dwight IV, Aaron Burr and General Lafayette. A large hemlock on the property is said to have been planted by Judge Wetmore's daughter Lucy. The Judge Seth Wetmore House is significant for its long association with the Wetmore family and as Middletown's finest example of Georgian Colonial architecture.

Now withdrawn and retired from prison use, it operated from 1876 to 1995. Currently, the site is maintained as a tourist attraction and training facility. Design The Penitentiary's design is similar to the facility at the 1858 state prison in Joliet, Illinois, with its castellated Gothic, stone structure, complete with turrets and battlements, except it is scaled down to half the size. The original architectural designs have been lost. The dimensions of the parallelogram-shaped prison yard are 82¬Ω feet in length, by 352¬Ω feet in width. The stone walls are thick at the base, tapering to 2¬Ω feet at the top, with foundations deep. The center tower section is long. It lies at the western side of the complex along Jefferson Avenue and is considered the front, as this is where the main entrance is located. The walls here are high and wide at the base, tapering to towards the top. History =Founding= In 1863, West Virginia seceded from Virginia at the height of the American Civil War. Consequently, the new state had a shortage of various public institutions, including prisons. From 1863 to 1866, Governor Arthur I. Boreman lobbied the West Virginia Legislature for a state penitentiary but was repeatedly denied. The Legislature at first directed him to send the prisoners to other institutions out of the state, and then they directed him to use existing county jails, which turned out to be inadequate. After nine inmates escaped in 1865, the local press took up the cause, and the Legislature took action. On February 7, 1866, the state legislature approved the purchase of land in Moundsville for the purpose of constructing a state prison. Ten acres were purchased just outside the then city limits of Moundsville for $3000. Moundsville proved an attractive site, as it is approximately twelve miles south of Wheeling, West Virginia, which at that time was the state capital. The state built a temporary wooden prison nearby that summer. This gave prison officials time to assess what prison design should be used. They had chosen a modified version of the design of Northern Illinois Penitentiary at Joliet. Its Gothic Revival architecture \\"exhibit[ed], as much as possible, great strength and convey[ed] to the mind a cheerless blank indicative of the misery which awaits the unhappy being who enters within its walls.\\" The first building constructed on the site was the North Wagon Gate. It was made with hand-cut sandstone, which was quarried from a local site. The state used prison labor during the construction process, and work continued on this first phase until 1876. When completed, the total cost was of $363,061. In addition to the North Wagon Gate, there was now north and south cellblock areas (both measuring 300 ft. by 52 ft.). South Hall had 224 cells (7 ft. by 4 ft.), and North Hall had a kitchen, dining area, hospital, and chapel. A 4-story tower connecting the two was the administration building (measuring 75 ft. by 75 ft.). It included space for female inmates and personal living quarters for the warden and his family. The facility officially opened in this year, and it had a prison population of 251 male inmates, including some who had helped construct the prison where they were incarcerated. After this phase, work began on prison workshops and other secondary facilities. =Operation= In addition to construction, the inmates had other jobs to do in support of the prison. In the early 1900s some industries within the prison walls included a carpentry shop, a paint shop, a wagon shop, a stone yard, a brickyard, a blacksmith, a tailor, a bakery, and a hospital. At the same time, revenue from the prison farm and inmate labor helped the prison financially. It was virtually self-sufficient. A prison coal mine located a mile away opened in 1921. This mine helped fill some of the prison's energy needs and saved the state an estimated $14,000 a year. Some inmates were allowed to stay at the mine's camp under the supervision of a mine foreman, who was not a prison employee. Conditions at the prison during the turn of the 20th century were good, according to a warden's report, which stated that, \\"both the quantity and the quality of all the purchases of material, food and clothing have been very gradually, but steadily, improved, while the discipline has become more nearly perfect and the exaction of labor less stringent.\\" Education was a priority for the inmates during this time. They regularly attended class. Construction of a school and library was completed in 1900 to help reform and educate inmates. Cells where the prison's worst inmates were kept. However, the conditions at the prison worsened through the years, and the facility would be ranked on the United States Department of Justice's Top Ten Most Violent Correctional Facilities list. One of the more infamous locations in the prison, with instances of gambling, fighting, and raping, was a recreation room known as \\"The Sugar Shack\\". A notable inmate in the early 20th century was labor activist Eugene V. Debs, who served time here from April 13 to June 14, 1919 (at which time he was transferred to an Atlanta prison) on charges of violating the Espionage Act of 1917. In 1929, the state decided to double the size of the penitentiary because overcrowding was a problem. The 5 x cells were too small to hold three prisoners at a time, but until the expansion, there was no other option. Two prisoners would sleep in the bunks, with the third sleeping on a mattress on the floor. The state used prison labor again and completed this phase of construction in 1959. The construction had been delayed by a steel shortage during World War II. In total, thirty-six homicides took place in the prison. One of the more notable ones is the butchering of R.D. Wall, inmate number 44670. On October 8, 1929, after \\"snitching\\" on his fellow inmates, he was attacked while heading to the boiler room by three prisoners with dull shivs. In 1983, convicted multiple murderer Charles Manson requested to be transferred to this prison to be nearer to his family. His request was denied. = 1979 prison break = On Wednesday, November 7, 1979, fifteen prisoners escaped from the prison. One of the escapees was Ronald Turney Williams, serving time for murdering Sergeant David Lilly of the Beckley Police Department on May 12, 1975. He managed to steal a prison guard's service weapon in the escape, and upon reaching the streets of Moundsville, encountered twenty-three-year-old off-duty West Virginia State Trooper Philip S. Kesner, who was driving past the prison with his wife. Trooper Kesner saw the escapees and attempted to take action against them. The prisoners pulled him from his car and Williams shot him. Trooper Kesner returned fire at the fleeing suspects despite being mortally wounded. Williams remained at large for eighteen months, sending taunting notes to authorities and making the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List. During that time, he murdered John Bunchek in Scottsdale, Arizona during a robbery and was connected to crimes in Colorado and Pennsylvania. After a shootout with federal agents at the George Washington Hotel in New York City in 1981, he was apprehended and returned to West Virginia to complete several life sentences. Arizona had sought his extradition for his execution, but as of he remains in West Virginia custody. At the time, Marshall County Sheriff Robert Lightner was very critical about poor police communications during the break. The sheriff's office and local police did not learn about the escape from the state police. They first heard of it over the police scanner. \\"It was a good twenty minutes before we knew about the escape. If somebody had notified us, there's a good chance that the sheriff's department and the Moundsville police could have been on the scene while all the prisoners were still on the block.\\" He was also critical of the four-state manhunt that followed, when convicted murderers David Morgan and Ronald T. Williams, along with convicted rapist Harold Gowers, Jr., remained at large. \\"Communications have been very poor. I think they should keep the local law enforcement officers more informed I have no idea what they're doing, what they've found.\\" = 1986 riot = January 1, 1986 was the date of one of the most infamous riots in recent history. The West Virginia Penitentiary was undergoing many changes and problems. Security had become extremely loose in all areas. Since it was a \\"cons\\" prison, most of the locks on the cells had been picked and inmates roamed the halls freely. Bad plumbing and insects caused rapid spreading of various diseases. The prison was holding more than 2,000 men and crowding was an issue. Another major contribution to the riot's cause was the fact that it was a holiday. Many of the officers had called off work, and prisoners planned to conduct their uprising on this specific day. At around 5:30 pm, twenty inmates, known as a group called the Avengers, stormed the mess hall where Captain Glassock and others were on duty. \\"Within seconds, he (Captain Glassock), five other officers, and a food service worker were tackled and slammed to the floor. Inmates put knives to their throats and handcuffed them with their own handcuffs.\\" Although several hostages were taken throughout the day, none of them were seriously injured. However, over the course of the two-day upheaval, three inmates were killed for an assortment of reasons. \\"The inmates who initiated the riot were not prepared to take charge of it. Danny Lehman, the Avengers' president, was quickly agreed upon as best suited for the task of negotiating with authorities and presenting the demands to the media.\\" Yet, Lehman was not a part of the twenty men who began the riot. Governor Arch A. Moore, Jr. went to the penitentiary to talk with the inmates. This meeting set up a new list of rules and standards on which the prison would build. National and local news covered the story, as well as the inmates meeting with Governor Moore. =Decommissioning= Toward the end of its life as a prison, the facility was marked by many instances of riots and escapes. In the 1960s, the prison reached a peak population of about 2,000 inmates. With the building of more prisons, that number declined to 600 ‚Äì 700 inmates by 1995. The fate of the prison was sealed in a 1986 ruling by the West Virginia Supreme Court which stated that confinement to the 5 x cells constituted cruel and unusual punishment. Within nine years, West Virginia Penitentiary was closed as a prison. Most of the inmates were transferred to the Mt. Olive Correctional Complex in Fayette County, West Virginia. A smaller correctional facility was built a mile away in Moundsville to serve as a regional jail. =Executions= The original Old Sparky on display From 1899 to 1959, ninety-four men were executed at the prison. Hanging was the method of execution until 1949, with eighty-five men meeting that fate. The public could attend hangings, which were public until June 19, 1931. On that date, Frank Hyer was executed for murdering his wife. When the trap door beneath him was opened and his full weight settled into the noose, he was instantly decapitated. Following this event, attendance at hangings was by invitation only. The last man executed by hanging, Bud Peterson from Logan County, was buried in the prison's cemetery because his family refused to claim his body. Beginning in 1951, electrocution became the means of execution. The electric chair, nicknamed \\"Old Sparky\\", used by the prison was originally built by an inmate there, Paul Glenn. Nine men were electrocuted before the state prohibited capital punishment entirely in 1965. The original chair is on display in the facility and is included in the official tour. Training After the prison closed its doors as a state institution, the Moundsville Economic Development Council obtained a 25-year lease on the complex. The facility is used for training law enforcement and corrections practitioners with regular mock-riot drills. To assist teams in the planning and execution of scenarios, the West Virginia High Technology Consortium Foundation commissioned The 3D Model of the West Virginia Penitentiary, an interactive 3D model of the penitentiary. It made the software available to the public prior to conducting the 2009 Mock Prison Riot. Some previous training programs for law enforcement officials that took place here, such as the National Corrections and Law Enforcement Training and Technology Center, are now discontinued. Tourism Tours are available for tourists wishing to see the prison. The Elizabethtown Festival is held every May to celebrate and remember historic Moundsville. A haunted attraction called the \\"Dungeon of Horrors\\" is also set up for the Halloween season. Paranormal groups and enthusiast travel guides consider Moundsville Prison to be one of the most haunted prisons in the United States, with ghost stories originating as early as the 1930s. Legends include claims that the prison occupies the site of a Native American burial ground, and alleged hauntings by spirits of dead inmates. Appearances in media The prison has been featured in a variety of books, films, television shows, songs and video games. =Novels= Moundsville native Davis Grubb has written a couple of novels with Moundsville as the setting, Fools' Parade (also known as Dynamite Man from Glory Jail) and The Night of the Hunter. The penitentiary was featured as a significant part of each plot. =Film/TV= These works by Grubb have been adapted as major motion pictures. The Night of the Hunter was adapted into a film by Charles Laughton and James Agee in 1955. It stars Robert Mitchum and Shelley Winters. Fools' Parade, starring James Stewart, Kurt Russell, and George Kennedy, was adapted into a film in 1971. Prison scenes in the 2013 film Out of the Furnace were filmed on site at the penitentiary. The prison was the site for MTV's paranormal reality television series Fear. It was Season 1 Episode 1. The Hulu original series, Castle Rock, based on Stephen King's work, was filmed here. In the series, the penitentiary stands in as Shawshank State Prison. While the Ohio State Reformatory in Mansfield, Ohio was used for the 1994 movie The Shawshank Redemption, the showrunners of Castle Rock instead chose the West Virginia Penitentiary because of their desire to make the town around Shawshank more visible. External shots of the penitentiary were used for Season 1 Episode 9 of the Netflix Original Series Mindhunter West Virginia State Penitentiary and the town's history were featured as one of the haunted locations on the paranormal TV series Most Terrifying Places in America in the episode titled \\"Cursed Towns\\", which aired on the Travel Channel in 2018.https://www.travelchannel.com/shows/most- terrifying-places-in-america/episodes/cursed-towns The prison and its history was featured on an episode of Mysteries of the Abandoned during the TV series' 5th season which aired on the Science Channel on November 14, 2019.https://www.sciencechannel.com/tv-shows/mysteries-of-the-abandoned/full- episodes/curse-of-the-haunted-prison =Video games= The prison appears in the 2018 video game Fallout 76, where it is known as the \\"Eastern Regional Penitentiary.\\" See also *List of Registered Historic Places in West Virginia References External links * Category:1876 establishments in West Virginia Category:1986 riots Category:1995 disestablishments in West Virginia Category:Defunct prisons in West Virginia Category:Gothic Revival architecture in West Virginia Category:Government buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in West Virginia Category:Historic districts in Marshall County, West Virginia Category:History museums in West Virginia Category:Museums in Marshall County, West Virginia Category:National Register of Historic Places in Marshall County, West Virginia Category:Prison museums in the United States Category:Prison uprisings in the United States Category:Reportedly haunted locations in West Virginia Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in West Virginia Category:Moundsville, West Virginia ","title":"West Virginia Penitentiary"},{"id":"7715559","text":"Tommy Hilfiger brand is an example of a designer label. Armani is another example of luxury designer clothing label. The term designer label refers for clothing, luxury automobile manufacturers and other personal accessory items sold under an often prestigious marque which is commonly named after a designer, founder or location where the company was founded such as BMW. The term is most often applied to luxury goods. While members of the upper middle class, or the mass affluent, are perhaps the most commonly targeted customers of these designer labels, some marquees‚Äîsuch as Cartier, Rolex, Montblanc and the haute couture ‚Äî tend to a wealthier customer base. But almost every designer brand has merchandise that middle-class wouldn't normally be able to afford such as exotic skins, furs and hides, limited edition pieces, or things simply priced higher. Designer Label companies use their smaller and cheaper merchandise, aimed at the middle class, such as wallets, fashion jewellery, key-rings and small accessories, to make the majority of their income, whilst the more expensive pieces such as haute couture, high jewellery, hand-bags, shoes and even furnishings are usually reserved for the wealthier upper-class clientele. Many big designer labels focus on haute couture and marketing while licensing the production of their cheaper merchandise to others. In the eyewear industry for example brands like Burberry, Chanel, Armani and Prada license their brand names to market leaders like Luxottica. Many department stores themselves may be considered designer labels, such as Neiman Marcus, Harrods, David Jones and Daimaru. Designer labels are not only restricted to the fashion design industry. Many car and motorcycle companies such as Rolls Royce, Harley Davidson and Mercedes Benz are regarded as designer labels. These companies make their vehicles to a higher standard than the average manufacturers and many other attributes such leather used in the upholstery, woodwork and paneling, high levels of technology, extra safety and speed are employed to make for a better product. These vehicles are also in high demand all over the world, and waiting lists may be applied to some models such as the Rolls Royce Phantom and the Bugatti Veyron. Many people consider designer labels to be a status symbol. Some research indicates that products with designer labels on them are perceived as higher in quality and fashionability than the same products without designer labels. Other studys show evidence that brand names do influence consumers perception of price but not of quality of the products. The relationship between consumer products and social status is highly debated.

The Quartet has achieved widespread recognition, having given recitals in leading British concert halls and at music festivals in Britain and across Europe. They have also won several major prizes in string quartet and chamber music competitions. The Quartet is named for the outstanding twentieth-century Italian violin maker and restorer Simone Sacconi, whose book The Secrets of Stradivari is considered an indispensable reference for violin makers. Members The quartet retains its founding members, who are: *Ben Hancox, violin *Hannah Dawson, violin *Robin Ashwell, viola *Cara Berridge, 'cello About Since its formation at the Royal College of Music in 2001, the Sacconi Quartet has established a secure and substantial reputation. The Quartet is recognised for its unanimous and compelling ensemble, performing with style and commitment and consistently communicating with a fresh and imaginative approach. Its four founder members demonstrate a shared passion for string quartet repertoire, infectiously reaching out to audiences with their energy and enthusiasm. The Quartet have enjoyed a highly successful international career, performing regularly throughout Europe, at London's major venues, in recordings and radio broadcasts. The Sacconi is Quartet in Association at the Royal College of Music and Associate Artist at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre. The Sacconi Quartet is renowned for its vigorous and individual approach to music-making. In 2008, the Quartet held the inaugural Sacconi Chamber Music Festival in Folkestone, Kent. Now in its fifth year, the festival is an established event in the cultural calendar and is expanding year on year with challenging programming and exciting collaborations. The Sacconi Quartet has performed at all the major London venues including Wigmore Hall, Kings Place, Cadogan Hall, Queen Elizabeth Hall, Purcell Room and Conway Hall. They have travelled extensively throughout the rest of the UK and Europe to venues including Bridgewater Hall in Manchester, Musikverein in Vienna, Muziekgebouw in Amsterdam, L'Auditori in Barcelona and Auditorio Nacional de M√∫sica in Madrid as well as many venues in Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, France, Finland, Norway and the Czech Republic.

The Sacconi performed their 10th birthday celebratory concert at Kings Place to a sold-out hall. In Summer 2015 the quartet embarked on an exciting new immersive project called HEARTFELT. A radical reinterpretation of Beethoven's iconic String Quartet in A minor opus 132, HEARTFELT pushed the boundaries of chamber music through combining sound, light and touch, for a truly unique performance in which audience members connected with each performer's heartbeat through holding robotic ‚Äòhearts‚Äô. Developed in a unique collaboration with robotics and lighting designers and funded by Arts Council England, HEARTFELT received 4-star reviews from The Guardian and The Independent, and was described by the latter as ‚Äúa powerful way to experience the visceral physicality of Beethoven‚Äôs profound thanksgiving‚Äù. www.heartfelt.org.uk Premieres and collaborations To date the Quartet has given twenty world premi√®res and three British premi√®res, including quartets by Gy√∂rgy Kurt√°g, Robin Holloway, Paul Patterson, Timothy Salter, John Metcalf and Alun Hoddinott, and recently they performed as the solo string quartet on Paul McCartney's new song Come Home.

Many of them are direct evidence of the commission of war crimes such as the notorious Commando Order. Other orders provide evidence of crimes against humanity, such as the Hitler order establishing forced euthanasia of disabled people in 1939 under Action T4, and the Nacht und Nebel order for eliminating civilian resisters in occupied countries. Directive of 21 October 1938 On 21 October 1938, Hitler issued a new directive to the Wehrmacht to prepare for the \\"following eventualities\\": * Securing the borders of the Reich and protection against surprise air attacks * Liquidation of the remainder of the Czech state. It must be possible to smash at any time the remainder of the Czech state should it pursue an anti-German policy. * The occupation of Memelland. Action T4 Hitler's order for the Action T4 In 1939 Hitler issued an order which became the justification for killing disabled children and adults in Action T4. It laid the basis for the Holocaust since gassing was a favoured method of murdering the many victims. The SS staff who operated the gas chambers were later employed at Auschwitz and many other concentration camps and death camps. Fall Weiss directive On 3 April 1939, the directive for Fall Weiss (Case White) was ready. It was issued on 11 April. The first section, written by Hitler, began: German relations with Poland continue to be based on the principles of avoiding any disturbances. Should Poland, however, change her policy towards Germany, a final settlement might become necessary in spite of the Treaty in force with Poland. The aim then will be to destroy Polish military strength, and create in the East a situation which satisfies the requirements of National Defence. The free state of Danzig will be proclaimed a part of Reich territory by the outbreak of hostilities at the latest. The political leaders consider it their task in this case to isolate Poland if possible, that is to say, to limit the war to Poland only. The Wehrmacht had to be ready to carry out Fall Weiss at any time after 1 September 1939. Commissar Order, June 1941 The notorious Commissar Order (Kommissarbefehl), dated 6 June 1941, followed directly on the Barbarossa decree. It was called Instructions on the Treatment of Political Commissars and began:Soviet Prisoners of War: Forgotten Nazi Victims of World War II > In the struggle against Bolshevism, we must not assume that the enemy's > conduct will be based on principles of humanity or of international law. In > particular, hate-inspired, cruel and inhumane treatment of prisoners can be > expected on the part of all grades of political commissars, who are the real > leaders of resistance...To show consideration to these elements during this > struggle, or to act in accordance with international rules of war, is wrong > and endangers both our own security and the rapid pacification of conquered > territory...Political commissars have initiated barbaric, Asiatic methods of > warfare. Consequently, they will be dealt with immediately and with maximum > severity. As a matter of principle, they will be shot at once, whether > captured during operations or otherwise showing resistance. Nacht und Nebel, 7 December 1941 Nacht und Nebel (\\"Night and Fog\\") was a directive () of Adolf Hitler on 7 December 1941 that was originally intended to remove all political activists and resistance 'helpers', \\"anyone endangering German security\\" (die deutsche Sicherheit gef√§hrden) throughout Nazi Germany's occupied territories. The name was a direct reference to a magic spell involving the \\"Tarnhelm\\" (\\"stealth helmet\\") from Wagner's Rheingold. The Tarnhelm could make its wearer invisible and instantly transport him to another location. In February 1942, two months later, Armed Forces High Command Feldmarschall Wilhelm Keitel expanded it to include all persons in occupied countries who had been taken into custody and were still alive eight days later. The decree was meant to intimidate local populations into submission by denying friends and families of the missing any knowledge of their whereabouts or their fate. The prisoners were secretly transported to Germany, apparently vanishing without a trace, but in fact incarcerated in concentration camps. F√ºhrer Directive No. 46 F√ºhrer Directive No. 46 was issued on 18 August 1942 under the title \\"Instructions For Intensified Action Against Banditry [Bandenbek√§mpfung] In The East\\", marking the radicalisation of so-called anti-partisan warfare. The directive called on the security forces to act with \\"utter brutality\\" to achieve \\"complete extermination\\" of \\"gangs\\", while providing immunity from prosecution for any acts committed during \\"bandit-fighting\\" operations. The directive designated the SS as the organisation responsible for rear-area warfare in areas under civilian administration. In areas under military jurisdiction (the Army Group Rear Areas), the Army High Command had the overall responsibility. The directive declared the entire population of \\"bandit\\" (i.e. partisan-controlled) territories as enemy combatants. In practice, this meant that the aims of security warfare was not pacification, but complete destruction and depopulation of \\"bandit\\" and \\"bandit-threatened\\" territories, turning them into \\"dead zones\\" (Tote Zonen). Commando Order, October 1942 The Kommandobefehl (\\"Commando Order\\") was issued by Adolf Hitler on 18 October 1942 stating that all Allied commandos encountered by German forces in Europe and Africa should be killed immediately without trial, even in proper uniforms or if they attempted to surrender. Any commando or small group of commandos or a similar unit, agents, and saboteurs not in proper uniforms, who fell into the hands of the German military forces by some means other than direct combat (through the police in occupied territories, for instance) were to be handed over immediately to the Sicherheitsdienst (SD, Security Service). The order, which was issued in secret, made it clear that failure to carry out these orders by any commander or officer would be considered to be an act of negligence punishable under German military law. Nero Decree The Nero Decree was issued by Adolf Hitler on 19 March 1945, ordering the destruction of German infrastructure to prevent their use by Allied forces as they penetrated deep within Germany. It was officially titled Demolitions on Reich Territory Decree (Befehl betreffend Zerst√∂rungsma√ünahmen im Reichsgebiet) and has subsequently become known as the Nero Decree, after the Roman Emperor Nero, who supposedly engineered the Great Fire of Rome in 64 AD. It was countermanded by among others, Albert Speer, who wanted to preserve as much as possible for Germany following her defeat in 1945.

They were internment camps established by the German Army in World War II to hold Allied civilians, caught in areas that were occupied by the German Army. They included United States citizens caught in Europe by surprise when war was declared in December 1941 and citizens of the British Commonwealth caught in areas engulfed by the Blitzkrieg. Amongst the internees were British born citizens who were resident in the Channel Islands. In October 1941, Adolf Hitler ordered the internment of 8,000 British, in retaliation for the internment by the British Army of 800 Germans living in Iran. The order was not carried out until it was reissued by Hitler in September 1942. The German commander of the islands, based in Jersey, was ordered to deport to camps in Germany all British citizens not born in the islands. The numbers were reduced, with around 2,200 men, women and children being deported. Internment camps in Austria * Ilag XVIII Spittal Internment camps in Czechoslovakia * Ilag IV Eisenberg Internment camps in France 1940‚Äì1944 There were 219 internment camps in France during the Second World War. Several Ilags were set up in France by the German Army to hold citizens of the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth countries that were caught by the rapid advance during the Battle of France. The main camps were: =Besan√ßon= The camp at Besan√ßon was called Frontstalag 142, or Caserne Vauban. At the end of 1940, 2,400 women, mostly British, were interned in the Vauban barracks and another 500 old and sick in the St. Jacques hospital close by. In early 1941 many of them were released; the rest were transferred to Vittel. =Saint-Denis= The camp was located in the old barracks built in the middle of the 19th century at Saint-Denis, close to Paris. The camp was opened June 1940 and existed until liberated by the United States Army in August 1944. Part of the grounds were surrounded by barbed wire to provide open space for exercise. In early 1942, there were more than 1,000 male British internees in the camp. The meagre food rations were augmented by the International Red Cross packages, so that, overall, their diet was satisfactory. Life was tolerable because there was a good library and recreation was provided by sports activities and theatre.New Zealand report p.146 =Vittel= Also called Frontstalag 121, New Zealand report on civilian camps, p.95 this was one of the more hospitable internment camps as it was located in requisitioned hotels in this spa near Epinal in the Department Vosges. Most of the British families and single women were transferred here from St. Denis and Besan√ßon. In early 1942, women over 60, men over 75 and children under 16 were released. The overall population was thus reduced to about 2,400. The inmates included a number of American families and women. Provisions for recreation included a local theatre and a park with seven tennis courts. A young New Zealander and two British women escaped in August 1941 and made their way to England. =Other camps in France= * Ilag Clermont * Ilag Compi√®gne * Ilag Drancy * Ilag Giromagny * Ilag Rouen Internment camps in Germany World War II =Ilag V Liebenau= Propaganda photograph showing internees at Liebenau camp with Red Cross care packages, c.1940. A camp in , close to Meckenbeuren in W√ºrttemberg, on Lake Constance was opened in 1940 and operated until 1945. It was situated in a castle and four adjacent buildings. Originally it had been a mental hospital run by nuns. By orders of Hitler, about 700 of the patients were exterminated with injections to provide room for internees.Account of Angela Maranian The first internees were about 300 British citizens from Poland. More British were brought in 1941 from Belgium, Greece, Netherlands and other countries. The food rations were augmented with Red Cross packages. The guards were older German veterans of World War I and treated the internees well, as several of them had been prisoners of war in British camps and had been treated well. In January 1943 many of the married women were transferred to Vittel (see above). =Ilag V-B Biberach= Built in 1939 as barracks, this camp became an Ilag to accommodate Channel Island families and was located on a plateau northwest of Biberach an der Ri√ü in southeastern Baden-W√ºrttemberg. It consisted of 23 concrete huts that had previously served as Oflag V-B for officers who were prisoner of war. Initially, the camp was administered by the German Army, but in the spring of 1943 the administration was transferred to the Interior Ministry; this caused a worsening of food rations. Otherwise, the International Red Cross considered conditions in the camp to be satisfactory. In January 1943, the camp held 1,011 internees: 429 men, 437 women, and 145 children. 20 Channel Island civilians died in Biberach. =Ilag V-C Wurzach= This camp also held Channel Island families. It was located in the town of Bad Wurzach and southeastern Baden-W√ºrttemberg. Previously, it had been used as an oflag housing French officers. Conditions were less satisfactory because it was located in a three-story 18th-century castle that had recently been a monastery, and the rooms were dark and damp. 618 internees arrived at the end of October 1942, all of them families. In late 1944 72 Dutch Jews arrived from Bergen-Belsen. Most appeared to have English grandparents. The deportees now learned first hand about conditions elsewhere. 12 Channel Island civilians died in Wurzach. =Ilag VII Laufen and Tittmoning= Memorial plate for the internees who died in ILAG VII during WW II. You find the plate at the old cemetery in Laufen. British and American citizens were interned in Laufen and Tittmoning in Bavaria, on the border with Austria. In September 1942, British single men from the Channel Islands were sent here, where they found some Americans in residence. In 1943, the younger men over 16 who had parents in Biberach or Wurzach were moved to Laufen to release space. These two camps were always administered by the German Army. Frank Stroobant, the camp senior, was invited in April 1943 to attend an inspection in the forest of Katyn in Russia where a massacre of 22,000, mainly Polish army and police officers, by Soviet forces had been uncovered. He was the only civilian witness at the event From June 1943 the camp senior became Ambrose Sherwill. Boredom was a major problem. Some internees were permitted to undertake paid work outside camp. The moral view of whether work should be done was strongly debated in the camp, but as everyone was a private individual, it was up to each person to make their own decision. In April 1944, Laufen held 459 British internees (417 Channel Islanders) and 120 Americans, including Josef Nassy. 10 Channel Island internees died in Laufen during internment. =Other camps in Germany= * Ilag 6 Bad Godesberg * Ilag Bad Neuenahr * Ilag Buchenwald * Ilag Dachau * Ilag 6 Dorsten * Ilag 10 Sandbostel * Ilag VII/Z Tittmoning * Ilag 3 Treuenbrietzen * Ilag XIII W√ºlzburg Internment camps in the Netherlands * Ilag Haaren, North Brabant * Ilag Sint-Michielsgestel, North Brabant Internment camps in Poland * Ilag 21 Chludowo * Ilag (Oflag 6) Kreuzburg * Ilag (Stalag 344) Kreuzburg * Ilag VIII/Z Kreuzburg * Ilag Tost * Ilag VIII Tost * Ilag VIII/H Tost Repatriation * At least one small group of internees returned from Laufen to Jersey prior to D-Day in 1944.See references in THE GERMAN OCCUPATION OF JERSEY: THE WARTIME DIARY OF LESLIE SINEL, and also the identity card of Frank Renouf Clements (ref D/S/A/3/A256), held in the Jersey Archive * A small number of Guernsey internees, considered too ill to remain in Laufen, were repatriated individually as the occasion arose accompanied by a couple of German soldiers and a Guernsey internee in his capacity as Red Cross representative. The route taken was across occupied France to St Malo where they would embark by boat to Guernsey; the accompanying party would return after a few days. * After lengthy negotiations in Switzerland, 900 British internees, mostly elderly or ill, were exchanged in Lisbon for a similar number of Germans interned in South Africa in July 1944. * In September 1944, 125 elderly and infirm Channel Islanders were repatriated on the via Sweden to the UK. Following a three-day January trip by the Laufen senior, Ambrose Sherwill to Berlin to meet the Swiss delegation, 24 from Laufen were included in a further 212 being repatriated in April 1945. * The remainder of the Channel Islanders were repatriated after the camps were liberated by the French Army (Biberach) on 22 April 1945. Wurzach was liberated on 28 April 1945 by a French Moroccan armoured unit who were unaware of the internees. Laufen was liberated on 4 May 1945, by Americans of 40th Armoured Division.

She is a professor in the Computer Science Department at Stanford. Professional biography Monica Lam received a B.Sc. from University of British Columbia in 1980 and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University in 1987. Lam joined the faculty of Computer Science at Stanford University in 1988. She has contributed to the research of a wide range of computer systems topics including compilers, program analysis, operating systems, security, computer architecture, and high-performance computing. More recently, she is working in natural language processing, as faculty director of the Open Virtual Assistant Lab. The lab developed the open-source Almond voice assistant., which is sponsored by the National Science Foundation. Almond has received the Popular Science's Best of What's New award in 2019. Previously, Lam led the SUIF (Stanford University Intermediate Format) Compiler project, which produced a widely used compiler infrastructure known for its locality optimizations and interprocedural parallelization. Many of the compiler techniques she developed have been adopted by the industry. Her other research projects included the architecture and compiler for the CMU Warp machine, a systolic array of VLIW processors, and the Stanford DASH distributed shared memory machine. In 1998, she took a sabbatical leave from Stanford to help start Tensilica Inc., a company that specializes in configurable processor cores. In another research project, her program analysis group has developed a collection of tools for improving software security and reliability. They developed the first scalable context-sensitive inclusion-based pointer analysis and a freely available tool called BDDBDDB, that allows programmers to express context-sensitive analyses simply by writing Datalog queries. Other tools developed include Griffin, static and dynamic analysis for finding security vulnerabilities in Web applications such as SQL injection, a static and dynamic program query language called QL, a static memory leak detector called Clouseau, a dynamic buffer overrun detector called CRED, and a dynamic error diagnosis tool called DIDUCE. In the Collective project, her research group and she developed the concept of a livePC: subscribers of the livePC will automatically run the latest of the published PC virtual images with each reboot. This approach allows computers to be managed scalably and securely. In 2005, the group started a company called MokaFive to transfer the technology to industry. She also directed the MobiSocial laboratory at Stanford, as part of the Programmabile Open Mobile Internet 2020 initiative. Lam is also the cofounder of Omlet, which launched in 2014. Omlet is an open, decentralized social networking tool, based on an extensible chat platform. Lam chaired the ACM SIGPLAN Programming Languages Design and Implementation Conference in 2000, served on the Editorial Board of ACM Transactions on Computer Systems and numerous program committees for conferences on languages and compilers (PLDI, POPL), operating systems (SOSP), and computer architecture (ASPLOS, ISCA).

The population at the 2011 census was measured at 473. Its unusual name, ambo being the Latin for \\"both\\", originates from the merging of two originally separate villages called Wenden Magna (or Great Wenden) and Wenden Parva (or Little Wenden).  Situation  Wendens Ambo is approximately two miles south- west of the market town of Saffron Walden, fifteen miles south of Cambridge and forty miles north of London. Within the village is Audley End railway station which is the main station for Audley End House and Saffron Walden.  History  The earliest signs of settlement are from the Roman period. Remains of a villa were found during an excavation in 1853, and finds of flint tools from 300‚Äì200 BC suggest an even earlier settlement. It is likely that the farming community of Wenden probably started around the 6th and 7th centuries, taking its name from the valley in which it lies: Wendene. The Domesday Book contains the first written account of Wenden Magna and Wenden Parva. Wenden Magna was owned by Robert Gernon, a Frenchman who also had land in Stansted and Takeley. Wenden Parva was also owned by a Frenchman, William de Warenne. The Wendens passed through the Middle Ages as very ordinary English villages, with their parish church of St Mary the Virgin located in Wenden Magna. A third Wenden, higher up the valley to the west is Wenden Lofts (probably the \\"Loutes Wenden\\" mentioned in a legal record of 1470, where the nearby villages of \\"Arkysden\\" & \\"Elmedon\\" are also mentioned.)Plea Rolls of the Court of Common Pleas; National Archives; CP 40/837; http://aalt.law.uh.edu/AALT2/E4/CP40no837/bCP40no837dorses/IMG_0578.htm; sixth entry with John Serle as plaintiff During the 17th century work began to rebuild the village dwellings, some of which are still occupied today. Also at this time, on 23 March 1662, Wenden Magna and Wenden Parva were joined to create Wendens Ambo. The 18th and 19th centuries brought the Industrial Revolution and also the railway, providing opportunities for work elsewhere, leading to Wenden eventually becoming a commuter village.

Also relays to the following translators: History Florida State entered radio on January 21, 1949, when WFSU signed on as a student-run radio station at 660 AM. Due to the terms of its license, the signal was limited to the confines of the Florida State campus. It was on the air for three hours every night during the week, with a lineup of campus news, interviews, music and an occasional play. The station was forced off the air in April 1953 due to complaints that the signal was leaking off campus. Florida State applied for a low-powered FM license, and WFSU returned to the air at 91.5 FM in July 1954. Soon afterward, it joined the National Association of Educational Broadcasters, allowing it to significantly upgrade its programming with offerings from BBC World Service and Radio France. It also began carrying Seminoles football games after no commercial station would carry them. In 1970, WFSU-FM became a charter member of NPR, and was one of the 90 stations to carry the initial broadcast of All Things Considered. In the 1970s, it shifted to a format of mostly classical music. The station continued to grow during the 1980s, but was somewhat hampered by problems with its signal. Unlike most NPR stations of the time, it had no backup power source for its transmitter, resulting in frequent outages. The station's reception was also marginal at best in the northeastern part of the city, which is very hilly. To solve the problem, WFSU won approval for a new station on 88.9 FM, operating from a new tower northeast of Tallahassee. All NPR news and information programming moved there on October 14, 1990. Classical music remained on 91.5, which received new call letters, WFSQ. However, due to the legal structure of the changeover, the Federal Communications Commission considers WFSQ to be the same station as the old WFSU. To improve its coverage on the Georgia side of the market, Florida State signed on WFSL in 2003. WFSW signed on in 1996, providing Panama City with a second NPR service, alongside Gulf Coast Community College's WKGC-FM. Until WKGC dropped NPR in 2013, Panama City was one of the smallest cities in the country with separate NPR stations. Controversy In June 2011, it was revealed that WFSU will receive $2.8 million in funding for various services related to Florida government. This is despite the $4.8 million of funding to other public radio and television stations vetoed by Governor Rick Scott in May 2011.

This theory was advanced by Albert Bandura as an extension of his social learning theory. The theory states that when people observe a model performing a behavior and the consequences of that behavior, they remember the sequence of events and use this information to guide subsequent behaviors. Observing a model can also prompt the viewer to engage in behavior they already learned.Bandura, A., Social foundations of thought and action : a social cognitive theory. 1986, Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall.Bandura, A. (2008). Social cognitive theory of mass communication. In J. Bryant & M. B. Oliver (Eds.), Media Effects: Advances in Theory and Research (pp. 94-124). New York, NY: Routledge. In other words, people do not learn new behaviors solely by trying them and either succeeding or failing, but rather, the survival of humanity is dependent upon the replication of the actions of others. Depending on whether people are rewarded or punished for their behavior and the outcome of the behavior, the observer may choose to replicate behavior modeled. Media provides models for a vast array of people in many different environmental settings. History The conceptual roots for social cognitive theory come from Edwin B. Holt and Harold Chapman Brown's 1931 book theorizing that all animal action is based on fulfilling the psychological needs of \\"feeling, emotion, and desire\\". The most notable component of this theory is that it predicted a person cannot learn to imitate until they are imitated. In 1941, Neal E. Miller and John Dollard presented their book with a revision of Holt's social learning and imitation theory. They argued four factors contribute to learning: drives, cues, responses, and rewards. One driver is social motivation, which includes imitativeness, the process of matching an act to an appropriate cue of where and when to perform the act. A behavior is imitated depending on whether the model receives a positive or negative response consequences. Miller and Dollard argued that if one were motivated to learn a particular behavior, then that particular behavior would be learned through clear observations. By imitating these observed actions the individual observer would solidify that learned action and would be rewarded with positive reinforcement. The proposition of social learning was expanded upon and theorized by Canadian psychologist Albert Bandura. Bandura, along with his students and colleagues conducted a series of studies, known as the Bobo doll experiment, in 1961 and 1963 to find out why and when children display aggressive behaviors. These studies demonstrated the value of modeling for acquiring novel behaviors. These studies helped Bandura publish his seminal article and book in 1977 that expanded on the idea of how behavior is acquired, and thus built from Miller and Dollard's research. In Bandura's 1977 article, he claimed that Social Learning Theory shows a direct correlation between a person's perceived self-efficacy and behavioral change. Self- efficacy comes from four sources: \\"performance accomplishments, vicarious experience, verbal persuasion, and physiological states\\". In 1986, Bandura published his second book, which expanded and renamed his original theory. He called the new theory social cognitive theory. Bandura changed the name to emphasize the major role cognition plays in encoding and performing behaviors. In this book, Bandura argued that human behavior is caused by personal, behavioral, and environmental influences. In 2001, Bandura brought SCT to mass communication in his journal article that stated the theory could be used to analyze how \\"symbolic communication influences human thought, affect and action\\". The theory shows how new behavior diffuses through society by psychosocial factors governing acquisition and adoption of the behavior. In 2011, Bandura published a book chapter -- The Social and Policy Impact of Social Cognitive Theory‚Äîto extend SCT'S application in health promotion and urgent global issues, which provides insight into addressing global problems through a macro social lens, aiming at improving equality of individuals' lives under the umbrellas of SCT.Bandura, A. (2011). The Social and Policy Impact of Social Cognitive Theory. In M. Mark, S. Donaldson, & B. Campbell (Eds.), Social Psychology and Evaluation. (pp. 33-70). New York, NY:Guilford Press. SCT has been applied to many areas of human functioning such as career choice and organizational behavior as well as in understanding classroom motivation, learning, and achievement. Current status Social Cognitive Theory originated in psychology, but based on an unofficial November 2013 Google Scholar search, only 2 percent of articles published on SCT are in the pure psychology field. About 20 percent of articles are from Education and 16 percent from Business. The majority of publications using SCT, 56 percent, come from the field of Applied Health Psychology. The majority of current research in Health Psychology focuses on testing SCT in behavioral change campaigns as opposed to expanding on the theory. Campaign topics include: increasing fruit and vegetable intake, increasing physical activity,Freigoun, Mohammad T., C√©sar A. Mart√≠n, Alicia B. Magann, Daniel E. Rivera, Sayali S.

HIV education, and breastfeeding. Born in 1925, Bandura is still influencing the world with expansions of SCT. His recent work, published May 2011, focuses on how SCT impacts areas of both health and population in relation to climate change. He proposes that these problems could be solved through television serial dramas that show models similar to viewers performing the desired behavior. On health, Bandura writes that currently there is little incentive for doctors to write prescriptions for healthy behavior, but he believes the cost of fixing health problems start to outweigh the benefits of being healthy. Bandura argues that we are on the cusp of moving from a disease model (focusing on people with problems) to a health model (focusing on people being healthy) and SCT is the theory that should be used to further a healthy society. Specifically on Population, Bandura states that population growth is a global crisis because of its correlation with depletion and degradation of our planet's resources. Bandura argues that SCT should be used to increase birth control use, reduce gender inequality through education, and to model environmental conservation to improve the state of the planet. Overview Social cognitive theory is a learning theory based gists agree that the environment one grows up in contributes to behavior, the individual person (and therefore cognition) is just as important. People learn by observing others, with the environment, behavior, and cognition acting as primary factors that influence development in a reciprocal triadic relationship. Each behavior witnessed can change a person's way of thinking (cognition). Similarly, the environment one is raised in may influence later behaviors. For example, a caregiver's mindset (also cognition) determines the environment in which their children are raised. The core concepts of this theory are explained by Bandura through a schematization of triadic reciprocal causation. The schema shows how the reproduction of an observed behavior is influenced by getting the learner to believe in his or her personal abilities to correctly complete a behavior. # Behavioral: The response an individual receives after they perform a behavior (i.e. Provide chances for the learner to experience successful learning as a result of performing the behavior correctly). # Environmental: Aspects of the environment or setting that influence the individual's ability to successfully complete a behavior (i.e. Make environmental conditions conducive for improved self-efficacy by providing appropriate support and materials). It is important to note that learning can occur without a change in behavior. According to J.E. Ormrod's general principles of social learning, while a visible change in behavior is the most common proof of learning, it is not absolutely necessary. Social learning theorists believe that because people can learn through observation alone, their learning may not necessarily be shown in their performance. These are interdependent on each other and its influence can be directly linked with individual or group psychological behavior.Stajkovic, A., and Luthans, F. (2003). ‚ÄúSocial Cognitive Theory and Self-Efficacy: Implication for Motivation Theory and Practice.‚Äù Motivation and Work Behavior, by Lyman W. Porter et al., McGraw-Hill/Irwin, 2003, pp. 126‚Äì139. According to Alex Stajkovic and Fred Luthans it is critically important to recognize that the relative influences exerted by one, two, or three interacting factors on motivated behavior will vary depending on different activities, different individuals and different circumstances. Theoretical foundations = Human agency = Social cognitive theory is proposed in an agentic perspective, which suggests that, instead of being just shaped by environments or inner forces, individuals are self-developing, self-regulating, self-reflecting and proactive. Specifically, human agency operates within three modes: * Individual Agency: A person‚Äôs own influence on the environment; * Proxy Agency: Another person‚Äôs effort on securing the individual‚Äôs interests; * Collective Agency: A group of people work together to achieve the common benefits. Human agency has four core properties: * Intentionality: Individuals‚Äô active decision on engaging in certain activities; * Forethought: Individuals‚Äô ability to anticipate the outcome of certain actions; * Self-reactiveness: Individuals‚Äô ability to construct and regulate appropriate behaviors; * Self-reflectiveness: Individuals‚Äô ability to reflect and evaluate the soundness of their cognitions and behaviors. = Human capability = Evolving over time, human beings are featured with advanced neural systems, which enable individuals to acquire knowledge and skills by both direct and symbolic terms. Four primary capabilities are addressed as important foundations of social cognitive theory: symbolizing capability, self-regulation capability, self-reflective capability, and vicarious capability. # Symbolizing Capability: People are affected not only by direct experience but also indirect events. Instead of merely learning through laborious trial-and-error process, human beings are able to symbolically perceive events conveyed in messages, construct possible solutions, and evaluate the anticipated outcomes. # Self-regulation Capability: Individuals can regulate their own intentions and behaviors by themselves. Self-regulation lies on both negative and positive feedback systems, in which discrepancy reduction and discrepancy production are involved. That is, individuals proactively motivate and guide their actions by setting challenging goals and then making effort to fulfill them. In doing so, individuals gain skills, resources, self-efficacy and beyond. # Self- reflective Capability: Human beings can evaluate their thoughts and actions by themselves, which is identified as another distinct feature of human beings. By verifying the adequacy and soundness of their thoughts through enactive, various, social, or logical manner, individuals can generate new ideas, adjust their thoughts, and take actions accordingly. # Vicarious Capability: One critical ability human beings feature is the ability to adopt skills and knowledge from information communicated through a wide array of mediums. By vicariously observing others‚Äô actions and their consequences, individuals can gain insights into their own activities. Vicarious capability is of great value to human beings‚Äô cognitive development in nowadays, in which most of our information encountered in our lives derives from the mass media than trial- and-error processes. Theoretical components = Modeling = Social cognitive theory revolves around the process of knowledge acquisition or learning directly correlated to the observation of models. The models can be those of an interpersonal imitation or media sources. Effective modeling teaches general rules and strategies for dealing with different situations. To illustrate that people learn from watching others, Albert Bandura and his colleagues constructed a series of experiments using a Bobo doll. In the first experiment, children were exposed to either an aggressive or non-aggressive model of either the same sex or opposite sex as the child. There was also a control group. The aggressive models played with the Bobo doll in an aggressive manner, while the non-aggressive models played with other toys. They found that children who were exposed to the aggressive models performed more aggressive actions toward the Bobo doll afterward, and that boys were more likely to do so than girls. Following that study, Albert Bandura tested whether the same was true for models presented through media by constructing an experiment he called Bobo Doll Behavior: A Study of Aggression. In this experiment Bandura exposed a group of children to a video featuring violent and aggressive actions. After the video he then placed the children in a room with a Bobo doll to see how they behaved with it. Through this experiment, Bandura discovered that children who had watched the violent video subjected the dolls to more aggressive and violent behavior, while children not exposed to the video did not. This experiment displays the social cognitive theory because it depicts how people reenact behaviors they see in the media. In this case, the children in this experiment reenacted the model of violence they directly learned from the video. Observations should include: * Attention Observers selectively give attention to specific social behavior depending on accessibility, relevance, complexity, functional value of the behavior or some observer's personal attributes such as cognitive capability, value preference, preconceptions. * Retention Observe a behavior and subsequent consequences, then convert that observation to a symbol that can be accessed for future reenactments of the behavior. Note: When a positive behavior is shown a positive reinforcement should follow, this parallel is similar for negative behavior. * Production refers to the symbolic representation of the original behavior being translated into action through reproduction of the observed behavior in seemingly appropriate contexts. During reproduction of the behavior, a person receives feedback from others and can adjust their representation for future references. * Motivational process reenacts a behavior depending on responses and consequences the observer receives when reenacting that behavior. Modeling does not limit to only live demonstrations but also verbal and written behaviour can act as indirect forms of modeling. Modeling not only allows students to learn behaviour that they should repeat but also to inhibit certain behaviours. For instance, if a teacher glares at one student who is talking out of turn, other students may suppress this behavior to avoid a similar reaction. Teachers model both material objectives and underlying curriculum of virtuous living. Teachers should also be dedicated to the building of high self-efficacy levels in their students by recognizing their accomplishments. = Outcome expectancies = To learn a particular behavior, people must understand what the potential outcome is if they repeat that behavior. The observer does not expect the actual rewards or punishments incurred by the model, but anticipates similar outcomes when imitating the behavior (called outcome expectancies), which is why modeling impacts cognition and behavior. These expectancies are heavily influenced by the environment that the observer grows up in; for example, the expected consequences for a DUI in the United States of America are a fine, with possible jail time, whereas the same charge in another country might lead to the infliction of the death penalty. For example, in the case of a student, the instructions the teacher provides help students see what outcome a particular behaviour leads to. It is the duty of the teacher to teach a student that when a behaviour is successfully learned, the outcomes are meaningful and valuable to the students. = Self-efficacy = Social cognitive theory posits that learning most likely occurs if there is a close identification between the observer and the model and if the observer also has a good deal of self-efficacy. Self‚Äìefficacy is the extent to which an individual believes that they can master a particular skill. Self-efficacy beliefs function as an important set of proximal determinants of human motivation, affect, and action‚Äîwhich operate on action through motivational, cognitive, and affective intervening processes. According to Bandura, self- efficacy is \\"the belief in one's capabilities to organize and execute the courses of action required to manage prospective situations\\". Bandura and other researchers have found an individual's self-efficacy plays a major role in how goals, tasks, and challenges are approached. Individuals with high self-efficacy are more likely to believe they can master challenging problems and they can recover quickly from setbacks and disappointments. Individuals with low self-efficacy tend to be less confident and don't believe they can perform well, which leads them to avoid challenging tasks. Therefore, self- efficacy plays a central role in behavior performance. Observers who have high level of self-efficacy are more likely to adopt observational learning behaviors. Self-efficacy can be developed or increased by: * Mastery experience, which is a process that helps an individual achieve simple tasks that lead to more complex objectives. * Social modeling provides an identifiable model that shows the processes that accomplish a behavior. * Improving physical and emotional states refers to ensuring a person is rested and relaxed prior to attempting a new behavior. The less relaxed, the less patient, the more likely they won't attain the goal behavior. * Verbal persuasion is providing encouragement for a person to complete a task or achieve a certain behavior. For example, students become more effortful, active, pay attention, highly motivated and better learners when they perceive that they have mastered a particular task. It is the duty of the teacher to allow student to perceive in their efficacy by providing feedback to understand their level of proficiency. Teachers should ensure that the students have the knowledge and strategies they need to complete the tasks. Self-efficacy has also been used to predict behavior in various health related situations such as weight loss, quitting smoking, and recovery from heart attack. In relation to exercise science, self-efficacy has produced some of the most consistent results revealing an increase in participation in exercise. = Identification = Identification allows the observer to feel a one-to-one similarity with the model, and can thus lead to a higher chance of the observer following through with the modeled action. People are more likely to follow behaviors modeled by someone with whom they can identify. The more commonalities or emotional attachments perceived between the observer and the model, the more likely the observer learns and reenacts the modeled behavior. Applications = Mass communication =  Media contents studies  Social cognitive theory is often applied as a theoretical framework of studies pertained to media representation regarding race, gender, age and beyond. Social cognitive theory suggested heavily repeated images presented in mass media can be potentially processed and encoded by the viewers (Bandura, 2011). Media content analytic studies examine the substratum of media messages that viewers are exposed to, which could provide an opportunity to uncover the social values attached to these media representations. Although media contents studies cannot directly test the cognitive process, findings can offer an avenue to predict potential media effects from modeling certain contents, which provides evidence and guidelines for designing subsequent empirical work.  Media effects studies  Social cognitive theory is pervasively employed in studies examining attitude or behavior changes triggered by the mass media. As Bandura suggested, people can learn how to perform behaviors through media modeling. SCT has been widely applied in media studies pertained to sports, health, education and beyond. For instance, Hardin and Greer in 2009 examined the gender-typing of sports within the theoretical framework of social cognitive theory, suggesting that sports media consumption and gender- role socialization significantly related with gender perception of sports in American college students. In health communication, social cognitive theory has been applied in research related to smoking cessation, HIV prevention, safe sex behaviors, and so on. For example, Martino, Collins, Kanouse, Elliott, and Berry in 2005 examined the relationship between the exposure to television‚Äôs sexual content and adolescents‚Äô sexual behavior through the lens of social cognitive theory, confirming the significant relationship between the two variables among white and African American groups; however, no significant correlation was found between the two variables in the ethic group of Hispanics, indicating that peer norm could possibly serve as a mediator of the two examined variables. = Public health =  Physical Activity  Albert Bandura defines perceived self-efficacy as ‚Äúpeople's beliefs about their capabilities to produce designated levels of performance that exercise influence over events that affect their lives.‚Äù Self-efficacy is just one of six constructs that SCT is based on; the other five include reciprocal determinism, behavioral capability, observational learning, reinforcements, and expectations. A lack of physical activity has been shown to contribute to heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and cancer even in individuals without any other risk factors. Social cognitive theory can be helpful in identifying motivating factors that lead to increased physical activity across age and gender. A study by Yael Netz and Shulamith Raviv in 2004 found positive correlations between high levels of self-efficacy when compared to physical activity. These findings suggest the best motivational method to increase the rate of physical activity is one that first increases perceived self-efficacy. As applied to public health campaigns, the first symptom to address is low levels of perceived self-efficacy rather than low levels of physical activity, since addressing the former may rectify the latter. A different study conducted in 2015 observed similar results. The goal of this study was to identify if SCT could be used to ‚Äú‚Ä¶improve physical activity (PA) interventions by identifying which variables to target to maximize intervention impact.‚Äù By following 204 overweight men over the course of a three-month weight loss program, researchers applied a longitudinal, latent variable structural equation model to test SCT-related constructs including self-efficacy, outcome expectations, intention and social support as they apply toward self-reported changes in physical activity level. Researchers found self-efficacy as the most important indicator for physical activity, while noting a non-zero effect of intention on increased physical activity. As such, weight loss programs focused on increasing the physical activity levels of participants should aim to increase participant self-efficacy in order to achieve desirable results. Physical activity levels, on average, decline during one‚Äôs life ‚Äì particularly during adolescence. SCT can be used to explain the most prevalent contributing factors to this marked decrease in physical activity among adolescents and then develop appropriate intervention methods to best change this phenomenon. One study in particular addresses this subject through the SCT framework. Researchers mailed questionnaires to a random sample of 937 undergraduate students in the U.S. to measure the influence of personal, behavioral, and environmental factors on exercise behavior change. For both men and women, increased self-efficacy was the most important predictor in signifying positive changes to exercise behavior and physical activity. SCT can be applied to public health campaigns in an attempt to foster a more healthy public through exercise; as it relates, multiple studies find self-efficacy as the most important variable in predicting high- or low-levels of physical activity.  AIDS  Miller's 2005 study found that choosing the proper gender, age, and ethnicity for models ensured the success of an AIDS campaign to inner city teenagers. This occurred because participants could identify with a recognizable peer, have a greater sense of self-efficacy, and then imitate the actions to learn the proper preventions and actions.Miller, Katherine (2005). Communication Theories: Perspectives, Processes, and Contexts (2nd ed.). New York, New York: McGraw-Hill.  Breastfeeding  A study by Azza Ahmed in 2009 looked to see if there would be an increase in breastfeeding by mothers of preterm infants when exposed to a breastfeeding educational program guided by SCT. Sixty mothers were randomly assigned to either participate in the program or they were given routine care. The program consisted of SCT strategies that touched on all three SCT determinants: personal ‚Äì showing models performing breastfeeding correctly to improve self-efficacy, behavioral ‚Äìweekly check-ins for three months reinforced participants' skills, environmental ‚Äì mothers were given an observational checklist to make sure they successfully completed the behavior. The author found that mothers exposed to the program showed significant improvement in their breastfeeding skills, were more likely to exclusively breastfeed, and had fewer problems then the mothers who were not exposed to the educational program.Ahmed, A. (2009). Effect of Breastfeeding Educational Program Based of Bandura Social Cognitive Theory on Breastfeeding Outcomes among Mothers of Preterm Infants. Midwest Nursing Research Society Conference. Accessed November 2011. http://hdl.handle.net/10755/160761 Morality Social cognitive theory emphasizes a large difference between an individual's ability to be morally competent and morally performing. Moral competence involves having the ability to perform a moral behavior, whereas moral performance indicates actually following one's idea of moral behavior in a specific situation.Santrock, J.W. (2008). A Topical Approach to Lifespan Development (M. Ryan, Ed., 4th ed.). New York, NY: McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. (Original work published 2002), pp. 26, 30, 478 Moral competencies include: * what an individual is capable of * what an individual knows * what an individual's skills are * an individual's awareness of moral rules and regulations * an individual's cognitive ability to construct behaviors As far as an individual's development is concerned, moral competence is the growth of cognitive-sensory processes; simply put, being aware of what is considered right and wrong. By comparison, moral performance is influenced by the possible rewards and incentives to act a certain way. For example, a person's moral competence might tell them that stealing is wrong and frowned upon by society; however, if the reward for stealing is a substantial sum, their moral performance might indicate a different line of thought. Therein lies the core of social cognitive theory. For the most part, social cognitive theory remains the same for various cultures. Since the concepts of moral behavior did not vary much between cultures (as crimes like murder, theft, and unwarranted violence are illegal in virtually every society), there is not much room for people to have different views on what is morally right or wrong. The main reason that social cognitive theory applies to all nations is because it does not say what is moral and immoral; it simply states that we can acknowledge these two concepts. Our actions in real-life scenarios are based on whether we believe the action is moral and whether the reward for violating our morals is significant enough, and nothing else.  Limitations  = Modelling and mass media = In series TV programming, according to social cognitive theory, the awarded behaviors of liked characters are supposed to be followed by viewers, while punished behaviors are supposed to be avoided by media consumers. However, in most cases, protagonists in TV shows are less likely to experience the long-term suffering and negative consequences caused by their risky behaviors, which could potentially undermine the punishments conveyed by the media, leading to a modeling of the risky behaviors. Nabi and Clark conducted experiments about individual‚Äôs attitudes and intentions consuming various portrayals of one-night stand sex‚Äì unsafe and risky sexual behavior, finding that individuals who had not previously experienced one night stand sex, consuming media portrayals of this behavior could significantly increase their expectations of having a one night stand sex in the future, although negative outcomes were represented in TV shows.

They released two studio albums and were signed to RCA Records. Papa Vegas was founded in Grand Rapids, Michigan, where vocalist Joel Ferguson and guitarist Pete Dunning first began playing together.[ Papa Vegas] at Allmusic Dunning and Ferguson collaborated for three years before parting ways for individual projects, and Ferguson played under the name \\"Papa Vegas\\" with a variety of other musicians. After playing with Papa Vegas at a battle of the bands competition, they were heard by Brian Vander Ark, then lead singer of The Verve Pipe, who signed them to his Sid Flips label and produced their debut EP, Grounded, with Pete Dunning back on lead guitar, Scott Stefanski on drums, and original bassist Mick Force. Sid Flips was folded into RCA, and the group was set up with Don Gilmore to produce their debut full-length album. Tom Lord-Alge mixed; the result was released as Hello Vertigo in April 1999. All songs on the album were written by Joel Ferguson with the exception of \\"Sermon Underground\\", which was co- written by Joel Ferguson and Pete Dunning. Their biggest hit single was \\"Bombshell\\", which peaked at #20 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart in 1999.[ Billboard Singles], Allmusic.com Following the album's release, they toured with the Verve Pipe and also Kent, a critically acclaimed band from Stockholm then touring the US under RCA's European label, and had a lesser hit with the release of \\"Something Wrong\\" but the full-length did not sell as well as hoped, and no further hit singles followed. The group was dropped from the RCA label in March 2000 and split up shortly afterward. In December 2004, the band reunited to play a large venue show with The Verve Pipe. The show was a success, and they repeated it in December 2005. Ferguson, Stefanski and Dunning re-grouped for various projects on and off in the years that followed, most notably Miles to Mars. Pete Dunning went on to play in the Grand Rapids groups Molly, White Rabbit And Barrel Bones while Scott Stefanski and Joel Ferguson played in The Verve Pipe. In January 2009 Papa Vegas re-grouped as a five piece with John Connors replacing Force on bass, and adding Randy Tate on keyboards. The band is currently playing shows in their home state of Michigan and is working on a forthcoming album to be released in early 2010 on their own Shiver Music label.

The Type 89B model was the world's first mass-produced diesel engine tank. The tank was armed with a short-barrel 57 mm cannon for knocking out pillboxes and masonry fortifications, and proved effective in campaigns in Manchuria and China, as the Chinese National Revolutionary Army had only three tank battalions to oppose them, which consisted primarily of Vickers export models, German Panzer Is, and Italian CV33 tankettes. The Type 89 was a 1920s design medium tank, built to support the infantry, and thus lacked the armor or armament of 1940s generation Allied armor; it was regarded as obsolete by the time of the 1939 battles of Khalkhin Gol, against the Soviet Union. The code designation \\"I-Go\\" comes from the katakana letter [„Ç§] for ‚Äúfirst‚Äù and the kanji [Âè∑] for \\"number\\". The designation is also transliterated Chi-Ro and sometimes \\"Yi-Go\\". Experimental tank No.1 (Ë©¶Ë£Ω1Âè∑Êà¶Ëªä), 1927 (Imperial year 2587) History and development The Type 89 evolved from Japan's first domestic tank project initiated by the Imperial Japanese Army's Osaka Technical Arsenal in 1925. The original plan was for two types of tanks to be created. A light tank at 10-ton based on the French Renault FT tank and a 20-ton design modeled after the Vickers Medium tank. By February 1927, the Type 87 Chi-I medium tank was ready for trials. However, it was 20-ton and under-powered. The weight of the initial prototype and its low speed did not impress the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff Office, and a new requirement was issued for a lighter tank, with a nominal weight. The new design was modeled after the Vickers Medium C which had been bought by the Japanese Army in March 1927. By April 1928, the new light tank design was finished. The prototype of the was completed in 1929 and designated as the Type 89. Later, the Type 89 was re-classified as a \\"medium tank\\" because the weight increased to over 10 tons due to several improvements. As the army's Sagami Arsenal lacked the capacity for mass production, a contract was awarded to Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, which built a new tank factory to specifically produce this model. Production of the Type 89 began in 1931 and it soon became the main battle tank of the Japanese Army. Although the Type 89 was well regarded by the army, there were several small problems to be rectified, notably a gap under the mantlet on early models that allowed rifle fire to enter the turret. Work continued on improving the Type 89 after the production started, and as a result variants were developed. Design Type 89 medium tank Ko early model. The Type 89 required a crew of four (commander/gunner, loader, driver and hull gunner). The design of the Type 89 was relatively conventional with a forward-mounted gun turret carrying the main armament, a Type 90 57 mm gun that was complemented by two Type 91 6.5 mm machine guns. One was located in the front hull and the other placed in a turret ball mount pointed towards the rear, a practice followed with most Japanese tanks. The Type 90 57 mm tank gun had a barrel length of (L14.9) el angle of fire of ‚àí15 to +20 degrees, AZ angle of fire of 20 degrees, muzzle velocity of , and could penetrate of 20 mm of armor at 500 m (0.8 in/550 yd). During the later stages of World War II, HEAT shells were developed to provide greater penetration of enemy armor.Weekly Intelligence bulletins, Vol. I, Nos. 1 to 52, 14 July 1944 to 9 July 1945. Report No. 11-c(3), USSBS Index Section 6 Rather than using soft iron armor, as on the earlier Chi-I, the designers chose to use steel plate armor developed by the Nihon Seikosho Company (JSW). The type of armor was referred to as 'Niseko steel', an abbreviation of \\"Nihonseikosho\\".Taki's Imperial Japanese Army: \\"The Development of Imperial Japanese Tanks\\" The Type 89 was driven through the rear drive sprocket and featured nine bogies, mounted in pairs on each side, with the forward bogie on an independent suspension. Five smaller return wheels were mounted along a steel girder. The Type A could only communicate with signal flags. Some vehicles were provided with two searchlights for night operations. Later the Type 94 Mk 4 Hei (1934 model) radio communication device with range of 0.6 miles and weight of 198 lb, linked with a radio antenna of in a reverse L shape was installed. Variants * - The initial production model had a water-cooled 6-cylinder gasoline engine and mounted a machine gun on the right side of the hull. This design could attain only 15.5 km/h, and was also limited by the severe winter climate in northern China. A total of 113 tanks were produced. Top view of Type 89B I-Go Otsu * - The Ko was superseded in production from 1934 by the model Otsu with an air-cooled Mitsubishi A6120VD 120 hp diesel engine. The improved model had a new \\"asymmetric shaped\\" gun turret complete with a cupola for the commander, and with the machine gun relocated to the left side of the hull. The multiple armor plates of the front hull were replaced by a single shallow-sloped frontal armor plate which provided more protection for the driver. However, the major difference between the versions was the Mitsubishi air-cooled 6-cylinder diesel engine, which had several advantages: lower vulnerability to fire than a gasoline engine, better fuel economy, and greater torque at lower revolutions. A diesel engine was also preferred by the Japanese Army because more diesel fuel than gasoline could be produced per barrel of oil. A total of 291 Otsu tanks were produced. The Type 89B Otsu version was the first mass-produced tank with a diesel engine. Combat history Japanese tanks moving toward Manila, January 1942. The Type 89 served with Japanese infantry divisions and first saw combat use during the First Battle of Shanghai in 1932. The short-barreled 57 mm gun was effective at destroying machine gun nests and its armor, although thin, was enough to stop small arms fire. The relatively low speed of was not an issue in these types of operations. The following year, the Japanese Army formed its first independent armor force by creating three regiments armed with the Type 89, each consisting of two companies with ten tanks each. Three more regiments were formed in 1934. It was deployed for infantry support operations in the Second Sino-Japanese War and in various campaigns throughout China after 1937. After the out-break of war with China, the peacetime budgetary limitations were removed and the more capable and expensive Mitsubishi Chi-Ha model was accepted as the new Type 97 medium tank by the army to replace the Type 89. Type 89s were the main medium tank of the Japanese military through 1937. =Battle of Khalkhin Gol= Type 89 prior to the Battle of Khalkhin Gol On the evening of 2 July 1939, during the Battles of Khalkhin Gol, the Japanese Army's 1st Tank Corps, commanded by Lt. General Yasuoka Masaomi, launched an offensive against the Soviet Union's 11th Tank and 7th Armored brigades. The 1st Tank Corps consisted of the 3rd Tank Regiment and 4th Tank Regiment; of which the 3rd regiment consisted of 26 Type 89s, four Type 97 medium tanks, seven Type 94 tankettes, and four Type 97 tankettes, and the 4th regiment contained 35 Type 95s, eight Type 89s, and three Type 94 tankettes respectively. In this battle, the Type 97 medium tank was a newly fielded machine, and was primarily reserved for home units, as well as transitioning into Japanese Army forces stationed in China (Manchuria). The 3rd Tank Regiment had, after charging through Soviet artillery barrages, successfully overrun the Soviet motorized infantry and taken the high ground, which had been quickly abandoned by the Soviets. However, by 2100 hours, Soviet counter battery fire had begun pounding the newly taken position, and the 3rd Tank re- positioned themselves behind the objective. The 4th Tank Regiment, which had become separated from the 3rd Tank Regiment, advanced upon an objective under the cover of a thunderstorm that masked their movements but exposed the Soviet positions. The 4th Tank Regiment continued to advance, when suddenly a shift in the lightning flashes illuminated the advancing Japanese tanks, whereupon the Soviets immediately opened fire with anti-tank guns, heavy machine guns, and artillery. However, the range was so close that the Soviet artillery could not depress their guns far enough, and the 4th Tank Regiment was ordered to charge at about 0020 hours (12:20 AM). Soviet shells passed wildly over the charging tanks as they penetrated over a thousand yards into the Soviet lines. Now isolated, and deep within the Soviet lines, the 4th Tank Regiment moved several thousands yards where they met up with Japanese infantry. The 4th Tank Regiment had expended 1,100 37 mm and 129 57 mm tank shells during the fight, as well as about 16,000 machine gun rounds. Of the approximate 73 light and medium Japanese tanks from both regiments committed to the offensive, 13 were damaged beyond repair by Soviet gunfire, about 14 others were repaired after major overhauls, and 17 tanks were repaired in the field. Soviet forces concluded that the 1st Tank Corps had penetrated the defenses of their 9th Armored Brigade and 149th Infantry Regiment and had reached Soviet artillery positions. =Other service= Type 89 \\"I-Go\\" on display at the United States Army Ordnance Museum. By 1942 the Type 89 was gradually being withdrawn from front-line combat service, but many units saw action in the Battle of the Philippines, Battle of Malaya, and Burma campaign, and continued to be used in China. They were also often used in static defense positions in the Japanese- occupied islands of the Netherlands East Indies and in the South Seas Mandate, but with their weak armor and low muzzle velocity main gun they were a poor match for the American M4 Sherman. During the early stages of the First Indochina War, France set up an ad hoc unit of French and Japanese armour called the Commando Blind√© du Cambodge from tanks left over from the Japanese invasion of French Indochina. This unit included one Type 89B tank.Dunstan, Vietnam Tracks: Armor in Battle 1945-1975, pp. 10‚Äì11.

It was noted by ancient geographers and historians as a small island off Locris, in the Opuntian Gulf, said to have been torn asunder from the mainland by an earthquake. In the first year of the Peloponnesian War this previously uninhabited island was fortified by the Athenians to prevent Locrian pirates attacking Euboea. In the sixth year of the war a part of the Athenian works was destroyed by the sea, with half the ships on the beach destroyed.

It featured the sounds of old-school Soul music, with a blend of jazz improvisation. In the beginning years, the group's founding members were busy freelancing for other acts besides the Soul Enterprise, such as Dr. Alban and Jennifer Brown. A period of instability followed, with many different substitute musicians playing in the band. The group went through major reforms and a complete change of members followed under the leadership of guitarist Zak Keith in 1992. The new line-up of first-call musicians included some of Stockholm's best, many considered to be world-class musicians, such as Morgan √Ögren (drums), Anders Johnsson (bass), Micke Wennergrund (drums), Lasse Pollack (keyboards), Magnus Lindgren (Saxophone), Micke S√∂rensen (trumpet), Mia Gejrot, Anna Sandberg-H√§ll and Tonja Hedtj√§rn (voc). Magnus Lindgren went on to play with Herbie Hancock at age 18; Micke S√∂rensen went on to work with former Supremes member Mary Wilson. Lasse Pollack toured with Glenn Hughes in Japan. The Soul Enterprise was voted best Soul band of Scandinavia by Fasching Jazz Club in 1998.

During hydrochloric acid secretion in the stomach, the gastric parietal cells extract chloride anions, carbon dioxide, water and sodium cations from the blood plasma and in turn release bicarbonate back into the plasma after forming it from carbon dioxide and water constituents. This is to maintain the plasma's electrical balance, as the chloride anions have been extracted. The bicarbonate content causes the venous blood leaving the stomach to be more alkaline than the arterial blood delivered to it. The alkaline tide is neutralised by a secretion of H\\\\+ into the blood during HCO3‚àí secretion in the pancreas. Postprandial (i.e., after a meal) alkaline tide lasts until the acids in food absorbed in the small intestine reunite with the bicarbonate that was produced when the food was in the stomach. Thus, alkaline tide is self-limited and normally lasts less than two hours. Postprandial alkaline tide has also been shown to be a causative agent of calcium oxalate urinary stones in cats, and potentially in other species.McGavin, MD., Zachary, JF. Pathologic Basis of Veterinary Disease, Fourth Edition, Mosby, 2007, pp. 680‚Äì686.

Typically NMR tubes come in 5 mm diameters but 10 mm and 3 mm samples are known. It is important that the tubes are uniformly thick and well-balanced to ensure that NMR tube spins at a regular rate (i.e., they do not wobble), usually about 20 Hz in the NMR spectrometer. Construction NMR tubes are typically made of borosilicate glass. They are available in seven and eight inch lengths; a 5 mm tube outer diameter is most common, but 3 mm and 10 mm outer diameters are available as well. Where boron NMR is desired, quartz NMR tubes containing low concentrations of boron (as opposed to borosilicate glass) are available. Specialized closures such as J. Young valves and screwcap closures are available aside from more common polyethylene caps. Two common specifications for NMR tubes are concentricity and camber. Concentricity refers to the variation in the radial centers, measured at the inner and outer walls. Camber refers to the \\"straightness\\" of the tube. Poor values for either may cause poorer quality spectra by reducing the homogeneity of the sample. In particular, an NMR tube which has poor camber may wobble when rotated, giving rise to spinning side bands. With modern manufacturing techniques even cheap tubes give good spectra for routine applications. Sample preparation Left to right: Flame, septum and polyethylene cap sealed NMR tubes Usually, only a small sample is dissolved in an appropriate solvent. For 1H NMR experiments, this will usually be a deuterated solvent such as CDCl3. Sufficient solvent should be used in order to fill the tube by 4‚Äì5 cm (depending on the spectrometer). Protein NMR is usually performed in a 90% H2O (or buffer)/10% D2O mixture. The sample may be sonicated or agitated to aid dissolution, and solids are removed via filtering through a plug of celite in a Pasteur pipette, directly into the NMR tube. The NMR tube is then usually sealed with a polyethylene cap, but can be flame sealed or sealed with a Teflon 'Schlenk' tap or even a very small rubber septum. Parafilm may be wrapped around the cap to reduce solvent evaporation. Shigemi tubes A Shigemi tube is a microscale NMR tube used with an ordinary-size NMR tube. Shigemi tubes may be appropriate for protein NMR experiments, where only a smaller sample is available. A corresponding smaller solvent volume is desired to maintain a higher sample concentration. The reduced sample depth is compensated for by solid glass on the NMR tube beneath the level of sample, which varies for the make of spectrometer. Once air bubbles have been expelled, the plunger is secured to the tube proper by parafilm. Ideally, the tubes are matched with the deuterated solvent used to have better spectrum resolution. Image:Shigemi tubes disassembled.JPGPlunger/insert centre, left 8 mm \\"bottom length\\" outer tube suitable for Bruker and Varian NMR spectrometers, right 15 mm outer tube suitable for Varian only Image:Shigemi tube assembled.JPGFully assembled 8 mm Shigemi tube, insert secured to outer tube with parafilm Image:Shigemi sample close-up.JPGClose-up of the sample lying in between insert and \\"bottom length\\" Cleaning Aqua regia has been added to these NMR tubes to remove all traces of organic material. NMR tube cleaning apparatus: 1: NMR tube, 2: Compound residue, 3, 4: NMR tube cap, able to form a vacuum seal, 5: Cleaning Tube fits within NMR tube, 6: Solvent reservoir container, 7: Solvent/solvent level, 8: Vacuum applied, 9: Waste solvent. NMR tubes are hard to clean because of their small bore. They are cleaned best before the sample has dried. Cleaning is performed usually by rinsing with the same (non-deuterated) solvent used to dissolve the initial sample. Dichloromethane or acetone are good choices because dichloromethane is similar in polarity to chloroform, a common NMR solvent, while acetone dissolves many organic compounds. Sonication and scrubbing with a pipe cleaner may be helpful in removing traces of solid contaminants. If necessary, the tube may be filled with an oxidizing solution of aqua regia or piranha solution (H2O2/H2SO4). Care should be taken with these solutions, as they can unexpectedly and violently erupt from the NMR tube due to pressure build-up (aque regia) or explosion (piranha). Chromic acid solutions are never used, due to traces of paramagnetic chromium left behind on the tubes causing interference with NMR experiments. When the NMR tube is determined to be clean, it is triple-rinsed with distilled water, acetone, and left to air-dry or dry in an oven at high-temperature. It is best not to exceed 60 ¬∞C. At higher temperatures, slight tube distortion can occur which will affect tube camber. If NMR tubes are washed, a final rinse is recommended with a solvent that easily evaporates at 60 ¬∞C and that has no residue. =NMR tube cleaner= A better alternative to the use of potentially hazardous oxidizers is an NMR tube cleaner (right). It is an apparatus which uses a vacuum to flush solvent and/or a detergent solution through the entire length of the NMR tube. In this apparatus, the NMR tube 1 (with the cap 3 fixed to the base of the NMR tube), is placed upside down on the apparatus. The NMR tube fits over an inner tube 5 linked to the solvent reservoir 6. The NMR cap rests on the outer tube of the apparatus 4. A vacuum is applied (usually via a water aspirator via the vacuum inlet). The NMR tube cap forms a vacuum seal. Solvent 7 is drawn from the solvent reservoir 6 and is forced to the base of the NMR tube and flushes the NMR tube out 9 with solvent cleaning it. Note to complete the vacuum a flask is attached to the NMR tube cleaning apparatus. This sort of apparatus is commercially available, though it is costly and easy to destroy by shattering or breaking off the cleaning tube. Equivalent designs may be assembled from ordinary labware as well. Gallery Image:Polythiophenes fluorescence NMR tube.jpgA sample of polythiophenes in an NMR tube.

It was one of the first disturbances which preceded the French Revolution, and is credited by a few historians as its start. Background Grenoble was the scene of popular unrest due to financial hardship from the economic crises. The causes of the French Revolution affected all of France, but matters came to a head first in Grenoble. Unrest in the parliamentary town was sparked by the attempts of Cardinal √âtienne Charles de Lom√©nie de Brienne, the Archbishop of Toulouse and Controller-General of Louis XVI, to abolish the Parlements to work around their refusal to enact a new tax to deal with France's unmanageable public debt. Tensions that had been rising in urban populations, due to poor harvests and the high cost of bread, were exacerbated by the refusal of the privileged classes ‚Äî the Church, and the aristocracy, who insisted on retaining the right to collect feudal and seignorial royalties from their peasants and landholders ‚Äî to relinquish any of their fiscal privileges. This blocked the reforms of the king's minister Charles Alexandre de Calonne and the Assembly of Notables of January 1787. Added to this, Brienne, appointed as the king's Controller- General of Finance on 8 April 1787, was widely regarded as being a manager without experience or imagination.La ¬´Journ√©e des tuiles¬ª √† Grenoble, Herodote.net, Retrieved on 4 November 2006 Shortly before 7 June 1788, in a large meeting at Grenoble those who attended the meeting decided to call together the old Estates of the province of Dauphin√©. The government responded by sending troops to the area to put down the movement. Riots At roughly 10 in the morning of Saturday, 7 June, merchants closed down their shops as groups of 300 to 400 men and women formed, armed with stones, sticks, axes, bars. They rushed to the city gates to prevent the departure of judges who took part in the Grenoble meeting. Some rioters attempted to cross the Is√®re but faced a picket of 50 soldiers at the St. Lawrence bridge, while others headed to the Rue Neuve. Map of Grenoble in 1788: The six red dots show the riots in the city. The black squares show the dwellings of the parliamentarians. The cathedral's bells were seized by French peasants at noon. The crowd swiftly grew, as the bells provoked the influx of neighbouring peasants to creep in the city, climbing the walls, using boats on the Isere and for some, pushing open the city gates. Other insurgents boarded the ramparts and rushed to the hotel (L'h√¥tel de la Premi√®re pr√©sidence) the Duke of Clermont-Tonnerre was staying in at the time. The Duke had two elite regiments in Grenoble,Jean Sgard, Les trente r√©cits de la Journ√©e des Tuiles. the Regiment of the Royal Navy (R√©giment Royal-La-Marine) whose colonel was Marquis d'Ambert and the regiment of Austrasia (R√©giment d'Austrasie) which was commanded by Colonel Count Chabord. The Royal Navy was the first to respond to the growing crowds and was given the order to quell the rioting without the use of arms. However, as the mob stormed the hotel entrance, the situation escalated. Soldiers sent to quell the disturbances forced the townspeople off the streets. Some sources say that the soldiers were sent to disperse parliamentarians who were attempting to assemble a parliament. During an attack, Royal Navy soldiers injured a 75-year-old man with a bayonet. At the sight of blood, the people became angry and started to tear up the streets. Townspeople climbed onto the roofs of buildings around the Jesuit CollegeToday the Lyc√©e Stendhal in rue Raoul Blanchard to hurl down a rain of roof-tiles on the soldiers in the streets below, hence the episode's name. Many soldiers took refuge in a building to shoot through the windows, while the crowd continued to rush inside and ravage everything. A noncommissioned officer of the Royal Navy, commanding a patrol of four soldiers, gave the order to open fire into the mob. One civilian was killed and a boy of 12 wounded.Claude Muller, Heurs et malheurs du Dauphin√©, pp. 112‚Äì114. To the east of the city, the Royal Navy soldiers were forced to open fire in order to protect the city's arsenal, fearing that the rioters would seize the weapons and ammunition. Meanwhile, Colonel Count Chabord began deploying the regiment of Austrasia to aid and relieve the Royal Navy soldiers. Three of the city's four consuls gathered at the City Hall and attempted to reason with the crowd. However, their words were silenced amidst the clamour of the mob. Through great difficulty, the consuls made their way through the crowds and eventually took refuge with the officers of the local garrison. Later that evening, the Duke of Clermont-Tonnerre withdrew his troops from the streets and hotel to prevent further violence from escalating the situation. The Duke managed to narrowly escape the hotel before the crowd completely looted the inside. With control of the hotel lost, the Royal Navy troops were ordered to return to their quarters. At six, a crowd estimated at ten thousand people shouting \\"Long live the parliament\\" forced the judges to return to the Palace of the Parliament of Dauphin√© (Palais du Parlement du Dauphin√©) by flooding them with flowers.Paul Dreyfus, Histoire du Dauphin√© , p. 191. Throughout the night, carillons sounded triumphantly, a large bonfire crackled on Saint-Andr√© square surrounded by a crowd that danced and sang \\"Long live forever our parliament! May God preserve the King and the devil take Brienne and Lamoignon.\\" On 10 June, the local commander attempted to appease the spirits of the crowd, with no success. Under the orders of exile pronounced against them by the King, the parliamentarians were forced to flee from Grenoble in the morning of 12 June. It wasn't until the 14th of July that order was fully restored in the city by Marshal Vaux, who replaced the Duke of Clermont-Tonnerre.Eug√®ne Chaper, La Journ√©e des Tuiles √† Grenoble (7 juin 1788) : Documents contemporains en grande partie in√©dits recueillis et publi√©s par un vieux bibliophile Dauphinois. The commander of the troops found the situation so alarming that he agreed to allow the meeting of the Estates to proceed, but not in the capital. A meeting was therefore arranged for the 21 July 1788 at the nearby village of Vizille. This meeting became known as the Assembly of Vizille. In all, six outbreaks of rioting have been identified in the city on 7 June. The event was commemorated by Alexandre Debelle's The Day of the Tiles, 13 July 1788, painted in 1889.The Day of the Tiles, 13 July 1788 He painted it a century after the event and got the date wrong, but it undoubtedly attempts to depict the events described by the title. Later events The meeting of the three Estates which had been agreed to took place at Vizille on 21 July. Several hundred people assembled, representing the three Estates, the nobility, the clergy and the middle class (the bourgeoisie), who were granted double representation. The meeting was led by a moderate reformist lawyer, Jean Joseph Mounier, and passed resolutions: *convoking the States-General of France; *pledging the province to refuse to pay all taxes not voted by the Estates-General; and *calling for the abolition of arbitrary imprisonment on the King's order by the warrant known as the lettre de cachet. These demands were accepted by the King. Brienne left office during August 1788, but before doing so issued a decree convoking the Estates-General for 1 May 1789. It is not clear whether this decree was prompted by the demands from the Assembly of Vizille or the Day of the Tiles, because at least one source puts the date of the decree at 7 July 1788 after the Day of the Tiles, but two weeks before the Assembly of Vizille.From Failed Reforms to Revolutionary Crisis,A Short History of the French Revolution, Jeremy D. Popkin, Prentice-Hall, 14 July 2005, Retrieved on 3 November 2006 Since 1984, the Ch√¢teau de Vizille houses the Mus√©e de la R√©volution fran√ßaise. Significance Some historians, such as Jonathan Sperber, have used the Day of the Tiles to demonstrate the worsening situation in France in the buildup to the French Revolution of 1789. Others have even credited it with being the beginning of the revolution itself. The events as related by R. M. Johnston provide an apparently clear link between the Day of the Tiles, the Assembly of Vizille and the start of the revolution proper. Notes Further reading * Simon Schama (1989).

Born in Altoona, Pennsylvania, Irwin attended the University of North Carolina, where he played on the school's baseball team. After graduating from college, he signed with the Cleveland Indians, and began playing professionally with the New Orleans Pelicans of the Southern Association. He won the starting shortstop job to begin the 1936 season despite not having any professional baseball experience beforehand. Irwin played in 151 games for the Pelicans both in 1937 and 1938, and finished his second season with a .322 batting average. Entering the 1938 Cleveland Indians season, Irwin was invited to spring training, and was noted as someone who could win the starting second baseman job. He did not win the job, and was optioned to the Milwaukee Brewers. He played in 125 games on the season, where he had a .296 batting average. At the end of the season, he was promoted to the major league club. He played in the final three games of the season as the team's starting shortstop, and had one hit in nine at-bats. On December 15, 1938, he was traded to the Boston Red Sox with Denny Galehouse for Ben Chapman. As the Red Sox had Hall of Famer Joe Cronin at the shortstop position, the plan was to keep Irwin in Louisville for a season and go from there. He played in 53 games for the Louisville Colonels, then spent part of 1939 and all of 1940 with the Little Rock Travelers, where he had a .256 batting average in 137 games in 1940. After taking the 1941 season off, he spent part of 1942 with Little Rock.

The Army Technical Bureau had been working on the Type 4 Chi-To as the counter to the M4 Sherman, but there were problems and delays in the program. As a result a stopgap tank was required. The Type 3 Chi-Nu medium tank was developed to cope with the M4 Sherman.Taki's Imperial Japanese Army: \\"Tanks after Chi-Ha\\" Finally, the first prototype Type 4 Chi-To was delivered in 1944. Similar in appearance but significantly larger than the Type 97, it was the most advanced Japanese tank to reach the production stage. Intended Type 4 Chi-To output was 25 tanks per month; with 20 to be made at Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and 5 to be produced at Kobe Seiko-sho. Late war shortage-induced delays caused by the severing of supply lines with conquered territories and U.S. strategic bombing of the Japanese mainland resulted in a total of six chassis being built. According to \\"The National Institute for Defense Studies, Ministry of Defense, Military Administration of Munitions Mobilization, Production Chart of January to April of 1945\\", the plan was to produce a total of 6 Type 4 Chi-To tanks in the first three months of 1945.\\"The National Institute for Defense Studies, Ministry of Defense, Military Administration of Munitions Mobilization, Production Chart of January to April of 1945\\" Two Type 4 Chi-To tanks are known to have been completed in 1945 and neither saw combat.Taki's Imperial Japanese Army: Type 4 Medium Tank \\"Chi-To\\" At the end of World War II, two completed Type 4 Chi-To tanks were dumped into Lake Hamana in Shizuoka Prefecture to avoid capture by Allied occupation forces.

Mercier fled France for the United States during the Nazi invasion, eventually settling in New York City. After meeting Edward M. Greer in 1940, the two founded Greer Hydraulics (in 1942) to produce aircraft hydraulic components. In 1943, Jean Mercier recognized an opportunity for his bladder type accumulators in Hamilton Standard's hydromatic propellers. They needed a device that would fit inside the dome of their propeller, and have the ability to store sufficient hydraulic fluid to \\"feather\\" the propeller on an engine failure that might be experienced in combat. It also had to be able to function at temperatures from ‚àí40 ¬∞F to +180 ¬∞F. There was a single insurmountable problem‚Äîweight, which was a problem since World War II aircraft were quite small. The use of a gas/oil separator, today called a bladder, solved the problem. Greer and Mercier formed a patent company (Greer-Olaer) and Greer Hydraulics became the sole licensee, with the rights to continue development and to license other companies outside the U.S. From the early 1950s, bladder-type accumulators became the unit that was specified and used in almost every application where hydraulics was employed - machine tools, plastic machinery, circuit breakers, rock crushers, oil drilling, farm and road machinery, to name a few. Greer Hydraulics was later acquired by Parker-Hannifin of Cleveland, Ohio. Mercier was awarded the Franklin Institute's Certificate of Merit in 1951.

Origin  The ship, along with her three sister ships , and , had originally been ordered by Argentina from the English shipyard Cammell Laird in Birkenhead. Panthir was originally named Santiago del Estero. They were purchased in 1912 by Greece, ready for delivery, each for the sum of ¬£148,000, when the Balkan Wars seemed likely. Accepted by Captain Ath. Miaoulis, RHN in Palermo, Sicily, where she arrived manned by a foreign crew.  Service history  During the Balkan Wars, the Royal Hellenic Navy purchased only the minimum amount of ammunition, 3,000 rounds of torpedoes. Torpedoes were not available for this class of ship, and for this reason these ships were initially named 'scouts' rather than 'destroyers'. During World War I, Greece belatedly entered the war on the side of the Triple Entente and, due to Greece's neutrality the four Aetos-class ships were seized by the Allies in October 1916, taken over by the French in November, and served in the French Navy from 1917-18. By 1918, they were back on escort duty under Greek colors, mainly in the Aegean Sea. In 1919-1920, she participated in the operations in Southern Russia evacuating Greek refugees from the Russian Civil War with the battleships and and the destroyer Leon, remaining for 263 days in the Black Sea. During the Asia Minor war, she took part in the blockade of the Asia Minor coasts. After the war, Panthir was refurbished from 1925‚Äì1927. She also participated in the Second World War, after surviving the German invasion of April, 1941, Panthir was based in the Indian Ocean. Between May and October, 1942, her armament was updated in Bombay enabling her to offer better anti- aircraft protection and anti-surface capabilities on her new missions.

Both its scientific and alternative common name honours the mammalogist Philip \\"Don Felipe\\" Hershkovitz. It appears to be largely restricted to riparian habitats at an altitude of . There is extensive deforestation within its limited distribution within the northern Andes of Colombia and Ecuador, and with less than 10 known specimens, it is probably the rarest carnivoran in South America.Novak, R. M. 1999. Walker's Mammals of the World. 6th edition. Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore. It is considered vulnerable by the IUCN. It is the second-smallest living carnivore on average, being only slightly larger than the least weasel (Mustela nivalis) and slightly smaller than the stoat or ermine (M. erminea).Carnivores of the World by Dr. Luke Hunter. Princeton University Press (2011), The upperparts and tail are blackish-brown, while the underparts are orange-buff. The species was formerly only known from specimens until the first photo of a living individual was taken in 2011 by an amateur naturalist who found one trapped in his parents' house; the weasel subsequently escaped to the outdoors. The image was uploaded to iNaturalist in 2018, where it gained widespread attention. Description M. felipei has an elongated body with an average length of , and a tail long. Weight ranges between . M. felipei has a dark dorsal color with no variation, ventrally the weasel has a light orange color with gradual fading of color up to the head. Hair color from the tail to the nose is uniform with no striping or spotting. M. felipei has an inflated auditory bulla located near the dorsal midline on the body, along with a wide mesopterygoid fossa. The soles of the feet lack any fur, and extensive webbing is located on the second, third, and fourth digits, suggesting a semi-aquatic lifestyle. Distribution and habitat M. felipei is one of the least studied carnivore species in the Americas. Photos taken of a Colombian weasel by Juan de Roux are the first known photos of a living Colombian weasel. These tiny carnivores are thought to maintain a larger geographical range that currently known. Reports of sightings have placed M. felipei in the mountain ranges of western Colombia to northern Ecuador. M. felipei was originally thought to be endemic to Colombia however recent specimens have been collected in Ecuador that have since proven this thought wrong. Distribution and habitat modeling surveys have been able to predict that M. felipei is distributed between 20 protected areas in Colombia, and 14 in Ecuador along with three previously known locations in both countries, the majority of these locations lie in protected areas of the forest. From geographic modeling, and collected specimens it has been concluded that Mustela felipei lives in largely riparian habitats, primarily staying close to rivers, streams, and along the shorelines of other natural water sources. Since this habitat lies in an elevation range of it is classified as being in a \\"cloud forest\\" consisting of 100% humidity adding to the riparian habitat. Diet M. felipei is a carnivorous mammal that preys primarily on fish, other small aquatic animals, and small terrestrial mammals. Hunting is aided by the use of webbed feet and camouflaged fur. Conservation status Mustela felipei has been recognized by the IUCN as being vulnerable and having a decreasing population. However, due to rarity of sighting, and deforestation of known habitat it remains unclear as to the true numbers of individuals that make up the population. References =Bibliography= * Izor, R.

According to Egyptologists Kim Ryholt and Darrell Baker, he was the 5th king of the dynasty, reigning for 2 years over most of Egypt, except perhaps the eastern Nile Delta, from 1793 BC until 1791 BC. Family The Egyptologist Kim Ryholt notes that Ameny Qemau's name is essentially a filiative nomen, that is, a name specifying the filiation of its holder. Indeed, Ameny Qemau could be read as \\"Ameny['s son] Qemau\\". Ryholt concludes that the Ameny in question was Qemau's predecessor Sekhemkare Amenemhat V and that Qemau was his son.K.S.B. Ryholt: The Political Situation in Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period, c.1800-1550 BC, Carsten Niebuhr Institute Publications, vol. 20. Copenhagen: Museum Tusculanum Press, 1997 This opinion is shared by Egyptologist Darrell Baker but not by J√ºrgen von Beckerath, who left Ameny Qemau's position within the 13th Dynasty undetermined in his handbook of Egyptian pharaohs.J√ºrgen von Beckerath: Hanbuch der agyptische Konigsnamen, Muncher. Agyptologische Studien 49, Mainz, (1999), p. 102-103 The successor of Ameny Qemau, Qemau Siharnedjheritef may have been his son as \\"Qemau Siharnedjheritef\\" may be read \\"The son of Qemau, Horus protects his father\\". Attestations Beyond his pyramid in Dahshur, Ameny Qemau is a poorly attested king: his name does not appear on the Turin canon and the only contemporary attestations of him are fragments of four inscribed canopic jars found in the pyramid. An additional plaquette of unknown provenance bears his name but may be a modern forgery. Ameny Qemau's identity is therefore uncertain and attempts have been made to identify him with better attested kings of the period, in particular with Sehotepibre, who appears on the Turin canon after Amenemhat V.J√ºrgen von Beckerath: Untersuchungen zur politischen Geschichte der zweiten Zwischenzeit in √Ñgypten. Gl√ºckstadt/ New York 1964, p. 41-42, 233, XIII. B Ryholt however believes that Qemau's name was lost in a wsf lacuna of the Turin canon located just before Amenemhat V. A wsf (literally \\"missing\\") lacuna denotes a lacuna in the original document from which the canon was copied in Ramesside times.  Pyramid  Ameny Qemau had a pyramid built for himself in the south of Dahshur. The pyramid was discovered in 1957 by Charles Mus√®s and only investigated in 1968. It originally measured 50 square meters at its base and stood 35 meters high but is now completely ruined due to stone robbing. The substructures have also been extensively damaged. The burial chamber of the king was made of a single large block of quartzite, similar to those found in the pyramid of Amenemhat III at Hawara and the Mazghuna pyramids.Miroslav Verner: The Pyramids - Their Archaeology and History, Atlantic Books, 2001, Mark Lehner: The Complete Pyramids, London: Thames and Hudson (1997) p.185 . The block was hewn to receive the sarcophagus and canopic jars of the king but only fragments of these and unidentified bones where found onsite.Nabil M. Swelim, Aidan Dodson: On the Pyramid of Ameny-Qemau and its Canopic Equipment, In: Mitteilungen des Deutschen Arch√§ologischen Instituts, Abteilung Kairo 54 (1998), p. 319 - 334 Additionally, the name of Ameny Qemau is believed to appear on an inscribed block which was found in a newly-discovered pyramid at Dahshur whose existence was announced in April 2017. Many Egyptologists such as James P. Allen, Aidan Dodson and Thomas Schneider agrees that the royal name on the block is that of Ameny Qemau. Dodson further speculated that, given the relatively poor quality of the inscription and the oddity for a pharaoh to be the owner of two pyramids, the newly-discovered one may have originally belonged to one of Qemau's predecessors, and that he may have usurped the structure by chiseling out the royal names on the block and superimposing his own cartouches on it. Among the artifacts found in the burial chamber were a sarcophagus, canopic jars, and boxes of wrappings. Inscriptions on the boxes mention one of the daughters of Ameny Qemau, Hatshepsut, suggesting that the pyramid may have been usurped for his daughter and may explain why he has two pyramids.

The park is located on Pennsylvania Route 144, north of Renovo and south of Galeton. Ole Bull State Park is in the Kettle Creek Valley, and is surrounded by Susquehannock State Forest. The woods surrounding the park are called the Black Forest because of its once dense tree cover. History =New Norway= Ole Bull Ole Bull State Park is named for Ole Borneman Bull. Ole Bull was a famous Norwegian violinist. He visited the United States several times and played with great success. While visiting the United States, Bull became interested in founding a colony for his fellow countrymen. In 1852, he purchased of land for $10,000 in Pennsylvania and founded the colony, which was called New Norway. He established four communities, New Bergen (now known as Carter Camp), Oleona, New Norway, and Valhalla in the Kettle Creek area. Ole Bull began work on a \\"castle\\", which he named Nordjenskald. The castle and the communities were abandoned in less than a year. The problems encountered by the Norwegian pioneers were mainly based on the inexperience of the farmers in dealing with clearing the land of its many trees. Efforts to settle the area were parodied in the 1853 Norwegian folk song Oleanna, which was translated into English and popularized by Pete Seeger in 1955. The Norwegians, however, did not give up. They migrated west into Minnesota and the Dakotas. The settlement may have failed, but Ole Bull was not forgotten. The citizens of Norway paid for the construction of a monument to honor Ole Bull. The statue was placed in the park on the 150th anniversary of New Norway in 2002. =Lumber Era= The Kettle Creek area was part of the massive lumbering operation that occurred in most of north central Pennsylvania in the 1880s and 1890s. The lumbering industry harvested the old-growth white pine and hemlock. Two railroads were built on the banks of Kettle Creek to haul the timber to sawmills in the Cross Fork area. The old-growth forest was soon gone. The land was no longer useful to the lumber industry and it fell into disuse. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania purchased much of the land and Ole Bull State Park was opened in 1925. =Civilian Conservation Corps= Many of the facilities at Ole Bull State Park were constructed during the Great Depression by the Civilian Conservation Corps founded by American President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The CCC created many jobs for the out of work industrial workers from throughout the United States. Ole Bull State Park is home to many examples of the work of the Civilian Conservation Corps throughout North Central Pennsylvania. They built outhouses, pavilions, and the camping areas. The CCC also built the original dam in the swimming area. Recreation =Hunting and fishing= Hunting is permitted on of Ole Bull State Park. Hunters are expected to follow the rules and regulations of the Pennsylvania State Game Commission. The common game species are ruffed grouse, squirrels, turkey, white-tailed deer, and black bears. Many more acres of forested woodlands are available for hunting on the grounds of the adjacent Susquehannock State Forest. The water quality of Kettle Creek and Ole Bull Run is very good. The waters offer fishing for brook, rainbow and brown trout. There is a special fishing area of children and people with disabilities near the dam on Kettle Creek. Fishing is prohibited between the wires at the dam basin and in the swimming area. =Swimming and camping= Camping at the park Swimming is permitted at the sandy beach on Kettle Creek during the months of May through mid-September. Swim at your own risk. Lifeguards are not provided. Pets are not permitted at the beach. Camping is permitted year round at Ole Bull State Park. There are two camping areas on the banks of Kettle Creek. Some of the sites are sunny and some are shaded. There are 24 electric hookups at one campsite and 21 at the other. All campsites have a level gravel pad for setting up campers. They also feature a fire ring and a picnic table. Modern restrooms, water hydrants and a sanitary dump station are available at Ole Bull State Park. =Picnics and trails= The picnic area is on the bank of Kettle Creek across from the swimming area. There are four pavilions, many picnic tables, a playground, fireplaces, a restroom and water hydrants. There is electricity at the Stone Pavilion. These pavilion must be reserved in order to have access to the electricity. Ole Bull State Park is a trailhead for the Susquehannock Trail System. It also of self-contained trails. The Daugherty Loop Trail uses old logging roads and a railroad grade to pass through the Black Forest of Pennsylvania. The Beaver Dam Nature Trail follows Kettle Creek for . The Ole Bull Trail leads to the remains of Ole Bull's \\"castle\\", Nordjenskald. This area is the site of a panoramic view of the park. In the winter months cross country skiing, snow shoes and snow mobiles are permitted.

As a probability theorist and statistician, Gill is most well known for his research on counting processes and survival analysis, some of which has appeared in an advanced textbook. Now retired, he was the chair of mathematical statistics at Leiden University. Gill is also known for his pro bono consulting and advocacy on behalf of victims of incompetent statistical testimony, including a Dutch nurse who was wrongfully convicted and jailed for six years. Biography He studied mathematics at the University of Cambridge (1970‚Äì1973), and subsequently followed the Diploma of Statistics course there (1973‚Äì1974). Marrying a Dutch woman, he moved to the Netherlands where he worked from 1974 to 1988 at the Mathematical Centre (later renamed Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica, or CWI) of Amsterdam. In 1979, Gill obtained his PhD with the thesis Censoring and Stochastic Integrals, which was supervised by Jacobus Oosterhoff of the Vrije Universiteit, which awarded the doctorate. Gill spent Autumn 1980 at the Statistical Research Unit at the University of Copenhagen. Gill continued to collaborate with Danish (and Norwegian) statisticians for ten years, helping to write the book Statistical models based on counting processes, which is often referred to as \\"ABGK\\" (for the authors Andersen, Borgan, Gill, and Keiding). In 1983 he became the head of the Department of Mathematical Statistics at CWI. In 1988 he moved to the Department of Mathematics of Utrecht University. Gill became the chair in mathematical stochastics‚Äîthis chair represented the three mathematical sciences of mathematical statistics, probability theory, and operations research. His PhD students include Sara van de Geer and Mark van der Laan. In 2006, he moved to the Department of Mathematics at Leiden University, where he became the chair of mathematical statistics. Since then, he has conducted statistical research in the theory of quantum information, forensic statistics, scientific integrity and in biostatistics. He has also worked on survival analysis, semiparametric models, causality, missing data, machine learning, and statistics in image analysis. Gill also publishes on the foundations of several mathematical sciences: the foundations of statistics, of probability, of mathematics, and of quantum physics. He reached the mandatory retirement age in 2017, and continues with research and consultancy. Statistical advocacy against wrongful convictions In recent years he has lobbied for retrials for Lucia de Berk, Kevin Sweeney and Benjamin Geen. The nurse Lucia de Berk was sentenced to life imprisonment, after a legal psychologist gave testimony that there was great likelihood that de Berk committed a string of murders. > The court was told by Dr Henk Elffers of the Netherlands Institute for the > Study of Crime and Law Enforcement that more children had died on her shifts > than appeared possible by chance. He put the odds of her presence being a > mere coincidence at one in 342 million, a figure that seemed to have blinded > the court to any alternative explanation of the deaths. This statistical testimony was shown to be fallacious by professional statisticians, notably Gill. Continued scrutiny showed that the data had also been collected to support the prosecutor's conviction of Berk, which further invalidated the pseudo-statistical testimony.Persbericht CWI Petitie 2 November 2007\\"Expert on the most important proof in the Lucia de B. case: 'This baby has not been poisoned'\\".

Waconda Spring, or Great Spirit Spring, was a natural artesian spring located in Mitchell County, near the towns of Glen Elder and Cawker City in the U.S. state of Kansas. It was a sacred site for Native American tribes of the Great Plains and, for a time, became the site of a health spa for American settlers. With the completion of the Glen Elder Dam in 1968, the mineral spring disappeared beneath the waters of Waconda Reservoir. Description Waconda Spring was situated on the bank of the Solomon River, below the North and South Forks of the river. The water flowing from the spring had deposited a large cone of travertine around it.Buchanan, Rex, Robert Sawin, and Wayne Lebsack (2000). \\"Water of the Most Excellent Kind: Historic Springs in Kansas\\".

These animals, the nahurac, act as Tirawa's servants and messengers, and intercede for the Pawnee with Tirawa. The nahurac had five lodges, of which Waconda Spring was one. The foremost among them was Pahuk, usually translated \\"hill island\\", a bluff on the south side of the Platte River, near the town of Cedar Bluffs in present-day Saunders County, Nebraska.Jensen, Richard E.

Beside the Pawnee, many other Native American tribes venerated Waconda Spring, often casting articles of value into it as offerings. George Bird Grinnell describes the offerings of the Pawnee as including blankets and robes, blue beads, eagle feathers, and moccasins. A geoglyph, produced by the intaglio technique of removing the surface sod to form a figure, is located on a hillside about two miles southwest of Waconda Spring. The figure represents an unidentified animal, possibly a beaver. It is thought to be several hundred years old; soil analysis indicates that it was renewed at least once after its initial excavation, suggesting that it was in use over an extended period of time.Blakeslee, Donald J.

Waconda Spring in history It is said that the first European explorer to visit Waconda Spring was Sir William Johnson in 1767; however, this is unlikely. The first recorded visit to the site was by General Zebulon Pike in 1806. Pike visited the spring during his exploration of the Great Plains after he had concluded a treaty with the Pawnee. Settlement in the area did not take place until after Kansas became a state in 1861. The first settler in the region was in 1870 by a man named Pfeiffer, who took out the first claim on the property. Kansas Senator Samuel C. Pomeroy toured the region in 1870 and marveled at what he saw. Said Pomeroy, \\"At first I declared it the Crater of an Ancient Volcano. The Water occupying its hollow center is fathomless, and about 200 feet in diameter in a perfect circle! It is always brimming full and running over on all sides ... The hills about it were as sacred to the Indians as those about Jerusalem.\\" Pomeroy recognized the site's commercial potential and went on to predict that a health resort would soon be built in the region.\\"Healing Waters: The Legend of Waconda Springs\\". Leisure and Sports Review. Retrieved 2010-09-18. Within a few years, a man named Burnham constructed a bottling works on the site and began selling the mineral water as a health tonic. He called it Waconda Flier. The sales of Waconda Flier piqued the interest of an eastern investor named McWilliams, who in 1884 invested in the site and began the construction of a stone sanitarium. The spring was fenced off and completely privatized. The building was completed ten years later, and under the management of G. W. Cooper, Waconda Spring became a hotel and health spa. Sales of Waconda Flier continued, and by the 1890s it was being sold in all parts of the country. In 1904, Waconda Flier won a medal for its superior medicinal qualities at the St. Louis World's Fair. In 1906, Dr. G. P. Abrahams purchased the property from McWilliams and continued operating the health spa and bottling plant until his 1924 death. In 1924, the property passed to Dr. Carl Bingesser, who had married Abrahams' daughter Anna in 1907. Under both Abrahams and Bingesser, the hotel resort was improved upon and maintained a solid reputation as health spa and place of healing. It continued to do so even as the spa passed on to Dr. Carlos Bingesser, the third generation of the Abrahams-Bingesser family to own and operate the spa. The facilities were fully modernized and offered physical therapy, hydro-therapy, electro-therapy, and dietary regimens. Water from Waconda Spring was used for internal and external cleansing of the body. It was piped into every bathtub in the sanitarium, was served with meals, and used for enemas. A popular slogan used to lure tourists to the resort was, \\"It will clean works until your works work.\\" Waconda Spring was a popular, profitable enterprise for the Bingesser family.\\"The History of Waconda\\". Glen Elder, Kansas. Retrieved 2010-09-18. Glen Elder Dam In 1944 the Bureau of Reclamation and the Army Corps of Engineers announced plans for a large earthen dam on the Solomon River near the town of Glen Elder. The plan called for the inundation of Waconda Spring. The Bingesser family fought to stop the plan, but in 1951 greater than normal rainfall in Kansas led to massive flooding in Topeka and other Kansas towns. This led to renewed calls for dams and other flood control projects, including renewed calls for the Glen Elder Dam. Dr. Bingesser brought in a respected hydrologist to inspect Waconda Spring. The hydrologist concluded that Waconda Spring was unique and possibly the only spring like it in the world. However, commercial advocates in favor of the dam dismissed the hydrologist and dismissively claimed that Waconda Spring was nothing more than a \\"mud hole.\\" In the end, the developers won. Construction on Glen Elder Dam began in 1964 and was completed by the end of 1968. Engineers bulldozed the hotel and health spa then, adding insult to injury, dumped the debris into the pool of Waconda Spring. Water from the Solomon River began filling up the valley, and by 1970 it was full. The irreplaceable Waconda Spring was lost beneath the waters of the reservoir that now bears its name.

Production history Some 20,133 of these 600 cc shaft-drive, opposed twin R60 (1956‚Äì1960, ), R60/2 (1960‚Äì1969, ), and R60US (1968‚Äì1969, 30 hp) were built. These models, except for those with the \\"US\\" designation, were designed primarily as rugged motorcycles to pull sidecars (mounting points were built in) and had duplex tubular steel frames. Simultaneously manufactured were related models, including the 500 cc R50 (1955‚Äì1960, ), the R50/2 (1960‚Äì1969, 26 hp), the R50 S (1960‚Äì1962, ), the R50US (1968‚Äì1969, 26 hp), and the 600 cc sport-oriented R69 (1955‚Äì1960, 35 hp), R69S (1960‚Äì1969, ), and R69US (1968‚Äì1969, 42 hp). In the United States, all these Earles-fork and US-fork (i.e., telescopic fork) models from 1955 to 1969 are often lumped together as \\"Slash-2\\" BMWs, even though that is technically incorrect. Not all of them, as seen above, have the \\"/2\\" designation. Perhaps the most famous BMW rider of the 1960s was Danny Liska, who took R60 models from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego in one trip, and from Europe's North Cape to South Africa's Cape of Good Hope in a second journey. His book about the first trip, Two Wheels to Adventure (Alaska to Argentina by Motorcycle), was published in 1989 with a second edition published in 2004. In the book \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\\", John and Sylvia accompany Robert Pirsig, the author, and his son Chris, on a 1968 road trip from Minnesota to San Francisco, riding a BMW R60. Throughout the book Pirsig contrasts his passion and care in taking care of his bike to John's fear of technology: \\"The BMW is famous for not giving mechanical problems on the road and that's what he is counting on.\\" Granada red 1967 BMW R60/2 1967 BMW R60/2 with 6¬Ω gallon tank and Craven Golden Arrow panniers Though BMW first used oil-damped telescopic front forks in the 1930s, it chose to use Earles forks on these models. The triangular front Earles fork, named after its designer, Englishman Ernest Earles, precluded any front-end dive during heavy front braking, which is common with telescopic front forks. It also worked well in sidecar duty. Though heavy and ponderous in turning, the Earles fork gave the old Beemer a steady and reassuring ride. Original 1968 photo of a brand-new BMW R60US with telescopic forks and standard dual saddle In 1968, BMW introduced telescopic forks on some of its slash-2 models, and they were continued into the 1969 model year. Modified, they became the front forks on the slash-5 models introduced for the 1970 model year. The photo of the red R60US to the right was taken at a BMW dealership in 1968 and shows a brand-new motorcycle waiting for its first buyer. Earles fork and telescopic fork models both were manufactured for these two years and were available to customers. During the 1960s, very few motorcycles were available with shaft final drive. BMW's were the most common. The driveshaft rode in an enclosed oil bath within the right swingarm, unlike BMW's previous models, and drove the rear wheel through an internally splined cup that meshes with a coupler crown gear keyed to the drive pinion. This meant that leaking seals could become a problem for the owners. Because the clutch was dry, there were seals at the rear of the crankshaft, at both ends of the transmission, at the rear of the driveshaft, and at the front and rear of the rear drive unit: many seals developed leaks. The front brakes were double leading shoes, and the rear had a single leading shoe. By modern standards, they were not good brakes. Tires, front and rear, were interchangeable in 3.50 inch by 18 inch size. Motorcycles sold in America had high handlebars with a cross brace. Those sold elsewhere came with low, Euro handlebars. A variety of saddle styles were available for these motorcycles. Those delivered in the U. S. typically were supplied with a single \\"dual\\" or bench saddle, either the standard size or a wide version that came with chrome rear-quarter passenger handles. Alternatives available included a Denfeld (not \\"Denfield\\") or Pagusa solo driver's saddle, or individual driver and passenger saddles. Accessories R60/2 with Avon full fairing and Craven top case The Madison (WI) BMW club in 1970, with many Wixom fairings Safety bar installed on a 1967 BMW R60/2 BMW motorcycles of the 1960s were noted as long-distance touring motorcycles. However, none came standard with fairings or luggage; these items were provided by aftermarket vendors. Fairings included the Wixom Ranger handlebar-mounted fairing made in Illinois, and Avon. There were numerous manufacturers of saddle bags and top cases for BMW twins in the 1960s including Wixom, British-made Craven, and leather saddlebags imported by Butler and Smith, who also offered several styles of luggage carriers for mounting behinds the passenger saddle. It also offered several styles of windshields, safety bars, a spotlight, metric tool kits, and a mechanical tachometer. U.S. motorcycles came standard with a narrow dual saddle, though wide dual saddles with chrome rear handles could be ordered. Solo saddles made by Pagusa or Denfeld for driver and passenger were also available. All motorcycles came with a tool kit. Hella turn signals were optional (photo below left), and were mounted at the ends of the handlebars showing light both forward and back.

It can occur as an overall difference between the two eyes, or as a difference in a particular meridian. If the ocular image size in both eyes are equal, the condition is known as iseikonia. Symptoms Up to 7% difference in image size is well tolerated. If magnification difference becomes excessive the effect can cause diplopia, suppression, disorientation, eyestrain, headache, and dizziness and balance disorders. Asthenopic symptoms alone may occur even if image size difference is less than 7%. Causes Retinal image size is determined by many factors. The size and position of the object being viewed affects the characteristics of the light entering the system. Corrective lenses affect these characteristics and are used commonly to correct refractive error. The optics of the eye including its refractive power and axial length also play a major role in retinal image size. Aniseikonia can occur naturally or be induced by the correction of a refractive error, usually anisometropia (having significantly different refractive errors between each eye) or antimetropia (being myopic (nearsighted) in one eye and hyperopic (farsighted) in the other.) Meridional aniseikonia occurs when these refractive differences only occur in one meridian (see astigmatism). One cause of significant anisometropia and subsequent aniseikonia has been aphakia. Aphakic patients do not have a crystalline lens. The crystalline lens is often removed because of opacities called cataracts. The absence of this lens left the patient highly hyperopic (farsighted) in that eye. For some patients the removal was only performed on one eye, resulting in the anisometropia / aniseikonia. Today, this is rarely a problem because when the lens is removed in cataract surgery, an intraocular lens, or IOL is left in its place. Retinal aniseikonia occur due to forward displacement, stretching or edema of retina. Diagnosis A way to demonstrate aniseikonia is to hold a near target (ex. pen or finger) approximately 6 inches directly in front of one eye. The person then closes one eye, and then the other. The person should notice that the target appears larger to the eye that it is directly in front of. When this object is viewed with both eyes, it is seen with a small amount of aniseikonia. The principles behind this demonstration are relative distance magnification (closer objects appear larger) and asymmetrical convergence (the target is not an equal distance from each eye). Treatment Optical aniseikonia due to anisometropia can be corrected by spectacles, contact lenses or refractive corneal surgeries. Spectacle correction is done by changing the optical magnification properties of the auxiliary optics (corrective lenses). The optical magnification properties of spectacle lenses can be adjusted by changing parameters like the base curve, vertex distance, and center thickness. Magnification size matched lenses that are used to correct aniseikonia are known as iseikonic lenses. Contact lenses may also provide less difference in retinal image size. Wider and better field of vision is another benefit of contact lens use. The difference in magnification can also be eliminated by a combination of contact lenses and glasses (creating a weak telescope system). The optimum design solution will depend on different parameters like cost, cosmetic implications, and if the patient can tolerate wearing a contact lens. For reducing aniseikonia, similar to contact lens correction, optical image size difference will be reduced in refractive surgeries also. Aniseikonia due to uniocular aphakia is best corrected surgically by intraocular lens implantation. Similarly retinal aniseikonia is corrected by treating causative retinal disease. Note however that before the optics can be designed, first the aniseikonia should be measured. When the image disparity is astigmatic (cylindrical) and not uniform, images can appear wider, taller, or diagonally different. When the disparity appears to vary across the visual field (field-dependent aniseikonia), as may be the case with an epiretinal membrane or retinal detachment, the aniseikonia cannot fully be corrected with traditional optical techniques like standard corrective lenses. However, partial correction often improves the patient's vision comfort significantly.

They are used in the laboratory and also to dispense small amounts of liquid medicines. A very common use was to dispense eye drops into the eye. The commonly recognized form is a glass tube tapered to a narrow point (a pipette) and fitted with a rubber bulb at the top, although many styles of both plastic and glass droppers exist. The combination of the pipette and rubber bulb has also been referred to as a teat pipette. The Pasteur pipette name is from the French scientist Louis Pasteur, who used a variant of them extensively during his research. In the past, there was no equipment to transfer a chemical solution without exposing it to the external environment. The hygiene and purity of chemical compounds is necessary for the expected result of each experiment. The eye dropper, both glass and plastic types, can be sterilized and plugged with a rubber bulb at the open end of the pipette preventing any contamination from the atmosphere. Generally, they are considered cheap enough to be disposable, however, so long as the glass point is not chipped, the eye dropper may be washed and reused indefinitely.  Overview  In laboratory use, droppers should not be used for work involving high accuracy since droppers are not designed to measure specific volume; however, it can be used to add drops of reagents. Each type of dropper is designed to produce a specific drop volume, but this is not highly precise. Before using a dropper, the tip should be carefully examined for cracks. To increase accuracy, the pipette is to be rinsed with the reagent. To use the dropper, squeeze the bulb to expel air out of the pipette and submerge the tip of the pipette to the solution vertically. Gently relax the bulb to draw the solution up and make sure that the solution does not overshoot into the bulb contaminating it. To dispense the reagent, hold the tip against the side of the target container at a 30 to 45 degrees angle. Broken pasteur pipettes should be disposed of in an appropriate glassware container.  Types  =Glass Pasteur pipette= Glass pasteur pipettes The two types of glass that are usually found in the laboratory and in the Pasteur pipette are borosilicate glass and soda lime glass. Borosilicate glass is a widely used glass for laboratory apparatus, as it can withstand chemicals and temperatures used in most laboratories. Borosilicate glass is also more economical since the glass can be fabricated easily compared to other types. Soda lime glass, although not as chemically resistant as Borosilicate glass, are suitable as a material for inexpensive apparatus such as the Pasteur pipette. =Plastic Pasteur pipette= Plastic pasteur pipettes Plastic Pasteur pipettes, also referred to as transfer pipettes, have their stems and bulbs in the form of a single piece made of soft plastic such as polyethelene. The bulb portion is thinner and therefore \\"squeezable\\", while the pipette portion is thick enough to be rigid. They commonly come in 1, 2, 3, and 5 ml which comes with a specific drop size of 10, 20, 25, 35, and 50 ¬µl. The volumes are usually marked on the stem, though the markings are rather crude and are not particularly accurate. A plastic dropper is relatively inexpensive and disposable, so they are often used to avoid cross-contamination. In a solution containing cell and/or protein, it reduces the loss of cell and/or protein that binds to glass. Some plastic pipettes include a long flexible tube that can be bent for drawing solution from small volume tubes. Plastic Pasteur pipettes are often used in biology where most media are aqueous and solvent resistance is not important. (Most organic solvents, such as hexane and acetone cannot be used in plastic Pasteur pipettes as the solvent can dissolve the plastic.) The pipettes are also hard to wash and are usually discarded with other biohazard waste after one use. Plastic bulb pipettes are generally not precise enough to be used for exact measurements, whereas their glass counterparts can be extremely precise. Other usages Column chromatography constructed using plastic pasteur pipette ; Microscale column chromatography The constriction toward the tip of the Pasteur pipettes may be plugged with a bit of tissue paper or cotton wool to filter off solids from small amounts of liquids. The bulb can be attached and squeezed to help viscous solutions filter more rapidly. With a bit of skill, Pasteur pipettes may also be used for microscale column chromatography. With appropriately fine silica gel, the bulb may be squeezed for microscale flash column chromatography.University of Colorado at Boulder, Procedure for Microscale Flash Column Chromatography. Accessed 1 Nov 2006. ; Microscale distillation Pasteur pipettes can also be used for microscale distillation. The liquid to be distilled is placed into a small reaction tube along with a boiling chip and heated to reflux one-half to two-thirds of the way up the inside of the tube. After squeezing the bulb to expel air, a pasteur pipette is inserted into the tube just below the level of the ring of refluxing liquid (into the vapor). The vapor is then drawn into the relatively cold pipette tip, causing it to condense and accumulate inside of the pipette. ; Microscale liquid storage Heat can be applied to the tip of a plastic Pasteur pipette to seal the solution and create a liquid-tight storage. Medical Laboratory Medical Laboratory required high efficiency and precision for drug test and observation of diseases. Pasteur pipettes are commonly used in the medical lab because of its essential accuracy. The design of the Pasteur pipette allows for high effective performance in the medical lab. It produces a constant volume of drop. This reduces the concern of liquid remaining in the pipette.

It was founded in Austin, Texas in August 1988 by Dr. Roger D. Ross, a leading computer scientist who headed Motorola's Advanced Microprocessor Division and directed the developments of Motorola's MC68030 and RISC-based 88000 microprocessor families. Dr. Ross was accompanied by Carl Dobbs, Janet Sooch, Steve Goldstein and Travor Smith, who were from Motorola's High-end Microprocessor Division, and were involved in the development of the 88000 microprocessor. He was later was joined by Am29000 engineer Raju Vegesna from AMD, who was originally hired by Dr. Ross at Motorola. Cypress Semiconductor provided initial funding. Original board members included Dr. Ross and well-known figures as Dr. T. J. Rodgers of Cypress Semiconductor, John Doerr of Kleiner Perkins Venture Capital, and L. J. Sevin of Sevin Rosen Venture Capital, who also served as Board Chairman. Ross eventually became a subsidiary of Cypress.  Lawsuits  In September 1988, the company was tied up in a lawsuit launched by Motorola. Motorola alleged that Ross and the other former Motorola staff had proprietary marketing material as well as all the 68000 and 88000 technical data, and sought a temporary injunction and $8 million in compensation and punitive damages. Motorola offered to settle the lawsuit without litigation if the former Motorola staff agreed not to work on modern computer architecture for 18 months. In late September 1988, Motorola withdrew the temporary injunction after former Motorola staff agreed not to compromise proprietary information regarding the 68000 and 88000 microprocessors. The lawsuit was settled in October.\\"Motorola Sues Defecting 88000 Designers, Cypress\\"\\"Motorola Withdraws Cypress-Ross Suit After 68050 Protection Assured\\" In mid-October, after the lawsuit from Motorola was settled, AMD launched a lawsuit over the hiring of Raju Vegesna, who was involved in the design of the Am29000. It was settled in late October, with AMD getting limited rights to inspect Ross' RISC-related designs.\\"Ross Technology Faces An Advanced Micro Devices\\"\\"AMD, Ross, Cypress Settle\\"  Early products  Ross' first products were SPARC chip sets. On 23 April 1990, Cypress announced the CY7C611 a microprocessor developed by Ross for embedded applications.Cypress Unveils SPARC Version For Embedded Applications Later, Ross was tasked by Cypress to develop the Pinnacle microprocessor, a superscalar SPARC implementation intended to compete with the Sun Microsystems and Texas Instruments SuperSPARC. In May 1993, Pinnacle was revealed to be the hyperSPARC, and the microprocessor was announced in May 1993.  After hyperSPARC  Cypress had bet the company's success on the hyperSPARC, threatening to abandon SPARC in favor of Digital Equipment Corporation's Alpha if Sun did not endorse the design. Although International Computers Limited and Meiko Scientific were claimed by Cypress to be major customers of hyperSPARC, the microprocessor was used in small quantities and by a handful of small vendors. Repeated delays in shipping the design, as a result of design and fabrication problems at Cypress contributed to the small number of users. As the hyperSPARC had failed to win major customers, Cypress sold Ross to Fujitsu for $23 million on 12 May 1993.\\"Cypress And Fujitsu Get Go-Ahead For Ross Sale\\" Fujitsu was interested in Ross for its hyperSPARC design, which it considered to be competitive. At the time, Fujitsu's SPARC business was limited to embedded designs after an unsuccessful attempt in the early 1990s to develop a high-end SPARC when the market for such designs was limited. After several government oversight committee hearings in Washington D.C., the sale was permitted to proceed. Under Fujitsu, the existing Board of Directors was replaced with its own members with the exception of Dr. Ross, who was named chairman. The company was taken public by Robertson, Stephens & Company on 7 November 1995, but Fujitsu kept a controlling interest in the company and continued to control the Board of Directors. Sun Microsystems also took a 10% interest in the company and was allowed to name a director as well. In February 1996, Ross Technology formed Ross Microcomputer in Sonoma, California to produce workstations and servers for value-added resellers (VARs) and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).\\"Ross Aims To Energize SPARC World With Entry Into Systems Business\\" Their first product, the hyperStation, was known since the division's creation and was introduced in June 1996. The systems used hyperSPARC microprocessors.\\"Ross Technology Launches First Hypersparc Systems\\" In 1995, Sun Microsystems introduced the 64-bit UltraSPARC microprocessor. As Sun was the dominant SPARC vendor, the majority of the market followed and began the migration to 64-bit SPARC. As a result, the 32-bit SPARC market began to decline. Ross did not have a 64-bit SPARC microprocessor and was at a disadvantage as a result. Combined with the creation of Ross Microcomputer earlier in the year, which incurred restructuring and other costs, they began to lose money. An effort to regain the company's competitiveness was active at the time, and it involved developing a new 64-bit microprocessor code-named Viper. Fujitsu provided the initial funding for the project, and also agreed to provide Ross Technology with a loan so it could continue operating. The company's stock fell during this period, and there were several warnings from NASDAQ in 1997 that the company would be delisted, which Ross avoided until 1998, when the company's stock fell below NASDAQ requirements. In April 1998, the company began to consider its financial options, including a search for a buyer. In May, the company warned that a closing of operations was coming and in June 1998, the board of directors decided to begin closing down the company after there were no buyers. A new business unit called BridgePoint was formed at this time to manage the existing inventory, to meet the requirements of existing customers and to provide support for Ross products. Ross Technology closed down in 1998 and all its assets and patents became the property of Fujitsu Ltd.\\"Ross Technology Sells More Assets Off To Fujitsu\\"  Legacy  Ross was a significant part of the hardware ecosystem of Sun's SPARC-based systems of the time. They participated in the design of the MBus architecture, and it was Ross Technology's 605-based Pinnacle product line that launched Sun servers into the 2x and 4x multi-processor arena which prior to Ross were confined to single processor server offerings. The hyperSPARC processor developed by Ross, viewed first as a competitor to Sun's own SPARC processor designs, but eventually adopted by Sun and sold both as upgrades and system components. It was an emergency engineering-wide Ross hyperSPARC upgrade which enabled Steve Jobs' Pixar to complete and deliver their animated movie Toy Story to Disney on schedule after the existing Sun Microsystems machines were overwhelmed in the late product development stage by Pixar's demanding new technology.

His family first moved to Louisiana and then to Columbus, Ohio. As the eldest child, he cared for his younger siblings. He moved to Florida after high school. Sancho resides in northeastern Leon County 2 miles west of Lake Miccosukee. Background Sancho received his A.A. degree from Valencia Community College in 1973. He then received his B.A. in Social Science from Stetson University in 1978. Sancho completed his education with a J.D. from Florida State University College of Law in 1987. In 1984 Sancho, a Democrat, was the Leon County leader for Presidential candidate Gary Hart. Sancho is a State Certified Supervisor of Elections and nationally certified by the Elections Center as a Certified Elections/Registration Administrator (CERA). He's a former staff member of the Florida House of Representatives, Corrections, Probation & Parole Committee. He is a member of the Center for Policy Alternatives, Voter Participation Advisory Board and member of The Elections Center. Supervisor of Elections After a bid for county commissioner in 1986, Sancho took courses in election machine management and became certified in their use. In November 1988, Sancho was elected to his first term as the Supervisor of Elections for Leon County, Florida. He was unopposed in each election since 1992. Sancho's tenure lasted 28 years, and retired after the 2016 election. National recognition In the 2000 presidential recount, Sancho (No Party Affiliation) was chosen to lead the Florida hand count of ballots in dispute in Miami-Dade County. The U.S. Supreme Court stopped the hand count in a 7-2 vote just as it got underway. Later the Court ruled 5‚Äì4 that no constitutionally valid recount could be completed by a December 12 \\"safe harbor\\" deadline. (Most voters (99%) in Leon County use the opti-scan equipment, but federal law requires one electronic machine per precinct for visually impaired voters). Hacking a Diebold machine In 2005, Sancho invited Bev Harris, founder of Black Box Voting, Kathleen Wynne, Black Box Voting Associate Director, Harri Hursti, computer programmer and security expert, Dr. Hugh Thompson, application security expert and Ph.D. in math, Susan Bernecker, former Republican candidate for New Orleans city council and Susan Pynchon, Director of Florida Fair Elections Coalition to Tallahassee. There, they performed what is now known as the Hursti Hack which became the center piece of an HBO documentary titled Hacking Democracy. =Results of Sancho's actions= As a result, Diebold, Election Systems & Software and Sequoia Voting Systems, the only 3 companies certified to do business in Florida would not sell Sancho voting machines. Automark was contacted by Sancho but the Secretary of State would not certify their voting equipment. ES&S; said, \\"did not believe it could have a smooth working relationship with Sancho\\". In Florida, Volusia County joined Leon County in dumping Diebold. Elections officials in the states of Maryland, North Carolina, Texas, and California have called into question the security and accuracy of new voting machines. Opposition After the test election, Secretary of State Sue Cobb (R) accused Sancho of \\"undermining voter confidence\\" and the Federal Government and demanded the return of a $564,000 in grant money given to Sancho through the state to purchase voting machines that would comply with ADA standards as mandated in the Help America Vote Act (HAVA), a United States federal law passed on October 29, 2002. At Leon County Commission meetings on February 14 and February 28, 2006 the only two Republicans in the local governments of either the city of Tallahassee or Leon County government, Tony Grippa and Ed Depuy of Leon County's seven-member county commission blasted Sancho for failing to provide Leon County with accessible voting machines in attacks that Sancho believes were politically motivated.Minutes of the Leon County Commission - February 14, 2006 At a Leon County Commission meeting on February 28, 2006, county staff revealed that Chuck Owen, Division Counsel for Diebold Election Systems, met with county staff behind closed doors on February 27. According to staff, Owen stated that Diebold would sell its touch-screen voting machines to the county if, and only if, the county removed Supervisor Sancho from office.Minutes of the Leon County Commission - February 28, 3006 That same day, Commissioner DePuy offered a motion, seconded by Commissioner Grippa to request the State Attorney to convene a grand jury to investigate why Leon County is not in compliance with the voting regulations.Minutes of the Leon County Commission, February 28, 2006 Tony Grippa left the Leon County Commission in April 2006. Ed DePuy was defeated in 2008 by Democrat Akin Akinyemi. Legal action On March 8, 2006 Sancho initiated legal proceedings against Diebold Election Systems for breach of contract. Attorney Lida Rodriguez Taseff with Duane Morris in Miami filed the suit. Diebold refused to return phone calls to Sancho and staff, refused to honor its existing contract with Leon County for the maintenance and upgrades of its voting system. Further, Diebold refused to sell Leon County touch-screen voting machines to meet state and federal requirements for disabled accessibility. In the media Sancho has been on National Public Radio and is familiar to readers of the New York Times, the Washington Post, St. Petersburg Times and appears in the 2006 HBO documentary Hacking Democracy.

Biography Born in Coxsackie, New York, Adams attended the public schools, studied law, was admitted to the bar about 1845, and commenced practice in New York City. He married Elizabeth Platt and they had three children, Sarah, Mary, and William. Career Adams moved to Cohoes in 1850 and in 1851 was appointed with rank of colonel to Governor Washington Hunt's staff in 1851. He was a Know Nothing member of the New York State Assembly (Albany County, 4th District) in 1858. Having engaged in the manufacture of knit underwear and in banking, Adams retired from the active world of commerce in 1870 and served as first Mayor of Cohoes, New York from 1870 to 1872. He was a delegate to the 1872 Republican National Convention in Philadelphia and a member of the New York State Senate (13th District) in 1872 and 1873. He was United States commissioner from New York to the Vienna Exposition in 1873. Adams was elected as a Republican to the forty-fourth Congress, holding office as U. S. Representative for New York's sixteenth district from March 4, 1875, to March 3, 1877.

When a voltage (electric field) is applied to the electrodes, positively charged conjugated and hydrated cations in the membrane molecular network are repulsed by the anode and migrate towards the negative electrode or the cathode carrying the hydrated water molecules with them. This migration creates an osmotic pressure gradient across the membrane causing the IPMC strip to bend or deform in a spectacular manner.Ionic Polymer Metal Composites (IPMCs) Set, Editor: Mohsen Shahinpoor, Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge 2016, https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/ebook/978-1-78262-720-3 On the other hand, mechanically bending or deforming the IPMC strips causes the conjugated cations to move around and this creates an electric potential and output voltage and transient current (energy harvesting, sensing modes) based on the Poisson-Nernst-Planck field theories. Hydrated water molecules are bonded with cations as they migrate around. However, if there are non-hydrated loose water molecules dragged with the hydrated cations as added mass towards the anode, once bending or deformation equilibrium is achieved the loose water molecules flow back towards the cathode and some back-relaxation may be observed. Ionic polymer‚Äìmetal composites (IPMCs) are synthetic composite nanomaterials that display artificial muscle behavior under an applied voltage or electric field. IPMCs are composed of an ionic polymer like Nafion or Flemion whose surfaces are chemically plated or physically coated with conductors such as platinum or gold. Under an applied voltage (1‚Äì5 V for typical 10mmx40mmx0.2mm samples), ion migration and redistribution due to the imposed voltage across a strip of IPMCs result in a bending deformation. If the plated electrodes are arranged in a non-symmetric configuration, the imposed voltage can induce all kinds of deformations such as twisting, rolling, torsioning, turning,twirling, whirling and non-symmetric bending deformation. Alternatively, if such deformations are physically applied to an IPMC strips they generate an output voltage signal (few millivolts for typical small samples) as sensors and energy harvesters. IPMCs are a type of electroactive polymer. They work very well in a liquid environment as well as in air. They have a force density of about 40 in a cantilever configuration, meaning that they can generate a tip force of almost 40 times their own weight in a cantilever mode. IPMCs in actuation,sensing and energy harvesting have a very broad bandwidth to kilo HZ and higher. IPMCs were first introduced in 1998 by Shahinpoor, Bar-Cohen, Xue, Simpson and Smith (see references below) but the original idea of ionic polymer actuators and sensors goes back to 1992-93 by Adolf, Shahinpoor, Segalman, Witkowski, Osada, Okuzaki, Hori, Doi, Matsumoto, Hirose, Oguro, Takenaka, Asaka and Kawami as depicted below: 1-Segalman D.

The newer HTTP/2 protocol uses the same idea and takes it further to allow multiple concurrent requests/responses to be multiplexed over a single connection.  Operation  = HTTP 1.0 = Under HTTP 1.0, connections are not considered persistent unless a keep-alive header is included, although there is no official specification for how keepalive operates. It was, in essence, added to an existing protocol. If the client supports keep-alive, it adds an additional header to the request: Connection: keep-alive Then, when the server receives this request and generates a response, it also adds a header to the response: Connection: keep-alive Following this, the connection is not dropped, but is instead kept open. When the client sends another request, it uses the same connection. This will continue until either the client or the server decides that the conversation is over, and one of them drops the connection. = HTTP 1.1 = In HTTP 1.1, all connections are considered persistent unless declared otherwise.Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and Routing, Persistence The HTTP persistent connections do not use separate keepalive messages, they just allow multiple requests to use a single connection. However, the default connection timeout of Apache httpd 1.3 and 2.0 is as little as 15 secondsApache HTTP Server 1.3 ‚Äì KeepAliveTimeout DirectiveApache HTTP Server 2.0 ‚Äì KeepAliveTimeout Directive and just 5 seconds for Apache httpd 2.2 and above.Apache HTTP Server 2.2 ‚Äì KeepAliveTimeout DirectiveApache HTTP Server 2.4 ‚Äì KeepAliveTimeout Directive The advantage of a short timeout is the ability to deliver multiple components of a web page quickly while not consuming resources to run multiple server processes or threads for too long.  Keepalive with chunked transfer encoding  Keepalive makes it difficult for the client to determine where one response ends and the next response begins, particularly during pipelined HTTP operation. This is a serious problem when \`Content-Length\` cannot be used due to streaming. To solve this problem, HTTP 1.1 introduced a chunked transfer coding that defines a \`last-chunk\` bit. The \`last-chunk\` bit is set at the end of each response so that the client knows where the next response begins.  Advantages  * Reduced latency in subsequent requests (no handshaking). * Reduced CPU usage and round-trips because of fewer new connections and TLS handshakes. * Enables HTTP pipelining of requests and responses. * Reduced network congestion (fewer TCP connections). * Errors can be reported without the penalty of closing the TCP connection. According to RFC 7230, section 6.4, \\"a client ought to limit the number of simultaneous open connections that it maintains to a given server\\". The previous version of the HTTP/1.1 specification stated specific maximum values but in the words of RFC 7230 \\"this was found to be impractical for many applications... instead... be conservative when opening multiple connections\\". These guidelines are intended to improve HTTP response times and avoid congestion. If HTTP pipelining is correctly implemented, there is no performance benefit to be gained from additional connections, while additional connections may cause issues with congestion.  Disadvantages  If the client does not close the connection when all of the data it needs has been received, the resources needed to keep the connection open on the server will be unavailable for other clients. How much this affects the server's availability and how long the resources are unavailable depend on the server's architecture and configuration. Also a race condition can occur where the client sends a request to the server at the same time that the server closes the TCP connection. A server should send a 408 Request Timeout status code to the client immediately before closing the connection. When a client receives the 408 status code, after having sent the request, it may open a new connection to the server and re-send the request. Not all clients will re-send the request, and many that do will only do so if the request has an idempotent HTTP method.  Use in web browsers  Schema of multiple vs. persistent connection. All modern web browsers including Google Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer (since 4.01), Opera (since 4.0) and Safari use persistent connections. By default, Internet Explorer versions 6 and 7 use two persistent connections while version 8 uses six. Persistent connections time out after 60 seconds of inactivity which is changeable via the Windows Registry. In Firefox, the number of simultaneous connections can be customized (per-server, per-proxy, total). Persistent connections time out after 115 seconds (1.92 minutes) of inactivity which is changeable via the configuration.

BorderManager is designed as a proxy server, firewall, and VPN access point. Novell has announced that migration to SuperLumin 4.0 Proxy Cache is \\"Novell's preferred firewall and proxy solution for NetWare customers upgrading to Novell Open Enterprise Server on Linux.\\" History BorderManager was designed to run on top of the NetWare kernel and takes advantage of the fast file services that the NetWare kernel delivers. Aside from the more easily copied firewall and VPN access point services, Novell designed the proxy services to retrieve web data with a server to server connection rather than a client to server connection as all of the prior proxy servers on the market had done. This retrieval method along with NetWare's fast file IO and other proprietary code made BorderManager's proxy engine one of the fastest in existence. In 2003, Novell announced the successor product to NetWare: Open Enterprise Server (OES). First released in March 2005, OES completes the separation of the services traditionally associated with NetWare, i.e. file and print. This makes it possible for the customer to choose which NetWare or Linux kernel the services will run on. At this time Novell all but announced the end of development for the NetWare kernel (numerous public and private statements that there is no 64-bit future for NetWare and that Linux is the path to 64-bit computing for OES). To follow through on this migration path, Novell began porting all applications to Linux. The company began looking at alternate ways to deliver these same services, as firewall and VPN access point services of equivalent functionality are readily available in the free/open-source community and there are also basic proxy services as well (i.e. Squid). The desire to deliver a functional equivalent could not be done by a full software code port as much of the cache engine was sold as part of the Volera Excelerator and Novell holds a great desire to use or create open-source software for basic services such as this. Novell entered an agreement with Astaro to relabel Astaro Security Gateway and license it as Novell Security Manager.

History  The airline was created when officials of the supplemental airline Overseas National Airways formed a FAR Part 129 leasing company known as United Air Carriers on July 21, 1977. When the Overseas National Airways folded in 1978, the company was renamed to Overseas National Airways and was certified in 1980 under FAR 121 as a cargo and passenger charter company. In 1982 the company gained approval for scheduled service, leading to the company purchasing the name National Airlines from Pan Am in anticipation of scheduled New York to Paris service. The scheduled service never materialized, although flights on the route were flown as charters. The company faced financial problems and by December 1985 it ceased operations, filing for bankruptcy in May 1986.

In the 2002 census 35,642 citizens of Slovenia identified themselves as Croats.http://www.stat.si/popis2002/en/rezultati/rezultati_red.asp?ter=SLO&st;=7  History  Croats have lived in the Slovene Lands for centuries. Most Croats and Slovenes were for centuries part of the same political entities, first the Habsburg Empire and then Yugoslavia. The number of Croats in the territory of modern Slovenia remained relatively small, as the Slovene lands before the 1950s experienced more emigration than immigration. During most of the history, Croats did not constitute a separate community, and many were assimilated by the Slovene, German or Venetian-speaking populations. After World War I, the number of Croats in Slovenia increased significantly, and more numerous communities were present in Ljubljana, Maribor and Celje. In the 1960s, the number of Croats increased significantly again as the result of a wave of relocation from Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.  Legal status  Unlike two other historic autochthonous minorities of Slovenia, the Hungarians and Italians, the Croats have not been granted minority status, although they are the second largest ethnic minority in Slovenia, after the Serbs (also not granted minority status). According to the Slovenian constitutional framework, only \\"historical minorities who have been living on clearly defined territories for centuries (and the Romani people, who have formed a distinct community since at least the 13th century can have the status of a minority\\". This would carry several constitutionally guaranteed rights, such as visible bilingualism and an autonomous educational system. All remaining minority members are guaranteed the right to express and develop freely their cultural and linguistic heritage, under the same laws applying to citizens in general, but lack the positive discrimination policies applied to the three constitutionally recognized minority communities, as well as the right to have state-sponsored schools in their languages. In 2006, the Croatian Heritage Foundation along with the Federation of Croatian Societies of Slovenia organized the Week of Slovenian Croats in Zagreb as part of the heritage foundation's annual Croatian minority week. Numbers The number of Slovenian citizens of Croatian origin is difficult to establish. According to the 2001 census, 35,642 of them declared themselves as ethnically (\\"nationally\\", according to the Slovenian terminology) Croatian. In the same census, around 54,000 people declared Croatian as their mother tongue.http://www.stat.si/popis2002/gradivo/2-169.pdf Ten years earlier, more than 52,000 Slovenian citizens declared themselves as ethnically Croatian, while the number of those with Croatian as their mother tongue was around 50,000. It seems however that the great majority of Croats living in Slovenia uses Slovene as their primary language of communication. In 2001, only around 2,700 people spoke either Croatian or a combination of Croatian and Slovene at home, which is a significant decrease from in 1991, when their number was around 10,000. Number of self-declared ethnic Croats in Slovenia after World War II: *1948: 16,069 (1.15%) *1953: 17,978 (1.23%) *1961: 31,429 (1.97%) *1971: 41,556 (2.47%) *1981: 53,882 (2.93%) *1991: 52,876 (2.76%) *2002: 35,642 (1.81%) Notable personalities Slovenians of Croat ethnic origin include: *Sreƒçko Katanec, football player and coach born to Croatian parents *Jakov Fak, biathlete *Ivo Brnƒçiƒá, literary critic *Izidor Cankar, essayist, art historian, translator and diplomat born to a Croat-German mother *Robert Kranjec, ski-jumper born to a Croat father *Josip Iliƒçiƒá, football player *≈Ωeljko Ivanek, actor *Jelko Kacin, politician born to a Croat mother *Miljenko Licul, designer *Dragutin Mate, politician and diplomat *Stipe Modriƒá, former basketball player and coach born to a Croat father *Du≈°ko Pavasoviƒç, chess grandmaster; *Dijana Ravnikar, biathlete and cross-country skier; *Ciril Ribiƒçiƒç, jurist and politician *Josip Ribiƒçiƒç, writer born to a Croat father *Mitja Ribiƒçiƒç, communist official and politician *Vanja Rupena, 1996 Miss Croatia *Goran Sankoviƒç, football player *Ante ≈†imund≈æa, former football player born to a Croatian father *Luka ≈†uliƒá, cellist, member of the duo 2Cellos born to a Croat father *Gregor ≈Ωidan, former footballer born to Croatian parents *Oton ≈Ωupanƒçiƒç, poet and translator born to a Croat mother *Jurica Golemac, basketball player and coach See also *Demographics of Slovenia * Croats * List of Croats  References  Slovenia Category:Ethnic groups in Slovenia ","title":"Croats of Slovenia"},{"id":"7716929","title":"Rhinophis"},{"id":"7716931","text":"Chapter01/ is the eleventh Japanese single release from Hitomi Yaida.

Originally called Express Australia,http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/12/04/1070351706564.html?from=storyrhs the organisation is currently listed on the Register of Cultural Organisations. It presents an annual program of special events, workshops, awards and artistic projects throughout the year, to generate opportunities for young and emerging artists. The flagship publication is Voiceworks. In 2005, John Marsden (writer) became, and remains, the principal patron of Express Media supporting an annual prize encouraging creative literary work by young people. In 1988 Express Media began publishing a newsletter, both to promote the organisation‚Äôs program of workshops and as a forum for youth and media issues. The newsletter was called Voiceworks and it was launched by then Prime Minister Bob Hawke and music journalist Ian ‚ÄúMolly‚Äù Meldrum. In the ‚Äò90s, Voiceworks grew into a quarterly magazine, expanding its content to include poetry, short fiction, articles, opinion and illustration contributed by under 25s. Prominent alumni such as Benjamin Law, Liam Pieper, Anna Krien, Hannah Kent, Tom Doig, Lili Wilkinson, Justin Heazlewood and Van Badham have gone on to have a significant impact in the Australian literary, artistic and political landscapes. The magazine has remained in print form and has continued to develop into a well-respected and sophisticated literary journal. In 2015, Voiceworks celebrated its 100th issue. In response to the need for development opportunities and professional pathways for arts and cultural critics, 1997 saw the launch of Express Media‚Äôs Buzzcuts program. In partnership with literary and arts festivals around the country, the program was developed in order to give young journalists experience working with an editor, publication opportunities and exposure to the world of professional arts reviewing and cultural criticism. Following the success of Express Media‚Äôs Make It Up Zine Fair and in response to the burgeoning youth and emerging literary scene in Melbourne, in 2004 Express Media held a two-day series of panels, readings, performances and workshops featuring ‚Äòthe best Australian writers you haven‚Äôt heard of yet‚Äô. This event was the inaugural Emerging Writers‚Äô Festival. While the festival found a strong audience and independence, the two organisations continue to have strong ties and Express Media alumni as well as young writers engaged in our programs feature heavily within the festival each year. In 2005, John Marsden became, and remains, the principal patron of Express Media supporting an annual prize encouraging creative literary work by young people. The patronage of an immensely popular and internationally recognised author has been invaluable in assisting Express Media to encourage and develop the creative skills of young writers, by significantly extending the reach and impact of our programs. In 2010, Express Media became a resident organisation of The Wheeler Centre, as part of Melbourne‚Äôs UNESCO designation as a City of Literature. Since that time, Express Media has nurtured countless innovative new projects and lead initiatives including the Write In Your Face Grants, The Young Writers Innovation Prize, The New Voices Poetry Series, The Under Age, The Signal Express, The Global Express and Dialect, Hologram, Buzzcuts as well as continuing to produce their flagship publication, Voiceworks.https://expressmedia.org.au/about/our-history/ Projects While Express Media's annual program changes in order to meet the developing needs of young Australian writers and voices, as of 2019 Express Media's programs are: * The John Marsden & Hachette Australia Prize for Young Writers.https://expressmedia.org.au/programs/john-marsden-prize/ The John Marsden & Hachette Australia Prize for Young Writers is a developmental award open exclusively to Australian secondary school students in categories of fiction, nonfiction and poetry.

The earliest records for this surname are found in England, Scotland, and Ireland. The use of surnames became necessary when governments introduced personal taxation. In England, heritable surnames started to form in the 11th century, and were common in most areas by 1400. The Poll Tax introduced in England in the 14th Century (considered a head tax) is probably the first time this common usage of surnames was documented. Culbert Origins A specific origin for this name is not known, however it does not appear to be derived from a place, nor from an occupation, two common sources for peoples' names. The following references suggest that Culbert may be derived from other names that describe a person's character. For example, Culbert may stem from Culbheart, which is a Gaelic form meaning \\"crafty\\".William Arthur, An Etymological Dictionary of Family and Christian Names: With an Essay on Their Derivation and Import, Gale Research Co., 1969 However, Culbert is not a Gaelic name. It is possible the earliest Culberts in Ireland came there from Scotland and England as a result of the creation of the Plantations of Ulster in the early 1600s. The earliest Culbert record found to date in Ireland is for James Culbert, born in 1651.International Genealogical Index, Birth in 1651, recorded at Millrow Presbyterian Church, Antrim, County Antrim Also, crafty is related to \\"wisdom,\\" and this suggests a possible connection with the surname Cuthbert, a name from the Anglo Saxon, which means \\"famous, bright, of clear skill or knowledge\\".William Arthur, An Etymological Dictionary of Family and Christian Names: With an Essay on Their Derivation and Import, Gale Research Co., 1969 It is also believed by some researchers that Culbert is derived from Cutbert. This earlier spelling is very similar to Cuthbert and Cuthbertson, one reason for the close relationship between these surnames. The surname is also closely related to Culbertson and Culberson, which mean son of Culbert. With regards to claims of origin, MacLysaghtEdward MacLysaght, 1999, The Surnames of Ireland, 6th Ed., Irish Academic Press, Dublin, Ireland and Portland, Oregon, USA states that the surname Culbert is of Huguenot origin, and is found mainly in Ireland's northern province of Ulster. However, no record has yet been found to document that any Culbert was a Huguenot or a Huguenot descendant.The Culbert Family Genealogy Project, James H. Culbert, Registration No. 4096, Guild of One-Name Studies In Scotland, Culbert is considered a variant of Colbert, derived from the Anglo-Saxon Ceolberht/Ceolbeorht (in Old English, ceol = ship and berht/beorht = bright).Henry Harrison, Surnames of the United Kingdom: A Concise Etymological Dictionary, Vols. 1 & 2., The Eaton Press, 190 Ebury Street, London, S.W,; 1912Dr. George F. Black, 1946, Surnames of Scotland: Their Origin, Meaning and History, New York Public Library, 12th printing, 1999, p. 190, They suggest Culbert is a personal name dating from the 700s in England, however, no actual records have been found in England for another 850 years. Also for England, one heraldry-relate website claims that Culbert is one of the names of people who migrated there from Normandy following the Norman Conquest, and that Culbert has been found in the Counties of Cheshire and Lancashire. Unfortunately, these records also have not been uncovered. The earliest Culbert found in FamilySearch records for Cheshire is William Culbert b. bef. 1706, and for Lancashire is Thomas Culbert b. bef. 1764. The oldest Culbert record found to date anywhere is for Mutton Culbert, who married Alice Legge on 27 Mar 1554 at St. Nicholas, Ipswich, Suffolk, England.International Genealogical Index, Marriage of Mutton Culbert & Alice Legge (1554), Patron ordinance submission sheets, 1969-1991, Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, FHL Film No. 0820453. The earliest home of a Culbertson (son of Culbert) so far found is located in the County of Roxburg, Scotland, at a small village named Morebattle, eight miles south of Kelso. Here Culbertson people have reportedly lived continuously since the year 1400 AD. This is in the Lowlands and is about five miles from the Cheviot Hills, which form the boundary between Scotland and England. Culbert Distribution As migrations from Europe became more common in the 19th and 20th Centuries, Culbert people have spread from Europe and have now become more predominant in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.The Culbert Family Genealogy Project, James H. Culbert, Registration No. 4096, Guild of One-Name Studies For example, in the 1881 Census of the United Kingdom (including England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland), 91 Culbert individuals were indexed, compared to 256 individuals in the 1881 Canada Census, and compared to 620 individuals in the 1880 U.S. Federal Census. In 2000, the surname Culbert was ranked 12,650 in terms of the most common surnames in the United States, with 2,244 occurrences in the 2000 U.S. Federal Census. The racial/ethnic breakdown included nearly 77 percent White, almost 20 percent Black, a little more than 2 percent Hispanic, about 1 percent Non-Hispanic of two or more races, and minor amounts (less than 1 percent) of Asian and Pacific Islander or American Indian and Alaskan Native.David L.

Folkoperan is one of Stockholm's most successful opera houses in terms of the size of the audience. Over the years, Folkoperan has come to be known as Sweden's most important stage for freelance opera singers and musicians. History Folkoperan was founded in 1976 by Claes Fellbom, Kerstin Nerbe, and Krister Fagerstr√∂min. The opera house is located in a building which was designed by architect H√∂√∂g & Morssing in elegant 1920s Nordic Classicism. It was first erected by the cinema owner and builder John A. Bergendahl (1872-1958) at the site of the former Maria saluhall. At that time it was one of Stockholm's largest cinemas with 1,002 seats. As a theatre institute, Folkoperan receives annual funding from the Swedish Arts Council, the Stockholm County Council, and the City of Stockholm. Over the years, Folkoperan has functioned as an antithesis to the Royal Swedish Opera in Stockholm. It has become much appreciated by the Swedish opera audience due to its smaller more intimate stage and unconventional productions. Folkoperan celebrated its 25th anniversary with the new opera, Jeppe: The Cruel Comedy, written and directed by Claes Fellbom and composed by Sven-David Sandstr√∂m (1942‚Äì2019).

The Haunting of Toby Jugg is a 1948 psychological thriller novel on an occult theme by English writer Dennis Wheatley, incorporating his usual themes of satanic possession and madness, in what was at that time a fresh situation: a disabled British airman recovering from his experiences in the last stages of World War II, in which he played a part in the bombardment of Germany. Toby is the heir to a vast fortune and stands to inherit his grandfather's business empire on his twenty-first birthday. Toby's mother died in childbirth and his father and grandfather were killed in an aircraft accident, leaving his Uncle Paul and Aunt Julia as his only living relatives. While taking part in a bombing raid on Cologne, he is shot in the back. The resulting injury means Toby is paralysed below the waist and uses a wheelchair. At first he goes to live with his uncle and aunt but later is sent to convalesce in Wales with his old school teacher who is also a family friend. It is at this point that the book, which is written as a diary, begins. Toby is being haunted by a many-legged, evil and shadowy presence that the young airman comes to believe is the Devil himself. Helmuth Lisicky, the man in charge of the castle in Wales where Toby is taken to recuperate, proves to be a member of a Satanist brotherhood and sends manifestations against Toby such as a plague of spiders. At first Toby thinks he is hallucinating and then going mad, a view shared by his guardian; finally he believes himself to be at the centre of a sinister plot to cheat him out of his inheritance.

Origin The ship, along with her three sister ships , and , had originally been ordered by Argentina from the English shipyard Cammell Laird in Birkenhead. Leon was originally named Tucum√°n. They were purchased in 1912 by Greece, ready for delivery, each for the sum of ¬£148,000, when the Balkan Wars seemed likely. Service history During the Balkan Wars, the Royal Hellenic Navy purchased only the minimum amount of ammunition, 3,000 rounds. Torpedoes were not available for this class of ship, and for this reason these ships were initially named 'scouts' rather than 'destroyers'. Leon was in action during the Balkan Wars under Lieutenant Commander J. Razikotsikas, also on board was Squadron Commander Lieutenant Commander D. Papachristos. During World War I, Greece belatedly entered the war on the side of the Triple Entente and, due to Greece's neutrality the four Aetos-class ships were seized by the Allies in October 1916, taken over by the French in November, and served in the French Navy from 1917-18. By 1918, they were back on escort duty under Greek colors, and was in action blockading the coasts of the Black Sea from Bosphorus up to Trebizond. On 22 December 1921, while moored with Ierax in Piraeus harbour they were both severely damaged by the explosion of a depth charge which the crew of Leon was transporting. Two officers, one petty officer and two sailors were killed on Leon and two sailors on Ierax. Leon completely lost her aft section up to her stern gun. After the war, Leon was refurbished from 1925‚Äì1927. She also participated in the Second World War, On 18 April 1941, during a convoy escort, she collided with the passenger ship followed by the explosion of two depth charges. As a result, her stern section was cut off and two officers were killed. She was finally sunk by German bombers on 15 May 1941, in Souda Bay (Crete) where she had been towed from Salamis Naval Base.

She is the daughter of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs and Chrisann Brennan. Jobs initially denied paternity for several years, which led to a legal case and various media reports in the early days of Apple. Lisa and Steve Jobs eventually reconciled, and he accepted his paternity. Brennan-Jobs later worked as a journalist and magazine writer. An early Apple business computer, the Apple Lisa, is named after Brennan-Jobs, and she has been depicted in a number of biographies and films, including the biopics Pirates of Silicon Valley, Jobs, and Steve Jobs. A fictionalized version of her is a major character in her aunt Mona Simpson's novel A Regular Guy. Birth Lisa Nicole Brennan was born on May 17, 1978 on Robert Friedland's All One Farm commune outside Portland, Oregon. Her mother, Chrisann Brennan, and her father, Steve Jobs, first met at Homestead High School in Cupertino, California in 1972 and had an on-off relationship for the next five years. In 1977, after Jobs had co-founded Apple Inc., he and Brennan moved into a house with their friend Daniel Kottke near the company's office in Cupertino, where they all worked. It was during this period that Brennan became pregnant with Lisa. Jobs, however, did not assume responsibility for the pregnancy, which led Brennan to end the relationship, leave their shared home, and support herself by cleaning houses. In 1978, Brennan moved to the All One Farm commune to have the baby. Jobs was not present for the baby's birth and only came up three days later after Robert Friedland, the farm's owner and a friend of Jobs from Reed College, persuaded him to do so. Brennan and Jobs named the baby Lisa. Jobs named the computer project he was working on, the Apple Lisa, after her. Shortly after, Jobs publicly denied that he was the child's father. He claimed that the Apple Lisa was not named for her, and his team had come up with the phrase \\"Local Integrated System Architecture\\" as an alternative explanation for the project's name. Decades later, Jobs admitted that \\"obviously, it was named for my daughter\\". Paternity case and reconciliation After Lisa was born, Jobs publicly denied paternity, which led to a legal case. Even after a DNA paternity test established him as her father, he maintained his position. The resolution of the legal case required him to provide Brennan with $385 per month and to reimburse the state for the money she had received from welfare. After Apple went public and Jobs became a multimillionaire, he increased the payment to $500 a month. Michael Moritz interviewed Jobs, Brennan, and a number of others for the 1982 Time Person of the Year special issue, released on January 3, 1983. In his interview, Jobs questioned the reliability of the paternity test, which had found that the \\"probability of paternity for Jobs, Steven... is 94.1%\\". Jobs responded by arguing that \\"28% of the male population of the United States could be the father\\". Rather than name him \\"Person of the Year\\", as he and many others expected while giving the interviews, the issue was instead titled \\"Machine of the Year: The Computer Moves In\\". The thematic change occurred after Moritz heard about Brennan-Jobs as well as Jobs' management style. Years later, after Jobs left Apple, he acknowledged Lisa and attempted to reconcile with her. Chrisann Brennan wrote that \\"he apologized many times over for his behavior\\" to her and Lisa and \\"said that he never took responsibility when he should have, and that he was sorry\\". After reconciling with her, nine-year-old Lisa wanted to change her last name and Jobs was happy and relieved to agree to it. Jobs legally altered her birth certificate, changing her name from Lisa Brennan to Lisa Brennan-Jobs. Brennan credits the change in Jobs to the influence of Brennan-Jobs' newly found biological aunt, author Mona Simpson, who worked to repair the relationship between Brennan-Jobs and her father. According to Fortune magazine, in his will, Jobs left Lisa a multi-million dollar inheritance. Education and career When Brennan-Jobs was living with her mother, she attended The Nueva School and Lick Wilmerding High School. Later, after she had moved in with her father, she attended Palo Alto High School. She enrolled at Harvard University in 1996 and studied overseas for one year at King's College London. While a student at Harvard, she wrote for The Harvard Crimson. She graduated in 2000 and subsequently moved to Manhattan to work as a writer. She has written for The Southwest Review, The Massachusetts Review, The Harvard Advocate, Spiked, Vogue, and O, The Oprah Magazine. Publications In March 2018, Brennan-Jobs announced that she was writing Small Fry, a memoir detailing her childhood and the complex and sometimes difficult relationship she had with her father. The book was published on September 4, 2018. In media Brennan-Jobs has been portrayed in several biographies of her father, including Walter Isaacson's 2011 authorized biography Steve Jobs. Mona Simpson's 1996 novel A Regular Guy is a fictionalized account based on the story of Brennan-Jobs and her parents. She has been depicted in three biopic films: Brooke Radding portrayed her in the 1999 TNT TV film Pirates of Silicon Valley, while she is played as a child by Ava Acres, and as an adult by Annika Bertea, in the 2013 film Jobs. In the 2015 film Steve Jobs, directed by Danny Boyle, Brennan-Jobs is portrayed at different ages by Perla Haney-Jardine, Ripley Sobo, and Makenzie Moss. Steve Jobs screenwriter Aaron Sorkin said that he discussed the screenplay with Brennan-Jobs in advance and that she is the \\"heroine of the film\\". Personal life Brennan-Jobs resides in Brooklyn with her husband, Bill, their son, and her two stepdaughters.

For instance, product design can require modification of sound level or noise for compliance with standards from ANSI, IEC, and ISO. The work might also involve design fine-tuning to meet market expectations. Here, examples include tweaking an automobile door latching mechanism to impress a consumer with a satisfying click or modifying an exhaust manifold to change the tone of an engine's rumble. Aircraft designers are also using acoustic instrumentation to reduce the noise generated on takeoff and landing. Acoustical measurements and instrumentation range from a handheld sound level meter to a 1000-microphone phased array.  Components  Most of the acoustical measurement and instrumentation systems can be broken down into three components: sensors, data acquisition and analysis. = Sensors = The most common sensor used for acoustic measurement is the microphone. Measurement-grade microphones are different from typical recording-studio microphones because they can provide a detailed calibration for their response and sensitivity. Other sensors include hydrophones for measuring sound in water or accelerometers for measuring vibrations causing sound. The three main groups of microphones are pressure, free-field, and random-incidence, each with their own correction factors for different applications.G.R.A.S. Sound & Vibration has a selection guide detailing the difference between microphones. Well-known microphone suppliers include PCB Piezotronics, Br√ºel & Kj√¶r, GRAS and Audio Precision.Measurement Microphones & Acoustic Test Accessories = Data acquisition = Data acquisition hardware for acoustic measurements typically utilizes 24-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), anti-aliasing filters, and other signal conditioning. This signal conditioning may include amplification, filtering, sensor excitation, and input configuration. Another consideration is the frequency range of the instrumentation. It should be large enough to cover the frequency range of signal interest, taking into account the range of the sensor. To prevent aliasing, many devices come with antialiasing filters, which cut the maximum frequency range of the device to a little less than one- half the maximum sampling rate, as prescribed by the Nyquist sampling theorem. Dynamic range is a common way to compare performance from one instrument to another. Dynamic range is a measure of how small you can measure a signal relative to the maximum input signal the device can measure. Expressed in decibels, the dynamic range is 20 log (Vmax/Vmin). For example, a device with an input range of ¬±10 V and a dynamic range of 110 dB will be able to measure a signal as small as 10 ¬µV. Thus, the input range and the specified dynamic range are important for determining the needs of your instrumentation system. = Analysis = Audio and acoustic analysis includes: fractional-octave analysis, sound-level measurements, power spectra, frequency response measurements, and transient analysis. Results are viewed on waterfall displays, colormap displays, and octave graphs.

Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution, 91: 194-209.  Distribution  Polyura butterflies are native to the Indomalayan and Australasian realms. They are widespread from Pakistan to Okinawa Island, and from China to Pacific Islands (Fiji, New Caledonia, Vanuatu).  Systematics  * The subgenus Polyura was described by the Swedish naturalist Gustaf Johan Billberg in 1820. * The type species is Polyura pyrrhus (Linnaeus).  Taxonomy  The subgenus was revised in 1982 by Robert Leslie Smiles based on morphological characters. The genus Polyura was synonymized with the genus Charaxes in 2009 in a study investigating phylogenetic relationships among Charaxini using DNA sequencing. However the genus Charaxes comprises many morphologically very different groups such as the subgenera Euxanthe and Polyura. A phylogenomic study is ongoing to resolve the phylogenetic placements of these different groups. The sister-group to Polyura seems to comprise the African species Charaxes paphianus and Charaxes pleione. Southeast Asian species of the genus Charaxes do not seem to be closely related to species of the subgenus Polyura. A comprehensive molecular phylogeny of the subgenus as well as several taxonomic studies have allowed a complete revision of the group.New Insights into the Systematics of the Genus Polyura Billberg, 1820 (Nymphalidae, Charaxinae) with an Emphasis on the P. athamas Group ¬ª, Journal of the Lepidopterists' Society, vol. 70, no 2, 1er juin 2016, p. 145‚Äì152Toussaint, E.F., Morini√®re, J., Lam, A. and Turlin, B., 2016.

A follow-up study investigating the biogeographical history of the subgenus suggested an origin in the Miocene about 12 million years ago in mainland Asia.

It is notable as one of only two known instances of a historical map actually using the phrase HC SVNT DRACONES (in Latin hic sunt dracones means \\"here are dragons\\".)  Description  alt= The Lenox Globe is a hollow copper globe that measures in diameter and in circumference. It is two parts, joined at the equator and held together by a wire strung through holes at the poles. It bears a striking resemblance to the Globus Jagellonicus, dating from 1510.Missinne, Stefaan, The Da Vinci Globe, op.cit.pp 90-96. The phrase HIC SVNT DRACONES appears on the eastern coast of Asia.  Background  The method of construction of this globe was unknown until the publication on the Ostrich Egg Globe dating from 1504 by S.

It was purchased in Paris in 1855 by architect Richard Morris Hunt, who gave it to James Lenox, whose collection became part of the New York Public Library, where the globe still resides. In his recollections, Henry Stevens recalled seeing the globe while dining with Hunt in 1870. Hunt was ambivalent about the globe, which he bought \\"for a song\\", and was allowing his children to toy with it. Stevens recognized its value and urged Hunt to store it in the Lenox Library, which he was designing at the time. Stevens also borrowed the globe to ascertain its age with the help of Julius Erasmus Hilgard, who worked for the Coast Survey‚Äîa predecessor to the US National Geodetic Survey.  Publications  The Lenox Globe, by B.F. De Costa The earliest known article on the globe was written by B. F. de Costa for the Magazine of American History in September 1879. Gabriel Gravier reprinted the article with additional comments in the Bulletin de la soci√©t√© normande de g√©ographie later that year.\\"Le Globe Lenox\\", Bulletin de la soci√©t√© normande de g√©ographie (Oct‚ÄìDec. 1879), pp. 216‚Äì228.

These > people... feasted upon the dead and picked their bones (B.II. c.14, > Ramusio's ed.) In his translation of Da Costa's article, Gabriel Gravier adds that Marco Polo's Kingdom of Dagroian is in Java Minor, or Sumatra, well away from the spot indicated on the Lenox Globe. The flat drawing of the globe which accompanied the early articles is reproduced as map 7 in Emerson D.

Story behind the hit Before this hit single, Ruth Brown was thought of strictly as a torch singer. When Ruby Toombs showed her the song Brown was initially reluctant to do it as it was so rhythmically different from the popular standards and ballads she was comfortable singing. The change of tempo, the backbeat of four/four, at first led her to dig in her heels. But Ahmet Erteg√ºn, sensing the time was right, urged her to give the song a try and so she went along with his choice of tunes for her. The song featured a tenor solo by Budd Johnson. Atlantic used a process that it would repeat over the years, that is, turning an uptown singer funky.

They are commonly known as darts. They are found from South Asia to East Asia, and down to maritime Southeast Asia (though not extending towards New Guinea). It includes about 35 species, all of which look very similar to each other and are often only reliably identifiable through the examination of the male genitalia. Potanthus species are sun-loving diurnal flyers. They are usually found in primary and secondary forests, as well as in partly cleared areas, grasslands, and near small villages. Occasionally they may be found in swamps and mangrove forests. The larvae feed on Bambusa (bamboo) and Dendrocalamus (both Gramineae).

The square is listed as Public Square Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places, encompassing 58 contributing buildings, one contributing site, and three contributing objects. Description Public Square's North Side. The modern office building on the left blends in with the 19th-century buildings to its right. The square is rectangular in shape. Buildings line all four sides of the square, while a large oval park sits in its center. A one-way traffic pattern circles the park. Seven of Watertown's main streets (including U.S. Route 11, New York State Route 3, New York State Route 12, and New York State Route 283) intersect at the square, making it a heavy traffic destination for motorists. While the square boasts some modern architecture, its main character is defined by the numerous 19th- and early 20th-century buildings that still stand. Throughout its buildings, the square is host to a multitude of shops, restaurants, business offices, churches and apartment houses, making it a major shopping and business destination in the city. History Public Square's East Side circa 1865. A panoramic view of Public Square circa 1909. Watertown's first settlers built their homesteads on what is now the square's West End in 1800. In 1805, several settlers donated land for public use which became the basis of the square. This helped to develop the square as Watertown's main business district. The current layout of the square and its surrounding streets developed in those early years. Note: This includes and Accompanying 46 photographs and In 1849, most of Public Square and buildings on three adjacent streets were destroyed by fire. The square was immediately rebuilt. Several buildings erected during the rebuilding still stand. In the rebuilding of the 1850s, the city created three parks at the square's center, with a fountain inside the center park. During Watertown's industrial boom in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Public Square became the heart of Watertown's retail, business and social life. In the 1950s, the three parks in the square's center were combined into one large park. The Soldiers and Sailors Monument was added in 1891. The square's retail and business dominance started declining in the latter half of the 20th century. Urban renewal policies during the 1960s and 1970s resulted in the demolition of some of the square's historic structures. Declining industry hurt Watertown's once prospering economy. Although nearby the Fort Drum military reservation expanded in the 1980s and brought growth to the Watertown, modern shopping malls and retail chains built on the city's west side drew business away from the square. Public Square's days as the city's main retail destination were at an end. The square continued its slow decline over the next 20 years. Today New landscaping and brickwork adorn Public Square Park after the completion of the multimillion-dollar renovation project in 2008. The beginning of the 21st century saw a reversal in attitudes towards Public Square. With a resurgence of pride in the square and its role in Watertown's history, civic and business leaders have taken a strong role in its redevelopment. Existing buildings were refurbished and new businesses moved in. Some decaying structures beyond repair were demolished. In 2006, the new economic development was coupled with a multimillion-dollar streetscape project to reinforce the square's infrastructure, as well as beautify its roads, walkways and landscaping. This project was completed in November, 2008. Public Square notables The Paddock Arcade Public Square has been the site of many notable people, buildings and inventions. * Noted sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens designed the monument to New York Governor Roswell P. Flower in 1902. It is the visual focal point of lower Washington Street. *Public Square is home to the Paddock Arcade. Built in 1850, the Arcade boasts to be the oldest continuously operating covered mall in the United States. It is listed separately on the National Register of Historic Places. *Abolitionist Frederick Douglass spoke at Washington Hall and was a guest at the square's renowned Woodruff Hotel in the 1850s. He is noted for insisting on using the front entrance and eating in the hotel's public dining room. Worried about local prejudices, the hotel managers had wanted him to use a rear entrance and stay away from the public areas. *Frank Winfield Woolworth worked as a clerk in Smith and Moore's department store on Public Square in the 1870s. He came up with the idea to set up a table of discount merchandise and fix the price of the items at five and ten cents apiece. So successful were the sales that he was inspired to start his own store based on the same idea. He opened his first store in Utica, NY, starting the Woolworths chain of department stores. *Julius S√§mann invented the Little Trees car air freshener in the Electric Building on Public Square in the 1950s. These car air fresheners resemble small pine trees and hang from an automobile's rearview mirror, and are known worldwide. Car Freshner Corporation maintains its corporate headquarters and a manufacturing plant in Watertown, while it has expanded to include factories in several other cities around the United States.

Radio Jo Stafford at her radio show in 1949. The Chesterfield Supper Club began on December 11, 1944, as a 15-minute radio program, airing at 7 pm weeknights on the NBC Radio Network. This musical variety show was sponsored by Chesterfield cigarettes and featured live musical performances. Perry Como initially hosted The Chesterfield Supper Club five nights a week. Initially, Como's female singer was Mary Ashworth. The idea for the radio show originated with Doug Storer, who was then an advertising executive with the Blackman Company. Storer had heard Perry Como on his non-sponsored CBS radio program and believed he would do well in a radio show of the type he was proposing. Storer recorded a demo of the radio show with Como as its host and Mitchell Ayres and his Orchestra providing the music. He took the recording to the advertising agency that handled the Chesterfield cigarettes account. The agency was enthusiastic about the program's format, but did not want Como as its host. The singer the agency preferred was under contract and would need to be released from it before he could accept a job on the new radio program. They asked Storer to get the singer released from his contract. Storer, who was still of the belief that the new show needed Como as its host, did not go through with the advertising agency's request. He received a call from the agency some weeks later, asking about the singer's contract and saying their new program would make its radio debut in about one week's time. Storer told them the right man for the radio show was the one who had made the demo recording-Perry Como. Chesterfield's advertising agency did not have time to do anything but sign Como as the host of the show. During the first year, Como was backed by the Ted Steele Orchestra, followed by the Lloyd Shaffer Orchestra at the end of 1945 until 1948. With John Klenner, Shaffer and Steele composed the show's theme song, \\"Smoke Dreams.\\" Roy Ringwald's \\"A Cigarette, Sweet Music and You\\" was also used on the show as a musical theme. The Satisfiers vocal group was also part of the program; they also made many records with Como. Sam Berman caricature of Como and Stafford, 1947. Beginning on the show's second anniversary, he hosted the show on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, while Jo Stafford was the host on Tuesdays and Thursdays.(subscription required) Stafford returned to California shortly after becoming a co-host of the program. She began her twice-weekly broadcasts from Hollywood in November 1946, backed by her future husband, Paul Weston. Stafford's Hollywood \\"Club\\" broadcasts featured the vocal group The Starlighters; in 1947 she recorded her version of the show's theme song, \\"Smoke Dreams\\", with them. One of the regular features was a \\"Hollywood Star of the Week\\" contest where an actor or actress would be featured as a \\"guest star\\" singing a song and the listening audience would guess the star's identity for prizes. The \\"mystery star\\" contest continued when the show appeared on television. The broadcasts of April 5, 1946, made from a TWA plane at an altitude of 20,000 feet, are believed to be the first network radio broadcasts from an airplane. Jo Stafford, Perry Como, and the entire staff made the flight. There were two mid-air Supper Club broadcasts: one at 6 pm and another at 10 pm for the West Coast. A total of three flights were made; an earlier rehearsal flight for reception purposes was also made.(PDF) In addition to the cast and the band's instruments, there was also a small piano on board. The three stand-held microphones brought onto the plane turned out to be less useful than expected. The cast then resorted to hand-held microphones, but the plane's cabin pressure made them very heavy and difficult to hold after a few minutes. Less than two months after the airborne Supper Club broadcasts, Chesterfield had an idea to take the program on a week of remote broadcasts: flying into Washington, DC for the Monday show, to London, for the Wednesday one and winding up with the Friday night show in Havana. The plan appears to have fallen from favor when it was learned that the taxes which would have been imposed on the Shaffer orchestra as foreign musicians performing in the UK meant Chesterfield would have needed to pay all orchestra members three times the amount of salary they were receiving at the time. By 1947, announcer Martin Block was based in the Los Angeles area. Block did the announcing from Hollywood on the same days that Stafford hosted the show. Announcer and sportscaster Mel Allen took over the New York announcing duties for that year. When Block's West Coast contract was up, he returned to New York as the show's announcer. Block was also the announcer for the Supper Club television show. {  Promotional postcard for the show from 1945.  Promotional bookmark/calendar for the show from 1947.

In 1948, singer Peggy Lee was added to the roster, taking over the Thursday broadcast. Como was still broadcasting from New York, now backed by the Mitchell Ayres orchestra. The Satisfiers were replaced by the singing Fontane Sisters, who also appeared with Como on the televised Supper Club and his later television shows. Both Stafford and Lee broadcast from Hollywood. Stafford continued to be backed by Paul Weston and his orchestra while Peggy Lee was backed by her husband, Dave Barbour, and his orchestra. The show featured musical performances by the host, along with various guest singers and orchestras, including Frank Sinatra, Judy Garland, Eddie Fisher, the Glenn Miller Orchestra, Nat King Cole, Victor Borge and others. By September 1949, the show's time was extended from 15 minutes to a half-hour, and it was changed from a weekday to a weekly program. Beginning in February 2010, Sounds of Yesteryear began issuing CDs created from Armed Forces Radio Service (AFRS) transcriptions of the program from the years 1946 and 1947: At the Supper Club, At the Supper Club Part II, and At the Supper Club Part III for Perry Como, At the Supper Club, At the Supper Club Part II, At the Supper Club Part III for Jo Stafford, and At the Supper Club for Peggy Lee. Television The Chesterfield Supper Club appeared as a simulcast on NBC Television, beginning Christmas Eve, 1948, with a live performance by Perry Como. This was the beginning of Como's long-standing tradition of television Christmas specials. Initially, NBC had intended to broadcast three Friday night Supper Club shows on television as well as radio. The experiment had gone well enough for NBC to extend the experimental phase of televising The Chesterfield Supper Club through August 1949. On September 8, 1949, Supper Club became a regularly scheduled television program. This series was the first of four regular primetime musical variety TV series hosted by Perry Como. He continued to host The Chesterfield Supper Club until 1950, when he moved to CBS and the NBC series ended. However, his association with Chesterfield continued with the Perry Como Chesterfield Show until 1955, when he returned to NBC.

While the discussion about math skills has persisted for many decades,Report, National Mathematics Advisory Panel, January 2007 the term \\"math wars\\" was coined by commentators such as John A. Van de WalleReform Mathematics vs. The Basics: Understanding the Conflict and Dealing with It, John A. Van de Walle Virginia Commonwealth University; \\"Debate has degenerated to 'math wars'\\" and David Klein. The debate is over traditional mathematics and reform mathematics philosophy and curricula, which differ significantly in approach and content. Advocates of reform The largest supporter of reform in the US has been the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. One aspect of the debate is over how explicitly children must be taught skills based on formulas or algorithms (fixed, step-by-step procedures for solving math problems) versus a more inquiry-based approach in which students are exposed to real-world problems that help them develop fluency in number sense, reasoning, and problem-solving skills. In this latter approach, conceptual understanding is a primary goal and algorithmic fluency is expected to follow secondarily. Some parents and other stakeholders blame educators saying that failures occur not because the method is at fault, but because these educational methods require a great deal of expertise and have not always been implemented well in actual classrooms. A backlash, which advocates call \\"poorly understood reform efforts\\" and critics call \\"a complete abandonment of instruction in basic mathematics,\\" resulted in \\"math wars\\" between reform and traditional methods of mathematics education. Critics of reform Those who disagree with the inquiry-based philosophy maintain that students must first develop computational skills before they can understand concepts of mathematics. These skills should be memorized and practiced, using time-tested traditional methods until they become automatic. Time is better spent practicing skills rather than in investigations inventing alternatives, or justifying more than one correct answer or method. In this view, estimating answers is insufficient and, in fact, is considered to be dependent on strong foundational skills. Learning abstract concepts of mathematics is perceived to depend on a solid base of knowledge of the tools of the subject. Supporters of traditional mathematics teaching oppose excessive dependence on innovations such as calculators or new technology, such as the Logo language. Student innovation is acceptable, even welcome, as long as it is mathematically valid. Calculator use can be appropriate after number sense has developed and basic skills have been mastered. Constructivist methods which are unfamiliar to many adults, and books which lack explanations of methods or solved examples make it difficult to help with homework. Compared to worksheets that can be completed in minutes, constructivist activities can be more time-consuming. (Reform educators respond that more time is lost in reteaching poorly understood algorithms.) Emphasis on reading and writing also increases the language load for immigrant students and parents who may be unfamiliar with English. Critics of reform point out that traditional methods are still universally and exclusively used in industry and academia. Reform educators respond that such methods are still the ultimate goal of reform mathematics, and that students need to learn flexible thinking in order to face problems they may not know a method for. Critics maintain that it is unreasonable to expect students to \\"discover\\" the standard methods through investigation, and that flexible thinking can only be developed after mastering foundational skills. Commentators have argued that there is philosophical support for the notion that \\"algorithmic fluency\\" requires the very types of cognitive activity whose promotion reform advocates often claim is their approaches' unique virtue.\\"The Faulty Logic of The Math Wars\\"/ However, such arguments assume that reformers do not want to teach the standard algorithms, which is a common misunderstanding of the reform position. Some curricula incorporate research by Constance Kamii and others that concluded that direct teaching of traditional algorithms is counterproductive to conceptual understanding of math. Critics have protested some of the consequences of this research. Traditional memorization methods are replaced with constructivist activities. Students who demonstrate proficiency in a standard method are asked to invent another method of arriving at the answer. Some parents have accused reform math advocates of deliberately slowing down students with greater ability in order to \\"paper-over\\" the inequalities of the American school system. Some teachers supplement such textbooks in order to teach standard methods more quickly. Some curricula do not teach long division. Critics believe the NCTM revised its standards to explicitly call for continuing instruction of standard methods, largely because of the negative response to some of these curricula (see below). College professors and employers have sometimes claimed that students that have been taught using reform curricula do not possess basic mathematical skills. One study found that, although first-grade students in 1999 with an average or above-average aptitude for math did equally well with either teacher-directed or student-centered instruction, first-grade students with mathematical difficulties did better with teacher-directed instruction. Reform curricula Examples of reform curricula introduced in response to the 1989 NCTM standards and the reasons for initial criticism: * Mathland (no longer offered) * Investigations in Numbers, Data, and Space is criticized for not containing explicit instruction of the standard algorithms * Core-Plus Mathematics Project, criticized for failing \\"to convey critical mathematical concepts and ideas that should and can be within reach for high school students\\", downplaying \\"algebraic structure and skills\\" and inability to build geometry up from foundations in a mathematically sound and coherent way\\". * Connected Mathematics, criticized for not explicitly teaching children standard algorithms, formulas or solved examples * Everyday Math, also known as \\"Fuzzy Math\\", criticized for putting emphasis on non-traditional arithmetic methods. Critics of reform textbooks say that they present concepts in a haphazard way. Critics of the reform textbooks and curricula support traditional textbooks such as Singapore math, which emphasizes direct instruction of basic mathematical concepts, and Saxon math, which emphasizes frequent cumulative review. Reform educators have responded by pointing out that research tends to show that students achieve greater conceptual understanding from standards-based curricula than traditional curricula and that these gains do not come at the expense of basic skills. In fact students tend to achieve the same procedural skill level in both types of curricula as measured by traditional standardized tests. More research is needed, but the current state of research seems to show that reform textbooks work as well as or better than traditional textbooks in helping students achieve computational competence while promoting greater conceptual understanding than traditional approaches. Recent developments In 2000 the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) released the Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (PSSM), which was seen as more balanced than the original 1989 Standards. This led to some calming, but not an end to the dispute. Two recent reports have led to considerably more cooling of the Math Wars. In 2006, NCTM released its Curriculum Focal Points, Curriculum Focal Points, NCTM which was seen by many as a compromise position. In 2008, the National Mathematics Advisory Panel, created by George Bush, called for a halt to all extreme positions. =National Council of Teachers of Mathematics 2006 recommendations= In 2006, the NCTM released Curriculum Focal Points, a report on the topics considered central for mathematics in pre-kindergarten through eighth grade. Its inclusion of standard algorithms led editorials in newspapers like the Chicago Sun Times to state that the \\"NCTM council has admitted, more or less, that it goofed,\\" and that the new report cited \\"inconsistency in the grade placement of mathematics topics as well as in how they are defined and what students are expected to learn.\\" Chicago Sun Times \\"Fuzzy teaching ideas never added up\\" September 13, 2006 NCTM responded by insisting that it considers \\"Focal Points\\" a step in the implementation of the Standards, not a reversal of its position on teaching students to learn foundational topics with conceptual understanding. Francis Fennell, president of the NCTM, stated that there had been no change of direction or policy in the new report and said that he resented talk of ‚Äúmath wars‚Äù.Letter to the New York Times, Francis Fennell The Focal Points were one of the documents consulted to create the new national Common Core Standards, which are being adopted by most of the United States. =National Mathematics Advisory Panel= On April 18, 2006, President Bush created the National Mathematics Advisory Panel, which was modeled after the influential National Reading Panel. The National Math Panel examined and summarized the scientific evidence related to the teaching and learning of mathematics,http://www.ed.gov/about/bdscomm/list/mathpanel/factsheet.htmlNational Mathematics Advisory Panel: Strengthening Math Education Through Research, concluding in their 2008 report, \\"All-encompassing recommendations that instruction should be entirely 'student centered' or 'teacher directed' are not supported by research. If such recommendations exist, they should be rescinded. If they are being considered, they should be avoided. High-quality research does not support the exclusive use of either approach.\\"http://www.ed.gov/about/bdscomm/list/mathpanel/index.htmlFoundations of Success: The Final Report of the National Mathematics Advisory Panel. March 2008. p. 45.\\" The Panel effectively called for an end to the Math Wars, concluding that research showed \\"conceptual understanding, computational and procedural fluency, and problem-solving skills are equally important and mutually reinforce each other. Debates regarding the relative importance of each of these components of mathematics are misguided.\\" The Panel's final report met with significant criticism within the mathematics education community for, among other issues, the selection criteria used to determine \\"high-quality\\" research, their comparison of extreme forms of teaching, and the amount of focus placed on algebra.When Politics Took the Place of Inquiry: A Response to the National Mathematics Advisory Panel‚Äôs Review of Instructional Practices, Jo Boaler See also *New Math ‚Äì a reform in mathematics education in western countries during the late 1950s to the early 1970s *Anti-racist mathematics, efforts to reduce racial bias in mathematics pedagogy *Education in the United States *David Klein *Marian Small *Three- part lesson References Category:Education reform Category:Mathematics education Category:Mathematics education reform Category:Standards-based education Category:Ideological rivalry ","title":"Math wars"},{"id":"7717615","text":"Ricardo Brugada, mostly known as La Chacarita, is a neighbourhood of Asunci√≥n, the capital of Paraguay.

As a tenor saxophonist and band leader in California, Benedetti first heard a record of Parker in the Spring of 1945. Deeply influenced by the player, Benedetti began to study Parker, transcribing solos, building them into set pieces, and working bop into his own playing. A two- week engagement at LA's Hi-De-Ho Club in early 1947, done on discs, was the start of Benedetti's recordings. In 1948, Benedetti headed to New York with bandmate Jimmy Knepper, and recorded Charlie Parker on March 31, and July 7, both of these on a Sears tape recorder. While in New York, Benedetti began to use heroin. Unable to break into the New York music scene, he returned to his parents home in California in 1948. Trying to finance their way back home, Benedetti and Knepper attempt to sell drugs. However, Knepper took the drugs with him back to LA and abandoned Benedetti in New York. Shortly after returning to California, Benedetti discovered he had a rare muscle disease, Myasthenia Gravis. The disease affected his playing, and he soon quit performing in public. The disease ruined his health, and in 1953 he moved in with his parents in Italy. He died on January 20, 1957, at the age of 34. The recordings he made of Parker were something of a jazz legend, until 1988 when these tapes and acetate discs were sold by his brother, Rick Benedetti, to Mosaic Records.

It was composed in 1945 and received its premiere in Paris on May 5, 1946 directed by Robert Lawrence. In the following year the American premiere was given in Los Angeles, Alfred Wallenstein directing. The symphony is Moore's second essay in that form and is dedicated to the memory of Stephen Vincent Ben√©t, who supplied the libretto for Moore's opera The Devil and Daniel Webster. A work of moderate length and a classical conception inspired by Haydn, it represents Moore's fully formed mature style and is unarguably one of his best pieces. Moore himself described it as: \\"an attempt to write in clear, objective, modified classical style, with emphasis on rhythmic and melodic momentum rather than upon sharply contrasted themes or dramatic climaxes\\". It is in four movements, three of which end in a quiet manner. The symphony lasts approximately twenty minutes. Movements =Andante con moto; Allegro giusto= The first movement starts with a solemnly lyric and wistful theme given out by trumpet, then oboe and strings, which is carried out through the first section in a somewhat nostalgic fashion. The calmness is later abandoned in favour of a more lilting and dancelike mood on strings, which moves along in a processional way before a crescendo leads to the short coda ending the movement in silence. This movement features significant more use of percussion, xylophone and triangle, than the other three. =Andante quieto semplice= Whilst the symphony as a whole isn't in any way programmatic, the second movement was in part inspired by a James Joyce poem concerning twilight music. This is understandable, as most of the music is nocturnal save for a few passionate outbursts which may relate to the work In Memoriam of a few years earlier. It is clearly indicative of Moore's ability to write sensitive and heartfelt music. =Allegretto= This is the shortest and most jovial and most obviously neoclassical of all the movements. It starts with a happy and bubbling theme on woodwinds which forms the basis of the whole movement. In the more animated middle section (where the woodwind indulges in some trilling baroquery) a second theme on trumpet is countered by the main theme in a delightfully contrapuntal way before winding down into stillness. =Allegro con spirito= The beginning of the last movement is proclaimed, in a declamatory fashion, on brass only to introduce the robust and energetic main theme which persists throughout. Following the introduction the orchestra leads into a rondo-like section with alternatingly rousing and flowing treatments, where the main theme dominates. After several louder expositions the main theme is played out faster on strings building up a heroic atmosphere and leading to a bursting crescendo of kinetic energy after which a drumroll leads the movement to the spirited closing diminuendo.

The main events of the Malvern Fringe Festival were the annual Malvern May Day and parade, and the annual three-day festival held in June as a fringe to the Elgar Festival. These were often accompanied by musical and other live events throughout the year. History Malvern Fringe Parade Malvern Fringe Festival was founded in 1977 by Adrian Mealing, a teacher in Malvern, in collaboration with Andrew Sleigh, Ian Fearnside and Phil Webb. It originated as a reaction to the Malvern Festival which was perceived to be biased towards classical music and appealing towards a national and international audience rather than a local one. A further concern was the continued requirement for the local Council to underwrite the main festival and the feeling that the public expenditure could be more wisely spent. The founding aims of the Fringe were to produce a popular, varied programme of events for the local people of Malvern, to bridge the gap between the \\"us\\" and \\"them\\" in the arts and to \\"shake it up a bit in Malvern\\". The first year featured 60 events consisting of poetry, world music, folk, jazz, adult and children's theatre performed under the banner of \\"Associated Events\\" due to the main Festival's objections to the term 'Fringe', which they considered to be \\"outside\\" of the Festival. In 1978, to avoid confusion between the programmes for the two festivals, printed with similar designs at the main festival's insistence, Adrian Mealing hand wrote \\"Fringe\\" on over 3000 programmes. As the 1980s approached, the festival grew into a four-week event and the Fringe had established its own identity. Being centrally located between Hereford, Worcester, Gloucester and Cheltenham the Fringe drew a wide audiences from over a 20-mile radius. During the 1980s, the festival attracted hundreds of visitors with a programme of 120 events over a two-week period. In 1982, Malvern Fringe Arts Ltd became a registered charity. By the 1990s, the Fringe programme had grown to a six-week event and was attracting comedy and cabaret acts that were beginning to establish their reputations, including Eddie Izzard, Lee Evans, Jerry Sadowitz, Jim Tavare, Chris Lynam and a double act featuring Linda Smith and Mark Thomas, plus musical acts as varied as Gong, Juicy Lucy, Voodoo Queens and Loop Guru. May Day procession in Church Street May Day procession in Priory Park In 2006 the Fringe re-launched its three-day festival in June, loosely based upon a theme of Elgar's interests. One of the highlights of this festival was a bicycle race (as cycling was one of Elgar's keen interests) up the steep incline of Great Malvern's Church Street. This event was supported by Commonwealth games gold medalist Liam Killeen, who's from Malvern, and was won by Tour de France cyclist, Arnaud Lenoir. The whole three-day festival was attended by over 5,000 people. In the autumn of 2006, the Fringe launched a 'folk weekend' featuring Roy Bailey and Jez Lowe. Malvern May Day The Malvern May Day and Parade are an annual community event which has been held in Priory Park, Great Malvern on the Saturday before the May Bank Holiday since 1993. Local controversy Despite an attendance of over 5,000 people the June 2006 festival has been the subject of much negative coverage in the letters pages of the local newspaper with one correspondent calling upon readers to petition the local Member of Parliament to halt any further Fringe activities.

Education and career Born on February 3, 1844, in Otselic, Chenango County, New York, Ray attended the common schools and Norwich Academy. During the American Civil War, he served as a private in Company B of the Ninetieth New York Volunteers, and as a brigade clerk for the First Brigade, First Division, Nineteenth Army Corps. He was discharged at the close of the war. He read law and was admitted to the bar in November 1867. He then was a farmer and in private practice in Norwich, New York. He was Chairman of the Republican county committee of Chenango County and was a member of the Republican state committee in 1880. Congressional service Ray was elected as a Republican from New York's 21st congressional district to the United States House of Representatives of the 48th United States Congress, serving from March 4, 1883, to March 3, 1885. Following his first term in Congress, he was a member of the board of education of Norwich Academy and Union Free School. He was elected from New York's 26th congressional district to the United States House of Representatives of the 52nd United States Congress and to the five succeeding Congresses and served from March 4, 1891, to September 11, 1902. He was Chairman of the Committee on Levees and Improvements of the Mississippi River in the 54th United States Congress, Chairman of the Committee on Invalid Pensions in the 55th United States Congress and Chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary in the 56th and 57th United States Congresses. He resigned from Congress to accept a federal judgeship. Federal judicial service Ray received a recess appointment from President Theodore Roosevelt on September 12, 1902, to a seat on the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York vacated by Judge Alfred Conkling Coxe Sr. He was nominated to the same position by President Roosevelt on December 2, 1902. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on December 8, 1902, and received his commission the same day. On or about April 29, 1920, President Woodrow Wilson certified Ray involuntarily as disabled in accordance with the act of February 25, 1919, , which entitled the President to appoint an additional judge for the court and provided that no successor to the judge certified as disabled be appointed. Frank Cooper was appointed to the additional judgeship. Ray's service terminated on January 10, 1925, due to his death in Norwich. He was interred in Mount Hope Cemetery in Norwich.

They fought in the French army for ten years, seeing service in several notable engagements, including the Battle of Marignano and the Battle of Pavia.  Origin  The Black Band was created as the Black Guard in 1514 by George, Duke of Saxony, to fight for his claims in East Frisia against Edzard I, Count of East Frisia, in what was to become known as the Saxon feud. It is not clear whether the band was newly founded or a continuation of the Great or Black Guard that had been founded in 1488 by Landsknechts formerly in Imperial service with Maximilian in Flanders. It fought in Northern Germany and Denmark, often against rebellious peasants, until its defeat at the Battle of Hemmingstedt on 17 February 1500. It is possible that at least some F√§hnlein of the Black Guard survived during these fourteen years and were part, if not core, of the new formation. This Black Guard took part in the campaign in East Frisia in 1514 and devastated large parts of it in the process. When the participation of George of Saxony in the Saxon Feud ended in 1515 at the mediation of Charles II, Duke of Guelders and Francis I of France, Charles of Guelders hired them and led them in support of Francis to Italy, where they entered French service. There they joined an existing contingent of 12,000 Landsknechts in French service, originally drafted for a planned invasion of England under the Yorkist pretender Richard de la Pole, that was aborted after the Anglo-French peace treaty of St Germain-en-Laye in 1514. Many of these Landsknechts were originally sent \\"on loan\\" to the French by Maximilian between 1512 and 1513 for service in Italy, notably at Brescia and Ravenna, and had defied his recall to Imperial service. Some of the members of the Black Band also chose not to enter French service and heed that recall. The distinction between both contingents gets lost and most sources call the whole French Landsknecht contingent the \\"Black Band\\" or \\"Black Legion\\" at the time of the Battle of Marignano.  Organization and leadership  The full Landsknecht contingent of Francis I. army in 1515 was initially 17,000 men strong, composed of 12,000 pikemen, 2,000 arquebusiers, 2,000 two-handed swordsmen, and 1,000 halberdiers. Landsknecht contingents are organized in companies or F√§hnlein of up to 500, with actual numbers often being lower than the nominal full strength. Captain of the Black Band in 1525 was Georg Langenmantel, but it was also placed under the command of French officers, such as at Pavia, when it was nominally led by Fran√ßois de Lorraine and Richard de la Pole. By the time of the Battle of Pavia, they are described by Delbr√ºck as 5,000 strong, by Konstam as 4,000 strong.  Campaigns  The Black Band marched into Italy in 1515 in time to fight alongside King Francis I at the Battle of Marignano, where, defending the ditch and supported by artillery, they nonetheless recoiled from the attacking Swiss, but did not break. Eventually they were relieved by the charge of the French gendarme heavy cavalry into the flank of the Swiss attack column. Ten years later they were still in French service and appeared as the lead French infantry square at the Battle of Pavia, led by Francois de Lorraine and Richard de la Pole. In this battle they found themselves heavily outnumbered by two blocks of 12,000 Imperial Landsknechts opposing them, led by Georg von Frundsberg and Max Sittich von Ems. Before the battle Georg Langenmantel, Obrist of the band, stepped out and tried to challenge Frundsberg or Ems to single combat, but was killed by the Imperials in response. Struck in both flanks -- ‚Äúseize[d] ‚Ä¶ as if with tongs‚Äù‚Äîand hacked to pieces, the Black Band was killed almost to the last man, including both of their leaders, and ceased to exist. It was refounded and fought with a strength of 4,000 under Lautrec in the campaign against the Imperial army in Naples. The destruction of that army in August 1528 saw some 2,000 survivors, many of whom found service with the Imperial Landsknechts.  Sources  * Arfaioli, Maurizio.

This effect is described by the term electrical contact resistance (ECR) and arises as the result of the limited areas of true contact at an interface and the presence of resistive surface films or oxide layers. ECR may vary with time, most often decreasing, in a process known as resistance creep. The idea of potential drop on the injection electrode was introduced by William Shockley to explain the difference between the experimental results and the model of gradual channel approximation. In addition to the term ECR, interface resistance, transitional resistance, or just simply correction term are also used. The term parasitic resistance is used as a more general term, of which it is usually assumed that contact resistance is a major component. Sketch of the contact resistance estimation by the transmission line method. Experimental characterization Here we need to distinguish the contact resistance evaluation in two-electrode systems (e.g. diodes) and three-electrode systems (e.g. transistors). For two electrode systems the specific contact resistivity is experimentally defined as the slope of the I-V curve at : :r_c = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial J} \\\\right\\\\\\\\}_{V=0} where J is the current density, or current per area. The units of specific contact resistivity are typically therefore in ohms-square meter, or \\\\Omega \\\\cdot \\\\text{cm}^2. When the current is a linear function of the voltage, the device is said to have ohmic contacts. The resistance of contacts can be crudely estimated by comparing the results of a four terminal measurement to a simple two-lead measurement made with an ohmmeter. In a two- lead experiment, the measurement current causes a potential drop across both the test leads and the contacts so that the resistance of these elements is inseparable from the resistance of the actual device, with which they are in series. In a four-point probe measurement, one pair of leads is used to inject the measurement current while a second pair of leads, in parallel with the first, is used to measure the potential drop across the device. In the four- probe case, there is no potential drop across the voltage measurement leads so the contact resistance drop is not included. The difference between resistance derived from two-lead and four-lead methods is a reasonably accurate measurement of contact resistance assuming that the leads resistance is much smaller. Specific contact resistance can be obtained by multiplying by contact area. It should also be noted that the contact resistance may vary with temperature. Inductive and capacitive methods could be used in principle to measure an intrinsic impedance without the complication of contact resistance. In practice, direct current methods are more typically used to determine resistance. The three electrode systems such as transistors require more complicated methods for the contact resistance approximation. The most common approach is the transmission line model (TLM). Here, the total device resistance R_\\\\text{tot} is plotted as a function of the channel length: :R_\\\\text{tot} = R_\\\\text{c} + R_\\\\text{ch} = R_\\\\text{c} + \\\\frac{L}{W C \\\\mu \\\\left(V_\\\\text{gs} - V_\\\\text{ds}\\\\right)} where R_\\\\text{c} and R_\\\\text{ch} are contact and channel resistances, respectively, L/W is the channel length/width, C is gate insulator capacitance (per unit of area), \\\\mu is carrier mobility, and V_\\\\text{gs} and V_\\\\text{ds} are gate-source and drain- source voltages. Therefore, the linear extrapolation of total resistance to the zero channel length provides the contact resistance. The slope of the linear function is related to the channel transconductance and can be used for estimation of the ‚Äùcontact resistance-free‚Äù carrier mobility. The approximations used here (linear potential drop across the channel region, constant contact resistance, ‚Ä¶) lead sometimes to the channel dependent contact resistance. Beside the TLM it was proposed the gated four-probe measurement and the modified time-of-flight method (TOF). The direct methods able to measure potential drop on the injection electrode directly are the Kelvin probe force microscopy (KFM) and the electric-field induced second harmonic generation. Mechanisms For given physical and mechanical material properties, parameters that govern the magnitude of electrical contact resistance (ECR) and its variation at an interface relate primarily to surface structure and applied load (Contact mechanics). Surfaces of metallic contacts generally exhibit an external layer of oxide material and adsorbed water molecules, which lead to capacitor-type junctions at weakly contacting asperities and resistor type contacts at strongly contacting asperities, where sufficient pressure is applied for asperities to penetrate the oxide layer, forming metal-to-metal contact patches. If a contact patch is sufficiently small, with dimensions comparable or smaller than the mean free path of electrons resistance at the patch can be described by the Sharvin mechanism, whereby electron transport can be described by ballistic conduction. Generally, over time, contact patches expand and the contact resistance at an interface relaxes, particularly at weakly contacting surfaces, through current induced welding and dielectric breakdown. This process is known also as resistance creep. The coupling of surface chemistry, contact mechanics and charge transport mechanisms needs to be considered in the mechanistic evaluation of ECR phenomena. Quantum limit When a conductor has spatial dimensions close to 2\\\\pi/k_\\\\text{F}, where k_\\\\text{F} is Fermi wavevector of the conducting material, Ohm's law does not hold anymore. These small devices are called quantum point contacts. Their conductance must be an integer multiple of the value 2e^2/h, where e is the elementary charge and h is Planck's constant. Quantum point contacts behave more like waveguides than the classical wires of everyday life and may be described by the Landauer scattering formalism. Point-contact tunneling is an important technique for characterizing superconductors. Other forms of contact resistance Measurements of thermal conductivity are also subject to contact resistance, with particular significance in heat transport through granular media. Similarly, a drop in hydrostatic pressure (analogous to electrical voltage) occurs when fluid flow transitions from one channel to another. Significance Bad contacts are the cause of failure or poor performance in a wide variety of electrical devices. For example, corroded jumper cable clamps can frustrate attempts to start a vehicle that has a low battery. Dirty or corroded contacts on a fuse or its holder can give the false impression that the fuse is blown. A sufficiently high contact resistance can cause substantial heating in a high current device. Unpredictable or noisy contacts are a major cause of the failure of electrical equipment. See also * Contact cleaner * Wetting current * Wetting voltage References Further reading * (NB.

Origins Bill Tritt had a keen interest in boats and cars before World War II, when he studied marine architecture and boat-building at California State Teacher's College in Santa Barbara, California. He worked for Douglas Aircraft's Production Planning and Illustration Departments during WWII, and by 1945 had built a number of catamaran sailboats. In 1947, John Green, a yachtsman friend, paid Tritt to design and build a racing sailboat in the range. Fiberglass seemed the logical construction material, and Otto Bayer of Wizard Boats was enlisted as laminator. The boat was named the Green Dolphin, and four were built in various lengths. This was Tritt's first effort in fiberglass-reinforced plastic (FRP). By 1948 he was building small fiberglass sailing dinghies, and built the first ever fiberglass masts and spars for sailboats. This company became the Glasspar Company and moved to larger quarters from Industrial Way in Costa Mesa to Harbor Blvd in Costa Mesa, California, in 1950. By 1951, Glasspar moved again to larger quarters in Santa Ana, California. By the mid-1950s, Glasspar was producing 15 to 20 percent of all fiberglass boats sold in the U.S. By 1958, branch factories were operating in Nashville, Tennessee, Petersburg, Virginia, Olympia, Washington, and Sherman, Texas. Products Glasspar built boats in ranges from car toppers to models and everything in between. Just prior to 1969, when Glasspar was sold off, there were even oceangoing models. Boats were often given Mediterranean-sounding names, and the boat classes within the model were often indicated by a model type then model name, with a hyphen in between. For example, in the range there was a model called the Lido, which came in three configurations: the Sport-Lido, Club-Lido, and Lido (standard). Another line, called the Mariner, included the Sport-Mariner, Club-Mariner, or Mariner (standard) model. Some boat models were also named for areas in and around Southern California, such as Avalon on the island of Catalina and Del Mar, a coastal community north of San Diego. Models included, but were not limited to; * Sea Lion, a 12' runabout * Sears and Roebuck car-topper (developed and built for Sears) * Wing boats for Mantz Aircraft ‚Äì carried under the wings of converted Navy PBYs * Dincat, a 12' sailing dinghy with FG mast * Dinkitten, an 8' sailing dinghy and popular yacht tender with FG mast * Privateer, a 20' cat-ketch rigged sailboat with unstayed fiberglass masts * Balboa ‚Äì a car- topper * Superlight ‚Äì a 10-foot car-topper * Marathon ‚Äì an under- runabout * Lido Series ‚Äì a-14-foot runabout 1956 Glasspar Club Lido * Citation ‚Äì a runabout * Avalon ‚Äì a 16-foot runabout * G3 ‚Äì a high-performance ski boat * SuperG ‚Äì a high-performance ski boat * Seafair Series ‚Äì a cruising class * Flying V-175 ‚Äì a cruising class * del Mar ‚Äì a cabin cruiser * Tacoma ‚Äì an under- runabout * Ventura ‚Äì a fishing cabin cruiser * Meridian 21 ‚Äì a 21-foot fishing cabin cruiser similar to the Ventura * Meridian 25 ‚Äì a ocean fishing boat.

Founded as a Jesuit venture in 1951 along with Trade Unions, it is now an autonomous college, offering full and part-time courses from undergraduate to postgraduate level, in areas related to, among others, psychology, finance, business and computing. All courses are delivered from the IFSC campus in Dublin and across a network of regional centres. NCI's specialist areas include psychology, human resource management, data analytics, management, cloud computing, fintech, accountancy, cybersecurity, education, and finance. NCI is also known for its free public events which include the dot conf digital and web technology conference, the Legends in Your Lunchtime series, the Seven Deadly Skills, In the Psychologists' Chair and Marketing Mavericks.  History  IFSC Campus In 1951, the National College of Ireland started out as the Catholic Workers College, Dublin in Sandford Lodge, Ranelagh.From Catholic Workers' College to National College of Ireland 1951-1998 by Thomas Morrissey, S.J., Vol. 87, No. 347, Studies: An Irish Quarterly Review, Irish Province of the Society of Jesus, 1998. Founded by Fr. Edward Coyne S.J., in association with Trade Unionists such as Walter Beirne\\"Obituary: Mr W. Beirne\\", Irish Times, 30 October 1959 others involved in the college in its initial years included Professor Thomas A. Finlay S.J., and Rev. Edmund Kent S.J. among others. Lectures were led by a handful of dedicated Jesuits two nights a week, with 103 registered students in the first year. Within 10 years, student numbers had dramatically increased. Links with trade unions deepened, as did formal collaborations with employer and management groups. By 1966, nearly 1,300 students from trade union and business management backgrounds were learning together at the re-branded National College of Industrial Relations (NCIR). In 1976 the college achieved recognition by the states National Council for Educational Awards (NCEA), the forerunner of HETAC, for a number of its programmes.Citation for Reverend John Brady SJ on the occasion of the conferring of an Honorary Fellowship by the National College of Ireland , 20 November 2009. The college again re-branded as the National College of Ireland (NCI) in 1998, with an expanded National Campus Network, and an array of outreach programmes across the country. As the College continued to grow, the land and buildings at Sandford Road were transferred by the Jesuits to the NCI Board of Management. The College's Higher Certificate, Bachelor, Higher Diploma, and Master courses are accredited by the Irish government's Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) ; a number of other short term courses are unaccredited. At the turn of the century, NCI relocated to a 0.8 hectare site on Mayor Street in the Dublin Docklands. A‚Ç¨25,000,000 fundraising campaign resulted in the development of a modern campus including 53 residential apartments accommodating 286 students and a new Business and Research Building. In 2009 and 2010 the College ran a series of free debates called the Insight Debate Series, organised in partnership with The Irish Times and the radio station Newstalk 106-108 FM. The college's Legends in your Lunchtime series saw public figures such as Ben Dunne, Willie Walsh and Giovanni Trapattoni interviewed live by a Newstalk presenter.Legends in your Lunchtime Newstalk 106-108FM.

His family then moved to Famagusta and he graduated from the Gymnasium of Famagusta with distinction and being awarded the Palamas Prize. Working for a short time at the Board of Commerce, he then went to England where he studied law and was called to the Bar (Lincoln¬¥s). From 1961 he practiced law in Nicosia.

He resigned from that position in May 2005 in connection with a judgment of the Supreme Court, considering, as he stated in his announcement, that the case ‚Äúis inextricably interwoven with the very essence of the administration of justice, the principles of the rule of law and the democratic principle of the separation of powers.

It was originally broadcast on BBC Radio 4 between 2005 and 2008. The show stars James Fleet as Duncan Stonebridge, a Labour Member of Parliament for the imaginary Rothershurst, which appears to be a marginal constituency in the north of England, one which was traditionally Conservative but turned Labour under Tony Blair. In line with the national trend, the elections of 2005 saw Stonebridge's majority reduced to 27. Stonebridge is a Londoner and, according to his constituency agent Roger (Geoffrey McGivern), was \\"parachuted in by RAF Millbank\\". Plot The show follows the everyday life of the MP. Each episode begins and concludes with Stonebridge travelling on the train from London, and a short, witty dialogue between Stonebridge and a railway attendant. Most episodes then revolve around Stonebridge's attempt to gain publicity in his constituency, ultimately being thwarted by an unlikely twist of fate or bad luck. Stonebridge finds it difficult to fill the shoes of his predecessor, Sir Digby, whose name still looms large in the shape of his widow, Lady Harriet (Geraldine McNulty). In the third series, Harriet becomes Duncan's constituency secretary. He also struggles to keep one step ahead of Angela, his image-conscious and media savvy Conservative rival. It is an ongoing joke that he is secretly attracted to Angela. The middle of each show features Stonebridge's constituency surgery, dealing with problems from constituents of variable sanity, including Mrs Digweed, who insists the constituency needs a badger tunnel, and doesn't believe he's doing enough to get this discussed in Parliament. Other characters include Jane (Rachel Atkins), Duncan's long- suffering sister, and the other members of the constituency team, the aggressive Ruth and the geeky Neil. Various characters are played by Simon Greenall, Beth Chalmers, Manjit Mann and Dan Mersh. Productions The show was typically written and produced only 24 hours before it was broadcast, so it sometimes contained references to current events.

This species' range is further north than the other Mexican species. This bird was formerly known as Coues' flycatcher. Description This species is slightly longer than the olive-sided flycatcher. The adult greater pewee is the largest breeding Contopus flycatcher to breed in the U.S. It is a dull gray-brown bird all over with some birds that have a buff wash on the breast. They have indistinct wingbars and a very distinct crest. The lower mandible is bright orange and that is an easy way to distinguish them from olive-sided flycatchers in eastern Arizona and west central New Mexico. They are 8 inches (20.3 cm) long, have a 13 in (33 cm) wingspan and weigh 1 oz. (28 g). Behavior These birds love to stay high in trees scanning for insects. They sally and hawk insects from their high perches. The greater pewee defends its nesting grounds aggressively. They will attack hawks, jays and squirrels. Their diet consists of insects and maybe berries in cooler months. Their song is a whistled five syllables: deelip deeree! ah or famously known as jose maria. The opening deelip is repeated several times before the rest of the song. It also gives pip calls like the olive-sided flycatcher. Habitat The greater pewee prefers montane pine forests with an oak understory. Also found in montane deciduous especially Arizona sycamore forests and mixed montane oak-pine forest. They are found more easily in elevations over 6,500 feet in Arizona and New Mexico. They are rare in western Texas. Range The greater pewee is found year-round in central and southern Mexico south through Costa Rica and Nicaragua. It breeds from central Mexico north to southeast and central Arizona and southwest New Mexico. Rarely does it reach southern California, southern Nevada or western Texas. Nesting The female builds the nest high in a horizontal fork of a conifer. The nest is compact and attached by cobwebs. It is made of grass and weeds and is decorated with lichen. The nest is usually lined with fine grasses. The female lays three or four creamy white eggs sparsely marked with or wreathed with browns and olive. The eggs are 0.8 in (21 mm).

He is a Bachata artist known worldwide for his hits such as \\"Es Tan Dificil\\", \\"Asesina\\", \\"La Mejor de Todas\\", \\"Ma√±ana en tu Olvido\\", \\"Amiga Veneno\\", \\"La Avispa\\" among others. He is one of the most representative voices in bachata. He is known as \\"La Voz de la Ternura\\" because of his soft and melodic voice.  Early life  Ferre√≠ra was born in 1968 in the town of Amaceyes Tamboril, near Santiago in the Cibao region of the north-western Dominican Republic. Born into a family of musicians and singers, it is not surprising that he dreamed of a musical career as a child. His family filled his childhood home with music spurring Zacar√≠as on to dream of becoming a musical artist. As a young man, his dream motivated him to leave for the country‚Äôs capital, Santo Domingo, where he joined the Conservatorio Nacional and also sang in a local bachata group because he had to \\"earn a living.\\" Ferreira then became a member of the Brugal rum company orchestra, where he remained for five years.  Music career  Ferre√≠ra entered onto the bachata scene in 1997 with his debut album, Me Liber√©. The album won the prestigious Dominican music award, the Cassandra. Three years later his second album, El Triste, won the award for him for a second time. Ferreira became the first bachatero to perform at the Festival de Presidente. In the winter of 2001, Ferreira traveled to the United States for the first time and played 77 gigs in just six-and-a-half weeks in New York City. In 2002, He was the first bachatero to perform at the world-renown S.O.Bs nightclub in Manhattan, New York City. Alongside Jose Manuel \\"El Sultan\\" and Lenny from Aventura, he is one of the first bachateros to incorporate blues and rock elements into the genre. In 2002, he would record one of his biggest hits of all time, \\"Amiga Veneno\\" where he incorporated blues and rock elements like adding the wah effect and an electric guitar solo. The song would take Ferre√≠ra intro the latin mainstream. He then continued to release successful albums each year, spawning hits such as \\"Dime Que Falto\\", \\"Cuanto Duele Que Te Vas\\", \\"La Bomba\\", \\"Quedate Conmigo\\", \\"Me ilusion√©\\", \\"Diez Segundos (feat. Yenddi)\\", \\"Te Lo Pido a Gritos\\", and many more. In 2019, Ferre√≠ra was featured in the song \\"Me Quedo\\" with Romeo Santos. The song is off Romeo's album, Utop√≠a.  Personal Life  In August 17, 2010, Ferre√≠ra inaugurated Escuela Primaria de Amaceyes Arriba, which he rebuilt with his longtime friend Elvis Jes√∫s Rodr√≠guez.

Life Born Heinrich Salem Lehmann in Kiel, in the Duchy of Holstein, he received his first art tuition from his father Leo Lehmann (1782‚Äì1859) and from other painters in Hamburg. In 1831, at the age of 17, he travelled to Paris to study art under Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, becoming one of his most accomplished pupils and a close associate for many years. His first exhibition was at the Salon in 1835 where he won a second-class medal. Thereafter he exhibited regularly at the Salon, winning first-class medals in 1840, 1848 and 1855. Marie d'Agoult, 1843, by Henri Lehmann Lehmann lived in Rome from 1838‚Äì41, where he continued his artistic education with Ingres (who was by then Director of the Acad√©mie de France there), and collaborated with him on some works‚Äîincluding Ingres' painting Luigi Cherubini and the Muse of Lyric Poetry. In Rome Lehmann befriended Franz Liszt and his lover, the author Marie d'Agoult, corresponding with them for many years and painting portraits of them.Pocknell, Pauline in New light on LIszt and his music (Pendragon Press, 1997) pp 142 ff. Lehmann settled permanently in Paris in 1842. He was awarded many commissions for large-scale public works, such as at the H√¥tel de Ville, the Church of Ste-Clothilde, the Palais du Luxembourg, the Palais de Justice, and the Chapel of the Jeunes Aveugles in the Church of Saint-Merri on Rue Saint-Martin. Portrait of Franz Liszt, ca. 1839 He went on to paint portraits of many well-known and distinguished people of the day including Charles Gounod, Victor Cousin, Liszt, Chopin, Stendhal, the Princess Christina Belgiojoso and many others. In 1846 Lehmann received the L√©gion d'honneur and in 1847 became a French citizen, opening his studio in that same year. In 1861 he became a teacher at the famous √âcole des Beaux-Arts and was appointed Professor in 1875. He founded the Lehmann Prize to recognise academic excellence in art. In 1864 he was elected a member of the Institut de France. He died in Paris in 1882.

Name Various etymologies were proposed by the ancients about the origin of the name of the region's inhabitants, the Ozolai (). Some derived it from the Greek verb (ozein) which means \\"to smell\\". According to Strabo, this version could be explained by the stench arising from a spring at the foot of Mount Taphiassus, beneath which Nessus and other centaurs had been buried,Strabo, Geographica, Book IX, online at Perseus while according to Plutarch, that was due to the asphodel which scented the air.Plutarch, Moralia, Book IV, Quaestiones Graecae For the first of these two versions, Pausanias said that, as he had heard, Nessus, ferrying on Evenus, was wounded by Heracles but not killed on the spot, making him escape to this country and when he died, his body rotted unburied, imparting a stench to the atmosphere of the place.Pausanias, Description of Greece, Book 10, Phocis and Ozolian Locri, 38¬ß1, online at Perseus Other variations about the origin of the name from the above verb that Pausanias included in his work Description of Greece are: a) that the exhalations of a river had a peculiar smell and b) that the first dwellers of the region did not know how to weave garments so they wore untanned skins which were smelly. Another version mentioned by Pausanias was that Orestheus, son of Deucalion, king of the land, had a bitch which gave birth to a stick instead of a puppy and Orestheus buried it from which a vine grew in the spring, and from its branches called (ozoi) in Greek, the people got their name. Geography Ozolian Locris is mountainous and for the most part unproductive. The declivities of Mount Parnassus from Phocis on the east, Aselinon oros in the centre and Mount Corax from Aetolia on the west, occupy the greater part of it. The only rivers whose names are mentioned in antiquity are Hylaethus and Daphnus, the latter is nowadays called Mornos, which runs in a southwesterly direction, and flows into the Corinthian gulf near Naupactus. The frontier of the Ozolian Locrians on the west was close to the promontory Antirrhium, opposite the promontory Rhium on the coast of Achaea. The eastern frontier of Locris, on the coast, was close to the Phocian town of Crissa; and the Crissaean gulf washed on its western side the Locrian, and on its eastern the Phocian coast. Ozolian Locris is said to have been a colony from the Opuntian Locrians. The chief town of the Ozolians was Amphissa and their most important port Naupactus. Other important towns of the region were: the coastal town of Chalaeum, on the west of the modern town Itea, Myonia and Tritaea on the foot of Aselinon oros southwest of Amphissa, on the western slope of Parnassus the towns Ipnus, Hessus and Messapia, the coastal town Oeantheia on the western edge of the Crissaean gulf and farther on the west Phaestus, Tolophon, Anticirrha, Erythrae, Eupalium, Oeneon, Macynia and Molycreio which owned Antirrhium. More inland from west to east, were Aegitium, Croculeium, Teichium, Olpae and Hyle. History They first appear in history in the time of the Peloponnesian War, when they are mentioned by Thucydides as a semi-barbarous nation, along with the Aetolians and Acarnanians, whom they resembled in their armour and mode of fighting.Thuc. i. 5, iii. 94. In 426 BCE, the Locrians promised to assist Demosthenes, the Athenian commander, in his invasion of Aetolia; but, after the defeat of Demosthenes, most of the Locrian tribes submitted without opposition to Spartan Eurylochus, who marched through their territory from Delphi to Naupactus.Thuc. iii. 95, seq. They belonged at a later period to the Aetolian League.Polyb. xviii. 30.

He was also the caretaker manager of League One side Notts County after Paul Ince was sacked in 2011. Playing career =West Bromwich Albion= Heggs started his professional career in 1991 with Midlands side, West Bromwich Albion following a ¬£25,000 move from his local side Leicester United. After progressing through the reserve team, Heggs managed to force his way in the first team setup, in which he would go on to spend four seasons with the club. Heggs made 40 appearances and found the net on three occasions for the Baggies. =Bristol Rovers= After losing his place in the first team, Heggs was seeking a return to regular first team football and joined Bristol Rovers for the later part of the 1995 season.

He scored on his debut against Morecambe, but after that found goals hard to come by scoring only five in his 49 games for the club. The undoubted highlight of Heggs' spell at Rushden was scoring the opening goal in a 3‚Äì1 FA Cup Third Round Replay defeat to Premiership side Leeds United at Elland Road.Carl Heggs' Profile on the Official Rushden & Diamonds Website =Chester City= Heggs was unusually loaned from a non-League club to a Football League club when he joined Chester City in March 2000, as he teamed up again with Ian Atkins. However, the Blues were in grave danger of losing their league status when Heggs arrived. He quickly struck up an effective partnership with Luke Beckett, which proved particularly successful in a 5‚Äì0 win over Mansfield Town, but it was not enough to avert relegation and Heggs moved on. =Carlisle United= On 28 July 2000, Heggs joined Third Division side Carlisle United on a two-year contract.Heggs joins Carlisle United However, he only spent one season with the club, making 30 appearances and scoring five goals in the process as the side narrowly avoided relegation from Football League under Ian Atkins. =Forest Green Rovers= Heggs signed for Conference National side Forest Green Rovers in 2001 playing under former England international Nigel Spink. He spent a season at the non league side making just under 40 appearances before moving on to Ilkeston Town. =Tamworth= On 1 June 2005, Heggs joined Staffordshire side Tamworth of the Conference National. His time at Tamworth saw him involved in two notable goals.

Heggs is highly regarded as having excellent knowledge of local football players in Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire. After Hinckley United manager Dean Thomas resigned on 10 October 2012 following an early F.A Cup exit and a poor start to the Conference North league campaign, Heggs was put in caretaker charge of the football club alongside Neil Lyne. He also \\"threw his hat into the ring for the manager's position on a permanent basis\\", according to a club statement. On Thursday, 15 November, Heggs was offered the manager's job on a permanent basis until the end of the 2012‚Äì2013 season. Heggs later accepted the offer.

K.; Association, la vie associative and lifelong learning cites Hirst, P. References page 112. Associationalism \\"gives priority to freedom in its scale of values, but it contends that such freedom can only be pursued effectively if individuals join with their fellows\\" The concept of associationalism =Roots= Associationalism is a European political theory, stemming from 19th and early 20th century social and political theorists from the continent. In France, such political thinkers as de Tocqueville, Proudhon, Durkheim, and Duguit. In England, such pluralists as Cole, Figgis, Laski, Barker, and Maitland. The theory provides an alternative to the previously popular doctrines of state-centered and collectivist ideals which had all but dominated twentieth-century politics: Western social democracy and Eastern bloc Marxist‚ÄìLeninism.Kaspersen p. 1 =Alexis de Tocqueville's associationalism= Alexis de Tocqueville's idea of associationalism ‚Äú...stressed volunteerism, community spirit and independent associational life as protections against the domination of society by the state, and indeed as a counterbalance which helped to keep the state accountable and effective‚Äù.Lewis p. 3 In Tocqueville‚Äôs vision then, economic freedom fosters greed, which engenders political apathy, which results in excessive individualism and passive reliance on the state. This political apathy will in turn result in the almost inevitable growth of government if left unchecked by associationalism. Thus, Tocqueville predicted that ‚ÄúIt is easy to see the time coming in which men will be less and less able to produce, by each alone, the commonest bare necessities of life. The tasks of government must therefore perpetually increase, and its efforts to cope with them must spread its net ever wider. The more government takes the place of associations, the more will individuals lose the idea of forming associations and need the government to come to their help. That is a vicious cycle of cause and effect‚Äù.de Tocqueville p. 43 =Expanded definition= Associational democracy is, in essence, both a political structure and system of relations with the goal of easing pluralist social negotiation and priorities.Kaspersen p. 12 It became an important aspect of public policy, countering previous laissez-faire traditions. Critics considered laissez-faire, which essentially equated to liberal individualism, as not conducive to the fostering of upward mobility in society. Associationalism, as opposed to liberal individualism, embodies a deliberate commitment to social cooperation as well as public well- being.Martell p. 16 \\"Association....grew out of a sense of difference; for the middle class, it meant crossing class lines to bring together people of diverse identities and conditions\\".McGerr p. 67 According to David Lewis, during the late 19th and early 20th century the new middle class required ‚Äú...sanctioned private accumulation underwritten by a state which maintained legal order and stability\\"¬∑ As a result, the state needed to become powerful enough to maintain order, but not so strong as to become oppressive; neither laissez-faire nor statist. Finding this balance between transgressing autonomy and dangerous accumulation of power could prove difficult, and associationalism appeared to be a possible solution.Kaspersen p. 17 Associationalism brought together several political ideologies which, until its conception, were frequently at odds: pluralism, socialism, and cooperative mutualism. It provides for a pluralist rather than a statist or constraining collectivist socialism, yet it also provides for a mutualist and cooperative pluralism. This, as opposed to pluralism which reacts so far to statist communitarianism that it slides into an unrestricted competitive asociality.Martell P. 17 The Beginnings of American associationalism =Setting the stage= Urban politics in late 19th century America proved an ideal situation for the emergence of associationalism, ripe with several qualifications discussed by early associationalists. In addition, voter turnout was relatively high, though usually confined to party lines. Despite this fact, the two large national parties at the time (Democrats and Republicans) lacked significant ideological differences on specific issues. Respected members of communities across the country began to propose associationalism as a solution to America's social political problems. Several Protestant ministers such as Lyman Abbot, Washington Gladden, Josiah Strong, and Walter Raushenbusch began to call for a ‚Äúsocial gospel.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe next great principle,‚Äù Rauschenbusch proclaimed in 1896, ‚Äúis association‚Äù.McGerr p. 66 These growing political currents in favor of associationalism perhaps culminated when voters elected William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt, a left statist associationalist who would become president shortly thereafter, in 1900. =Protective legislation= ‚ÄúAssociationalism is fundamentally about collective governance ‚Äì about the legal constitution of groups and bodies politic and the rules and bylaws that regulate the interrelationships of members‚Äù.Novak p. 2 During the early 20th century Congress passed a great deal of ‚Äúprotective legislation,‚Äù which was, in essence, legislated associationalism. Labor received improved work conditions resulting in fewer work-related injuries. Wages were increased while hours were decreased. In addition, probably the most important protective legislation pertained to the legal establishment and organization of large labor unions. On the other side of the coin, employer costs went up resulting in outsourcing and decreased cash flow into such areas as research and development, slowing technological progress. Fewer hours and the fact that labor was more organized (allowing for an increase in strikes and protests) resulted in less production. Finally, such strong government influence over labor could lead to an abuse of power, favoring certain unions. The results of these legislated regulations suggested to critics that associationalism tends to benefit labor (the \\"people‚Äù) directly at the cost of both corporate management and technological progress. Early presidential associationalism =Theodore Roosevelt= Theodore Roosevelt (President 1901-1908) was the first true champion of American associationalism as evidenced by his intervention into the United Mine Workers strike of 1902. For the first time representatives from government, labor, and management met collectively and were able to resolve the conflict. When management was uncooperative, Roosevelt threatened to employ the military on behalf of labor to arrive at a resolution. Instead, a five-member commission was established to communicate with the company management. Also, wages were increased by ten percent and the length of the work day was cut from ten hours to nine, keeping union membership sound. By demonstrating a new role for the state in such conflicts (aside from the previously held military positions) associationalism took root in American society and politics, and there wasn't another major coal strike in the country until the 1920s. =Woodrow Wilson= Woodrow Wilson (President 1913-1920), a regulatory liberal, employed associationalism during World War I to control and regulate capital, ensuring a steady flow of war supplies while minimizing the risk of breaks in manufacturing vital to the war effort. The establishment of such government agencies as the National War Labor Board were instrumental in preventing strikes and ensuring collective bargaining. In addition, Wilson appointed the country's first Secretary of Labor that was pro labor (William B. Wilson). The policies were implemented as America successfully met its goals in wartime production. There were nearly no strikes, many companies saw enormous profits, and the Allies won the war. References =Footnotes= =Bibliography= * de Tocqueville, Alexis. 'Democracy in America. Penguin Press.

The lymph system depends on intrinsic contractions of the smooth muscle cells in the walls of lymph vessels (peristalsis) and the movement of skeletal muscles to propel lymph through the vessels to lymph nodes and then to the lymph ducts which return lymph to the cardiovascular system. Manual lymph drainage uses a specific amount of pressure (less than 9 ounces per square inch or about 4 kPa) and rhythmic circular movements to stimulate lymph flow.Milady's Guide to Lymph Drainage Massage; Ramona Moody French; Delmar/Cengage; 2004 Clinical studies of MLD conclude that further study of the practice is required before recommending it as an effective health treatment. Medical use Studies show mixed results regarding the efficacy of the method in treating lymphedema and further studies are needed. A 2013 systematic review of manual lymphatic drainage with regard to breast cancer related lymphedema found no clear support for the effectiveness of the intervention in either preventing limb edema in at-risk women or treating women for the condition. History Manual lymphatic drainage was pioneered by Danish Drs. Emil Vodder and Estrid Vodder in the 1930s for the treatment of chronic sinusitis and other immune disorders. While working on the French Riviera treating patients with chronic colds, the Vodders noticed these patients had swollen lymph nodes. In 1932, at a time when the lymphatic system was poorly understood, they began to develop light, rhythmic hand movements hoping to promote lymph movement. In 1936, they introduced this technique in Paris, France, and after World War II, they returned to Copenhagen to teach other practitioners to use this therapy.

La Navidad was the first European colony established in the New World during the Age of Discovery, though it was destroyed by the native Ta√≠no people by the following year. Founding Columbus sailed around the island of Hispaniola on Christmas Eve of 1492, during his first voyage. One of his ships, the Santa Mar√≠a, drifted onto a bank and heeled over. After hearing from Guacanagari that there was much gold to be had on the island, Columbus decided that he would leave the crew of his wrecked vessel to make a settlement on the island and gather the promised gold. He ordered the ship dismantled to provide the building materials for a small fortress: \\"I have ordered a tower and fortress to be constructed and, a large cellar, not because I believe there is any necessity on account of [the natives],\\" he noted in his journal. \\"I am certain the people I have with me could subjugate all this island‚Ä¶ as the population are naked and without arms and very cowardly.\\" Columbus called the port Puerto de la Navidad (\\"Christmas Port\\"), the day he landed there. He appointed Diego de Arana, chief constable of the fleet and son of Rodrigo, Pedro Guti√©rrez, butler of the Spanish royal dais, and Rodrigo de Escobedo to govern the fortress of 36 men. They included carpenters, calkers, a physician, a tailor, and a gunner. Additionally, the settlement was supplied with provisions, trading goods, arms and artillery. On Friday, 4 January 1493, Columbus set sail in the Ni√±a in search of the third ship in the fleet, the Pinta. The Pinta was commanded by Mart√≠n Alonzo Pinz√≥n, and had been absent for six weeks. On the night of 21 November, the caravel Pinta had vanished into the darkness off the coast of Cuba, and in his journal Columbus accused Pinz√≥n of deliberately having separated the Pinta from the other ships in order to beat the admiral to the rich sources of gold which Columbus imagined were in the immediate area. Even more disquieting was his fear that Pinz√≥n might break for Spain in the fast-sailing Pinta to be the first to bring news of the discovery to the Catholic Monarchs and to \\"tell them lies\\" about the admiral's conduct of the expedition. On Sunday morning, 6 January 1493, the missing Pinta was spotted approaching from the east, and after a heated argument between the two men, the fleet returned to gather people and supplies for a return voyage. Calamity When Columbus returned to Navidad on 27 Nov 1493, his second voyage from Spain, he \\"found it burned to the ground . . . nobody in the vicinity.\\" In the fields nearby, however, he discovered the \\"bodies of eight Christians.\\" Columbus later discovered that, soon after his departure, his \\"men began to quarrel among themselves, each taking as many women and as much gold as he could.\\" Guti√©rrez and Escobedo left with nine others, along with their women, for the gold mines. However, the \\"lord of the mines\\" turned, killed them and then marched back to Navidad, defended by Arana with ten others, and Guacanagari. Caonabo set fire to houses, forcing Columbus' men into the sea, where eight drowned, and three were killed onshore. Columbus decided to build a settlement farther east in present-day Dominican Republic and named it La Isabela after Queen Isabella I. Attempt at rediscovery After Columbus sailed away a second time, the site apparently was forgotten until a Haitian farmer led Dr. William Hodges to a location in 1977. Hodges, an amateur archaeologist and American medical missionary, received permission from the Haitian government to excavate a tennis-court-size section of the marshland, and he and his helpers found some artifacts of La Navidad. Despite the finds however, no conclusive evidence has been discovered yet to pinpoint the exact location of La Navidad.http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-lost-fort-of- columbus-8026921/ See also *Chiefdoms of Hispaniola  References  Category:Spanish West Indies Category:1490s in the Caribbean Category:1490s in the Spanish West Indies Category:History of the Colony of Santo Domingo Category:History of Haiti Category:Populated places in Haiti Category:Populated places established in the 1490s Category:1492 establishments in North America Category:1493 disestablishments Category:Former Spanish colonies Category:Spanish colonization of the Americas ","title":"La Navidad"},{"id":"7718248","text":"Games People Play is the third studio album by Pink Cream 69.

A committed opponent of World War I, he was detained in 1917 under the Defence of the Realm Act. Wallhead unsuccessfully contested Coventry in the 1918 general election for the Labour Party, to which the ILP was affiliated. He was elected to Manchester City Council in 1919, a position he held for three years. At the 1922 general election, Wallhead gained Merthyr from the Liberals. As the politics of the South Wales coalfield radicalised, this turned into a safe Labour seat, which he was to hold until his death. He was one of only five ILP MPs to retain their seats in the 1931 general election, after Labour withdrew their support, and initially supported their disaffiliation from Labour. However, in September 1933 he resigned from the ILP and rejoined Labour. He died the following year. His daughter Muriel Nichol was also a Labour politician, and served as MP for Bradford North from 1945 to 1950.

In the process, Fleishman earned a reputation not only as one of the pioneers of public relations, but also as an author, educator, humanitarian, and champion of the state of Israel. Early life A native of St. Louis, Missouri, Fleishman was born there on June 16, 1905, and studied at the St. Louis College of Pharmacy, before being inducted into the U.S. Army. As a major in the U.S. Army Air Corps, he spent World War II primarily as a Pentagon-based public information officer. He traveled to war-torn Germany in October 1945. Sent by the American Jewish Congress as a special consultant to the Secretary of Defense, he headed a survey committee that studied the psychological, economic and social needs of displaced people in Germany and Austria. Jewish Community Work In that capacity, he was an early eyewitness to the horrors of the Holocaust, and his research and subsequent report alerted many organizations in the United States to the forgotten people of World War II ‚Äì the displaced Jews. Upon completion of his report, Fleishman made a 60-city U.S. lecture tour, discussing these refugees‚Äô relief and rehabilitation needs. The trip influenced his life as he became deeply involved in various Jewish causes and with minority affairs. A longtime member of the Assembly of the Jewish Agency in Israel, Fleishman made 57 visits to Israel between 1955 and 1997, becoming a personal friend of many of the founders and leaders of the state. After completing his military duty, Fleishman was awarded the Legion of Merit for his services in the rehabilitation of World War II combat casualties and amputees. Among his accomplishments in that role was putting together a widely distributed publication called ‚ÄúComing Home.‚Äù He also received the Americanism Medal from the Veterans of Foreign Wars. Fleishman was a former president of Congregation B'nai Amoona in Creve Coeur, a former president and campaign chairman of the Jewish Federation of St. Louis, and a co-founder of the St. Louis Jewish Light newspaper. Partnership with Hillard Upon his return from Europe in 1946, Fleishman wasted no time in forming his business partnership with Bob Hillard. The two had known each other for more than a decade, dating back to when Fleishman had served as chief deputy to the city‚Äôs circuit clerk, and Hillard was a reporter for the St. Louis Star-Times. Fleishman served as the firm‚Äôs chairman until his retirement in 1975 at the age of 70. In 1996, he and co- founder Hillard received a Lifetime Achievement Award from Inside PR (now known as The Holmes Report). General Semantics In addition to his prominence in the public relations arena, Fleishman gained distinction in the field of General Semantics. He wrote three books on that subject ‚Äì ‚ÄúSense and Nonsense: A Study in Human Communication,‚Äù ‚ÄúTroubled Talk,‚Äù and ‚ÄúDialogue With Street Fighters.‚Äù Each was recognized as Book of the Year by the International Society of General Semantics. He also was the author of numerous articles on public relations and human communication, and lectured extensively throughout the country. Awards and honors Fleishman received numerous awards and recognition over the years. Among them: the Distinguished Service Medal for Civic Achievement by the United States Junior Chamber of Commerce; the Community Service Award and the Humanitarian Award from the St. Louis Human Development Corporation; and the Community Service Award from the American Jewish Committee. Fleishman died in St. Louis in May 2002 at the age of 96.
