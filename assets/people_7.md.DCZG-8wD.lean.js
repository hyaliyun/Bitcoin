Cornish) mining practice, was a mining engineer and mine manager in Australia. History Warren was born in Newton Abbot, England, note: Newton Abbot misspelled and mislocated into Cornwall. and from age thirteen was working in the mining business. He had experience in the east county mines including Dolcoath and Tavistock and later in America. note: Newton Abbot misspelled and mislocated into Cornwall. He was in South Australia by October 1864, when in response to a newspaper advertisement, he succeeded George Vercoe as manager of the Karkarilla mine, Tipara, one of the complex of copper mines at Moonta. :Vercoe would later accuse Warren of incompetence as a mine manager and as a geologist, to which Warren countered just as bluntly. Percy Wells was another trenchant critic. The Karkarilla mine became uneconomic and was taken over by another company in 1867 and renamed Hamley, and Warren, while being retained, was also made responsible for the nearby Paramatta mine, and 1869 the Wheal James mine. He resigned from the Paramatta company on 25 November 1876, and for two and a half years was in charge of the Balade mine, New Caledonia. He returned to South Australia, where he served as manager of the short-lived Bird-in-Hand gold mine near Woodside. That was followed by the Block 10 mine at Broken Hill, which he managed for over ten years. He assisted T. J. Greenway in tackling the \\"sulphide problem\\". :Zinc sulphide, which constituted a fair percentage of the ore body, was much more difficult to reduce to the metal than the oxides and carbonates of silver and lead, which were the initial source of the mines' wealth. Sulphide tailings accumulated in great heaps at the mines, or was simply not brought to the surface. Greenway, engineer for Block 14 and later the Broken Hill South mines, put considerable effort into crushing and concentrating the ore, which could then be more economically shipped to Europe for processing. A strike called by the Amalgamated Miners' Association and other unions in Broken Hill was held ?? ‚Äì November 1892 after the Mineowners' Association cancelled stope workers' contracts and imposed a contract payment system. Warren held fast against the unions by taking on new workers, mostly from Moonta, and still meeting their production targets. In June 1901 Warren resigned from Block 10 after a dispute with assistant manager L. W. Grayson, who also resigned and set up in business as a consulting engineer. A petition signed by most employees of the mine urged Warren to reconsider. He must have relented, as he was reappointed to his old position in July. In 1902 he was both elected president of the Australasian Institute of Mining Engineers and appointed Justice of the Peace. In April he again resigned, after he had been obliged to effect a number of economies, including the termination of many jobs. His replacement was V. F. Stanley-Low. He was for a short time in 1903 manager of the Cobar-Chesney mine, and the Broken Hill Junction Mining Company for about a year 1904‚Äì05. Inventions *Around 1874 Warren and Fred May, chief engineer at Moonta Mines, invented an improved jigging machine (separates heavy crushed ore from the light stuff, using water and a shaking action), which was proven at the Hamley mine and the Lady Alice near Gawler. A copy of the machine, made by James Martin & Co. of Gawler, was sent to the Balade mine, New Caledonia, in 1875. Others to develop jigging machines were Cowlng, Hancock, Petherick. *He invented a vanner or vanning table, of which the Wilfley table is an example *He patented improvements to the magnetic ore separator. Other interests *While in Broken Hill, Warren was founder and president of the local Boys' Brigade. *Also while in Broken Hill, he was active in the Horticultural Society. Recognition *The Warren vanner, which he developed, was named for him. *In 1893 he was presented by the mine's grateful management with a model of the Block 10 surface workings, crafted in silver by J.

The Turkestan Army (), was a Russian army which was a part of the White movement during the Russian Civil War. It operated from January 1919 to February 1920, in the Transcaspian Oblast area.  History  The Turkestan Army was established on January 22, 1919, by order of the Supreme commander of the AFSR, Lieutenant-General Anton Denikin, as an integral part of the Armed Forces of South Russia. The army was formed with the financial and logistical support of the British military mission in Turkestan, under the leadership of Major General Wilfrid Malleson at the counter-revolutionary Transcaspian Government in Ashgabat. When in April‚ÄìJuly 1919, the British troops were withdrawn from Turkestan, the leadership of the Turkestan Army was transferred to the command of the AFSR. On 1 May 1919, the Turkestan Army had some 7,000 infantry and 2,000 cavalry. The Turkestan Army was supported by General Junaid Khan, the dictator of the Khanate of Khiva and a leader of the Basmachi movement who had an army of some 12,000 soldiers. At the suggestion of the headquarters of the AFSR, the Turkestan Army was to march from the district of Krasnovodsk to Tashkent and Verniy (now Alma-Ata), to link up with the Basmachi Forces. However, in May‚ÄìJuly 1919 the Red Transcaspian Front of the Turkestan SFR, warned for this attack, advanced and took on May 21 Ba√Ωramaly, on May 23 Merv, on May 24 Serhetabat, on July 7 Tejen, and on July 9 the capital Ashgabat. The Turkestan Army was thrown back to the Caspian Sea and on October 19, 1919 suffered another severe defeat at the Aydyn station (1000 soldiers surrendered into captivity). The Turkestan army was again seriously defeated in the district of Kazan-Jika on December 2‚Äì7, 1919. The change of the commander of the Turkestan Army between July and October has not brought the desired success. The defeats followed one after the other. Finally, by the beginning of 1920 the Army was reduced to a small group, encircled in the area of Krasnovodsk. On February 6, 1920, the remnants of the Turkestan Army were evacuated from Krasnovodsk to Dagestan on the ships of the Caspian Flotilla of the AFSR, and the city was occupied by the Red Army. A small part of the Army was transported to Persia (Iran) by British ships. The Turkestan Army had ceased to exist and was dissolved.

Plot  The narrator, Florent-Claude Labrouste, is a depressed agricultural scientist who lives in a Parisian apartment block, the Tour Totem. He commutes to Normandy to help promote French cheese. Sympathetic to the plight of local farmers, he is powerless to help them retain their traditional methods: After watching a television documentary about people who choose to disappear from their life without telling anyone, Labrouste abruptly leaves his girlfriend, a young Japanese woman who is sexually hyperactive but devoid of affection, quits his job under a false pretence and flees to a chain hotel in another part of Paris. A doctor prescribes him an antidepressant to remedy his low levels of serotonin, hence the title of the novel. Although the drug dulls his sex drive, Labrouste returns to Normandy in search of former lovers. While there, he visits an old college friend, Aymeric, a divorced and suicidal aristocratic landowner. At the climax of the novel, farmers equipped with assault rifles blockade a motorway. Aymeric is among them and shoots himself, sparking a clash with riot police in which 10 more people die. Later on, Labrouste begins secretly observing the love of his life, Camille, who has a son from another man. Initially intent on killing the child with one of Aymeric's sniper rifles in order to win back her love, he finds himself unable to go through with it. Finally, Labrouste moves back to Paris, contemplating committing suicide by jumping out of a window.  Themes  The novel depicts French farmers struggling to survive in the face of globalisation, agribusiness and European Union policies. It foresaw many concerns of the yellow vests movement which began protesting in France in late 2018. Written before protesters began blockading roads in real life, Serotonin soon joined previous Houellebecq novels Platform and Submission in being termed eerily prophetic by critics. As with many of Houllebecq's works, the protagonist is an alienated, middle-aged man. Serotonin features its author's trademark black humour and depictions of loveless sex, but also touches on paedophilia (when the narrator spies on a German tourist) and bestiality (when he finds pornographic videos of his girlfriend on her computer). The overall mood is one of spiritual malaise and social fracture during the decline of the West.  Publication  The initial print run in France was 320,000 copies. German, Italian and Spanish editions were published the same month. An English translation by Shaun Whiteside was published in the United Kingdom by William Heinemann on 26 September 2019. Whiteside's translation was later published in the United States by Farrar, Straus and Giroux on 19 November 2019.  Reception  In France, Serotonin was the best-selling fiction book in the week it was released. Within three days of its publication, it had sold 90,000 copies. The release was considered a national event, coming as it did the same month Houellebecq was awarded the Legion of Honour. In response to the narrator of Serotonin calling Niort \\"one of the ugliest towns I've ever seen\\", the town's mayor said that he would send some locally grown angelica to Houellebecq's publisher to cheer up the notoriously gloomy author.

Lahu Ka Lagaan translates to 'the tax on blood' from Hindi. The campaign was launched in April 2017, following the release of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) rates being rolled out by the Indian government, that placed sanitary napkins at the second lowest tax slab of 12%. The campaign received widespread attention, when celebrities like Mallika Dua, Cyrus Broacha, Vishal Dadlani and Aditi Rao Hydari used their social media influence to voice their support for the campaign, and asked the Indian finance minister Arun Jaitley to make sanitary napkins to be made tax-free. The primary objective of the campaign, besides the tax exemption on sanitary napkins, was to ensure the implementation of governmental schemes of providing low-cost pads and vending machines for the dispensation of sanitary pads, affecting girls' access to education and livelihoods.  Context  The context of the campaign lays in the unavailability and lack of affordability of sanitary napkins in India. India has roughly 355 people(girls/women) who menstruate. Out of these, almost 70% cannot afford sanitary napkins. The lack of affordable sanitary napkins, and the subsequent use of unhygienic alternatives like dirty fabric, sand, wood shavings or dry leaves, increases women's vulnerability to reproductive tract infections by 70%. In response to the widespread criticism against the tax, the government declared sanitary napkins tax-exempt on July 22nd 2018, a move that was hailed as a victory for the Lahu Ka Lagaan campaign. However, some financial experts opined that the cutting 12% GST on sanitary napkins might actually make them more costly, as manufacturers would still have to pay individual tax on the raw materials needed for production, thus driving up prices.

Haaziq is one of the youngest presenters at TEDx at multiple occasions. He was widely covered by media for being young innovator and titled a 'child prodigy' by many. ERVIS is the creation of Haaziq which is a large vessel in the ocean with multiple saucers attached to it. ERVIS could help suck wastes out the surface of oceans. He has also interacted with press and media to raise awareness on the plastic problem and how it is affecting marine life.  Background  Haaziq as a student of Grade VIII (2019), in Indus International School Pune; as part of project had created a prototype of a ship called ERVIS which is an alias assigned to the large ship to clean ocean of waste materials as part of cleaning the nature. He presented at TED ED weekend in New York in June 2017 where he did his first international Talk. Subsequently, he has spoken at TedxGateway in Mumbai on his journey of ERVIS and the peril of plastic pollution.  Project ERVIS  As Haaziq describes, \\"the ship is essentially a large boat powered by hydrogen and renewable natural gas with various compartments and saucers surrounding it\\". The saucers, float on the surface gravitate to create a whirlpool to pull the waste towards its center. These saucers will have a central outlet which will swallow the waste and is connected via a tube to various chambers in the ship. These chambers include an oil chamber which collects waste oil.

This essay is considered to be Manilal's most important work. With its publication, Manilal became one of the major Indian social thinkers of his time. It remains central to Manilal's ideas on social reform. All his other writings on the women's questions and the social reform movement use this text as a referent Manilal, in his discussion of the place of women in Hindu tradition, adhered to the traditional view in some regards, and opposed widow marriages. This position generated considerable controversy. Background upright=0.9 Manilal had joined the Gujarati Social Union, a club for Gujarati graduates in Bombay, in 1882. Shortly after, during a meeting of the Union, the topic of widow remarriage was debated for an hour. The consensus of members was in favour of allowing widow remarriage, given their high level of education. However, Manilal voiced his disagreement. He analysed the subject in the light of the Hindu view of life in detail and argued with close logic against permitting widow remarriage. The topic was discussed at length in a series of debates over the next month. These proved inconclusive, since no consensus over the issue emerged. Manilal noted in his diary that two people were won over to his point of view during this period. It was this extended debate which spurred him to examine various aspects of widow remarriage. The result of his meditations was encapsulated in his lengthy article Nari Pratishtha, which was not immediately published. In 1884 Manilal was still resident in Bombay and was spurred to publish the essay after he came across and studied a copy of Auguste Comte's System of Positive Polity. In this work he found ideas similar to his own regarding women, and having absorbed Comte's views on the nature and role of women, he published his essay in the weekly magazine Gujarati the same year, in eight installments. With the addition of a further section written shortly afterwards, this was issued in book form in October 1885. In this Manilal stated that it was written while his attitude was influenced by Auguste Comte's positivism and Tennyson's Princess. The essay was later published in the collection Manilal Na Tran Lekho (English: Manlial's Three Articles), edited by Dhirubhai Thaker and published by Gujarat Vidhya Sabha in 1954. Summary The essay deals with the status of woman in Hindu tradition. The author deployed a number of stylistic techniques including rhetoric and polemic to reinforce his arguments. Manilal's thoughts on woman, marriage and family, as laid down in Nari Pratistha, can be summarised as: * Men and women are two parts of an integral whole. Woman represents the left half, which according to Hindu scriptures is tender and weak. They are neither superior nor inferior, just different. * Men and women should have separate spheres of work. This is because women have menstrual cycles. Employment outside the home should therefore be left to men. This is necessary in order to protect the purity of women. * Women are more capable of love, affection and of being dutiful; three elements which Manilal deemed indispensable at a religious level if one is to achieve a sense of unity with the Supreme Being (Adwaita). *Love is possible only between the opposite sexes because a woman will never compete with a man. A man should teach simple ethics to his woman. *Women's education should focus on training them in love and duty. However, this orientation should not exclude them from also being taught languages, mathematics, science, history and similar topics, which ought to be objects of study for women. At the same time Manilal held that contemporary education was counterproductive because it did not respect caste differences and taught women English as well as a variety of social graces he considered to be superficial. *At the time of marriage a woman should be 16 years old and a man 25 years old. *A couple joined in love is undivided by death. With this premise, Manilal had to conclude that widow remarriage was sinful. Ideally, even a man should not remarry, but given women's superior capacity for love and affection, the obligation on them not to remarry was obligatory. Reception and criticism Manilal's response to the critical review of Nari Pratishtha written by an anonymous author Nari Pratishtha is considered by critics to be Manilal's major work, and it made him one of the major social thinkers of his time. Nari Pratishtha remains central to Manilal's ideas on social reform. All his other writings on the women's questions and the social reform movement use this text as a referent. After its 1885 publication, a critical review of Nari Pratishtha appeared in the January‚ÄìMarch, 1887 issue of the Gujarati language magazine Buddhiprakash. The anonymous reviewer criticized Manilal, mainly on two grounds: firstly, that it is not sinful to remarry; and secondly, that the argument that love forecloses the possibility of remarriage is invalid. Manilal responded to this criticism in the first issue of Bharatibhushan, a magazine edited by Balashankar Kantharia, writing that he had not suggested that widow remarriage is \\"sinful\\". He had, he claimed, suggested that a woman who is bound by love could find the idea of remarriage 'sin-like'. Explaining the difference between the two, he argued that those who are not bound by love may not find the idea of remarriage 'sin- like'. He stated that his tract was written for people who wished to understand the true meaning of marriage. Those who did not wish to do so, may well marry again. He had no objection to their doing so.

Reviewing the research on teaching economics in (mainly U.S.) colleges written until the late 1970s with Rendigs Fels, he surveys the measurement of inputs and outputs in economics education, the impacts of human capital, the college environment and of alternative teaching methods on economics education, and the long-term effects of economic education on students. Siegfried and Fels conclude that \\"different students learn economics in different ways\\" and that thus \\"the best teaching strategy provides alternative learning methods directed towards the different needs of different student\\". They find positive impacts for computer-study-management programmes (including frequent testing and adapted assignments) and programmed learning, but are less positive about the use of self-paced instruction and computerized games in economic education, and argue that graduate students are generally as good teachers as regular faculty, but would benefit from teacher training.Siegfried, J.J., Fels, R. (1979). Research on teaching college economics: A survey. Journal of Economic Literature, 17(3), pp. 923-969. In a survey of the scant research on male-female differences in economic education produced until 1979, Siegfried finds few differences between genders in terms of learning and understanding of economics at the elementary school level, though gaps appear to develop in high school and persist through the college years without further widening.Siegfried, J.J. (1979). Male-female differences in economic education: A survey. Journal of Economic Education, 10(2), pp. 1-11. In the early 1990s, together with other economic educators such as Deirdre McCloskey, Siegfried made the case for reforming economics majors, which they suggested to consist of (i) a strong introductory sequence oriented towards application, (ii) rigorous intermediate theory courses involving economic analysis, (iii) background courses in mathematics and quantitative methods, (iv) at least five electives, and (v) a capstone experience (e.g. a thesis).Siegfried, J.J. et al. (1991). The status and prospects of the economics major. Journal of Economic Education, 22(3), pp. 197-224. Moreover, in the late 1990s, Siegfried and Michael Salemi called on universities, among else, to offer economics as part of general education, to revise economics curricula to foster students' proficiency in economics (more particularly, the \\"Hansen proficiencies\\") by applying economics in the classroom, and to teach economic faculty teaching methods besides lecturing.Salemi, M.K., Siegfried, J.J. (1999). The state of economic education. Papers and Proceedings of the American Economic Association', 89(2), pp. 355-361. More recently, Siegfried, Allen Sanderson and Peter McHenry have criticized the quality of economic impact studies of colleges and universities, arguing that they often overestimate local returns on investment due to inadequate counterfactuals and pointing to the definitions of the \\"local\\" area and \\"new\\" expenditures, the double-counting of economic impacts, problems with local taxes and the omission of local spillovers through increased human capital as common problems in such studies.Siegfried, J.J., Sanderson, A.R., McHenry, P.

(describe position, biodiversity and endemism of the region) The MPA is in the warm temperate Natal inshore marine bioregion to the north-east of the Mbashe River. Four major habitats exist in the sea in this region, distinguished by the nature of the substrate. The substrate, or base material, is important in that it provides a base to which an organism can anchor itself, which is vitally important for those organisms which need to stay in one particular kind of place. Rocky shores and reefs provide a firm fixed substrate for the attachment of plants and animals. Sandy beaches and bottoms are a relatively unstable substrate and cannot anchor many of the other benthic organisms. Finally there is open water, above the substrate and clear of the kelp forest, where the organisms must drift or swim. Mixed habitats are also frequently found, which are a combination of those mentioned above. There are no significant estuarine habitats in the MPA. Rocky shores and reefs There are rocky reefs and mixed rocky and sandy bottoms. For many marine organisms the substrate is another type of marine organism, and it is common for several layers to co-exist. Examples of this are red bait pods, which are usually encrusted with sponges, ascidians, bryozoans, anemones, and gastropods, and abalone, which are usually covered by similar seaweeds to those found on the surrounding rocks, usually with a variety of other organisms living on the seaweeds. The type of rock of the reef is of some importance, as it influences the range of possibilities for the local topography, which in turn influences the range of habitats provided, and therefore the diversity of inhabitants. Sandstone and other sedimentary rocks erode and weather very differently, and depending on the direction of dip and strike, and steepness of the dip, may produce reefs which are relatively flat to very high profile and full of small crevices. These features may be at varying angles to the shoreline and wave fronts. There are fewer large holes, tunnels and crevices in sandstone reefs, but often many deep but low near-horizontal crevices. Coral reefs Sedimentary beaches and bottoms (including mud, sand, shelly, pebble and gravel bottoms) Sedimentary bottoms at first glance appear to be fairly barren areas, as they lack the stability to support many of the spectacular reef based species, and the variety of large organisms is relatively low. The sediment is continually being moved around by wave action, to a greater or lesser degree depending on weather conditions and exposure of the area. This means that sessile organisms must be specifically adapted to areas of relatively loose substrate to thrive in them, and the variety of species found on a sandy or gravel bottom will depend on all these factors. unconsolidated sedimentary bottoms have one important compensation for their instability, animals can burrow into the sediment and move up and down within its layers, which can provide feeding opportunities and protection from predation. Other species can dig themselves holes in which to shelter, or may feed by filtering water drawn through the tunnel, or by extending body parts adapted to this function into the water above the sand.

It is about 29 km south-east of Gordon's Bay and approximately 37 km north-west of Hermanus on the south-western coast of the Western Cape. It is in the Atlantic Ocean immediately adjacent to the town of Betty's Bay, in the Overstrand Municipal area. It is one of the smaller MPAs with only 20.14 km2 area., but includes the Stony Point African penguin colony, which is a tourist attraction. Shore angling is allowed subject to permit conditions, but not boat fishing History The MPA was proclaimed by the Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism, Mohammed Valli Moosa, in Government Gazette No. 21948 of 29 December 2000 in terms section 43 of the Marine Natural Resources Act, 18 of 1998. It was previously known as the H. F. Verwoerd Marine Reserve, established in 1981. Purpose A marine protected area is defined by the IUCN as \\"A clearly defined geographical space, recognised, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values\\". Extent The MPA extends 3 km along the coastline and includes the inshore marine environment the western beacon on a rocky promontory at Stony Point and the eastern beacon just to the east of Jock's Bay, and extending two nautical miles seawards from the high-water mark.

Use =Activities requiring a permit= Fishing All marine organisms are protected in the MPA, and no fishing is allowed, with the exception of shore angling (subject to valid permits). This includes shore angling competitions which are held on a regular basis. Geography =General topography= =Geology= =Hydrography= =Bathymetry= =Climate of the South-western Cape= The climate of the South-western Cape is markedly different from the rest of South Africa, which is a summer rainfall region, receiving most of its rainfall during the summer months of December to February. The South-western Cape has a Mediterranean type climate, with most of its rainfall during the winter months from June to September. During the summer the dominant factor determining the weather in the region is a high pressure zone, known as the South Atlantic High, located over the South Atlantic ocean to the west of the Cape coast. Winds circulating in an anticlockwise direction from such a system reach the Cape from the south-east, producing periods of up to several days of high winds and mostly clear skies. These winds keep the region relatively cool. Because of its south facing aspect Betty's Bay is exposed to these winds. Winter in the South- western Cape is characterised by disturbances in the circumpolar westerly winds, resulting in a series of eastward moving depressions. These bring cool cloudy weather and rain from the north west. The south westerly winds over the South Atlantic produce the prevailing south-westerly swell typical of the winter months, which beat on the exposed coastline. =Sea conditions= Ecology Marine ecoregions of the South African Exclusive Economic Zone: Betty's Bay Marine protected Area is in the Agulhas inshore ecoregion. The MPA is in the warm temperate Agulhas ecoregion to the east of Cape Point which extends eastwards to the Mbashe River. There are a large proportion of species endemic to South Africa along this coastline. Four major habitats exist in the sea in this region, distinguished by the nature of the substrate. The substrate, or base material, is important in that it provides a base to which an organism can anchor itself, which is vitally important for those organisms which need to stay in one particular kind of place. Rocky shores and reefs provide a firm fixed substrate for the attachment of plants and animals. Some of these may have Kelp forests, which reduce the effect of waves and provide food and shelter for an extended range of organisms. Sandy beaches and bottoms are a relatively unstable substrate and cannot anchor kelp or many of the other benthic organisms. Finally there is open water, above the substrate and clear of the kelp forest, where the organisms must drift or swim. Mixed habitats are also frequently found, which are a combination of those mentioned above. There are no significant estuarine habitats in the MPA. Rocky shores and reefs There are rocky reefs and mixed rocky and sandy bottoms. For many marine organisms the substrate is another type of marine organism, and it is common for several layers to co-exist. Examples of this are red bait pods, which are usually encrusted with sponges, ascidians, bryozoans, anemones, and gastropods, and abalone, which are usually covered by similar seaweeds to those found on the surrounding rocks, usually with a variety of other organisms living on the seaweeds. The type of rock of the reef is of some importance, as it influences the range of possibilities for the local topography, which in turn influences the range of habitats provided, and therefore the diversity of inhabitants. Sandstone and other sedimentary rocks erode and weather very differently, and depending on the direction of dip and strike, and steepness of the dip, may produce reefs which are relatively flat to very high profile and full of small crevices. These features may be at varying angles to the shoreline and wave fronts. There are fewer large holes, tunnels and crevices in sandstone reefs, but often many deep but low near- horizontal crevices. Kelp forests Kelp forests are a variation of rocky reefs, as the kelp requires a fairly strong and stable substrate which can withstand the loads of repeated waves dragging on the kelp plants. The Sea bamboo Ecklonia maxima grows in water which is shallow enough to allow it to reach to the surface with its gas-filled stipes, so that the fronds form a dense layer at or just below the surface, depending on the tide. The shorter Split-fan kelp Laminaria pallida grows mostly on deeper reefs, where there is not so much competition from the sea bamboo. Both these kelp species provide food and shelter for a variety of other organisms, particularly the Sea bamboo, which is a base for a wide range of epiphytes, which in turn provide food and shelter for more organisms. Sandy beaches and bottoms (including shelly, pebble and gravel bottoms) Sandy bottoms at first glance appear to be fairly barren areas, as they lack the stability to support many of the spectacular reef based species, and the variety of large organisms is relatively low. The sand is continually being moved around by wave action, to a greater or lesser degree depending on weather conditions and exposure of the area. This means that sessile organisms must be specifically adapted to areas of relatively loose substrate to thrive in them, and the variety of species found on a sandy or gravel bottom will depend on all these factors. Sandy bottoms have one important compensation for their instability, animals can burrow into the sand and move up and down within its layers, which can provide feeding opportunities and protection from predation. Other species can dig themselves holes in which to shelter, or may feed by filtering water drawn through the tunnel, or by extending body parts adapted to this function into the water above the sand.

There are a large proportion of species endemic to South Africa along this coastline. Alien invasive species Threats Poaching of abalone Haliotis midae by local and out-of-town poachers is a significant problem.

First Aid Nursing Yeomanry During the First World War she joined the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry and served in France.Malcolm Page, King's African Rifles: A History, Pen and Sword, 30 Mar 2011, p.59 In 1932, she established the Kenyan branch of the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry. Their role expanded as result of the Second World War, and their name changed to the Women's Territorial Service. Farrar travelled to South Africa and Rhodesia to recruit drivers, and by the end of 1940 the Kenya FANYs had approximately 700-800 members. Initially they were housed in various commandeered houses in Nairobi and ran a despatch rider service between Nairobi and the King's African Rifles camps in Garissa. They also staffed the ambulances for casualties from Ethiopia. As the war progressed their role changed, and they took on additional duties such as catering and intelligence work, both in East Africa and abroad, including Cairo, Somalia, Madagascar and Malaya. Farrar gained the rank of Major and was made an MBE for her war services in 1941. The FANYs were disbanded at the end of the war. Politics In 1937 she became the first woman elected to the Legislative Council of Kenya when she defeated Conway Harvey by just two votes. She held the seat of Nyanza until 1942. Sidney was also a prominent member of the East Africa Women‚Äôs League and served as its president between 1953-4. During her presidency the EAWL was asked to take a census on the need for Primary day schools in rural areas and as a result of this several schools were opened.

Unlike other natural rubbers, this material was thermoplastic allowing it to be easily moulded. Nothing else like it was available to manufacturing until well into the twentieth century when synthetic plastics were developed.Ash, p. 29 Gutta-percha proved to be an ideal insulator for submarine telegraph cables. The company started making this type of cable in 1848 and it rapidly became their main product, on which it had a near monopoly. The world's first international telegraph connection under the sea, a link from Dover to Calais in 1851, used a cable made by the company. Except for a few early ones, submarine cables were armoured with iron, then later steel, wires.Bright, p. 11 The Gutta Percha Company made only the insulated cores, not the complete cable, until 1864 when it merged in to the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company.  Gutta-percha  Gutta-percha harvesting on Sarawak Gutta-percha is a natural rubber that has the unusual property (for 19th- century materials) of being thermoplastic. It can be moulded after placing in hot water and will reharden when cool. It was brought to attention in Europe by William Montgomerie, a Scottish surgeon of the East India Company in Singapore where the trees from which the material is obtained are native. Montgomerie sent samples to the Society of Arts in London in 1843 with the idea that the material could be used for medical apparatus. In 1844, Montgomerie left samples with Charles Mackintosh's raincoat company. A partner in the company, Thomas Hancock, passed samples to his brother Charles who was trying to invent a new bottle stopper made from cemented ground cork. Hancock then abandoned his original idea and took out a patent for bottle stoppers made from gutta-percha.Haigh, p. 26  Company history  The company was formed on 4 February 1845 by partners Charles Hancock and Henry Bewley, a Dublin chemist making soda water, initially to make Hancock's bottle stoppers.Haigh, p. 26 Their premises were at Wharf Road, Islington, London.Scott The range of products was soon greatly expanded, and included machine belts, shoe soles, and toys. However, one of their most important products was gutta-percha insulated electrical cable.Haigh, p. 26 Bewley was also a lead pipe maker. He had designed a machine for extruding lead pipes and on the formation of the Gutta Percha Company, he used this machine for extruding gutta-percha tubing. The company did not at first use this machine for insulating electrical cable. The method initially used was to apply strips of gutta-percha to copper wire. The resulting seam in the insulation was to prove problematic for underwater cables as it provided a route for the ingress of water.Bright, pp. 250, 301 = Submarine cables = Gutta-percha made possible practical submarine telegraph cables because it was both waterproof and resistant to seawater as well as being thermoplastic. Gutta-percha's use as an electrical insulator was first suggested by Michael Faraday after he tested a sample.Haigh, p. 26 Many possible insulation schemes for a submarine cable, such as hemp impregnated with tar, were tested by Charles Wheatstone who had suggested a cable between England and France as early as 1840. None of these schemes were successful. Wheatstone had looked at gutta-percha but could not find a good way of applying it to the conductor.Bright, pp. 2‚Äì4 Reels of gutta-percha insulated cable being loaded at the Greenwich works shortly after the merger into the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company On hearing of this possible application for gutta-percha, Hancock designed a machine for applying it to a conductor seamlessly. Hancock's machine was an adaptation of Bewley's tube extruding machine. However, Hancock denied Bewley the right to use the machine. The dispute resulted in Hancock leaving and setting up the rival West Ham Gutta Percha Company. Hancock lost the dispute in court and his company went bankrupt.Haigh, p.26 The first order for gutta-percha electrical cable came in 1848 from the South Eastern Railway for a length for experiment. South Eastern Railway, in collaboration with the Submarine Telegraph Company, wished to extend their telegraph line through to France. The cable was successfully tested off Folkestone from the ship Princess Clementine with messages sent through the cable to London. The railway afterwards used the cable in a wet railway tunnel.Haigh, pp. 26‚Äì27 This trial was followed in 1849 by an order for of cable from the Submarine Telegraph Company to lay a cable from Dover to Calais. This cable, laid in 1850, soon failed, largely because the Submarine Telegraph Company failed to have it armoured. Undeterred, the company placed a new order in 1850, but this time the cable was to be sent to a wire rope manufacturer for armouring before laying. This order was four timesScott as large as the 1849 order since the new cable was to have four gutta-percha insulated cores. This cable was a success, and became the first working oceanic submarine cable.Haigh, pp. 27, 192 Although the Gutta Percha Company were the first to make a cable for crossing an ocean, they were not the first to make a gutta-percha insulated underwater cable. Faraday published his suggestion in 1848, but had previously privately recommended gutta-percha to William Siemens of Siemens Brothers who passed the information to his brother Werner von Siemens.Haigh, p. 26 In 1847 Werner invented a machine, described as like a macaroni machine, for applying gutta-percha to a conductor seamlessly.Bright, pp. 249‚Äì250 His company, Siemens & Halske, then laid underground gutta-percha cables extensively around Germany, including one that crossed the Rhine in 1849.Bright, p. 251 However, the Gutta Percha Company were the first to make a cable that crossed an ocean.Bright, pp. 251‚Äì252 The Gutta Percha Company does not appear to have had any intellectual property issues with Siemens. This was because Siemens' work was largely for military purposes and consequently nothing was patented initially. Siemens even obtained the gutta-percha from the Gutta Percha Company. The cables were not just for military communications, one 1848 cable in Kiel harbour had the overtly military purpose of setting off mines.Bright, p. 251 Gutta-percha insulated core rapidly became the chief product of the company.Haigh, p. 27 In 1851‚Äì1852 they produced of it. The company had a monopoly on this product, and the cores for nearly all submarine cables made before 1865 were made by them. The Gutta Percha Company never made finished cables; they supplied the cores and other companies, mostly wire rope manufacturers, laid them into the steel armouring to make complete cables. In April 1864, the Gutta Percha Company merged with Glass, Elliot and Company, one of these wire rope makers, to form the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company who could supply completed cables and provide maintenance for them.Haigh, p. 27 The merger was at the instigation of John Pender who became chairman of the company. Pender's motivation in this was that the new company should make the first successful transatlantic telegraph cable for the Atlantic Telegraph Company.Huurdeman, pp. 132, 136  Gutta-percha quality  The quality of gutta-percha, as supplied by the Gutta Percha Company,Bright, p. 156 was extensively discussed by Charles Tilston Bright in his book Submarine Telegraphs.Bright, pp. 263‚Äì269 Bright was the chief electrician (chief engineer) of the Magnetic Telegraph Company, a major customer of the Gutta Percha Company,Fari, p. 109 and later electrician-in-chief of the transatlantic telegraph cable project of the Atlantic Telegraph Company, also using the Gutta Percha Company's product.Hearn, p. 81 Gutta-percha from different regions contains different amounts of resin, resulting in variations in quality. For electrical cables, the resin content needs to be minimal. The best gutta-percha came from Java and Makassar, the worst came from Borneo.Bright, p. 265 The factory purification process could also make a difference. A good commercial gutta- percha would have around 80% gutta and 15% or less of resin.Bright, p. 263 Water content has no appreciable effect on the electrical resistance of the material until the content reaches a threshold of around 2‚Äì3%.Bright, p. 267 Highly purified gutta-percha is almost entirely resistant to chemical attack and ingress of water. However, obtaining this level of purity was not economical for submarine cables. Impure gutta-percha oxidises and becomes brittle. The rate of deterioration is very slow for cable permanently in the water, but cable crossing the landing zone is exposed to frequent changes in temperature and cycles of exposure and submerging. This environment could cause the insulation to crumble and expose the conductor.Bright, p. 262 For this reason, these sections of cable were protected with an additional layer of another material such as India rubber.Bright, pp. 265‚Äì266 Additives to the gutta-percha could greatly affect quality. The material supplied for the Siemens cables by the Gutta Percha Company had a high sulphur content. This, together with poor joints and poor manufacturing by Siemens, caused many of the early Siemens cables to quickly fail.Bright, p. 250  See also  * Willoughby Smith  References   Bibliography  * Ash, Stewart, \\"The development of submarine cables\\", ch. 1 in, Burnett, Douglas R.

The three were all made missionaries in 1704 in Rome before setting off for Cairo to begin their travel through the Nile River to reach Ethiopia. But the team experienced significant pitfalls: conflicts in Ethiopia slowed them down and forced their return to Cairo though the team succeeded in their second attempt to reach their destination. Finally, anti-religious sentiment started fermenting there under the new monarch who decreed missionaries to be nothing more than heretics, which resulted in the three friars being stoned. The beatification process for the three slain friars launched in 1932 over two centuries following their deaths; the trio were beatified in Rome on 20 November 1988 upon confirmation that the trio died \\"in odium fidei\\" (in hatred of the faith). Life =Johannes Laurentius Weiss= Johannes Laurentius Weiss was born in Konnersreuth in Bavaria in 1675 as the second of six children. He was educated in a Cistercian convent in the Upper Palatinate. He entered the Order of Friars Minor at their convent in Graz in Austria on 13 October 1693 and upon his admittance into the order he assumed the name \\"Liberat\\". He received his sacerdotal ordination to the priesthood in Vienna on 14 September 1699 from the Cardinal Archbishop of Esztergom Leopold Karl von Kollonitsch. Following his ordination he worked in Langenlois and then in Graz. In 1703 he offered himself to go to the missions but had to undergo training first in order to fulfil this request. Propaganda Fide in Rome named him as such on 4 April 1704 after he underwent a training course for five months in Rome and departed on 1 January 1705 for Cairo to join the group that would go to Ethiopia. He left Cairo along the Nile River on 14 January 1705 - with seven companions that Father Giuseppe da Gerusalemme was leading - in order to go to Ethiopia to begin their mission. In June the team arrived in Debba in Sudan but were unable to continue due to tensions and so on 21 August took refuge in Allefun. The team remained there until being called to Sennar on 31 March 1708 but over time some of the members died or returned home which left Weiss alone with Giuseppe and with Michele Pio Fasoli. But there was a setback upon Giuseppe's death in May 1709 which later forced Weiss and Fasoli to return to Cairo on 30 June 1710. On 20 April 1711 the officials of Propaganda Fide in Rome asked the two to attempt to travel to Ethiopia once more prompting their departure on 3 November 1711 alongside Antonio Francesco Marzorati; the trio arrived in Gondar on 20 July 1912 to have the emperor Yostos receive them. =Michele Pio Fasoli= Michele Pio Fasoli was born in Zerbo in Pavia in 1676. He entered the Order of Friars Minor in Lugano in Switzerland on 5 March 1792 and upon his admittance selected the name \\"Samuele\\". Propaganda Fide recognized him on 21 January 1704 to be one of their missionaries after he completed a training course to prepare him for his future work. =Antonio Francesco Marzorati= Antonio Francesco Marzorati was born in Varese on 10 September 1670. He arrived first in Cairo on 10 September 1701 after completing a course to prepare him for his work in the foreign missions. Deaths The emperor Dawit III (r. 1716-21) claimed that missionaries were heretics and ordered their immediate persecution; he did not agree with the policies of his predecessor Yostos (r. 1711-16) who allowed missionaries to teach and operate in a small hospital even though he forbade them to preach. The three were arrested on 2 March 1716 and were pressured to renounce their faith; the trio refused and were stoned to death on 3 March in public as a result. Beatification The beatification process opened under the Cardinal Archbishop of Vienna Theodor Innitzer in November 1932 and who closed the process in March 1943. The official Positio dossier was submitted to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in Rome in 1984 with historians approving the cause on 16 May 1984 after having assessed the circumstances of their deaths in light of the historical context. Theologians also approved the cause on 15 December 1987 as did the C.C.S. members on 1 March 1988. The trio were approved for beatification on 28 March 1988 after Pope John Paul II confirmed the three friars were killed \\"in odium fidei\\" (in hatred of the faith) and beatified the missionaries on 20 November 1988 in Saint Peter's Basilica. The current postulator for this cause is the Franciscan priest Giovangiuseppe Califano.

It was the only combined library and club in Sydney and, in 1936, was the first business to sign up as an occupant of the newly completed heritage listed City Mutual Life Assurance Building. Library and club Assisted by friends, Hill covered 200 books before opening her library to members. She later expanded the library to increase the collection and include facilities provided by a private club, including a ball room and a restaurant. During the day, members would visit to have lunch, read or play cards. In the evening it became a venue for balls, receptions, private parties, social events and at least one wedding ceremony. In its years of operation, over 5,000 wedding receptions took place at the Pickwick Book Club. Dorise Hill Hill was the eldest daughter of Mr Roland Hill and Caroline Mary Hill ( - 25 January 1942) who had three daughters and two sons. She was a business woman, avid reader and involved in the performing arts. She established the library to meet a need she perceived within the community. Hill was a foundation member of the Independent Theatre and between 1931 - 1932, the Pickwick Book Club further expanded with the establishment of the Pickwick Theatre Group by Hill and Phillip Lewis. The group put on numerous productions at the Savoy Theatre during 1930 - 1931 and continued to put on small productions on the tiny stage in the ballroom in the club. She was regular contributor to the Truth writing book reviews in a column called \\"Books Worth Reading\\". Following Hill's marriage to Dr. Michael Neylon ( - 1949) in July 1947, her brother-in-law Robert Milne Stephen ( - 1965), who became known as Mr Pickwick, took over the management of business. At her death in 1953, Hill left the Pickwick Book Club to her sister Dulcie May Stephen. The club continued to operate until September 1969. At the time of its closure, the club had 900 members. Despite the end of the Pickwick Book Club, the venue remained available as a venue for wedding receptions and evening parties. Locations Initially situated in Her Majesty's Theatre in Pitt Street, the club relocated to larger premises in the neighbouring Civil Services Stores in 1930 before its final move to the Mutual Life Assurance Building where it was located in the basement with the walls decorated with murals inspired by Charles Dicken's Pickwick Papers. To accommodate the club's needs, the architect Emil Sodersten redesigned the basement. Fund raising The book club's colours were orange and black, and to celebrate its first anniversary in 1929, a ball was held in support of the Royal Institute for Deaf and Blind Children.

Content In this book, Bubbio endorses a ‚Äúqualified revisionist interpretation‚Äù of Hegel. The term ‚Äúqualified revisionist‚Äù was coined by Paul Redding to refer to Beatrice Longuenesse‚Äôs tenets that Hegel‚Äôs metaphysics is ‚Äúan investigation of the universal determinations of thought at work in any attempt to think what is‚Äù and that ‚Äúmetaphysics after Kant is a science of being as being thought‚Äù.Beatrice Longuenesse, Hegel‚Äôs Critique of Metaphysics (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007), xvii. Bubbio, however, introduces a further qualification: an interpretation of the objective reality that Hegel wants for metaphysical objects (including religious ideas, such as the idea of God) as mediated objectivity, to refer to ‚Äúan objectivity that does not reflect the reality of an object distinct from and opposed to human consciousness, but an objectivity that takes into account the contribution of our self-conscious mind for the establishment of the content of that metaphysical object and thus reflects the relational unity between subject and object‚Äù.Bubbio, God and the Self in Hegel, p. 6 The same idea is expressed by Bubbio's iconic phrase that ‚Äúour gaze is always already part of reality, and reality is such because it includes our gaze‚Äù.Bubbio, God and the Self in Hegel, p. 65 Translated on a religious level, Bubbio advocates for a figural interpretation of religious notions in Hegel's philosophy and he argues that, in Hegel's view, ‚Äúsubjectivism can be avoided, and content can be restored to religion, only to the extent that God is understood in God‚Äôs relation to human beings and human beings are understood in their relation to God‚Äù.Bubbio, God and the Self in Hegel, p. 162 This explains, according to Bubbio, why for Hegel self-knowledge and knowledge of God are mutually dependent ‚Äì because this knowledge ‚Äúis possible only in the context of an epistemological openness (perspectivism) and practical openness (recognition)‚Äù.Bubbio, God and the Self in Hegel, p. 7,163 Bubbio takes this to be ‚ÄúHegel‚Äôs fundamental speculative intuition‚Äù. Hegel is therefore seen as providing an answer to the challenge of how to conceive the mind-world relation without setting mind over and against the world and as a way of overcoming subjectivism in both philosophy and religion. Also, in this way Bubbio connects his work on Hegel with his previous work on sacrifice, considered both in its epistemological and practical implications. Reception God and the Self in Hegel received significant attention in the field of Hegel scholarship, re-igniting a debate about the status of the idea of God in Hegel's philosophy. Some scholars welcomed Bubbio's move enthusiastically: Cyril O‚ÄôRegan wrote that ‚ÄúGod and the Self in Hegel makes essential contributions to the understanding of Hegel‚Äôs philosophical thought‚Äù covering topics such as Hegel's famous ‚Äòdeath of God‚Äô trope ‚Äúextraordinarily well‚Äù, and Philip T. Grier called it ‚Äúan impressive and also challenging examination of Hegel‚Äôs philosophy of religion‚Äù. Other scholars, while acknowledging the value of Bubbio's reconstruction, were more critical about its outcome, precisely insofar as it advocates for the centrality of the idea of God in Hegel's philosophy.Jean-Philippe Deranty, ‚ÄúDiego Bubbio, God and the Self in Hegel.

It was started by Aditi Gupta. Tuhin Paul and Rajat Mittal. Menstrupedia aims to help people understand the process of puberty in women and men. It seeks to destroy myths around menstruation and to normalise the biological process.  Background  When Aditi Gupta attained puberty at the age of 12, she found that menstruation is a taboo topic in her country. She had to follow Indian traditional customs that implied that a menstruating person was impure. As she grew up and moved away from her hometown, her perception of menstruation changed. She wished to spread more awareness to help girls understand their bodies better and not let society shame them for their biology. Gupta expanded what was initially her thesis project. She researched on the topic on menstruation by interviewing doctors and many young girls. In November 2012, she and her husband Tuhin Paul, the co-founder, launched the Menstrupedia Comic to help educate people about the natural process of menstruation.  The Comic  Menstrupedia explains menstruation by using relatable characters. In the comic, Priya Didi who is also a doctor, explains puberty to her younger cousin Pinki, and Pinki‚Äôs friends Jiya and Mira. As Jiya gets her first period during Pink‚Äôs birthday party, Priya Didi uses the opportunity to talk to the girls about menstrual health, hygiene and puberty as they curiously ask her questions on the subject.  Popularity  Since its launch, Menstrupedia has been gaining a lot of appreciation for its positive portrayal of menstruation. In 2019 their Facebook page had 49,000 likes and their Twitter account had 4600 followers. As of 2017, the comics had been translated into 14 languages including Nepali and Spanish.  The Blog  Menstrupedia also facilitates a blog which is a crowd-sourced platform. According to Aditi Gupta, \\"We have a community of 3000+ writers‚Äô men, women and children as young as 12 years could. We don‚Äôt ask people their gender: they could identify as men/women/gender non-conforming. But we have a record of their names and ages.\\" The website also contains a Q&A; and a Learn section.

It belongs to the family Microcotylidae.Zhang J.Y., Yang T.B. & Liu L. (2001). Monogeneans of Chinese marine fishes. Beijing: Agriculture Press, 400 pp. Taxonomy Microcotyle hainanensis was described based on 7 mounted specimens, collected from the gills of Branchiostegus auratus. The specific epithet hainanensis refers to the type (and only known) locality, Hainan. Description Microcotyle hainanensis has the general morphology of all species of Microcotyle, with a flat stout body, comprising an anterior part which contains most organs and a posterior part called the haptor. The haptor is symmetrical, nearly perpendicular to the body proper and bears 36-48 clamps, arranged as two rows, one on each side. The clamps of the haptor attach the animal to the gill of the fish. There are also two small buccal suckers at the anterior extremity. The digestive organs include an anterior, terminal mouth, a muscular rounded pharynx slightly larger than oral sucker, an oesophagus without diverticula and a posterior intestine bifurcating at the level of the copulatory organ in two with two lateral branches; the intestinal branches are provided with diverticula on both sides, terminating at the end of the haptor. Each adult contains male and female reproductive organs. The reproductive organs include an anterior heart-shaped genital atrium, armed with spines, a dorsal vagina which was not observed, a single question mark- shaped ovary, and 14-18 rounded or oval testes which are posterior to the ovary and arranged in two rows. The species can be distinguished from the most closely related species Microcotyle branchiostegi by the muscular cirrus armed with spines that is absent in M. branchiostegi, and by the number of clamps. Hosts The type and only recorded host is the tilefish species Branchiostegus auratus (Malacanthidae).

He was hanged for the murder of 17-year-old Josie Langmaid, which occurred in Pembroke, New Hampshire. Biography =Life and early crimes= LaPage was born as Joseph Paget in 1838, in an unnamed settlement northwest of Montreal. His parents, who were immigrants from France, were well-respected farmers in the area. When he was about 20 years old, Joseph married a woman three years older than him, with whom he had five children. Five years after their marriage, the family moved to Sainte-B√©atrix, where Joseph had already received a reputation as a bad, evil man. He frequently abused his wife and especially his eldest daughter, hanged around vile people, even going so far nearly killing his wife's sister, Julienne Rousse (who survived and testified as his later trial). LaPage was arrested, but knocked the officer down and fled to the United States. He took his family with him, and settled in St. Albans, Vermont, in September 1871. The following year, he briefly returned to his former residence, where he was suspected of setting on fire the home of a man connected to his arrest, and also attempting to assault a young unmarried woman. He had struck the woman with a club, causing her injuries that would last for a month. LaPage had also attempted to entice a 14-year-old girl into the woods with him, but failed. Soon after, he returned to St. Albans, where he lived a disreputable life, occasionally working as a farmhand and woodsman. =Murder of Mariette Ball= On July 24, 1874, Mariette N. Ball, a school teacher in St. Albans' nearby district, was murdered. Her daily trips from her home to work passed by a field in which LaPage worked, and he became fascinated by her. After many weeks of contemplation, on July 24, 1874, he decided to follow her. He gave an excuse that he was going to pick berries, and then cut through the woods and laid to wait at a hill. Ball was walking through the desolate path, en route to the residence of Foster A. Page, which she did every Saturday. LaPage, who had put on a roughly made mask made from an old mat, attacked Ball, who pleaded for her life and fought back viciously. During the struggle, she managed to tear away the mask and see LaPage's face. Despite her strong physique and the several scratches inflicted on the man's face, she was strangled to death by LaPage, who then had sex with her corpse. After he was finished, just to make sure that she wouldn't return to life, he bashed her head into a stone. The bloodied murderer then left the scene. Ball's body was soon found, and an investigation was launched to determine who had killed her. At one time, LaPage was arrested for the crime thanks to Geo M. Lang, who had been inquired about the departure of a train by LaPage, who had scratches on his face. He was brought before Sheriffs Newton and Swift, who inquired about the murder, but as they had no evidence and the hired detective from Boston had also seen other people in the district at the time of the murder, LaPage was released and others were investigated. In the end, nobody was convicted of the murder, and the Ball family moved to California, where Mr. Ball soon passed away. =Murder of Josie Langmaid= After the Ball murder, LaPage moved to Suncook, New Hampshire, where he was hired by Mr. Trueworthy L. Fowler to work as a substitute tender in Pembroke. While working there, he noticed a beautiful young girl and her classmate (Langmaid), and inquired Fowler's son about who the girl was. The son told it was his sister, and then LaPage continued to ask where she had come from and if she passed through the old road, to which the brother replied positively. Learning of this, LaPage then proceeded to wait for the girl out in the woods near Pembroke on October 14, 1875, but as she did not appear, he instead focused his attention on another target - 17-year-old Josie Langmaid. She had just left her father's house and was walking towards school, when she turned towards the old road, and when she was seen by LaPage, he immediately attacked her. A severe struggle ensued, with LaPage tearing through the girl's clothes, raping her before beginning to hit her with a stick, before taking out his knife and cutting Josie's throat so deeply that he began decapitating her. Even after she had died, he took her body to the nearby woods, where he fully decapitated her and then brought her head to another spot along the road, before leaving to wash his hands, coat and knife in a nearby brook. Leaving the body there, he returned to the place where he had left his axe, and a little further ahead he hid the wallet, ring and other items he had stolen from the girl. Soon after, he returned to his home in Suncook, where he then burned his clothes. When inquired by his wife about the scratches on his neck, he claimed that they were caused by poison ivy. Discovery and arrest Langmaid's body was soon found in the woods, and authorities immediately began searching for the perpetrator. Initially suspicions fell on a local named Bill Drew, who was nearly lynched by an outraged mob. However, Mr. Fowler's son remembered his conversation with LaPage, and immediately he was sought after. Meanwhile, a Mr. W. N. Abell, with whom Mariette Ball had boarded in St. Albans, read about the Langmaid murder, and knowing that LaPage had moved away to Suncook last summer. He contacted the authorities in Suncook and gave the suspected murderer's name, and since they knew that LaPage's children worked in the nearby factory, they asked his employer about the location of the man's residence. When they went there, Mr. Fowler immediately recognised the man who worked him, and LaPage was immediately arrested. Trial, sentence and death At his initial trial, LaPage was convicted and sentenced to death, but as he complained that it was unfair towards, he was ordered to have a second trial, in which he was convicted yet again. He was put in an isolated cell, where he was noted as repeating prayers, pacing around and looking gloomily out the window. He was visited several times by reporters and religious figures, and confessed to them the murders of both Langmaid and Ball, saying: \\"I kill gal. Yes, I kill two gal. Too bad, too bad.\\" LaPage couldn't read either English or French, and instead had a calendar with a mark indicating March 15, the date of his execution. When the day came, Sheriff Dodge and his deputies came and brought him to the scaffold. He was accompanied by Fathers Barret and Millett, repeating their prayers slowly in French. Despite his predicament, LaPage was reported as being very calm and in a peaceful demeanor. After his death warrant was read, Sheriff Dodge remarked in a husky tone: \\"And now Joseph LaPage, in accordance with the command, I proceed to execute the sentence of death, by hanging you by the neck until you are dead, and may God have mercy on your soul.\\" After finishing, he pressed the button and the trap door opened. LaPage dropped about six feet, and soon died slowly, without even a kick or convulsion. His body, on request by his wife, was then buried in the cemetery of Suncook's Catholic church. Discovery of earlier murders In less than a month after LaPage's execution, a tip came from Saint-Alexandre, Quebec, that he most likely had murdered a mother and daughter there. According to George Fountie, his wife and 16-year-old daughter Minnie had been murdered by LaPage on October 12, 1867. The pair had gone to the village, about two and a half miles away from their home, for trading purposes. After the wife met a fellow lady friend, they had dinner at her house and stayed there until half past six, but never returned home that night. On the dawn of the new day, Mr. Fountie, anxious that something horrible had happened, immediately began looking for them, assisted by the community. Following a long, exhaustive search, the mutilated bodies of both women were located under a brush pile off the main road, in a nearby pasture. Minnie, like Josie Langmaid, had been raped and her body mutilated, with the exception that her head hadn't been decapitated. A scamp by the name of Horace H. Martin was arrested, but soon released due to lack of evidence and the fact that he wasn't even near the area when the murders occurred. However, Joseph LaPage was in the village at the time, doing business in the local post office. He was standing in the office doorway when the women passed by him on their way home. He followed them, and as they turned a corner in the street, he began speaking to them in an insulting way, which was resented by the mother and daughter. They said that if he didn't mind his own business, they would have him arrested, and LaPage soon went back to the post office, with neither party aware that the entire conversation was overheard by a man who had passed by. When he returned to the post office, LaPage said in an irritated tone that \\"if the women did have him 'hauled up' they would be sorry some time.\\" He then left and crossed a field toward the north side of the village, which, coincidentally, had a path leading directly to where the bodies were found. LaPage was never suspected of the murders at the time, but when he confessed to the Ball murder, Fountie was thoroughly convinced that he was the perpetrator. He claimed that if the murderer was alive, he would be convicted without much trouble, but also said that it didn't matter now, only showing the world at large the dangerous character of the man who had died on the scaffold.

In the same year she followed the move of the court of Charles Theodore to Schloss Benrath in D√ºsseldorf where she was appointed the first female teacher under Lambert Krahe at the Kunstakademie D√ºsseldorf.

After education at Grosvenor School in Edwalton, Nottinghamshire, Frank Dudley Hart spent two years studying in an Anglican seminary before switching to the study of medicine in Edinburgh. He graduated MB ChB in 1933 from the medical school of the University of Edinburgh. From 1933 to 1938 he held junior appointments at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh, Paddington Green Children's Hospital, Royal Northern Hospital, and Royal Brompton Hospital. At Westminster Hospital he was appointed a registrar and then a senior registrar. In 1939 in anticipation of the bombing of London, the people at Westminster Hospital were evacuated ‚Äî Hart and three other surgeons remained to run the evacuated hospital as a casualty clearing station. In 1942 he joined the RAMC. He served as a major in charge of a medical division of the RAMC in Iraq, North Africa and Italy and was mentioned in despatches. He attained the rank of lieutenant colonel. At the Westminster Hospital he was appointed in 1946 an assistant physician and later a consultant physician. He remained in that post until his retirement from the National Health Service in 1974. Until 1987 he continued in private practice. Hart was the first to recognise that ankylosing spondylitis is a different disease from rheumatoid arthritis. He was elected FRCP in 1949. In 1952, Hart chaired the Royal College of Physicians committee on rheumatology and put forth a plan for a research institute devoted to rheumatology. Mathilda Marks Kennedy, one of the five children of Michael Marks, gave half a million pounds to establish the Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology, affiliated to Charing Cross Hospital. Under the auspices of the Royal College of Physicians, he delivered in 1975 the Bradshaw Lecture on Inflammatory disease and its control in the different rheumatic disorders. He wrote, or contributed to, more than 20 medical books and 200 scientific papers. In the late 1920s and early 1930s he paid for his medical school education by playing the saxophone in nightclubs.

Early life Naciye Sultan was born on 25 October 1896 in the Feriye Palace. Her father was ≈ûehzade Selim S√ºleyman, and her mother was Ay≈üe Tarziter Hanƒ±m, an Abkhazian lady from the Bargan-Ipa family. She was the second child, and only daughter born to her father and the eldest child of her mother. She had a full brother, ≈ûehzade Mehmed ≈ûerefeddin, seven years younger than her. She was the paternal granddaughter of Sultan Abdulmejid I and Serfiraz Hanƒ±m. Her family used spent their winters in the Feriye Palace, and their summers in the Nisbetiyye Mansion located in Bebek. =Education= Naciye was educated privately. Her first teacher was Ayn√Æz√¢de Tahsin Efendi, who taught her alphabets. Her second teacher was Hafez Ihsan Efendi with whom she took her Turkish lessons for many years before he was replaced with Halid Ziya Bey (U≈üaklƒ±gil). She also took French and Turkish lessons from a German lady named Fraulein Funke, who was later named Adile when she converted to Islam. When Naciye got older, she also started taking music lessons. She took her piano and violin lessons from the saz teacher Ud√Æ Andon. She also took piano lessons from a German teacher named Braun, while her piano instructors were Lange and Hege. Naciye Sultan especially liked piano lessons and her piano teacher Hege. Hege was a piano teacher at Mekteb-i Harbiyye for a while and was one of the most famous pianists of Istanbul at that time. =Engagement to Abd√ºrrahim= When ≈ûehzade Abdurrahim Hayri, son of Sultan Abdul Hamid II came of age of marriage, his father decided that he would marry Naciye Sultan. However, Naciye and her family were not immediately informed of this decision. But when they came to know about the decision, both her father and mother turned against to this because Naciye was only twelve years old at that time. However, her father couldn't opposed his brother, and was obliged to accept it. And so Naciye was engaged to Abd√ºrrahim. First marriage =Engagement= Ismail Enver Pasha became the subject of gossip about an alleged romance between him and Princess Iffet of Egypt. When this story reached Istanbul, the grand vizier, H√ºseyin Hilmi Pasha decided to exploit Enver's marital eligibility by arranging a rapprochement between the Committee for Union and Progress and the imperial family. After a careful search, the grand vizier chose Naciye Sultan as Enver's future bride. Both the grand vizier and Enver's mother then notified him of this decision. Enver had never seen Naciye Sultan, and he did not trust his mother's letters, since he suspected her of being enamored with the idea of having a princess as her daughter-in-law. Therefore, he asked a reliable friend, Ahmed Rƒ±za Bey, who was a member of the Turkish Parliament to investigate. When the latter reported favorably on the prospective bride's education and beauty, as well as on the prospective dowry, Enver took a practical view of this marriage and accepted the arrangement. Naciye had been previously engaged to ≈ûehzade Abdurrahim Hayri, son of Sultan Abdul Hamid II for three years. However, Sultan Mehmed V broke off the engagement, and in April 1909, when Naciye was just twelve years old, engaged her to Enver. Following the old Ottoman pattern of life and tradition, the engagement ceremony was celebrated in Enver's absence as he remained in Berlin. However, as Naciye was then still under age the marriage did not take place until 1914. =Marriage= The marriage took place on 5 March 1914 in the Ni≈üanta≈üƒ± Palace. The wedding celebrations took place on 10 May. The couple were given one of the palaces of Kuru√ße≈üme. In August 1916, 'The Society for Muslim Working Women' was setup in the capital. It had three branches in Istanbul, Pera, and √úsk√ºdar. Its president was Naciye Sultan, while Enver himself served as its patron. Naciye's leading role in this society was a clear sign of the committee's involvement in integrating women into a life beyond the household. The society regulated the working conditions of women and encouraged them to get married and form a family. On 17 May 1917, Naciye Sultan gave birth to the couple's eldest child, a daughter, Mahpeyker Hanƒ±msultan. She was followed by a second daughter, T√ºrkan Hanƒ±msultan, born on 4 July 1919. Both of them were born in Istanbul. During Enver's stay in Berlin, Naciye Sultan and her daughters Mahpeyker and T√ºrkan joined him. When Enver left for Soviet Russia his family remained there. His son, Sultanzade Ali Bey was born in Berlin on 29 September 1921, after Enver's departure and he never saw him. Naciye was widowed at Enver's death on 4 August 1922. Second marriage After Enver Pasha's death, Naciye Sultan married his younger brother, Mehmed Kamil Pasha on 30 October 1923 in Berlin. Following the exile of the imperial family in March 1924, Naciye and her husband settled in Paris. Here Naciye gave birth to the couple's only child, a daughter, Rana Hanƒ±msultan on 25 February 1926. In 1933, she met with her brother ≈ûehzade Mehmed ≈ûerefeddin in Nice, she met her brother nine years after the exile of the imperial family in 1924. In the beginning of World War II Naciye and her husband settled in Bern, Switzerland. Naciye Sultan can't endure her longing for a child, her daughters Mahpeyker, T√ºrkan and Rana were brought to Switzerland by there uncle Nuri Pasha, Ali was in Istanbul, due to studies he wasn't able to come. In 1943, Mahpeyker and T√ºrkan returned to Istanbul. In 1946, after the end of world war, Naciye, her husband and there daughter Rana returned to Paris. Naciye Sultan ensured that her children received a good education. Her eldest daughter Mahpeyker became a doctor, and her younger daughter T√ºrkan graduated from chemistry. In 1946, T√ºrkan married H√ºveyda Mayatepek, a foreign minister. Naciye Sultan was unable to attend the wedding of her daughter, later Mahpeyker married her colleague Doctor Fikret √úrg√ºpl√º, again Naciye was unable to attend her wedding either. Naciye Sultan's son Ali married Perizad Hanƒ±m, daughter of Abdidin Daver. Naciye went to London with her son as he was air fire assistant there, she spend two months there and then went to Switzerland to her daughter T√ºrkan. In 1949, Naciye divorced K√¢mil Pasha, but the divorce was just a formality. In 1952, Naciye Sultan and her family returned to Istanbul after the revocation of the law of exile for princesses. Here she settled in Ni≈üanta≈üƒ±. Death Naciye Sultan died on 4 December 1957 due to liver cancer at the age of sixty-one and was buried beside her father due to her last will in the mausoleum of ≈ûehzade Ahmed Kemaleddin, Yahya Efendi cemetery.

She arrived in the colony as a child in 1610 and was established as one of the few female ancient planters by 1620. After her husband Samuel Jordan died in 1623, Cecily obtained oversight of his 450-acre plantation, Jordan‚Äôs Journey. In the Jamestown Muster of 1624/25, she is one of fewer than 10 women who are mentioned as a head of household, and the only woman listed as sharing the head of household with a man she was not married to. In the year of Samuel Jordan's death, she also set off the first breach of promise lawsuit in English North America when she chose the marriage proposal of William Farrar, who was bonded to help settle her estate, over that of Greville Pooley, who claimed his proposal had already been accepted. In 1625, Cecily prevailed when Pooley withdrew his claim. Afterwards, she married William Farrar. The early years in the Virginia Colony Sidney King's painting of tobacco farming illustrates the activity that made plantations like Jordan's Journey successful. Nothing is known of Cecily's life and background before she came to the New World. She was among the earliest women to arrive in Jamestown, Virginia. When Cecily arrived onboard Swan in August 1611, she was around 10 years old and one of 20 women among the 260 passengers.. Her arrival was part of a series of transports that were intended to replenish Jamestown's population. During the previous year's Starving Time, Jamestown had been reduced to only 60 people, and was saved from abandonment by the last-minute arrival of an earlier transport in June 1610 led by Lord De La Warr. Cecily's first years in the colony were during the first Anglo- Powhatan war, which resulted in the deaths of over 400 settlers and Powhatan people and only ended with John Rolfe‚Äôs marriage to Pocahantas in 1614. In 1618, the Great Charter enacted by the Virginia Company as instructions to Virginia‚Äôs Governor George Yeardley established a grant for colonists who had lived in Virginia for at least three years and had paid their way to the colony through their own money or working off their debt for being transported. The instructions called these colonists ancient planters, and each received a grant of 100 acres of land as their dividend for investing in the Virginia Company. She is identified as an ancient planter in a 1620 patent and was one of the very few women that received this grant. Marriage to Samuel Jordan Virginia Historical Highway Marker of Jordan's Journey, where Cecily was a head of household. By 1620, Cecily had married Samuel Jordan and was living at Jordan‚Äôs Journey, a 450 acre plantation on the James River. A year later, she gave birth to their daughter Mary. Cecily and her family survived the Powhatan surprise attack in 1622 that initiated the Second Anglo- Powhatan War. Although nearly a third of all the colonists in Virginia were killed in this surprise attack, nobody was listed as among the slain at Jordan‚Äôs Journey. After the attack, Jordan‚Äôs Journey provided a safe haven for survivors whose plantations were on the upper James River. The breach of promise suit and marriage to William Farrar Dramatization of Cecily Jordan rejecting Greville Pooley's claims Samuel Jordan died in early 1623,, when Cecily was pregnant with their daughter, Margaret. Cecily was then authorized to settle her husband‚Äôs estate, and William Farrar, a colonist who had left his own land after the Powhatan attack and moved to Jordan‚Äôs Journey, was bonded to help her. During this time, Jordan's Journey prospered. About three or four days after Samuel Jordan‚Äôs death, Reverend Greville Pooley claimed to have proposed marriage to Cecily and also claimed she accepted. However, she instead chose to contract herself to William Farrar before Governor Yeardley and the Council of Virginia and disavowed Pooley‚Äôs claim. As a result of Cecily's action, Pooley initiated the first breach of promise suit in English- speaking North America. After two years of litigation, the case was resolved in Cecily's favor in 1625. Pooley discharged her from all contracts and bound himself to a ¬£500 bond stating that he would never have any claims, rights or titles over her. While the case was ongoing, Cecily and William Farrar both lived at Jordan's Journey and continued to work together, and both \\"Mr. William Ferrar and Mrs. Jordan\\" were named as the heads of the household in the Jamestown Muster of 1624/25. By May 1625 Cecily and Farrar were finally married, and they had three children together: Cecily, William, and John. It is not known when Cecily died. The last year she is mentioned is 1631 in the record of William Farrar‚Äôs sale of his assets in England. Relationship to Temperance Baley Historical marker for Bailey's Creek that assumes Cecily is the mother of Temperance Bailey and notes that her father is unknown. In the Jamestown Muster of 1624/25, the list of members of Cecily and William Farrar's household includes Temperance Baley (now spelled Bailey), who was listed as seven years old and born in Virginia. Temperance is listed as receiving a patent for 100 acres in 1620, when she was about two or three years of age; she is also listed having 200 acres planted in 1625. In addition, Samuel Jordan‚Äôs 1620 patent lists her properties as adjoining his. Based on this evidence, a number of researchers have concluded that Temperance may be Cecily‚Äôs daughter from a previous husband named Baley. However, there is no direct documentation that she is Temperance's mother or that she had a husband before marrying Samuel Jordan. In addition, Temperance‚Äôs father has not been conclusively identified.

The memoir was famously adapted into the 1986 erotic drama 9¬Ω Weeks, starring Kim Basinger and Mickey Rourke. Synopsis The memoir is set in New York City. An art gallery owner enters a nine-week affair with a brutal, brutish, sadomasochistic Wall Street broker who regularly sexually abuses her in his apartment for amusement and pleasure. Unable to say no and sinking into complicity, the woman finds herself enjoying the beginning of the affair. Eventually, the relationship culminates in criminality, depravity and violence when he convinces her to rob a man at knifepoint in an elevator and forces her into having sex with someone else while he watches. The woman is forced to make a choice between her life and sanity or a mentally impoverished man incapable of feeling love, but who has manipulated her to love him. He often leaves her tied up, in immense pain, in his opulent apartment for hours at a time. The memoir ends after her nervous breakdown, when he leaves her at a mental hospital. After undergoing therapy that lasts for months, she never sees him again. Reception and legacy The novel caused a scandal when published. Day committed suicide at the age of 70 in 2011. In a 2012 New Yorker article, Sarah Weinman writes \\"Nine and a Half Weeks is a potent antidote to what passes for erotica today. Instead of over- the-top fictional fantasy, McNeill‚Äôs book, presented as memoir, is charged as much by explicitness as it is by absence. The reader is only privy to her perspective, and even then, it‚Äôs occluded by the use of a pseudonym\\".

Life  Hess was born in Berlin-Britz. Her father, Ludwig Hess, was the director of a Riedel de Ha√´n factory. Her mother, Hertha Hess, was a trained nurse. Her parents sent Hess to a monastery school from which she graduated in 1939. This school was closed by the National Socialists a year later.

In 1944, Hess completed her training at the Reichsanstalt f√ºr Lebensmittel und Arzneimittelchemie in Berlin and became a state-certified food chemist, before joining the independent testing laboratory of her father, which he took over in 1931. Such analytical laboratories for food monitoring supplemented the state institutions. While working at her father's institute, Hess simultaneously studied for her doctorate with Josef Schorm√ºller at the Institute of Food Chemistry of the Technical University of Berlin, which she finished in 1953. In 1954, she became the first publicly appointed female Handelschemiker (professional consultant industrial chemist) in Berlin.

The library opened in 1906. It closed as a public lending library in 2016 as a result of cuts to funding, reopening in 2018 with a reduced librarian service.  History  The Carnegie Library was funded by a grant of ¬£12,500 from Andrew Carnegie (1835‚Äì1919) and designed by the architects Wakeford and Sons. This building was one of 2,800 libraries established worldwide with a legacy from Carnegie. Like many Carnegie libraries, the Herne Hill library has elegant architectural features, such as large windows and a glass dome which provide plenty of natural light, graceful Corinthian columns, and parquet floors. It was opened in 1906 and is a Grade II listed building. Historic England notes as one of its reasons for the Grade II designation that \\"the library is almost unchanged externally, and the internal arrangement remains legible despite later, internal alterations which are largely reversible\\".  Present day  The library was closed by Lambeth Council from March 2016 to February 2018, when it reopened with a reduced service. The library was occupied in protest at its closure for nine days by members of the local community, including senior citizens and teenagers studying for A level exams. Protesters from campaign group Defend The Ten voluntarily left the library before being evicted, and the occupation ended with a protest march to Brixton Library. The occupation was supported by many famous authors including Stella Duffy, Neil Gaiman, Nick Hornby and Colm T√≥ib√≠n, and had a great deal of public support, as shown by a mass demonstration of over 2,000 people who marched from the library to the town hall when the occupation ended.

After the Japanese assassination of Korean Empress Myeongseong caused national unrest in 1895, Yun began supporting Korean militia troops, also known as righteous armies. Yun sent threats and declarations of war to Japanese army commanders and Korean soldiers who served Japan; actively promoted the cause of Korean independence among women; and composed dozens of nationalistic battle songs. Her battle song Ansaram euibyeong ga (Song of the Women's Militia) was the first Korean militia song composed by a woman and the first militia song written down in the Korean language. In 1907, Yun created and led the first all-woman righteous army, training her militia in fighting techniques herself. She continued supporting Korea's fight for independence until her death. The South Korean government posthumously awarded Yun a presidential medal of citation and the National Medal of Order of Merit for National Foundation.  Early life  19th-century Seoul, Korea Yun Hui-sun was born in 1860 in Seoul. Her father was Yun Ik-sang, and their ancestors had come from Haeju. Yun was known for both her high spirits and her devotion to her family. When Yun was 16, she married Yu Jae-won, the son of militia commander Yu Hong-seok, and the couple lived in Nammyon, Chunche. Yun and Yu Jae-won had a son named Yu Don-sang.  Military involvement  Funeral procession for the assassinated Empress Myeongseong (c. 1890s) In 1895, the Japanese assassination of Korean Empress Myeongseong ignited public unrest across Korea, and Yun's father-in-law prepared his militia for war. Violent conflict began between Korean and Japanese soldiers. Although Yun pleaded to join the fight, her father-in-law refused permission. Yun was left at home. Instead of being content with household chores, however, Yun sent written declarations of war to Japanese army commanders, and wrote threatening letters to Korean soldiers who had chosen to serve the Japanese. She encouraged other women to support Korea's total independence from Japan. Yun also composed dozens of songs for Korean militia troops, nine of which are still known today. One of Yun's battle songs, Ansaram euibyeong ga (Song of the Women's Militia), was the first Korean militia song composed by a woman and the first militia song written down in the Korean language: > However strong and prosperous / the Japanese may be, / If united, we can > defeat them easily. / Let the world say we are mere women, / But how can we > not know love for the country, / Without a country, any use for man or > woman? / Let us march out to join the righteous army, / Let us help our > militia troops, / If they are seized by beasts, / Would the Japanese ever > save them? / Let us help our militia troops. / Success for us, hurrah for > our nation! / Ten thousand hurrahs for women! In 1907, Yun created a militia of women ‚Äì Korea's first female righteous army. The militia consisted of about 30 women. Yun raised funds to support Korean troops and organized the installation of a weapons factory in Jusan, Yeouinaegol. In 1911, after the Japanese began occupying Korea, Yun's father- in-law Yu Hong-seok left Korea and travelled to southern Manchuria in order to regroup with his soldiers and develop a new military strategy. Before Yun and her son could follow, they were arrested and threatened by Japanese police, who demanded to know the whereabouts of Yu Hong-seok. Yun refused to reveal any information, and the Japanese finally left them alone, impressed by her fortitude. Between 1913 and 1915, Yun lost both her husband and father-in-law; her husband had been arrested and tortured by Japanese police. Yun continued to train her militia women and led them in attacks on Japanese camps. She encouraged both male and female militia groups to work together and become more effective. Freeing Korean prisoners from Japanese camps, Yun hid them in secret caves and helped them survive. Later in her life, she founded a school and trained new independence fighters.  Death and legacy  Yun died in the summer of 1935, eleven days after her son had died in the custody of the Japanese. She bequeathed a document to her descendants entitled Ilsaengnok (A Record of my Life). After her death, Yun's actions were posthumously honoured by the South Korean government. She was awarded a presidential medal of citation and the National Medal of Order of Merit for National Foundation. On October 20, 1994, the South Korean government arranged for Yun's and her husband's remains to be returned and buried at the burial site of Yun's ancestors.

The Soundtrack contains 61 tracks on two CDs and has a running-time of about two hours. The album was released on September 14, 2016 via Pony Canyon. A western release was done in 2017 by Anime Limited in North America. A Shape of Light peaked at no. 74 on the Japanese Albums Chart where it lasted for about five weeks in the rankings.  Production history  Kensuke Ushio who creates EBM music under his moniker agraph. was announced to be the soundtrack's composer in May 2016 after he got asked to write the music for Kyoto Animation's anime movie A Silent Voice back in 2015. Most of the tracks were composed by Ushio himself while all tracks called inv are based on the Invention No. 1 in C mayor, BWV 772 originally composed by Johann Sebastian Bach. Ushio worked alongside movie director Naoko Yamada which had a very similar point of view when it came across the concept of the film and music.Interview mit Kensuke Ushio (Musik). In: A Silent Voice ‚Äì Deluxe Edition. VIZ Media Switzerland SA (Kaz√© Anime), Berlin 2018, EAN 7630017513557. Kensuke Ushio described the movie as Sh≈çyas story which deals about his contacts with other people and how treats them which was a universal theme when it cames to bring it out of context. For working on the films' music Ushio was shown several scenarios. He stated that he put full effort in the recordings of the sounds. The movie soundtrack was recorded at the Maruni Studios in Tokyo. The track slt featured guest musician Yuji Katsui on violin. The mixing of the first disc was done by Hiroshi Kitashiro, while Ushio mixed the second CD himself. The mastering was done at Kimken Studios. In an interview Ushio stated he had not really worked on film scores that often before working on A Silent Voice's soundtrack. Yamada who had known Ushio's music before contacted his management requesting his involvement in composing the soundtrack. The work on the film's score began when most parts of the storyboard had to be elaborated. The studio works ended when sound director Yuta Tsuruoka got the final musical concept and approved it.  Background  Ushio wrote 82 tracks in total for the soundtrack. 61 made it on the official soundtrack while 50 tracks are listenable during the movie. Most of the tracks are written for piano. The tracks' titles on the first CD consist of three letters, with exceptions of the inv titles, van(var), lvs(var) and lit(var). The three -letter titles are identification codes created by Ushio himself while composing the titles and which he got feedback for. Ushio decided that he would use his identification codes as song names instead of renaming them in order to tell the listener their possible meanings. Instead he wanted the listeners to came up with their own interpretations. Even though those codes aren't arbitrary. So htb on the first CD stands for heart beat which is the first track on the second CD and another version of that track. Ushio describes the inv tracks as the most important songs on the soundtrack. He stated that Bach's Invention is splitable in three parts as well as the movie's plot why every part got some inv tracks on it. Regarding the movie the inv title and their adaptions is an example of learning how to communicate and how Sh≈çya made it throughout the movie to overcome his guilt in Elementary School and how he invented a new way of communication. At the final scene on the movie where Sh≈çya and Sh≈çko are seen visiting the Highschool's culture festival the final part of Bach's Invention is played symbolising the end of Sh≈çyas lession in communication. lit which is only played two times throughout the whole movie stands for Light. Ushio stated the movie is about reaching the light which is why the songs was played at the very end of the film.  Tracklist   Critics  The soundtrack peaked at no. 74 in the Japanese Albums Chart at the week of September 14, 2016 where it was able to be for five weeks on the rankings.Charts: James Marsh of South China Morning Post wrote that the discordant sounding score by Ushio lays an unsettling layer on the complex sounding landscape of the film which brings the viewer nearer to Sh≈çko Nishimiyas world's view. In a movie review at Anime News Network Kevin Cirugeda wrote that Kensuke Ushio and Naoko Yamada worked closely together on the soundtrack resulting ‚Äì excluding the licensed My Generation by The Who ‚Äì in gentle piano sounds, ambient sounds and pure silence. There are no significant tracks instead the films as whole was described as a sensory experience where the sounds play as such of a role like the background music used in the movie. Readers of Anime UK News voted the soundtrack as Best Soundtrack at the Anime UK Reader‚Ä≤s Choice Awards alongside the musical score of The Ancient Magus' Bride.

Bright Memory received largely positive reviews by critics upon release. It was developed by a single developer in his spare time. It is currently being developed into a full-length game titled Bright Memory: Infinite (), planning to be released on Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S in 2021.  Gameplay  Bright Memory is a first-person shooter with melee elements. Players take control of Shelia, who, in addition to using guns and a sword, also has supernatural abilities such as psychokinesis and unleashing energy blasts. All forms of attack can be combined as desired and the game will award letter grades to creative combinations similar to Devil May Cry. Success in combat awards experience points that can be used to augment the character's skills and to unlock more abilities such as stopping time. Additionally, some areas feature puzzles that need to be solved. The early access version of the first episode features about an hour of gameplay with the developer announcing another two hours of gameplay by the end of 2019 with more episodes in the following years.  Synopsis  Protagonist Shelia is tasked by the Science Research Organization (SRO) for which she works to prevent SAI, a military organization, from acquiring a legendary ancient power that can reawaken the dead. The game takes place in a \\"Land of Sky\\" located above the Arctic consisting of levitating land masses which are home to ancient creatures.  Development  Bright Memory was developed by Zeng ‚ÄúFYQD‚Äù Xiancheng using Unreal Engine 4 with development work taking place in the developer's spare time. Zeng first previewed the game in a trailer in 2017 and received financial support through Epic Games's Unreal Dev Grants. An early access version of \\"Episode One\\" was released worldwide on 12 January 2019. The game supports the Oculus Rift virtual reality goggles. = Stolen assets controversy = In January 2019, Zeng admitted on a post on Sina Weibo that he has used some enemy models without acquiring a license and modified them for use in the game but did not specify which models or which games they were from. In reaction, Zeng has announced that he will use the money from the game's sale to hire an art designer and reach out to the original rights holders.  Reception  Bright Memory's \\"Episode 1\\" was positively received by critics who praised the game's mechanics, graphics and entertainment value. The game is also criticized for having occasional bugs, and almost unintelligible instructions (translated from Chinese). Nevertheless, Rock, Paper, Shotgun opined that the game has both the look and feel of a shooter game developed with a large budget, and 'wipes the floor' compared to some much higher priced games. The music and translation were criticized as was the short length since the game does not feature any endless mode.

As part of her work on Alawa, she translated both Alawa-language stories and kriol versions of the same given by her informant Barnabas Roberts concerning violent encounters between white settlers and the Alawa, and, according to one reviewer, their juxtaposition underlined that Aboriginal story-telling in their English dialects can be at times as, if not more, revealing as what is recorded of an event in their mother tongue. Sharpe went on to do extensive work as lecturer at the Department of Aboriginal and Multicultural Studies of the University of New England, on the Yugambeh- Baandjalung dialect chain.

Mao Lizi is one of the founding members of the Stars, and featured in the 1979 exhibition, as well as subsequent retrospectives. The group made headlines in 1979 when they held an unauthorized exhibition at the gates of the China Arts Gallery (now the National Art Museum of China). Mao Lizi's work was featured in subsequent exhibitions on historical Chinese artists, including the Guggenheim exhibition \\"5000 Years Of Chinese Arts\\". In 1990, Mao Lizi was guest lecturer at the Beaux Arts de Paris school, and has spent 10 years of his life in Paris. His work has since been shown in solo and group exhibitions in New York, Paris, and Hong Kong, as well as in China, including at Long museum in Shanghai, in the exhibition Experiencing Simplicity: Realistic Paintings from Long Collection . In 2019, Mao Lizi had a solo exhibition in the recently opened space of the gallery A&R; Fleury in Avenue Matignon, Paris. https://www.arty- buzz.fr/exposition-du-peintre-chinois-mao-lizi-du-21-mars-au-25-mai/ Mael Bellec, the curator of the Cernuschi Museum, wrote on the occasion of this exhibition a text evoking the historical context of the artist as one of the members of the Stars: \\"The variety of styles employed by Mao Lizi, in a figurative vein marked by hyperrealism to the abstract compositions of more recent years, is a striking testimony of the way in which the heritage of the Stars continues\\". https://www.arfleury.com/wp/wp- content/uploads/2019/03/CATALOGUE-MAO-LIZI-2019_-WEB-ISSUU.pdf List of some important exhibitions: 1984 35th Anniversary of People‚Äôs Republic of China Exhibition, National Museum of China, Beijing 1985 Contemporary Oil Painting Exhibition, National Art Museum of China, Beijing 1989 The Stars 10 Years, Hong Kong 1990 Salon de Jeune Peinture, Grand Palais, Paris 1998 China: 5000 Years, Solomon R.

The tree is thought to be between 150 and 400 years old and the oldest in the East End of London. History The site of the tree is just to the east of Bonner Road. In the mid-16th century this would have formed part of the gardens of the palace of Bishop Bonner, later known as Bishop's Hall.https://www.spitalfieldslife.com/2018/09/17/how-old-is-the-bethnal-green- mulberry/ In the Book of Martyrs, published in 1563, the Bishop is depicted flogging a martyr next to a sapling - suspected to be the very same mulberry. In the 17th century, Spitalfields, immediately southwest of Bethnal Green, was the centre of London's silk-weaving industry. Silk was produced from mulberry silkworms - which eat white mulberry leaves. However, a large number of black mulberries were mistakenly imported into London at the time by King James I, and the Bethnal Green mulberry tree may well be one of them.https://www.spitalfieldslife.com/2016/06/29/a-brief-history-of-londons- mulberries/ A key piece of evidence lies in the archive of the Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel. An inkwell (a preserved slice of a tree) from 1911 is recorded as having been taken from a broken bough of a mulberry 'reputed to be that under which Bishop Bonner went to sit in the cool of the evening'. The mulberry tree now sits on the site of the London Chest Hospital, opened in 1855 by a group of Victorian philanthropists. Nurses from the hospital reportedly danced around the tree in their leisure time. In 1945, in the last few months of the Second World War, the tree was damaged by a bomb that fell on the London Chest Hospital. The hospital chapel was destroyed but the mulberry tree survived. Charring can still be seen on the tree today. Relocation Since 2017 the Bethnal Green mulberry has been the subject of fierce local contention. In April 2015 the London Chest Hospital closed and the site was purchased by a housing developer. In early 2017 the developer obtained permission from Tower Hamlets Council's Arboricultural team to relocate the mulberry tree, prior to submitting a planning application to redevelop the hospital and surrounding grounds. The Bethnal Green mulberry is subject to a Tree preservation order, issued by Tower Hamlets Council. In 2017 a Judicial Review was brought, arguing that the age of the tree had been underestimated - that it was in fact a 'veteran' tree. These are covered by the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), which states: 'development resulting in the loss or deterioration of irreplaceable habitats (such as ancient woodland and ancient or veteran trees) should be refused, unless there are wholly exceptional reasons and a suitable compensation strategy exists'. It was argued that the risks associated with moving a veteran tree meant that permission to relocate it ought not to have been granted.http://www.flac.uk.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/London-Chest- Hospital-Advice.pdf Tower Hamlets Council agreed and the plans were temporarily suspended. In a lecture on the mulberry tree given in March 2018, Julian Forbes Laird (of Forbes Laird Arboricultural Consultancy) stated that the 'proposal to relocate it is unlikely to succeed. The tree will either fall apart or die, or possibly both'. A petition titled 'Save the Bethnal Green Mulberry' was launched in 2017 by the East End Preservation Society. It had reached 10,000 signatures by September 2018. In addition, Tower Hamlets council received three hundred letters of objection. At the time of the 2011 census there were 13,683 residents in Bethnal Green. The planning application, including relocation of the mulberry tree, went to Tower Hamlets planning committee in September 2018. Three councillors voted to reject the plans and four voted to approve (with one abstention), and the tree was agreed be relocated to the lawn in front of the old hospital entrance.

The MPA is 51 kilometres long, and extends 5 nautical miles to sea. The whole MPA is a restricted area (No Take zone) and is part of the migratory route and calving area for Southern right whales. The area protects habitats for several economically important inshore reef fish species, and ensures the retention of marine biomass in this part of the coast. The limestone coastline is includes archaeological sites and middens that date back centuries. The MPA is close to the Breede River estuary and, provides protection for species like cob (Argyrosomus spp.) that breed in the estuary and then return to the ocean. History The MPA was proclaimed by the Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism, Mohammed Valli Moosa, in Government Gazette No. 21948 of 29 December 2000 in terms section 43 of the Marine Natural Resources Act, 18 of 1998. The area was previously established as a nature reserve in 1985. Purpose A marine protected area is defined by the IUCN as \\"A clearly defined geographical space, recognised, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values\\". Extent The length of the protected shoreline is 51 km, and the area of protected ocean is 288.9 km2 =Zonation= The whole of De Hoop MPA is zoned as a restricted area (no-take zone). =Boundaries= *The northern boundary is the high water mark *The eastern boundary is a line at 114¬∞ true bearing from a beacon near Stilbaai Point at S34¬∞27.13'; E020¬∞052.25' *The western boundary is a line at 150¬∞ true bearing from a beacon between Rys Point and Skipskop at S34¬∞34.94'; E020¬∞21.89' *The seaward (southern) boundary is a series of straight lines joining the following points in sequence, which are all approximately three nautical miles from the shore: **S34¬∞28.378'; E020¬∞55.653' **S34¬∞28.385'; E020¬∞55.397' **S34¬∞30.378'; E020¬∞53.904' **S34¬∞31.295'; E020¬∞51.277' **S34¬∞31.088'; E020¬∞48.865' **S34¬∞30.416'; E020¬∞45.593' **S34¬∞29.850'; E020¬∞41.128' **S34¬∞30.438'; E020¬∞34.900' **S34¬∞32.329'; E020¬∞29.699' **S34¬∞37.600'; E020¬∞23.757' Restricted areas The whole MPA is a restricted area. Management The marine protected areas of South Africa are the responsibility of the national government, which has management agreements with a variety of MPA management authorities, in this case, the MPA is adjacent to the De Hoop Nature Reserve and is managed by CapeNature with funding from the SA Government through the Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA). The Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries is responsible for issuing permits, quotas and law enforcement. Geography =General topography= =Geology= =Hydrography= =Bathymetry= =Climate of the South-western Cape= The climate of the South-western Cape is markedly different from the rest of South Africa, which is a summer rainfall region, receiving most of its rainfall during the summer months of December to February. The South-western Cape has a Mediterranean type climate, with most of its rainfall during the winter months from June to September. During the summer the dominant factor determining the weather in the region is a high pressure zone, known as the South Atlantic High, located over the South Atlantic ocean to the west of the Cape coast. Winds circulating in an anticlockwise direction from such a system reach the Cape from the south-east, producing periods of up to several days of high winds and mostly clear skies. These winds keep the region relatively cool. Because of its south facing aspect De Hoop is exposed to these winds. Winter in the South-western Cape is characterised by disturbances in the circumpolar westerly winds, resulting in a series of eastward moving depressions. These bring cool cloudy weather and rain from the north west. The south westerly winds over the South Atlantic produce the prevailing south-westerly swell typical of the winter months, which beat on the exposed coastline. =Sea conditions= Ecology Marine ecoregions of the South African Exclusive Economic Zone: De Hoop Marine Protected Area is in the Agulhas ecoregion The MPA is in the warm temperate Agulhas ecoregion to the east of Cape Point which extends eastwards to the Mbashe River. There are a large proportion of species endemic to South Africa along this coastline. Four major habitats exist in the sea in this region, distinguished by the nature of the substrate. The substrate, or base material, is important in that it provides a base to which an organism can anchor itself, which is vitally important for those organisms which need to stay in one particular kind of place. Rocky shores and reefs provide a firm fixed substrate for the attachment of plants and animals. Some of these may have Kelp forests, which reduce the effect of waves and provide food and shelter for an extended range of organisms. Sandy beaches and bottoms are a relatively unstable substrate and cannot anchor kelp or many of the other benthic organisms. Finally there is open water, above the substrate and clear of the kelp forest, where the organisms must drift or swim. Mixed habitats are also frequently found, which are a combination of those mentioned above. There are no significant estuarine habitats in the MPA. Rocky shores and reefs There are rocky reefs and mixed rocky and sandy bottoms. For many marine organisms the substrate is another type of marine organism, and it is common for several layers to co-exist. Examples of this are red bait pods, which are usually encrusted with sponges, ascidians, bryozoans, anemones, and gastropods, and abalone, which are usually covered by similar seaweeds to those found on the surrounding rocks, usually with a variety of other organisms living on the seaweeds. The type of rock of the reef is of some importance, as it influences the range of possibilities for the local topography, which in turn influences the range of habitats provided, and therefore the diversity of inhabitants. Sandstone and other sedimentary rocks erode and weather very differently, and depending on the direction of dip and strike, and steepness of the dip, may produce reefs which are relatively flat to very high profile and full of small crevices. These features may be at varying angles to the shoreline and wave fronts. There are fewer large holes, tunnels and crevices in sandstone reefs, but often many deep but low near-horizontal crevices. Kelp forests Kelp forests are a variation of rocky reefs, as the kelp requires a fairly strong and stable substrate which can withstand the loads of repeated waves dragging on the kelp plants. The Sea bamboo Ecklonia maxima grows in water which is shallow enough to allow it to reach to the surface with its gas-filled stipes, so that the fronds form a dense layer at or just below the surface, depending on the tide. The shorter Split-fan kelp Laminaria pallida grows mostly on deeper reefs, where there is not so much competition from the sea bamboo. Both these kelp species provide food and shelter for a variety of other organisms, particularly the Sea bamboo, which is a base for a wide range of epiphytes, which in turn provide food and shelter for more organisms. Sandy beaches and bottoms (including shelly, pebble and gravel bottoms) Sandy bottoms at first glance appear to be fairly barren areas, as they lack the stability to support many of the spectacular reef based species, and the variety of large organisms is relatively low. The sand is continually being moved around by wave action, to a greater or lesser degree depending on weather conditions and exposure of the area. This means that sessile organisms must be specifically adapted to areas of relatively loose substrate to thrive in them, and the variety of species found on a sandy or gravel bottom will depend on all these factors. Sandy bottoms have one important compensation for their instability, animals can burrow into the sand and move up and down within its layers, which can provide feeding opportunities and protection from predation. Other species can dig themselves holes in which to shelter, or may feed by filtering water drawn through the tunnel, or by extending body parts adapted to this function into the water above the sand. The open sea =Seasonal variations in sea conditions= =Marine species diversity= Animals The MPA provides a protected habitat for economically important territorial reef fish, particularly galjoen, blacktail (Diplodus capensis), black musselcracker, white musselcracker and wildeperd (Diplodus hottentotus). Seaweeds Endemism The MPA is in the warm temperate Agulhas ecoregion to the east of Cape Point which extends eastwards to the Mbashe River. There are a large proportion of species endemic to South Africa along this coastline.

She performed at various theatres, especially Covent Garden Theatre, the Theatre Royal, Dublin, the Theatre Royal, Edinburgh, the Theatre Royal Haymarket and Shrewsbury Theatre. She performed in all or most of the Shakespearean comedies, and in several tragedies, besides many contemporary comedy plays. She played the part of Hamlet at least twice. She was considered a beauty when young, and her talent was praised. She married George Bulkley and later Captain Ebenezer Barresford, and openly took several lovers. Her early career was successful, but later she was hissed on stage due to her extra-marital affairs, and she died in poverty. Background Mary Bulkley (1776) Her father was Edward Wilford (d. 1789), an official and treasurer at the Covent Garden Theatre. Because her uncle by marriage John Rich owned the theatre, Mary grew up \\"in some comfort\\" in a theatrical environment. By the time she was nineteen or twenty years old, she was beautiful, but \\"could not sing\\".This contains a quotation from Oliver Goldsmith, related here: Hugh Kelly described her: Blest with a person wholly without fault; Tho' polish'd, gay, and natural, though taught, See where that Wilford elegantly moves, Leads up the graces, and commands the loves. (Thespis II (1767)) In the same year, the following poem was anonymously dedicated to her in a newspaper: How various are the shapes she wears How lovely she's in all! Applauding multitudes she chears, Admirers hopeless fall. ... Yet (blessings on the pious care That rear's the tender frame) One here hath claim to all that share And Wilford is her name. = Marriages and affairs = Mrs Bulkley (1777) On 9 (or 16) August 1767 at Chelsea,Stamford Mercury, Thursday 20 August 1767 p2 col2: On Sunday last when she was about twenty years old, she married George Jackson Bulkley (1742‚Äì1784) in Haymarket. He was a Covent Garden orchestra violinist from Yorkshire. George Bulkley was \\"grateful\\" and \\"useful\\", but \\"dull.\\" Mary had at least three children, all born during her affair with singer and comedy actor James William Dodd (c. 1740 ‚Äì 1796). The first was Mary Elizabeth Bulkley (1768‚Äì1859), baptised on 9 November 1768 at St Paul Covent Garden.England births and baptisms 1538‚Äì1975 ODM P00157-1/845241 The second was George Wilford Bulkley (1769‚Äì1844), Deaths Sep 1844 Bulkley George Wilford Greenwich 5 172 a Newbury and London solicitor.

He died in 1810 in Guadeloupe.(IGI) Following the affair with Dodd at the King Street Theatre, Bristol, in 1768, there was a scandal. Dodd's wife died after about a year, and public sympathy waned as a result. Nevertheless, Mary went with Dodd to Dublin in 1774, but had poor reviews because \\"Some recent transactions had excited strong prejudices against them.\\" This left Dodd and Mary without money, so for a while she went home to her husband. However she went to live again with Dodd, and worked successfully in 1779 with Tate Wilkinson, manager of the Yorkshire Circuit. In due course there was a scandal involving Mary's affairs when she went to live with harlequin John Banks in Scotland, and with actor John (or James) Brown Williamson (d. 1802) around 1782. Having become a widow in 1784, she married Captain Ebenezer Barresford on 22 July 1788,Hereford Journal, Thursday 31 July 1788 p3 col4: Married, Capt Eben Barresford in the east country trade, to Mr Bulkley, late of Covent Garden but by 1791 she was \\"drinking heavily.\\" Her carriage, overturning on Edinburgh's North Bridge in 1785, caused \\"hurt,\\" preventing her from performing the following night.Caledonian Mercury, Monday 10 January 1785 p3 col2: Edinburgh That injury may also have contributed to the increase in her drinking. She became \\"old ‚Äì sickly ‚Äì and with a very red face.\\" On 19 September 1792, at the age of forty-four, she died in \\"wretched pecuniary circumstances\\" in Dumfries, where she was buried in St Michael's churchyard, \\"not far from where Burns lies.\\" Career Mrs Bulkley (1776) Mary was a member of the Covent Garden theatre company between 1761 and 1780 or 1781, however her Covent Garden debut in 1758 at the age of ten years was as a dancer. She continued as a dancer there until 1765, when at around 18 years old she first performed as a comedy actress. In 1769 she was involved in a horsemanship display, assisting Mr Hyam who \\"would drink a glass of wine standing upright on two horses at full speed.\\"Manchester Mercury, Tuesday 06 June 1769 p4 col3: Horsemanship, Mr Hyam and Mrs Bulkley During her career, Mary performed in many plays and only some of them are listed below. Her debut as a comedian was at Covent Garden, as Miranda in The Busie Body, by Susanna Centlivre (1709). At the same theatre she performed in the premi√®res of several plays which are now well known. For example, The Good-Natur'd Man (as Miss Richland, 1768), She Stoops to Conquer (as Constantia Hardcastle, 1773), and The Rivals (as Julia Melville, 1775). Although eighteenth-century scholars took care to preserve the accuracy of printed versions of Shakespeare's plays, those plays were heavily edited for performance, to suit contemporary language and taste. In that environment, Mary performed in all the Shakespeare comedies, but also played the tragic heroine Cordelia in King Lear, and Portia in The Merchant of Venice. =At Covent Garden= Covent Garden playbill (1779) In 1773, the premi√®re of She Stoops to Conquer by Goldsmith was received at Covent Garden with \\"great applause,\\" being the \\"only new comedy that had appeared in (the) theatre for some years.\\" Mary Bulkley played Miss Hardcastle and performed the epilogue, but Hardcastle's song, The Humours of Ballamagairy was omitted because Bulkley could not sing.Leeds Intelligencer, Tuesday 23 March 1773 p4 col3: Theatrical intelligence, She Stoops to Conquer at Covent GardenThe Stage ‚Äì Friday 18 July 1884 p17 col3 and p18 col1: She Stoops to Conquer Present at rehearsals for this premi√®re were Oliver Goldsmith, Samuel Johnson and Joshua Reynolds. There was an onstage argument between Mary Bulkley and Ann Catley about who should perform the epilogue, and Goldsmith even suggested rewriting it so that they should perform it together, quarrelling in character, but the owner-director George Colman decided that Bulkley should perform it.Illustrated London News, Saturday 31 October 1896 p8 col2-3: Chapter XII =Performing with Dodd in Dublin and Shrewsbury= James William Dodd (1779) On 29 May 1774 Mary arrived with her lover Dodd in Dublin.Saunders's News-Letter, Monday 30 May 1774 p1 col3: Dublin, June 1st, New garden Her first engagement was to play Beatrice in Much Ado About Nothing at the Theatre Royal, Dublin. This play was billed as a \\"revival\\" in the Sanders's News-Letter.

She interrupted a performance of the Merchant of Venice, in which she was playing Portia, to respond onstage that, \\"as an actress she had always done her best to oblige the Public; and as to her private character, she begged to be excused‚Äù. Her career began to decline after this, and she appeared at Covent Garden less frequently. During the 1783‚Äì1784 season she was again hissed onstage, due to audience disapproval of her affairs. Nevertheless, for most of her career her beauty and talent outbalanced her disfavour with moralists, and earned her \\"poems of praise.\\" =Performing with John Banks in Edinburgh= It was perhaps around 1781 that she arrived in Edinburgh with John Banks. When Williamson arrived the same year and took her attention, Banks challenged Williamson and struck him in the dressing room, with no effect on Bulkley's affections. =Performing with Williamson in Edinburgh= Mrs Bulkley (1785) The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography says that \\"public disapproval followed Mary to Scotland,\\" but she did not seem to give up. However, on her arrival in January 1782 a spat with the acting manager of the Theatre Royal, Edinburgh, Jackson, about which parts she should take, occasioned a long letter to the Caledonian Mercury, requesting public support.Caledonian Mercury, Wednesday 30 January 1782 p3 col2: Letter from M.

Since 1988 it has been a cultural asset worthy of protection within the meaning of Article 1 of the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict.  History  = Historical background of the church building and its sister church Heiliggeistkirche = In 1689, the town of Speyer was destroyed by order of Louis XIV of France in the Nine Years' War. Since the Reformation, its citizens had been predominantly Lutherans and, to a lesser extent, Reformed Christians. The inhabitants fled via the Rhine, many of them to Frankfurt, as the whole Electoral Palatinate was also destroyed between Speyer and Heidelberg. Only ten years later, in 1698, did some of the inhabitants return. The small Reformed congregation began the first new church building, the Heiliggeistkirche (Church of the Holy Spirit), in 1700-1702. In the winter of 1700/01, the Lutheran congregation cleared away the ruins of the 1689 destruction. The foundation work began in April, so that the foundation stone for the Trinity Church was laid on 22 April 1701. A few days later, the city council laid a second foundation stone, which was accompanied by the Lutheran Church Order of 1700 and the Augsburg Confession of 1530, as well as a pewter tablet stating that \\"after the barbaric destruction of the city by Gallic hands, this church was built for the glory of God and to adorn the city\\". = Construction Period = The foundation of the Trinity Church was laid in 1701 by the master builder Johann Peter Graber. The brickwork was built between 1701 and 1703 by the Italian master bricklayer Paul Bagnato, who in German called himself \\"Paul Na√ü\\". In autumn 1703 the War of the Spanish Succession threatened the city of Speyer. Therefore, it was decided on 17 October 1703 to move the services of the Lutheran congregation from the Gottesackerkirche (cemetery church) in front of the town gates to the still unfinished Dreifaltigkeitskirche within the town walls. From 1704 the construction of wooden galleries began. However, the construction work inside the church continued until 1717 due to lack of money. The organ was commissioned from the Mainz organ builder Johann Anton Ignaz Will in 1715 and was installed at the beginning of 1717. On 31 October 1717, the day of the 200th anniversary of the Reformation, the Trinity Church was solemnly inaugurated. = French Revolution = In 1792 Speyer was conquered by French revolutionary troops. On the second day of Christmas 1793 the last service took place in the Trinity Church. Then the church was plundered, the church vessels had to be delivered, the bells and organ pipes were removed, so that the building finally no longer contained any metal. In the final phase of Napoleonic military campaigns, the church was used as a military hospital for wounded soldiers, and only from 1814 did church services resume. = Church union = Already in the second half of the 18th century the first rapprochements between Reformed and Lutherans took place. Experiences during the French Revolution reinforced the rapprochement. On 31 October 1817 the Reformed congregation in Speyer decided to rename its church \\"Church of the Holy Spirit\\". From then on the church served the united Protestant community.Evangelische Kirche der Pfalz, Landeskirchenrat: Heiliggeistkirche Speyer., Abschnitt: ... und der reformierten Gemeinde in Speyer This happened one year before the actual Union of Churches in the Palatinate. In a survey of about 130,000 Reformed and 108,000 Lutheran Protestants in the parishes of the Palatinate, 40,167 voted for the Union, only 539 against. In the Palatinate, a general synod of Lutheran and Reformed congregations met in Kaiserslautern from 16 August 1818 to determine a common creed. On 1 Advent 1818 (29 November 1818) a union was formed, which was celebrated with a solemn joint divine service. Until the completion of the Ged√§chtniskirche (Memorial Church) in 1904, the Trinity Church remained the main Protestant church in Speyer. From 1904 the church services took place only during the winter half-year in the Trinity Church, because the Ged√§chtniskirche was not heated in winter until 1965 and therefore served only as a summer church. In 1979 regular church services were stopped in the Heiliggeistkirche. The church services regularly take place only in the Trinity Church.Timm Herre und dpa: Heiliggeistkirche zu verkaufen, in morgenweb.de vom Mittwoch, 22. Mai 2013; abgerufen am 8. M√§rz 2014  Architecture  Interior view The Dreifaltigkeitskirche in Speyer is a baroque building and goes back directly to the St. Catherine's Church in Frankfurt, which was built between 1678 and 1680 by Melchior He√üler. It was built between 1701 and 1717. The master builder was the Mannheim architect Johann Peter Graber. The church is regarded as an \\"outstanding achievement of Protestant church architecture and a jewel of the Baroque\\". The church faces northeast. The roomy hall has a choir end with five sides of a decagon. The walls are unstructured because of the galleries. The wooden ceiling has a very flat cap vault over semicircular shield arches. The fa√ßade is no longer original, as under the French occupation in 1794 the five stone figures were overthrown from the gable of the fa√ßade. The current fa√ßade gable was redesigned in 1891 according to the plans of the Speyer architect Heinrich Jester. The interior of the church is entirely from the time of its construction. The ceiling paintings are based on medieval forms of representation. They are all conceived like panel paintings. There is evidence that 20 scenes date back to the picture bible of Matthew Merian. The illustrations of the church scenes serve the understanding and the spreading of the word of God, completely in the sense of the Lutheran faith. In contrast to the usual Baroque ceiling paintings, the paintings are not aligned with a line of sight.  Organ  Organ above the altar The organ of the Trinity Church is located above the altar in the historical prospectus built by Christian Dathan around 1716 for the first organ of the church. The instrument was built in 1929 by the organ building company Steinmeyer (Oettingen), using pipe material from the predecessor organ from 1812, which had been built by Johann Georg Geib (Frankenthal). Today the organ has 41 stops, divided into three manuals and pedal. The instrument has electropneumatic tracker action.  Bell tower  Bell tower The so-called L√§utturm (bell tower) belonged to the medieval St. Georgen Church, of which nothing has survived. Between 1689 and 1822 the tower remained only as a stump. In 1818, the Sprinkhorn et Schrader foundry in Frankenthal cast a three-voiced bell that proved to be too large for the ridge turret of the Trinity Church built in 1717. Threfore, the bell tower was rebuilt to accommodate the new bell. On July 2, 1891, the tower burned including the clock and bells. In the same year Andreas Hamm poured a new bell from Frankenthal with the tones of the C minor triad (c1, es1 and g1), which were thus tuned to the bell of the cathedral. They bore the inscriptions \\"God's Word Remains for Eternity\\", \\"There Is Still Rest in the People of God\\" and \\"Rejoice in the Lord All Ways\\". First they were hung up in a bell house on the church garden and after the reconstruction of the bell tower they had to be ringable; in 1917 the bells had to be collected for war purposes. This was followed in 1924 by three bells from the same foundry, this time in the tones c1 (emergency bell), es1 (faith bell) and f1 (sky bell). In the Second World War, this bell was destroyed.Theo Fehn: Der Glockenexperte. Vom Neuaufbau des deutschen Glockenwesens aus der Sicht von Theo Fehn. Badenia, Karlsruhe 1991, Bd. 1, S. 32+34, . Since 1951, the Vaterunserglocke (Lord's Prayer bell) has hung in clay b1 in the ridge turret of the Dreifaltigkeitskirche itself; it was cast by Friedrich Wilhelm Schilling. In 1964, the Karlsruher Glocken- und Kunstgie√üerei cast three bells for the bell tower with the same striking tones as the first bell (C minor triad).

Historically in Westmorland, the area lies within the modern county of Cumbria and is bounded by the Lake District to the west, the Eden Valley to the north and east, and the Yorkshire Dales and Howgill Fells to the south. The area mostly falls within the boundaries of the Yorkshire Dales National Park while a small part of the western fells is in the Lake District National Park. The fells are one of 159 National Character Areas defined by Natural England. Limestone pavement on Orton Scar, Cumbria, EnglandMost settlements are in the lower land of the central upland region and the area is bounded by the villages of Orton, Great Asby, Little Asby, Crosby Ravensworth and Crosby Garret. Other settlements in the area include Ravenstonedale, Soulby, Maulds Meaburn, Kings Meaburn, Morland, and Cliburn, and many of the settlements have conservation area status. Abrasion by glaciers and natural weathering of the limestone has created deep fissures, breaking the pavement into blocks, most of which was damaged by mining over the centuries.

The rolling hills contain improved pasture with limestone walls or fences with some hedgerows and farming in the area is usually sheep with some other livestock while grass is grown for hay and silage in the valleys. Heather is found on the moorland and tree cover is mostly sparse except in small groups with a mix of broad-leaved and coniferous trees, with Ash trees being quite common. Archaeological remains are located in the area and include ancient villages, stone circles, burial mounds and a Roman road.

The director of the IOPNAP, physicist Yan Jici (Ny Tsi-Ze), was appointed director of the new institution after the merger was completed in 1950. The new entity was named the Institute of Applied Physics before being renamed to Institute of Physics in 1958. In Taiwan, the IOPAS was re-established in Taipei in 1962 by another \\"founding father\\" of modern Chinese physics - Wu Ta-You. Claiming the same root, a partnership agreement between the IOPCAS in Mainland China and IOPAS in Taiwan was signed by their directors during the celebration of their 80th anniversary of foundation amid a warming trend in cross-strait relations of the time. However, in 2018, the two IOPs celebrated their 90th anniversary of foundation without announcing any further cooperation. By the end of 2017, the IOPCAS counted 346 of scientific research, 127 of technical support, with research activities on condensed matter physics, optical physics, atomic and molecular physics, plasma physics, soft matter physics, and condensed matter theory and computation physics. 14 academicians of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and 1 academician of Chinese Academy of Engineering had been elected from the IOPCAS. Besides Ny Tsi-Ze and Wu Ta-You, several Chinese prominent scientists have also worked at IOPCAS or one of its predecessors, Wu Youxun (Y. H. Woo), Zhao Zhongyao (Chung-Yao Chao), Qian Sanqiang (Tsien San-Tsiang), among others. Three Chinese state key laboratories are now under IOPCAS. They are the National Lab for Superconductivity established in 1991, the State Key Laboratory of Magnetism opened in 1990 and the State Key Laboratory of Surface Physics founded in 1987. In addition, a series of CAS key labs in the fields such as Optical Physics, Extreme Conditions Physics, Electron Microscopy, etc. are also built in IOPCAS. The IOPCAS established partnership with institutions and universities of over 30 countries, such as Stanford University (US), University of California, Berkeley (US), the Royal Society of London (UK), Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS, France), Max Planck Society (Germany), Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, among many others. By 2018, the IOPCAS receives in average 500 in-coming visits per year, while the out-going visits are around 700 per year. The IOPCAS is the major sponsor of Chinese Physical Society (CPS), a nongovernmental organization which can find its roots in 1932, today officially affiliated to the China Association for Science and Technology.

Nearby areas include Jebel Jassassiyeh to the immediate west and Ras Laffan to the east. Etymology The town's name comes from the Arabic word \\"tahawala\\", which is translated as \\"to divert\\". This name was earned due to the area's low elevation which allowed it to divert the flow of water from a nearby valley. History Ottoman records make the earliest known mention of Al Huwaila in 1555. The records state that, at that time, the Qatar Peninsula was ruled by Mohammed bin Sultan bani Muslim of the Al- Musallami tribe and that he had his seat of power in Al Huwaila. In the 1820s, George Barnes Brucks carried out the first British survey of the Persian Gulf.

The research center is located in Tbilisi, Kakheti highway. The Lugar Research Center came to the attention of the public since 2017, after various instances of the Russian authorities criticized the center's activities and accused the spread of illnesses that are supported by the US government. History Since the Soviet period, there have been various profile Labs in Georgia, such as \\"Anti-Black Death Georgian Station\\", which is located in Saburtalo district of Tbilisi, which is now the \\"National Center for Disease Control and Public Health\\", where almost 70 years were working on dangerous pathogens. Yet another such agency was a \\"Tabakhmela biochemical plant\\", which was producing vaccines, but according to a secret plan, it was able to carry out a working process within 24 hours and launch the biological weapons components. The construction of the current center was launched in 2004, after the US Government and the Government of Georgia signed between the US Department of Defense and the Ministry of Defense of Georgia. The full name of the Agreement was \\"Cooperation in the field of prevention of the introduction of pathogenesis and experience related to biological weapons development\\". The US government did not want the Soviet period scientists working on the biological weapons, would get to such countries of the world as Iran or North Korea, as well as they didn't want to be issued from Georgia biological weapons-related technologies and securely protected from all of the pathogen, which for decades kept in Georgia. The Lugar Research Center was opened in 2011, but it was fully exploited from August 2013. Lugar Research Center is the highest level institution of laboratory network of country, which is a public health system referral laboratory. The above-mentioned agreement has been implemented in the field of human and animal health and biosafety, by which in the last 13 years by the financial and technical assistance program, total cost of which is approximately 350 million USD in 2018. Within the framework of this program, the biosafety laboratory network equipped with modern equipments, was designed to diagnose pathogens causing human and animal hazardous diseases. The Lugar Research Center is fully passed on Government of Georgia, and since 2018 the Government of Georgia provides full funding for Lugar Research Center and Laboratory Network. The Center played a key role as a diagnostic facility during the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Georgia.

Designed to the same specifications issued by the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (RLM) which led to the Focke-Wulf Ta 400 and Junkers Ju 390, its development was cancelled by the RLM. Design and development In March 1941 the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (ministry of the air, abbreviated RLM), the ministry that during the Nazi period was responsible for the whole aviation of Germany, expressed the need to acquire a new long-range bombardment aircraft capable of carrying a war load of 5,000 kg of bombs with a range of 15,000 km. Focke-Wulf and Junkers responded to the request by starting a project for a large tactical bomber suitable to meet the specifications issued. Focke-Wulf planned the development of an all- encompassing four-engine aircraft in a trailing configuration that could be equipped with the best engines currently being developed, the BMW 803 of 3 900 PS combined with four-bladed propellers counter-rotating or Junkers Jumo 222. The long fuselage integrated the cockpit pressurized for the five (or according to other sources ten) crew members on the front, the ventral bomb compartment and an empennage bi drift chosen to improve the shooting range of the two barbette hydraulically driven backbones equipped with a pair of cannoncini automatic MG 151/20 gauge 20 mm. To these were two other identical barbette and, optional for the antinave configuration, a gondola equipped with 4 cannons MK 108 caliber 30 mm. The landing gear chosen re-proposes a classic configuration, with the two front axle springs cushioned and equipped with twin wheel integrated by a third rotated element placed near the tail. In addition to the three planned versions, the first two (A and B) equipped with the four supermotors and a third, the Fw 238 C, which had to make up for the impossibility of being equipped with the BMW 803 and Jumo 222 still too fragile (and that failed never to overcome the reliability problems encountered) with six more traditional and reliable 12 inverted V cylinders chosen from Daimler-Benz DB 603 or Junkers Jumo 213, there was one development for a small four-engine version, equipped with radial BMW 801 D, with a length of 30.6 m by 5.8 m height with a 50 m opening wing and a surface area of 240 m¬≤. In reality none of the versions passed the phase design and their development, which according to some estimates could have been realized at least in a prototype able to fly by the end of 1944, was definitively interrupted for an order dated 14 February 1943 in which the RLM required companies to devote themselves as a priority to the development of models to be used in the air defense of the German territory.

Sadolin passed the preliminary exams at the University of Copenhagen in 1890 and then worked for half a year in a mechanical workshop. He had aspirations to become an artist and therefore studied at Copenhagen Technical School, the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts and Kristian Zahrtmann's art school in 1890‚Äì96. He was considered a promising student but temporary visual impairment led him into the theoretical and practical study of dyes. Burial finds in Egypt had recently brought attention to encaustic paintings, and this inspired him to conduct a series experiments successful with wax-based dyes. In 1907, he established a small business, Gunnar A. Sadolins Farvefabrik (paint factory), with funding from his brothers Frode Sadolin and J√∏rgen Theophilus Sadolin and the physician Olav H√∏gsbro, who each invested DKK 100 in the venture. The production took place in a single room in Fasang√•rden with Sadolin's fianc√© and later wife as the only employee. On 18 May 1909, A/S Sadolin's Farver (Sadolin's Paints) was founded with merchant Gustav Hage (1852‚Äì1935) and engineer Alexander Foss (an uncle of Sadolin's fianc√©) as the largest stakeholders. On 2 July 1912, the company merged with Holmblad & Co.s Eftf. under the name Sadolin & Holmblad. From 1914 Sadolin served as chief technical officer (teknisk direkt√∏r) of the company while his brother Knud Sadolin served as chief commercial officer (merkantil direkt√∏r) for the company. The product range was constantly expanded and A/S Kemisk V√¶rk in K√∏ge was established as a manufacturer of dry pigments and aniline dyes. Gunnar Asgeir Sadolin and Knud Sadolin both retired in 1949 and were succeeded as directors by Gunnar Asgeir Sadolin's son Dan Alexander MacGregor Sadolin (21 July 1914 ‚Äì 02 January 2000) and son-in-law Kaj Ege√∏ Poulsen (1912-1993) and Knud Sadolin's son-in-law Orla Christian Greisen (1914-1994).

They are in the collection of the Suermondt- Ludwig-Museum, Aachen, Germany, where they are hung alongside each other. The panels portray Jesus and Virgin Mary in the moments before his Crucifixion, and are infused with senses of physical and mental suffering. Jesus is scourged, and captured at the moment shortly before his Crucifixion where he is brought before the hostile crowd to be judged.

Biography He was born to a family of farmers in Taichung as Huang Tsuen-tao (). He traveled to Japan in 1941, seeking admission to medical school. Instead, the next year, aged 16, Huang enlisted in the Imperial Japanese Navy to prove that Taiwanese could be just as capable as Japanese despite discrimination. He was assigned to the transportation division. During Huang's first military action, an unsuccessful sea rescue, his lifeboat capsized. He was later stationed on Hainan. At the end of the Second Sino‚ÄìJapanese War, Japanese prisoners of war were permitted to return home, but Taiwanese prisoners of war remained in camps on Hainan. Huang soon escaped and traveled to Haikou, where he ran a small business. Huang escaped the island entirely in May 1946. After a month of sailing the Taiwan Strait, Huang and a group of Taiwanese landed in Chiayi. He settled in Taichung. The Ailan Bridge (pictured 2014) was later built on the site of the Battle of Wuniulan The 228 Incident broke out on 28 February 1947. By the next day, the violence had reached Taichung. Huang witnessed Kuomintang forces killing civilians in front of the Taichung Hotel. Huang subsequently joined Hsieh Hsueh-hung's Independent Security Brigade. He was the only group member with military experience. The Independent Security Brigade merged with others and was renamed the 27 Brigade on 6 March 1947. Hsieh remained leader of the reconstituted force, while Huang was responsible for its security unit. Kuomintang forces reached Puli on 13 March. The 27 Brigade sent out a small force to raid the KMT position at Sun Moon Lake, and, led by Huang, formally engaged the Kuomintang on 16 March in the . Hsieh elected to end the resistance upon learning that the brigade's headquarters at the Puli had fallen. Following the end of the resistance, Huang Tsuen-tao changed his name to Huang Chin-tao and assumed his brother's identity to work at a tire factory. Huang elected to return to military service, and enlisted in the Republic of China Marine Corps under his new name. He was assigned to the Armor Training Command. During his ROCMC service, Huang was repeatedly jailed and questioned. He was eventually charged with insurgency, jailed for the final time on 1 June 1952, and sentenced to death. Huang's sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment. After the death of Chiang Kai-shek in 1975, Huang was granted parole. Huang and his wife Wang Chao-e were in attendance at the Human Rights Day commemoration on 10 December 1979 that became known as the Kaohsiung Incident. In 1986, Huang became a founding member of the Democratic Progressive Party and was active in the DPP's Taichung chapter. Huang left politics to continue his activism, focused on the continuing democratization of Taiwan and the events of the 228 Incident. He led tours of monuments created to honor the 27 Brigade, many of which he pushed authorities to build. In 2000, the Chen Shui-bian presidential administration gave Huang the Human Rights Award. He died on 8 January 2019, and at his funeral on 21 January 2019, was posthumously awarded a presidential citation.

About MUNUC  The Model United Nations of the University of Chicago is a collegiate Model UN organization of undergraduates at the University of Chicago, founded in 1988. For thirty-two years, the organization has hosted an annual conference (MUNUC) for high school students across the United States and the world. At MUNUC, high school students assume the roles of member states of the United Nations or government officials of various international and national bodies, crafting and debating policies to solve a variety of political, social, and economic global issues. The 33rd session will feature six categories of thirty-three total committees. = General Assemblies = In General Assemblies, delegates act as representatives of member states of the United Nations to draft resolutions solving a variety of broad and universal global issues. General Assemblies include all member states, and are often double-delegation, where two individuals represent one member state in committee. The General Assemblies scheduled to convene for the 33rd annual session are- * Disarmament and International Security Committee * Economic and Financial Committee * Social, Humanitarian, and Cultural Committee * Special Political and Decolonization Committee * Administrative and Budgetary Committee * Legal Committeehttps://munuc.org/committees/#general-assembly-ga = Economic and Social Councils = The Economic and Social Councils include various specialized United Nations agencies. In contrast to General Assemblies, the Economic and Social Councils feature select member states and generally discuss more specific, in-depth aspects of international humanitarian issues. The Economic and Social Councils scheduled to convene for the 33rd annual session are- * Special Meetings on Emergency Situations * United Nations Environmental Programme * United Nations Human Rights Committee * United Nations World Tourism Organization * United Nations Development Program = Regional Bodies = The Regional Bodies encompass both past and present international supranational or sub-national organizations separate from the United Nations, discussing issues prevalent in their respective geographical or geopolitical regions. The Regional Bodies scheduled to convene for the 33rd annual session are: * European Union 1999 * African Union * Pacific Islands Forum * Arab League * Organization of American States = Specialized Agencies = The Specialized Agencies are often legally binding organizations, discussing or reporting in-depth international and domestic political topics. In some committees, delegates represent individual characters or representatives of private organizations rather than countries. The Specialized Agencies scheduled to convene for the 31st annual session are- * United Nations Security Council * International Civil Aviation Organization * Council of the Antarctic Treaty * International Criminal Police Organization * Press Corps * The United States Senate = Continuous Crisis = Continuous crisis committees simulate historical governing bodies all over the world. Their smaller size allows delegates to speak frequently, and debate moves quickly between topics. Committees with crisis components are differentiated from non-crisis committees in that delegates represent individuals who has personal powers that can be used to further a personal agenda without the knowledge or approval of the rest of committee. MUNUC staffers provide updates on how the actions of individual delegates, and the committee as a whole, are affecting the simulated world of committee.

Both began their careers as actors, but what began as a shared hobby turned into full-time work in running the Mander and Mitchenson Theatre Collection (MMTC) and writing books, reviews and articles on theatre, opera and ballet. The collection remained their private property until 1977, when they handed it over to a trust. After the deaths of the founders the collection was moved first to the Jerwood Library of the Performing Arts in Greenwich, and, in 2010, to the Theatre Collection of the University of Bristol. During the founders' lifetimes the collection contributed illustrations to more than four hundred books, and has remained one of the most important resources for authors writing about history of the British theatre. Biographies =Early years= Raymond Josiah Gale Mander was born in Clapham, London, the only son of Albert Edwin Mander, an architect and surveyor, and his wife, Edith Christina, n√©e Gale. He was educated at Battersea Grammar School and became an actor when he left school, making his debut at Bedford in Harold Neilson's touring Shakespeare company.Rhymes, Rupert (2004). \\"Mander, Raymond Josiah Gale (Ray)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press.

Francis Joseph Blackett Mitchenson was born in Southgate, London, the only son of Francis William Mitchenson, a general merchant, and his wife, Sarah, n√©e Roddam. Unlike Mander's family, which had no special association with the theatre, Mitchenson's had stage connexions on his mother's and his father's side. His father was a part-time drama critic, and his mother was a keen amateur actress. Their marriage broke up when Mitchenson was a boy, and he was brought up by his mother. He was educated privately, and at the age of eight he enrolled at the Fay Compton Studio of Dramatic Art. A fellow student there was Alec Guinness, alongside whom he made his first West End stage appearance, walking on in a drama called Libel! at the Playhouse Theatre.\\"Obituary: Joe Mitchenson\\", The Times, 9 October 1992, p. 17 Mander and Mitchenson met in February 1939, and later in that year they were both cast in a production of The Merry Wives of Windsor, Mander as Master Page and Mitchenson as Fenton. They toured with Neilson's company, playing small roles. During the Second World War Mander worked for the BBC, presenting radio programmes including a series called Actors Remember in which he interviewed veteran performers, such as Walter Passmore reminiscing about Richard D'Oyly Carte, Ada Reeve about George Edwardes, and Leslie Henson about George Grossmith Jr. He also wrote material for other presenters, usually in collaboration with Mitchenson.\\"Raymond Mander\\", BBC Genome.

He resumed his stage career for a few years, before giving up regular acting in 1948. =Collecting= As well as being partners in their private lives, and sometimes appearing in productions together, Mander and Mitchenson shared a passion for collecting theatrical memorabilia. They began their joint collection in 1939,\\"Mander, Raymond Josiah Gale, (15 July 1911‚Äì20 Dec. 1983), Who's Who & Who Was Who, Oxford University Press. Retrieved 19 January 2019 and when on tour in the 1940s they would take every opportunity to add to it. Mitchenson's obituarist in The Times wrote, \\"[They] would raid antique shops and second-hand bookshops in search of anything which carried a morsel of theatrical history. It could be a postcard, or a playbill, a painting or a figurine representing some past performance, or, better still, a discarded costume or prop.\\" Their consuming interest gradually overtook their acting careers. They presented small exhibitions of theatre memorabilia around Britain and collaborated on a series of books, the first of which, Hamlet Through the Ages, was published in 1952. It set the pattern for a further eighteen books, published between then and 1980: brief notes accompanying lavish illustrations (this first book contained 257 plates ranging from the frontispiece to a 1709 edition of the play to Guinness's Hamlet in 1951).Ball, Robert H. \\"Hamlet Through the Ages: A Pictorial Record from 1709\\", Shakespeare Quarterly, Vol. 5, No. 3 (Summer, 1954), pp. 335‚Äì336 The ever-expanding collection was housed in Mitchenson's family house in Sydenham. Their biographer Rupert Rhymes writes: John Gielgud commented in 1968, \\"Mander and Mitchenson are a strange freakish pair ‚Äì no taste but enormous diligence, and they have a remarkable collection of materials of all kinds and are really dedicated collectors ‚Äì middle aged, one rather dandified, the other with a broken nose, looking like a Shaw burglar\\".Gielgud, p. 343 No√´l Coward, who referred to them as \\"Gog and Magog\\",Coward, p. 352 and dubbed them \\"the truffle hounds of the theatre\\",Lesley, p. 361 so trusted their theatrical judgment that he left instructions in his will that after his death his estate should take advice from them, together with Sheridan Morley, on the continuing use of his literary and dramatic works.Hoare, p. 519 Sybil Thorndike, who referred to Mander and Mitchenson as \\"my dear detectives\\", gave them gifts and financial donations, calling their collection \\"the profession's passport to posterity\\".Croall, p. 455 Rhymes writes of Mander and Mitchenson's place in the theatrical scene in London, \\"In the 1960s and 1970s 'Ray and Joe' became a theatrical institution and, dressed in style, invariably held court at first nights, reflecting on previous productions and associated gossip.\\" By the end of the 1970s it was clear that the collection required larger premises, and the eighteenth-century Beckenham Place Park was selected, with the aid of the local authority. The move had scarcely begun when Mander died at Hither Green Hospital, London, on 20 December 1983, aged 72, of bronchopneumonia and emphysema. Mitchenson moved to Beckenham with the collection and lived there until his death in Orpington Hospital, London, on 7 October 1992, aged 81, from renal failure and prostatic hypertrophy. Mander and Mitchenson Theatre Collection In later years Mander and Mitchenson wrote that the collection was founded in 1939 \\"with the aim of covering all aspects of the theatre, opera, and ballet\\", although in its early years it grew haphazardly rather than systematically. Even once it was established and widely-known it remained the private property of Mander and Mitchenson until 1977, when they handed it over to a trust, chaired by Laurence Olivier. Over the years it was expanded by the acquisition of the theatrical portion of the Randall H. New Collection and the library and personal theatre records of John Parker, the long-serving editor of Who's Who in the Theatre. Parker's successor, Freda Gaye, described the MMTC as \\"a veritable museum [which] contains engravings, paintings, souvenirs, photographs, china figures, files of programmes of the London and provincial theatres, and a library of several thousand books.\\" She added that it was used extensively by authors, designers, publishers, the BBC and other television producers.Gaye, p. 1718 From as early as 1944 Mander and Mitchenson felt that their collection might eventually be bequeathed to the nation. At one point they hoped it would be housed at the new National Theatre on the South Bank in London when it opened in the 1970s, but the collection was too large to be accommodated there. The Beckenham site proved financially unsustainable, and in 2001, after a brief period in temporary accommodation ‚Äì a disused cricket pavilion in south London ‚Äì the collection was moved to a new home as part of the Jerwood Library of the Performing Arts in Greenwich. In 2010 it was announced that the trustees had agreed to house the entire collection permanently at the University of Bristol, as part of its extensive theatre archive. There was some controversy about the move from London to Bristol. Rhymes, who was a former chairman of the MMTC Trust, said he was \\"appalled at the prospect of the collection moving out of London away from Theatreland which was Ray and Joe‚Äôs life\\".Woolman, Natalie. \\"Mander and Mitchenson theatre collection to quit London\\", The Stage, 24 November 2010 But the move was backed, and part-funded, by the No√´l Coward Foundation and the Cameron Mackintosh Foundation. Bristol University already had an important theatre archive focusing strongly on provincial and 20th-century British drama; the preponderance of London-centred material from the 18th and 19th centuries in the MMTC was seen as an ideal match, creating the second-biggest collection of British theatre memorabilia. The university made it clear that the collection would be available to everyone: \\"We run ourselves as a public museum, as well as a university archive, so anyone can make an appointment to come and study something from the collection\\".Clensy, David. \\"Inside the vaults of theatre's past\\", Bristol Evening Post, 7 October 2011.

She performed with the Metropolitan Opera in New York City and La Scala in Milan, Italy prior to retiring from performing to raise a family. Early life and education Cundari was born in 1930 in Detroit, Michigan to Frank and Ambrosina Cundari. Her father co-owned and operated Mario's Restaurant in Windsor, Ontario where she attended Dougall Avenue School in addition to taking classes at the Ursuline School of Music. She later attended St. Mary's Academy where here vocal talent was apparent to teachers early on. The school, operated by the Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary, began offering music training in 1864. Cundari went on to continue her studies at Marygrove College in Detroit, graduating with a bachelor of music. In hIn her early 20s, she was awarded a $2,000 Grinnell music scholarship, which allowed to travel to New York City where she continued her studies with conductor Max Rudolf and the New York City Opera. Career Cundari made her debut with the New York City Opera in 1953, performing as the Dew Fairy in Hansel and Gretel. Two years later she was signed as a soprano with the Metropolitan Opera, along with Madelaine Chambers. Her first performance as Barbarina in The Marriage of Figaro on March 1, 1956. Cundari debuted in a lead role with the company on March 19, 1957 as Micaela in a production of Carmen. A reviewer for the New York Times said the role was well suited to her soprano voice calling her performance \\"highly promising.\\" She continued on in the role during a company tour that included a run at Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto, Ontario. In 1958 her performance as Lauretta in Giacomo Puccini's Gianni Schicchi with the Met was reviewed by the paper as delivering a \\"graceful and pretty\\" performance that was in need of \\"a little more assurance\\" despite garnering applause for the aria \\"O mio babbino caro\\". Following her work with the Met, Cundari moved to Italy where she performed with La Scala in Milan and toured throughout Europe. In addition to live performances, Cundari appeared on several recordings including Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 and Mahler's Symphony No. 2 under the direction of conductor and composer Bruno Walter. While in Italy Cundari met opera singer Sergio Pezzetti, whom she married in 1965. Following the birth of their son, Cundari returned to Windsor where she occasionally performed and taught music. Despite multiple requests to perform abroad, Cundari spent the remainder of her life outside of the spotlight. Death and legacy Cundari died January 6, 2005, at the age of 74, in Southfield, Michigan. Although she achieved international recognition in the 1950s and 1960s, her musical career remained largely unrecognized until after her death. Since that time, an opera about the lives of Cundari and photographer Pat Sturn was produced by cellist Nadine Deleury in 2014. Four years later, a crowd-funding campaign to add a memorial plaque to the Windsor mausoleum, where Cundari was laid to rest, was launched by soprano Tara Sievers-Hunt. It resulted in the installation of a bronze plaque featuring roses and crosses at the site of her previously unmarked crypt at Heavenly Rest Cemetery.

It is based on kabbalah in general, and the kabbalah of the Ari in particular. The book was first published by Israel Yaakov Algazi in Izmir in about 1731. The question of the authorship and nature of the book - whether early or late, whether or not the author was a Sabbatean - were once in dispute, and as a result also the attitude towards customs recorded in the book. Sabbateanism and the book Sabbatai Zevi died 54 years before the publication of Hemdat Yamim. The book included songs with the acrostic \\"Natan HaAzati\\", as well as statements known to be attributed to Sabbateans.The cover page of the third edition of the book contains (around the outside) verses which allude to Shabtai Zevi and his messianism. Today, it is agreed by academic scholars that the book consists of a collection, most of which is derived from kabbalistic writings from the Ari's school or other customs and laws which are not sourced on Sabbateanism, from a variety of periods and sources, while omitting the original names.Moshe Fogel, \\"The Sabbatean-ness of the book Hemdat Yamim: A new consideration\\", The dream and its failure, the Sabbatean movement and its offshoots: messianism, Sabbateanism, and Frankism (ed. Rachel Eliur), two volumes, Jerusalem: Department of Jewish thought, Institute for Jewish studies, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 2001, p.365-422The history of Sabbateanism and its place in the life of Jews in the Ottoman Empire, Yaakov Barnai, p.64 and on Earlier, some had thought (following R' Yaakov Emden) that the author of Hemdat Yamim, including its customs, was Nathan of Gaza or another, later, Sabbatean author.On the book Hemdat Yamim (by Yoel Rafel) - discussing the origins of Tu Bishvat, lays out the old disagreement, starting from Yaakov Emden's assertion that the author was Nathan of Gaza, and the disagreement of the professors Moshe Fogel (Hebrew University) who follows the view of Avraham Yaari that the sources are not Sabbatean, versus Boaz Hoss (Ben Gurion University) who follows the view of Gershon Scholem and his student Isaiah Tishby, who wrote four articles arguing that the book consisted of Sabbatean sources.https://web.archive.org/web/20140116083145/http://www.datshe.co.il/konditon/2010/06/17/%D7%AA%D7%A2%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%9E%D7%94-%D7%95%D7%90%D7%99%D7%9F-%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%90-%D7%9C%D7%94/ In Orthodox Judaism there was a vociferous disagreement regarding whether the book was Sabbatean. It became famous with R' Yaakov Emden's protesting of the alleged Sabbateanism of R' Jonathan Eybeschutz, and even more so with the publication of maskil David Kohn's book Even HaToim. Most rabbis distanced themselves from the book, but some Hasidic rabbis adopted its customs, and even studied it, while distancing themselves from parts that were definitively identified with Sabbateanism.The relation of Hasidic greats to the book Hemdat YamimOn the book Hemdat Yamim and the Hasidic greats Authorship The book was first printed in Izmir in 1731-1732, and brought to the printing press by R' Israel Yaakov AlgaziJewish Encyclopedia: Israel Yaakov Algazi, who wrote that he found the manuscript in Safed, without naming the author. In his introduction to the book, he praises it and the greatness of its author, and describes how he acquired the manuscript. R' Yaakov Emden argued that the author was Nathan of Gaza. In 1954, the book \\"Taalumat Sefer\\" by Avraham Yaari was published, which theorized that the author was the judge Binyamin Halevi, a student of the Ari, who lived prior to Shabtai Zevi and Sabbateanism.The mystery of a book - the book Hemdat Yamim, who wrote it, and what was the amount of its influence, Avraham Yaari, Mossad Harav Kook, 1954 In 2008, R' Shlomo Kosovski Shachor published the book \\"Otzar Hemdat Yamim\\", which further established this opinion.Otzar Hemdat Yamim, 2008, Bnei Brak. In the long introduction to one edition of the book, R' Moshe Tzuriel wrote a response to the views which argue against the book.Clarifying the arguments against the author of 'Hemdat Yamim' Yaari, for his part, argued that the poem in Hemdat Yamim with the acrostic \\"Nathan of Gaza\\" was not part of the original body of the book. Gershon Scholem disagreed with this conclusion, arguing that Nathan of Gaza was indeed the author. Historian Meir Benayahu argued that book's author was apparently R' Israel Yaakov Algazi himself. Algazi was the rabbi of the Hida, and the father of R' Yom Tov Algazi, regarding who the question of his Sabbateanism is debated to this day.And the mystery remains, Scholem's article opposing Yaari's opinion Today, academic scholars believe that the book consists of a long compilation of excerpts, with changes of language, of books from various periods, mostly predating Sabbateanism; and that the compiler was R' Yisrael Yaakov Algazi himself. The proof to this is linguistic: phrasing which were changed from the original sources, which are unique to Algazi, recur many times throughout the book; and in the first printed edition of the book, in one of Algazi's notes is found the apparent admission that he himself composed the book. There are still some scholars who believe that some of the customs in the book, as well as the writing of the book, are to be attributed to Algazi or his helpers, or at least that their source is Sabbatean. Content and influence The book is significant in that many of its customs are now widely followed. Its content is widely spread with kabbalistic-style musar and inspirational exhortations. It is one of the sources for customs of Tu Bishvat celebration, and the source for the tikkun of the seventh night of Passover which is practiced on Sephardic communities. In new editions of Hemdat Yamim, at the beginning of the book is printed a list of dozens of now-accepted customs whose only known source is this book. The book has been extensively used primarily by Sephardic rabbis, and various kabbalistic customs in it were accepted by all Jewish communities. Opinion among Hasidim about the book varied. R' Chaim of Volozhin wrote that even if the book was authored by Nathan of Gaza, the book itself contained no objectionable content, and seemingly was written before Nathan developed his Sabbatean views. R' Shlomo Elyashiv described the book as \\"one of the most holy\\".◊°◊§◊® ◊ú◊©◊ù ◊©◊ë◊ï ◊ï◊ê◊ó◊ú◊û◊î, ◊ì◊®◊ï◊©◊ô ◊¢◊ï◊ú◊ù ◊î◊™◊ï◊î◊ï, ◊ë\\"◊ó, ◊ì◊®◊ï◊© ◊ì', ◊¢◊†◊£ ◊õ\\"◊ì ◊°\\"◊ó ◊ë◊ì\\"◊î \\"◊ï◊î◊†◊î A 2003 printing of the book opened with a haskama from R' Ovadiah Yosef, saying that \\"excitement about the holiness of Shabbat and holidays does not enter my heart, except by reading this book of Torah\\". On the other hand, R' Mordechai Eliyahu refused to keep the book in his house ever since reading R' Yehuda Fatiyah's criticisms of the book's author, and wrote that the Ben Ish Hai wrote his book \\"Lashon Hachamim\\" primarily to provide an alternative to Hemdat Yamim.Kol Tzopayich, Behar-Bechukotai 2004 Others, though, have claimed the Ben Ish Hai approved of Hemdat Yamim, bringing as evidence several instances where content from Hemdat Yamim appears in Ben Ish Hai.

It is located at a distance of circa 85 million light years from Earth, which, given its apparent dimensions, means that NGC 3665 is about 85,000 light years across. It was discovered by William Herschel on March 23, 1789.  Characteristics  The central region of NGC 3665 by the Hubble Space Telescope, featuring a dust disk. NGC 3665 is a lenticular galaxy whose disk is characterised by the presence of a circular dust lane. The galaxy has high molecular gas content, as determined by the detection of CO lines. The molecular gas mass in the galaxy is estimated to be 108.91 . The galaxy has a UV excess that indicates the presence of a young stellar population. The total star formation rate in NGC 3665 is estimated to be 1.7 per year. This rate is less than the one expected based on the molecular gas reservoirs of the galaxy. It has been suggested that the compact yet massive bulge of the galaxy has stabilised the cold gas, and thus suppressed star formation. The nucleus of the galaxy is active and hosts a low luminosity transition active galactic nucleus (AGN). The most accepted theory for the energy source of AGNs is the presence of an accretion disk around a supermassive black hole. The mass of the black hole in the centre of NGC 3665 is measured using the rotation of the molecular gas around the nucleus as , or based on the M-sigma relation. NGC 3665 has been found to emit radio waves. Its emission appears elongated at a position angle perpendicular to the dust lane, with the most luminous region being in the nucleus. The emission extends for more than 5 arcminutes in 610 MHz. In 1.4 GHz, the galaxy has one jet with FRI morphology, that extends for more than 3 kpc. In 5 GHz, emission appears in the nucleus and two jet-like structures. The southeast source has not been resolved, while the northwest extends for 0.7 arcseconds, which corresponds to 120 pc at the distance of NGC 3665. The radio emission is likely associated with a low luminosity AGN.  Supernova  One supernova has been detected in NGC 3665, SN 2002hl.List of Supernovae IAU Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams. Retrieved 29 December 2015. It was discovered by T. Boles in unfiltered CCD images taken on November 5, 2002 with a 0.35-m reflector, as part of the U.K. Nova/Supernova Patrol. The supernova had then a magnitude of 16.3. The spectrum of the supernova obtained on November 5 indicated it was a type Ia supernova about one or two months after maximum light.  Nearby galaxies  NGC 3665 is the brightest member of a galaxy group known as the NGC 3665 group. Other members of the group include NGC 3648, NGC 3652, NGC 3658, and UGC 6433.

The event included speeches, prayers, songs, and dance. Its goal was to draw attention to global injustices against indigenous peoples. After prayers outside the Building of Interior Affairs, the marchers proceeded along Constitution Avenue to Henry Bacon Park, north of the Lincoln Memorial. During the day-long event, featured guests, such as Ruth Buffalo, Deb Haaland and Sharice Davids, spoke to crowds gathered on the stairs in front of the Lincoln Memorial and the plaza on the edge of the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool. Organizers expected a crowd of about 10,000 people. Simultaneous \\"solidarity\\" marches were scheduled in a dozen other locations, such as Gallup, New Mexico, and Bemidji, Minnesota, in the United States and Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, in Canada. In late afternoon, when the last group of the March participants were still on the Plaza beside the Reflecting Pool, an incident occurred involving a small group of March participants including Omaha tribe member Nathan Phillips, five Black Hebrew Israelites men, and dozens of Covington Catholic High School teenage students on a school trip arriving at their meeting place after attending the pro-life March for Life rally. In the wake of the widespread sharing of more detailed video clips, media analyses of the videos, and statements, public opinion became polarized, with some claiming the students were completely absolved of all wrongdoing and others saying they were disrespectful of a Native American elder on a day that should have been a celebration of the first Indigenous Peoples' March. Context The goal of the march was to build on the momentum of the 2016‚Äì2017 Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) protests, which had drawn attention to concerns of indigenous peoples globally.The protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline construction, which had been rerouted through the Standing Rock Indian Reservation under Lake Oahe and the Missouri River, began in the spring of 2016 and ended in 2017, but supplemental complaints were still being filed in court in October 2018 the most recent in a list of dozens of litigation documents. One of President Trump‚Äôs first Presidential Memoranda was signed on January 24, 2017, and authorized the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. Presidential Memorandum Regarding Construction of the Dakota Access, which according to a January 24, 2017 BBC article, \\"infuriated environmentalists.\\" The organizers of the \\"grassroots effort\\" included indigenous leaders, tribes, and celebrities, many of whom were part of the Indigenous Peoples Movement. The Indigenous Peoples March which took place the day before the third annual Women‚Äôs March, was a grassroots effort intended to \\"unite indigenous groups globally, not just in the United States, according to The Herald Sun.  Event organizers  The main organizers of the event were Cliff Matias, and Nathalie Farfan Farfan is an Ecuadorian Indigenous woman who co-hosts the Latina feminist podcast Morado Lens and New Jersey-based La Brujas Club spiritual wellness community. Matias is a director of the Redhawk Native American Arts Council in Brooklyn, New York He had previously organized the Standing Rock Protests and New York City area pow-pows and Indigenous Peoples' Day events, and claims heritage in both the Ta√≠no (Puerto Rican) and Quechua (Peruvian) indigenous traditions. Program The march began at the Interior Department, proceeded to the Lincoln Memorial, for an all-day rally, where Indigenous leaders addressed the crowd at the memorial. The evening program consisted of a fundraising concert at the Songbyrd Music House. 500px The event began at 8:00 AM outside the Building of Interior Affairs, which runs the Bureau of Indian Affairs, with opening songs, prayers, and smudging with sage, a ceremony for cleansing \\"our eyes to see clearly, our mouths to speak the truth, and our hearts to spread love.\\" The marchers, who chanted, sang, and drummed, then walked towards the Lincoln Memorial from Constitution Avenue to 17th St. NW and through the National Mall. Featured guests who spoke beside the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool included Ruth Buffalo, a North Dakota Representative and member of the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara Nation, and Paulette Jordan, who had served on the Tribal Council, sovereign government of the Coeur d'Alene people, and as a member of the Idaho House of Representatives from 2014 until 2018 when she ran for governor of Idaho. Deb Haaland and Sharice Davids, the first Native American women elected to Congress, spoke at the March. Haaland was a representative for New Mexico and a member of the Laguna Pueblo tribe; Davids was a Representative for Kansas, and a member of the Ho-Chunk Nation. Indigenous elders continued to speak, sing, and drum even as a concurrent March for Life rally \\"began to overlap the Indigenous Peoples Movement among the stairs of the Lincoln Memorial.\\" The day ended with a round dance on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, with chants of \\"We are still here.\\" =Issues= The goal of the March was to raise public awareness of issues that affect indigenous people worldwide, such as missing and murdered Indigenous women (MMIW), climate change, diabetes and obesity in the Pacific and Indigenous communities, the 2018‚Äì19 United States federal government shutdown, \\"voter suppression in Indian Country\\", families divided by walls and borders, human trafficking including sex trafficking, police brutality against Native Americans, \\"mistreatment of Indigenous peoples at the borders\\", and the need to protect indigenous lands. Marchers carried signs that said, \\"Water is Life\\" (a theme of the Indigenous movement), \\"There is no O'Odham word for wall\\", and \\"We will not be silenced.\\" They also \\"came to bring awareness of the ill-effects of oil pipelines running through Indian Country.\\" =Participants= Lakeland PBS news item on the solidarity march in Bemidji, Minnesota Organizers expected about 10,000 people would attend.

A delegation representing eight tribes from Oklahoma included Reverend David Wilson, a member of the Choctaw Nation and the Oklahoma Indian Missionary Conference superintendent. Wilson said that half of his group were young American Indian Methodists in the group ranging in age from 20 to 32 \\"who are more inclined to work on issues of social justice, more so than other generations....

Late afternoon incident In the late afternoon on January 19, 2019, when two rallies (Indigenous Peoples March and March for Life) taking place that day at the National Mall had ended, an incident occurred at the Lincoln Memorial involving five Black Hebrew Israelites men, Covington Catholic High School teenage students on an annual school trip to attend a pro-life March for Life rally, and Native American marchers. The first short videos of the encounter that were uploaded to Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube received millions of views. A photo of one of the students wearing a MAGA hat standing face-to-face with Nathan Phillips as he beat on a ceremonial drum was published in numerous mass media outlets. The first social media video clips were short and focused on this moment, leading to harsh criticism of the high school students, who some described as mocking and harassing the elder. Some people affiliated with the March described the boys as appearing threatening due to their numbers, actions, and the \\"Make America Great Again\\" caps and clothing that some wore. By the next day, January 20, longer videos had been uploaded, revealing how the encounter had unfolded. Phillips clarified that it was he who had approached the crowd of students, in what he said was an attempt to defuse what Phillips perceived to be a brewing conflict between the students and the group of five men, later identified as Black Hebrew Israelites, who had been taunting the students. Over the next several days, statements from a spokesperson for the March, from an attorney for the Lakota People's Law Project, from Nicholas Sandmann, the student seen in the video standing face to face with Phillips, which was prepared with the help of a publications relations firm hired by his family, and statements from other officials, each offered different perspectives on the incident. In the wake of the widespread sharing of more detailed video clips, media analyses of the videos, and statements, public opinion became polarized, with some saying the students were completely absolved of all wrongdoing and others saying the students were disrespectful of a Native American elder on a day that should have been a celebration of the first Indigenous Peoples March. On the evening of January 19, Phillips led approximately 50 individuals who attempted to gain entrance to the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception while chanting and hitting drums while the Catholics inside celebrated Mass.  Media coverage  The Washington Post described the Indigenous Peoples March as \\"meaningful\\", and an example of how Native Americans will not be silenced. The article drew attention to Donald Trump's joking about the Wounded Knee Massacre to mock the senior United States Senator from Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren.Warren has often been criticized for her claim of Native American ancestry. See Beinart's article in The Atlantic. The Post also wrote in a separate article that the \\"tense encounter in Washington prompted outrage\\". =Defamation law suit= In February 2019, the family of Sandmann sued The Washington Post in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky for $250 million in damages for defamation. Judge William O. Bertelsman ruled to dismiss the case in July 2019, stating that the material published by The Washington Post was opinion protected by the First Amendment. Sandmann's lawyers stated they will appeal this ruling.

The project followed recommendations made by Hugh Segal in consultation with the population, and would test whether \\"Basic Income [would] reduce poverty more effectively, encourage work, reduce stigmatization, and produce better health outcomes and better life chances for recipients\\". It was then implemented in 2018 by the Ontario Liberal Party. However, the project was terminated early by a newly- elected Progressive Conservative government, and the final payments were made to participants in March 2019.  Description  The pilot project aimed to give a fixed income for three years to people with low or no incomes. The communities served by the pilot project included Hamilton, Brantford, Thunder Bay and Lindsay. Participants of the project were randomly selected among residents of the regions aged 18‚Äì64. The financial threshold for inclusion was $34,000 per year for singles or $48,000 per year for couples. About 70% of participants were already employed when entering the program. Single participants received up to $16,989 a year while couples received up to $24,027. If participants also received a paid salary, the amount of basic income would be reduced by 50 cents for every dollar of earned income.\\" Therefore a (single) participant with a salary of $10,000 per year would receive a basic income of $5,000 less ($11,989 per year). Those participants receiving either Employment Insurance or Canada Pension Plan would have their Basic Income reduced on a dollar for dollar basis. Those with disabilities would also receive up to $500 per month on top, but they would withdraw from their participation in the Ontario Works or the Ontario Disability Support Program. Seniors (those of 65 years and above) were not included and they could continue to claim existing benefits. In addition to the 4,000 participants, a comparison group was selected, who would not receive the basic income. However, they would still be asked questions on various issues including their health, work situation and housing. This was to allow researchers to compare the effects of those receiving basic income with those not receiving it.  Early project cancellation  10 months after the Liberal administration started distributing payments, the early cancellation of the project was announced (in August 2018) by the Progressive Conservative government. Minister of Children and Youth Services Lisa MacLeod said the decision was taken due to high costs, and because ministry staff indicated that \\"the program didn't help people become 'independent contributors' to the economy.\\" McLeod added that the project did not align with the government of Doug Ford desire to move people from welfare to jobs. The Progressive Conservatives had earlier promised to maintain the project. Anti-poverty groups were \\"stunned\\" by the decision to discontinue the project. The Ontario Coalition Against Poverty declared that the decision \\"demonstrates a reckless disregard for the lives of nearly 4,000 people.\\" Local politicians in Hamilton passed a resolution \\"denouncing\\" discontinuation of the program. One writer went as far to say that the study was being ended early due to fears that the results would show that the program worked. Researchers were also dismayed by the decision. According to those studying the effect of the pilot project, effective interventions for individuals suffering poverty and insecurity as a result of low-paid or precarious employment can be challenging; researcher Kwame McKenzie noted that it is not easy to get 6,000 people to participate in a study. Ending the study early will make it difficult to gather conclusive data regarding the research goal of determining \\"what happens when low-wage, precarious workers receive a financial top-up.\\" = Project Findings = Although the project finished early, there was still much discussion and analysis of the benefits and challenges of the pilot. Anecdotal reports in the press indicated that entrepreneurship was not a goal for participants, although one report described a couple who kept their existing business afloat with the program's payments. Other journalistic reports tended to focus on non-entrepreneurial participant outcomes contributing to personal stability, such as augmenting disability payments, paying for education and student loans, purchasing new eyeglasses while remaining in a low-paid museum job, paying for transportation costs (such as bus fare to work rather than walking for an hour and a half), and purchasing necessary items like fresh produce, hospital parking passes, \\"winter clothes they couldn't [previously] afford and staying warm\\", etc. More formal research was undertaken by two sociologists. They undertook qualitative interviews with a small sample of project members who specifically wished to articulate their reflections on receiving basic income. The researchers identified four themes from these interviews: \\"1) a desire among participants to work and be financially independent, 2) traditional welfare payments are extremely low and do not cover basic necessities, while basic income is higher and does cover these necessities, 3) beyond the basic differences in benefit amount, the conditional nature of traditional welfare programs has significant repercussions for recipients, and 4) basic income has facilitated long-term financial planning.\\" The second and third themes were particularly pertinent. Participants reported that their nutrition improved, stress levels lowered, relationships improved and could escape from living in sub-standard housing. The unconditional nature of the scheme also had significant advantages, especially when compared with the Ontario Works welfare program or the Ontario Disability Support Program. With the basic income, bureaucratic confusion was removed, the intrusive nature of means testing was no longer present, the ability to keep earned income helped maintain the incentive to work and financial planning became possible.

The striped pyjama squid lives on the seafloor and is both venomous and poisonous. When fully mature, a striped pyjama squid will only be about 7 to 8 centimeters in length. Anatomy Because the striped pyjama squid is a type of cuttlefish, it is able to disguise itself by changing its appearance. The squid will change to a dark brown or purple color when it is being attacked or to camouflage itself with the surrounding environment. Sepioloidea lineolata has two tentacles for feeding and eight arms. It also has a rounded shell and is small. The squid's two feeding tentacles have suckers on them with toothed rims. Sepioloidea lineolata also have glands underneath their body that can secrete a toxic slime whenever the squid is being attacked by a predator. The slime that is produced by the squid contains many different proteins and toxins. The slime scares off the predators or allows the striped pyjama squid enough time to escape. Another defense mechanism that S. lineolata uses is its inking behavior. The ink that cephalopods produce is made of secretions from two different glands that is colored by melanin. The ink that expelled can mimic the shape of the squid and therefore distract the predator long enough for the squid to get away, or it can interfere with the vision of the predator. The striped pyjama squid has white and brown stripes all across its body. The white stripes on the squid are reflective of white light. The dark stripes are actually chromatophores, tiny sacs of pigment that the squid can flash. S. lineolata and other similar cephalopods are poisonous with the venom of their saliva containing tetrodotoxin, a type of neurotoxin. Feeding The striped pyjama squid is a predatory animal that feeds on fish, shrimp and crustaceans. During the day, Sepioloidea lineolata will bury itself in the sand to where only the top of its head and its yellow eye are visible. Throughout the day, the squid continues to flick sand particles over its body in order to remain hidden. Because the striped pyjama squid is almost always buried, its pupil is placed dorsally on its body. This also means that Sepioloidea lineolata have high density photoreceptors due to the increased eye movements. Parasites The striped pyjama squid has been found to be parasitized by dicyemids. Dicyemids are mesozoans, worm-like parasites that affect the renal appendages on cephalopods that live near the seafloor, like S. lineolata. These dicyemids are also usually host specific. Dicyemids are able to thrive inside the striped pyjama squid because the renal appendages are filled with fluid, which creates the perfect habitat for the parasite.Hidetaka Furuya and Kazuhiko Tsuneki \\"Biology of Dicyemid Mesozoans,\\" Zoological Science 20(5), (1 May 2003). https://doi.org/10.2108/zsj.20.519 Once inside S. lineolata, the dicyemid will receive its nutrition from the squid's urine. Mating and reproduction Sepioloidea lineolata reproduce sexually. In order to mate, a male striped pyjama squid will grasp a female striped pyjama squid and place her to where they are both head-to-head. The male squid then inserts a spermatophore, or a sperm packet, near where the female will store the sperm until she is ready to lay eggs. The male Sepioloidea lineolata can also remove sperm from another male if he detects it in the female. He removes the sperm using a specialized arm shaped like a spoon. Like many species in the order of Sepiida, the male usually dies after mating. The females lay their eggs soon after mating. They lay their eggs in batches or clumps under coral on the seafloor.

Originally discovered by quarrying, it used to be open to the public as a show cave, but is now closed. Description The cave is a fragment of a system associated with the River Yealm, which was exposed by quarrying. The main show cave has two entrances apart, both of which lead to the same extensive bedding plane chamber. Originally low, the passages were enlarged by archaeological excavation, and the two entrance passages were originally separated until connected by excavation between 1820 and 1835. The show cave is very short. The Lower Entrance to the north, which is only a little above river level, enters a short passage which after passes a flooded passage on the right the water level of which fluctuates with that of the River Yealm. This sumps after . The main route goes off to the left along a winding passage for some to where some steps on the left lead down into The Bedding Plane Chamber. Straight on the passage enlarges, with a large passage to the right leading to a boulder choke. This was passed to reach a chamber some high, but the route has since collapsed. To the left, the main path also enters The Bedding Plane Chamber, a low chamber with an area of over . At the far end some steps enter a passage leading to the Upper Entrance. The caves are bat roosts and the Greater Horseshoe, Lesser Horseshoe, and Natterer's bats have all been recorded. Geology Kitley Show Cave is a solutional formed in Devonian limestone, laid down some 350-400 Ma ago. The cave is phreatic, formed by a river below the water table, but was left dry when sea levels fell which allowed the deposition of speleothems. Animal remains found in the cave date to the last interglacial, about 120,000 years ago, and were found in fluvial deposits covered by speleothems, so the caves must have been active then. The path dug through in 1834 has since been covered by several centimetres of stalagmitic deposit. History The Kitley Cave Guide indicates that the main cave was entered about 1800 when quarry blasting exposed the entrance, although a more contemporaneous account claims that it was first entered in 1834 in similar circumstances. When it was opened it was reported as being \\"beautifully decorated with stalactites and stalagmites\\", and that the owner ordered a path be dug through the stalagmitic floor, which exposed the bones of a large animal. By 1905 it had been gated. In 1971 it was opened up as a self-guided show cave, with informational boards, within a nature reserve area. Over the next thirty years the show cave was closed and reopened twice, before being finally closed in 2000. During this time exploration work was undertaken by the Plymouth Caving Group and others, who extended Yealmpton Passage to the west to open up a high sloping chamber. Archaeology Much of the archaeology of Kitley Show Cave was destroyed when the path was dug in 1835, although remains of mammoth, rhino, horse, bison, hyena and bear bones have been identified. They were found in fluvial deposits and date from the last interglacial. Finds in neignbouring fragments of the same cave system include human remains and artefacts from the Late Magdalenian period of the Upper Paleolithic, as well as from the Bronze Age, but it is thought that at the time Kitley Show Cave was too wet to be used for habitation by animals or humans.

They had a maximum range of and could all be fired in 4-6 seconds. Accompanied by a reloading vehicle, the launcher took five men 6-10 minutes to reload manually, which usually happened at another location away from the firing position to avoid counter battery fire. Although powerful, the rockets were not accurate, dispersing 90-210 meters from each other, so multiple launchers were intended to be used at once to bombard a large area.

It was in use until the mid-1970s when it was replaced by the BM-27 Uragan. Unlike other Soviet artillery systems, it was not widely exported. It was exported to Ethiopia, who used them until the late 1980s, as well as Cuba. North Korea received 200 BMD-20s in the mid-1950s and still has the weapon in service.

Naram-Sin, who reigned between 2254 and 2218 BC, created the title of King of the Four Corners of the World. Relief today housed at the Istanbul Archaeological Museum. Seal of the Neo- Sumerian king Ibbi-Sin in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The inscription reads \\"Ibbi-Sin the strong king, king of Ur, King of the four corners of the world\\". King of the Four Corners of the World (Sumerian: lugal-an-ub-da-limmu- ba, Akkadian: ≈°arru kibrat 'arbaim, ≈°ar kibrƒÅti arba'i, or ≈°ar kibrƒÅt erbetti), alternatively translated as King of the Four Quarters of the World, King of the Heaven's Four Corners or King of the Four Corners of the Universe and often shortened to simply King of the Four Corners, was a title of great prestige claimed by powerful monarchs in ancient Mesopotamia. Though the term \\"four corners of the world\\" does refer to specific geographical places within and near Mesopotamia itself, these places were at the time the title was first used thought to represent locations near the actual edges of the world and as such, the title should be interpreted as something equivalent to \\"King of all the known world\\", a claim to universal rule over the entire world and everything within it. The title was first used by Naram-Sin of the Akkadian Empire in the 23rd century BC and was later used by the rulers of the Neo- Sumerian Empire, after which it fell into disuse. It was revived as a title by a number of Assyrian rulers, becoming especially prominent during the Neo- Assyrian Empire. The final ruler to claim the title was the first Persian Achaemenid king, Cyrus the Great, after his conquest of Babylon in 539 BC. It is possible, at least among Assyrian rulers, that the title of King of the Four Corners was not inherited through normal means. As the title is not attested for all Neo-Assyrian kings and for some only attested several years into their reign it is possible that it might have had to be earned by each king individually, possibly through completing successful military campaigns in all four points of the compass. The similar title of ≈°ar ki≈°≈°atim (\\"King of Everything\\" or \\"King of the Universe\\"), also with Akkadian origins and attested for some of the Neo-Assyrian kings, may have required seven successful military campaigns. The difference between the exact meaning of the two titles may have been that \\"King of the Universe\\" laid claim to the cosmological realm whereas \\"King of the Four Corners of the World\\" laid claim to the terrestrial.  Meaning of \\"Four Corners of the World\\"  The term \\"four corners of the world\\" appears in several ancient mythologies and cosmologies, wherein it roughly corresponds the four points of the compass. In most of these representations, four principal rivers run to these four corners, their water irrigating the four quadrants (or quarters) of the world. In the view of the Mesopotamian Akkadians, the term referred to four regions on the edge of the then known world; Subartu (probably corresponding to the region of Assyria) in the north, Martu (roughly corresponding to modern Syria) in the west, Elam in the east and Sumer in the south. To Naram-Sin of Akkad (r. 2254‚Äì2218 BC), the creator of the title, it probably, in geographical terms, expressed his dominion over the regions Elam, Subartu, Amurru and Akkad (representing east, north, west and south respectively). The term thus covers a somewhat clear geographical region, corresponding to Mesopotamia and its surroundings, but should be understood as referring to the entire known world. At the point in time when the title was first used, the 2200s BC, the Mesopotamians would have equated all of Mesopotamia to the entire world; the region was highly productive, densely populated and was bordered on all sides by seemingly empty and uninhabited lands. A title the like of King of the Four Corners of the World should be taken as meaning that its holder was the ruler of the entire Earth and everything within it. The title can be interpreted as being equivalent to calling oneself \\"King of all the known world\\". Thus, the title is an example of merism, combining contrasting concepts to refer to an entirety (the four corners being on the edges of the world and the title referring to them and everything in between).  History  = Background (2900‚Äì2334 BC) = Lugalzaggesi of Uruk (in orange) c. 2350 BC, one of the first kings to claim universal rule. During the Early Dynastic Period in Mesopotamia (c. 2900‚Äì2350 BC), the rulers of the various city-states in the region would often launch invasions into regions and cities far from their own, at most times with negligible consequences for themselves, in order to establish temporary and small empires to either gain of keep a superior position relative to the other city-states. This early empire-building was encouraged as the most powerful monarchs were often rewarded with the most prestigious titles, such as the title of lugal (literally \\"big man\\" but often interpreted as \\"king\\", probably with military connotations). Most of these early rulers had probably acquired these titles rather than inherited them. Eventually this quest to be more prestigious and powerful than the other city- states resulted in a general ambition for universal rule. Since Mesopotamia was equated to correspond to the entire world and Sumerian cities had been built far and wide (cities the like of Susa, Mari and Assur were located near the perceived corners of the world) it seemed possible to reach the edges of the world (at this time thought to be the lower sea, the Persian gulf, and the upper sea, the Mediterranean). Rulers attempting to reach a position of universal rule became more common during the Early Dynastic IIIb period (c. 2450‚Äì2350 BC) during which two prominent examples are attested. The first, Lugalannemundu, king of Adab, is claimed by the Sumerian King List (though this is a much later inscription, making the extensive rule of Lugalennemundu somewhat doubtful) to have created a great empire covering the entirety of Mesopotamia, reaching from modern Syria to Iran, saying that he \\"subjugated the Four Corners\\". The second, Lugalzaggesi, king of Uruk, conquered the entirety of Lower Mesopotamia and claimed (despite this not being the case) that his domain extended from the upper to the lower sea. Lugalzaggesi was originally titled as simply \\"King of Uruk\\" and adopted the title \\"King of the Land\\" (Sumerian: lugal-kalam-ma) to lay claim to universal rule. This title had also been employed by some earlier Sumerian kings claiming control over all of Sumer, such as Enshakushanna of Uruk. = Sumerian Kings of the Four Corners (2334‚Äì2004 BC) = The victory stele of Naram-Sin of Akkad, the first king to claim the title of King of the Four Corners, depicts the king with a horned helmet (symbolizing divinity) and twice as large as his soldiers, standing on a mountain that reaches the heavens. The stele is today housed in the Louvre, Paris. Sargon, king of Akkad, unified Lower and Upper Mesopotamia, creating the first true Mesopotamian empire. Though Sargon most commonly used the title \\"King of Akkad\\" (≈°ar mƒÅt Akkadi), he also introduced the more boastful title of ≈°ar ki≈°≈°atim (\\"King of Everything\\" or \\"King of the Universe\\"), used prominently by his successors. The title of \\"King of the Four Corners of the World\\" is first attested to have been used by the Akkadian king Naram-Sin, the grandson of Sargon of Akkad and the fourth ruler of the Akkadian Empire. Naram-Sin also proclaimed himself to be a living god (the first Mesopotamian king to do so), making his capital of Akkad not only the political but also the religious center of the empire. It is possible that Naram-Sin might have been inspired to claim the title following his conquest of the city Ebla, in which quadripartite divisions of the world and the universe were prominent parts of the city's ideology and beliefs. The title of King of the Four Corners suggests that Naram-Sin viewed himself not merely as a Mesopotamian ruler but as a universal ruler who happened to conform to the usual Mesopotamian royal traditions, the monarch of a new empire that not only incorporated the city-states of Mesopotamia but the lands beyond as well. In particular, art made during the period starts to incorporate previously unseen objects such as highland plants and animals and mountains, previously seen as highly foreign objects. Their increasing appearance in art suggests that they were seen as belonging to the empire of Akkad as much as everything else did. It is possible that ≈°ar ki≈°≈°atim referred to the authority to govern the cosmological realm whilst \\"King of the Four Corners\\" referred to the authority to govern the terrestrial. Eitherway, the implication of these titles was that the Mesopotamian king was the king of the entire world. The title doesn't appear to have been used by any of Naram-Sin's direct successors of the Akkadian Empire, which began to collapse during the reign of Naram-Sin's son Shar-Kali-Sharri. In the 2100s BC, the Gutians attacked the Akkadian Empire and supplanted the ruling \\"Sargonic\\" dynasty, destroying the city of Akkad and establishing an empire of their own. By 2112 BC, the Gutians had been driven out and the city of Ur had become the center of a new Sumerian civilization, referred to as the Third Dynasty of Ur or the Neo-Sumerian Empire. The rulers of this empire emulated the previous monarchs from Akkad, referring to themselves as \\"Kings of Sumer and Akkad\\" and all of them‚Äîwith the exception of the founder of the dynasty, Ur-Nammu‚Äîused the title of \\"King of the Four Corners of the World\\". Some ancient sources confer the title onto Ur-Nammu as well, referring to him as \\"King in Heaven and the Four Corners of the World\\", but these inscriptions date to centuries after his reign. = Assyrian Kings of the Four Corners (1366‚Äì627 BC) = Ashurnasirpal II of the Neo-Assyrian Empire was referred to as King of the Totality of the Four Corners including all their rulers. Relief today housed at the British Museum, London. With the collapse of the Neo-Sumerian Empire in c. 2004 BC, the title fell into disuse once more. Except for the Babylonian king Hammurabi who claimed to be \\"the king who made the four corners of the Earth obedient\\" in 1776 BC, the title was not used until occasionally by Assyrian kings of the Middle-Assyrian Empire, often as \\"King of All the Four Corners of the World\\" (≈°ar kullat kibrƒÅt erbetti). The first king of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, Adad-nirari II (r. 911‚Äì891 BC), used the title of \\"King of the Four Corners\\". The concept of a king governing the four corners of the world was well-established by the reign of the second king of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, Tukulti-Ninurta II (r. 891‚Äì884 BC), who claimed to have been \\"he whose honoured name he has pronounced forever for the four corners\\" (ana mu urut kibrƒÅt erbetti ana dƒÅri≈° i≈°quru) and \\"governor of the four corners\\" (muma'er kibrƒÅt erbetti). In Assyria, the deity Ashur was referred to as \\"[the one] who makes the king‚Äôs kingship surpass the kings of the four quarters\\" (mu≈°arb√ª ≈°arr≈´tija eli ≈°arrƒÅni ≈°a kibrƒÅt erbetti). Tukulti-Ninurta II's son and successor, Ashurnasirpal II (r. 883‚Äì859 BC) is in different inscriptions twice referred to as ‚ÄúKing of the Totality of the Four Corners including all their rulers‚Äù (≈°ar ki≈°≈°at kibrƒÅte ≈°a nap·∏´ar malkƒ´ kal√Æ≈°unu). The title is also attested for his son and successor, Shalmaneser III (r. 859‚Äì824 BC) and is the only title applied to this king by his successors. Sennacherib of the Neo-Assyrian Empire could only claim the title five years into his reign after having completed military campaigns in all four directions of the compass. Relief originally discovered near Mount Judi. The Kition stele, a large basalt stele discovered on Cyprus and the westernmost ancient Assyrian artifact known, identifies the king Sargon II, (r. 722‚Äì705 BC) with many titles, including \\"King of the Universe\\", \\"King of Assyria\\", \\"King of Sumer and Akkad\\", \\"Governor of Babylon\\" and \\"King of the Four Corners of the World\\". Sargon II's son and heir Sennacherib (r. 705‚Äì681 BC) did not immediately inherit the title, referring to himself simply as the \\"unrivaled king\\" at the beginning of his reign. Sennacherib conducted several military campaigns during his reign, after which he routinely added titles to his titulary. After his third campaign he added \\"king of the world\\" and after conquests in the Mediterranean Sea and Persian Gulf in 694 BC he added the title \\"King from the Upper Sea of the Setting Sun to the Lower Sea of the Rising Sun\\". It was only after Sennacherib had conducted campaigns to the south, east, west and north during his fifth campaign that he replaced the title of \\"unrivaled king\\" with \\"King of the Four Corners of the World\\". Sennacherib's son and heir, Esarhaddon (r. 681‚Äì669 BC) also used the title of \\"King of the Four Corners of the World\\" alongside that of \\"King of the Universe\\". Unlike the apparent dynastic inheritance of the title during the Neo-Sumerian Empire, it is possible that the title of King of the Four Corners had to be earned by each Assyrian king individually, thus explaining why the title is not attested for every Neo-Assyrian king and why Sennacherib first used it several years into his reign. British historian Stephanie Dalley, specializing in the Ancient Near East proposed in 1998 that the title may have had to be earned through the king successfully campaigning in all four points of the compass. Dalley also proposed that the similar title of \\"King of the Universe\\", with a virtually identical meaning, would have been earned through seven (which would have been connected to totality in the eyes of the Assyrians) successful campaigns. It would thus not have been possible for the king to claim either title before the required military campaigns. Periods during which the title was not used, such as the ~80-year gap between Shalmaneser III and Tiglath-Pileser III, probably reflect periods during which the military activity of the country and its kings declined. = Cyrus the Great (539 BC) = After the fall of the Neo-Assyrian Empire in 609 BC, the principal power in Mesopotamia was the Neo-Babylonian Empire. The founder of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, Nabopolassar, wished to associate himself with the previous Assyrian rulers to establish continuity and assumed many of the same titles such as ≈°arru dannu (\\"mighty king\\") and the much older Sumerian \\"King of Sumer and Akkad\\" (which had been used by the Neo-Assyrian rulers as well) but do not appear to have assumed the title of King of the Four Corners. Unlike previous ruling dynasties in Mesopotamia, the Neo-Babylonians usually only employed one royal title on any one occasion. Only rarely are examples with more than one royal title in use found from the Neo-Babylonian period, which might explain the absence of \\"King of the Four Corners...\\" since this was an additional prestigious title rather than a primary royal title. Nabopolassar's successors abandoned most of the old Assyrian titles, even abandoning the \\"mighty king\\" used by Nabopolassar. The Neo-Babylonian Empire ended with the conquest of Babylon by the Persian king Cyrus the Great, founder of the Achaemenid Persian Empire, in 539 BC. The Cyrus Cylinder is an ancient clay cylinder written in Akkadian cuneiform script in the name of Cyrus, made to be used as a foundation deposit and buried in the walls of Babylon. In the text of the cylinder, Cyrus assumes several traditional Mesopotamian titles including those of \\"King of Babylon\\", \\"King of Sumer and Akkad\\" and \\"King of the Four Corners of the World\\". The title was not used after the reign of Cyrus but his successors did adopt similar titles. The popular regnal title \\"King of Kings\\", used by monarchs of Iran until the modern age, was originally a title introduced by the Assyrian Tukulti-Ninurta I in the 13th century BC (rendered ≈°ar ≈°arrƒÅni in Akkadian). The title of \\"King of Lands\\", also used by Assyrian monarchs since at least Shalmaneser III, was also adopted by Cyrus the Great and his successors. Titles such as \\"King of Kings\\" and \\"Great-King\\" (≈°arru rabu), ancient titles with the connotation of holding supreme power in the lands surrounding Babylon, would remain in use up until the Sassanid dynasty in Persia of the 3rd to 7th centuries.

Pugh was the eldest son of William Pugh of Mathafarn and his wife Margaret Lloyd, daughter of John Lloyd of Ceiswyn and Aberllefenni, Merionethshire. He was admitted at Inner Temple in 1690 and matriculated at Jesus College, Oxford on 13 June 1691, aged 15.In 1700 he was called to the bar. Having been appointed to the commission of the peace, he was removed in about 1702, but was then named as a Deputy Lieutenant for the county in 1703. He married Elizabeth Scudamore, daughter of John Scudamore, 2nd Viscount Scudamore in about.1708. Pugh was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament for Cardiganshire at the 1705 general election, probably by the influence of Lewis Pryse and was restored to the commission of the peace. In Parliament he voted against the Court candidate in the division on the Speaker on 25 October 1705, and told on the Tory side on 22 January 1706. At the 1708 general election, he changed seats to Montgomery Boroughs, where his family had an interest and was returned unopposed. He was present at a meeting of Tory gentlemen in Aberystwyth in 1710 when Lewis Pryse and the assembled company drank the Pretender's health on their knees. He was a Tory on his unopposed return to Parliament in 1710 although frequently absent. At the 1713 general election, he was returned unopposed again. He was a teller on 29 June 1714 in a division on the Southwark election and on 12 August 1714 presented a bill to correct mistakes in the 1714 Land Tax Act. Pugh was returned for Montgomery Boroughs at the 1715 general election but was inactive in Parliament. In 1719, he was taken into custody for defaulting on a call of the House. He succeeded his father in 1719 and became a dominant figure in Montgomeryshire politics. At the 1722 general election, he was returned again, with the help of Sir Watkin Williams Wynn, 3rd Baronet. He did not stand at the 1727 general election, but there was a double return at Montgomery and he was called to testify as a witness for the Tory candidate on the election petition. Pugh died on 30 November 1737, and was buried at Llanwrin. He had one son who predeceased him. His heiress was a niece, the wife of Thomas Pryse of Gogerddan. The Mathafarn estate was subsequently sold to the trustees of Sir Watkin Williams Wynn for ¬£33,400, and merged into the Wynnstay estate.

He spent most of his career in Mexico, where he arrived in 1975 to play with Le√≥n. As a manager, he won a Primera Divisi√≥n title with Toluca as caretaker, coaching the team in the last four games of the tournament (the two legs of the playoffs semi-finals and the two legs of the final). Jorge is the only caretaker manager to have won a league title in the Liga MX so far. Club career Jorge started his professional football career with Racing Club de Avellaneda in 1970 as a midfielder. During his spell with Racing, Jorge played 167 matches and scored 39 goals. At some point, Jorge was considered by C√©sar Luis Menotti in his preliminar lists for the 1978 FIFA World Cup Argentine squad, despite this, knowing that his chances to make it to the World Cup were remote, he decided to continue his career in Mexico. Alberto Jorge arrived to Mexico in 1975, where he would spend most of his career as footballer. He first played for Le√≥n from 1975 to 1980, a club that paid US$12,000 for his transfer. In five seasons with the club, he played in 168 matches and scored 52 goals.Sources for his five seasons in Le√≥n:  Jorge then moved to Atlante, where he played from 1980 to 1982, having 44 appearances and scoring three goals. He was part of the squad that were runners-up to UANL in the 1981‚Äì82 season. In the last stage of his career, Jorge played for Oaxtepec from 1982, the team's first season in the Mexican Primera Divisi√≥n, till 1984. As a player for Oaxtepec, Jorge made 52 appearances and scored 23 goals, 21 in the 1982‚Äì83 season, including a hat-trick against Atlas. Also, he was the runner-up top scorer for the Mexican Primera Divisi√≥n that season, second to Am√©rica's Norberto Outes, who scored 22 goals, only one more than Jorge. Managerial career =Toluca= Jorge was appointed as interim head coach of Toluca in the playoffs of the Apertura 2002, after Uruguayan Wilson Graniolatti resigned as manager of the team. For the Apertura 2002 tournament, Ricardo La Volpe was the manager of the club for the regular part of the tournament, but was called to manage Mexico national football team just before the beginning of the playoff round of the tournament.

January 11, 1967. was promulgated during the third stage of the Francoist regime in Spain, by a government in which most of the power was in the hands of technocrats. Together with the other seven Fundamental Laws of the Realm, the process of institutionalization of the Francoist regime was achieved. The law was approved by a referendum on 14 December 1966, with the favorable vote of 98.1% of the voters.Nohlen, D & St√∂ver, P (2010) Elections in Europe: A data handbook, p1823  Content  The law was structured in sixty-six articles distributed in ten titles: * Title I. The National State. It includes national sovereignty and the fundamental aims of the State: the defense of the unity of men; the integrity, independence and security of the Nation; the safeguarding of the spiritual and material heritage of the Spaniards; the protection of the rights of the person, of the family and of society; and the promotion of a just social order. It also regulates the national flag. Among the rights stand out those of association, religious freedom and the possibility of creating political associations. * Title II. The Head of State. It makes the Head of State as the representative of the Nation. His status and inviolability are recognized. He will be assisted and be advised, by the Council of the Kingdom and will be empowered to call for a referendum, and concentrates in making major policy decisions and in ensuring the overall integrity of the state and serves as the commander-in-chief of the armed forces and the chief representative of Spain in diplomatic relations and is the leader of the Movimiento Nacional, the ruling coalition suppporting the fascist dictatorship.

The latter will be appointed for a term of five years by the Head of State from a list of three candidates proposed by the Council of the Kingdom.

The President of the Government facilitates the carrying out of major policy decisions and runs the day-to-day government. The Council of Ministers, or the Cabinet helps him or her in implementing the major policy decisions. This system was fully implemented in 1973, when Franco appointed as President of the Government Luis Carrero Blanco (who was assassinated by ETA after several months in office, and was replaced by Carlos Arias Navarro). * Title IV. The National Council. Called Cortes Espa√±olas, it exercises legislative power. It has a complex election system, with ex officio members (among them university rectors), members appointed by the Head of State and members elected by the community, representing the Family, Local Corporations and the Trade Union Organization. In particular, there were 102 procurators elected by the third of the family, something that was already foreseen in the of 1942, but those until that moment had not been elected. * Title V. The Justice. It includes the independence of Justice and the gratuity for those who lack resources. The jurisdictional orders are ordinary (Civil, Criminal, Contentious- Administrative and Labor) and special (Military and Ecclesiastical). * Title VI. The Armed Forces. It integrates the three branches of the Spanish Armed Forces (Army, Navy and Air Force) and law enforcement agencies (namely, General Police Corps and Armed Police Corps; see :es:Polic√≠a franquista). The three branches of the Armed Forces have a General Staff, coordinated through the Defence High Command. The National Defense Board proposes to the Government the policies concerning national security and defense. * Title VII. The Administration of the State. It includes the principle of legality, provides for an administrative procedure with recourse and the submission to judicial control of the contentious-administrative jurisdiction. It includes the National Economy Council and the Court of Accounts. * Title VIII. The Local Administration.

Activism  Phillips at the 2017 Native Nations Rise March At the end of the 20th century, Phillips was working to create a foster care system run by American Indians for American Indian children to help them gain an appreciation for their heritage: \\"I don't want our children to think that prison is the only place for them to go.\\" The New York Times identified Phillips as a former director of the Native Youth Alliance, a group aiming to uphold traditional culture and spiritual ways for future Native Americans, and reported that he leads an annual ceremony honoring Native American war veterans in Arlington National Cemetery. The Guardian called him \\"a well-known Native American activist who was among those leading the Standing Rock protests in 2016 and 2017 against the construction of an oil pipeline in North Dakota\\".'The Latest: Police: About 20 fires set at Dakota Access camp', Associated Press February 23, 2017. Phillips was among the last of the protesters when law enforcement evicted the camps and effectively ended the protests, which for his part were \\"a prayer (...) a commitment to stand for our youth, for our children, for nature and for myself, standing for my nation.\\"Jack Dura, 'Hundreds of Dakota Access protest cases remain open', Associated Press March 3, 2018. In 2015 Phillips alleged a group of students from Eastern Michigan University harassed him.According to a April 22, 2015, Fox local news report by Dave Spencer, in 2015, Phillips filed a report of racial harassment with Eastern Michigan University campus police against 30 to 40 students who \\"referred to themselves as the Hurons, the former mascot at EMU\\", dressed as Native Americans for an American Indian theme party. He was \\"bombarded with racial slurs\\", and one of the students threw a beer can at him. A January 2019 article in The Washington Post described Phillips as a \\"a veteran in the indigenous rights movement\\". A January 2019 article in Indian Country Today described Phillips as a \\"keeper of a sacred pipe\\". =Between Earth and Sky= Phillips is the subject of the award-winning 2013 documentary film Between Earth and Sky in which he and his wife, Shoshana, travel back to his Omaha reservation after his wife was diagnosed with bone-marrow cancer.

In a February 20, 2017, interview that took place during the Dakota Access Pipeline protests (DAPL), Phillips explained he had answered the casting call because he wanted to help his children cope with his wife's cancer. Lincoln Memorial confrontation On January 18, 2019, snippets of videos recorded at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., appeared to show Phillips being harassed by a group of 50 to 60 high school boys who had attended the coinciding annual March for Life; they were widely shared through social media. Print media described Philips as surrounded by the students, one of whom, Nicholas Sandmann, exhibited a \\"relentless smirk\\".Print media weeks later walked back much of its reporting; see for example this Editor's Note. Philips had walked towards and into a group of adolescent boys from Covington Catholic High School (CovCath), who had traveled from Kentucky on a school trip to attend the anti-abortion March for Life.The March For Life had a permit for a First Amendment demonstrations on the National Mall on that day. According to The Cut, CovCath sends an annual delegation of its students to attend the anti-abortion March For Life in Washington. He began to chant the AIM Song, a traditional Native American inter-tribal powwow song. Videos showed Sandmann, later identified as a junior at CovCath, and Phillips facing each other inches apart while Phillips chanted and beat his drum and some of the students in the background allegedly did \\"Tomahawk chops\\" and danced. Several students wore red \\"Make America Great Again\\" caps. Shortly after the video went viral, CovCath's communications director released a statement regretting that the incident took place. On January 19, 2019, multiple students who were present at the incident stated that coverage of the incident had been skewed. Sandmann released a statement saying that the students were confronted by four members of the Black Hebrew Israelites, that Philips tried to provoke the students, and denying that they had chanted \\"build the wall\\" or used any racist language or gestures. Interviewed after the event, Phillips said, \\"While I was there singing, I heard them saying 'Build that wall! Build that wall!', you know... this is indigenous land! ...We're not supposed to have walls here, we never did‚Äîfor millennium. Before anybody else came here we never had walls. We never had a prison. We always took care of our elders, we took care of our children,\\" and \\"There was that moment when I realized I've put myself between beast and prey, [t]hese young men were beastly and these old black individuals was their prey.\\" In the days after the confrontation, Journalists reviewed hours of tapes from multiple points of view and, in their opinion, showed that videos of the event either \\"[contradicted] or [failed] to confirm accounts provided in that story‚Äîincluding that Phillips was prevented by Sandmann from moving on, that his group had been taunted by the students in the lead-up to the encounter, [that] the students were trying to instigate a conflict,\\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/03/01/editors-note- related-lincoln-memorial-incident and the video evidence was consistent with the students' version of events. Video footage also showed members of the Black Hebrew Israelites shouting targeted racial insults and slurs at a group of Native Americans and later at the students. Asked why he had approached the group of students, Phillips said that he was trying to defuse a confrontation between the group of students and a small group of Black Hebrew Israelites who were shouting insults and profanities at the students. In subsequent interviews Phillips and his associates stated they interpreted the cheers that the students' directed toward their nearby Indigenous Peoples March as racist.

The Participating units of the partnership are traded on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, and it is considered one of the ten largest bodies of trade in the Tel Aviv Stock exchange market. In October 2017, Delek Drilling and the Russian Gazprom signed a Memorandum of Understanding on to jointly examine the possibilities of using natural gas as a fuel for vehicles and special equipment in Israel. = The Gas Framework = In December 2015, the Israeli Government approved the Natural Gas Framework, which constitutes a comprehensive regulation. Main principles of the Framework was that Delek must sell all their rights in the small fields Tanin and Karish within a specified 14 month timeframe. Delek Group must sell all of its rights in the Tamar field and Noble Energy must sell at least 11% of its rights by December 2021. In 2016, Karish and Tanin Gas reserves were sold to Energean Energean Oil & Gas. The deal followed the natural gas framework requiring Delek Drilling and Noble Energy to sell these two reservoirs, which contain 60 BCM of gas for $148 million. In 2017, sale of 9.25% of the holdings of Delek Drilling in the Tamar reservoir to the Tamar Petroleum partnership was completed for $980 million.  Discoveries  Delek Drilling, alongside its partners Avner and Noble Energy were the first to provide commercial quantities of natural gas to the Israeli market as it started flowing gas from the Mary-b field by the coast of Ashkelon in 2004. The field which was discovered in the year 2000 allowed setting up primary infrastructure for producing electricity using natural gas in Israel. In 2009, Delek Drilling and Avner, played a leading role in discovering the Tamar gas reservoir alongside its partners Noble Energy, Isramco and Dor. The discovered reservoir, 4.5 kilometers deep in a 1,700 meters deep waters, was the biggest deep waters discovery in 2009 worldwide. In 2010 the Leviathan gas field, twice the size of the Tamar gas field, was discovered by a partnership which included Delek Drilling, Avner, Ratio and Noble Energy. In 2011 Delek Drilling, Avner and Noble Energy discovered the Afrodita gas field, deep inside the territorial waters of Cyprus. Delek Drilling took part in a few other significant revelations in the waters of Israel (reservoirs Tanin, Dolphin, Karish and Tamar). = Discoveries by chronological order = * 1999 ‚Äì Noa reservoir, discovered in cooperation with the American drilling company Noble Energy. * 2000 ‚Äì Mary-B reservoir which together with the Noa reservoir combines the Yam Tethys project. * 2009 ‚Äì Dalit and Tamar reservoirs, discovered by Delek Drilling in cooperation with Avner, Noble Energy, Isramco and Dor, containing 306 BCM. * 2010 ‚Äì Leviathan reservoir, discovered by Delek Drilling in cooperation with Noble Energy, Avner, Ratio, containing 608 BCM. * 2011 ‚Äì Afrodita reservoir, discovered by Delek Drilling in cooperation with Avner and Noble Energy, on the coast of Cyprus. * 2012 ‚Äì Tanin reservoir, discovered by Delek Drilling in cooperation with Avner and Noble Energy containing 35 BCM. * 2013 ‚Äì Karish reservoir, discovered by Delek Drilling in cooperation with Avner and Noble Energy on the coast of Haifa, containing 70 BCM Energean bought Karish and Tanin reservoirs from Delek Drilling and plans to invest about $1.8 billion in developing them.  Exporting Gas  Jordanian firms Arab Potash and Jordan Bromine signed a deal in 2014 to import 2 billion cubic metres of gas from Israel's Tamar field over 15 years. the gas is technically being sold to the Jordanians by the American company, Noble Energy (on behalf of the Israeli partners), and not directly by the Tamar partners which include Delek Drilling, Noble energy and Isramco. The flow of natural gas began in January 2017, marking the country's first ever exports of natural gas. After developing the different reservoirs, an agreement signed in September 2016 finalized the export of natural gas to the Jordanian electricity company NEPCO from the Leviathan gas field for a time period of 15 years and at a total amount of approximately 45 BCM. A large scale agreement worth over $15 billion was signed in February 2018 and included gas transactions for 10 years for the amount of 64 BCM with the Egyptian company Dolphinos. The Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sissi, addressed the deal: \\"It Has a lot of advantages for us (Egyptians), and I want people to be reassured.\\" In September 2018, Delek Drilling and Noble Energy have announced that together with Egyptian company EastMed, they are acquiring a 39% stake in the EMG Egypt-Israel gas pipeline in order to fulfil their deal with Egypt's Dolphinus.

It is a fusion of numerous popular and folk styles derived from Africa, Europe and the Americas. It is rhythmically complex, with percussion instruments including skratji (a very large bass drum) and snare drums, as well as saxophone, trumpet and occasionally trombone. Singing can be both solo and choir. Songs are typically call-and-response, as are Creole folk styles from the area, such as kawina.  Etymology  The term Kaseko may be derived from Kas√©k√≤, a Guianan creole dance.  History  Kaseko emerged from the traditional Afro-Surinamese kawina music, which was played since the beginning of 1900 by Creole street musicians in Paramaribo. It evolved in the 1930s during festivities that used large bands, especially brass bands, and was called Bigi Pokoe (\\"big drum music\\"). Following World War II, jazz, calypso and other importations became popular, while rock and roll soon left its own influence in the form of electrified instruments. In the 1970s, Surinamese expatriates living in the Netherlands, such as Lieve Hugo and Ewald Krolis, popularized kaseko.

He followed and later replaced Punicus as their major military leader during the Lusitanian War.  Biography  He is described in sources as Punicus's lieutenant, which would explain the quick way he was promoted to leader after the latter's death. Caesarus might have previously accompanied him during his service as a mercenary for Phoenician or Carthaginian territories in the south of the Iberian Peninsula. In 155 BC, Punicus provoked the Lusitanians and Vettones into revolting and pillaging the Roman colonies, but after being killed in 153 BC, he was relieved by Caesarus. The new chieftain had his first major battle in Hispania Baetica against the forces of Roman Praetor Lucius Mummius. Although the Roman forces were initially successful, obliging the Lusitanians to fall back and abandon their plunder, the Roman forces became disorganised in the chase, which Caesarus capitalised on to counter-attack. Mummius was defeated in the ensuing battle with 9,000 of his men dying, allowing the Lusitanians to regain their spoils and also capture many of the Romans' weapons and standards. It has been speculated the whole sequence might have been a deliberate ruse by the Lusitanians. In any case, Caesarus then paraded mockingly with the Roman standards through the Iberian peninsula. Caesarus's forces faced Mummius again later, after the latter had remained in fortified positions training his army. This time Mummius won, recovering part of the lost plunder. Caesarus is not mentioned as being among the Lusitanians, making his ultimate fate unknown. Shortly after, another Lusitanian contingent from adjacent lands would join the war, led by the warlord Caucenus.  Etymology  The meaning of the name Kaisaro is disputed, though it is believed it has a Phoenician root, bringing the possibility it was a title gained during his military experience in Phoenician territories. It might derive from the word ksr, related to the Carthaginian god Kusor, or alternatively from kysr, translating as \\"elephant\\" (the same origin as the Roman surname and title Caesar). Departing from the Phoenician thesis, it might come as well from the Celtic, most specifically the words gaesi (\\"valiant man\\") or gaesum (\\"iron dart\\"), similar to the Celtic-Germanic name Caesorix.  In film and television  The Spanish television series Hispania, La Leyenda (2010-2012) features Caesarus as the chief of Viriathus's home village. He is played by Llu√≠s Marco.

He was decorated by Yugoslav authorities for his bravery in this conflict and promoted to the rank of Captain.  Prelude to World War II  Vauhnik was probably the first in the world who presented information that the Nazi Germany would invade Poland and Yugoslavia and later Soviet Union, based on the covert and legal methods he used. Based on the orders of Milan Nediƒá, who was Minister of Defence of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, Vauhnik visited German supreme command twice, to secure Yugoslav interest in the port of Thessaloniki. His colleagues during military education in √âcole sp√©ciale militaire de Saint-Cyr in France included Dra≈æa Mihailoviƒá.

Vauhnik also emphasized that government of the United Kingdom was informed about those plans. After Axis invasion of Yugoslavia, Vauhnik was captured in Belgrade and transported to Berlin at the beginning of May 1941 where he was interrogated in Reich Main Security Office. He was released as German citizen because he was born in part of Yugoslavia which was annexed by Germany at that time. After his release Vauhnik went to Ljubljana. In 1942 Vauhnik forged a plan to transport King Peter II of Yugoslavia to Axis occupied Yugoslavia to mobilize Serbs and Croats under his command.: \\"Colonel Vladimir Vauhnik, the Yugoslav military attache\\" in Berlin, described to me how he worked out a plan in 1942 to send King Peter to Yugoslavia so that Serbs and Croats might rally under his leadership.\\" His plan was based on the fact that German forces were entingled on Eastern Front while Italians could be convinced not to interfere. Vauhnik was coworker of Ivan Prezelj, commander of Slovenian Chetniks (Blue Guard). Vauhnik was initiator for establishment of the Military Council of all Slovene liberal political movements (). Vauhnik was at that time on the position of acting commander of the Headquarter of the Chetniks in Slovenia. In 1944 Dra≈æa Mihailoviƒá promoted Vauhnik to rank of Brigadier General. According to Chetnik voivode ≈†u≈°teriƒç, Vauhnik and Mihailoviƒá were blood brothers. According to some sources, Vauhnik travelled to Switzerland in June 1944 to offer to put Slovenian domobranci, some soldiers of Independent State of Croatia and some Chetnik units under British command.: \\"It appears that in June 1944, Colonel Vauhnik had come to Switzerland to offer the services of the Slovene Domobranci, of some Croat soldiers and some Chetniks to the British. \\" His offer was rejected by the British representatives.: \\"And it also appears that he was unceremoniously turned down.\\"  After World War II  After World War II Vauhnik went to Buenos Aires in Argentina where he lived quiet life without joining any of numerous Yugoslav emigrant political groups.

The nearest higher peak is Mount Belanger, to the north, and Kleodora Peak lies to the immediate northwest. Karpathos Peak can be seen from the Icefields Parkway, weather permitting. History The mountain was named for the Greek island Karpathos, home to the town Olympos. The peak originally had the unofficial name Olympus, but was subsequently changed to avoid confusion with other Mount Olympus in the range. However, no name has been officially adopted yet for this peak. The first ascent of the mountain was made in 1926 by J.W.A. Hickson and Howard Palmer with guide Hans Fuhrer. Geology Karpathos Peak is composed of sedimentary rock laid down from the Precambrian to Jurassic periods, then pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Karpathos Peak is located in a subarctic climate with long, cold, snowy winters, and short mild summers.

She serves as co-director of the centre for environmental magnetism & palaeomagnetism and works on magnetic nanoparticles and pollution.  Education and early career  Maher earned her bachelor's degree in geography at the University of Liverpool. She remained there for her graduate studies, earning a PhD in environmental geophysics for research on the origins and transformations of magnetic minerals in soils. Career and research After completing her PhD, Maher was made a Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) Fellow at the University of Edinburgh. She joined the University of East Anglia as a lecturer in 1987 and was promoted to Reader in 1998. Here she investigated the magnetic properties of ultrafine sub-micron magnetites. Using her understanding of magnetic minerals, she evaluated the climate of the Loess Plateau. She developed spatial and temporal reconstructions of the Asian palaeomonsoon. She was the Royal Institution Scientists for the new century lecturer in 1999. She edited the book Quaternary Climates, Environments and Magnetism in 1999. Maher studies magnetic nanoparticles to track climate change and changes in human health. She was described by Richard Harrison as having \\"single-handedly developed the field of environmental magnetism\\". She demonstrated that soils that were exposed to higher rainfall make more magnetite. She has studied how windblown dusts impacted the levels of greenhouse gases. She is interested in magnetic records of Quaternary terrestrial sediments. She launched the Quantifying Uncertainty in the Earth System (QUEST) Working Group on Dust in 2008. Maher became interested in metal-rich particulate pollution. In 2013 Maher demonstrated that silver birch trees could be used as pollution filters. The result was part of an investigation into the impact of roadside trees on the concentration of particulate matter found in people's homes. Silver birch trees are covered in tiny hairs, which can trap the particulate matter whilst allowing clean air to circulate. The matter is washed off the leaves when it rains, allowing the birch trees to trap even more particulate matter. Her work was examined by Michael Mosley and Gabriel Weston on the BBC show Trust Me, I'm a Doctor. They found that the pollution collected in houses protected by silver birch trees was 50 - 60% lower than in houses without them. In 2016 Maher found toxic nanoparticles in human brain tissue. By studying the nanoparticles using an electron microscope, Maher found they were small and round, indicating that they had been formed at high temperatures. As the nanoparticles have diameters that are less than 200 nm, they can enter the brain through the olfactory nerve. Magnetite can produce reactive oxygen species in the brain. Maher became concerned that these magnetite particles could be linked to Alzheimer's disease, mental illness and reduced intelligence. She appeared on BBC Radio 4's Inside Science in 2018, discussing the Government of the United Kingdom Clean Air Strategy.

Etymology The word derives from huachicol ‚Äì originally, according to the Mexican Academy of the Language, an alcoholic beverage adulterated with low-grade alcohol made from sugarcane ‚Äì plus the suffix -ero, indicating a profession or occupation. El Colegio de M√©xico's ' offers two definitions for huachicol or guachicol: a tool comprising a pole with a basket on one end, used to pick fruit from trees, or the person who uses such a tool; and \\"a criminal who steals fuel by tapping the pipelines that carry it.\\" According to the Academy's Diccionario de Mexicanismos, the term also derives from the word guacho, from the Mayan word waach, which means \\"thief\\" in some parts of Mexico. Modern-day illegal activities Fuel theft from pipelines owned by Pemex, the state oil company, has been a long-term problem in Mexico. The problem worsened in the 2010s as organized crime groups in Mexico began including oil theft as part of their main streams of revenue. With the international soaring of fuel prices, this criminal activity became a lucrative business for thieves. Oil theft crime groups used bribery and violence to corrupt government officials. Investigators suspect that several officials within Pemex are involved in facilitating the operations of these criminal groups. Complicity includes activities such as employees sharing the exact time when the fuel will flow through the pipelines, the maps of the pipelines, and how to successfully perforate them. Illegally extracting or possessing oil from pipelines, vehicles, equipment, or installations is a federal crime in Mexico and is punishable with up to 20 years in prison. The fuel they steal is generally sold on the black market at a discounted price. These groups have gained support from impoverished communities because they provide low-cost fuel and give some locals a venue for employment as fuel carriers and lookouts. Their supply of illegal fuel is believed to sustain entire communities in some parts of the states of Veracruz, Puebla and Hidalgo. By mid-2018, the rate of pipeline perforations had risen considerably to slightly over 40 perforations per day, compared to 28 perforations per day in 2017. In the first 10 months of 2018, 12,581 illegal perforations were reported across pipelines in Mexico. As a result of the increase of fuel theft, the federal government has spent approximately US$3 billion per year on pipeline repairs and maintenance, as well as compensation to oil consumers for whom the oil was intended. Given the volatile nature of motor fuel, accidents are common: in December 2010, an explosion in San Mart√≠n Texmelucan de Labastida, Puebla, killed 29 people, and at least 137 were killed in the Tlahuelilpan pipeline explosion in Hidalgo on 18 January 2019. When President Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador took office in December 2018, he launched a campaign against oil theft gangs, and dispatched close to 5,000 troops from the Armed Forces and the Federal Police to guard pipelines across Mexico. Part of his strategy was to divert the flow of fuel from pipelines, detect leaks when they occurred, and transport the fuel by trucks. Most of the thieves operate in remote areas, and drill at the pipelines during the night to avoid detection. These measures were intended to stop the thieves from illegally tapping fuel pipes. When implemented, however, the measures led to logistical problems, resulting in fuel shortages and long lines at filling stations nationwide in January 2019. The Federal Police component would be later be replaced by the National Guard in the late spring when that service was officially created by an act of Congress.

The project consisted of the creation of the \\"Organization to solve the foreigner question\\" and series of actions and pranks performed by the fictitious representatives, Dr. Alois B. Stocher and his assistant George Klein. Dr. Alois Stocher, president of OLAF, and his assistant George Klein. Federal square in Bern, 2010  Art vs. Politics  As Heusser and N√ºssli explained in a TV interview, the goal was to use the means of art to create a \\"counterweight to the xenophobic, million-dollar campaign\\" of the Swiss People's Party. Methods like subversive affirmation, provocation and parody were used to gain the attention of the media which served as multipliers of the project. Superficially OLAF appeared to be a partner organization of the nationalist Swiss People's Party (SVP), which wanted to automatically expel all criminal foreigners through its deportation initiative. The vote was prepared by the SVP with the controversial Black-Sheep-Campaign and a suggestive survey of the Swiss population which led to accusations of inciting xenophobia and violating international law. However, OLAF even went one step further: in order to tackle the problem of foreigners at its roots, not only criminal foreigners should be deported, ‚Äì according to OLAF ‚Äì but all foreigners, because only foreigners can become criminal foreigners. In numerous propaganda videos, brochures and posters, OLAF took elements and arguments of the SVP's populist campaign and exaggerated them ad absurdum. Dr Alois Stocher quickly collected friends from the right-wing political spectrum on Facebook who did not see through the project as satire, but were enthusiastic about Stocher's radical ideas.cf.: * Provokation verbreitet sich im Internet, kampagnenpraxis.de, Report Nr. 31, 1 December 2010 * So sorgt Alois Stocher f√ºr rote K√∂pfe, Blick, 10 May 2011 * Dieses Gedankengut ist doch bei vielen vorhanden, 20min, 8 October 2010 OLAF's website (volksbefreiung.ch) was modelled on the SVP's campaign website (volksbefragung.ch) in terms of structure and aesthetics. Photomontages and ambiguous texts parodied the positions of the SVP and brought the Volkspartei close into line of the National Socialists.cf.: * ARD Tagesthemen, 21 November 2010 * SF Kulturplatz, 1 Dezember 2010 As a result, the actors received massive threats from both the political right and left, who took the project and persona seriously.  People's liberation  In order to liberate the Swiss population from foreign infiltration, OLAF's website also offered an online form which could be used to propose unwanted foreigners for deportation. It was then possible to follow live which foreigners received the most votes which was presented in form of \\"deportation charts\\". The 10 foreigners with the most votes would be directly expelled every week, OLAF promised.  National Collection Day for Foreigners  Dr. Alois B. Stocher and George Klein also made appearances in real life. The highlight of the OLAF campaign was the so-called \\"National Collection Day for foreigners\\" on the Bundesplatz in Bern where a yellow container was installed to collect and deport all foreigners who the Swiss population no longer wanted in the country.cf.: * Ausl√§nder markieren, sammeln, ausschaffen, BAZ, 4 November 2010 * Das Theater um die Politik, NZZ am Sonntag, 7 November 2010 * In den Container ‚Äì und weg, Der Bund, 8.11.2010 * Ausl√§nder sammeln auf dem Bundesplatz, Tages-Anzeiger, 4 November 2010 * Ausschaffung konkret: Alois Stocher verfrachtet Ausl√§nder in Abschiebe-Container, Radio RaBe, 8 November 2010 * Sammeltag f√ºr Ausl√§nder ‚Äì Protest gegen die Ausschaffungsinitiative, Radio Dreyeckland, 10 November 2010 In addition, there was a stand with information materials on OLAF and SVP, as well as armbands (sorted by cultural descent), which were used for the preventive marking of foreigners.  Press conference intervention and legal pursuits  The press conference on 9 November was announced by the SVP to present the results of their survey of the Swiss population on their resentments towards foreigners. As Alois B. Stocher entered the stage to present the solutions for the problems identified by the survey, he was forced to leave by the security staff. As a result, the SVP threatened a legal action against OLAF, as many media reported.cf.: * Attaques du site Olaf contre l ÃÅUDC: Christoph M√∂rgeli manque d ÃÅhumour, 24heures.ch, 15 November 2010 * L ÃÅUDC est en froid avec un site humoristique, 24heures, 15 November 2010 * Christoph M√∂rgeli n ÃÅaime pas l ÃÅhumour d ÃÅOlaf, 20min, 15 November 2010 However, this turned out to be another hoax, staged by OLAF.cf.: * Satire-Figur narrt Medien und Politiker, 20min, 16 November 2010 * Gruppe Olaf inszeniert M√∂rgeli-Klage, Blick am Abend, 15 November 2010  Reception  The project attracted considerable attention in the Switzerland and abroadcf.: * ARD Tagesthemen, 21 November 2010 * Black Sheep satire follows posters to limit, Worldradio, 20 November 2010 and was controversially discussed in online magazinescf.: * 3-Phasen-L√∂sung der Ausl√§nderfrage, swiss- lupe.blogspot.com, 20 August 2010 * Linke L√ºgen aufdecken, chblog.ch, 21 August 2010 * Vorsicht OLAF, plapperstorch.de, 21 September 2010 * Ausschaffungsinitiative: Ein heisser Kampf steht an, info8.ch, 6 October 2010 * Organisation zur L√∂sung der Ausl√§nderfrage, suite101.de * Satirische Aktion zur Ausschaffungsinitiative, amtlich.ch, 4 November 2010 * Das Neuste von OLAF: Alois B.

Early life Stewart was born in Glasgow to Scottish parents but moved to Canada shortly later. When he was 7 years old, his family moved again, this time to San Diego in California. He played college basketball for Santa Ana College and Cal State LA. Playing career =Professional career= After graduating, Stewart had a tryout with the Portland Trail Blazers. After failing to get a contract with the Blazers, he signed with USC Freiburg in West Germany. In August 1978, he signed with √çR of the Icelandic √örvalsdeild karla as a player-coach. In his first game for √çR, Stewart scored 46 points in a 100-88 victory against √çS in the pre-season Reykjav√≠k Basketball Tournament. He finished as the third highest scorer in the tournament with 166 points in 5 games. On 13 October, Stewart got into an altercation with Njar√∞v√≠k's Stef√°n Bjarkason in a game played at the Naval Air Station Keflavik which ended with both Military Police and Icelandic Police being called to the scene. After the fight, Stef√°n was transported to the base hospital where he received 6 stitches to his face. Although the game was part of an unofficial tournament, the Icelandic Basketball Federation disciplinary court suspended Stewart for three weeks which meant that he would miss two games in the √örvalsdeild, including a game against Njar√∞v√≠k. The verdict was highly controversial as it was only based on police statements from Stef√°n and Nar√∞v√≠k's assistant coach, Ingi Gunnarsson. Without Stewart, √çR defeated Njar√∞v√≠k, 95-89, with Stef√°n being booed loudly by the √çR fans whenever he touched the ball. As √çR's game against KR was postponed until December, allowing Stewart to play in it as his suspension was up. Although he was hampered by a knee injury for much of the season, Stewart averaged 26.8 points per game, good for fourth best in the league. In the Icelandic Cup, √çR advanced to the finals after beating Njar√∞v√≠k, 96-95, in the semi finals behind Stewart's and J√≥n J√∂rundsson's play. In the finals, √çR met KR in the Laugardalsh√∂ll. The game, which had heavy police presence due to violence by supporters in the stands at recent games, ended with a convincing 87-72 KR victory despite Stewart's 26 points. The following seasons he played for Team Fiat and Ovaltine in England. =National team career= In 1979, Stewart was selected to the Scottish national basketball team. On 30 April 1982, Stewart had 26 points and 18 rebounds in a 77-64 victory against Iceland in the EuroBasket 1983 qualification. Coaching career Stewart served as a player-coach for √çR during the 1978-1979 season. He was a candidate for the head coach position of the Icelandic men's national team for its 1979 games but the job ultimately went to Tim Dwyer.

Background Trumpeting Ecstasy is the band's first \\"solo\\" release in four years following back-to-back collaborative studio albums with Merzbow (Full of Hell & Merzbow) and The Body (One Day You Will Ache Like I Ache). Vocalist Dylan Walker says those collaborations had an impact on the creation of Trumpeting Ecstasy, elaborating: \\"We might not have been willing, or even able, to do some of the things that we were looking to do with the new record. Those guys gave us these nice extra toolsets ‚Äî like the idea of improvisation or having extra instrumentation outside of the normal rock band style.\\" Though the band hopes the lyrical themes will be interpreted by the listener however they choose, Walker said Trumpeting Ecstasy is about then-current events and also \\"kind of about man's small goods, like the small good actions being washed away by our species on a larger scale. If you looked at humanity on a long time line, I kind of feel like humanity got lost at its inception point.\\" Full of Hell also released the digital-only, four-track EP Trumpeting Ecstasy Remixes in May 2017. The EP notably includes a remix from Ben Chisholm, bassist for the gothic metal band Chelsea Wolfe. Critical reception The album was met with generally positive reviews from music critics. Writing for Exclaim!, Denise Falzon gave the album a perfect 10/10, concluding her review by claiming, \\"Trumpeting Ecstasy is the culmination of Full of Hell really coming into their own, exuding the confidence that comes along with refining their stylistic approach and honing their sound into something that is completely theirs.\\" Zoe Camp of Pitchfork gave the album a 7.7/10.0, stating, \\"Although Full of Hell spend the majority of Trumpeting Ecstasy examining their usual tricks through an expanded prism, their overall approach remains the same. They take a sweeping panorama of the abyss, compress it down to a single point, and shade it in until it breaks.\\" Both reviewers gave praise for Nicole Dollanganger's pop- influenced guest vocals on the album's title track, \\"Trumpeting Ecstasy\\".

In particular, Thierry Mayer has played a major role in the development of CEPII's GeoDist database (together with Soledad Zignago), which includes bilateral distances between population centres for 225 countries and thus allows for particularly comprehensive gravity models of trade.Mayer, T., Zignago, S. (2011). Notes on CEPII's distances measures: The GeoDist database. CEPII Working Paper Series. In his research, Mayer has frequently collaborated with Keith Head (University of British Columbia and his SciencesPo colleague Philippe Martin. = Research on international trade=  Research on trade barriers, border and home market effects, and offshoring A substantial part of Mayer's research, especially with Keith Head, centres on the topics of border, distance and home market effects, trade barriers, market potential and offshoring. Analyzing infra- European trade patterns in 1976-95, Mayer and Head find European consumers to act as if imports from other EU Member States were subject to high non-tariff barriers, with the removal of barriers by the Single Market Programme having almost no effect on market fragmentation, which in turn suggests that border effects within the EU were largely driven by consumers' home bias rather than barriers due to government action.Head, K., Mayer, T. (2000). Non-Europe: the magnitude and causes of market fragmentation in the EU. Review of World Economics, 136(2), pp. 284-314. In later research with Head, Mayer introduces a new measure for distance - \\"effective distance\\" - which adjusts distances between countries based on the distances between the regions of countries that trade with each other, weighted by their trade, and uses it to (partly) address the border effect puzzle.Head, K., Mayer, T. (2010). Illusory border effects: distance mismeasurement inflates estimates of home bias in trade. In: Van Bergeijk, P.A.G., Brakman, S. (eds.). The Gravity Model in International Trade: Advances and Applications. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, pp. 165-192. Together with John Ries, Mayer and Head argue that home market effects in trade models with imperfect competition occur because firms benefit more from locating in the largest market than they lose from moving to a market with many competitors and are surprisingly pervasive, showing their robustness to assuming CES demand, homogeneous goods, non-lambda-shaped trade costs, and price responsiveness to the proximity of competitors, though the effects disappear face to nation-specific differentiation.Head, K., Mayer, T., Ries, J. (2002). On the pervasiveness of home market effects. Economica, 69(275), pp. 371-390. Empirically, they have found that, even though they have been declining over time, distance costs in service trade remain sufficiently high to create a significant advantage for local workers in services.Head, K., Mayer, T., Ries, J. (2009). How remote is the offshoring threat? European Economic Review, 53(4), pp. 429-444. Studying the trade linkages of former colonies, they also find that within four decades of independence, trade linkages between both former colonies and the colonizing country as well as between countries formerly belonging to the same colonial empire have on average contracted by around two thirds, i.e., substantially more than with third countries, suggesting the depreciation of trade-related capital.Head, K., Mayer, T, Ries, J. (2010). The erosion of colonial trade linkages after independence. Journal of International Economics, 81(1), pp. 1-14. Finally, an important review of the pre-2014 literature on gravity models of trade for the Handbook of International Economics is also due to Mayer and Head.Head, K., Mayer, T. (2014). Gravity equations: Workhorse, toolkit, and cookbook. In: Gopinath, G., Helpman, E., Rogoff, K. (eds.). Handbook of International Economics, vol. 4. Amsterdam: Elsevier, pp. 131-195.  Research on market potential Mayer and Head find that market potential, i.e., the proximity of a country to large markets for exports, matters for the location choice of Japanese investors in the EU but cannot completely explain the tendency of firms in the same industry to agglomerate.Head, K., Mayer, T. (2004). Market potential and the location of Japanese investment in the European Union. Review of Economics and Statistics, 86(4), pp. 959-972. In further research on market potential, they reconcile the factor price and home market effects of market size and show how regional wages and employment in the EU respond to differentials in \\"real market potential\\".Head, K., Mayer, T. (2006). Regional wage and employment responses to market potential in the EU. Regional Science and Urban Economics, 36(5), pp. 573-594. Finally, more recently, Mayer and Head have shown market potential to have been a significant driver of global economic per capita growth over the 1965-2003 period.Head, K., Mayer, T. (2011). Gravity, market potential and development. Journal of Economic Geography, 11(2), pp. 281-294.  Other research on trade Other topics in Mayer's research on trade include the role of networks for interregional trade, the impact of trade relations on the probability of war, product quality sorting in trade, the reaction of exports to exchange rate movements, market access and the relationship between market size, competition and exporters' product mix. In their research on the role of networks for trade between French regions, Mayer, Pierre-Philippe Combes and Miren Lafourcade find that domestic migrants and firm networks respectively double and quadruple bilateral trade flows, which in turn strongly diminishes estimates of the effects of transport costs and administrative borders on interregional trade.Combes, P.P., Lafourcade, M., Mayer, T. (2005). The trade-creating effects of business and social networks evidence from France. Journal of International Economics, 66(1), pp. 1-29. Studying the effect of trade on war, Mayer, Philippe Martin and Mathias Thoenig find that bilateral trade integration reduces the probability of war between these two countries, especially if they are neighbours, but that this effect is mitigated by multilateral trade openness, as having strong trade relations with many other countries reduces a country's economic dependency on a given country.Martin, P., Mayer, T., Thoenig, M. (2008). Make trade not war? Review of Economic Studies, 75(3), pp. 865-900. In further research with Martin and Nicolas Berman, Mayer argues that exchange rate movements such as depreciations have only a weak impact on aggregate export volumes because the majority of exports concentrate among high productivity firms that tend to disproportionately absorb exchange rate movements through price markups rather than increases in export volumes.Berman, N., Martin, P., Mayer, T. (2012). How do different exporters react to exchange rate changes? Quarterly Journal of Economics, 127(1), pp. 437-492. This claim also matches earlier research with Gianmarco Ottaviano on the internationalization of European firms, wherein he and Mayer note that a few high-performing enterprises tend to drive countries' international performance, implying that policy aimed at fostering economic integration should focus on increasing the number of international firms (rather than increasing the involvement of already internationalized firms) by improving firms' performance in terms of productivity and employment.Mayer, T., Ottaviano, G.I.P. (2007). The Happy Few: The internationalisation of European Firms. New facts based on firm-level evidence. Intereconomics, 43(3), pp. 135-148. In another study with Ottaviano, Mayer and Marc Melitz observe that French export firms tend to concentrate their export product mix on their best performing products the higher the competition in the export market, which bears important implications for firm productivity growth.Mayer, T., Melitz, M.J., Ottaviano, G.I.P. (2014). Market size, competition, and the product mix of exporters. American Economic Review, 104(2), pp. 495-536. In recent research on quality sorting and trade among French champagne exporters, Mayer, Head and Matthieu Crozet show that the probability of market entry, export values and firm-level prices monotonically increase in quality.Crozet, M., Head, K., Mayer, T. (2011). Quality sorting and trade: Firm-level evidence for French wine. Review of Economic Studies, 79(2), pp. 609-644. Finally, together with Jos√© de Sousa and Soledad Zignago, Mayer has found that exporters in the Global South face 50% more difficulties in accessing developed markets than exporters in developed countries, though these difficulties have fallen by 95% between 1980 and 2006, with non-tariff barriers (and reductions therein) playing an important role.De Sousa, J., Mayer, T., Zignago, S. (2012). Market access in global and regional trade. Regional Science and Urban Economics, pp. 1037-1052. = Research on foreign direct investment= Investigating the location choices of French multinational firms in Eastern and Western Europe in 1980-99, Mayer and Anne- C√©lia Disdier find that, while institutional quality in the host country is important, agglomeration effects are less strong in non-EU countries of Central and Eastern Europe, with investors' East-West distinction of potential host countries decreasing over time.Disdier, A.C., Mayer, T. (2004). How different is Eastern Europe? Structure and determinants of location choices by French firms in Eastern and Western Europe. Journal of Comparative Economics, 32(2), pp. 280-296. In research on the institutional determinants of inward FDI in developing countries, Mayer, Agn√®s B√©nassy-Qu√©r√© and Maylis Coupet find a large effect of institutions such as bureaucracy, corruption, and legal institutions, with e.g. employment protection reducing FDI, as well as of institutional proximity between origin and destination countries, suggesting that improving the quality of institutions in developing countries is likely to strongly increase FDI inflows.B√©nassy-Qu√©r√©, A., Coupet, M., Mayer, T. (2007). Institutional determinants of foreign direct investment. World Economy, 30(5), pp. 764-782. Finally, studying the domestic effects on French firms of initiating production abroad in 1987-99, Mayer, Alexander Hijzen and S√©bastien Jean find the domestic effects to vary across types of FDI, with market-seeking FDI in manufacturing as well as FDI in services sectors resulting in domestic job creation due to scale effects and their market- seeking motive, whereas factor-seeking FDI has no impact on employment at home.Hijzen, A., Jean, S., Mayer, T. (2011). The effects at home of initiating production abroad: evidence from matched French firms. Review of World Economics, 147(3), pp. 457. = Research on firm clustering in France= Analyzing the agglomeration patterns of foreign firms in France, Mayer, Crozet and Jean-Louis Mucchielli observe positive spillovers between firms, patterns of clustering across firms from the same country and with the highest spillovers, and a \\"learning process\\" whereby FDI locations become increasingly distant from the country of origin (e.g. from Germany, Belgium, Switzerland or the Netherlands), but very little evidence for regional policies attempting to attract FDI to a particular location.Crozet, M., Mayer, T., Mucchieli, J.-L. (2004). How do firms agglomerate? A study of FDI in France. Regional Science and Urban Economics, 34(1), pp. 27-54. In further research on firm clusters in France, Martin and Florian Mayneris find that public policies promoting the development of industrial clusters - so-called \\"syst√®mes de production localis√©s\\" - have failed to reverse the relative decline in productivity for the firms it targeted, which had been selected specifically in depressed sectors and regions, and had no robust effect on employment or exports.Martin, P., Mayer, T., Mayneris, F. (2011). Public support to clusters: A firm level study of French \\"Local Productive Systems\\". Regional Science and Urban Economics, 41(2), pp. 108-123. However, analyzing the short-run effects of clustering on plant productivity in France, they find a positive effect for localization economies (though none for urbanization); while this lends support to cluster policies in general, their findings also suggest that French firms' location have already well internalized such advantages and further policy-induced clustering is unlikely to yield large gains in productivity.Martin, P., Mayer, T., Mayneris, F. (2011). Spatial concentration and plant-level productivity in France. Journal of Urban Economics, 69(2), pp. 182-195.  Bibliography Combes, P.P., Mayer, T., Thisse, J.-F. (2008).

Tokes, a twenty-one-year-old student at The Ohio State University, was abducted while leaving her job in Columbus‚Äôs downtown by Brian Golsby. Golsby robbed and raped Tokes, and forced her to drive to the Scioto Grove Metro Park. There, he forced her to strip naked and marched her into a field where he shot her twice in the head. Golsby had recently been released from prison where he had served a six-year sentence for kidnapping a pregnant woman and her child and raping the woman. He had pled down to robbery and attempted rape. He was staying at a temporary housing program. The officials at the housing program and his parole officer did not monitor him, and he violated probation and committed six robberies without being arrested before murdering Tokes. Golsby was convicted in March 2018 and sentenced to life in prison though prosecutors filed a cross-appeal, arguing that a legal error prevented him from getting the death penalty. In 2019 prosecutors were granted the authority to appeal. Oral arguments in front of Ohio's Tenth District Court of Appeals were held on July 30, 2020. The murder of Tokes received extensive media coverage in Central Ohio and was listed as one of region's top ten news stories in 2017 by The Columbus Dispatch. The case has received national attention as well, being featured on programs such as Dateline NBC and On the Case with Paula Zahn. Tokes's murder has also led to calls for changes in Ohio‚Äôs criminal justice system. In 2018 Governor John Kasich signed part of the Reagan Tokes Act into law. Tokes's family sued the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction (ODRC) and NIRSE Inc., the company whose program housed Golsby, arguing that their negligence and failure to monitor him led to Tokes's murder. Several courts dismissed the lawsuit against the ODRC and the Supreme Court of Ohio declined to hear the Tokes' case against the department. The lawsuit against NIRSE Inc. remains pending, and a trial was set to begin in 2020. The lawsuit was later settled. Background =Reagan Tokes= Reagan Delaney Tokes was born on March 13, 1995, in Edgewood, Kentucky, United States, to parents Toby Tokes and Lisa McCrary-Tokes. She was raised in Maumee in Monclova Township and graduated from Anthony Wayne High School where she had a 4.5 GPA and played on the varsity lacrosse and tennis teams. The year she began college, her parents and younger sister Makenzie moved to Florida. Tokes stayed in Ohio and began attending The Ohio State University, where she had wanted to go since she was a child. She originally majored in pre-med but changed her major to psychology. She planned on graduating in May 2017 and moving to Cleveland where she hoped to work at the Cleveland Clinic. Tokes also planned to attend graduate school, get another degree in psychology or psychiatry, and open up her own psychology practice. Days before being murdered she posted on social media about picking out a frame for her diploma. Tokes worked at Bodega, a restaurant and bar in Columbus's Short North neighborhood. =Brian Golsby= Brian Golsby was born in 1988. He says that he had an abusive mother and was affected by drug and alcohol abuse. He also claims to have experienced a rape in his youth, though prosecutors dispute this because the stories he gave were inconsistent. Golsby started committing crimes as a juvenile. These crimes include criminal trespassing, receiving stolen property, theft, shoplifting, criminal damaging, and threatening his mother with a knife. According to a juvenile sex offender assessment filed by the Ohio Department of Youth Services, Golsby raped five-year-old girls and six-year-old boys and was a member of the Crips gang during his youth. In November 2010, Golsby abducted a woman who was eight months pregnant and her two-year-old son. As the victim was getting her child out of her car, he came up behind her and put a knife to her throat. Police say he also threatened the child's life. Golsby orally raped the woman in front of the child and forced her to drive him to several ATMs to withdraw money. He then forced her to drive him to her home where he again orally raped her and stole her DVD-player. The victim refused to testify, fearing for her and her children's lives, so Golsby pleaded down to robbery and attempted rape in May 2011. He was sentenced to six years in prison for the robbery charge and six years for the attempted rape charge. The sentences ran concurrently, meaning that he would be incarcerated for a total of six years rather than twelve years. The six months he had spent in jail prior to the plea bargain counted as a part of his six-year sentence, so instead of being released six years after the plea in May 2017, he was released five and a half years later in November 2016. While in prison, Golsby committed fifty-two infractions, including possessing contraband, refusing to obey orders, stealing, fighting, and creating disturbances. His behavior was so problematic that he was moved to new prisons several times. He ended up serving his sentence in five different prisons. He was released on November 13, 2016, and had to register as a Tier III sex offender. Upon release, Golsby was given a GPS tracking device by a re-entry program for ex-offenders called Alvis. Alvis did not actively monitor him. Golsby could not be placed in Alvis's re-entry program due to his criminal history and his history of violence while in prison. He was placed at a temporary housing center that was run by the EXIT Program. Like Alvis, officials working for the EXIT Program did not monitor him. They allowed him to come and go as he wanted and did not check his whereabouts. His only limitation was to be at the housing center between 10:00 pm and 6:00 am. According to the EXIT Program's founder, Golsby had a pass to leave the house during what he claimed were his work-hours. Golsby's parole officer did not monitor him either. Golsby violated parole several times and committed six robberies without being sent to jail or prison. The parole violations, which included letting the battery on his GPS bracelet die, and spending several nights away from the Exit Program's housing center, were considered \\"non severe\\" and did not warrant immediate sanctions. After his third violation, a hearing, which could have resulted in him being sent back to prison, was scheduled for February 23. The robberies Golsby committed include: * January 24 ‚Äì He robbed a woman of $3 at knifepoint. * January 27 ‚Äì He robbed a woman for some gift cards. * February 1 ‚Äì He robbed a man, taking $20. * February 2 ‚Äì He abducted a man and forced him to drive to an ATM at gunpoint. He robbed the man of $500. * February 6 ‚Äì He pistol- whipped a woman and took $38. * February 7 ‚Äì He robbed a woman, taking her purse and bag. The crime On the evening of February 8, 2017, Tokes went to work at Bodega in downtown Columbus, Ohio. Golsby spent the evening roaming Columbus looking for a victim. GPS data shows that he walked around OSU's campus and to North High Street. At North High Street, he got on a COTA bus and traveled to the downtown. He then spent about an hour walking around in circles near Bodega. At about 9:45 pm Tokes left Bodega and walked to her car. She ran into Golsby who forced her into her car at gunpoint and abducted her. During his interrogation, Golsby said he told Tokes that all he wanted was money and that everything would be all right. Golsby forced Tokes to drive him to two ATMs to withdraw money, but the transactions were declined. They stopped at the first ATM, a Chase Bank one, at 10:02, and tried to withdraw $500. The second ATM they stopped at was a Huntington Bank one at 10:14. At 10:18 Tokes and Golsby stopped in an alley and stayed there for twelve minutes. This is where Golsby is believed to have raped Tokes. After the rape, he made her drive back to the first ATM and forced her to withdraw $60. Tokes and Golsby also stopped at two gas stations, a Sunoco station at 11:12 and a Turkey Hill station at 11:41. Golsby decided to murder Tokes to prevent her from reporting the crimes he had committed against her. In his interrogation, he admitted that she begged for her life, telling him ‚Äúall I want to do is live.‚Äù Prosecutors believe that Tokes complied with her kidnapper's commands in order to survive. Golsby made her drive to the Scioto Grove Metro Park. There, he had her park the car and take off all of her clothing and her shoes. He then marched Tokes into a field and shot her twice in the head. She was shot once in the back of her head and once through the left side of her face. Golsby shot her at close range, killing her execution-style. After murdering Tokes, Golsby took her silver Acura to his girlfriend‚Äôs home. Golsby and his girlfriend went to McDonald‚Äôs together at 1:45 am and he gave her Tokes‚Äôs black Kate Spade purse and white wallet as a gift. He later disposed of the gun and shell casings in a sewer and unsuccessfully tried to set Tokes's car on fire to destroy evidence. Criminal proceedings =Investigation= Before being kidnapped, while Tokes was at Bodega, she texted her father saying that she would call him after she left work. When Tokes didn't call, her parents became worried. They spent the night trying to call and text her on her phone but she did not answer. At around 2:00 am Tokes's phone went dead. On February 9, her parents learned that she had not attended her classes. A missing person report was filed and news of her disappearance was spread via social media. The day after Tokes's murder, a park-goer discovered her naked body and called the police. A tattoo and a necklace helped detectives find out who the body belonged to. Tokes's body was later officially identified by her uncle who lived nearby. A forensic pathologist later testified at trial that two bullets were recovered from Tokes's head during an autopsy. The pathologist also said that one of the gunshot wounds Tokes suffered was fired at close range, which is supported by another forensic pathologist's testimony that her DNA was inside the barrel of the gun. A digital reader that was likely attached to a commercial vehicle captured the front license plate of Tokes's car after Golsby abandoned it. The information gathered was put into a data base that police later accessed. Investigators then found the car in southeast Columbus. In the back of the car and on the ground next to it were cigarette butts with Golsby‚Äôs DNA. Also inside the car was a gas can. Detectives found that a similar one had been purchased the night of Tokes‚Äôs murder, and obtained a photograph of Golsby buying it. Golsby‚Äôs GPS bracelet placed him in the locations Tokes had been-- in the street where she parked her car, at the ATMs, and at the park. Along with the cigarette butts, more DNA evidence against Golsby came from the rape kit performed on Tokes‚Äôs body. Gunshot residue was also found on Golsby's clothing. =Arrest= Golsby was arrested on February 11 at around 4:00 am by SWAT officers and was interrogated by Detective Rick Forney. He confessed to forcing Tokes to drive to ATMs to make withdrawals and to forcing her to drive to the park. He told detectives that once they were at the park he ordered Tokes to get out of the car and undress and then left her there. He initially denied having sexual contact with her and having a gun. Detectives then devised a new strategy. They suggested to Golsby that he must have had an accomplice. Golsby then made up a story where a man named \\"T.J.\\" demanded money from him and told him he would harm his children if he didn‚Äôt give him any. He said that T.J. forced him to rape Tokes at gunpoint. \\"I wanted to just run and call the cops, for real. I could have, but at the same time, I didn't want to put my babies in jeopardy,\\" Golsby told detectives. At the park, \\"T.J.\\" forced Tokes to undress and shot her in the head. Though detectives knew Golsby was lying about the accomplice, they pretended to believe him, causing him to lead them to more evidence. While in jail, Golsby confessed to a friend and to the mother of his child that he murdered Tokes. =Trial= Jury selection for the trial began on February 23, 2018. Defense attorneys had requested a change of venue due to the extensive media coverage surrounding the case, but Judge Mark Serrott denied it. The trial began on March 5, 2018. Franklin County District Attorney Ron O‚ÄôBrien told jurors in his opening statement that Tokes experienced a ‚Äúnight of terror‚Äù and that she was ‚Äúa psychology major who never made it to graduation because she was executed at point-blank range by a handgun.‚Äù On the second day, jurors were given a tour of where Tokes went the night of her murder, including Bodega and the Scioto Grove Metro Park. They viewed crime scene photos and heard from the witness who discovered Tokes‚Äôs body and from a detective. They also heard from three of Tokes‚Äôs roommates, who testified about the night she went missing and identified the Kate Spade purse Golsby stole from her. On March 7, jurors heard from the ex-girlfriend whom Golsby gave Tokes‚Äôs purse to, along with an Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation agent and an Adult Parole Authority employee. On March 8, prosecutors showed a video of Golsby‚Äôs interrogation with Detective Forney. In addition to the video, Detective Forney gave testimony. On the final day of trial, forensic scientists testified that Golsby‚Äôs sperm was found in Tokes's body and that Tokes‚Äôs DNA was inside the gun barrel. Golsby‚Äôs friend and the mother of his child also testified about his confessions to them. Franklin County deputy coroner Dr. Donald Pojman described the two gunshot wounds Tokes suffered, one of which was the result of a pistol being pressed to her temple. During closing arguments, prosecutors argued that Golsby murdered Tokes to avoid being caught. Defense counsel argued in their closing arguments that Golsby was not smart enough to plan Tokes's murder and instead killed her as a result of panic. Golsby was convicted on all counts on March 13, which would have been Tokes's twenty- third birthday. When it came to determining the penalty, the jury could not agree. Four voted for life in prison and eight voted for death. Judge Mark Serrot sentenced Golsby to life in prison on March 21. During the sentencing, Serrott told Golsby that his life was spared because of his upbringing yet Tokes's life wasn't. \\"Reagan did nothing wrong, whatsoever, and yet she forfeited her life because of your background. You get spared because of your background, and yet she forfeited her life.\\" After being sentenced to life in prison, he pleaded guilty to six robberies that occurred before Tokes‚Äôs murder. Golsby is currently incarcerated at the Ohio State Penitentiary, a supermax prison in Youngstown. =Appeals= Golsby's appellate lawyers requested an appeal in 2018 soon after his conviction but decided to drop it. Franklin County District Attorney Ron O'Brien is still seeking the death penalty for Golsby. In 2018 O'Brien filed a fifty-three-page motion, along with over one-hundred pages of exhibits, requesting a cross-appeal. O‚ÄôBrien and other prosecutors argue that a legal error allowed Golsby to escape the death penalty. They say that during the penalty phase of Golsby's trial, Judge Serrott erred in his instructions to the jury by telling them that the defense had no burden of proof when introducing mitigating factors. According to prosecutors, this error meant that jurors considered mitigating factors presented by the defense that had never in fact happened. For example, prosecutors dispute Golsby's claim that he experienced a rape as a child because he changed his story several times. At some points, he claimed he was ten-years-old when the rape occurred. At other times, he claimed he was twelve-years-old when he was raped, and in other instances he said he was raped at age thirteen. Prosecutors say that he also gave inconsistent information about the location of the rape, saying that it happened in a store, behind a store, and on the street. O‚ÄôBrien and Steven Taylor, the chief of his appellate division, wrote in their request that ‚Äúthere were ample reasons to pursue the death penalty‚Äù and that Golsby is a \\"remorseless recidivist violent offender prone to rape and robbery and now aggravated murder.‚Äù They said that ‚Äúgiven the many crimes committed by the defendant (Golsby), the life-without-parole sentence for the aggravated murder can be viewed as a failure of justice that warrants correction upon showing of legal error.\\" In January 2019, O'Brien and Taylor asked the appeals court to expedite the appeal. In February 2019, during a pre-trial hearing for another capital murder defendant, O'Brien mentioned the appeals court delay saying the court ‚Äúhas done zero on it.‚Äù On April 30, 2019, Ohio's Tenth District Court of Appeals granted the State's authority to appeal. On July 30, 2020, oral arguments were made in front of Ohio's Tenth District Court of Appeals. Aftermath =Memorial and legacy= Tokes's funeral was held on February 15, 2017, at the Maumee United Methodist Church. She was buried at Fort Meigs Cemetery in Maumee, Ohio. Tokes's family started the Reagan Tokes Memorial Foundation after her death. The foundation works to reward students with scholarships, teach self-defense, and promote legislation aimed at reducing crime. Tokes, who would have graduated from The Ohio State University with a degree in psychology in May 2017, was awarded a posthumous degree. On May 7, during OSU‚Äôs graduation ceremony, Tokes‚Äôs parents and sister accepted it. Shortly after Tokes‚Äôs murder, a rock garden memorial was created for her in the Scioto Grove Metro Park. It was dismantled by Columbus Metro Parks authority in May 2018. A new tranquility garden in Tokes‚Äôs memory was created by the park and was officially dedicated to her on June 5, 2019. It includes two large swings, paved paths, and over one-thousand plants including beebalm, boxwood, and five Buckeye trees to celebrate Tokes‚Äôs connection to The Ohio State University. The garden also has a Celtic symbol for love and a pond with birds and frogs. The plaque for the park has Tiffany Blue, Tokes‚Äôs favorite color, and says \\"In memory of a life so beautifully lived and a heart so deeply loved.\\" When viewed from above, the garden resembles an angel. \\"Knowing this (the park) is here, even though we live a long, long ways away in Florida, this is going to make us be a little bit more at peace with this place where... where Reagan just wanted to live,\\" Tokes‚Äôs father said during the dedication ceremony. Tokes‚Äôs mother told the local news that she ‚Äúused to have this crushing sensation where I almost couldn‚Äôt breathe when we would pull in (to the park) and I don‚Äôt feel that any longer.\\" McCrary-Tokes also said that ‚Äúthe pain and the tragedy never goes away, and we carry that with us every day. But we need to keep moving forward and there is still an amazing, beautiful world out there, and we have to learn how to move forward. And we carry her with us in our hearts every day and that will never change.‚Äù Another memorial was created for Tokes on The Ohio State University campus in June 2018. A yellow magnolia tree and a bronze plaque bearing her name are on the north edge of Mirror Lake. =Civil litigation= In May 2018, the Tokes family filed a lawsuit against the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction (ODRC) and NISRE Inc., which is the parent company of the EXIT Program that housed Golsby. The lawsuit argues that the ODRC and the EXIT Program were negligent and failed to adequately monitor Golsby, leading to Tokes‚Äôs murder. ‚ÄúFor two hours prior to her death, Reagan Tokes was kidnapped and brutally raped. During this time she suffered conscious pain and suffering. The suffering of Reagan Tokes was the result of the negligence of NISRE/Exit program.‚Äù The lawsuit also states that the Tokes family has suffered ‚Äúgrave mental anguish.‚Äù The lawsuit against the ODRC was dismissed by Judge Patrick McGrath in September 2018, with McGrath saying that the ODRC had no duty to prevent Golsby from harming Tokes because they had no special relationship with her. The Tokeses then appealed McGrath's decision. The lawsuit was again dismissed by Ohio's Tenth District Court of Appeals. On May 21, 2019, the Tokes family appealed to the Supreme Court of Ohio. The lawsuit says that the ODRC was \\"indeed aware Golsby posed a 'substantial risk of harm to others' and ignored it.\\" It also says that a special relationship existed between the ODRC and Golsby because of their knowledge that he represented a substantial risk of harm to others and that the ODRC had the ability to control him. \\"DRC was literally tied to Golsby's ankle. DRC had the full mantel of control over Golsby with the ultimate power to arrest him or impose more restrictive terms of post-release control.\\" Ohio‚Äôs Supreme Court announced on August 6, 2019, that they would not hear the Tokes' case against the ODRC. The justices voted six to one not to accept it with Justice Michael P. Donnelly dissenting. The Tokes' lawsuit against NISRE Inc., however, remains pending in the Franklin County Common Pleas Court. The trial is set to begin in 2020. =Legal reforms= Tokes‚Äôs parents began working with lawmakers to address what they see as the systemic failures that led to her murder. In 2018, the Reagan Tokes Act was introduced in the Ohio House and Senate. In December 2018, part of the Reagan Tokes Act was signed into law by Governor John Kasich. The portion of the Reagan Tokes Act that became law in 2018 requires judges to sentence offenders responsible for class one and two felonies (which are the most serious felonies in Ohio) to a range of years in prison consisting of a minimum term and a maximum term. If the offender is being sentenced for a single offense the maximum term is the minimum term plus fifty percent. For example, a judge imposes a minimum term of four years. The maximum term would be four years plus fifty percent, which is two years. The maximum term would, therefore, be six years. If the offender is given several terms to be served concurrently or consecutively the maximum sentence adds fifty percent of the longest minimum term for the most serious felony they are being sentenced for. Under the Reagan Tokes Act, offenders are presumed to be released at the end of the minimum term. To extend the prison term, the ODRC must hold an administrative hearing and find that the inmate engaged in improper conduct and is a continued threat to society, was placed in extended restrictive housing, and/or was classified as a level three, four, five or higher security level. In a written statement, State Rep. Kristin Boggs said: ‚ÄúThis legislation is the first step to make Ohio safer by ensuring that the most violent offenders who have demonstrated while in prison that they continue to pose a danger to society, are not automatically released back into our neighborhoods.‚Äù The act also allows the ODRC to reduce an offender's sentence by five to fifteen percent for exceptional conduct or adjustment to incarceration with approval from a sentencing court. The ODRC can recommend that an inmate's sentence be reduced, and a judge would be required to hold a hearing about the recommendation. The prosecuting attorney must be notified of the hearing. The prosecutor is to then notify the victim of the inmate, who has the right to participate in the hearing. The judge can overturn the ODRC's decision, and if the judge does grant the offender a reduced sentence, the victim and the prosecutor's office must be notified. Under the act, sex offenders cannot receive reduced sentences. The act also calls on the ODRC to write a feasibility study on ways to reduce the number of prisoners who are released homeless and improve GPS monitoring. The Reagan Tokes Act went into effect on March 21, 2019. After the first part of the Reagan Tokes Act passed, lawmakers were expected to re-introduce the other components of it in 2019. In April 2019, the next section of the Reagan Tokes Act, which addresses the monitoring of criminals, was re-introduced at the Ohio Statehouse. It reduces the caseload burdens on parole officers and requires the state to create a re- entry program for violent and sexual predators who are often rejected by other programs and halfway houses. It also addresses the GPS monitoring of felons under post-release control. =Media coverage= Tokes's murder and the subsequent legal reforms it resulted in garnered extensive media coverage in Central Ohio. The Columbus Dispatch listed the case as being one of the region's top ten news stories in 2017. The murder of Tokes has also received national media coverage. Dateline NBC aired an episode about it in June 2019. The case was also featured on On the Case with Paula Zahn and True Crime Daily.

It is one of the most well-known and influential speeches by Lindgren. Astrid Lindgren speaks against corporal punishment of children. A year later, in Lindgren's home country Sweden, a law was released that forbid corporal punishment of children. In 1978 the speech was first published as a book under the German title Astrid Lindgren: Ansprachen anl√§sslich der Verleihung des Friedenspreises des Deutschen Buchhandels (Friedenspreis des Deutschen Buchhandels). Later the book was also published in many different languages. In 2009 a German short film called Never Violence (original title: Niemals Gewalt) had been published at Children's Day. It was based on the story mentioned in Lindgrens speech.  Speech  On 22 October 1978 Astrid Lindgren made an acceptance speech while she received the Peace Prize of the German Book Trade. In her speech at the Frankfurter Paulskirche she supported non- violent upbringing. During that time in Germany there was still a law for the parental right of corporal punishment. = Content = Astrid Lindgren begins by saying that as long as man has lingered on this earth, there has been violence and war. True peace, on the other hand, does not exist on earth. Politicians talk about disarmament, but not about their own, instead about those of other countries. Astrid Lindgren asks why so many people seek power or revenge and want violence. She does not believe that these people are evil by nature. Therefore, she wonders how people can learn to oppose violence. She thinks that people have to start with the children. She believes that most dictators have experienced violence, humiliation, insults, and exposures, and pass on this behaviour. Those to whom the children are entrusted decide whether they give them love or violence, which those children later pass on. She explains that free and unauthorized education does not mean that children should be allowed to do whatever they want, and that behavioural norms and rules must also be applied to in this form of education. A loving respect for each other is something she wishes for both, children and parents. Then Lindgren tells a story she has heard from an old lady. When the lady was a young mother, her son had done something that, in her opinion, required severe punishment. She asked the boy to pick up a stick and bring it to her. It took long time until the boy came back with a stone. He was crying. When he explained that he had not found a stick, but she could throw him the stone after him, the mother realized what the boy must have felt. He must have thought she just wanted to hurt him, and she could also do that with a stone. She cried and hugged the child. Later, she put the stone onto a shelf. It should serve her as a warning never to use violence. Astrid Lindgren believes children would notice the atrocities, violence and oppressions that exist around the world. Therefore, it is important to show them that things can be different. Maybe everyone should put a stone on the kitchen shelf as a warning never to use any violence. It could serve peace in the world. = Background = When receiving the Peace Prize of the German Book Trade, on 22 October 1978, Astrid Lindgren wanted to make a speech about non-violent upbringing. At that time parental violence was still considered normal in Germany. Astrid Lindgren had to submit the speech to the committee in advance. She was advised only to accept the price, without making any speech. The organizer found the speech was too provocative. Astrid Lindgren insisted on keeping her speech as it was, otherwise she wouldn't have come. = Impacts of the speech = Lindgren's speech was soon spread worldwide. In her home country Sweden, Astrid Lindgren teamed up with scientists, journalists and politicians to achieve non-violent upbringing. In 1979, due to Astrid Lindgren's speech, a law was introduced in Sweden prohibiting violence against children. Until then there was no such law anywhere in the world. After Sweden, other Nordic countries followed Lindgren's role model. According to article 1631 II of the B√ºrgerliches Gesetzbuch, children in Germany only have the ‚Äûright to a non- violent upbringing‚Äú since 2000. Nevertheless, Lindgren's speech also made people think. Because of her speech more scientists where interested in exploring the consequences of violence on children. They could late confirm Lindgren's theses. According to criminologist Christian Pfeiffer, this made people change their opinions about that matter and ultimately led to the change of the law in 2000. After Sweden, many other countries around the world, have made laws, that forbid violence against children. Nepal is now the 54th state that forbid violence against children. As of 2019 Sweden still is working on a program called Never Violence, a programme to strengthen international efforts to legislate against corporal punishment of children at home and school.  Book  Never Violence (original title: Niemals Gewalt!) is the title of a book about Astrid Lindgrens famous speech. = Content = The book contains the complete speech (see also the content of the speech). In addition, a foreword, as well as an epilogue and a timeline about the life of Astrid Lindgren were added. = Background = The speech was first published in a book in 1978 in Germany and in Sweden. Since then the speech has been published many times. The speech in the different editions always stayed the same, however the text accompanying the book changed. In Sweden, a new edition book was published in 2018. It was titled Aldrig v√•ld!. It contained Lindgren's entire speech.

She wishes that everyone would read it and most important live it. Stephanie M√ºller thinks it is frightening to see how well Lindgren's speech still fits in our time today. She believes that this should be read and internalized by people over and over again. Stephanie Streif of the Badische Zeitung believes, that the little book is dedicated to ‚Äûa very big, important topic‚Äú: ‚Äûchildren's rights‚Äú. Luette Lotte finds that at first the book seems inconspicuous and small, but its content is deeply moving and makes people think. = Editions = * Astrid Lindgren (2014): œÄŒøœÑŒ≠ Œ≤ŒØŒ±!

Short film  Never Violence (original title: Niemals Gewalt) is a short film by David Aufdembrinke. It is based on the story told by Astrid Lindgren during her speech. = Plot = A boy watches his neighbour baking a strawberry cake. He steals the strawberry cake and eats it. However, he is discovered by the neighbour. She brings him to his mother and tells her to punish her son. The mother tells her son to go outside and get a stick. When it gets dark, the boy is still not back. The mother runs into the forest and calls for him. But her son does not answer. Then she runs to the phone. Just when she wants to make a call, her son comes back. He says that he is sorry. The mother explains that the most important thing is that he is back. The boy tells his mother he could not find a stick. Instead, he gives her a big stone. He adds that she could hurt him with that to. The mother looks at him in horror, puts the stone aside and hugs her boy. The stone is placed on the windowsill and the words ‚ÄûNever Violence‚Äú appear. = Background = The film crew needed more than a year to develop the film. Later the film was made with a budget of 3,000 euros, within three days in Steinberg-Haff und Emkendorf in Schleswig-Holstein. At first it was considered to relocate history to the present day. The mother should have been a single parent and should have come from a precarious situation. But that would have let into many viewers seeing violence as a problem of others. Instead, the film crew wanted to portray violence from a child's point of view. Director David Aufdembrinke explained that it is a child who does everything to gain his mothers love. He adds that it was important for him to demonstrate that children who experience violence perceive it as something completely normal and pass it on to others. If violence is a strange thing for them, one can hope for a peaceful future. The film was released on the Internation Children's Day at 20 September 2009 by the DAGO Kinderlobby (DAGO Children's Lobby) in cooperation with the Deutsche Liga f√ºr das Kind (German League for the Child in Family and Society). These two organizations work for the rights of young people. It was the first film role for the main actor Justus Herold. In 2010, the film was shown at the Sardinia Film Festival in Sardinia. The Stiftung Kinderschutz Schweiz (Swiss Foundation for Child Protection) showed the film on their website during the international No Hitting Day. = Reception = Sandra Sch√§fer of the Berliner Morgenpost believes that the story would be timeless through the choice of images and the rural environment. In addition, the film would strongly remind the viewer of the world of Astrid Lindgren's characters. Franziska Falkenberg from Hamburger Abendblatt praises cinematographer Lilli Thalgot, who captures ‚Äûthe child's perspective in an impressive way‚Äú. Her pictures speak for themselves and touch ‚Äûthe viewer in harmony with Oliver Heuss' music deeply.‚Äú Sophie L√ºttich from Berlinfreckles.de explained that the film moved her deeply and made her think. The shortfilm received the Main Taunus Award at the Shorts at Moonlight Filmfestival 2010.

The casino has of gaming space with 1,200 slot machines and 50 table games. The hotel has 395 rooms in an 18-story tower. History Plans for the casino were first revealed in June 2011, when Isle of Capri Casinos announced an option agreement to sell one of its two riverboats in Lake Charles, along with the accompanying casino license, to developers who planned to move the license to Bossier City as part of a $170-million resort project. The developers were Paul Alanis (owner of the Silver Slipper Casino in Mississippi) and William Trotter (former co-owner of Evangeline Downs racetrack and casino). Alanis gave more details about the planned resort later that month, including that it would be affiliated with Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville brand. Voters in Bossier Parish approved the casino in a November 2011 election. In February 2012, the developers completed their purchase of the Isle of Capri boat and license for $15 million, and construction began, with a Tutor Perini subsidiary as the general contractor. The casino was built as a barge floating in a pool with of water pumped in from the Red River, to comply with Louisiana's riverboat casino law. The project ultimately cost $205 million to develop. The casino opened for a one-day preview event on June 13, 2013, and then opened permanently two days later. In 2016, the Poarch Band of Creek Indians agreed to purchase the resort, which they planned to rename under their \\"Wind Creek\\" casino brand. The sale was canceled, however, because of a dispute between the owners and Margaritaville Holdings regarding payments for the Margaritaville name. In 2019, Vici Properties bought the land and buildings for $261 million, while Penn National Gaming purchased the property's operating business for $115 million and leased it from Vici for $23 million per year.

Russia German resettlers in Germany  During the advance of the Red Army in the course of World War II, many Black Sea Germans, who had fallen under National Socialist dominion, were relocated by the Nazi SS to Warthegau. They received German citizenship (\\"administrative resettlers\\"), but after the end of the war they were forcibly repatriated to Russia. Only in the context of Ostpolitik could more than 70,000 Russian Germans move to Germany in the 1970s and 1980.Landsmannschaft der Deutschen aus Russland: Zeittafel von der Auswanderung nach Russland bis zur Gr√ºndung der Landsmannschaft.

In some cases the alleged criminal dies in the process due to excessive beating or they are set on fire using old car tires and fuel. Mob justice, also known as ‚Äòinstant justice‚Äô or ‚Äòjungle justice‚Äô, occurs in various towns and cities in Ghana. According to the laws of Ghana, this act is illegal and intolerable, but it occurs at an increasing rate. People who engage in this act are usually onlookers or people passing by or an organized group also known as \\"community vigilantes\\" whose aim is to protect the community from criminals. In Ghana, it is not only alleged criminals that sometimes face mob justice; people suspected to be witches, wizards, adulterers and homosexuals sometimes find themselves in such situations. Due to the lack of trust in the law enforcement system in Ghana people resort to taking the law into their own hands and deal with these alleged criminals their own way.  Reasons for mob justice  From various research and surveys, people attributed the action of mob justice to; * The legal system being slow and the courts adjourning cases when there is empirical evidence on a crime committed. The delays in the court process of dealing with alleged criminals when there is hard core evidence does not sit well with the public, hence they prefer to handle criminals their own way than to hand them over to the police. The people are usually impatient when it comes to the justice delivery system in Ghana. * Punishment given to criminals does not deter them and others from committing crimes. In order to serve as a deterrent to others from committing crimes in a community the public thinks apprehended criminals do not face long jail terms or severe punishment. Hence, they seek to mob justice to send a message to other criminals in the community and the victims as well. * The police and the judicial systems are seen to be corrupt, therefore criminals are not dealt with properly and they are later found walking on the streets freely. The public believes that these criminals have acquaintance with the police and when they are apprehended, they are left to go within a short time. With this lack of trust in the police, people in communities tend to take matters into their own hands in order to seek justice for themselves. * When people do not know what happens to convicted criminals and also when sentences given to them are not reasonable. With the lack of information and transparency from law enforcement, the people prefer to deal with suspected persons themselves than to hand them over to the police. In the journal Implication of mob justice practice among communities in Ghana a survey conducted by Ernest Adu-Gyamfi on 1,000 people, including males and females, in the Kumasi Metropolis which is the capital city of the Ashanti Region, consist of 20 suburbs and people who are 18 years and above. 51% of the respondents in the survey have secondary education while 23.7% have tertiary education. In response to the causes of mob justice, 47.9% strongly agree that delay in justice is a major cause of the action in the metropolis, 45% agree and 4% disagree with that claim. With the aspect of prolonged police investigations as one of the causes of mob justice, 63.7% strongly agree and 30% agree. 81.2% of the respondents strongly agree that they are not satisfied with the sentences sometimes emitted to convicted criminals and 18.8% strongly disagree with the dissatisfaction level of criminal sentence. On the claim of the judicial and police service being corrupt and being the cause of mod justice, 44.4% strongly agree and 55.6% strongly disagree. Also, 79.5% strongly agree to mob justice serving as a deterrent to other criminals. For the claim that people who are involved in the act of mob justice are ignorant and not aware that their actions are illegal and strip victims of fundamental human rights, 84.9% strongly disagree and 15.1% agree with this claim. With this assertion, perpetrators of this act are fully aware of the consequences of their actions but still engage in the act of mob justice.  Laws against mob justice  Mob Justice is a criminal offence pursuant to Act 29 of the Criminal Code of 1960 which covers the various aspect of mob justice. * Section 46 ‚ÄúWhoever commits murder shall be liable to suffer death‚Äù. * Section 47 ‚ÄúWhoever intentionally causes the death of another person by any unlawful harm is guilty of murder, unless his crime is reduced to manslaughter by reason of such extreme provocation, or other matter of partial excuse‚Äù. * Section 48 ‚ÄúWhoever attempts to commit murder shall be guilty of first degree felony‚Äù. * Section 69 ‚ÄúWhoever intentionally and unlawfully causes harm to any person shall be guilty of second degree felony‚Äù. * Section 84 ‚ÄúWhoever unlawfully assaults any person is guilty of a misdemeanor‚Äù. Also Chapter 5 of the constitution of Ghana protects the fundamental human rights and freedoms of a person. Article 13 states that ‚ÄúNo person shall be deprived of his life intentionally except in the exercise of the execution of a sentence of a court in respect of a criminal offence under the laws of Ghana of which he has been convicted‚Äù. Article 15 talks about \\"RESPECT FOR HUMAN DIGNITY\\" and that; * ‚ÄúThe dignity of all persons shall be inviolable‚Äù. * ‚ÄúNo person shall, whether or not he is arrested, restricted or detained, be subjected to; torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; any other condition that detracts or is likely to detract from his dignity and worth as a human being‚Äù. Article 19 requires FAIR TRIAL for; * ‚ÄúA person charged with a criminal offence is given a fair hearing within a reasonable time by a court‚Äù. * ‚ÄúA person charged with a criminal offence is presumed to be innocent until he is proved or has pleaded guilty‚Äù. All the above mentioned are legal provisions that protects suspected criminals from the act of mob justice or instant justice.

It was home to Providence Dry Dock and Marine Railway Co. around the turn of the 20th century, and today is home to Bold Point Park. History Bold Point is located in the Watchemoket area of East Providence. The Wampanoags used the shallow water by Bold Point as a ford across the Seekonk River. India Point, on the other side of the river, was Providence's first port, which remained active from 1680 until the Great Depression in the early 20th century. Its success was in part due to the large trading businesses of John Brown and his partner, John Francis, who set up in Providence in 1787. Brown built a bridge between India Point and Watchemoket in 1793, while the latter was still part of Rehoboth, Massachusetts. Bold Point was home to maritime businesses including Providence Dry Dock and Marine Railway Co., which operated two patent slips and the first floating dry dock in Narragansett Bay. According to The Providence Journal, from 1884 to 1919, it functioned as \\"the main ship repair facility in Providence.\\" The body of water between Bold Point and India Point, Green Jacket Shoal, is now Rhode Island's largest ship graveyard, largely due to the businesses on Bold Point.

The film released on 22 February 2019 to positive reviews and became a super hit.  Plot  The film begins with newly elected Lalgudi Karupaiah Gandhi (LKG) swearing in as Chief Minister (CM) of Tamil Nadu, where he is shot in the chest by a sniper. The story moves back to six months ago where LKG is a mere councillor from Lalgudi ward in Trichy rural and belongs to the ruling party. LKG aspires to quickly achieve big in politics, unlike his father Azhagu Meiyappan, who neither created fame as a politician nor made money. The incumbent CM and ruling party chief, Avudaiyappan Mudhaliar, falls ill and gets hospitalised, while Bojappan, the party general secretary, becomes the interim CM. Since Avudayappan is the MLA from Lalgudi, LKG decides to put all efforts to contest in the by-election on behalf of the ruling party, once Avudaiyappan dies. However, LKG feels that he needs to create some media visibility to get into Bojappan's good books. LKG gets the paid help of Sarala Munusamy aka Sara M. Samy, an employee of V Analytica ‚Äì a multinational company which is involved in election strategy formulation. LKG goes to Delhi to protest and create an awareness against diseases, which gets the media's attention. Finally, LKG gets Bojappan's attention and meets him at party HQ in Daryaganj. Within a week, Avudaiyppan dies, Bojappan becomes the official Chief Minister, and a by-election is scheduled in Lalgudi constituency. Bojapan urgently announces that LKG is the by-election candidate at the party's general body meeting. Most of the party members and ministers do not agree with Bojappan's decision. The ruling party's deputy-General secretary Ramraj Pandian, who was in USA when Avudayappan died, comes to the meeting hall. He gets furious and feels cheated by Bojappan's actions. He says that Lalgudi, being his hometown, and he had been elected as MLA from Lalgudi for a hat trick in last 17 years, and only relinquished the seat due to Avudayappan's personal request in the previous general election. He announces that he will contest in the election as an independent candidate, and once he wins, Bojappan will be expelled from the party and government, while he becomes the new CM. Now, LKG realises the hardships of contesting in elections. He understands that people are in favour of Ramraj due to his strong influence, hard work, caste and image. Also most of the state minister, ruling party bigwigs, and MLAs do not work for LKG as they want to remain neutral to join the victor of the by-election. LKG devises a strategy to tarnish Ramraj's public image with the help of meme creators and his sidekicks. He spreads rumours that Ramraj is actually a woman disguised as man, which results in the public trolling Ramraj in social media. Ramraj is also insulted when he is unable to sing \\"Tamil Thai Valthu\\" during a college function. Ramraj discovers that V Analytica is behind LKG and strikes a deal with Sara to support him, for which she agrees. As per Sara's advice, Ramraj goes to Delhi and meets national ruling party leaders. He also tries to break the ruling party of Tamil Nadu and prevent Bojappan from trying to take all the party MLAs to a resort. Now it is revealed that Sara was actually pretending to be on Ramraj's side. She comes back to help LKG, but a tussle comes within the party, while some party senior leaders do not want LKG to gain fame. However, Bojappan is in favour of LKG. During election, LKG wins against Ramraj, but Bojappan gets arrested in a few corruption cases, and LKG becomes the CM-elect of the state, due to Bojappan's efforts. Bojappan gets arrested, and the next morning, LKG reaches swearing podium, where he is shot. The flashback ends, and now it is revealed that LKG was wearing a bulletproof vest during the swearing in ceremony upon anticipating such incidents. The sniper is a youngster who aspires to some new-gen honest politicians. LKG speaks in front of the media that he is in to bring a change and that he has transferred the corruption cases against Bojappan to the CBI. He also delivers a message that there are numerous educated youngsters contesting in elections independently with a hope of bringing a change but goes unnoticed by the public due to big political parties staying in the limelight. The sniper is convinced now, and the entire state people believes that LKG will bring some good to the state, unlike other politicians. In the end, Sara gives a smile upon seeing LKG, which implies that he is just becoming a true corrupt politician through his speech trying to woo public which was her strategy as well to win the hearts of people. Also, LKG silently reveals that he never intends to bring Bojappan out of prison.

The CaSTL Center was established through a cooperative agreement between NSF and University of California, Irvine in 2008. Vartkess Ara Apkarian, a Professor of Chemistry at the University of California Irvine, is the Director of the Center. Membership of the Center include noted researchers in nanoscience such as Richard Van Duyne, Hrvoje Petek, Wilson Ho, H. Kumar Wickramasinghe, George Schatz, Eric Potma, Lasse Jensen, Matt Law, Nien-Hui Ge, Jennifer Shumaker-Parry, Ruqian Wu.  Mission  The mission of the CaSTL Center is \\"develop the essential science and technology to probe single chemical events in real space and time\\". CaSTL researchers proposed and developed a new tool, called Chemiscope, a chemist's microscope, to accomplish this goal.  Accomplishments  = Microscopy with a Single Molecule Scanning Electrometer = CaSTL researchers developed experimental & theoretical tools to image electrostatic fields and charge distributions with sub-nanometer spatial resolution. They demonstrated the first Single Molecule limit in miniaturization of microElectroMechanical Systems (SMEMS). They demonstrated that vibrations of a single tip-attached carbon monoxide molecule (CO) serves as a force sensor and electric-to- mechanical force transducer with signal optically relayed through tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS). This discovery enabled researchers to access electric fields, capacitance and conductivity within molecules, which will impact fields ranging from molecular electronics to catalytic chemistry. = Imaging Vibrational Normal Modes of Single Molecules = Internal vibrations of molecules determine the structural transformations that determine chemistry such as reactivity. A CaSTL team led by Vartkess Ara Apkarian reported measured the vibrational normal modes of a single cobalt-tetraphenylporphyrin molecule on a copper surface with atomically confined light. This study used a variant of Tip-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy to measure vibrational spectra within a single molecule. While chemist's use a variety of tools, including Infrared spectroscopy, to measure vibrations of molecules, however, measuring the normal modes of a single molecule has been elusive because microscopy with atomistic resolution requires a magnification nearly three orders of magnitude higher than the optical diffraction limit.  Broader Impacts  CaSTL Center organized several scientific events such as symposia, workshops, summer schools on single molecule chemistry. Noted among these are 2018 Telluride Workshop on Molecular Videography and a symposium themed Toward Chemistry in Real Space and Time at the 2019 Fall Meeting of the American Chemical Society. = Informal Science Education = A science video game titled Bond Breaker was developed by CaSTL scientists in collaboration with TestTubeGames. This game become very popular and featured on the front page of Scientific American. This game is currently available on several gaming platforms across the world. A Classroom version of the game, Bond Breaker - Classroom Edition, based on Next-Generation Science Standards, was released in 2019. This video game consists of a series of game levels, animations, quizzes and NGSS Lesson plans. The characters in this game were chosen to promote diversity and equity in STEM disciplines. = Science Animations = CaSTL scientists helped the development of a series of science animations, such as What is an Atom and How Do We Know?, What are Atoms Made of?, What is a Molecule?, and How to See a Virus, explaining the basic concepts of nanoscience to the broader public. = CaSTL - ASU Pathways Program = CaSTL scientists partnered with the Albany State University to provide Summer Research Experience to the underrepresented undergraduate students with the support from University of California, Office of the President. This program later attracted participation from other HBCU institutions such as Hampton University, Tuskegee University.

It was produced by Conspira√ß√£o Filmes, co-produced by Globo Filmes and by Lereby Produ√ß√µes and distributed in Brazil and Worldwide by Columbia Pictures.  Plot  D√© (Thiago Martins) was born and raised at the Cantagalo slum, in Rio de Janeiro. As a child, he witnessed his brother being murdered by a local drug dealer due to a football-related fight. His other brother, Carl√£o (Rocco Pitanga), is banished from the slum and ends up arrested because of him. Willing to live an honest life, D√© gets a job at a kiosk at Ipanema beach. There, he meets Nina (Vit√≥ria Frate), a rich girl living in an apartment right in front of the kiosk. The two fall in love and begin to date. Initially, they keep their relationship as a secret because of her overprotective father Evandro (Paulo C√©sar Grande), but after he finds out, he ends up accepting it after much insistence by Nina. Carl√£o manages to get out thanks to a deal he settled with the police and returns to Cantagalo to take it over and kill his brother's murderer. The dispute between crime gangs turns Cantagalo into a very dangerous place and Evandro forbids Nina from visiting D√© at the slum. Furthermore, he buys two tickets to Europe, willing to move out of Brazil with Nina. She pretends she accepted his offer, but secretly she plans to escape to Northeast Brazil with D√©. Carl√£o throws a farewell party to the couple at Cantagalo. However, at that same night, cops and criminals come collect the money he owes them. Desperate, Carl√£o has Nina kidnapped in hopes of demanding a high ransom from Evandro. Evandro, however, has his contacts in the media publish pictures of D√© all over the news, believing him to be the kidnapper. D√© goes seek help from Carl√£o, still unaware that he is behind the kidnapping. When the truth comes out, the two fight and D√© shoots Carl√£o in the chest. The drug lord regrets his actions and tells the couple to flee from Cantagalo. Fearing most won't believe D√© is innocent, they go straight to the kiosk to collect some money and buy tickets to Northeast. However, when they arrive at Ipanema, dozens of cops and reporters are waiting in front of her building and they rush to the kiosk for shelter. Nina suggests that D√© pretends to be peacefully releasing her and surrendering. The plan goes wrong when the police execute him in spite of him posing no threat. An infuriated Nina reacts by grabbing his gun and shooting randomly at the crowd, causing the cops to execute her, as well.

Critical reception  According to Reuters, the film \\"navigates between narrative and visual clich√©s -- such as excessive use of music and slow motion. What genuinely emerges is the talent of Thiago Martins, who manages to express veracity and emotion through his character.\\" Ronaldo Pelli, from G1, also criticized the movie for being clich√© and considered it a prejudice that only Martins was allowed to talk about Cantagalo during a mid-credits commentary. He concluded by saying the movie is predictable and that \\"nothing happens\\" from the middle to the end. On the other hand, he praised the photography, the choice of Cantagalo as the filming location and the \\"good and correct acting\\" of Rocco Pitanga, Martins and Vit√≥ria Frate.

The wing configuration was inverted biplane-sesquiplane, with the upper wing opening lower than the one mounted low on the fuselage. The two wings were connected to each other by an N- shaped mullion on each side integrated with steel wire tie -rods, with the upper connected to the fuselage by a central tubular castle. The landing gear was a simple two- wheeled cycle with shock- absorbed power legs fitted with a \\"trouser\\" fairing, integrated at the back by a small wheel. The propulsion was entrusted to an Isotta Fraschini Asso XI RC.40 engine positioned at the front apex of the fuselage, a liquid-cooled 12-cylinder V engine capable of delivering a power output of 900 hp (662 kW ), covered by a metal casing and combined with a triple helix. The armament consisted of a pair of Breda-SAFAT machine guns of different caliber, the heaviest 12.7 mm mounted on the hunt and the lighter 7.7 mm mounted on a tilting support and positioned in the rear passenger compartment. Development In 1936 the Ministry of Aeronautics issued a specification for the supply of a new terrestrial strategic reconnaissance aircraft. The Caproni also participated in the competition announcement with a design assigned to the designation Ca.134. The Ca.134 was evaluated in Guidonia on January 23, 1937 by the commission examining the Regia Aeronautica but did not get any commission.

It first appeared in a concept car in 1952, and was later used in Volvo's truck line from 1956 to 1966. History In 1952 Volvo unveiled a concept car called the Volvo Philip. This American-style sedan was powered by a newly designed prototype V8 engine called the B8B. The Philip did not go into production, but its V8 engine, redesigned and renamed the B36, did a few years later, when it appeared in the Volvo Snabbe and Trygge trucks. The V8 was produced by Volvo in their facilities in Gothenburg and Sk√∂vde. The engine's full name was B36AV. In March 1958, shortly after the end of production of the large PV830 model, Volvo started work on internal Project 358. The project's goal was to develop a replacement for that earlier, inline-six powered car using the V8 engine from the Philip showcar. This project failed to reach production. Volvo revisited the idea of a V8-powered passenger car again later with the Volvo Amazon. For the first exercise, called \\"Project Victor\\", five copies of a revised B36 called the C8B were built. These engines had a displacement of just 2.5 litres, but to fit them into the Amazon engine bay the sheet metal had to be modified. When the project was cancelled the engines were essentially abandoned in the factory at Sk√∂vde. Another project, called Amazon Brede (Wide Amazon), installed a C8B in an Amazon made by welding together two separate cars, widening the whole structure by . The Amazon Brede project remained a one-off. Versions of the B36 were used in products from Volvo's Penta marine propulsion division. The MB36A was available from 1956 to 1965 and produced , and the MB36B version was sold from 1964 to 1965 and produced . The B36 was also used in the Penta AQ180. Technical features The B36 is a 4-stroke V8 with a 90¬∞ angle between the cylinder banks. The engine block and cylinder heads are made of cast iron. The cylinder firing order is: 1-8-4-3-6-5-7-2. Cylinder bore diameter is and the piston stroke is , for a total displacement of . The original compression ratio is 7.6:1. Power and torque output are at 4000 rpm and at 2200 rpm respectively. The engine weighs . The intake manifold and a two barrel Carter carburetor are centrally located between the cylinder banks. Because the B36 had exactly the same bore and stroke dimensions as the later B18 and the two engines also have some valve-train parts in common, some suggest that the B18 is one-half of the B36 V8. Significant differences between the B36 and the B18 include different crank lengths and piston heights. Also, while the B36 cylinder heads are of the crossflow type, the B18 has both intake and exhaust ports on the same side. Due to these differences others assert that the engines are for the most part separate designs.

Since 2016 she has co-owned and operated the recording and production studio Wildlife Sanctuary Sound in Grey County, Ontario. Early life and education Conway grew up in northern British Columbia where she started playing music as a child. She began playing the violin at the age of four and learned to play the guitar before developing an interest in songwriting. Her father worked as an elementary school music teacher and at the age of 13 she used his recording equipment to record and produced an album for her high school band. Influenced by Canadian composer Oliver Schroer while attending camp as a teenager, she later moved to Ontario to attend York University in Toronto, where Schroer had studied. Conway holds a BFA of in music from York University and an MA in Sonic Arts from Queen's University Belfast, Northern Ireland. She completed a residency with the Canadian Film Center in 2016. Two years later she was selected to participate in the Red Bull Music Academy in Berlin, Germany. Career Conway has released music as The Owle Bird, the Twin Peaks-inspired project Chrome and the Ice Queen and, since 2012, as L CON. She began singing with Toronto-based Del Bel in 2011, in addition to taking on songwriting duties alongside bandleader Tyler Belluz. Toronto Star reviewer Ben Rayner called the band's release Oneiric \\"one of the most accomplished albums, Canadian or otherwise, released in 2011.\\" She stepped away from Del Bel in 2017 to focus on her solo work shortly after the release of the band's third album, III. In addition to writing and production work, Conway frequently collaborates with other artists and incorporates multi-media elements to her performances and releases. The 2016 video for her song \\"The Form of Space\\", directed by Victoria Long, featured an amateur dance troupe based in Guelph, Ontario. She worked with Long on a second video in 2018 following the release for the L CON album Insecurities in Being. Conway co-owns and operates Wildlife Sanctuary Sound, a recording and production studio in Grey County, just north of Durham, Ontario, with her partner, musician and producer Andrew Collins. The couple met as music students at York University. Situated on 2.5 acres of land, the space is surrounded by forest and formerly served as a yoga studio. The first album recorded and produced in the studio was Conway's 2016 L CON release Moon Milk. Playing, performing and producing music since her teens, Conway has been vocal about her experiences as a woman in the music industry. In a 2016 interview with The Silhouette she explained that: \\"As a woman in the music industry a lot of people make assumptions about you and I found especially as a vocalist I get pegged as somebody who just sings; who doesn‚Äôt know anything about recording or production.\\" The sentiment was echoed in a 2018 interview with Canadian music blog Grayowl Point, where she explained that her production work had been glossed over for the majority of her career. =L CON= Conway performs as L CON both alone and with a band that includes Andrew Collins, Jordan Howard and Karen Ng. She began releasing music under the moniker in 2012 with the six-song EP The Ballad Project, which she wrote, arranged, orchestrated and co-produced the contributions of 20 musicians. It was followed a year later by The Ballads Reimagined, an electronic reinterpretation of the album with two new songs. Released by Daps Records, the EP was recorded by Conway while living in Toronto and mixed by Ohbijou bass player Heather Kirby. L CON's 2016 release Moon Milk was based on Italo Calvino's 1965 science fiction short-story collection Cosmicomics. Each of the album's songs is inspired by and named after one of the stories in the collection. They were written during a three week residency in Sackville, New Brunswick, during the summer of 2013. Conway's third album as L CON, Insecurities in Being, was released on May 25, 2018. Writing for Now, reviewer Mark Streeter noted the refinement Conway brought to her work, explaining that the release was \\"recorded like a rock record but treated and mixed with pop sensibilities [...] full of intricate arrangements and careful playing\\".

She was the second woman in Peru to become a licensed pilot and received a trophy from President Manuel Prado Ugarteche. Carlstrom took part in air races over the mountains of Peru, flying over the Andes at altitudes of 18,000 feet. During World War II, Carlstrom joined the Women Airforce Service Pilots, where she ferried \\"mainly pursuit aircraft\\". She served in the WASP for twenty-two months and was one of the few WASP pilots to fly a Lockheed P-38 Lightning airplane. She was stationed at Love Field in Texas. There, she met and married Carl Trick, a U.S. Army Major. After the war, Carlstrom and her husband moved to her father's ranch in the North Park basin of Colorado, later named the North Park Angus Ranch. They were credited with introducing Angus cattle to the basin and being the first ranchers in the basin to artificially inseminate their cattle. Carlstrom flew occasionally in a friend's plane, but explained, \\"We were used to flying such great airplanes, and there was no way we could afford to fly planes like that.\\" She looked back fondly on her piloting career: > \\"I think every child, no matter how much they love this country, love the > ranching, should go out and know that it's a big world. Get their self- > confidence, know what they can do. Then they can come back because they want > to come back, not because it seemed the easiest thing to do, or because they > were hesitant or afraid to try something else. This makes people strong.\\" In 1961, she was on an episode of Say When!! (game show), where she beat Mr. Mortensen, a tugboat deckhand. Carlstrom had two children, Carl and Christine. She died on January 14, 2010.

Mayu Matsuoka, who plays the lead role, was nominated for Outstanding Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role in the 42nd Japan Academy Film Prize. Plot Yoshika Et≈ç (Mayu Matsuoka) is a 24-year-old account who has never had a boyfriend before. She still dreams of being with her middle school crush, whom she calls Ichi (meaning \\"number one\\"), although they have not talked in years. At work, a man she calls Ni (meaning \\"number two\\") starts showing a romantic interest in her. She begins spending time with him outside of work, even as she still daydreams of being with Ichi. When she is alone at her apartment, she spends her free time researching extinct animals on Wikipedia, especially ammonite fossils, going so far as to order a fossil through the mail. Before committing to Ni, she decides that she needs to try to reunite with Ichi. She devises a way to meet him by pretending to be another classmate on social media and inviting their middle school class to a class reunion. Ichi shows up to the reunion and Yoshika learns that he has relocated to Tokyo. The group of classmates who live in Tokyo agree to meet again at one of their apartments for another get together. Yoshika attends the second reunion, where she fantasizes of Ichi remembering her and the drawings of him as a prince that she used to make when she was younger, but realizes that he does not seem to recognize her. She continues spending time with Ni and eventually develops true feelings for him. They have a date at a zoo and agree to go steady. However, Yoshika soon becomes embarrassed when she finds out that her co-worker and friend Kurumi (Anna Ishibashi) told Ni that she is a virgin who has never been kissed before. She tells him that she wants to pursue Ichi so that they can break up and gets maternity leave from work so that she can avoid her coworker and Ni.

The town is located on the northeastern slope of the Gavilan Peak, between the towns of Anthem and Black Canyon City on Interstate 17 in Arizona. Brief history New River is named after the seasonal wash of the same name, part of the Agua Fria River system which drains into the Salt River. The New River Mountains are part of a region extending southwards from the southeast of the Black Hills of central Arizona. The region contains mesas, hills, and mountain peaks; the region is bordered on the west by the Black Canyon, where the Agua Fria River flows south towards Phoenix, and on the east, canyons where the Verde River also flows south to enter the Phoenix valley. \\"New River\\"; By: Marcy J. Miller; Pages 7-8; Publisher: Arcadia Publishing; =Early settlers= The first known settlers of the area were the Hohokam, a pre-historic Native American tribe. They were the first to establish communities in the area, however for unknown reasons the site was abandoned by 1450 AD.. Later the Tonto Apaches and the Yavapai settled in the region. The Tonto Apache lived alongside the Wipukepa (\\"People from the Foot of the Red Rock\\") and Kewevkapaya, two of the four subgroups of the Yavapai of central and western Arizona. Both tribes were hunter-gatherers, they hunted (antelope, deer, birds, bush rats, etc.) and collected (agave, berries, wild plants, seeds).THE APACHES AND YAVAPAI, CRUCIAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THEM In 1868, Lord Darrell Duppa, an Englishman who was a pioneer in the settlement of Arizona, founded a stagecoach stop on the northeastern slope of the Gavilan Peak which would eventually become the unincorporated town of New River. The peak is within New River Mountains which are part of a region extending southwards from the southeast of the Black Hills of central Arizona.Apache Peak - New River Mountains Soon settlers from the east coast of the United States began to arrive and establish farms and ranches such as the T Ranch, the Y Ranch, and the Spear S Ranch. This was partially due to the passage of the 1864 Homestead ActPrimary Documents in American History which provided availability of public lands to the newcomers. For many years the stagecoach stops were the terminus of the old Black Canyon Highway (now Interstate 17). The pavement ended in New River and continued as a dirt road to the city of Prescott. =The Miller family massacre= The Miller family were among the first settlers. They owned the \\"Station\\", the first stage stop established in the area. They also owned a ranch at the base of Gavilan Peak. All seven members of the family were massacred in an Apache raid, precipitating U.S. Cavalry campaigns against the Apaches. The US Cavalry thus became involved in a campaign in the area to protect the settlers from further attacks. They drove out the Apaches and extended the Stoneman Military Trail which was to connect Fort McDowell in Phoenix with Fort Whipple in Prescott. The campaign ended in 1886 and the military established a base on Gavilan Peak. In 1890, the New River Stagecoach Stop was established and later became known as the Wranglers Roost Stagecoach Stop.

Early life Crum was born in Mishawaka, Indiana, and after he graduated high school, attended Western Michigan Teachers College (now Western Michigan University). Initially a German major, World War II interrupted his education. He joined the United States Army Air Force in 1942 and served in the Intelligence Division. He was stationed in North Africa and the Middle East working as a cryptographer.Buck, W., & Anderson, L. (2003). Howard Crum (1922-2002). The Bryologist, 106(1), 9-23. Retrieved from https://www.jstor.org/stable/3244795 After the war, Crum returned to Western Michigan and changed his major from German to botany. He received his B.S. in 1947. The fall after receiving his undergraduate degree, he began his graduate work at the University of Michigan. He completed his Ph.D. in 1951 under direction of Harley H. Bartlett. Upon finishing his degree, he went to Stanford University for a 2-year postdoc, working with William C. Steere to study moss specimens from Canada, Alaska, and Puerto Rico. Career In 1953, Crum left California and accepted a position in the Department of Biology at the University of Kentucky at Louisville. After one year, he left to take up the Curator of Cryptogams position at the National Museum of Canada in Ottawa. Crum worked there for 11 years, and was instrumental in building up their bryological collection. In 1965, he accepted a position as Associate Professor of Botany at the University of Michigan. He began to work closely with Lewis E. Anderson on a compendium of the mosses of eastern North America. Their research was published in 1981, and recognized about 750 species. Crum began to teach summer bryology classes at the University of Michigan Biological Station. Realizing that no adequate textbook was available, Crum wrote his own, entitled Mosses of the Great Lakes Forest. Crum soon turned his attention to the genus Sphagnum. He went on to publish over 100 taxa new to science. Around this time, he and Aaron John Sharp produced the Moss Flora of Mexico. Crum gained much knowledge into the Mexican moss flora through his doctoral dissertation, which he used to help create this modern moss treatment for a tropical region, the first of its kind. In the meantime, he continued to publish his Sphagnum research. He soon gained interest in the liverworts and hornworts, and continued his studies until his death from stomach cancer at age 79. Legacy Crum is the namesake of three genera: Bryocrumia, Crumia, and Crumuscus; and eight species: Bellia crumii, Encalypta brevicollis subsp. crumiana, Fissidens crumii, Macromitrium crumianum, Ochrobryum crumii, Racomitrium crumianum, Schlotheimia crumii, and Sphagnum crumii.

It is discussed as a promising technology for greenhouse gas removal.Constanze Werner et al. (2018): Biogeochemical potential of biomass pyrolysis systems for limiting global warming to 1.5¬∞ C. Environmental Research Letters, 13(4), 044036.  Principle  The principle of PyCCS is that the biomass (e.g. trees) removes CO2 from the atmosphere during its growth via photosynthesis. This biomass is then harvested and pyrolyzed (see below), with a portion of the carbon dioxide bound in the biomass being captured in the ground, after being reduced to carbon and viscous compounds (charcoal). The flammable gas mixture, which is the lightest fraction in pyrolysis, is collected and used as fuel; the carbon dioxide produced when combusting it is captured traditionally.  Technology  Pyrolysis in the context of carbon capture and storage has been described by Werner et al. (2018) as \\"the thermal treatment of biomass at 350 ¬∞C‚Äì900 ¬∞C in an oxygen- deficient atmosphere. Three main carbonaceous products are generated during this process, which can be stored subsequently in different ways to produce [negative emissions]: a solid biochar as soil amendment, a pyrolytic liquid (bio-oil) pumped into depleted fossil oil repositories, and permanent-pyrogas (dominated by the combustible gases CO, H2 and CH4) that may be transferred as CO2 to geological storages after combustion.\\" In low-oxygen conditions, the thermal-chemical conversion of organic materials (including biomass) produces both volatiles, termed pyrolytic gases (pyrogases), as well as solid carbonaceous co-products, termed biochar. While the pyrogases mostly condense into liquid bio-oil, which may be used as an energy source, biochar has been proposed as a tool for sequestering carbon in soil. Once mixed into soil, biochar, which is less susceptible to remineralization into CO2 and CH4 than non-pyrogenic biomass, fragments into micro- and nano-particles which can be transported to deeper soil horizons, groundwater, or other compartments that further protect it from degradation. Multiple studies have demonstrated that pyrogenic carbon is stable over centennial timescales.

It is situated in The Brothers Wilderness on land managed by Olympic National Forest. Mount Jupiter is easy to identify from Seattle, since it appears as the prominent peak between The Brothers and Mount Constance. The Jupiter name was applied by the Seattle Press Expedition in an effort to link the peak with the Greco-Roman mythological names associated with Mount Olympus.Olympic Mountains: A Climbing Guide, Olympic Mountain Rescue, Fourth Edition, 2006, The Mountaineers Books, page 103 Jupiter was a Roman god on Olympus. Climate Mt Jupiter from Highway 101 Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Mount Jupiter is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Olympic Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Olympic Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall (Orographic lift). As a result, the Olympics experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in avalanche danger. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. In terms of favorable weather, June to October are the best months for hiking up the mountain.Mount Jupiter on Climbersguideolympics.com Precipitation runoff from the north side of the mountain drains into the Dosewallips River, whereas the south side drains into the Duckabush River.

He is best known for the \\"Life of the Serbian Patriarch Ephraim\\" and other biographies. Biography Bishop Mark of Peƒá (hence Marko Peƒáki) belongs to a prominent place in the hesychast monastic hagiography from the time of Prince Lazar of Serbia and the Battle of Kosovo in 1389. He left his autobiographical data in his Letter to commemorate Gerasim and Euphemia (Jefimija). Marko was born in 1360 in a village near Peƒá in Serbian Kosovo, as the youngest of four sons, born into a priestly family. We do not know his baptismal name, however, we know that all four brothers were priests. His father's secular name was probably George because he chose Gerasim as his new name for his new monastic way of life,and as Hieromonk Gerasim, he went on to build the church of St. George, where Marko's mother lived in the same cloister with Euphemia. Dedicated to church service, Marko received a monastic designation from Serbian Patriarch Jefrem (patriarch) in 1777 when he was only seventeen, the exact age for acceptance into monastic life. Under patriarch's spiritual guidance, Marko spent twenty-three years as a monk, educated in the Serbian Patriarchate of Peƒá. He was appointed Hieromonk during Jefrem second tenure in the Patriarchate of Peƒá in autumn of 1389 or in the spring of 1390. That year Marko was elected bishop of Peƒá at the same Holy Assembly of Bishops when Danilo III Banjski (Danilo III (patriarch) was consecrated patriarch after Jefrem renounced the patriarchal see in 1390 and retired (he died in 1400).

She has taught music and performing arts at the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels.  Biography  Marcia Louise Howard, was born in 1961 and raised in the rural town of Dennington ( north west of Warrnambool) by Leo Francis Howard (April 1916‚ÄìFebruary 2010) and Honora \\"Teresa\\" nee Madden (c. 1924‚Äì2014), with five brothers, Eric, Stephen, Shane Shane Brendan and Damian, and her sister, Adele. Leo worked at the Nestle's factory, which manufactured coffee and powdered milk; Teresa was a radio announcer, secretary, actress, pianist and singer. Howard later recalled, \\"We were known as 'The Von Trapp Family of the Western District', because we played and sang at everyone's weddings, parties, kitchen teas, celebrations. Mum on piano and all of us singing, you know, Mary Poppins songs, Sound of Music.\\" She was educated at St John's Dennington Primary School, St Anne's (later incorporated into Emmanuel College), Warrnambool; she relocated first to Melbourne to Australian Catholic University, to complete a Diploma of Education (Music) in 1981. Howard, on backing vocals and keyboards, joined her older brother, Shane's folk-rock band, Goanna, in Melbourne in 1980. Goanna broke up in 1986 and Howard continued with her brother's projects, Shane Howard and Friends (1986) and then Shane Howard Band (1987‚Äì88, 1991). She worked on Shane's early solo albums and toured in his backing bands. Howard was a session musician on Joe Geia's (ex-Shane Howard and Friends, Shane Howard Band) debut album, Yil Lull (1988), which includes the title track. She later worked on Kavisha Mazzella's album, Fisherman's Daughter (1998) and Dave Steel's The Edge of the World (May 1999) before working on former Goanna band-mate, Rose Bygrave's debut solo album, White Bird (mid-1999).. Marcia traveled to Asia and Europe and sang and worked overseas for a year in 1990. When she returned in 1991 she took up her first music teaching position at John Pujajankgka Pirin school in Mulan, Western Australia in the Great Sandy Desert. She married in 1992 and moved to Port Fairy. She worked with her brother Damian Howard in the 1990s, performing live and recording with him on his solo albums while raising her two children and running a Bed and Breakfast, Hanley House with her (now ex-husband) James Gubbins in Port Fairy. Howard's debut solo album, Butterfly, was issued in 2000. For the recording she played Maton guitars, keyboards and provided lead vocals. In the studio she was joined by Patricia Clarke and Shane Howard on backing vocals and Archie Cuthbertson on drums and percussion for the first recording of the Gunditjmara lullaby, Vulla Vunnah Nah. She followed with her second album, Burning in the Rain, in March 2004. It was recorded over two years, during four trips to her family's ancestral home of Ireland. Produced by Steve Cooney the album featured Tim O'Brien, Mary Black, Maria Doyle Kennedy, Kevin Bourke and Laiose Kelly. Marcia had opened for Mary Black at the Olympia Theatre in Dublin for over five nights in 2002. While in that country she had recorded, \\"Poison Tree\\", as a duet with Irish folk singer, Mary Black. Howard wrote it based on a poem, \\"A Poison Tree, by William Blake; it appears on a various artists compilation album, A Woman's Heart ‚Äì A Decade On (2002). Mary Black Orchestrated (2020). In 2008 Marcia toured with her brother Damian Howard and his band the Ploughboys performing their co-written show, From Ireland to Island at theatres and venues in Denmark, Ireland, and the UK. In 2009, Marcia was invited to complete her Master of Education Thesis at Monash University Gippsland as a part of the Koori Cohort. She completed her thesis, Holy Wells to Waterholes: belonging through song in 2014. During her study as a member of the cohort, she performed with Candian Indian elders, Kutcha Edwards, Robbie Bundle, Monica Weightman and Dr. Herb Patten at the WICPE Conference at Rod Laver Arena in 2009 and recorded the album Gulpa Ngawal, engineered by Anthony Norris at RMIT studios in Melbourne, produced by Dr. Laura Brearley, Monash University and RMIT. Howard's third album, Pearl (2011), is a collaboration with Bygrave, which began in late 2009: each wrote five tracks. By that time Howard had moved from Barwon Heads to Warrnambool, to look after her elderly parents. Dave Dawson of Nu Country reviewed the album and observed, \\"[they] recorded [it] at home studios in Queenscliff and Warrnambool with [Jon] Emry's drums added by Lost in Suburbia bassist Peter Bird at his Yelp studio in Howard's hometown. Bassist Isaac Barter and previous producer Steve Cooney plays guitar on the disc...

Pure vocals, perfect enunciation, and impeccable harmonies ensure these homespun homilies and modern messages are massaged as they meet on high at the pass.\\" During 2015 she travelled to Nashville and recorded four tracks for an extended play, Nashville Sessions (June 2016). She was a contestant for Season 5 of The Voice (Australia) from May to June 2016. According to Howard, \\"My nephew William encouraged me to go on the show when I came back from a year overseas in 2015 after recording my EP in Nashville. I was hesitant at first but it turned out to be a worthwhile musical experience. A fabulous band, musical and production team to work with. It was an interesting experience for me as a musician and songwriter being able to just focus on my singing and singing other peoples' songs in an interesting way was a professional challenge for me. It was lovely to meet the other singers on the show and sing with them backstage.\\" In October 2017 she released her next album, Everything Reminds Me, and was joined in the studio by Issac Barter, Lee Morgan on guitar, Justin Olsson on drums, Matiss Schubert on mandolin and fiddle, and Richard Tankard on keyboards. When not touring or recording, Howard is an academic and works as a music and performing arts teacher/lecturer; she has taught in primary, secondary and tertiary institutions. In 2018 Marcia wrote the show, House of Song with Sherri McIver and Ian Roberts and toured Australia performing the theatre show at festivals and theatres with her musicians, Liam Gubbins (her son) and Matiss Schubert. Marcia is currently completing her Ph.D. in Creative Arts and Communication at Deakin University about her life as a musician in the Australian music industry over the past four decades. Her new album will be released later this year produced by Liam Gubbins (Gubmusic).

The character was introduced as the sister of Phil Archer in 1951, and the daughter of Dan and Doris Archer. The character was a skilled horsewoman, who for many years ran the Ambridge riding stables. British actress Lesley Saweard has played the role since 1953. As of 2020, Saweard has played the role for 67 years, making her the longest- serving soap opera actor in the world. Saweard describes her character as a \\"likable, reliable, capable person, very like her mother Doris\\" but who \\"sadly doesn‚Äôt see much of her son Peter\\". The character lives with Peggy Woolley (June Spencer) at The Lodge. Her character is nicknamed 'Auntie Chris' by many of the characters in the show.  Creation and casting  = Casting = The character of Christine Archer was originally played by actress Pamela Mant when the series when The Archers was first broadcast nationally from January 1, 1951. Christine was a close friend of her brother Phil's future wife, Grace Fairbrother. In late 1953, Saweard, aged 19, was asked to drive Denis Folwell (who played Jack Archer) from Lincoln Station and take him to a fete opening. He told Saweard how \\"similar her voice was to Pamela Mant\\" to which Saweard replied: \\"let me know if she's ill\\". Mant would leave the series abruptly that year, and at Denis's suggestion, Saweard was asked to audition. The Archers official website says she was \\"pronounced a perfect voice match and the change in actress went unnoticed\\".  Development  = The Early Years = Christine's first appearance was during a New Year's Eve party at Brookfield Farm in 1951. The following year Christine would start up the riding stables with her wealthy best-friend and sister-in-law, Grace Archer. Sadness would follow, as she discovered her boyfriend, Dick Raymond, was actually already engaged. This led Christine to almost flee Ambridge and go travelling with the mysterious Lady Hylberrow to Ethiopia. Tragedy would strike when Grace will killed in a stable fire in 1955, trying to rescue Midnight, Christine's horse. In 1956, Christine wed Paul Johnson, much to his family's chagrin. The Johnson's believed they were in \\"social superiority\\" to the Archers. The book, Who's Who in The Archers, described Paul was a \\"flaky\\" husband. But the marriage was not without its hiccups - with Christine accusing her husband of having an affair with Marianne Peters. Paul lost his job in 1962, and forced Christine to leave her stables business for Newmarket, where he would train as a helicopter pilot. He later found life as a crop-dusting helicopter pilot was not as glamorous, or well-paying, as he hoped, and the couple moved back to Ambridge a year later. Christine and Paul never had children, which made Paul become a father-figureto friend Carol's fatherless son Richard. The couple decided to adopt, and welcomed Peter into their home. Christine Barford with her horse, Midnight, in a promotion photo from the 1950s. = Paul Johnson's death and marriage to George Barford = Jennifer Archer moved in with Christine in 1974 while Paul was in Germany trying to set up his horsebox business. Upon his return to the country, Paul moved to London. He would return in 1976 to Ambridge after admitting to having an affair with a colleague and chucking in his job. The next year, he left Christine for good after his fish-farming business failed and he went bankrupt. While Christine worked her way through the separation, gamekeeper and former policeman George Barford (Graham Roberts) and Nora McAuley had split. George and Christine would be thrown together when in 1978, Paul is killed in a car accident in Germany. The pair married once George's divorce was finalised, despite the doubts of the Archer family. This was despite her uncle, Tom Forrest, also being a gamekeeper. An obituary for Roberts in The Telegraph described George and Christine's marriage as \\" enduring and happy, a testament, perhaps, to George Barford's hidden depths\\" despite coming from \\"distinctly different class backgrounds\\". The Bishop of Truro at the time spoke out in the media over the impact of family values, given Christine was marrying George, who was a divorcee. = Firebombing and George's death = During his time as a policeman, George was responsible for pinning a string of burglaries to Susan Carter's brother, Clive Horrobin. Horrobin had also held up the village shop in 1993, and knocked George unconscious in 1997. In 2003, there was a spate of \\"horse slashings\\" at The Stables. Clive was named as the culprit, under the belief George and Christine still lived there. After being imprisoned for four months, Clive returned in 2004 and held the Barford's up at gunpoint in their home. When Phil unexpectedly called, Clive was roused and made off with the gun. Little more than a week later, Clive petrol-bombed their house, The Old Police Station, leaving Christine and Jill Archer trapped inside. George and Christine were left homeless. The episode left Christine shaken, and a year later, George died while waiting to move into their new home. = Later years = The death of George put paid to any plans Christine had to a quiet retirement. She was forced to give up The Stables and riding instructing, selling the business to her niece Shula Hebden-Lloyd. Christine then moved in with her long-time sister-in-law Peggy Woolley at The Lodge. In 2017, conman Matt Crawford was targeting the people of Ambridge, including Lilian Bellamy and Justin Elliott. Christine was revealed to be one of the victims, having invested more than ¬£300,000. Christine sold her house to Fallon to invest in Crawford's Melling Enterprises. In 2018, Christine moved into The Laurel's assisted living facility after tripping over Peggy's cat Hilda and breaking her hip. With Christine skint due to her scamming the year earlier, Peggy paid for her stay at the aged care facility. The accident led to Christine withdrawing from many social gatherings, out of fear of having a similar fall.

Prospect Nature Reserve lies within the Western Sydney Parklands. Prospect Nature Reserve was established on 28 February 2007 and covers 325.3 hectares on the northern & western shore of Prospect Reservoir in Western Sydney. It is located approximately ten kilometres west of Parramatta and five kilometres south of Blacktown. Prospect Nature Reserve contains one of the largest remaining remnants of the critically endangered Cumberland Plain Woodland community, and therefore has a significant role in the conservation of regional biodiversity for western Sydney. The reserve also has cultural value to the Darug people.DEC (Department of Environment and Conservation (NSW)) (2005).

It contains the largest area of Grey Box Woodland within the Blacktown area, which comprises both the Shale Plains Woodland and Shale Hills Woodland elements of the Cumberland Plain. The vegetation condition varies from a young eucalypt canopy with a low diversity understorey to eucalypt regrowth in a largely exotic pasture. Other areas are exotic pastures with no native element present. Other plant species in the area include, Forest Red Gum (E.

Subjugation of Babylon In 521 BCE, Intaphrenes was sent as general at the head of an army by Darius I to eliminate Arakha, who allegedly had usurped the throne of Babylon as Nebuchadnezzar IV in 522 BCE. Babylon was taken without much fighting on November 27, 521 BCE, and as was customary in such cases, Arakha was mutilated and impaled with his followers. Death Darius I, and five other conspirators, including Intaphrenes, invoking the sun to become King. Intaphrenes was put to death after the insurrection for trying to enter the King's palace while he was lying with his wife.Herodotus III, 118 The seven noblemen who had toppled Bardiya had made an agreement that they could all visit the new king whenever they pleased, except when he was with his wife. One evening, Intaphrenes went to the palace to meet Darius, but was stopped by two officers who stated that Darius had retired for the night. Becoming enraged and insulted, Intaphrenes drew his sword and cut off the ears and noses of the two officers. While leaving the palace, he took the bridle from his horse, and tied the two officers together. The officers went to the king and showed him what Intaphrenes had done to them. Darius began to fear for his own safety; he thought that all seven noblemen had banded together to rebel against him and that the attack against his officers was the first sign of revolt. He sent a messenger to each of the noblemen, asking them if they approved of Intaphrenes's actions. They denied and disavowed any connection with Intaphrenes's actions, stating that they stood by their decision to appoint Darius as King of Kings. Taking precautions against further resistance, Darius sent soldiers to seize Intaphrenes, along with his son, family members, relatives and any friends who were capable of arming themselves. Darius believed that Intaphrenes was planning a rebellion, but when he was brought to the court, there was no proof of any such plan. Nonetheless, Darius killed Intaphrenes's entire family, excluding his wife's brother and son. She was asked to choose between her brother and son. She chose her brother to live. Her reasoning for doing so was that she could have another husband and another son, but she would always have but one brother. Darius was impressed by her response and spared both her brother's and her son's life. The name Intaphrenes was never mentioned again by Herodotus after Intaphrenes's death.

Basal Eurasians may have been present in the Near East, as anatomically modern humans resided in the Levant approximately 100,000 years ago and African-related tools in Arabia were likely developed by modern humans; hence, they may have settled in the Levant or Arabia. The areas of the Near East where Basal Eurasians resided may have been areas where contact with Neanderthals, who were known to have lived in West Eurasia, were not made. Basal Eurasians are the sibling group that diverged from the main lineage of all other non-African groups (e.g., Australian Aborigines, New Guineans, Europeans, East Asians), prior to their divergence from one another. The admixture of the main lineage of all other non-Africans with Neanderthals likely occurred 50,000-60,000 years ago, after it diverged from Basal Eurasians. The scenario of a non-Neanderthal-admixed modern human population, which is basal to other Eurasians, and resided in Africa, is plausible. In particular, North Africa is a strong candidate as a location for the emergence of Basal Eurasians as it shares notable connection with Eurasia. Natufians, who share craniometric affinity with North Africans and were of the Y-chromosomal haplogroup E, are of Basal Eurasian ancestry. Basal Eurasians had little to possibly no Neanderthal admixture. However, Natufians do not share a greater amount of alleles with Sub-Saharan Africans than other ancient Eurasians, and the Basal Eurasian ancestry in Natufians is consistent with originating from the same population as Neolithic Iranians and Mesolithic Iranians. Mesolithic Iranians (66¬±13%), Neolithic Iranians (48¬±6%), and Epipaleolithic Natufians (44¬±8% or 63%) share Basal Eurasian ancestry. Another estimate given for Holocene-era Near Easterners (e.g., Mesolithic Caucasian Hunter Gatherers, Mesolithic Iranians, Neolithic Iranians, Natufians) is that they possess up to 50% Basal Eurasian ancestry. Additionally, while the Taforalt individuals were considered likely direct descendants of Basal Eurasians, they were shown to not be genetically closer to Basal Eurasians than Holocene-era Iranians. High levels of Basal Eurasian ancestry were found in ancient Middle Eastern genomes, which negatively correlated with Neanderthal ancestry. Basal Eurasians may have less Neanderthal ancestry than other ancestral Eurasian lineages, and the extent to which Basal Eurasian ancestry is present may explain the extent to which Neanderthal ancestry is present in Middle Eastern genomes. For example, a high level of Basal Eurasian or Sub-Saharan African ancestry could be the underlying reason for the low level of Neanderthal ancestry in Qatari Bedouin in comparison to Europeans or other Middle Eastern populations. The most parsimonious explanations for similar or less Neanderthal introgression in Middle Eastern populations, compared to other Eurasian populations, are the presence of Sub-Saharan African ancestry as well as the presence of Basal Eurasian ancestry, which has little to no signatures of Neanderthal introgression. Bedouin, who have the greatest amount of autochthonous Arab genetic ancestry, may be the direct descendants of Basal Eurasians. Early European Farmers (EEFs), who had some Western European Hunter-Gatherer-related ancestry and originated in the Near East, also derive approximately 44% of their ancestry from Basal Eurasians. Ust‚Äô-Ishim is an approximately 45,000 year old Eurasian without Basal Eurasian ancestry. The later Villabruna Cluster of Western Hunter Gatherers do not have high levels of Basal Eurasian ancestry.

History =Territorial Library= In 1863 the Idaho Territory was created with Lewiston as the capitol, and when the capitol was moved to Boise City in 1866, the Territorial Library was relocated to Boise City with \\"2000 pounds of books\\" from Lewiston. Although not a public library, the Territorial Library served as a venue for public meetings at its location in the 3-room Curtis building, also known as the \\"Stone Jug,\\" until the library was moved in 1872. The Curtis building was demolished in 1899 when the Rocky Mountain Bell Telephone Building was constructed at 609 Main Street. Still not considered a public library, the Territorial Library continued as a public meeting space after 1872, and Boise's Board of Trade was organized at the library in 1883. =Misener & Lamkin= The firm of Misener & Lamkin operated a circulating library in Boise City in the 1860s. The firm, later known as Brown & Lamkin and then as H.H. Lamkin, managed the library from a bookstore at the Boise City post office. And a library operated at Fort Boise as early as 1867, but it was not a public library. =Bennett Committee= In 1874 a committee headed by territorial governor Thomas W. Bennett discussed plans for establishing a university at Boise City, and the committee recommended a free library open both to students and to the public. Centers of higher education in Idaho were later founded in Moscow (1889), in Caldwell (1891), and in Pocatello (1901), but the Bennett committee was unable to establish neither a university nor a free library in Boise City. =Firemen's reading room= In 1882 the Idaho Statesman reported that \\"a movement is on foot to establish a library and literary association in this city,\\" and in 1883 a free library again was in planning, including a plan for $10,000 in capital stock. By 1886 a reading room had been created in the Boise City firehouse, also the location of City Hall, and by 1887 the reading room was billed as the only public library in Idaho. By 1890 the library was under management of the \\"ladies of Boise.\\" In that year the friends of the library began a fundraising campaign to raise $100 per month for acquisitions to the library. In 1894 the firehouse library requested that all circulating books be returned. =Columbian Club= The library came under the management of the Columbian Club, also known as the Columbian Exposition Club, a women's club established in May, 1892, to advance the interests of Idaho during the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. The Columbian Club in 1893 requested space for the library in the new City Hall (1893), and late in 1894 the request was granted by the Boise City Council. When the library opened in 1895, it included furniture formerly on display in the Woman's Room in the Idaho Building at the Columbian Exposition in 1893. The club also hired its first librarian, Ella Reed, in 1895, and in that year the library catalog included 982 books. In 1896 the library counted 12,358 visitors. =Traveling library= The Columbian Club began a traveling library in 1899, and in 1900 the club managed 15 traveling libraries that served regional communities and mining camps. Early in 1901, the Idaho legislature passed a traveling library bill, informally known as the \\"Columbian Club Bill,\\" to promote free public libraries and to establish a state library commission. Carnegie library In 1902 the Idaho State Library Commission requested from Andrew Carnegie that he establish a Carnegie library in Boise. Carnegie agreed to donate $25,000 toward a library if the city provided matching funds, yearly maintenance funds of $2500, and property for a building site. Voters approved a $25,000 bond levy that year, and the city purchased land on Washington Street between 8th and 9th Streets from the Independent School District at a cost of $4000. The site was the location of Pioneer School (1868-1905), built by early residents of Boise City, and the schoolhouse was demolished when the library building was nearing completion. The city council established a board of trustees to oversee the library, and library management passed from the Columbian Club to the city, although the club continued to donate books and materials to the library and to raise money to furnish the new library. Carnegie reduced his gift offer to $15,000 in 1903 when documents he received from the Columbian Club seemed to inflate the local population to 10,000 residents, not 5900 as reported in the 1900 census. Carnegie later revised his gift offer again to $20,000. The 1903 Polk City Directory estimated the local population at 12,256 residents, not including the population of South Boise. In 1905 Carnegie reconsidered his reduction of library funding, and he added $5000 to the amount of his gift. Boise's Carnegie library was designed by Tourtellotte & Co. and built by local contractors Michels & Weber in 1904. Dedication of the building occurred May 3, 1905, and the library opened to the public June 22, 1905. By 1964 the library had outgrown its 11,000 square feet of floor space at the Carnegie library. In the early 1970s, options for the Carnegie building included demolition and use as a senior center, but in 1972 the building was sold at auction to Hon Investment Co. and later converted to office space. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Main library Voters rejected bond measures for construction of a new library, once in 1967 and again in 1969, but a measure to purchase and remodel a warehouse was approved in 1971. The building had been occupied by the Salt Lake Hardware Co. since its completion in 1946, and it contained over 64,000 square feet of floor space. After renovation of the building, the main library opened in 1973 at 715 S Capitol Blvd. The main library floor space was designed to serve a population of 75,000 residents, and to reduce demand at the main library, the city opened branch libraries beginning in 2008, when the population well exceeded 200,000 and the main library had outgrown its building. New main library Plans for a new main library were drawn by architect Moshe Safdie in 2018. Safdie's building would cost $80 million and be ready to open in 2021-22 on the site of Boise's current main library. The building would be divided into three areas: A library with 110,000 square feet of floor space, an event space, and offices for Boise City Department of Arts and History. Groundbreaking is expected later in 2019.

After the film's screening, threats of arrest from Chinese authorities resulted in Ying being exiled from Shanghai. Ying won best director at the Locarno Film Festival. Plot summary The film focuses on a partly fictionalized account of the real-life case of a Chinese man who killed six policemen after he was continually harassed by them. The incident started after he was beaten and taken into custody for riding a bicycle without a license. The plot is from his mother's perspective. Production The film is based on the criminal case of a Chinese man named Yang Jia, who was arrested and beaten because he rode a bicycle without a license. Despite repeated complaints by Yang Jia, the police would not stop their harassment. As a result, Yang Jia killed six policemen with a knife and later received a death sentence. Film director Ying Liang said that he could relate to the incident and said, \\"When I was 11, my father was kept away from home for three years. And my mother's reaction to this family disaster is unforgettable.\\" The finished film was first screened at the Joenju International Film Festival in May 2012. Subsequently, while Ying was in South Korea, he heard from his mother through a phone call that he would be arrested if he returned to Shanghai. Reportedly, policemen arrived to talk to Ying's family in Shanghai several times while using \\"intimidating words\\". Chinese authorities also offered to buy the film's rights from its South Korean owner for $5 million. Ying is still exiled from Shanghai and currently lives in Hong Kong. Reception Stephen Dalton, writing for The Hollywood Reporter, wrote, \\"In the light of such state-sponsored bullying, it feels churlish to criticize When Night Falls for its minimal entertainment value. But the pacing is painfully slow in places, while the lack of factual background seems to undermine Ying‚Äôs intention to illuminate an infamous injustice\\". Richard Brody of The New Yorker said, \\"It‚Äôs a marvellous work of cinematic art, but it‚Äôs also a horrifically fascinating and deeply poignant view of a non-independent judicial system at work: its subject, in effect, is procedural injustice\\".

Stompanato, an ex-Marine and affiliate of the Cohen crime family, had been in a year-long relationship with Turner which had been rocky and marked with physical abuse. Crane and Turner alleged that the former had stabbed Stompanato in the stomach when Turner was ushering him out of her bedroom during a violent argument. Crane had heard the fighting and took a knife from the kitchen, planning to defend her mother. After Crane turned herself in to police in the early morning hours of April 5, she was interred in a juvenile hall. A coroner's inquest was held on April 11, during which the homicide was deemed justifiable, and Crane was exonerated of any wrongdoing. She was released in late April, and placed under the guardianship of her grandmother. Public response to the case was divisive, and numerous press outlets published articles criticizing Turner and likened her testimony during the inquest to that of a performance. Though Crane was cleared of wrongdoing, Stompanato's wife filed a wrongful death lawsuit in June 1958 against her, her father Stephen, and Turner, seeking $750,000 in damages. The lawsuit was eventually settled out of court in 1962 for a sum of $20,000. In the intervening years, Stompanato's homicide has been subject of conspiracy theories that Turner had in fact stabbed him, and that Crane had taken the blame to protect her mother, though Crane has denied this. Stompanato's killing has also been depicted in various media, and was the inspiration for the novel Where Love Has Gone (1962), as well as its subsequent film adaptation. In 2007, Time magazine deemed the case one of the most notorious crimes of the 20th century. Background Turner and Stompanato in Mexico in early 1958 While filming the romantic comedy The Lady Takes a Flyer in the spring of 1957, American film actress Lana Turner began receiving phone calls and flowers on the set from mobster and ex-Marine Johnny Stompanato, using the name \\"John Steele.\\" Turner claimed she was unsure of how he obtained her phone number, but that she learned in later press that allegedly he collected the phone numbers of various Hollywood actresses, including June Allyson, Anita Ekberg and Zsa Zsa Gabor. Stompanato pursued Turner aggressively, sending her various lavish gifts. \\"Thoroughly intrigued\\" by his forthrightness, Turner began casually dating Stompanato. Unbeknownst to her at the time, Stompanato had close ties to the Los Angeles underworld and was an affiliate of gangster Mickey Cohen. Over the following months, Turner and Stompanato carried on a tempestuous relationship filled with violent arguments, physical abuse inflicted upon her by him, and repeated reconciliations. Turner claimed that on one occasion Stompanato drugged her and took nude photographs of her while unconscious, potentially to use as blackmail. In September 1957, while Turner was filming Another Time, Another Place in London, Stompanato disrupted the set and violently choked Turner before being forced off the set by her co-star, Sean Connery. Turner phoned Scotland Yard after the incident, and ultimately had Stompanato deported from the United Kingdom. They subsequently reconciled, and spent January and February 1958 vacationing in Acapulco, Mexico, before returning to the United States. In March 1958, Turner attended the Academy Awards to observe her nomination for Peyton Place and present the award for Best Supporting Actor. Stompanato, angry that she had attended the ceremony without him, assaulted Turner when she arrived home. Homicide Turner's Beverly Hills residence, where Stompanato was killed At approximately 8:00 p.m. on April 4, eight days after the Academy Awards ceremony, Stompanato arrived at Turner's rented home at 730 North Bedford Drive in Beverly Hills, California, which she had just begun leasing a week prior. The two began arguing heatedly in the bedroom, during which Stompanato threatened to kill Turner, her daughter, and her mother, as well as making \\"gangster threats\\" that involved breaking Turner's bones and slashing her face with a straight razor. Her daughter, Cheryl Crane, had briefly entered the room during the argument, but was urged by Turner to leave. In the midst of the ensuing argument, Turner broke off her relationship with Stompanato, and asked him to leave the house. Crane shortly after her arrest Fearing that Turner's life was in danger, Crane, who had been watching television in an adjacent room, grabbed a kitchen knife and ran to her mother's defense. Crane recalled the incident in 2012: Turner corroborated this, stating that Crane, who had been listening to the couple's fight behind the closed door, stabbed Stompanato in the stomach when Turner attempted to usher him out of the bedroom. Turner initially believed Crane had punched him, but realized he had been stabbed when he collapsed and she saw blood on his shirt. Per official police accounts, Crane left the room, placing the knife on a \\"small marble-topped table\\" and rushed to phone her father, Joseph Stephen \\"Steve\\" Crane in the melee. Turner meanwhile called for a doctor, who arrived at the house shortly after; the doctor attempted to revive Stompanato with an adrenaline injection and an artificial respirator. Unable to obtain a pulse, the doctor called for emergency services, thereby notifying the police, and Stompanato was subsequently pronounced dead at the scene. An autopsy conducted by Charles Langhauser shortly after revealed Stompanato's death was caused by a single knife wound that penetrated his liver, portal vein, and aorta, resulting in massive internal hemorrhaging. Confession Police chief Clinton Anderson, who arrived at Turner's home shortly after emergency medical services, stated that Turner had pleaded to him, \\"Please, let me say I did it,\\" after Cheryl had confessed to the stabbing to her father, Stephen, who had also arrived at the home after receiving the frantic phone call from his daughter. Within one hour of the homicide, Turner and her ex-husband had retained attorney Jerry Giesler to represent Cheryl. In the early morning hours of April 5, Cheryl was surrendered at the Beverly Hills Police Department, where she was booked on a holding charge. There, she gave a formal statement to Chief Anderson, detailing her hearing Stompanato's threats against her mother, and her subsequent stabbing of him in the bedroom doorway. After Crane had provided her statement, Turner, Stephen, and Giesler left the station house at the insistence of the police department, as the press had already \\"gathered like vultures outside.\\" In the interim pending further legal proceedings, Crane was interred in a juvenile hall. Legal proceedings =Pre-detention hearing= Stephen Crane, Lana Turner, and Mildred Turner attend pre-detention hearing, April 8, 1958 On April 7, 1958, a juvenile pre- detention hearing was held under Judge Donald O'Dell, closed to the public, which was attended by Turner, her mother Mildred, and ex-husband Stephen. The same day, Turner attempted to file an application for Crane's release into the custody of Mildred, Crane's grandmother. Turner's application was denied, however, as the judge felt that Crane would \\"be better protected by remaining in custody pending the hearing [for Stompanato's murder].\\" A follow-up juvenile detention hearing was scheduled for April 24 in Santa Monica to determine whether Crane permanently remain a ward of the juvenile court. During the ruling, it was noted by press that Crane took the decision \\"without any show of emotion.\\" Upon her dismissal, she was again relocated to a juvenile detention center pending further proceedings. Simultaneous to this pre-detention ruling, numerous love letters between Stompanato and Turner were published in the press. =Coroner's inquest= Due to Turner's high profile and the fact that the killing involved her teenage daughter, the case quickly became a cause c√©l√®bre. Over one hundred reporters and journalists attended the April 11, 1958, coroner's inquest, described by attendees as \\"near- riotous\\". Cohen, Stompanato's friend and associate, was called as the first witness, but refused to provide testimony as he feared he might be implicated in the crime, and also refused to identify Stompanato's body in photographs. While Cohen was questioned, Stephen Trusso, a friend of Stompanato and spectator, interrupted the proceedings by screaming, \\"I want to testify!\\" He went on to claim that Crane killed Stompanato in a lover's quarrel because she was infatuated with him, and that she was jealous of her mother. Trusso's request to testify on the stand was denied by the judge. The second witness, Beverly Hills police chief Clinton Anderson, testified that he was \\"satisfied\\" with Crane's confession to the killing. Joseph B. Payne, a Beverly Hills police officer who was dispatched to the residence on the night of the killing, also testified; on the stand, Payne recounted his arrival at Turner's Bedford Drive home that night, where he was met by Crane's father Stephen, who had placed a call to the police himself. Crane's father, Stephen, testifying at the inquest Additional testimony was provided by Stephen and Mildred. Stephen testified that he had received a frantic phone call from Crane the night of the stabbing, and quickly drove to Turner's home. Mildred, whose own husband (Turner's father) was murdered in 1930, also briefly took the stand, but was so visibly upset that she was excused from further testimony. Beverly Hills police captain Ray Borders provided further testimony regarding Cheryl's official statement given at the Beverly Hills Police Department. Several law enforcement officials, as well as Turner, Stephen Crane, and their attorney, Giesler, were present, and Borders attested that the version of events as told by Cheryl was consistent upon repeated questioning. Cheryl herself did not attend the inquest. In her absence, a written statement by Crane was read aloud, which recounted her overhearing of the argument, her acquiring the knife from the kitchen, and the eventual stabbing of Stompanato in her mother's bedroom. \\"He kept threatening her and I thought he was going to hurt her, so I went into the room and I stuck him with the knife,\\" she said. \\"He screamed and asked what I was doing. I ran out of the room.\\" Turner on the stand Despite the voluminous testimony from others, a report of the inquest in The Philadelphia Inquirer noted that Turner's was \\"the highlight of a circus- like hearing.\\" When Turner took the stand, a \\"hush fell over the crowd as the famous actress sat down, removed one white glove, and filled her lungs with a deep, steady intake of air.\\" She began her testimony by recounting a shopping trip she had taken with Stompanato around 2:00 p.m. on the day of his death, culminating in the argument between them that began around 8:00 p.m. in her home. Recalling the moment Cheryl stabbed him, Turner stated: \\"I was walking toward the bedroom door, and he was right behind me, and I opened it, and my daughter came in. I swear, it was so fast, I‚ÄîI truthfully thought she had hit him in the stomach. The best I can remember, they came together and they parted. I still never saw a blade.\\" Throughout her 62 minutes of testimony, Turner was noted by reporters as nearly collapsing from anxiety. She described Stompanato's final moments, which consisted of \\"the most horrible noises in his throat and gasping.\\" Upon finishing her testimony, Turner returned to her attorney, collapsing in tears. =Exoneration= After four hours of testimony and approximately 25 minutes of deliberation, the jury deemed Stompanato's killing a justifiable homicide, and exonerated Cheryl Crane of any wrongdoing. Crane remained a temporary ward of the court until April 24, when a juvenile court hearing was held, during which presiding Judge Allen T. Lynch expressed concerns over her receiving \\"proper parental supervision.\\" This hearing, unlike the coroner's inquest, was closed to the public. She was ultimately released to the care of her grandmother, and was ordered to regularly visit a psychiatrist alongside her parents. Aftermath =Public response= Immediately following Crane's exoneration, her father Stephen told reporters of the Los Angeles Times that he planned to fight Turner for full custody of his daughter. Reporter Jack Jones wrote: \\"Although Jerry Giesler, Lana's attorney, reported that the actress herself will battle for custody of the couple's daughter... there seemed to be no ill feeling between Crane and his glamorous ex-wife.\\" Though Turner and her daughter were cleared of any wrongdoing, public opinion on the trial was varied, and the day after Crane's exoneration, the Los Angeles Times published a scathing article stating that Turner possessed a \\"lack of almost any reference to moral sensitivity in the presence of a child,\\" concluding that \\"Cheryl isn't the juvenile delinquent. Lana is.\\" Other publications intimated that Turner's testimony at the inquest was a performance; Life magazine published a photo of Turner testifying in court with stills of her in courtroom scenes from three films she had starred in. Columnist Florabel Muir wrote in the New York Daily News that Turner \\"played the most dramatic and effective role of her long screen career here today at the coroner's inquest.\\" The scandal coincided with the release of Turner's film Another Time, Another Place, which was met with poor box-office receipts and a lackluster critical response. =Wrongful death lawsuit= Stompanato's brother Carmine, who attended the inquest, alleged afterward that he felt Turner \\"failed to tell the whole truth,\\" and that law enforcement had \\"made up their mind right from the start that Johnny deserved to die.\\" Stompanato's ex-wife, Sarah Ibrahaim, filed a wrongful death suit of $750,000 () in damages against both Turner, Cheryl, and Stephen Crane, on behalf of herself and then-7-year-old John Jr., her son with Stompanato. In the suit, it was implied that Turner was responsible for stabbing Stompanato, and that her daughter had taken the blame. The suit alleged that Stephen arrived at Turner's residence prior to Stompanato's death, and failed to summon proper medical assistance. Depositions in the wrongful death suit began in June 1958. William Jerome Pollack, the attorney overseeing the case, presented evidence suggesting that Stompanato had been stabbed while lying down, which conflicted with the accepted version of events. An amended complaint alleged that the plaintiff was uncertain \\"whether it was Defendant Cheryl Crane or Defendant Lana Turner who did the actual stabbing, or whether the one assisted the other therein. Because of said doubt, plaintiff allege[d] that both of said defendants did inflict the said stab wound in the body of John Stompanato.\\" Representing Turner, Cheryl, and Stephen in the wrongful death lawsuit was attorney Lowell Dryden. On June 23, 1958, the three, accompanied by Dryden, visited Pollack's law offices in Los Angeles for a meeting. Pollack subsequently reported: \\"Cheryl told [me] yesterday that she cannot recall actually stabbing Stompanato in the pink-carpeted bedroom of Lana's rented Beverly Hills mansion.\\" Pollack further stated that Cheryl could not recall providing the written statement read on her behalf during the April 11 inquest. The suit was submitted to the court of Walter Allen, and was eventually settled out of court for a reported $20,000 in May 1962. =Legacy and conspiracy theories= Stompanato's homicide has had an enduring presence in true crime popular culture and mythology, and was named one of the \\"crimes of the century\\" by Time magazine in 2007. Film historian Sam Staggs noted that it \\"belongs in the same pantheon of foul deeds as the Fatty Arbuckle rape trial in 1921, the ambiguous death of Marilyn Monroe in 1962, and the O. J. Simpson case of 1994‚Äì95.\\" In the intervening years, Stompanato's homicide has been subject to an oft-repeated conspiracy theory that Turner in fact killed him, and that Crane had taken culpability for her mother, claiming self- defense. This theory was exacerbated when Eric Root, a hairdresser of Turner's, claimed in a 1996 memoir that Turner confessed to him that she had stabbed Stompanato during their domestic struggle. According to Root, Turner made the confession to him years later at the Plaza Hotel, after the two saw a television program referencing the case; Root claims that Turner allegedly blurted out: \\"I killed the son of a bitch, and I would do it again.\\" He also stated that Turner urged to him to reveal this to the public should she die before him, in order to clear her daughter's name. Crane, however, denied this claim, responding in 1999: \\"This idea that Root had in his book is so far- fetched... You know, everybody has something they want to sell. I guess it was the only way he could get his book published.\\" Additionally, Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer stylist Sydney Guilaroff noted in his 1996 memoir that, on the morning of Stompanato's murder, he had run into Turner leaving the Pioneer Hardware store in Beverly Hills; during a brief exchange, Guilaroff alleged that when he asked Turner what she was doing at the hardware store, she responded: \\"We needed a new knife.\\" Guilaroff further claimed that he visited Turner the following day, and that she collapsed in his arms, sobbing, and said, \\"Did you ever dream this could happen? And with the very knife I bought yesterday.\\" In her own autobiography, Turner conceded that she and Stompanato had gone shopping for kitchen utensils for Turner's new home the week he died, and that he had in fact been stabbed with one of the carving knives he had purchased. In 2012, 48 Hours presented a special profiling the case, which featured conversation between several historians, Crane, and John Ibrahim, Stompanato's son. Ibrahim contested that Turner's testimony was \\"all lies\\" and that she \\"could have got an Academy Award,\\" to which Crane responded: Cultural depictions A 1962 novel by Harold Robbins entitled Where Love Has Gone was inspired by Stompanato's death, followed by a 1964 film adaptation starring Susan Hayward and Bette Davis. In November 2009, Sara Davies premiered a radio drama for BBC 4 titled A Night with Johnny Stompanato by playwright Jonathan Holloway, which is based on the case.

Each flower is 3 to 6cm wide and has about 32 stamens. The form of their deep pink calyxes resembles the corollas of cyclamen flowers, inspiring the specific epithet. The fruit, a drupe, is subglobose, purplishred, and 7.5 to 8.3mm in diameter with scant but tasty flesh. They are relished by birds. Distribution Cyclamin cherry is found in Guangdong, Guangxi, Hubei, Hunan, and Sichuan provinces in China.

History After the 1702 siege of St. Augustine and its burning to the ground by troops under the command of James Moore, governor of the English colony of Carolina, the Spanish determined to improve the defenses of St. Augustine outside the confines of their massive masonry fortress, the Castillo de San Marcos. Because the English had entered the city by way of the peninsula on which the town sat, in 1704 Governor Jos√© de Z√∫√±iga ordered the building of a defensive system around the exposed sides of the town to prevent another invasion by land. By 1705, the Cubo Line consisted of an earth defensive wall covered with sharp-leaved yucca surrounding a nine-foot-high palm log stockade that stretched about half a mile from the Castillo to the San Sebastian River. This defensive line, with six small redoubts, demarcated the northern limits of St. Augustine from the northwest bastion westward to the San Sebastian River. An approximately 40-foot wide moat ran parallel to the line, with a small drawbridge spanning it at the town's main gate. In 1706 work commenced on another wall about a half mile north of the Cubo Line, called the Hornabeque Line (or Hornwork Line) for its \\"Horns\\", or demi-bastions, that protruded like the horns of a bull at both ends. An additional defensive wall, the Rosario Line, was built in 1718 running south from the Santo Domingo Redoubt for almost a mile then turning east to Matanzas Bay. These inner defensive walls prevented Gen. James Oglethorpe, the governor of the English colony of Georgia, from occupying or razing St. Augustine during his siege of 1740. The Mose Line, St. Augustine's outermost defense earthwork, running three quarters of a mile southwest from Fort Mose, was not constructed until 1762, one year before the Spanish evacuated St. Augustine after its transfer to the British by the terms of the Treaty of Paris in 1763. All the defensive lines measured half a mile or more in length, each of them associated with a fort: the Cubo and Rosario Lines with the Castillo de San Marcos; the Hornabeque Line with Fort Nombre de Dios; and the Mose Line with Fort Mose. In its first reconstruction (1718‚Äì1719), the Cubo Line became an earthwork with three artillery redoubts, the Santo Domingo, the Medio Cubio, and the Cubo. In 1808, the Cubo line was again reconstructed and two masonry (coquina) pillars were built to support the wooden gate doors. In 1820, the newly appointed royal engineer, Ram√≥n de la Cruz, proposed improvements to the Cubo line that were implemented by June 1821, when Spain officially ceded Florida to the United States, fulfilling the terms of the Adams‚ÄìOn√≠s Treaty signed in 1819. In his submitted description of its condition at the time, de la Cruz refers to the Cubo redoubt and the Middle and Tolomato redoubts (previously known as the Medio and Santo Domingo redoubts).

Remnant bushland in places like Blackwattle Bay retain elements of traditional plant, bird and animal life, including fish and rock oysters. With the invasion of the Sydney region, the Cadigal and Wangal people were decimated but there are descendants still living in Sydney today. All cities include many immigrants in their population. Aboriginal people from across the state have been attracted to suburbs such as Pyrmont, Balmain, Rozelle, Glebe and Redfern since the 1930s. Changes in government legislation in the 1960s provided freedom of movement enabling more Aboriginal people to choose to live in Sydney. The street marks the side boundaries of allotments which first appeared on James Meehan's map of 1807, sloping down to the Tank Stream from the street that became Macquarie Place.LEP, 2005 Bulletin Place is situated on land reclaimed from the mouth of the historic Tank Stream, which today runs underneath Pitt Street.Sing, 1988 The site was part of the grant of 1 acre 37 ‚Äì 1/2 roods made by Governor Macquarie to Andrew Thompson on 1 January 1810. It seems that Mary Reibey, one of the best known early merchants, also owned the land at one time. Thompson was a wealthy emancipist merchant and a favourite of the then Governor, Captain Bligh. When he died in September 1818, the land was sold to William Browne, a Sydney merchant, for . He sold it to Prosper de Mestre in 1828 for . De Mestre was a prominent mercantile and public figure, but later fell into financial trouble in the early 1840s depression. In 1875 the property was sold again, to Edward Terry. Terry and his wife, Eleanor, let it to tenants. The first reference to \\"Bulletin Place\\" was in Sands Sydney Directory in 1867, when it was described as a lane. By 1870 it had been upgraded into a passageway, and in 1890 it was recorded as Bulletin Place. Bulletin Place is the only Sydney thoroughfare named after a publication, for it was here that J. F. Archibald's famous weekly The Bulletin was published for many years following its foundation in 1880. The Bulletin owned stores and offices at the intersection of the passageway with Pitt Street. Bulletin Place is situated on land reclaimed from the mouth of the historic Tank Stream, which today runs underneath Pitt Street. The Bulletin remained in this location until 1897, when it moved to newer and larger offices in George Street. It appears that the warehouses were erected before 1880, as it appears in Percy Dove's Sydney map of that year. Its basic form suggests an earlier date of construction. Howells dates the building as \\"s\\". It underwent reinstatement after a fire in 1937 and became a wine bottling and filtering facility in 1950. In 1981 the ground floor was used for wine auctions. From 1880 to 1884 it was occupied by Mrs Eliza Tinsley, ironmonger. Merchant brothers Mahlon Clarke and Thomas Cowlishaw acquired the property in March 1888 from Edward Terry. The Cowlishaw Bros. were heavily involved in the coal trade. A s photo indicates that this building was part of a larger warehouse that extended to Pitt Street demolished in 1965 for the construction of Export House. The warehouse, at the corner of Pitt Street and Bulletin Place (leased as offices) was owned by Bernhardt Otto Holtermann who had a successful commercial agency there between 1877 and 1885. He is best known for his mine at Hill End, which yielded the largest gold reef specimen in the world. Sydney City Council paved both Bulletin Place and Macquarie Place turning them into pedestrian walkways. Council records of 1955 note that at least a part of the building was used for printing, duplicating, typing and bookbinding. The Cowlishaws retained ownership until 1955. Other companies which have occupied the warehouse are: Sandy & Co. Glass, Oil & Colour Stores; Chard Marshall; J. C. Steel Tanners; Harrison & Whitton Skin & Produce Merchants; and the Sydney Volcanic Aerated Water Company. In later years it was used for a variety of purposes including manufacturing and commercial operations, and in the 1960s became a restaurant and cocktail bar. Its facade was restored in 1973. Northbourne Developments bought all three Bulletin Place properties 6‚Äì8, 10‚Äì12 and 14‚Äì18 in 1986. In 1988 they renovated three warehouses lining Bulletin Place (6‚Äì8; 10‚Äì14; 16‚Äì18) using Clive Lucas, Stapleton & Partners heritage consultants) and constructed a $150million dollar retail and office complex on the corner adjoining Macquarie Place development at the end of the street on the corner of Macquarie Place. The major development complex was due for completion in March 1990. The oldest building (16‚Äì18 Bulletin Place) leased to Len Evans Wine Co.) was established around 1895 as a two-storey warehouse belonging to Austin's Stores. The second-oldest (6‚Äì8 Bulletin Place) leased by Bulletin Place restaurant) was originally owned by Elliot Bros. Druggists and then became the premises of Tinsley Ironmonger. The third warehouse, is 10‚Äì14 Bulletin Place, on the corner of Pitt Street, (leased to the Len Evans Wine Company) was established around 1895 as a two-storey warehouse belonging to Austin & Co. Sydney City Council paved both Bulletin Place and Macquarie Place turning them into pedestrian walkways. Restoration of the facade occurred in l990. A Japanese takeaway food business was established in 1993, followed by a first floor restaurant in 1994. In May 1993 the property was sold by Depaxu Pty Ltd and acquired by Nezaba Pty Ltd. The present use of 6‚Äì8 Bulletin Place as a souvenir business commenced in 1993. In 1993 the property was sold by Northbourne and bought by financial planners MacDonald McGregor.  Description  =6‚Äì8 Bulletin Place= Three storey brick Victorian Free Classical style building. This building is one of three former adjacent warehouses in Bulletin Place. It is built of loadbearing brickwork, finished in stucco lined to simulate ashlar and decorated in a Free Classical manner and painted. The symmetrical facade is embraced by slender pilasters with debased Corinthian capitals, topped by a parapet treated as an entablature with a bracketed frieze. The floor levels are marked by string courses embellished with paterae. Windows are double hung sashes with bracketed stone sills. The wide doorway (original loading doorway) has a segmented arch head with stone impost blocks. The roughly finished north-west end wall indicates where this building continued as part of 2 Bulletin Place, now demolished. The internal structure, three bays wide and two bays deep, has chamfered timber storey posts, girders and joists. The roof is supported on posts tenoned into a beam. The ceiling is lined with boards and there is a single rooflight. There is a timber stair of two flights.

Internally the timber posts and some of the girders are still visible, although interior fittings and surfaces have in recent years been adapted for use as a souvenir shop.  Modifications and dates  Intrusive Elements:Illuminated vertical projecting and wall signs. =10‚Äì14 Bulletin Place= One of a group of former warehouses whose scale and diversity is a rare surviving reminder of the undisciplined 19th-century commercial development of Sydney Cove, and gives a pleasant pedestrian character, rare in the City of Sydney, to the narrow spaces of Bulletin Place and Reiby Place. A three-storey former warehouse of Flemish bond sandstock brick. Three-bay front, 18-pane shuttered windows with sandstone sills and brick lintels. Gabled roof with modern box gutter; facade to ground floor rendered and modernised. Window layout and floor heights suggest it may have been built with No. 6-8, with faulty render since removed. Date: before 1880. The building was occupied by Elliot Bros Stores in 1883-4 (SANDS DIRECTORY). The architectural style: 19th Century. The building material is sandstock brick.NTA, 1982 =16‚Äì18 Bulletin Place= 16‚Äì18 Bulletin Place is the largest of three adjoining similarly-scaled former warehouses in Bulletin Place. It is a brick building four storeys high, with a basement half a storey below street level. Structurally it is divided into four longitudinal bays and two lateral bays, with heavy timber posts, girders, joists, floors and trusses mostly still visible. The sliding timber loading doors retain their chained footplates and overhead cat-head hoist beams and pulleys; one cathead still protected by a gable. The windows have flat segmental arched heads, picked out in lined colourwash; all have sandstone sills and all but those of the top storey have iron Grilles. The main walling, laid in Flemish bond, employs cream common bricks said to have been imported from Scotland. The interior, though refurbished in 1967 and the 1980s still has original timber structure and some fittings visible.

Thus the rhythm of the openings on each storey is 2-windows, 1-door, 2-windows, 1-door, 2-windows. Though described elsewhere as \\"in the vernacular tradition\\", it is a sophisticated design. The sheaves and cylinder of a hydraulic hoist survive beside the top loading doorway at the north-west end of the building.

This is the first known European oil painting to depict a night corroboree by Australian Aborigines. Description Joseph Lycett was the first convict artist to broadly depict the transformation of the Australian colony into a free settlement.Hoorn, J. (2018). Colony: Australia 1770‚Äì1861/Frontier Wars. Australian and New Zealand Journal of Art, 18(2), 286-290.

Joseph Lycett : Governor Macquarie's convict artist / John Turner. Newcastle, N.S.W.: Hunter History Publications, p.88-89. In this imagined scene Aborigines perform campfire ceremonies on the banks of the Hunter River surrounded by casuarinas and mangroves, with distant Nobby's Island and the European signal station lit up by the full moon.Walker, R. (1998). Shaping, Painting Two New Worlds. The Christian Science Monitor, p. 8. Lycett has depicted a number of indigenous activities in different parts of the canvas. In one a tooth evulsion is taking place while under a tree a group of men are gathered around a fire sharing a clay pipe.Shane Frost, We Have Survived, 10 Works in Focus, Paintings from the Collection, State Library of New South Wales, 2018. James Gleeson, who attributed this painting to Captain James Wallis of the 46th Regiment, interpreted the scene by the large gum tree to the right as a woman being beaten for intruding on an all-male ceremony.

Life Damcke was born in the so-called \\"French period\\" in Hannover. He first studied theology and later music in Frankfurt as a pupil of Aloys Schmitt who was appointed court organist and chamber musician of the Duke Adolph von Cambridge in Hanover in 1826 as well as Ferdinand Ries. In 1834, Damcke made an appearance in his hometown \\"[...] probably for a short time\\" as violist in the Kingdom of Hanover court orchestra, which at that time still existed in the and was located in the east wing of the Leineschloss.Hugo Thielen: \\"Schlosstheater, auch Schlossopernhaus\\", in . . However, he continued to study the piano and organ, also composing his first choral works. Later, Damcke moved to Bad Kreuznach where he conducted the local Musikverein and the Liedertafel and wrote the Oratorio Deborah. In 1837, Damcke went to Potsdam, where he conducted the Philharmonische Gesellschaft Potsdam as well as the Gesangsverein f√ºr Opernmusik, with which he performed his Christmas Oratorio in 1840 and in the following year the Psalm 23 as well as an Ave Maria. Also still in 1841, Damcke took over the position of conductor in K√∂nigsberg. There, his opera Das K√§thchen von Heilbronn after Heinrich von Kleist was premiered in 1845.Notwithstanding this, up to this point there have been considerable deviations and/or additions to Damcke's vita in contemporary sources such as the stays in Berlin and the award of a gold medal for art; see, for example, Carl Friedrich von Ledebur: Tonk√ºnstler-Lexicon Berlin's from the oldest times to the present.

In 1855, he moved to Brussels. From 1859, Damcke lived and worked in Paris, where he wrote for various German and Russian journals. He also worked as a teacher, both privately and at the Conservatoire de Paris. One of his private pupils was Georges Pfeiffer. Damcke was friends with Hector Berlioz whom he had sponsored and whom he had already met in 1847 on the occasion of his guest performance in St. Petersburg.
