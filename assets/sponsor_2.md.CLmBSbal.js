It consists of interviews with emergency medical workers and mental health experts as well as dramatic re-creations of emergency calls experienced by the interview subjects. It was directed by Kevin Eastwood and produced and commissioned by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation for the Docs POV television program. Summary The documentary recounts the stories of three paramedics who suffered traumatic incidents during the course of their careers and subsequently developed symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, including severe depression and substance abuse. Experts cite statistics and research showing paramedics to be at particular risk for PTSD and suicide and discuss the bureaucratic roadblocks faced by paramedics who attempt to seek treatment. The documentary is structured to highlight similarities in the paramedics‚Äô stories, from their initial idealism and hope about their careers, through the traumatic incidents that stood out from the normal pressures of their profession. Also highlighted are the periods of depression and self-medication with alcohol and/or drugs, suicidal ideation or suicide attempts and the paramedics struggles with recovery. Awards The film was nominated for Best Documentary by the Academy of Canadian Cinema & Television at the 2019 Canadian Screen Awards, Best Documentary (Social/Political) at the Yorkton Golden Sheaf Awards, five Leo Awards (including Best Short Documentary and Best Direction, winning for Best Cinematography and Best Score) and won the Mindset Award for Workplace Mental Health Reporting at the 2019 CAJ Awards. Featured individuals * Clive Derbyshire is a paramedic based in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. He works in Downtown Eastside, a Neighbourhood whose residents have a disproportionately high rate of homelessness, mental health problems, and addictions. He believes his PTSD derives from his experience responding to a motor vehicle accident incident in which a close friend died. * Natalie Harris is a retired paramedic from Barrie, Ontario, who cites treating, and later encountering in court, multiple-murderer Mark Dobson as the source of her PTSD,https://www.thestar.com/news/crime/2015/01/15/man- guilty-of-murdering-two-women-in-barrie-in-satanic-suicide-pact.html which sparked addictions to alcohol and prescription drugs. * Don Devine was among the first Canadians to train as a paramedic in the 1970s. He worked in the Vernon, British Columbia region and in 1996 responded to the scene of the massacre of the Ghakal family, after which he developed symptoms of PTSD. * Cheryl Drewitz-Cheney is a former nurse and the author of the study ‚ÄúPosttraumatic Stress Disorder among Paramedics‚Äù. She has studied the high incidents of addiction, suicide, PTSD, and related conditions among first responders. * Vince Savoia is a former emergency dispatcher and the founder and executive director of the Tema Conter Memorial Trust, an Ontario-based support group for sufferers of PTSD in the first-responder and military communities. He discusses the culture of the paramedic profession and the challenges faced by some first responders who seek treatment. Production Director Kevin Eastwood initially met Derbyshire during the filming of Knowledge Network‚Äôs factual series Emergency Room: Life + Death at VGH. In an interview with a Vancouver Sun reporter, Eastwood said, \\"I didn‚Äôt know him well, but I knew him by face and we had been friendly in the emergency room. I had always seen him as being this charismatic, attractive, really good at his job, really confident, good paramedic. To learn what he was actually struggling with on the inside, well, I had no idea.\\" Release The documentary aired on CBC Television on April 8, 2018 but was pre-empted in some provinces by the broadcast of the Humboldt Broncos vigil. CBC aired the program in the rest of Canada on April 9. Impact Three days after the initial broadcast, the NDP Government announced Bill 9 ‚Äì 2018: Workers Compensation Amendment Act, which included changes to Worksafe regulations. Prior to this change, BC first-responders who developed PTSD were required to prove to Worksafe BC that their condition was related to their work to receive the benefits associated with work-related injuries. If the legislation is approved, the burden of proof would not fall upon the first-responders, making it easier for PTSD sufferers to access benefits and treatment options. British Columbia MLA Andrew Weaver summarized the change: \\"This bill updates the Workers Compensation Act for eligible occupations (corrections officer, an emergency medical assistant, a firefighter, a police officer, a sheriff or other as prescribed by regulation) who are exposed to one or more traumatic events over the course of their employment and are subsequently diagnosed with a mental disorder. The disorder will be presumed to have been caused by the nature of their work rather than having to prove that it was work-related. British Columbia is one of the last such jurisdictions in Canada to have such legislation.\\"  References  Category:Canadian documentary television films Category:English-language films Category:Films shot in British Columbia Category:Documentary films about health care Category:2018 television films Category:Films shot in Ontario Category:Documentary films about mental health Category:Documentary films about post-traumatic stress disorder Category:Canadian films Category:2018 films Category:2018 documentary films ","title":"After the Sirens"},{"id":"58064171","text":"Jannik Dehm (born 2 May 1996) is a German professional footballer who plays as a right-back for Holstein Kiel.

Roman origins  The Gulf of Naples was a particular locus of the development of Roman villas from roughly 50 BCE to 200 CE, where they were built as retreats and status symbols by senators and the like. Of the many villas of this era discovered in Boscoreale, Naples, buried in the eruption of Mount Vesuvius that also buried Pompeii, one now visible is the Villa Regina. That was a villa rustica ‚Äì a rustic villa, as distinguished from a villa urbana, which would have been grander.

The building was constructed in 1917 and was home, for many decades, to two well-known Pittsburgh candy companies, Reymer & Brothers and Bolan's Candies, prior to its demolition in the 2010s.  History  The building which housed these two historical Pittsburgh-based candy companies was built in 1917 by an unknown architect. The building was soon bought by an expanding candy company called Reymer & Brothers. =Reymer & Brothers= Reymer & Brothers was founded in 1846, originally called Reymer and Anderson, by Philip Reymer and R.J Anderson. At the time it was the first confectionery store in Pittsburgh.Edward Byrnes Collection, 1869-1961, MSS 0676, Library and Archives Division, Senator John Heinz History Center. Despite the store's initial popularity, Anderson unexpectedly left the business after a few years and Reymer bought his shares to establish himself as the sole proprietor. In 1861, Reymer's two brothers, Jacob S. and Harmar D. joined the firm, and it was renamed to Reymer & Brothers.‚Äò100 Years of Candy Making,‚Äô The Pittsburgh Press, October 8, 1955, Pg. 88. By the 1870s the company had expanded significantly, so much so that they were forced to purchase a new factory to allow for the increased production of more confectionary. Reymer & Brothers' confectionary was considered to be the best in Pittsburgh, and had a reputation for using the finest ingredients.‚ÄòReymer & Brothers, Inc.,‚Äô The Story of Pittsburgh, Volume 1, Pittsburgh First National Bank, 1919. The company was credited with popularizing the chocolate egg candy, and also sold exotic fruits, nuts, spices, flavored sugars, bon-bons, cookies, and crackers.Notable men of Pittsburgh and Vicinity, Percy Frazer Smith, Pittsburg Printing Co., 1901, pg.68, 374. The company was perhaps most famous for the beverage Lemon Blennd, also known as Lemn Blend or Lem-N-Blennd. Lemon Blennd was created in 1914 by druggist E. J. W. Keagy in the North Side of Pittsburgh, and was originally sold as a frozen ice slush drink. Keagy closed his store in 1928 and proceeded to sell his beverage through stands on the boardwalk at Atlantic City, New Jersey. By 1932, Reymer & Brothers was struggling significantly due to the effects of the Great Depression, with some reports indicating that they were losing as much as $200,000 a year.History of Pittsburgh and Environs, Volume 3, George Thornton Fleming, American Historical Society, 1922, pg.659. There was both a lack of demand for their products, and a summertime slow-down caused by the melting of the chocolate in the heat. In 1932, they purchased Lemon Blennd from Keagy, hoping to boost their sales in the summer. The purchase was a wise one, as Lemon Blennd became a Pittsburgh favorite, which helped Reymer & Brothers stay in business for another 30 years. Reymer & Brothers was purchased by the H.J Heinz Company in 1960. Following Reymer & Brothers tenure in the shop at 6018 Penn Ave, it became occupied by another famous Pittsburgh candy company, Bolan's Candies. =Bolan's Candies= Bolan's Candies was founded in 1975 as a confectionary store in the Highland Park area of Pittsburgh. Bolan's occupied the 6018 Penn Avenue location for a number of years, becoming a local Pittsburgh favorite. The company has since reduced production and now operates out of a single location, producing candy in very limited quantities. =Building demolished= The building, along with a number of adjacent buildings, was bought by East Liberty Development Inc. in 2006. Despite the protests of numerous citizens, and the historical significance of the buildings, they were demolished in the 2010s. The site is now home to the Penn Highland Building, a retail apartment building. In an attempt to save the site, the building was nominated in January 2015 as a City Historic Site by Preservation Pittsburgh.  Architecture  The building at 6018 Penn Ave was constructed in 1917 in the Commercial Gothic Revival architectural style. The exterior of the building was occupied by a terracotta veneer, and had an ornate design on the second floor, which replaced the original glass fa√ßade of the building in the 1950s. The building today no longer stands as it did, and along with several of the buildings next door to it, is now the site of a modern style apartment building.

In 1956 Altamirano was jailed thrice, during the wave of repression that took place after the killing of Anastasio Somoza Garc√≠a. In the same year he began organizing a union for mechanics and metal workers in Managua. He became a member of the Nicaraguan Socialist Party (PSN) in 1959. In 1960 he became a member of the leadership of the Federacion de Trabajadores de Managua. In 1961 he founded the Socialist Youth of Nicaragua, the PSN youth wing. He became a member of the central leadership of the Confederaci√≥n General del Trabajo (independiente) trade union centre in 1962. He stayed in exile in Cuba between April 1963 and March 1964, after which he left for studies in Moscow.

Upon his release he was named general secretary of POSN. Taking over the control of POSN, he expelled the older leadership. In December 1970 POSN held its constitutive congress, adopting the name Communist Party of Nicaragua and electing Altamirano as its general secretary. Under Altamirano's leadership the Communist Party took an anti- Sandinista stance, isolating itself from the broader revolutionary movement.

Dalit women primarily live in South Asia, mainly in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Dalit women face different challenges than women in higher castes in these countries. They are more likely to be poor, uneducated and socially marginalized. Dalit feminists advocate and have advocated for equal rights for Dalit women based on gender, caste and other issues. They have addressed conferences, created organizations and helped elect other Dalit women into political office.  Background  Dalit women are part of a marginalized group of people who make up part of what are officially known as Scheduled Castes in India, though there are also Dalit women in Nepal, Pakistan, Bangladesh and in Sri Lanka. In Nepal, Dalit women are 13.2% of the population. Most of the Dalit women in Pakistan live in the Punjab region, according to a 1998 census. Overall, Dalit women make up the \\"largest socially segregated\\" group of people in the world at 2% of the world's population. Dalit women also tend to live in poverty, and many are illiterate. Dalit women face oppression not only from men in higher castes, but also from other Dalit men. In addition, there is a hierarchy among Dalit groups, with some Dalits being higher up on the social scale than others. Dalit women face violence at higher rates, including types of violence that are specifically done to Dalit women. Certain types of forced prostitution such as the devadasi or jogini system are reserved specifically for Dalit women. In addition, Dalit victims of violence and their families often do not know their rights or are not informed of their rights. The police may show up when a Dalit women reports a violent attack, but they may not investigate or take action to hold the perpetrator responsible. Sexual violence against Dalit women is considered \\"a regular and routine phenomenon of oppression,\\" according to Kiran Kumar Boddu and Siva Nagaiah Bolleddu, writing in the English Studies International Research Journal. Dalit sexuality has long been \\"constructed as deviant\\" by higher castes due to Dalit women's lower caste status. Their bodies were considered \\"sexually available\\" by British colonists. In Nepal, a study conducted in 2013 found that 50.6% of Dalit women faced daily forms of violence, including physical and sexual abuse. In addition, many Nepali Dalit women must adhere to the practice of Chhaupadi. In Pakistan, Dalit women face kidnappings and forced conversion to Islam. Historically, the Dalit rights movement has focused more heavily on Dalit men and Dalit women's issues have often been ignored by mainstream Indian feminism. The larger Indian women's movement, largely run by middle and upper class women, has been criticized by Dalit women for ignoring issues that they uniquely faced. Feminist academics in India have also ignored the caste issues that Dalit women faced. As expressed by Swaroopa Rani, Indian feminists saw all women as being the same, and therefore having the same problems. Dalit feminists challenge this idea. Dalit feminism claims that 'caste' and 'gender,' instead of being seen as two mutually exclusive categories, should be envisioned as intersectional.  History  = India = Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar with Women delegates of the Scheduled Caste Federation during the Conference of the Federation on July 8, 1942 at Nagpur. In the 1920s, Dalit women were active in anti-caste and anti-untouchability movements. Dalit women were involved in the Non-Brahman movement in the 1930s. These early organizations helped pass resolutions against issues such as child marriage, dowries and enforced widowhood. In 1942, 25,000 Dalit women attended the All India Depressed Classes Women Conference in Nagpur. President of the conference, Sulochanabai Dongre, advocated for birth control. During the conference, resolutions were passed which advocated for a women's right to divorce, denounced polygamy, improved labor conditions, improved women's involvement in politics and better education for women in lower classes. Dalit women were also involved in social movements of the 1970s and early 80s. In the 1970s, autobiographies of Dalit women's lives and experiences began to be published. Many of these women were inspired by Babasaheb Ambedkar. Mainstream feminist thought in India during the 1980s and 1990s began to recognize issues surrounding caste. This was a marked change from the various feminist movements in the 70s and 80s which did not address caste issues. The first national meeting of Dalit women took place in Bangalore in 1987. In the 1990s, several organizations created by Dalit women were formed, such as the National Federation of Dalit Women and the All India Dalit Women's Forum along with several state-level groups. Dalit women were careful to express that these kinds of organizations for Dalit women were not meant to be divisive or separatist, and that there existed a need for continued alliances with Dalit men and non-Dalit women. However, Dalit women also felt that they needed to speak for themselves. Dalit women sent delegates to the 1993 World Conference against Racism and the 1995 World Conference on Women. Leading up to the World Conference on Women in Beijing, Dalit women had held a national conference in Dehli. For the 2001 World Conference Against Racism, Dalit women advocated that discrimination based on caste be added to language against racism. Adding this type of language would put global pressure on the Indian government. However, in coalition with the United States, the clause to prevent discrimination against Dalit women was dropped in 2001. Despite the clause being dropped, international coverage meant that discrimination based on caste was finally globally recognized. In 2002, Khabar Lahariya (News Waves), the first newspaper written by and for Dalit women was created. Khabar Lahariya focuses on issues in the Dalit community in their own languages. The newspaper won a UNESCO literacy prize in 2009. Dalit women participated in critiques of New Economic Policy (NEP) at the 2003 Asian Social Forum and the 2004 World Social Forum (WSF). In 2007, a panel made up of women from Africa and South Asia called \\"Combatting Caste and Descent and Descent Based Discrimination in Africa and Asia\\" was discussed at the WSF. In March 2006, the first National Conference on Violence Against Dalit Women took place in New Delhi. This conference passed the \\"Delhi Declaration,\\" which laid out how Dalit women faced \\"disparities in the prevalence of violence, poverty, and sickness\\" and described the way that dominant castes were responsible for these disparities. In November 2006, there was an International Conference on the Human Rights of Dalit Women held at the Hague. The Hague conference not only addressed violence against Dalit women, but also discussed their own identities and created a sense of group solidarity. Dalit women recognized that they had an identity \\"forged in 'multiple struggles.'\\" The Hague conference not only called for the creation of laws to protect human rights for Dalit women, but also that these laws be duly enforced or implemented. Also in 2006, the idea of \\"Dalit womanism\\" was created. = Nepal = Dalit women in Nepal face many of the same issues as Dalit women in India. Throughout post-1990 Nepal, the woman's movement was affected by turbulent politics. A Nepali feminist, Durga Sob, created the Feminist Dalit Organization (FEDO) in 1994. By 2010, FEDO had around 40,000 members and worked to send Dalit children to school and provide training and classes for adults. Women's political parties, while marginalized, have helped push women's rights issues in Nepal. However, these parties are dominated by higher-caste women. Lower-caste women have criticized the party's efforts and pointed out that not all Nepali women face the same problems. FEDO has been involved in helping Dalit women in Nepal become more involved in politics. In 2014, a conference organized by FEDO and held in Kathmandu drew hundreds of Dalit women and included speakers from the United Nations, such as Ziad Sheikh, the Resident Coordinator on Dalit Rights. = Pakistan = Dalit women in Pakistan are less subject to caste issues, but because most are part of a minority religion in the country, they are persecuted because of their religious backgrounds. However, this doesn't mean there isn't still caste-based discrimination. The first Dalit woman senator in Pakistan, Krishna Kumari Kohli, was elected in 2018.  Today  In the present day, activists such as Ruth Manorama work on legal and political actions to empower Dalit women. Manorama has spoke out about how laws that are meant to protect women in Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes are poorly implemented. Often complaints and reports filed by Dalit women are ignored. In addition, Asha Kowtal of the All India Dalit Mahila Adhikar Manch (AIDMAM) says that India is \\"stonewalling any discussion on caste.\\" AIDMAM, in conjunction with the Krantijyoti Savitribai Phule Women's Studies Center (KSPWSC), held a 2017 conference called \\"Dalit Women Speak Out\\" which attracted around 450 delegates and participants. AIDMAM presented testimonies of gender and caste-based violence at the 38th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council in 2018. The report, called Voices Against Caste Impunity: Narratives of Dalit Women in India and presented to the United Nations (UN), was the first report on caste-based violence against women to be given to the UN.  Literature  Literature by Dalit women \\"is an attempt to articulate unheard, unspoken voices.\\" Dalit women's writing brings issues of caste identity to feminist literature. Similarly, valid depictions of Dalit women's experiences have been overlooked in the writing of Dalit men. Translations of Dalit literature into English has largely been done by individuals outside of the Dalit experience, and author and translator, Meena Kandasamy, has identified this as a problem, since important nuances in language are often overlooked. Kandasamy has also discussed how, since many of these works deal with politics, they are not seen as true literature. Prominent women writers of Dalit literature in the Telugu language include Challapalli Swaroopa Rani, Joopaka Subhadra, Jajula Gowri, Swathy Margaret and Gogu Shyamala. These writers have primarily used poetry, short stories, essays and more to challenge the intersectional forms of oppression they faced. Dalit women's literature reveal that systems of caste and gender are connected and particular disadvantages for Dalit women result in experiences of oppression that are distinct from that of upper caste women and Dalit men. Dallit women‚Äôs autobiographies, such as Baby Kamble's The Prisons We Broke (2008) and P. Sivakami's The Grip of Change can be viewed as protest narratives against the exploitation of dalit women by upper caste people, as well as the internal gender hierarchies within dalit families. By establishing dalit women‚Äôs identity as that which is affected by mutual and intersecting structures of caste and gender, dalit women‚Äôs autobiographies reinforce the Dalit feminism as an intersectional category.

Members of the group receive a badge and information about Dalit leaders. DMS began to create dialogues among women in various communities in UP which lead to some women taking on leadership positions. Each village selects two women to represent the local DMS chapter at the cluster level. Clusters are organized to have presidents, treasurers and secretaries who meet once a month.

Background The first train was RegionalExpress number 3612, pulled by √ñBB 1044 235, a scheduled train running from Innsbruck HBF to Munich HBF, which was stopping at Garmisch-Partenkirchen railway station for 10 minutes. The second train was the famous \\"Glass Train\\" (DB Class 491 001), a historical tourist train that was running as a special train on that day on the Mittenwald Line, on the reversed route of the RegioExpress. At Garmisch- Partenkirchen, the 2 trains would cross each other (the line is single-tracked at the entrance from all 4 ends into the railway stations, from the Mittenwald Railway, from the Garmisch Railway, the Aussenfern Railway and the Zugspitze Railway), hence the 10 minute wait of the RE3612, and then they would both depart for their destinations. The 1044 was made from a very robust structure, ensuing that an impact at lower speeds would only do minor damage to the locomotive (such as dents, scratches, etc.). The 491, however, had a very weak structure that was like this because of the panoramic windows. This panoramic experience was at the cost of safety in train crashes. The age of both trains also differed, 1044 235 being completed at the SGP workshops in 1992 and 491 001 having been in service since 1935 (Waggonfabrik Fuchs). Events The guard of the RE train had tucked inside the building of the station to get a cup of coffee. However the station staff had just ran out of coffee, and so he had to wait until the coffee was ready, going through the coffee machine. Whilst he was awaiting, a colleague informed him he had to depart, at the surprise of the guard. The guard then ran back into the train, whistled for departure, and automatically closed the doors. The station signal for the track where the RE train was standing was obstructed, however, by the train and the platform roof. The weather conditions at the time of the accident were light snowfall at temperatures around zero degrees. The driver heard the whistle, and then started accelerating whilst looking back at the train and the station, quickly picking up speed due to the acceleration force of the locomotive. The train driver forgot about the signal, which was indicating a Hp0 (Stop), to allow the Glass Train to arrive into the station. When the RE driver was attempting to get into the position in the drivers' seat, he noticed the other train just a few meters away. Despite applying an emergency brake, the train could not stop, and hit the Glass Train at 47 km/h, whilst the Glass Train itself was going at 37 km/h. Aftermath A person died aboard the Glass Train, and another 27 were injured, due to the flying glass shards from the panoramic windows, and another 14 were injured aboard the RE train. The front end of the Glass Train was crushed to the point that it was pushed back into the train, and the motor bogie was so damaged that it was completely irreparable, meaning that the trainset will not be able to drive ever again, unless a new motor bogie is reconstructed, however at a high unaffordable price. The train was towed back to N√ºrnberg in January 1996, and since 2005 it is stabled at Bahnpark Augsburg. It is stored in the locomotive shed with the destroyed front end being stored in the shed itself. The train will be likely to be not repaired anytime soon, due to the high repair costs. 1144 235, the other locomotive involved in the accident, seen in 2017, still in service The 1044 suffered slight damage and was quickly repaired and put back into service. Since 2002 it was modified into a Class 1144 locomotive, having modernized equipments aboard the train. It still runs as of August 2018. The locomotive driver of the regional express was sentenced to 10 months imprisonment on probation and a fine of 9,000 DM and the guard to a fine of 6,000 DM.

The specific epithet purpurea is Latin for \\"purple\\", referencing the purple spikelets of the grass. Description Triplasis purpurea up grows to in height. Its wiry, tufted culms are either widely spreading or ascending, with pubescent nodes. The leaf sheathes and small, rigid leaves of the grass are scabrous. The ligule is a ring of short hairs. Its terminal panicles are long, with rigid and divergent branches. The rose-purple spikelets of the grass are long with two to five flowers and have rather short pedicels. The flowering scales are oblong and twice lobed at their apex, with glabrous lower scales. The joints of the rachilla are as half as long as the flowering scales. The awn of the lemma barely exceeds its truncate lobes. The grass flowers from August to October. Distribution and habitat Triplasis purpurea is endemic to North America, mostly throughout along eastern coast but also in the midwest. The grass prefers the sandy dunes and beaches of the Atlantic coast, Gulf coast, and the Great Lakes, though it can also occur in disturbed areas inland such as roadsides.

Based in New York City, Peloton's main products include a stationary bicycle and treadmill that allow monthly subscribers to remotely participate in classes that are streamed from the company's fitness studio. Much of the company's popularity stems from its now-celebrity fitness instructors, such as Robin Arzon, Jenn Sherman, Kendall Toole, Ally Love, Alex Toussaint, Cody Rigsby, Ben Alldis, and Jess King.  History  Peloton was founded by Graham Stanton, Hisao Kushi, John Foley, Tom Cortese, and Yony Feng in 2012. In January 2017, William J. Lynch Jr., former CEO of Barnes & Noble, joined Peloton as company President. In May 2018, Peloton announced plans to expand into Canada and the UK in fall 2018. In June 2018, Peloton acquired Neurotic Media, a music distributor. In March 2019, Peloton was sued by the National Music Publishers Association for using copyrighted music in their videos without proper synchronization licenses, seeking $150 million in damages. The action resulted in changes to music used in its sessions, as well as removal of certain programs that used the songs that were specifically named in the suit. Users criticized these changes as affecting the quality of its product experience. In September 2019, the suit was amended and increased to $300 million. In October 2019, Peloton acquired Tonic Fitness Technology, a Taiwanese manufacturing company for $47.4 million. In February 2020, Peloton announced that the competitor Flywheel would cease services at the end of the month, after it had settled with Peloton over a patent lawsuit. Peloton is offering exchanges for Flywheel Home bikes. Peloton was one of the few companies that benefited from the lockdown measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to a May 2020 estimate, its stock price increased by 36%, online searches for \\"Peloton\\" almost tripled since the end of February, and quarterly sales jumped nearly 61% to $420.2 million.  Products  = Bikes = Peloton's first stationary bicycle was released in 2014 at a price of $2,245. In September 2020, Peloton released a new version of the stationary bike, dubbed Bike+. Bike+ features a larger, swiveling screen, auto-follow resistance, more speakers, and Apple GymKit integration. Bike+ costs $2,495 and Peloton reduced the price of the original bike, Bike, to $1,895. All of Peloton's bikes include a touchscreen on which the user may view classes. The product operates on a custom version of Android and is available on Apple TV, Fire TV, Roku TVs and Roku devices, and Android TV, which is installed onto smart TVs from Sony, Phillips, and Sharp. The Peloton app can also be shared from an iOS device using AirPlay or Miracast from your Peloton Bike or Tread, plug an HDMI cable in from your computer, Chromecast from an iOS and Android device, or depending on the brand of TV, classes can be streamed from your TV browser through the web. Bike shoes with cleats are required for use so that the user can lock into the pedals. A version of the bicycle designed for commercial environments was unveiled in January 2017. Many different types of classes besides cycling are available to users including strength, yoga, cardio, meditation, running, stretching, boot camp, barre and walking classes. Additionally, Peloton users can video chat with friends in on-screen classes. Classes are recorded daily and streamed live from Peloton's cycling studio in Chelsea, Manhattan, and are then uploaded to the Peloton library for on-demand access 24/7. The studio was open to the public prior to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic with daily walk-in style classes that do not require payment. = Treadmills = Peloton Tread and Tread+ are the company's treadmill products. Tread+ sells for $4,295, and was unveiled in January 2018 by the company at the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, with initial shipments slated for the fall of 2018. Classes are streamed via a 32‚Ä≥ touchscreen and sound bar mounted at the front of the machine. A lower-end treadmill, Tread, was announced in September 2020 and will retail for $2,495. It is expected to be available in early 2021. = Peloton Digital (app) = Peloton Digital is a monthly subscription service that allows users to stream on iOS and Android devices the company's classes on cycling, running (both treadmill and outdoor), yoga, and meditation. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, Peloton instructors began streaming classes from their individual homes in April 2020, rather than from the Peloton studios. These classes were noted on the app as \\"Live from Home.\\" Funding Before launching its stationary bicycle and fitness platform, Peloton raised $3.9 million in 2012 for product development. In April 2014, Peloton raised a $10.5 million series B round of funding. In April 2015, Peloton raised a $30 million series C round of funding. In December 2015, Peloton raised a $75 million series D round of funding. In May 2017, Peloton raised a $325 million series E round of funding, valuing the company at $1.25 billion. In August 2018, Peloton raised a $550 million series F round of funding, valuing the company at $4 billion. In February 2019, Bloomberg reported Peloton had chosen Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase to lead its initial public offering, valuing the company at more than $8 billion. Peloton Interactive confidentially filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a proposed IPO on June 5, 2019. The company had not yet decided on the number or price range of shares it plans to sell. On September 26, 2019, Peloton raised $1.16 billion via its IPO, floating 40 million shares of class A common stock at $29 per share. At the market close, Peloton's share price had dropped to $25.76 reflecting an 11.2 percent drop on its first day of trading.  Marketing  Peloton launched a major advertising campaign, \\"Better Is in Us\\", during the 2018 Winter Olympics, which aimed to focus on personal stories of its users and how it had affected their lives. The company bought advertising inventory from NBC to air the ads during its coverage of the Games, and also streamed four classes from NBC's Olympics studio in Pyeongchang, South Korea, with instructor Robin Arzon joined by NBC personalities such as Paul Burmeister and Natalie Morales. = The Gift That Gives Back ad controversy = In November 2019, the company released a new holiday commercial, \\"The Gift That Gives Back\\", where a wife receives a Peloton bike for Christmas from her husband, and begins recording a video diary of herself using the bike. A year later, she proclaims that she \\"didn't realize how much this would change me.\\" In late November, the commercial began to receive criticism from viewers who claimed that its plot implied that the woman's husband was dissatisfied with her physical appearance. Peloton defended the ad, arguing that it was intended to celebrate a \\"fitness and wellness journey\\", inspired by how its users were often \\"meaningfully and positively impacted after purchasing or being gifted a Peloton Bike or Tread, often in ways that surprise them.\\" Criticism over the campaign has had an impact on Peloton's share price. Ryan Reynolds hired the actress that played the wife, Monica Ruiz, for an ad titled \\"The Gift The Doesn't Give Back\\" for Aviation American Gin released in December 2019 which lightly mocked the Peloton ad.

The boat made multiple non-intervention patrols during the Spanish Civil War in the late 1930s. During World War II, she played a minor role in the Battle of Kristiansand during the Norwegian Campaign of 1940. Seeadler spent the next couple of years escorting minelayers as they laid minefields and laying minefields herself. She also spent the latter half of 1941 escorting convoys through the Skaggerak. The boat returned to France in 1942 and was one of the escorts for the capital ships sailing from France to Germany through the English Channel in the Channel Dash. Seeadler then helped to escort one commerce raider through the Channel and was sunk by British forces while escorting another blockade runner in May. Design and armament Derived from the World War 1-era large torpedo boat , the Type 23 torpedo boat was slightly larger, but had a similar armament and speed.Gr√∂ner, p. 191 The Type 23 had an overall length of and was long at the waterline. The ships had a beam of , and a mean draft of . They displaced at standard load and at deep load.Whitley 1991, p. 202 The pair of Germania geared steam turbine sets, each driving one propeller, were designed to produce using steam from three water-tube boilers which would propel the ship at .Whitley 2000, p. 57 Seeadler carried a maximum of of fuel oil which was intended to give a range of at . The effective range proved to be only at that speed. Their crew consisted of 4 officers and 116 sailors. As built, the Type 23s mounted three SK L/45 guns, one forward and two aft of the superstructure, numbered one through three from bow to stern. They carried six above-water 50 cm (19.6 in) torpedo tubes in two triple mountsGardiner & Chesneau, p. 237 and could also carry up to 30 mines. After 1931, the torpedo tubes were replaced by tubes and a pair of C/30 anti-aircraft guns were added. During the war another pair of 2 cm guns may have been added before her loss.Whitley 1991, pp. 47, 202; Whitley 2000, p. 57 Construction and career Named after the sea eagle, the boat was laid down at the Reichsmarinewerft Wilhelmshaven (Navy Yard) on 15 July 1926 as yard number 103,Gr√∂ner, p. 192 launched on 15 March 1927 and commissioned on 15 May 1928. By the end of 1936 Seeadler was assigned to the 2nd Torpedo Boat Flotilla and the boat made several deployments to Spain during the Spanish Civil War. The boat ran aground leaving Cadiz harbor on November 1936 and had to be escorted home for repairs by her sister ship . After the heavy cruiser was hit by two bombs from Republican aircraft on 29 May 1937, Adolf Hitler ordered the heavy cruiser to bombard the Republican- held city of Almer√≠a in retaliation. On 31 May the ship did so, accompanied by the four boats of the 2nd Flotilla, targeting Republican coastal artillery, naval building and ships in the harbor, killing nineteen people.Haar 2013, pp. 32‚Äì33 Seeadler and Albatros participated in the bombardment and the former was near-missed by coast-defense guns.Whitley 1991, p. 79 Around June 1938, she was transferred to the newly formed 4th Torpedo Boat Flotilla.Whitley 1991, pp. 77‚Äì79 =Second World War= At the beginning of the war, the 4th Flotilla was disbanded and Seeadler was transferred to the 6th Torpedo Boat Flotilla where she supported the North Sea mining operations that began on 3 September 1939. On 13, 18 and 19 November, the 6th Flotilla and one or two light cruisers met destroyers returning from minelaying missions off the English coast. Two days later the flotilla patrolled the Skagerrak to inspect neutral shipping for contraband goods before returning to port on the 25th. From 14 to 16 December, Seeadler and the torpedo boat made contraband patrols in the Skaggerak, impounding six ships. In retaliation for the Altmark Incident where the Royal Navy seized captured British sailors from the in neutral Norwegian waters on 16 February, the Kriegsmarine organized Operation Nordmark to search for Allied merchant ships in the North Sea as far north as the Shetland Islands. The 2nd Destroyer Flotilla, Seeadler and the torpedo boat escorted the battleships and and the heavy cruiser during the initial stages of the sortie on 18 February before patrolling the Skaggerak until the 20th.Rohwer, pp. 2, 8‚Äì11, 15 During the Invasion of Norway in April 1940, the boat was assigned to Group 4 under Kapit√§n zur See (Captain) Friedrich Rieve on the light cruiser , tasked to capture Kristiansand. They departed Weserm√ºnde on the morning of 8 April and arrived off Kristiansand the following morning, delayed by heavy fog. They had been spotted approaching the city and the alerted coast-defense guns at Odder√∏ya Fortress opened fire on Karlsruhe at 05:32. The cruiser, Seeadler and Luchs returned fire. Neither side inflicted any damage on the other, although several of Karlsruhes shells missed their targets and impacted in the city. With only his forward guns able to bear and his ships loaded with troops, Rieve ordered them to turn away and lay a smoke screen to cover their withdrawal at 05:45. Shortly afterwards, a flight of six Heinkel He 111 bombers from Kampfgeschwader 4 (Bomber Wing) attacked the fortress. Most of their bombs fell outside the fortifications, but one blew up the western ammunition dump and another near the signal station, killing two men and cutting most external communication lines. Encouraged by sight of the blast from the annumition dump and the numerous hits all over the island on which the fortress was built, Rieve ordered his ships to make another try at 05:55, this time at an angle so that all guns could bear. Accuracy for both sides was better this time, but no German ship was damaged and only a couple of shells from Karlsruhe landed inside the fort, wounding several gunners. With no discernable effect on the Norwegian defenses, Rieve was forced to withdraw again at 06:23. He now conceived the idea of bombarding the fortress at long range where he could use plunging fire to attack the guns from above and Karlsruhe would be out of range of the defending guns. The ship opened fire at 06:50 and Rieve ordered Seeadler and Luchs to steam through the narrows, but the fog closed in before they could get there and he had to cancel his order. The cruiser's fire was generally ineffective, with more shells landing in the city, so Rieve withdrew around 07:30 and requested additional air support.Haar 2009, pp. 81, 201‚Äì206 Around that time a British reconnaissance aircraft overflew Kristiansand, but failed to see the German ships off shore. The naval commander of the area queried the supreme command whether British forces should be engaged or not and received the order to let them pass. He passed that order to Odder√∏ya at 08:05. Rieve made another attempt to force the narrows around 09:00 when the fog briefly lifted, but nearly ran Karlsruhe aground and withdrew again. Getting desperate, Rieve ordered his troops loaded onto four of his small E-boats when the fog began to lift again at 09:25 and ordered them to storm the harbor regardless of casualties. An hour later, the Norwegians spotted the incoming German ships with Seeadler and Luchs approaching at high speed, followed by the four E-boats. They were reported at two cruisers and their approach from a different direction caused some observers to think that they were not German, especially since there had been a rumor earlier of British ships spotted in the Skaggerak. The confusion was compounded when observers reported that they were flying the French tricolor flag, confusing it with a Kriegsmarine signal flag of similar color. This caused the Norwegians to think that they were being saved by Allied ships and their guns did not open fire so the Germans landed without resistance and occupied the defenses beginning around 10:45.Haar 2009, pp. 207‚Äì214 Rieve was under orders to return to Kiel as soon as possible, so Karlsruhe sailed at 18:00, escorted by Seeadler, her sister , and Luchs. At 18:58, one torpedo from the British submarine struck the cruiser amidships, knocking out all power, steering and the pumps. Luchs evaded the other nine torpedoes and followed them to their origin and began depth charging the submarine for the next several hours, joined by the other two torpedo boats. Truant was damaged, but survived their attacks. Rieve ordered his crew aboard the torpedo boats and sent Seeadler and Luchs ahead while he remained with Greif to finish off Karlsruhe with a pair of torpedoes. After the heavy cruiser had been crippled by a British submarine off the Danish coast on 11 April, Seeadler, Greif and Luchs, among other ships, arrived the following morning to render assistance.Haar 2009, pp. 377‚Äì379, 382 On 18 April, Seeadler and her sisters , Greif, and the torpedo boat escorted minelayers as they laid anti-submarine minefields in the Kattegat. The boat began a refit at Weserm√ºnde that lasted from May to August after which she was transferred to France. Now assigned to the 5th Flotilla, Seeadler and her sisters, Greif, , and laid a minefield in the English Channel on 30 September ‚Äì 1 October. Reinforced by Wolf and Jaguar, the flotilla made an unsuccessful sortie off the Isle of Wight on 8‚Äì9 October. They made a second, more successful, sortie on 11‚Äì12 October, sinking two Free French submarine chasers and two British trawlers. The 5th Flotilla was transferred to St. Nazaire later that month and its ships laid a minefield off Dover on 3‚Äì4 December and another one in the Channel on 21‚Äì22 December.Rohwer, pp. 20, 43, 45, 51‚Äì52; Whitley 1991, pp. 109, 208 Seeadler, the torpedo boat and the destroyer were the escorts for a minelaying mission at the northern entrance to the Channel on 23‚Äì24 January 1941. The boat was refitted in Rotterdam, Netherlands, from March to May 1941. She was transferred afterwards to the Skagerrak where she was on convoy escort duties. The boat was again refitted in Rotterdam from December 1941 to February 1942 before rejoining the 5th Flotilla. They joined the escort force for Scharnhorst, Gneisenau and the heavy cruiser on 12 February 1942 off Cap Gris-Nez during the Channel Dash. From 12 March to 2 April, the flotilla escorted the commerce raider through the Channel despite heavy British attacks, damaging the British destroyers and .

The Washington State University College of Nursing is a nursing school affiliated with Washington State University. Its main location is on the Washington State University Health Sciences campus in Spokane, Washington, with programs also offered at WSU Vancouver, WSU Tri- Cities, and in Yakima, Washington. Degrees offered include Bachelor of Science in Nursing; RN-BSN; Master of Nursing; Doctor of Nursing Practice; and PhD. Enrollment among all programs at all locations was 942 for spring semester 2018. The college was founded in Spokane in 1968 as the Intercollegiate Center for Nursing Education. The WSU College of Nursing still accepts students from Eastern Washington University and Whitworth University, two of the three original intercollegiate partners.  History  The Spokane League for Nursing and the Inland Empire Nurses' Association formed a joint committee on nursing education in 1964 with the goal of establishing a baccalaureate nursing program in Eastern Washington. Following several years of meetings and consultations, a steering committee proposed an intercollegiate model of nursing education to the presidents and boards of regents of the four colleges and universities interested in the concept: Washington State University in Pullman; Eastern Washington State College in Cheney; and Whitworth College and Fort Wright College, both in Spokane. All four institutions approved the plan, which had students completing pre-nursing studies at their respective colleges then moving on to nursing studies at the Intercollegiate Center for Nursing Education in Spokane. The first class of 37 students was admitted to ICNE in July, 1969. The program was accredited by the National League for Nursing in 1974. ICNE was located in the former Carnegie Library in downtown Spokane when it opened. That space proved inadequate to the program's growth, and Sen. Warren Magnuson, D-Wash., helped obtain federal financing in 1977 to build a new facility to house the nursing program. The Warren G. Magnuson Intercollegiate Nursing Building opened in 1980 on a site across from Spokane Falls Community College, northwest of downtown Spokane. The facility cost $5.76 million. In 1981, ICNE established ICNE Yakima as an extended campus, housed in a small cottage near Yakima Valley Community College. The next year, Fort Wright College closed, ending its participation in the intercollegiate nursing education program. Washington State University opened branch campuses in Vancouver, Washington, and in Richland, Washington, which is part of the Tri-Cities. Nursing programs were offered at both branch campuses. In 2005, the Washington Legislature gave WSU $32 million to build a College of Nursing facility on what was then called the Riverpoint Campus - Now WSU Health Sciences Spokane - in downtown Spokane. The final construction cost was $34.6 million, with the federal government contributing another nearly $2.5 million to fund technology for distance education and simulation. Students began attending classes there in 2009.  Programs  The WSU College of Nursing began offering a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) in 1969. It added the degree-completion program RN-BSN in 1978 and a Master of Nursing (MN) degree program in 1983 to train advanced-practice nurses to provide primary care. The PhD program began in 2007, and the newest degree, the Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP), was added in 2012.

Life Margaret Grey Porter was born Margaret Lavinia Lindsey the eldest daughter of gentleman, Thomas Lindsey, and the daughter of Charles Bingham, 1st Earl of Lucan, Lady Margaret. She had 3 brothers and 4 sisters. She married Reverend John Grey Porter (1789‚Äì1871) in 1816. He was the rector of Kilskeery, County Monaghan from 1814 to 1871. John Grey Porter was the son of the bishop of Clogher, John Porter. There were a very wealthy family, with John Grey Porter donating large amounts of the Church of Ireland. Soon after their marriage, the couple visited Italy. While there, Porter bought samples of Italian appliqu√© work, and upon their return to Kilskeery, she set about studying how to recreate the work with her maid, Ann Steadman. The new lace the women developed garnered interest with its artistic designs. From around 1820 the women taught local women and girls the lace making skill, from patterns they developed. The resulting lace, Carrickmacross lace, was successful with the local women earning extra income through their lace making. When Porter and her husband left the area, the teaching was taken up by two Misses Reid of Rahans, and later Tristram Kennedy. Her husband bought the Belleville estate and Belmore lands in County Fermanagh in 1830. He later bought the Clogher episcopal palace, renamed Clogher Park, in 1850. After her husband's death, Porter lived at Clogher Park until her death in 1881. By the 1870s the Porter family owned 20,000 acres. The Porters had one son, John Grey Vesey Porter, and 6 daughters.

Mulville is a field archaeologist whose research focuses on osteoarchaeology, human and animal identities, and island archaeologies concentrated on Britain.  Education and career  Archaeology was not the initial career choice of Mulville, who undertook a BSc in Biology at Imperial College London. Volunteer work however marked the start of her career in archaeology, and she worked as a field archaeologist for English Heritage on sites including Beeston Castle, and as a Research Assistant for English Heritage at the University of Cambridge examining evidence from Roman and later periods from Chelmsford (Caesaromagus) and Colchester (Camulodonum). She undertook a PhD at the University of Sheffield, under the supervision of Paul Halstead, being awarded a doctorate in 1995 for her thesis 'Milking, Herd Structure, and Bone Chemistry: An Evaluation of Archaeozoological Methods for the Recognition of Dairying'. This analysed the identification of milking, using domestic dairy cattle and St Kilda Soay Sheep as study populations. Mulville then worked for the West Yorkshire Archaeology Service, recording material from West Heslerton, and as a commercial archaeologist at the University of Sheffield, before returning to English Heritage at Birmingham University to analyse a medieval assemblage from Castle Mall Norwich. At Southampton University she was a Research Assistant for English Heritage, examining Saxon and Neolithic sites. Mulville excavated at South Uist in the Outer Hebrides, and was a co- director of excavations at Cladh Hallan. This investigated the only two bodies known to have been mummified among the early tribes of Europe, although Mulville suggested the practice may have been more common than we know, and said that the finds at Cladh Hallan raised more questions than they answered. Mulville became a senior research fellow at the University of Oxford, working sites including Glaston and Fiskerton. After this she taught briefly at University College Winchester before moving in 2002 to Cardiff University where she replaced Professor John Evans on his retirement. She founded Guerilla Archaeology, a Cardiff-based outreach organisation of archaeologists, scientists and artists.  Awards  Mulville is a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, where she gave one of the 2015 Rhind Lectures, on \\"Storytelling\\".

The boat made multiple non-intervention patrols during the Spanish Civil War in the late 1930s. During World War II, she played a minor role in the Norwegian Campaign of 1940 by transporting troops that captured Arendal. Greif spent the next couple of years escorting minelayers as they laid minefields and laying minefields herself. She also spent the latter half of 1941 escorting convoys through the Skagerrak. The boat had a lengthy refit that lasted all of 1942 and then spent March‚ÄìApril 1943 escorting ships in Norwegian waters before returning to France. While deployed there Greif laid numerous minefields and escorted U-boats through the Bay of Biscay. The boat was sunk by Allied aircraft in May 1944. Design and armament Derived from the World War 1-era large torpedo boat , the Type 23 torpedo boat was slightly larger, but had a similar armament and speed.Gr√∂ner, p. 191 The Type 23 had an overall length of and was long at the waterline. The ships had a beam of , and a mean draft of .

The effective range proved to be only at that speed. Their crew consisted of 4 officers and 116 sailors. As built, the Type 23s mounted three SK L/45 guns, one forward and two aft of the superstructure, numbered one through three from bow to stern. They carried six rotating torpedo tubes in two triple mounts amidships and could also carry up to 30 mines.Gardiner & Chesneau, p. 237 After 1931, the torpedo tubes were replaced by tubes and a pair of C/30 anti-aircraft guns were added. At least some of the ships were fitted with depth charges, but details are lacking.Haarr, p. 377 During the war a quadruple 2 cm was added just forward of No. 2 gun, three 2 cm guns were positioned around the aft funnel and another pair were mounted on the bridge wings, all in single mounts.

By the end of 1936 Greif was assigned to the 4th Torpedo Boat Flotilla and the boat made several deployments to Spain during the Spanish Civil War. Around June 1938, she was transferred to the newly formed 5th Torpedo Boat Flotilla.Whitley 1991, pp. 77‚Äì79 =Second World War= Greif was used in the North Sea mining operations that began on 3 September 1939. Together with three destroyers and her sisters and , Greif was tasked with anti-shipping patrols in the Kattegat and Skaggerak from 3 to 5 October that captured four ships.Rohwer, pp. 2, 6 During the Invasion of Norway in April 1940, the boat was assigned to Group 4 under Kapit√§n zur See (Captain) Friedrich Rieve on the light cruiser . Unlike the rest of the group, she was tasked to capture the undefended port of Arendal to capture a telegraph cable to England. Greif was loaded with 90 soldiers from the 163rd Infantry Division and carried the flotilla commander to oversee the operation. After its successful conclusion, she was ordered to rejoin the main force at Kristiansand. The group departed Weserm√ºnde on the morning of 8 April and arrived off Kristiansand and Arendal the following morning, delayed by heavy fog.Haar, pp. 81, 201, 213 The torpedo boat entered Arendal harbor around 08:30 and offloaded her troops peacefully, not noticing the 2.-class torpedo boat which was anchored with her bow towards the land. The boat's captain, L√∏ytnant (Lieutenant) Thore Holthe, was out of contact with his superiors and lacked orders to attack any intruders and did nothing to attract attention because he would have to cast off and turn around in order to fire his torpedoes. Greif did not notice the Norwegian boat and left shortly after 09:00 arriving at Kristiansand around 11:40.Haar, pp. 213, 215‚Äì217 Rieve was under orders to return to Kiel, Germany, as soon as possible, so Karlsruhe sailed at 18:00, escorted by Greif, her sister , and the torpedo boat . At 18:58, one torpedo from the British submarine struck the cruiser amidships, knocking out all power, steering and the pumps. Luchs evaded the other nine torpedoes and followed them to their origin and began depth charging the submarine for the next several hours, joined by the other two torpedo boats. Truant was damaged, but survived their attacks. Rieve ordered his crew aboard the torpedo boats and sent Seeadler and Luchs ahead while he remained with Greif to finish off Karlsruhe with a pair of torpedoes. After the heavy cruiser had been crippled by a British submarine off the Danish coast on 11 April, Seeadler, Greif and Luchs, among other ships, arrived the following morning to render assistance.Haar, pp. 377‚Äì379, 382 On 18 April, Greif and her sisters , Seeadler, and the torpedo boat escorted minelayers as they laid anti-submarine minefields in the Kattegat.

The flotilla escorted other minelaying missions in the same area on 31 August ‚Äì 2 September and 6‚Äì7 September. Reinforced by Wolf, the flotilla made an unsuccessful sortie off the Isle of Wight on 8‚Äì9 October. They made a second, more successful, sortie on 11‚Äì12 October, sinking two Free French submarine chasers and two British trawlers.

On 11 March 1943, Greif and Jaguar were among the escorts for the battleships and Scharnhorst as they moved from Trondheim, Norway, to Bogen Bay, and continued onward to Altafjord with L√ºtzow and the light cruiser from 22 to 24 March. Greif, Jaguar, and the destroyer screened N√ºrnberg from Harstad to Trondheim and then to Kiel between 27 April and 3 May. On 3‚Äì7 May, Greif, M√∂we, and Jaguar escorted minelayers in the North Sea as they laid new minefields. From 4 to 6 June, Greif, M√∂we, Kondor, Falke and the torpedo boat laid two minefields in the English Channel. Later that month the ships returned to the Bay of Biscay to help escort U-boats through the Bay and continue to do so into early August. Greif, Kondor and the torpedo boats , , and laid a minefield in the English Channel on 29‚Äì30 September.Rohwer, pp. 198, 233, 236, 247, 249, 254, 256, 279; Whitley 1991, pp. 164‚Äì165, 208 The 4th and 5th Torpedo Boat Flotillas, consisting Greif, M√∂we, Kondor, Jaguar, T27 and the torpedo boat laid minefields of 180 mines, off Le Havre and F√©camp, France, on 21 and 22 March 1944. On 17‚Äì19 April, the 5th Torpedo Boat Flotilla, including Greif, M√∂we and Kondor sailed from Brest, France, to Cherbourg as distant cover for a convoy. A few days later, the flotilla laid a minefield on the night of 21/22 April. The following night the torpedo boats engaged British motor torpedo boats near Cape Barfleur and sank one of them. On the nights of 26/27 and 27/28 April, they laid 108 mines each night near Cherbourg. On 30 April and 1 May, the flotilla laid 260 mines in three minefields. Three weeks later, the flotilla was ordered to transfer from Cherbourg to Le Havre and departed on the night of 23/24 May. Greif, M√∂we, Falke, Kondor and Jaguar were attacked by Allied aircraft early the next day and Greif was struck by two bombs that set her forward boiler room on fire and caused her to take on water forward. With both boiler rooms subsequently flooded, she was unmaneuverable and accidentally collided with Falke. The latter was only slightly damaged, but Greifs bow was badly bent which caused problems for M√∂we when she began to tow her sister. Around 06:00 Greif lost all power and sank at 06:32.Rohwer, pp. 312, 317‚Äì318, 324; Whitley 1991, p. 158 Notes Citations Bibliography   External links *Type 1923 on www.kbismarck.com *Type 1923 on www.navypedia.org Category:Type 23 torpedo boats Category:1926 ships ","title":"German torpedo boat Greif"},{"id":"58065077","text":"The 2018 Albanian Supercup was the 25th edition of the Albanian Supercup, an annual Albanian football match.

He is best known for his involvement in Operation Tombola. Early Life Eyton-Jones was born on 8 March 1923 in Forest Hill, Kent, England. He is a grandson of the Reverend Hugh Eyton-Jones, a great grandson of Dr Thomas Eyton-Jones, and a great grandson of Sir John Aird, 1st Baronet. He was educated at Monkton Combe School in Somerset. =World War II= In September 1939, when David was 16 years old, he heard Neville Chamberlain's announcement of the declaration of war with Germany in the drawing room of his great aunt Gertrude Aird's mansion, Sheepcote Manor, in Buckinghamshire. She was the daughter of Sir John Aird, 1st Baronet. After the outbreak of World War II David was asked to return to Monkton Combe School to take part in Home Guard duties. Following this in 1940 Eyton-Jones started university at Jesus College, Cambridge, reading Agriculture. Drafting began after five terms and he enrolled in the army at the end of 1942. In April 1944, following basic and officer cadet training in North Wales, David was commissioned into the Royal Sussex Regiment where he commanded 30 infantrymen. In the summer of that year he embarked on a troopship 'The Empress of Scotland' for Italy which was part of a convoy from Gourock, near Glasgow, to Naples via Oran, using an indirect fluctuating route to avoid the danger of German U-boat attacks. The stormy weather reduced the risk from U-boats but resulted in seasickness on board. Some time in Autumn 1944 the convoy reached Oran, where there was significant bomb damage before docking at Naples, which appeared comparatively peaceful. Eyton-Jones was unable to locate his regiment, who had been transferred to Greece and instead chose to volunteer for Special Operations with the 2nd SAS Regiment. Special Air Service =Operation Tombola= The northern part of the Apennine Mountains were targeted by Special Operations Executive, who planned to attack the German forces from behind their lines. The operation, code-named Operation Tombola was led by Major Roy Farran. David was chosen for this mission and undertook two weeks of training. On 7 March 1945 Eyton-Jones and two other SAS troops parachuted behind enemy lines from a Dakota C-47 Skytrain. This night time parachute descent into enemy held territory was his first parachute jump and he faced freezing temperature and mountainous terrain conditions. Farran called for Eyton-Jones and a guardsman called Russel Kershaw enquiring about their experience with snow. Because Eyton-Jones had skied in Switzerland and Kershaw had experience bob-sleighing, they were offered the positions. Farran was to lead an attack on two villas used as German headquarters in Botteghe d'Albinea, in the hills above Reggio Emilia on the night of 27 March. Eyton- Jones and Kershaw were given orders to route an escape for all British soldiers from the Tombola Valley after the attack. The main intention was to avoid 'rastrellamento', meaning 'search and round-up', or being press ganged to work for the Nazis following any attack on the German corps headquarters. Eyton-Jones and Kershaw made a return to their landing site, Case Balocchi locating a guide who took them to Monte Cusna, a mountain range. Unlike the 50 British soldiers, the guide was equipped with skis, sticks and snow goggles, an offer to look for supplies for their unit was refused by Eyton-Jones as he knew they needed too many. It took a day to reach the Rifugio mountain hut. On noticing the door was difficult to open they realised that snow had drifted into the hut through a grate on the eastern wall. The fire had been incapacitated and there were no logs to burn anyway, so they ate self heating tins of soup and laid their sleeping bags on top of the snow pile, keeping their boots on. During the night their sleeping bags melted the snow and they sank into the pit, creating the illusion that they were in graves. They took an amphetamine pharmaceutical called Benzedrine in tablet form. Eyton-Jones suffered Photokeratitis, a temporary blindness caused by sunlight reflecting from the snow. Eyton-Jones and Kershaw concluded that the mountain escape route was too challenging to be functional for the British to use as an escape route. They descended the mountain by sliding on their backsides. Kershaw's bobsleigh experience meant he went first, using his heels to steer between boulders. They reached relatively flat ground and recognised that their feet were black and one of Kershaw's feet had been injured by colliding with a boulder. Official British Army photograph of Italy Detachment 2nd SAS Regiment, 1945. Unable to unfasten their boot laces they walked towards Febbio in order to find Special Operations Executive agent Mike Lees, a member of their team. He had already left and was on his way to the attack at Botteghe d'Albinea in the hills above Reggio Emilia so Eyton-Jones and Kershaw were compelled to walk five miles back to the village of Quara. Frostbite made this walk very painful. It took six months for Eyton-Jones' feet to recover from this ordeal. On meeting with Farran and delivering the news about the inappropriate escape route it was decided that due to Eyton-Jones' bad feet he should be in charge of some jeeps mounted with Vickers machine guns. Air drops had been made to supply weapons for the British, who had joined with a local Italian faction and seventy Russian soldiers, lead by Victor Pirogov, a lieutenant in the Red Army who had escaped from a Prisoner of War camp. Four jeeps were dropped near the village of Quara using large parachutes. One vehicle had become wrapped in the chute while falling and was destroyed, but weapons were provided by further air drops for the British force who linked up with local Italian partisans and the group of escaped Russians. This collective attacked convoys and raided the German 51 Corps Headquarters based at two villas in the Tuscan Apennines. Other duties included blocking roads, and firing upon a number of installations. A couple of days later some US aircraft was seen to have been hit by enemy fire. The crew bailed out and on seeing the parachutes, Eyton-Jones and an Italian Quartermaster known only as 'Barba Nera' (original real name Annibale Alpi), meaning Black Beard, boarded a jeep and drove towards their landing place, rescuing them from a German soldiers in a Volkswagen who were cut off from capturing the Americans by a river. Barba Nera escorted the recovered soldiers to a farmhouse where they stayed hidden with six other crew members who had found the hideout until the end of the war. =Po Valley= In April 1945, Roy Farran called a meeting for all British officers following a radio message from the Special Operations Executive and Allied Forces Advance Headquarters in Florence. It was a directive for continuing assaults to be made on German communication lines to coincide with the spring offensive by the Allies. It was ordered that jeeps and a mountain Howitzer were to be brought down into the foothills overlooking the Po Valley. The assigned commander of the Italian company of 50 partisans wasn't proving popular, so Eyton-Jones was reallocated to take over. In addition a British Corporal assisted, with a Spanish SAS member for interpretation. The target for the Italian Company was instructed to attack German transport on Route 12, a route leading over the mountains between two villages, Pavullo and Monte Fiorino. This was the location of a staging post called Montebonello. Eyton-Jones navigated the Italians to a position less than 5 miles of Route 12 progressing crosscountry towards the main road, avoiding Montebonello. It was overgrown, so the large group of soldiers alerted dogs in some farmhouses. Upon reaching the main road they located undercover for two hours on both sides of the road. No convoys appeared, so the troops fell back and headed towards their transitory HQ before sunrise. It was determined that excessive noise was impossible to avoid with such a large group, so the next night, an SAS veteran called Corporal Ford was instructed to move out a smaller party. Through using an alternative route they saw a column of German vehicles and horse-drawn transport making a northward retreat along Route 12. The unit opened fire with machine guns and rifles, destroying a number of vehicles. Their task complete, the unit withdrew using the fastest route which passed close to Montebonello, where they had been previously fired upon but made a successful escape nevertheless. A daylight reconnaissance was made by Eyton-Jones the following day, towards a hill 800 yards adjacent to Montebonello. Compass bearings were taken on Montebonello church spire where it was suspected there was a German observation post thanks to visible wireless aerials. After dark, machine guns with ammunition belts loaded with tracer, armour piercing, and high explosive rounds were transported on mules to Monteforco where they aimed at the previously registered compass points. The order was given to fire until all ammunition was exhausted. Return fire began as Eyton-Jones and his company disengaged and continued for a mile until sunrise. David gathered the company with those who were left behind and started advancing towards Po valley where the remaining German convoys were observed driving north in retreat. During this German retreat, Eyton-Jones lead a force of 50 partisans in Sassuolo city when some tracked vehicles approached. The first was an American scout car, which Eyton-Jones approached with every gun aimed at him. When questioned in Italian Eyton-Jones responded in English, alerting the American officer the SAS had recovered the area two months ago. During the American advance, Eyton-Jones was required to bury the bodies of three colleagues who lost their lives during the operation (One of these was the basque 2nd SAS Member Justo Balerdi 'Roberto Bruce' killed in action 21 April 1945 on route 12 closed to Torre Maina (Modena) ), as well as disarming some of the Russian troops, still armed after taking part in the SAS operation. These Red Army soldiers had been conscripted by the Nazis when their homeland was invaded, but deserted the German army and resisted them as Partisans. Allied Command's orders, sent from Italy, following instructions directly from Winston Churchill, the Russians were disarmed and made their way from Italy to Russia by train. Many years later, Eyton-Jones was horrified to hear that on their arrival in Russia, they were shot on the orders of Stalin. Following the war, the SAS was disbanded and Eyton-Jones joined the 1st Battalion, the Royal Sussex Regiment as part of the occupying force in Italy. Royal Sussex Regiment In 1947 the regiment boarded the 'City of Canterbury' at Venice heading for Port Said. Following this they departed for the British Mandate in Palestine for a six-month tour of duty, based north of Gaza. During this time there were Jewish terror groups active against British troops, but despite the dangerous, hard work, Eyton-Jones made visits to Jerusalem and Bethlehem. While posted here, his commanding officer from his SAS days, Major Roy Farran was arrested for the murder of a 16 year old Jewish boy. He visited him he was on remand in a prison in Ramallah. He was guarded by troops of the Royal Sussex Regiment. Farran was later acquitted and went back to the UK. After the war At Loxwood near Horsham, David started running a landscape gardening partnership. In 1949 Eyton-Jones married Diana, who he had met after the war. She had served with the Women's Auxiliary Air Force. Following his partner contracting Tuberculosis, David sought new work, finding a contract as an Assistant Manager for a Tea Estate in Assam, India. As there was no telephones or television, all communication was made by telegram. A decline in profits lead to a manager retiring, so at the age of twenty seven David became Manager, administering 750 acres for 11 years. His responsibilities included 750 employees and overseeing the infrastructure of this isolated community. There was a hospital, dispensary, two schools and onsite workers' houses. In 1962 the business was purchased by an Indian company who wished to employ an Indian manager, so David and Diana moved back to the UK. Here, David became employed by the Secretary of the Royal Forestry Society, managing the landscaping of industrial sites for Wealden Woodland, Godalming. Eyton-Jones served as Chaplain of the Chichester Branch of the Royal Sussex Regimental Association during his retirement. Several books have been published after WW2, speaking about the 2nd SAS experience of David Eyton Jones during Operation Tombola. From \\"Winged Dagger\\" (1948) and \\"Operation Tombola\\" (1960) written by Roy Alexander Farran, to \\"Special Operation Executed\\" (1986) of Michaal Lees, then the Italian books \\"Il bracciale di sterline\\" (2011), \\"Il paradiso dei folli\\" (2014), \\"Il suonatore matto- the mad piper\\" (2017) all written by journalist and author Matteo Incerti. The latest one is \\"SAS Italian Job\\" written in 2018 by the English author Damien Lewis. Few weeks before his death, David Eyton Jones gave his last interview with the journalist Matteo Incerti. Eyton-Jones died in his sleep on 1 August 2012.

The boat made multiple non-intervention patrols during the Spanish Civil War in the late 1930s. During World War II, she played a minor role in the attack on Oslo, the capital of Norway, during the Norwegian Campaign of 1940. Kondor spent the next several months escorting minelayers as they laid minefields and damaged heavy ships back to Germany before she was transferred to France around September. She started laying minefields herself that month and continued to do so for the rest of the war. The boat returned to France in 1942 and helped to escort blockade runners, commerce raiders and submarines through the English Channel and the Bay of Biscay. Damaged by a mine shortly before the Allied Invasion of Normandy in June 1944, Kondor was under repair on the day of the landings. Recognizing that she could not be repaired quickly, the boat was decommissioned later that month and was then further damaged by British bombers so that she was declared a constructive total loss. Design and armament Derived from the World War 1-era large torpedo boat , the Type 23 torpedo boat was slightly larger, but had a similar armament and speed.Gr√∂ner, p. 191 The Type 23 had an overall length of and was long at the waterline. The ships had a beam of , and a mean draft of . They displaced at standard load and at deep load.Whitley 1991, p. 202 The pair of Schichau geared steam turbine sets, each driving one propeller, were designed to produce using steam from three water-tube boilers which would propel the ship at .Whitley 2000, p. 57 Kondor carried a maximum of of fuel oil which was intended to give a range of at . The effective range proved to be only at that speed. Their crew consisted of 4 officers and 116 sailors. As built, the Type 23s mounted three SK L/45 guns, one forward and two aft of the superstructure, numbered one through three from bow to stern. They carried six above-water 50 cm (19.6 in) torpedo tubes in two triple mountsGardiner & Chesneau, p. 237 and could also carry up to 30 mines. After 1931, the torpedo tubes were replaced by tubes and a pair of C/30 anti-aircraft guns were added. During the war a quadruple 2 cm was added just forward of No. 2 gun, three 2 cm guns were positioned around the aft funnel and another pair were mounted on the bridge wings, all in single mounts. Around 1944 a FuMB 4 Sumatra radar detector was installed as was radar.Whitley 1991, pp. 47, 202; Whitley 2000, pp. 57‚Äì58 Construction and career Named after the Condor, the boat was laid down at the Reichsmarinewerft Wilhelmshaven (Navy Yard) on 17 November 1925 as yard number 106,Gr√∂ner, p. 192 launched on 22 September 1926 and commissioned on 15 July 1928. The boat was initially assigned to the 4th Torpedo Boat Half Flotilla. By the end of 1936 Kondor was assigned to the 4th Torpedo Boat Flotilla and the boat made several deployments to Spain during the Spanish Civil War.Whitley 1991, pp. 77‚Äì79 =Second World War= Map of operations in the Oslofjord on the night of 8/9 April, showing how far the Germans had progressed at various times as well as their movements Now assigned to the 5th Torpedo Boat Flotilla, Kondor supported the North Sea mining operations that began on 3 September 1939.Rohwer, p. 2 During the Norwegian Campaign, the boat was assigned to Group 5 under Konteradmiral Oskar Kummetz on the heavy cruiser , tasked to capture Oslo. Kondor transported about 100 men of the invasion force and was one of the cruiser's escorts through the Baltic and Kattegat. At 02:30 the small motor minesweepers R17 and R21 and Kondor were detached to occupy the naval base at Karljohansvern, in the town of Horten. Her sister ship, , had become separated from the main body while crippling the Norwegian patrol boat earlier that night and followed Kondors group to Horten. Haar, pp. 83‚Äì84, 121‚Äì123, 128‚Äì129 The German force tasked to occupy Karljohansvern was scheduled to do so at dawn on 9 April, but Kondors captain, Kapit√§nleutnant (Lieutenant) Hans Wilck, commander of the force, decided to assault the harbor directly since the Norwegians had already been alerted. About 140 soldiers were transferred to R17 and R21 and the former ship was in the lead as they steamed through the harbor entrance at 04:35 at high speed, slowly followed by Albatros, while Kondor was transferring her embarked troops to another ship. The minelayer engaged R17 ten minutes later and set her on fire, but not before she unloaded her troops. The minelayer was only able to get a few shots off at R21 before she steamed behind an island in the harbor. About this time, Albatros was approaching the harbor mouth and exchanged fire with Olav Tryggvason without effect. The torpedo boat, with only a single gun able to bear on the minelayer, withdrew behind one of the outer islands and started blindly bombarding the harbor. Albatros withdrew not long after she was hit by a shell around 06:30 and the German troops that had made it ashore bluffed the Norwegians into surrendering at 07:35, but not before Wilck had reloaded his troops and sailed to regain radio communication with the German cruisers to support the attack.Haar, pp. 147‚Äì151 Later that morning, Kondor and Albatros were ordered to land their troops at Son and then Kondor and several minesweepers were able to pass through the Dr√∏bak Sound after the Norwegian coastal defenses had sunk Bl√ºcher while passing through the Sound further up the Oslofjord, and search for Bl√ºchers survivors. During the search, she damaged a propeller on Bl√ºchers wreckage. Later that day, Kondor supported German forces as they occupied Dr√∏bak. The following morning, Albatros and Kondor were engaged by coastal batteries on the island of Bol√¶rne and forced to turn away. After the coast-defense guns broke down, Kondors crew occupied the island. After the heavy cruiser had been crippled by a British submarine off the Danish coast on 11 April, Kondor and her sister , among other ships, arrived later that morning to render assistance.Haar, pp. 144, 153, 156, 163, 380, 382 Escorted by two destroyers, Kondor, M√∂we, and the torpedo boat , minelayers laid a minefield in the Skaggerak on 29‚Äì30 April. En route, the torpedo boat was sunk when she was accidentally rammed by the minelayer Preussen. From 20‚Äì23 June, Kondor was one of the escorts for the badly damaged battleship from Norway to Kiel, Germany. The following month, she helped to escort Scharnhorsts sister, from Trondheim, Norway, to Kiel from 25‚Äì28 July. Now assigned to the 5th Torpedo Boat Flotilla, Kondor, her sister , and the torpedo boats , , and escorted minelayers as they laid a minefield in the southwestern North Sea on 7/8 August. The flotilla escorted another minelaying mission in the same area on 14‚Äì15 August. The following month, Kondor was transferred to the 1st Torpedo Boat Flotilla, with , T2, and . On 6‚Äì7 September they escorted a minelaying mission in the English Channel. Rejoining the 5th Flotilla before the end of the month, Kondor and her sisters, Falke, , and laid a minefield in the English Channel on 30 September ‚Äì 1 October. Reinforced by Wolf and Jaguar, the flotilla made an unsuccessful sortie off the Isle of Wight on 8‚Äì9 October. They made a second, more successful, sortie on 11‚Äì12 October, sinking two Free French submarine chasers and two British trawlers. The 5th Flotilla was transferred to St. Nazaire later that month and its ships laid a minefield off Dover on 3‚Äì4 December.Rohwer, pp. 20, 22, 29, 34‚Äì36, 39, 43, 45, 51; Whitley 1991, pp. 104, 109 Kondor was refitted in Rotterdam, Netherlands, from March to May 1941. She was transferred afterwards to the Skagerrak where she was on convoy escort duties. The boat was again refitted in Rotterdam from November to December.Whitley 1991, p. 208 1941‚Äì1944 The flotilla joined the escort force for Gneisenau, Scharnhorst and the heavy cruiser on 12 February 1942 off Cap Gris-Nez during the Channel Dash. From 12 March to 2 April, the flotilla escorted the commerce raider through the English Channel despite heavy British attacks, damaging the British destroyers and . The flotilla escorted the commerce raider through the English Channel from 12 to 19 May. In heavy fighting on the 13th, British motor torpedo boats (MTBs) sank Seeadler and the torpedo boat while losing one of their own boats. Falke and Kondor and the torpedo boats and escorted the Italian blockade runner, , from Bordeaux through the Bay of Biscay on 29‚Äì30 November. Another Italian blockade runner, Himalaya, escorted by Kondor and the torpedo boats T2, , T22, and T23, failed in her attempt to break through the Bay of Biscay when she was spotted by British aircraft and forced to return by heavy aerial attacks on 9‚Äì11 April. Kondor, Greif, Falke, M√∂we and T22 laid two minefields in the English Channel on 4‚Äì6 June. Later that month the ships returned to the Bay of Biscay to help escort U-boats through the Bay and continued to do so into early August. M√∂we and Kondor helped to lay two minefields in the English Channel on 3‚Äì5 September.

On 17‚Äì19 April 1944, the 5th Torpedo Boat Flotilla, including Kondor, Greif and M√∂we, sailed from Brest, France, to Cherbourg as distant cover for a convoy. A few days later, the flotilla laid a minefield on the night of 21/22 April. The following night the torpedo boats engaged British MTBs near Cape Barfleur and sank one of them. On the nights of 26/27 and 27/28 April, they laid 108 mines each night near Cherbourg. While trying to evade British aerial attacks on the latter night, Kondor struck a British mine, but was only lightly damaged. On 30 April and 1 May, the flotilla laid 260 mines in three minefields. Three weeks later, the flotilla was ordered to transfer from Cherbourg to Le Havre and departed on the night of 23/24 May. Kondor, Greif, Falke, M√∂we and Jaguar were attacked by Allied aircraft early the next day and Greif was struck by two bombs that set her forward boiler room on fire and caused her to take on water forward. With both boiler rooms subsequently flooded, she was unmaneuverable and accidentally collided with Falke. The latter was only slightly damaged, but Greifs bow was badly bent, which caused problems for M√∂we when she began to tow her sister. Around 06:00 Greif lost all power and sank a half hour later. At 07:43 Kondor struck a mine and had to be towed by M√∂we for the remainder of the voyage. Kondor began a lengthy refit in Le Havre, but was cannibalized for spare parts after the Allies landed in Normandy on 6 June. The boat was decommissioned on 28 June and was then declared a total loss after being hit by bombs on 31 July or 2 August.Rohwer, pp. 312, 317‚Äì318, 324, 345; Whitley 1991, p. 158 References Bibliography   External links *Type 1923 on www.kbismarck.com *Type 1923 on www.navypedia.org Category:Type 23 torpedo boats Category:1926 ships ","title":"German torpedo boat Kondor"},{"id":"58065141","text":"Falke was the sixth and last Type 23 torpedo boat built for the German Navy (initially called the Reichsmarine and then renamed as the Kriegsmarine in 1935). The boat made multiple non-intervention patrols during the Spanish Civil War in the late 1930s. During World War II, she played a minor role in the Norwegian Campaign of 1940. Falke spent the next several months escorting minelayers as they laid minefields and damaged heavy ships back to Germany before she was transferred to France around September. She started laying minefields herself that month and continued to do so for the rest of the war. After a refit in early 1941, the boat was transferred to the Skaggerak where she was assigned escort duties. Falke returned to France in 1942 and was one of the escorts for the capital ships sailing from France to Germany through the English Channel in the Channel Dash. She helped to escort blockade runners, commerce raiders and submarines through the Channel and the Bay of Biscay for the next several years. The boat attacked Allied ships during the Invasion of Normandy in June 1944, but was sunk by British bombers that same month. Design and armament Derived from the World War 1-era large torpedo boat , the Type 23 torpedo boat was slightly larger, but had a similar armament and speed.Gr√∂ner, p. 191 The Type 23 had an overall length of and was long at the waterline.

The effective range proved to be only at that speed. Their crew consisted of 4 officers and 116 sailors. As built, the Type 23s mounted three SK L/45 guns, one forward and two aft of the superstructure, numbered one through three from bow to stern. They carried six above-water 50 cm (19.6 in) torpedo tubes in two triple mountsGardiner & Chesneau, p. 237 and could also carry up to 30 mines. After 1931, the torpedo tubes were replaced by tubes and a pair of C/30 anti-aircraft guns were added. During the war a quadruple 2 cm was added just forward of No. 2 gun, three 2 cm guns were positioned around the aft funnel and another pair were mounted on the bridge wings, all in single mounts. Around 1944 a FuMB 4 Sumatra radar detector was installed as was radar.Whitley 1991, pp. 47, 202; Whitley 2000, pp. 57‚Äì58 Construction and career Named after the Falcon, the boat was laid down at the Reichsmarinewerft Wilhelmshaven (Navy Yard) on 17 November 1925. as yard number 106,Gr√∂ner, p. 192 launched on 29 September 1926 and commissioned on 15 July 1928.

Falke escorted another such mission on 3‚Äì4 February, together with the 1st and 2nd Torpedo Boat Flotillas. The boat was refitted in Rotterdam, Netherlands, from March to May 1941. She was transferred afterwards to the Skagerrak where she was on convoy escort duties until January 1942 when she rejoined the 5th Flotilla in the West. The flotilla joined the escort force for Scharnhorst, Gneisenau and the heavy cruiser on 12 February 1942 off Cap Gris-Nez during the Channel Dash. From 12 March to 2 April, the flotilla escorted the commerce raider through the Channel despite heavy British attacks, damaging the British destroyers and .

She was the captain of the KR team that won back-to-back national championships in 2001 and 2002. In 2001 she was named the Icelandic Women's Basketball Player of the Year and the √örvalsdeild Domestic Player of the Year. Playing career Krist√≠n started playing basketball at the age of 14 with the junior teams of Tindast√≥ll. She joined KR at the age of 17 and soon started playing with its senior team in the Icelandic top-tier league. She helped KR to its first major title in 12 years when it won the Icelandic Cup on 6 February 1999. Two months later, she won her first national championship after KR went undefeated through the regular season and playoffs. Krist√≠n was named the captain of KR prior to the 2000-01 season and led the team to four out of the five major trophies of the season. In December she led all scorers with 18 points in KR's victory against Keflav√≠k in the Icelandic Company Cup finals. In February, she helped KR to its eighth Icelandic Cup by scoring 18 points in a 76-58 victory against Keflav√≠k. In the √örvalsdeild, KR posted the best record for the third straight season and advanced to the √örvalsdeild finals where they faced Keflav√≠k once again. On 1 April 2001, KR completed a sweep of Keflav√≠k, 3-0, in the finals and secured its 12th national championship. After the season she was named the √örvalsdeild Domestic Player of the Year and to the √örvalsdeild Domestic All-First Team. In December 2001, she was named the Icelandic Women's Basketball Player of the Year by the Icelandic Basketball Federation. In April 2002, Krist√≠n helped KR overcome a 0-2 deficit against √çS in the √örvalsdeild finals to win the national championship for the second year in a row. The following season, Krist√≠n moved to the United States for study but managed to appeared in one game, the Company Cup finals on December 21, 2002. She last appeared in 7 games during the first half of the 2008-2009 season, including one Cup game with KR-b. National team career Krist√≠n played 25 games for the Icelandic national basketball team from 1995 to 2002. 2001 drug case controversy In 2001, Krist√≠n failed a drug test by the National Olympic and Sports Association of Iceland (√çS√ç) after using a prescribed medication to treat exercise-induced asthma. The rules regarding the drug in question stated that athletes using it must submit a written statement from a doctor stating that they required the drug, as it could be used for performance enhancement in cold conditions, mainly in outdoor winter sports. The rules however did not stipulate that the statement had to be submitted before the drug test. She submitted the statement during the trial, and as there was no doubt she indeed suffered from asthma and required the drug, the drug court of √çS√ç cleared her of all charges on 2 May 2001. The head of the √çS√ç board of health, Birgir Gu√∞j√≥nsson, was highly criticised for his actions in the case. The Icelandic Basketball Federation claimed that he offered to minimize punishment for two male basketball player who were charged and later suspended for the use of effedrin, an offer he had no legal grounds to make, if Krist√≠n would admit to a wrongdoing. The claim was backed up by another member of the board of health who was present during the meeting. He was further criticised for not disclosing an email from Francoise Jascinski of FIBA that stated that if Krist√≠n had prescriptions from a doctor for using the drug in question, which she did, then there was therapeutical justification for its use and no sanctions should apply for her per FIBA regulations. He was further criticized by the members of the court for his writings following the trial, that suggested the verdict was influenced by Ellert Schram, the chairman of √çS√ç, and others. In July 2001, Birgir resigned as the chairman of the board. Personal life Krist√≠n is the daughter of two-time Icelandic Basketball Player of the Year and former KR player J√≥n Sigur√∞sson and multi-sport athlete Katr√≠n Axelsd√≥ttir.

Birker√∏d Church is particularly noted for its Gothic frescoes (kalkmalerier). History The church dates from the 12th century but has later undergone numerous changes. The nave and chancel of Birker√∏d Church were built in stone in the middle of the 12th century. A north chapel built in mixed field stone and brick was added in the beginning of the 13th century. The remains of it can still be seen in the wall between the sacristy and north chapel. The nave was at this point also lengthened westwards to its current length. Construction of the tower began in circa 1475. A new chancel also replaced the old one at this point. The porch was built around 1525 and the current north chapel was built in 1563. The windows has been moved and altered several times but remains of the original 12th-century windows can still be seen. Furnishings The altarpiece dates from the late 15th century and was probably imported from North Germany. It was restored in 1899 and reinstalled in the church as a replacement for a later altarpiece painted by Gustav Theodor Wegener (1817‚Äì1877) which can now be seen in the north chapel. The pulpit is from circa 1600 and features King Christian IV's monogram. The five arched niches feature Christ and the four apostles. The font is made of sandstone and was created in 1944 by sculptor Axel Poulsen (1887‚Äì1972).Birker√∏d Church altar On the wall to the west of the pulpit is a painting of Henrik Gerner (1629-1700) who was parish priest of Birker√∏d in 1657-85. In 1659, he was arrested for plotting against the Swedish occupants at Kronborg Castle. He returned to Birker√∏d and later became bishop of the Diocese of Viborg. The painting is a copy from 1826 of the original by Flemish painter Karl van Mander (1548‚Äì1606) in the Museum of National History at Frederiksborg Castle.

It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  =1842-1893: Land grant & pastoral use= The subject land was part of an 1842 grant to Thomas Winder, bought in 1884 by Albert Simpson. Exploration for coal in the area around Newcastle was underway in the 1840s. Commercial mining in the Maitland district began at Greta Coalfield in the 1860s, then at East Greta in 1869, with a second mine here in 1898. Other mines were then opened in the vicinity. =East Greta Colliery Railway & creation of East Greta Junction= The original East Greta Coal Mining Co. was established in 1891. One of its first actions was to build a railway from East Greta No. 1 Colliery to the Great Northern Railway. The railway line between the colliery and the government main line was opened in 1893 and was worked by New South Wales Government Railways. Initially East Greta Junction only consisted of a plain junction with the government Great Northern Railway. In 1896 after the take over of haulage on the line by the East Greta Coal Mining Co. using their own locomotive East Greta Colliery Sidings were constructed adjacent to the junction with the government main line. These sidings consisted of 4 loop sidings. However the extension of the private railway system meant that these were soon inadequate, and more loop sidings had been constructed by 1903.Dallas, 2000 By 1910 further storage sidings were required and 4 additional separate loop sidings were constructed on the Cessnock side of the Junction Street level crossing. These sidings were known as Mt Dee sidings and were used for the storage of full wagons, the existing sidings become the empty sidings. In 1901 a branch line from East Greta No.1 Colliery to Stanford Merthyr Colliery was opened. In 1904 a line to Cessnock that branched off the Stanford Merthyr line at Aberdare Junction was opened. Passengers and goods, as well as coal, were transported on the line between Stanford Merthyr and East Greta Junction, in order to connect the colliery communities with Maitland. This service began in 1902, and at first passengers had to make their own way between the junction and West Maitland (later Maitland). In 1903 the service was extended to West Maitland. South Maitland Railways ceased operating the passenger trains in 1967, and the New South Wales Government Railways ceased operation of trains on the line in 1972. =Creation of separate Railway Workshops= Preserved SMR 10 class No.10 in front of the 1981 vintage loco shed at East Greta Junction, the sand shed is on the left. Construction of workshops on the site began in about 1904, when a locomotive depot was built by the East Greta Coal Mining Company. This was a two road engine shed, and was replaced in 1912SMR drawing B5-6-384 Plan of Locomotive Shed East Greta Junction dated 01-03-1912 by a wooden framed twin gable four track galvanised iron shed constructed nearby. In 1981 this was in turn demolished to make way for a modern steel portal framed locomotive shed of slightly shorter length than the original timber shed. The present workshop was constructed some time between 1912 and 1918. Preserved SMR No.10 on display in front of the main workshop building at East Greta Junction in 1991. The change room, toilet block and machine shop buildings are in the background. On the site by 1918 were also a sand drying shed, a signing-on cabin and a wooden coaling platform. An elevated coal loader fed via conveyor was built in 1927. Goods sheds from Caledonia and Weston Stations were moved to the site in 1930 to serve as an oil store and a lunch room. A brick bath house was built in 1943. In 1957 a toilet block, a machine shop and stores building, and a new signing-on cabin were built. The old battery store was demolished. In 1981 a new sand house and battery shed were built. The original Mount Dee homestead on top of the hill became offices, and the first new building was the large Erecting & Repair Workshop. As operations expanded in the 1920s most of the infrastructure was established, with brick buildings added in the 1950s and the last replacement steel framed Running Shed built in 1981. =Formation of South Maitland Railways Ltd= In 1918 the main line railway interests of Hebburn Ltd and the East Greta Coal Mining Co. were merged to form South Maitland Railways Ltd. This new company took over the ownership and operation of the Stanford Merthyr line and the Aberdare Railway, as well as all of the locomotives and passenger and goods rolling stock of the East Greta Coal Mining Co. The new company also took over the haulage over other colliery lines that were previously worked by the East Greta Co. The new company also took over the railway related workshops & facilities at East Greta Junction. After the formation of South Maitland Railways all repair work on the locomotives and rolling stock owned by the company were transferred to East Greta Junction Workshops, previously work had been carried out the East Greta Coal Mining Company's general workshops at East Greta No.1 Colliery. =1967 Ownership change; 1987 closure; 1989+ adaptive reuse for education, heavy industry= In April 1931 the East Greta Coal Mining Co. was taken over by J & A Brown and Abermain Seaham Collieries Ltd, which gave them a 50% share of SMR. In the 1940s due to changes in company laws South Maitland Railways Ltd was changed to South Maitland Railways Proprietary Limited. With the merger of JABAS with Caledonian Collieries Ltd in 1960 and the formation of Coal & Allied Industries Ltd (C&A;) the 50% share in SMR held by JABAS passed to this new company. In 1967 Coal & Allied purchased Hebburn Ltd which then gave them 100% control of South Maitland Railways. The SMR continued as a subsidiary of Coal & Allied until 1989 when SMR Pty Ltd was bought by a private consortium.Maitland Mercury 7 April 1989 Full-time work by South Maitland Railways staff at the workshops ended with the ending of steam haulage on the South Maitland Railway on 10 June 1983. The Workshops remained in limited use maintaining the remaining operational ten class steam locomotives until 1987 when the Coal & Allied owned Richmond Vale Railway closed in September 1987. In 1989 the Hunter Valley Training Co. bought the site and reopened the workshops as an apprentice training centre after rehabilitation. By 1990 the subject site was leased to GEC Alstom Australia P/L. The present complex was opened in 1991 and since the site has been used for heavy industry. In 2015 three workshop buildings were leased to the Maitland Rail Museum for museum use. Discussion is underway over a fourth: the former Blacksmith's Shop being leased by the Maitland Rail Museum also.  Heritage listing  South Maitland Railway Workshops is one of the oldest continually operating railway workshops in Australia, documenting more than 70 years (in 1990) of the history, expansion and development of a steam railway; The South Maitland Railway complex remains largely intact and its extant layout, structures and fabric demonstrate the operation of a steam railway workshops; As the largest private railway workshops in NSW, the South Maitland Railway complex symbolises the importance of coal mining and steam powered transportation both locally and nationally .Summary Statement of Significance, Godden Mackay 1990, p.54 South Maitland Railway Workshops was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

Coastal reservoir is a type of reservoir to store fresh water on sea coast area near a river delta. Saemanguem in South Korea, Marina Barrage in Singapore, Qingcaosha in China and Plover Cove in Hongkong, Delta Works in Netherlands, Thanneermukkom Bund in India etc. are a few existing coastal reservoirs. Advantages Unlike land based water reservoirs there is no land submergence in case of coastal reservoirs. They store water without disturbing people and natural habitat by replacing standing salt water on the sea area by river flood water. The coastal reservoir area is separated from the sea by building earth dikes by dredging. Water is pumped from these reservoirs for irrigation, municipal and industrial purposes. Some times used for flood control and land reclamation from the sea coast. The social and environmental impacts of coastal reservoirs are negligible compared to land based water reservoirs. The construction cost is few times less than the cost of land based reservoirs since there is no expenditure for acquiring the vast land area, the submerged immovable properties and the rehabilitation of displaced people. The sea side of the coastal reservoir can also be used for locating deep sea harbor. Construction Map of proposed Kalpasar Project coastal reservoir in India The coastal reservoirs earth dikes extending up to 8 m msl high, is in the form of two parallel dikes separated by 1000 meters gap. The main purpose of the twin dikes is to prevent any sea water seepage into coastal reservoir as its water level is below the sea water level. The water level between the dikes is always maintained up to 1 m above the sea level by pumping fresh water from the coastal reservoir to the 1000 m gap between the dikes. The higher level fresh water barrier between the two dikes fully eliminate any sea water seepage in to the coastal reservoir by establishing fresh water seepage to the sea. The rain water falling on the coastal reservoir area and the run off water from the catchment area of its minor coastal rivers is adequate to cater the seepage and evaporation losses from the coastal reservoir. The 1000 m gap between the two dikes is also used as deep water mega harbor for shipping, ship breaking, ship building, safe berthing of crude oil, LPG, LNG, etc. ships with floating storage options, etc. For shipping purpose, the breakwater outer dike facing the sea is envisaged with few locks fitted with twin gates for access to the open sea. The top surface of inner dike would serve as access to the main land from the mega harbor with rail and road links. The coastal reservoir whose full reservoir water level (FRL) is at 0.0 m msl, would also drastically reduce the cyclone damage and flooding in coastal areas. It would also greatly improve the irrigated coastal lands drainage. The dikes of coastal reservoirs would also reclaim coastal lands by giving protection from tsunamis, storm surges and tidal bores. The coastal reservoir area can also be used for locating floating solar power plants to generate the needed water pumping power. Also top surface of the inner dike of the coastal reservoirs can be used as transnational highways & railways. Coastal reservoirs are truly multi purpose infrastructure projects with shipping & transport, land reclamation, irrigation, renewable power generation, etc. facilities. The dikes are built by dredging sand and clay from the nearby shallow sea bed using dredgers fueled by LNG or Hydrogen fuel cells or battery power to reduce the construction cost. Major river's water would be diverted in controlled manner to the coastal reservoirs from their delta channels or by flood flow canals by constructing barrages across the major rivers. Their excessive flood flows are directly routed to the sea. The coastal reservoirs located on either side of a major river course/path are interconnected by submarine ducts/pipes of suitable length. Wherever existing ports/waterways and famous beach resorts are to be preserved, the long coastal reservoir is broken in to parts and interconnected by submarine ducts of suitable length. During lean flow periods, minimum environmental flows would be maintained in medium and major rivers up to sea by letting water to the sea directly or via submarine ducts of suitable length. It would also prevent deterioration of water quality in coastal reservoirs by preventing inflow of inferior quality river waters with higher salt load. For inland shipping, the deep water ports (1000 m wide) would be connected with locks arrangement to the major rivers via delta channels and to the adjacent coastal reservoir. Fish migration to and fro to the sea or rivers is possible as the rivers are not completely blocked. Navigation paths from sea to the river via deep sea port will also serve as fish migration routs. However the negative aspects of these man made lagoons are to be evaluated in detail and proper remedial steps shall be incorporated to minimize the damage to coastal ecosystem by the presence of fresh water lagoon as barrier to the sea. Proposed projects There are vast deserts in all continents (western part of South America, northern and south western Africa, middle east in Asia, south eastern part of USA, Australia, etc.) and also water surplus regions nearer to these deserts. It is technically and economically feasible to construct man made fresh water coastal reservoirs / lagoons on the continental shelf of the sea up to 20 meters depth from the coast line to supply fresh water to desert areas from nearby water surplus/high rainfall areas. Excess water from the high rainfall regions will be collected in the coastal reservoirs at sea level and this fresh water is pumped to irrigate desert lands from the other end of the lengthy coastal reservoirs. In other words, the proposal is interconnecting rivers with a sea level / sub sea level contour canal (at least five km wide) to facilitate water transfer. The following are the proposed projects: * The Reber plan involved damming the San Francisco Bay near the Golden Gate, in order to transform the San Francisco Bay into a giant freshwater reservoir that could used to provide potable water and irrigation for the entire state of California. * Hangzhou Bay area in south eastern China can be used for coastal reservoir to store flood water of Yangtze River for the needs of agriculture, city water supply, etc. in entire China. * Water transfer from the west central Africa (Congo River basin, etc.) to Northern Africa (Sahara desert) and South West Africa (Namibia and South Africa deserts) * Water transfer from the south east Africa (Zambezi River basin, etc.) to North east Africa (Somalia, Ethiopia, Sudan, Egypt, etc.). * Water transfer from the northern part of South America continent from Venezuela, Colombia and Panama to desert lands of Chile and Peru by interconnecting Atrato and Tuira rivers to lift/transfer water from the side of Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. * Water transfer from Fly, Kikori, Purari, etc. rivers of the Papua New Guinea island to Northern Australia by blocking the shallow depth sea of Torres Strait between southern Papua New Guinea and Northern tip of Australia. For navigation purpose, a fresh water sea level navigation channel (20 m water depth and 500 m wide) is provided with locks at the entry to the sea to cross the coastal reservoir which is blocking the Torres Strait. The divided coastal reservoir into two parts is connected by underpass water tunnels for water transport. * Water transfer from the north and south coastal areas of western 'North America continent' to south western region of the United States and central parts of Mexico. * East to west Water transfer from a coastal reservoir on Bay of Bengal sea to water deficit parts of India from Ganga and Bramhaputra flood waters. (For more details, refer to the reference available in the 1 April 2019 revision of this Page) * Water transfer from Andhra Pradesh state in India from Krishna and Godavari rivers flood waters to Tamil Nadu state in India with a coastal reservoir on Bay of Bengal sea. (For more details, refer to the reference available in the 1 April 2019 revision of this Page) * Water transfer from India and Sri Lanka to Pakistan and Iran with lengthy coastal reservoir on Arabian sea along the west coast of India from Rameshwaram to Strait of Hormuz. The above gigantic coastal reservoir projects would cover most of the desert areas of the world except the high lands of central Asian deserts. Water needs of these areas can be fully met by diverting water of Siberian rivers. Thus most of the lands which are not available for cultivation and forestry can be turned in to habitat to copious greenery which would help to mitigate the global warming process. With the advent of cheap renewable energy like solar and wind power, availability of energy sources is not a ongoing issue but water availability is still a major issue which can be solved by coastal reservoirs to a major extent.

It was designed by John Verge and built from 1840 to 1842. It is also known as Aberglasslyn and Aberglasslyn Homestead. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  On 3 July 1823 Henry D. Owens received a crown grant of 1100 acres in the Parish of Gosford. In 1824 Owen built a cedar and bluegum cottage on the property. In 1828 the estate and uncompleted house nearly 90 feet long was sold to Sir John Jameison. During the next eight years the estate was let to John Dow and during his occupation the name \\"Aberglasslyn\\" appeared. The property was also let to George Fletcher. In 1835 George Hobler leased Aberglasslyn for a year from Sir John Jameison with an option to purchase. In July 1836 the land was purchased by George Hobler for 5,000 pounds. The same year the architect Henry Robertson advertised for tenders for building a house on the estate. Construction did not commence until 1840 when Hobler recorded in his diary laying the foundation stone. It appears that during the delay Robertson was replaced as architect by John Verge. So closely does the house resemble Verge's work in its planning and detailing that it is accepted that it is the work of the premier architect, John Verge. Before Hobler could finish the house, he had fallen prey, as so many of his contemporaries had, to the financial depression of the early 1840s which devastated the colony. Hobler stopped work on the house in 1842, filed his \\"Insolvent Schedule\\" and was declared bankrupt. Hobler had completed the entrance hall, stair hall, drawing room and breakfast room. The rest of the house was left unfinished. Hobler stayed on until 1845 although the estate was sold in 1843. In 1846 William Nicholson leased the estate and he bought it in 1853. He made the remainder of the house habitable at this time. This work appears to have been completed by 1858 when the house was leased to Walter Hall and his sisters as a boarding school. It continued in the Nicholson family until 1910, then passed through marriage to the McKeachie family. In 1966 the McKeachie family sold the house, by then deteriorated, to Mr Jackson, a local plumber. In 1977 Jackson subdivided the land into four lots. The house and two of the lots were sold to Mr and Mrs Phillip Jones who undertook urgent and major conservation work. Since 1983 the property has been under various ownerships.Lucas 1985  Description  This is an incomplete two storey early Victorian house overlooking a bend in the Hunter River. It is built of finely worked Ravensfield sandstone with a slate roof. It is a large rectangular house, drawing in plan from the compact form of the late 18th and early 19th century English neo-classical villas, with well proportioned rooms arranged around a central square hall containing a geometric staircase describing a circular wall beneath a hemispherical dome. Because of the disastrous financial depression of the early 1840s the house was not finished to the original plan - planned rear single storey wings containing offices were not built and only part of the interior detailing was completed. In the late 1850s most of the unfinished detailing was made good in a simple manner with mitered, moulded architraves instead of the elaborate aedicular forms of the original work. At this time two storied verandahs of cast iron columns on sandstone plinths were built instead of the single storey colonnade originally planned, for which sandstone columns had been quarried and moulded. The workmanship of the first build and the materials used - in particular the Ravensfield stone and the cedar - are of the highest quality. The house retains in its wallpapers and paint finished, together with its services (bells, water closet and ballroom) remarkable evidence of both building, the effect of the financial depression and the taste of its builders. Aberglasslyn is intimately sited close to the Hunter River. It commands extensive pastoral views and is a dramatic European monument set in isolation in an Antipodean landscape. It was reported to be in good condition at the time of its heritage listing, with the property having medium archaeological potential.  Heritage listing  It is arguably the finest extant Greek Revival style villa (in the 18th century sense of the word) in Australia. The configuration of its fabric, largely in its form, is patent physical evidence of the high expectations of colonial settlers of the 1830s and early 1840s and the severity of the economic crash of the 1840s. It is the earliest known surviving example in Australia of a house design generated in part by considerations of an integrated sanitary plumbing system. The building is one of a group of surviving pre-1850 in the vicinity of Maitland. The house and setting is physical evidence of the pattern of land settlement and leasehold farming in the Maitland area. It contains elements of high individual and often unique quality, including a domed stairwell and geometric stair of unique quality and design in Australia. The place is perceived by many knowledgeable people to be one of the major sites of cultural significance in Australia. On a regional basis the building is an historic landmark (monument). It is an exemplary example of the 19th century builder's art embodied in the quality of the stonework, brickwork, timber selection, carpentry and joinery, plasterwork, hardware etc.(Clive Lucas & Partners 1985:32-33). Aberglasslyn was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.

It contains elements of high individual and often unique quality, including a domed stairwell and geometric stair of unique quality and design in Australia. It is one of a handful of pre 1850s villas in Australia designed integrally with a terrace wall, designed for a single-storey colonnade and to be planned around a central staircase in the Palladian manner of Taylor and Soane. The surrounding landscape is the setting for a building of great cultural significance.Clive Lucas & Partners 1985:32-33 The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The place is perceived by many knowledgeable people to be one of the major sites of cultural significance in Australia. On a regional basis the building is an historic landmark (monument). The place has provided and has potential to continue to provide an educational function.Clive Lucas & Partners 1985:33 The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. It is an exemplary example of the 19th century builder's art embodied in the quality of the stonework, brickwork, timber selection, carpentry and joinery, plasterwork, hardware etc. The construction of the stone geometric staircase is unique in Australia. The design and construction of the surviving section of the sanitary plumbing system is unique in Australia. The building is one of the best examples of the use of Ravensfield stone. The present incomplete state of the building provides a rare opportunity for the study of superior quality 19th century building techniques. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. It is the earliest known surviving example in Australia of a house design generated in part by considerations of an integrated sanitary plumbing system.

An appraised value limitation is an agreement between a taxpayer and a Texas school district in which the taxpayer proposes to build or install property--and create jobs meeting certain job and wage requirements--in exchange for a ten-year limitation on the taxpayer's property value for school district maintenance and operations tax (M&O;) purposes. For ten years, school M&O; property taxes are not levied on the value in excess of the limitation amount. Limitation amounts are established by statute and vary by school district from $10 million to $100 million. Unlike abatements based on a percentage of the property value, the structure of the program benefits primarily extremely large projects. The majority of projects are in the petrochemical or energy sectors, although some are typical manufacturing. Created by the Texas legislature in 2001, and initially set to expire in 2007, the program has been renewed several times. In 2013, the Texas Legislature reset the expiration date of the program to December 31, 2022.Texas Legislature, 83rd Regular Session, House Bill 3390 Companies seeking a limitation submit an abatement application to the school district in which the project may be located. The school district forwards the application to the Texas Comptroller for evaluation. The school district may not grant final approval of the abatement without Comptroller analysis and approval. For the 10 years of the tax benefit period, reduced local school district revenues are substantially replaced with state funds through the state public school finance system. The Texas Tax Code gives to the Texas Comptroller's office responsibility and authority to adopt rules necessary for the implementation and administration or the program.Texas Tax Code ¬ß313.031(1) The Comptroller's office delegates to school districts the responsibility to enforce provisions of the limitation agreements.Texas Administrative Code, Title 34, Part 1, Chapter 9, Subchapter F, Rule ¬ß9.1054(i)(3) In 2013, in House Bill 3390, the Texas legislature charged the Comptroller's office with reviewing the number of qualifying jobs created in future projects receiving tax limitations. The Texas Comptroller's website posts documents related to the projects.  Program Costs  A 2019 report to the Texas Legislature by the Texas Comptroller reported 389 active limitation agreements, representing an estimated $183 billion of total investment through 2039. That report indicated that for project agreements between 2004 and 2018, local school property tax revenue reductions due to limitation agreements were approximately $9.7 billion. A \\"Tax Exemptions and Tax Incidence Report\\" prepared by the Texas Comptroller in November, 2018, estimated that limitation agreements would reduce school districts revenues in 2019 by approximately $585 million, also indicating that total school district revenue could be reduced by $944 million in 2022, and $1.1 billion in 2024.  Program Supporters  Supporters of the program argue that Texas' high local property tax rates put the state at a disadvantage when competing for businesses making new investments. Business groups say tax abatements are largely responsible for the \\"Texas Miracle,\\" attracting projects that would have not come to Texas otherwise. Without the 313 program, they say, Texas cannot compete with other states for new business investment. Proponents of the program claim that local school district property revenue reductions created by the abatement do not create a real cost to the state, arguing that \\"but for\\" the program, none of the companies applying for the abatement would have located in Texas. Supporters further point out that the Chapter 313 program is extremely transparent, and that even with Chapter 313 agreements, schools' tax bases are increased.  Program Critics  Critics of the program argue that many of the projects receiving the abatement would have located in Texas for other reasons. Two large LNG projects are being built in Texas even after being refused Chapter 313 abatements by the local school district. Wind farms, they say, find Texas an ideal location due to its rich wind resources, separate electrical grid, and large rate-payer-funded transmission networks. They say that the program's petrochemical projects locate in Texas largely because of little regulation, proximity to rich oil and gas shale plays, and access to deep-water ports and pipeline networks. Critics also point to the relatively small number of jobs created compared to the large amount of revenues forgone for each job. Alt URL They further claim program benefits are too generous, as many companies typically agree to return about 40 percent of the initial tax savings to the local school district through \\"payments in lieu of taxes\\" outside the regular system of school finance. Program critics also argue the statute's requirement that the tax abatement be \\"a determining factor in the applicant's decision to invest capital and construct [a] project in Texas\\" is not the rigorous \\"but for\\" test legislative sponsors promised when the Chapter 313 program was revised and renewed in 2013 by the Texas legislature. The Senate sponsor of the 2013 legislation, Robert Deuell, said at the time, \\"We...have 'but for' provisions meaning that we really have to make sure that these projects would not have come to the state otherwise...\\" Texas House of Representatives bill sponsor Harvey Hilderbran explained, \\"If they [companies] were going to come here anyway, they wouldn't get it.\\" But critics note that the Comptroller's office routinely approves projects after the applicant simply asserts that the project is not 'financially feasible' without the abatement.Texas Tax Code 313.026(c)(2)  Program Studies and Analyses  In 2010, the Comptrollers office studied the program, making recommendations. The Texas Legislative Budget Board in its Texas State Government Effectiveness and Efficiency: Selected Issues and Recommendations (January 2011) analyzed the Chapter 313 program, making recommendations. In 2013, the Chapter was amended to require the Texas State Auditor's Office (SAO) to review at least three major limitation agreements annually.Texas Tax Code ¬ß313.010 The SAO has published reports for 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018. In November, 2016, the Texas Senate Committee on Natural Resources and Economic Development issued an Interim Report to the 85th Legislature critical of the Chapter 313 program. The Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts started issuing biennially reports on limitation economic development projects in 2008. In 2017, University of Texas political science professor Nathan M. Jensen released a study on the Chapter 313 program suggesting that 85 percent of the companies receiving the abatement would have located in Texas for other reasons.  2019 Legislation  During the Texas 86th Legislature (2019), state representative Jim Murphy (Houston) filed House Bill 2129 to extend the expiration of the Chapter 313 program from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2032. The Texas Legislative Budget Board estimated the local school district revenue losses to be approximately $10 billion between 2023 and the year 2049. In a March 20th House Ways and Means committee hearing, representatives of about 50 companies and 40 economic development groups testified or registered for the bill. Five witnesses testified or registered against the bill. On April 9, House Bill 2129 was voted out of the Texas House of Representatives 115 to 28, with 91% of the Democrats and 66% of the Republicans voting for the measure. The bill died in Senate committee.  Notes and References.  Category:Tax law Category:Government of Texas ","title":"Texas Tax Code Chapter 313"},{"id":"58065457","text":"Stephen P.

In 1977, he and fellow Arizona State University dropout Michael Lacey took the newspaper private and changed the name to the Phoenix New Times. Lacey became editor and Larkin became publisher. The editor-publisher duo were called \\"Lacey'n'Larkin,\\" and over the decades, they bought and started alternative weeklies across the country. Newspaper business The Phoenix New Times was an early and sustained success. Beginning in 1983, Lacey and Larkin bought multiple other alternative newspapers, and by 2000 they owned eleven. In 2005 they bought The Village Voice and five others. The company, now called Village Voice Media, had a market value of $400 million and a combined circulation of 1.8 million. The Internet devoured advertising profits. Village Voice Media reacted to decreased Internet advertising with Backpage.com, beginning in 2004, trying to maintain the company‚Äôs hold on ads for adult services. By 2010, after Craigslist shuttered its adult content section, Backpage.com had become the main financial driver of the company. In 2012 Lacey and Larkin left journalism, sold their interests in all 13 newspapers, but kept ownership of Backpage. The Phoenix New Times was consistently critical of Maricopa County, Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio. This led to a 2007 subpoena requesting the I.P. addresses of all who had visited the Phoenix New Times website over the past three years. When, as an act of civil disobedience, the Phoenix New Times published the subpoena, Lacey and Larkin were arrested for this act. Freed the next day, charges were dropped. Maricopa County settled with them for $3.75 million. Backpage Backpage earned $135 million in 2014, according to a U.S. Senate report. A February 2015 appraisal said the company was worth more than $600 million. The Justice Department used information from a Senate hearing to come up with a massive 93-count indictment in March 2018. The indictment centered on Lacey and Larkin, and accused them and other company officers of money laundering, participating in a criminal conspiracy, and facilitating prostitution.

History  =Early history of Tocal site= The college was established on land originally part of the colonial Tocal Estate which is located on a knoll in the Paterson River valley, NSW. Tocal is in the Hunter Valley region of NSW at the junction of the Paterson River and Webbers Creek. The Paterson River valley was once occupied by the Gringai clan of the Wanaruah (or Wonnarua) Aboriginal people. The diverse ecosystems that were once prevalent in the valley from the rainforest along the river banks to the wetlands, lagoons and surrounding paperbark forests provided an abundance of food, fresh water and materials. The land on which the Tocal Homestead and College is situated was used by the Gringai clan for many years. Grooves worn into rocks by grinding seeds and plants, indicate Tocal was a popular camp site for the Aboriginal people. \\"Tocal\\" is an Aboriginal word, and at one stage it was thought to mean \\"ducks-a-plenty\\" in the local Aboriginal dialect. However, the weight of recent evidence indicates Tocal simply means \\"big\\" or \\"plenty\\". Aboriginal grinding grooves have been located within the homestead complex at Tocal.Desgrand, Margaret \\"C.B. Alexander Agricultural College (Tocal) Nomination\\" (08-02-2013) In 1801 Colonel William Paterson surveyed the area at the request of Governor King. The first wave of Europeans were convict timber loggers as the alluvial river valley was abundant in red cedar. The Paterson River became known as the \\"Cedar Arm\\". The first land grant in the area was made to John Powell in 1818 on land by the river to the south of the town. The river was navigable and the town site was the third to be surveyed in the Hunter Valley and soon became an important river port. Tobacco, grains, grapes, wine and citrus fruits and were cultivated in the area. Shipbuilding also commenced with the development of the river trade. James Webber was granted land at Tocal in 1822 where he went on to produce tobacco and become an early pioneer of viticulture in the colony. Tocal's frontage to the tidal section of the Paterson River gave the property access to the port of Morpeth and shipping access to Sydney. Webber built a two-storey barn which is still extant and drained part of Tocal's wetland. By 1828 Tocal was 3,300 acres after Webber had added to the grant by purchasing adjoining Crown land. The farm land, stone barn, blacksmiths shop, barracks supervisor's cottage remain intact and as a whole include the land upon which the College was later built. Webber sold Tocal in 1834 and by 1843 it was in the hands of lessee Charles Reynolds. Charles Reynolds leased the property from Felix in 1844. He has been described as a \\"genial man of dignity and intelligence\\" who was well respected by those (he) associated (with) in the agricultural industry in NSW as a cattle and horse breeder. During the next 82 years, Charles and subsequently, his widow Frances, his son Frank and grandson Darcie, managed Tocal, to become one of the most important Hereford, Devon and thoroughbred studs in the country. In this period, the road through the property to Maitland improved, although the river trade began to decline. His son, Frank Reynolds finally managed to purchase Tocal from the Wilson family in 1907. The establishment of the railway in 1911 dislocated the operation of the property. In 1926, Jane (Jean) Alexander bought Tocal from the Reynolds family continuing the reputation of Tocal for its successful graziers. The Alexander family consisted of Jean, Isabella, Robert and Charles Alexander, all of whom were elderly and unmarried. By 1939 only Charles remained, and he invited his two nieces, Myrtle and Marquerita Curtis, daughters of his late sister Margaret, to reside with him at Tocal. Charles Boyd Alexander is noted for the introduction of new technologies replacing labour-intensive farming operations, moving Tocal in the direction now associated with modern agriculture.Hathway 2003 p 30 Following Charles' death in 1947, the two sisters remained at Tocal until their death five days apart in 1985, at the ages of 94 and 97 respectively. When Charles Boyd Alexander died in 1947, he left a very large estate and a complex will. His intention was that his substantial estate, comprising not only Tocal but other property and assets, be used to help Protestant orphan and destitute children, for \\"their training to fit them for a life on the land\\".(The C B Alexander Presbyterian Agricultural College.1964, College Prospectus) However, because of the will's nature, an acceptable proposal for the use of the estate did not come before the Equity Court until 1963. It was due to the efforts of Edward Alan Hunt, MBE, a co- founder of the legal practice Hunt and Hunt, Bligh St, Sydney and honorary solicitors for the Presbyterian Church in NSW, that the Equity Court, in 1963, accepted the recommendation of the C. B. Alexander Trustees that the Presbyterian Church be allowed to use the bequest to establish an Agricultural College in the grounds of Tocal at Paterson in addition to a boy's home at Emerald Hills, Leppington, north of Camden. By involving Leppington, the Church met the requirement that the bequest be used to help destitute children. Scholarships from Leppington would be offered at Tocal if any of the boys were to show a bent for advanced training in agriculture. On the other hand, the Alexander Estate could underwrite the cost of the home at Leppington and also build an Agricultural College at Tocal.White 1986 The former would become known as the St Andrew's Presbyterian Agricultural College, Emerald Hills, Leppington, NSW, and the latter as the Charles Boyd Alexander Presbyterian Agricultural College. Hunt's fascination with Tocal that had begun as a child whilst on fishing trips to the Paterson River from his nearby home at Kirkton, near Belford, was to continue for a life time. =Architects and the Emerald Hills project= In 1962, Philip Sutton Cox graduated from the University of Sydney with honours in architecture, with the award of the Royal Australian Institute of Architect's Silver Medal, and with already proven experience in the office of Bruce Rickard as well as a practice in New Guinea, where he designed a number of buildings some of which were published in Architecture Australia. Whilst many of his university colleagues travelled overseas to either northern Europe or North America, Cox was content to stay in Australia to work locally. His first post graduate position was with Figgis and Jefferson at 34 Alfred Street, Milson's Point.Towndrow 1991 pp 94-98 It was while working with this firm in 1962 that Cox's architectural talents were recognised by Edward Alan Hunt who was at the time commencing proceedings in the Equity Court, on behalf of the Presbyterian Church, for the use of the C. B. Alexander Trust. This eventuated after a visit by Hunt, to the home of Philip's father, Ron Cox. Philip's sister, Judith, was married to Edward Alan Hunt's son, David. Hunt was notably impressed by Philip's final year design project for an art gallery, and assured Cox that he would be able to offer him a commission in the near future.Towndrow 1991 p102-103The confirmation of the commission to Philip Cox from the Presbyterian Church to design the two colleges, Leppington and Tocal, materialised whilst he was still working with Figgis and Jefferson, and the initial intention was that Philip would continue with the project in association with Figgis and Jefferson. An initial sketch design for the \\"Emerald Hills\\" project, which was intended to be a country retreat for 40 adolescent boys who had committed juvenile offences, was completed by Cox in late 1962. The drawings bear the title 'Figgis and Jefferson and Philip Cox, Architects in Association, 36 Alfred Street, Milson's Point'.NSW SL PXD 790/398 The buildings are indicated on the elevations more by means of the shadows cast than by line work, a style of drawing which Cox retained throughout his early career. However, Cox long realising that there were philosophical differences, parted the association, establishing Philip Cox and Associates and working solitary on the project in the back of a terrace at 68 Blues Point Road that he and his university friends, Louise Gowing, Philip Atkin, and David Gray, had jointly purchased in 1962, but were obliged to let to cover repayments. Through retained connections with Bruce Rickard, Philip Cox was introduced to Ian McKay and shortly after McKay leased part of the terrace, relocating from the premises he had shared with Bruce Rickard in Phillip Street, Sydney, since 1957. The move was fortuitous. Cox, realising the need for a partner with a greater level of construction experience to make the venture possible, and sharing common architectural interests with McKay, an architect of nearly a decade of experience, the association of the two was inevitable. Both were keenly interested in the Australian landscape and its vernacular buildings, and both admired the architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright, as did many emerging architects in Sydney at the time, for its fundamental principles, celebration of form and structure, textural qualities of natural materials, and the close relationship between the interior of a building and its setting. To these shared interests were added McKay's fascination with Eastern mysticism and architecture, particularly that of Japan, which was to strengthen over the period of their association. Born 23 September 1934, Ian David McKay grew up on a bush property near Coonabarabran, NSW, the son of a farmer and stock and station agent. His grandfather, Ronald Thomas McKay, was a hydraulic engineer who was involved in the Snowy Mountains scheme and was a strong influence, as McKay recalls, for his innate understanding of mechanics and structure.McKay, December 2012 Ian McKay enrolled in the founding year of architecture at the New South Wales University of Technology, Kensington in 1949, and graduated in 1954. One of his first lecturers was Myles Dunphy, whose knowledge of architectural history and understanding of structure including his ability to draw a large scale cross section of Chartres Cathedral in chalk on the blackboard, as well as his avid interest in conservation, of the Australian landscape, was a lasting source of inspiration. Following graduation, Ian McKay travelled overseas to Europe and Asia, attending the international architecture congress on urbanism, CIAM X, in Dubrovnik, returning to Sydney in 1956. After establishing his own practice he shared an office, with Bruce Rickard, from 1957 through to 1962. Rickard had graduated in the same year as McKay, but had spent several years abroad undertaking post-graduate including landscape architecture in Pennsylvania, before returning in 1957 having been deeply impressed by the work of Frank Lloyd Wright. Through his interest in Japanese architecture, he became associated with Muller, Bert Read and Adrian Snodgrass. McKay quickly became one of a number of emerging architects working on Sydney's North Shore. By 1962, in just over five years in practice, McKay's work displayed both sensitivity to context, flexibility and dynamism in the robust use of natural materials and bold forms that explored the structural and textural properties of materials. Whilst the influence of Frank Lloyd Wright is apparent in his works in this period including several houses, in the fluidity of planning incorporating bushland settings and the use of natural timber offset against robust brickwork to heighten their textural qualities, his work was not as derivative of Wright's work as was Rickard's.Taylor 1972 p53 At the Hill House, Cootamundra, he explored the structural possibilities of preformed plywood, and offset its textural qualities with reinforced concrete. His design of the multi-storey experimental vertical shopping block intended solely for women's retail \\"Lasade\\" at 70 Castlereagh Street, Sydney, for which he received the \\"10 Best Building Award\\" in 1961, offset glazed and pressed bronze panels in a curtain wall facade with solid vertical bands of acid etched, precast concrete panels. Work first commenced on the Emerald Hills project. The construction drawings for Emerald Hill are entitled as Ian McKay and Philip Cox, Architects in Association, 68 Blues Point Road, North Sydney and dated January 1963.NSW SL PXD 790/405-407 The design incorporated a series of pavilions arranged along a colonnade to form a series of courtyard spaces around the nineteenth century rural residence \\"Emerald Hills\\" which was to be restored as the warden's residence. Each of the pavilions each utilised low pitched roof forms that reinterpreted forms common in traditional farm buildings particularly skillion roofs that sailed above the lower scale colonnades to provide clerestory skylight. A central bell tower provided a focus to the complex and relieving verticality to the long colonnades and low pitched roofscape, with the advantage that it was climbable. A limited palette of material was maintained throughout. Recycled second-hand bricks were laid in enlarged mortar beds of an ochre colour and the joints struck flush to enhance the sense of solidity, and the roof structure consisted of exposed rough sawn timbers. It was an intention that the architecture was to be domestic rather than institutional in character,(Cox, 2008 p) drawing inspiration from the rural residence on the site. Their immediate client for the project was the Reverend Douglas Cole of the Presbyterian Social Services Department. Cole maintained a strong interest in ecclesiastical art and architecture as well as the sociological aspects in the rehabilitation of youths in the court system. Much discussion and effort was therefore centred on architectural solutions that would promote 'individuality, identity and self-esteem, whilst ensuring that the boys could be part of the College community.Towndrow 1991 p104-105 It was this aspect of the project that keenly interested McKay,McKay December 12 and for which he developed a T-arrangement whereby bedroom accommodation was arranged around courtyards, and each room provided sleeping alcoves for three boys arranged around a common space. McKay and Cox designed much of the furniture including the refectory dining table and chairs, lighting fittings, and signage. The \\"Emerald Hills\\" project was awarded the Sir John Sulman Medal for Outstanding Architecture by the Royal Australian Institute of Architects, the year of its completion, 1963. Peter Johnson, one of the jurors, reported in the Sydney Morning Herald as \\"the achievement of architectural values which derived form a deep concern for people who use the building. It fits naturally into the undulating countryside and the simple materials used- here brick and natural timber- show a sincere and unaffected approach to designits character which is unselfconsciously Australian\\".Towndrow 1991 p109 Freeland credited the 1963 award of the Sulman with legitimizing the Sydney School as more than a regional residential style, writing 'Initiated by a small coterie of Sydney architects, the style was impelled into prominence when the Sulman was made to the Presbyterian's Church's Leppington Agricultural College designed by McKay and Cox'.Freeland 1968 p305 =Tocal College= The opportunity to further develop the ideas explored at Emerald Hills on a grander scale followed soon after with the development of the design for the college at Tocal, which was to be designed as a specialist college for 160 boys and staff on a fully operational farm. The fundamental requirements of the residential college at Tocal were complex and ranged from repetitive sleeping areas to the special use buildings such as a multi-purpose hall, chapel, dining room and kitchen complex for 120 students, residential accommodation for 60 students and associated common room and reading rooms, staff accommodation, classroom accommodation and laboratories, sporting facilities, and outbuildings for piggeries, dairy and poultry, bull pens, barns and stables. An established architect-client relationship, a larger scale of project, a more complex brief, and an expansive site incorporating a colonial homestead complex set within a spectacular regional landscape, provided the two architects with greater opportunities than at Emerald Hills to explore an architectural language derived from a response to the unique site. Ian McKay and Philip Cox were present at the first meeting of the College Council when the site of the College was chosen. Cox describes their first impressions: \\"The site on the crest of the hill overlooking the Paterson Valley was an inspiring one. Tocal is one of the loveliest of settings. It was with excitement and expectation that we wandered around the stone and timber outbuildings; these were some of the best we had ever seen, and were constantly a source for architectural thinking behind Tocal\\".Towndrow 1991 p110 The array of stone and timber farm buildings, barns, stables, woolsheds and pens, laid out around the Georgian homestead formed a village environment, suggesting an array of more intimate spaces to discover and framing dramatic views over the valley. It was the express wish of the benefactor, Charles Boyd Alexander, that the College be situated somewhere on the spur running parallel to the Tocal Road. The reason for this was this spur was the least valuable farming land but afforded fine views over the Paterson River and Webber's Creek valleys and consequently over much of the 2,000 hectare property.McKay and Cox 1964 p.2 The site that Cox and McKay initially selected was at the top of this north facing spur. In the initial sketch designNSWSL PXD 790/455 and PXD 790/482the College buildings were symmetrically arranged around a traditional enclosed cloistered quadrangle comprising quartered parterres with the chapel forming the four side isolating itself from the surrounding farm and the Tocal homestead complex, although the axial relationship with the homestead on the opposing hill was by this time firmly established. The scheme, as it evolved, became far more responsive to its unique setting, drawing greater inspiration from the \\"village environment\\" of the historic homestead complex, and closely integrated with the surrounding landscape. The formal enclosed quadrangle evolved into an open sided quadrangle that embraced the views over the Georgian homestead complex and its encircling lagoon. The location of the College was shifted northwards and lower on the ridge, in order to create a direct visual relationship with the Tocal Homestead complex and its meandering lagoons. At the same time, the revised location enabled the incorporation into the quadrangle of a fine copse of existing trees, and was closer to the agricultural facilities, such as the dairy, poultry yards and the piggery located on the eastern side of Tocal Road near the river.Cox 14 Dec 2012 The axial relationship with the homestead was retained but relaxed, as indicated on the final Regional Plan.NSW SL PXD 790/467 The evolved scheme was consequently a unique response to its setting and far more dynamic. It also allowed for loose extendable planning along the eastern and western wings, with each of the main functional elements grouped around its own courtyard, echoing the greater quadrangle. The amplification of the village environment of the Tocal homestead complex, the clarity of structural expression and the use of vernacular materials, locally sourced and in a natural state were the fundamental principles for the design of the College. Cox explains: \\"Ian and I were resolved that in building this college we were bound to create a tradition that could last for centuries. Timber, brick and clay tiles were to be the vocabulary. No nonsense, no frills; pure structure. The buildings were to merge with the landscape; a complete marriage\\".Towndrow 1991 p111 One of the more important inspirations for the vocabulary of the buildings was to be the barn designed by Edmund Blacket, with its gothic like tracery of exposed timber structure, that Cox dubbed \\"the cathedral of barns\\".Hathway, 2003 p23 Cox later wrote: 'Most impressive was the uncomplicated way the buildings expressed every piece of structure allowing the anatomy to be clearly legible. There was a dignity here similar to the gothic buildings in Europe where the structural forces within are revealed and traced throughout. These buildings reinforced our belief that the way ahead in architecture was to continue this tradition while employing more recent technologies and developing new forms and strategies'.( Cox et al 2008, p 122) Throughout the design of the project these first responses and the initial vision were a constant reference point, with the result that the architects achieved a high level of integrity in the execution of the original design concept. Ian McKay and Cox worked seamlessly together throughout the entire project, almost always in agreement on even the most smallest of details and almost always arriving at the same opinion or conclusion for every decisionThe only reason that their tasks on the project were divided, was due to time constraints, as the College was planned for the first student intake commencing January 1965. The strength of Cox's relationship with E A Hunt was such that it was more practical for Cox to focus on the main hall, whilst McKay had greater involvement with the chapel. The square plan form of the Chapel reflected the Presbyterian ideals of austerity and simplicity, and limitation of symbolic and ritualistic references. The altar tapestry provides the only biblical reference, depicting a passage from the Old Testament Isaiah. The incorporation of the vertical spire was outside the scope of the brief, but both McKay and Cox considered it a necessary vertical focus to the complex as well as a regional landmark. The inspiration for Cox's design of the hall was the barn of the Tocal Homestead designed by Edmund Blacket in 1867. This barn, dubbed by Cox as \\"the cathedral of barns\\" for its tracery of exposed structural timbers, of king post trusses supported by adzed poles and brackets shaped from tree roots, and closely spaced battens supporting the shingled roofing. As with the \\"Emerald Hills\\", McKay and Cox designed much more than just the buildings, including furniture such as the Dining Room's refectory tables and chairs, the lectern, the communion table and chairs of the Chapel, the lighting fittings, fixtures, the commemorative plaques, and signage. The practice expanded in reputation and with employees, including Bob Hooper, Alan Ray and Roy Thistleton, and later Andrzej Ceprinski and Andrew Metcalfe. Both Cox and McKay acknowledge the work of Ceprinski whose enthusiasm, determination and his immense skill at drawing was as invaluable asset.Towndrow p 111, Cox and McKay December 12 The intensity and zealousness of the period and the challenges and difficulties entailed in a large scale project that was innovative in Australia, both in terms of its design and its construction. The drawings retained within the NSW State Library Pictures Collections, File Nos PXD 790/449a-551, entitled \\"C B Alexander Agricultural College, Tocal, Cox Richardson Architects & Planners: selected works, 1967-1979, Architectural and Technical Drawings\\", bear the initials of Cox, McKay, Ceprinski and others. Although the set of drawings is incomplete, their finely execution in ink and pencil, and their level of detail, is testament to the level of commitment to resolution of detail, the skill and the care of the architects involved. The architects' working drawings were approved in November, 1963. The contract to build the College was awarded to Gardiner Constructions Pty Ltd of Newcastle in January 1964 and the first sod was turned for the start of the work on the main contract on 31st January 1964.Tocal College Council, 1964, p5 McKay and Cox considered it essential to the design of the College to exploit skills and materials locally available, and they maintained at all times a close involvement and oversight of the construction of the College, from the preliminary selection of trees prior to felling and bricks through to the final detailing of furniture, fixtures, finishes, light fittings, landscaping, hardware and signage. Cox and McKay even wove the leather webbing for the chapel chairs and designed an alphabetic font for the Chapel's commemorative plaque.Cox December 2012 The architects investigated the availability of bricks of a texture and colour approximating the sandstock bricks utilised in the construction of the Victorian buildings in the Paterson valley.Cox and McKay 1964 p 8 The bricks, both for the walls and the paving, were fired in traditional catenary shaped kilns at a number of local brickworks as the capacity of each was limited for such a volume of brick required.Cox 14 December 12 Maitland is a town renowned for its clay seams and its historic brickworks, now only one remaining. The process produced a high degree of clinkers. Cox recounts the initial dismay of the client in utilising all bricks, including chipped bricks and clinkers traditionally rejected, and the use of thick mortar beds of bush sand with joints struck flush, that emulated the rough masonry of the Tocal farm buildings and achieved a sense of solidity rather than integral units.Cox Dec 12 The stone keystones above every arched brick opening replicate the shape of the keystone above the entrance to the homestead's stone barn constructed 1830. The roof tiles were initially proposed to be terracotta shingles but the cost was prohibitive and Swiss pattern terracotta tiles were finally installed. The emphasis on timber craftsmanship derived from traditional wood crafting methods utilised in the construction of rudimentary Australian rural buildings, required the sourcing of skills and materials no longer easily acquired on the scale required. Most of the structural timbers were to be hardwoods sourced within the region, ironbark, Brushbox and Tallowwood. Joinery timbers for the Chapel chairs was also locally available, although the timber for the Dining Room refectory furniture was sourced from elsewhere. The extensive lengths and cross sectional dimensions that presented a particular challenge, even at the time. Local people \\"bushies\\" skilled with the broadaxe and adze, and carpenters versant with traditional jointing methods were sourced. All timbers were brought to the site directly from felling in the forest, where they were barked, de-sapped and line dressed.Cox 14 Dec 12 Both McKay and Cox recall that the Tallowwood tree for the king pole of the chapel's spire was selected from a Barrington Tops forest by McKay in conjunction with a local miller, the tree felled and brought to the site, where it was barked, roughed squared (or hewn) with a broadaxe and laid on trestles such that the central axis was horizontal. The rough squared trunk was turned every day for several months to ensure even seasoning, so that it its central axis would be straight. McKay recounts that one day it developed a slight bow, and astoundingly, the tree was straightened through releasing the tension on the outer curve of the trunk with a single powerful blow of a broadaxe. After this seasoning process, the trunk was adzed into its final shape.McKay December 2012 Similarly the adzing of over fifty Brushbox trunks to form the colonnade pillars was also undertaken on site by local woodworkers, as too was the construction of the bolsters, or brackets, supporting the roof of the main hall. Each bolster weighed 1 tonne, and comprised three pieces of ironbark that were first shaped and dressed with a broadaxe, before being morticed and tenoned together, and finally dressed with an adze.Guide to Tocal NSW Agriculture p 37 Although technologically the use of traditional methods of construction demonstrates a return to the carpentry and bricklaying of the colonial era of the Tocal homestead, it was an intellectual and emotionally based departure. Roger Pegrum elaborates: \\"Joinery details at Tocal celebrate the skills of those who built a century and a half ago without the benefit of electric saws and routers. Rafters sit squarely on beams, which are cut neatly into posts: Struts are halved over purlins; and the beautiful tusk tenon survives in a world just discovering the convenience of punched steel connectors\\".Pegrum 1988 Both Cox and McKay explain that the knowledge and skills required to effectively craft timber using traditional tools and methods, and the lengths of timber in the cross sections required, are no longer available. As well, structural statutory codes and standards are less flexible and almost would certainly now prohibit the suspended king pole of the chapel.Cox and McKay Dec 2012 Norman and Addicoat (now Norman Disney Young) and Taylor, Thomson and Whitting were the consulting hydraulic and civil respectivelybut specialist structural advice for the timber components of the project was provided by Professor Stan Shaw from the University of New South Wales.Towndrow 1991 p 112 The architects undertook most of the structural design themselves, with the final calculations and certification provided by Shaw. This exemplifies the interest of the architects in structure and the role that structural expression played in the spatial design. The design of the chapel spire presented the most challenging of structural problems, the resolution of which required a unique jointing system utilising exposed stainless steel shear connector plates to connect the halved trusses to the king pole. A concrete ring beam was required to take the thrust of the spire, which was greatest at the four corners of the chapel. McKay's earlier experimentations with the expressive qualities of reinforced concrete in the late fifties and early sixties provided the necessary understanding for integrating a contemporary material with timber that has been crafted using time honoured techniques. Cox recalls that the chapel's spire was so structurally unique incorporating a large scale timber structural joint, beyond the scope of calculations, that Shaw was never completely certain that the king pole would withstand being suspended over a void. Prior to any costing undertaken by a Quantity Surveyor, the architects undertook their own estimations of the first main contract works, in the order of 300,000 pounds. Philip Cox advised the commission of Margaret Grafton for the chapel's altar tapestry. Made of hand spun wool dyed with natural dyes, it took 18 months to complete. This was the first Australian tapestry to be commissioned by an architect for a site specific project and was instrumental in establishing the incorporation of artworks into large scale projects as common practise. The first stage was completed in time for the first intake of fifteen Foundation students for the first term beginning 26 January 1965.Tocal College Council, 1964, p1 One of these was Malcolm Henderson, who photographically recorded the construction of the College and retains the collection of slides..Henderson, 2012 On 5 November, 1965 the College was opened by Sir Robert Menzies, then Prime Minister of Australia. Also in 1965, Ian McKay and Philip Cox were awarded the Sir John Sulman Medal for Outstanding Architecture and later in 1966, the Blacket award, by the Royal Australian Institute of Architects. Cox and McKay also later received the \\"Building of the Decade Award\\" from Lend Lease, in 2005. The College, even during its construction, attracted much interest from the architectural profession. Geoffrey Bawa visited the complex in 1965, remarking that it was \\"the only building in Australia that he admired\\". However, not all shared similar views. The principles demonstrated, including the application of craftsmanship, the emphasis on clarity of structural expression, the use of locally derived forms and locally sourced materials, passive climate control, and loose extendable planning and the integration of the built form with the landscape, were an anathema to the prevailing modernist, international, institutional architecture of its time. Robin Boyd, an emerging architectural critic, considered the project far too retrospective and nostalgic.Towndrow 1991 p 112 and Cox December 2012 The College has been critically acclaimed in numerous written publications by architectural and structural critics, including those by J. M. Freeland and Jennifer Taylor and continues to revered as one of the most important late twentieth century works in Australia, being one of the entries in the Docomomo world survey and was one of the first 20 buildings to be considered under the modernism theme in Australia. It is noted as being an exemplary example of a group of buildings referred to in Apperly's' Identifying Australian Architecture' as illustrating late twentieth century Sydney regionalist architecture applied to a large scale non residential project, as well as Freeland \\"Architecture in Australia\\" follows on from his preceding accreditation that the award of the 1963 Sulman medal to Cox and McKay for the Emerald Hills project impelled the Sydney Style into prominence, further accredits the receipt of both the Sulman and Blacket awards in 1965 to Tocal College, along with the award of the 1964 Sulman medal to Woolley for the design of Goldstein Hall, as \\"the idiom was established\\". Freeland summates the qualities represented as \\"Its underlying qualities were timeless but its appearance was uniquely mid twentieth century. In its development, application and appropriateness it was thoroughly and distinctly AustralianThe construction of the buildings, direct, simple and thoughtful, had a crafted quality and was often exposed as a powerful part of the design. Because it contained much that was Australian generated it seemed to hold a promise that after a century and a quarter Australian architecture might at last be going Australian\\".Freeland 1968 pp305-311 The first Principal was the Reverend Colin Ford, B.SC. Edward Alan Hunt MBE was the first Chairman of the College Council and remained in that office until the handing over to the state government in 1969, after which he continued his involvement with the College until his death in 1982. In acknowledgement of his contribution, his ashes lie in the College chapel. Hunt's son David, and his wife Judy, Philip Cox's sister, have retained association with Tocal and assist in raising funds for conservation works to the buildings. The Presbyterian Church managed the college until 1970 after which it was transferred to the NSW Department of Agriculture as the CB Alexander Agricultural College, Tocal, after the passing of the C B Alexander Foundation Act in 1969. The extent of the Tocal property has been increased to the current 2,200 hectares through various land purchases since the College commenced including Athcourt Farm, Glendarra, Bona Vista, Dunnings Hill, Clements Farm and Numeralla. In 1972, the first female students were admitted. Tocal is now operated by the NSW Department of Primary Industries. The Tocal Field Days are regarded as the Hunter Valley's premier agricultural event as well as being a popular regional social attraction. In 2015 the National Trust of Australia (NSW) classified the Tocal College CB Alexander Campus on their Country Register.  Description  View from the weather station towards the Tocal Homestead Tocal College - C. B. Alexander Campus is the collection of buildings constructed in 1965 to a design by Cox and McKay. It includes the landscaping which is open and sparsely treed and the open landscape between the buildings and Tocal Homestead. The movable collection is limited to the following items: chapel tapestry, chapel chairs, chapel organ, tables and benches in dining room and conference room, padded leather chairs and small square occasional tables. The Tocal farm estate comprises 2,200 hectares in the Hunter Valley region of NSW, approximately 15 kilometres north of Maitland. The estate extends along the valley floor at the confluence of the Paterson River and Webber's Creek, encircled by watershed ranges to the northwest and northeast, forming a remarkably beautiful contained setting. The College forms part of the Tocal farm estate, and is set on a long low north facing ridge that overlooks the Paterson River and the lower ridge of the Tocal Homestead complex, the two separated by an extensive meandering lagoon. The first impression of the College via glimpses from Tocal Road through stands of Spotted Gums, is of a long low complex straddled along the ridge; of massive, shielding walls of sandstone coloured brickwork, deeply folded into narrow window openings thrown into deep shadow, and above which rises a spire of unexpected height. The College entrance road winds up the ridge before straightening along the central axis that extends through the entrance vestibule and the Chapel's spire. The broad roof of the entrance vestibule sweeps low over the stepped entrance platform and from this unassuming arrival point one is led into a large open sided quadrangle where the spatial qualities and the architecture of the entire complex unfolds. The main campus buildings are arranged around a cloistered quadrangle, but European monastic references are tempered by its loose, open sided, formation. The northern side of the quadrangle is ingeniously left open to direct the eye northwards to the colonial Tocal Homestead on the hill opposite, and to embrace the broader landscape setting, creating one unified and unique composition, encompassing College, Homestead and the Paterson valley setting. The loose fit of the College buildings is reminiscent of Australian farm complexes, importantly the Tocal Homestead, whereby vistas to the surrounding landscape are framed by the array of farm structures. Focus on the quadrangle is retained, and intensified, by the central placement of the College chapel with its dramatic spire, and by the encircling colonnades that serve as the primary circulation between the main campus buildings, providing shade and shelter from conditions on the exposed ridge. The central placement of the chapel divides the quadrangle into two, more intimate, courtyard spaces, each assuming a different character through modelling of the ground plane. The quadrangle is unified by the simple repetition of forms and structure, enhanced by the play of light and shadow, and by a limited palette of locally sourced materials; brick, timber, and terracotta tile, all chosen for their textural qualities. The rendition is reminiscent of traditional Japanese architecture, yet the selection of materials and their crafting is distinctly derived from local rural traditions. The hovering, low pitched, stepped roof planes of the campus buildings are swept low over the colonnades supported at their perimeter by robust posts of raw adzed Brushbox baulks, supported on sandstone plinths and girt by punched steel collar straps that add to the textual effect. Rubble drains, used in lieu of gutters, add texture to the ground plane. Copper gutters are only included where necessary over entrances and the like. A modular grid of 2,700mm (nine feet, zero inches) applied throughout orders the placement of structure and space. The repetition of colonnade posts, exposed projecting rafters, paired above each post, their ends painted white in traditional Japanese fashion, establishes a powerful unifying rhythm, intensified by the dark shadows cast on the ochre coloured pavement and walls. The unglazed terracotta tiled roofs have acquired a green tone of algae almost a verdigris colour that further adds to the rustic effect. Spaces between the main quadrangle buildings lead to smaller courtyards that are treated in the same manner. The brickwork throughout the college is modelled to intensify its visual strength. Walls are buttressed, battered, and folded into reveals being supported at horizontal folds by concealed permanent formwork of reinforced concrete, openings are narrow and glass is deeply recessed to provide shade. The selection of light earth toned, kiln fired bricks throughout, set in unusually thick, flush struck, beds of ochre coloured mortar, enhances the sense of solidity and references the underground brick silos, the stables and barns of the Tocal Homestead, as well as Webber's original cottage of 1822. The brickwork is purposefully rough to confirm the rustic and robust nature of the buildings, every clinker or chipped brick utilised. Similar coloured kiln fired bricks are used as paving throughout the colonnades and the interiors of the buildings, and the ground plane is modelled with sunken terraces, such that the walls appear to rise out of the earth. Door openings are spanned by pointed arches locked by keystones of honed sandstone, the shape of the keystones reminiscent of the Tocal stone barn of 1830. The common palette of materials, of brick, timber and terracotta tile, and the extensive colonnades connecting the main campus buildings make for a unified complex but within this uniformity there are marked contrasts of architectural expression. Each of the main buildings flanking the quadrangle is necessarily varied in design by its function, maintaining an individual character and structure expression. Structural expression and the textural qualities of exposed natural finishes, form the major role in defining the character of each space. The timber structure is expressed and robust, referencing the timber woolsheds, barns and tank stands of the Tocal Homestead, yet the ingenuity of some of the College timber structures is such that commonplace structural terminology is not always applicable. Of these, the Chapel and the Edward Alan Hunt Hall, are structurally the most remarkable and innovative, and exhibit the highest level of brick and timber craftsmanship. The Chapel, is pivotal to the design of the complex; cradled within the quadrangle, and centred on the north south axis that runs through the centre of the main entrance and the quadrangle in a northerly direction to the original Tocal homestead building. The building is square in plan with battered brick walls supporting a low clerestory above which a spire that rises a further 30 metres in height, its apex surmounted by a two-metre-high () cast stainless steel cross. The dramatic form of the chapel's spire is not only a focal point to the College, but also a landmark that visually links the College complex with the Tocal Homestead and the surrounding Tocal farm estate. In contrast to the lofty steeple, the low massive battered brick walls of the chapel enclose a cave like interior. The level of natural light to the interior is minimal, channelled through deeply recessed and narrow openings confined to the east and west aisles, and its colour rendered by ochre coloured glazing. Four discreet shafts of light reveal the intricate tracery of roof timbers from small gablets high on the steeple. Materials are left in their natural state; brick walls left as exposed face, floors of brick paving, off-form concrete using undressed timber boarding, and roof framing timbers exposed to view beneath ceilings of timber boarding. Despite the simplicity of the square plan form, the design of both the brickwork and the timber structure is highly complex and explores timber technology beyond that of the vernacular Tocal buildings. From the low battered external walls spring brick buttresses that brace a massive concrete ring beam spanning between an inner line of brick pillars. These pillars play a dual role in forming side aisles on the eastern and western sides of the interior. From the four corners of the ring beam spring the low raked intercepting timber trusses that support both the clerestory roof framing and the massive king post of the spire. Both the trusses and the king pole are made from Tallowwood (Eucalyptus microcorys) sourced from forests within the locality, and barked, de-sapped and line dressed on site. The king post is composed of three lengths, each diminishing in thickness from an initial 450mm, as it ascends suspended over the chapel, over 30 metres in height. The load of the pole is transferred to the trusses by stainless steel shear plates sleeved between the laminated sections that compose the chords of each truss. Attention to detail extended to every aspect of the interior finishes and the construction: each concrete roof tile of the spire was double wired and further fastened to the timber battens with two brass screws. The raw medieval character of the chapel's interior is reinforced by the furniture and furnishings specifically designed for the space, including the face brick lectern and communion table, and the Blackwood (Acacia melanoxlyon) framed chairs with woven leather webbing designed by Cox and McKay, the organ, and the tapestry hung behind the altar that depicts a passage from the Old Testament Isaiah. Created by Margaret Grafton, and woven of hand spun wool dyed with natural dyes, its warm colours and soft texture contrast with the raw Spartan interior. The marble commemorative tablet, designed by the architects, rests directly beneath the king post. The main hall, named after Edward Alan Hunt, is located to the western side of the main entrance and was designed as a multifunctional space, for theatre, badminton, basketball, gymnastics and other purposes. For this reason it has a suspended timber floor of Brushbox rather than brick pavement utilised elsewhere in the common campus buildings. The inspiration for the Hall was the barn of the Tocal Homestead designed by Edmund Blacket in 1867. This barn, dubbed by Cox as \\"the cathedral of barns\\" for its tracery of exposed structural timbers, of king post trusses supported by adzed poles and brackets shaped from tree roots, and closely spaced battens supporting the shingled roofing. The enclosing walls of the hall are articulated by faceted buttresses, between which window and door openings are cradled, achieving massive depth. In the tradition of medieval gothic churches, the roof trusses are supported by enormous brackets, each comprising three pieces of adzed ironbark mortised together. The brackets rest on off-form concrete corbels, that project from the brick work wall behind. From the bottom chord of each truss radiate a spray of struts supporting intermediary rafters, reminiscent of Aalto's S√§yn√§tsalo Town Hall. In the same plane as the bottom chord of each truss is a dia-grid that supports cylindrical timber lined light fittings. The faceted backdrop of the hall stage is constructed of Blackbutt (Eucalyptus pilularis). The Dining Room complex is located at the northern end of the eastern arm of the quadrangle separated from the Chapel by a sunken courtyard. The interior of the Dining Room consists of a similar sunken brick paved floor, focused on a broad brick fireplace spanned by a deep off-form concrete beam. The roof structure is a simpler version of the E. A. Hunt Hall, consisting of roof trusses, from the bottom chord of which radiate a spray of struts supporting inter-mediatory rafters. The refectory style tables and seating benches and the light fittings, designed by the architects, are similar to their previous design for the dining room at Emerald Hills. The Kitchen is located adjacent to the Dining Room and opens onto a service courtyard. The student accommodation forms the western side of the main quadrangle. The bedrooms are paired and arranged in long rows, accessed from the internal facing colonnades. Each row is linked by cross colonnades so as to enclose a series of intimate courtyards and frame glimpses of the broader landscape of the farm beyond. The design is additive, with potential for additional blocks should they be required in the future. Each row is covered by a simple skillion roof allowing the inclusion of clerestory windows for natural lighting and ventilation, while maintaining privacy. As elsewhere, the brickwork is folded inwards to form deeply recessed openings providing both sun shading and privacy. The classrooms complex and administrative offices are located at the southern end of the eastern arm of the quadrangle separated from the entrance vestibule by an intimate courtyard. A separate entrance, a later addition, is marked by a tower form again reminiscent of Aalto's Saynatsalo Town Hall gives direct access to the Classrooms from the entrance driveway. The landscape of the campus reinforces the local setting and incorporates original scattered stands of Spotted Gum (Corymba maculata) with planted stands of She-Oak or Forest Oak (Allocasuarina torulosa), and under plantings of xanthorrhoeas, grevilleas and callistemons. = Condition = The college buildings were reported to be in very good and highly intact condition as at 27 September 2012. The complex is highly intact. The loose extendable nature of the original planning of the College purposefully anticipated the need for future additional residential rooms and teaching facilities, particularly the planning of the eastern and western wings. One of the few alterations made to the original construction, is the alteration to the sunken courtyard to the East of the Chapel, whereby the original open pavement with ground covers providing margins to the brick pavers has been replaced by a homogeneous brick pavement. The vision for the buildings was to mature with age and merge with the landscape. The selection of materials, such as hardwood timbers and facebrick, and the design of the buildings that incorporates large roof overhangs, colonnades and deeply recessed openings, provides a high degree of weather protection. The complex has proven to be durable and extremely low maintenance. = Modifications and dates = * 1967: Student rooms Nos 63-93 constructed, providing accommodation for an additional 30 students.

Alexander Campus represents the historical shift in institutional architecture from one dominated by international modernist trends to one that was more locally based in its ideology. The architecture of Tocal College applies the design characteristics of the Late Twentieth Century Sydney Regional or Sydney School on an institutional scale. Expressive structural use of robust and enduring materials seamlessly integrated within its landscape setting was a groundbreaking approach to institutional design. The application of these design principles, previously only domestically applied, was to be influential in the history of Australian architecture. These principles established a new architectural approach which rivalled the prevailing institutional architecture which was based in international modernism. The locally based approach through choice of vernacular materials and forms, (such as the language of the Tocal barn) and the environmentally sensitive response to location is credited with being a truly Australian architecture. The architects of the college, Philip Cox and Ian Mackay, are highly regarded in the architectural profession and the college was an important accomplishment early in their respective careers. In 1965 Tocal College received the Australian Institute of Architects highest honour, the Sulman Medal, and today is held in very high esteem by the architectural profession for its cultural value as a seminal work of architecture that played a significant role in the direction of Australian architectural practice in the latter half of the twentieth century. Tocal College is an outstanding example of the Sydney School style of architecture as applied on an institutional scale. Tocal College is historically significant for its association with Tocal Homestead and Tocal Farm which is one of the oldest colonial properties in the Hunter Region and played a significant role in the history of agriculture in New South Wales. Tocal College - C.B. Alexander Campus continues to play a part in the agricultural history of the state by providing agricultural education. The movable collection was designed to complement the design of the College and contributes to its integrity. The tapestry is a significant art work by renowned Australian textile artist Margaret Grafton and is integral to the aesthetic significance of the chapel interior. Tocal College - C.B. Alexander Campus was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 17 April 2013 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Tocal College - C.B. Alexander Campus is located on the lands of the Tocal estate; Tocal Homestead is one of the oldest colonial homesteads in the Hunter Region and played an important role in the development of agriculture over the last 150 years. (Desgrand) Tocal is historically significant as the legacy of Charles Boyd Alexander of the Alexander family, owners of Tocal estate in the 20th century. Tocal College continues the agricultural tradition through provision of agricultural education. Tocal College - C.B. Alexander Campus represents the historical shift in institutional architecture from one dominated by European Modernist trends to one that was more locally based in its ideology. The College design successfully adapted a previously vernacular approach to a large scale project which was a groundbreaking approach for its time. The high level of craftsmanship, the use of robust and enduring materials applied to institutional buildings was a methodology which was to be influential in the history of Australian architecture. The esteem with which the architecture profession regarded the building was reflected in the award of the prestigious Sir John Sulman Medal in 1965. The Chapel's tapestry was the first Australian tapestry to be commissioned by an architect for a site specific project and was instrumental in establishing the incorporation of art works into large scale projects as common practise. (Desgrand) The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Tocal College - C.B. Alexander Campus is of significance as an important work in the career of one of the most eminent Australian architects, Philip Cox, who played a significant role in Australia's cultural history and the establishment of the notable architectural firm, the Cox Group which is recognised nationally & internationally for its innovative work. The College marks the commencement of Cox's extensive architectural career.(Desgrand) The College is also of significance as an important work in the career of Ian McKay, confirming his reputation for acute environmental sensitivity and his flexibility and inventiveness in design. The design of the College provided an opportunity to synthesize the influences of Frank Lloyd Wright and traditional Japanese architecture evident in his earlier works to create a highly successful vigorous large scale work.(Desgrand) Tocal College - C.B. Alexander Campus is also associated with Leppington Boys Home (St Andrews Agricultural College) which was built prior to Tocal and was instrumental in enabling the C.B. Alexander bequest to be endowed to Tocal College. The college at Leppington was awarded the Sulman Medal in 1963 and the building was an architectural precursor to the college at Tocal. Tocal College is associated with Edward Alan Hunt solicitor and Mayor of Parramatta who was the founder of the College and its first Chairman. Australian artist Margaret Grafton, designed the tapestry in the chapel and went on to become a highly regarded Australian artist. The College is associated with Charles Boyd Alexander, who is noted for the introduction of twentieth century mechanised farming practises to Tocal, and who bequeathed Tocal and other property and assets to be used for the training of Protestant children for agricultural careers. (Desgrand) The College has a minor association with Sir Robert Menzies who officiated at the opening in 1965. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Tocal College - C.B. Alexander Campus is of State significance as an exemplary work of architecture that played an important role in the direction of architecture in Australia. The design of the College demonstrates an unprecedented appreciation of the Australian rural vernacular in its use of bold simple forms, its rigorous expressive use of timber structure and the exploitation of hand crafted timber for its textural qualities.(Desgrand) Whilst the emphasis on structural expression to render space is reminiscent of traditional Japanese architecture and gothic Europe, the work at Tocal was the first major exploration of structural expressionism incorporating an inventive use of locally sourced materials and a high level of craftsmanship derived from local rural traditions previously only associated with the rural vernacular tradition.(Desgrand) The principles demonstrated in the design of the College epitomize the Late Twentieth Century Sydney Regional style or \\"Sydney School\\" as it became known, including its loose extendable planning, the integration of the built form with the landscape, the application of craftsmanship, the emphasis on clarity of structural expression, the use of locally derived forms and locally sourced materials, and the emphasis on passive climate control. In the application of these principles to a large scale institutional college, it was instrumental in establishing a new approach to rival the prevailing international modernist institutional architecture of its time. (Desgrand) Architects Phillip Cox and Ian MacKay's uniquely Australian response to materials and location and is credited with being the beginnings of a truly Australian architecture. Notable architectural historian, J.M. Freeland, attributes Tocal College with bringing the \\"thoroughly and distinctly Australian\\" style into prominence. The movable collection is aesthetically significant as it was specifically designed by the architects to complement the architecture of the College. In particular the chapel tapestry is a significant aesthetic element of the chapel interior. The open sparsely-treed dry landscape is significant in its aesthetic role in defining the spatial arrangement of campus buildings. The open landscape between the college main quadrangle and the Tocal Homestead is also a significant aspect of the setting of the College and was a determining factor in the choice of location of the College and its orientation. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Tocal College - C.B. Alexander Campus is held in very high esteem by the architectural profession for its cultural value as a seminal work of architecture that played a significant role in the direction of Australian architectural practice in the latter half of the twentieth century. This is evidenced through numerous publications which demonstrate the high esteem of the profession for example: in the 60th Anniversary issue of the Architecture Bulletin November/December 2004, the building was nominated as the \\"Building of the Decade\\" for the 1960s (Degrand) and the DOCOMOMO survey of modernist buildings included Tocal College in their priority list of 20 buildings. Graduates of C.B. Alexander Campus and the local community also have a special association with the place as evidenced by the popularity of the College open days. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Does not satisfy this criterion at a State level. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Does not satisfy this criterion at a State level. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Tocal College - C.B. Alexander Campus is an outstanding example of the Late Twentieth Century Sydney Regional (Sydney School) style of architecture as applied on an institutional scale. The principles commonly demonstrated by the Sydney School including; the application of craftsmanship, the emphasis on clarity of structural expression, the use of locally derived forms and locally sourced materials, passive climate control, and loose extendable planning and the integration of the built form with the landscape, were an anathema to the prevailing modernist, international, institutional architecture of its time.

Origins According to tradition, the Banu Umayya and Banu Hashim both descended from a common ancestor, Abd Manaf ibn Qusai, son of the progenitor of the Quraysh tribe, Qusai ibn Kilab, and they originally came from the city of Mecca in the Hijaz. The Hashemites took their name from Hashim ibn Abd Manaf, while the Umayyads descended from another son, Abd Shams ibn Abd Manaf, taking their name from his son, Umayya ibn Abd Shams. Hashim ibn 'Abd Manaf (the paternal great-grandfather of the Islamic prophet Muhammad) and 'Abd Shams ibn Abd Manaf were conjoined twins - born with Hashim's leg attached to Abd Shams' head. It was said that they had struggled in the womb, each seeking to be firstborn. Their birth was remembered for Hashim being born with one of his toes pressed into the younger twin-brother, Abd Shams's, forehead. Legend says that their father, 'Abd Manaf ibn Qusai, separated his conjoined sons with a sword and that some priests believed that the blood that had flown between them signified wars between their progeny. The astrologers of Arabia opined that Abd Munaaf had committed a grave error when he separated his sons by means of a sword; they did not regard his deed as a good omen. Bani Umayyah became enemies of the Bani Hashim when Hashim banished his brother, 'Abd Shams ibn Abd Manaf, from Mecca. Abd Shams spent most of his exile in Syria, where he became prominent as a tradesman. During the late 6th century, the Hashemites were the custodians of Mecca's sacred precinct, the Kaaba, which housed the idols of 360 tribal deities and drew pilgrims from all over Arabia to the city's bustling seasonal markets. The caravans supplying these markets were operated by the Hashemites‚Äô cousins, the Umayyads. The Umayyads occupied positions of authority in the Meccan city- state and staunchly guarded the tribal codes, hierarchies, and commercial practices that supported the city's mercantile economy, enriching and empowering their clan in the process.https://marginalia.lareviewofbooks.org/on-the-origin-of-caliphates-by- hamza-m-zafer/ When Muhammad, a minor Hashemite merchant, began publicly preaching Islam and decrying the inequity that underpinned the city's social structure in 613 CE, the Umayyads led other Meccan clans in opposition to Muhammad and his message. They reacted to his teachings by levying a crippling commercial and marital boycott on the Hashemite clan. As a result of this persecution, most of Mecca's Hashemites left their native city and resettled in the oasis city of Medina in 622 CE. Armed conflicts during Muhammad's time Medina lay 200 miles north of Mecca, on the caravan way to Syria. After Muhammad and his followers migrated to Medina, they frequently launched raids on passing Meccan caravans. When a caravan belonging to Abu Sufyan ibn Harb, the leader of the Banu Umayya, was attacked near Medina, the Quraysh decided to launch an assault on the Muslims. The decisive battle, the first in the history of Islam, took place near the weils of Badr, outside Medina, on 13 March 624. In the pre-battle duels, three Hashimites from the Muslim side (Ali, Hamza and Ubaydah) engaged three Umayyads from the Meccan side (Walid, Utbah and Shayba). Ali killed Walid, and Hamza killed Utbah. Ubaydah was killed by Shaybah, but not before fatally wounding his opponent. Thus, with the three Meccan chiefs from the Banu Umayya being dead, the battle started with the Meccan side seemingly demoralized, and ended in a Muslim victory. From that day onwards, it is said that the rivalry between the two clans developed into a severe case of tribal animosity. Muhammad had ordered that those Hashimites who were fighting in the side of the Meccans at Badr, including his uncle Abbas ibn Abdul-Muttalib were not to be killed. Reacting to this, Abu Hudhayfa ibn 'Utba, a Muslim belonging to Banu Umayya, and a son and brother respectively of the Meccan warriors killed in the duels, remarked: \\"Shall we kill our fathers, brothers and children, and leave al-Abbas? By Allah! If I meet him, I will kill him with the sword.\\" Abbas was eventually captured, but released by Muhammad and allowed to return to Mecca. In contrast, the Umayyad elder Uqba ibn Abu Mu'ayt was executed on Muhammad's orders after being captured. This made the Banu Umayya even more bitter and hardened against Islam, and Abu Sufyan, the leader of the Banu Umayya (and of the entire Quraysh confederation after Abu Jahl's death) swore by pagan gods Al-Lat and Al-'Uzz√° to get revenge on Muhammad and the Muslims. The two sides met again next year in the Battle of Uhud. Led by Abu Sufyan, the Meccans managed to gain a victory, albeit a Pyrrhic one. When Hamza, Muhammad's uncle who had killed Utbah ibn Rabi'ah in Badr, was killed, Hind bint Utbah, the daughter of Utbah and wife of Abu Sufyan, is reported to have cut open the corpse of Hamza, taking out his liver which she then attempted to eat.Ibn Ishaq (1955) 380‚Äî388, cited in Peters (1994) p. 218 Abu Sufyan, after some brief verbal exchanges with Muhammad's companion, Umar (Umar ibn al- Khattab),Ibn Ishaq records this exchange as follows: decided to return to Mecca without pressing his advantage.\\"Uhud\\", Encyclopedia of Islam OnlineWatt (1974) pp. 138‚Äî139 Two years later, Abu Sufyan led the Meccan forces on a third assault on Medina, driven back after the Muslims dug a trench around the city. After the subsequent Treaty of Hudaybiyyah was breached by the Quraysh, Muhammad led his army into Mecca. Most of the Umayyads, including Abu Sufyan and his sons Muawiyah and Yazid converted to Islam. Others, like Hind bint Utbah and Abdallah ibn Sa'd became fugitives, but they also converted to Islam later. In his later years, Muhammad gave prominent roles to some late converts from the Banu Umayya, possibly as a way to keep them in check and prevent them from apostatizing.https://www.world- federation.org/sites/default/files/uploaded_files/The_Succession_to_Muhammad- Wilferd_Madelung.pdf After Muhammad After the death of Muhammad, Abu Bakr was chosen as Caliph (successor to the prophet) and leader of the Muslims. He belonged to the Banu Taym, a clan of a somewhat lower status in the hierarchy of the Quraysh. Abu Sufyan, representing the Banu Umayya, and Muhammad's uncle Abbas, representing the Banu Hashim, are reported to have offered Ali military help in men and weapons in case he wanted to fight Abu Bakr, but Ali rebuked them.https://www.al-islam.org/nahjul-balagha-part-1-sermons/sermon-5-o-people- steer-clear-through-waves-mischief When Abu Bakr's caliphate was secured, Abu Sufyan is believed to have approached him, asking him to appoint his sons to certain posts of prominence in return for Banu Umayya's compliance. Abu Bakr made Abu Sufyan's son Yazid commander of one of the armies that were to invade Syria.https://www.al-islam.org/restatement-history-islam-and-muslims-sayyid- ali-ashgar-razwy/revival-umayyads The second caliph, Umar, made an exception in his strict rule of appointing early Muslim converts to prominent posts, by appointing the late convert Yazid ibn Abi Sufyan - and later Yazid's brother Muawiyah - to the post of Governor of Syria. In the election that took place after Umar's death, the Meccan political elites overwhelmingly favored the Umayyad Uthman over the Hashimite Ali. This, according to Wilferd Madelung, was a result of the Meccan families' unwillingness to accept that the Hashemite family would hold both prophethood and caliphate. Historian Ibn Abi'l-Hadid recorded a conversation between the caliph Umar and Abdullah ibn Abbas, in which Umar said: \\"The Quraysh will never unanimously agree to Ali‚Äôs Caliphate, and if he is ever selected as Caliph, the Arabs will attack him from every direction.\\"https://www.al-islam.org/the-hidden-truth-about-karbala- ak-ahmed/chapter-4-nomination-ali-caliphate-prophet-s The third caliph, Uthman, was from the Umayyad family. His policy is characterized as nepotist, giving his family members most of the positions of government and administration. This earned him the enmity of prominent non-Umayyad companions (such as Talhah, Abd al-Rahman ibn Awf and Muhammad's widow Aisha), as well as the Arab tribes of Iraq and Egypt, who fell cheated by the caliph's insistence to give much of the war booty to his Umayyad kinsmen. From Egypt, a contingent of about 1,000 people were sent to Medina, with instructions to assassinate Uthman and overthrow the government. Similar contingents marched from Kufa and Basra to Medina. They sent their representatives to Medina to contact the leaders of public opinion. The representatives of the contingent from Egypt waited on Ali, and offered him the Caliphate in succession to Uthman, which Ali turned down. The representatives of the contingent from Kufa waited on Al- Zubayr, while the representatives of the contingent from Basra waited on Talhah, and offered them their allegiance as the next Caliph, which were both turned down. In proposing alternatives to Uthman as Caliph, the rebels neutralized the bulk of public opinion in Medina and Uthman's faction could no longer offer a united front. Uthman had the active support of the Umayyads, and a few other people in Medina.Muhammad and the Conquests of Islam, Francesco Gabrieli, London 1968 When Uthman was finally killed by the rebels in June 656, the people of Medina elected Ali as the Caliph. Ali vs. Muawiyah Muawiyah, the long-time governor of Syria and son of Abu Sufyan, refused to pledge allegiance to Ali, accusing him of having instigated the murder of Uthman. Muawiyah let it be known that he considered the Banu Hashim collectively responsible for the blood of Uthman, thus reviving the old vendetta. Muawiyah's cousin Al-Walid ibn Uqba addressed Ali with such words: \\"Surely your kinsmen, the 'Abd al-Muttalib, are the ones who killed 'Uthman in incontrovertible truth, out of wrongdoing and aggression, without a claim of blood revenge, and you are the most worthy of the people to be jumped upon, so jump.\\" Marwan ibn al-Hakam accused Ali: \\"If you, 'AIT, have not struck the murdered man openly, you surely struck him in secret.\\"If you, 'AIT, have not struck the murdered man openly, you surely struck him in secret. Ali, in the meantime, had to face the rebellion of Aisha, Talha and Zubayr, who also accused him of killing Uthman. Not all Umayyads were prone to fight against Ali - some considered him a closer tribal relative than Talhah and Zubayr. Sa'id ibn al-'As, who had followed Talhah and Zubayr en route to Basra, declared that he would not strive to take the reign away from the Banu 'Abd Manaf (the common ancestral name of both the Hashemites and the Umayyads) and turned back. After Ali defeated the opposition in the Battle of the Camel (December 656), he demanded from Muawiyah to abdicate his post of governor of Syria. Muawiyah refused, once again accusing Ali of being responsible for the murder of Uthman, and began raising an army. Ali also made preparations for battle, and the two armies met on July 657 in Siffin. Prior to the battle, Walid ibn Uqba again accused the Banu Hashim of bearing collective guilt for Uthman's murder: > Banu Hashim, return the arms of your sister's son, do not loot them, his > loot is not licit. Banu Hashim, do not hasten to invite retaliation, the > same to us are his murderers and his plunderer. Banu Hashim, how could there > be negotiation between us when his sword is with 'All and his noble horses. > They killed him in order to be in his place just as once Chosroes was > betrayed by his Marzpans. I surely shall travel to you in a boundless host > whose noise and turmoil will deafen the ear. Historian Yaqubi wrote that Ali had 80,000 men, including 70 Companions who participated in the Battle of Badr, 70 Companions who took oath at Hudaibia, and 400 prominent Ansars and Muhajirun; while Muawiya had 120,000 Syrians.Yaqubi, vol 2, p. 188. Tarikh Al-Yaqubi (Tarikh Ibn Wadih). William Muir wrote that, > Both armies drawn out in entire array, fought till the shades of evening > fell, neither having got the better. The following morning, the combat was > renewed with great vigour. Ali posed himself in the centre with the flower > of his troops from Medina, and the wings were formed, one of the warriors > from Basra, the other of those from Kufa.

Four of its > five ranks were cut to pieces, and Muawiya, bethinking himself of flight, > had already called for his horse, when a martial couplet flashed in his > mind, and he held his ground.William Muir, The Caliphate, its Rise and Fall > (London, 1924) page 261 English historian Edward Gibbon wrote: \\"The Caliph Ali displayed a superior character of valor and humanity. His troops were strictly enjoined to wait the first onset of the enemy, to spare their fleeing brethren, and to respect the bodies of the dead, and the chastity of the female captives. The ranks of the Syrians were broken by the charge of the hero, who was mounted on a piebald horse, and wielded with irresistible force his ponderous and two edged sword.\\" Of the estimated casualties, Ali's forces lost 25,000, while Muawiyah's forces lost 45,000. Appalled by the carnage, Ali sent a message to Muawiya and challenged him to single combat, saying that whoever won should be the Caliph. In Gibbon's words, \\"Ali generously proposed to save the blood of the Muslims by a single combat; but his trembling rival declined the challenge as a sentence of inevitable death.\\"Gibbon, Edward. The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. Ch. L, Pgs. 98-99. New York: Fred de Fau and Co. Publishers (1906).Edward Gibbon, The Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire (London, 1848) volume 3, p.522Gibbon, Edward. The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. Ch. L, Page 98. New York: Fred de Fau and Co. Publishers (1906). The earliest account of the battle is found in Ibn Hisham's book (833) where he quotes Ibn Muzahim died 212 AH and Abu Mikhnaf died 170 AH.Bewley, p. 22 from Ibn Hisham from Ibn Muzahim died 212 AH from Abu Mikhnaf died 170 AH It says that after three days of fighting the loss of life was terrible. Suddenly one of the Syrians, Ibn Lahiya, reportedly out of dread of the fitna and unable to bear the spectacle rode forward with a copy of the Quran on the ears of his horse to call for judgement by the book of Allah, and the other Syrians followed suit. Allegedly, those on both sides took up the cry, eager to avoid killing their fellow Muslims except for the conspirators. The majority of Ali's followers supported arbitration. Nasr b Muzahim, in one of the earliest source states that al-Ash ath ibn Qays, one of Ali's key supporters and a Kufan, then stood up and said > O company of Muslims! You have seen what happened in the day which has > passed. In it some of the Arabs have been annihilated. By Allah, I have > reached the age which Allah willed that I reach. but I have never ever seen > a day like this. Let the present convey to the absent! If we fight tomorrow, > it will be the annihilation of the Arabs and the loss of what is sacred. I > do not make this statement out of fear of death, but I am an aged man who > fears for the women and children tomorrow if we are annihilated. O Allah, I > have looked to my people and the people of my deen and not empowered anyone. > There is no success except by Allah. On Him I rely and to Him I return. > Opinion can be both right and wrong. When Allah decides a matter, He carries > it out whether His servants like it or not. I say this and I ask Allah's > forgiveness for me and you. Then, Nasr b Muzahim says people looked at Muawiya who said > He is right, by the Lord. If we meet tomorrow the Byzantines will attack our > women and children and the people of Persia will attack the women and > children of Iraq. Those with forebearance and intelligence see this. Tie the > copies of the Quran to the ends of the spears. So the fighting stopped. It was decided that the Syrians and the residents of Kufa, in Iraq, should nominate an arbitrator, each to decide between Ali and Muawiya. The Syrians choice fell on 'Amr ibn al-'As who was the rational soul and spokesman of Muawiya. 'Amr ibn al-'As was one of the generals involved in expelling the Romans from Syria and also expelled the Romans from Egypt.Islamic Conquest of Syria A translation of Fatuhusham by al-Imam al-Waqidi Translated by Page 31 A few years earlier according to Islamic tradition, 'Amr ibn al-'As with 9,000 men in Palestine had found himself confronting Heraclius' 100,000 army until Khalid crossed the Syrian desert from Iraq to assist him. He was a highly skilled negotiator and had previously been used in negotiations with Heraclius the Roman Emperor.Islamic Conquest of Syria A translation of Fatuhusham by al- Imam al-Waqidi Translated by Mawlana Sulayman al-Kindi Ali wanted Malik Ashtar or Abdullah bin Abbas to be appointed as an arbitrator for the people of Kufa, Iraq, but the QurrƒÅ' strongly demurred, alleging that men like these two were, indeed, responsible for the war and, therefore, ineligible for that office of trust. They nominated Abu Musa al-Ashari as their arbitrator. (During the time of Uthman, they had appointed Abu Musa al-Ashari as the Governor of Kufa and removed Uthman's governor before they started fighting Uthman) Ali found it expedient to agree to this choice in order to ward off bloody dissensions in his army. According to \\"Asadul Ghaba\\", Ali had, therefore, taken care to personally explain to the arbitrators, \\"You are arbiters on condition that you decide according to the Book of God, and if you are not so inclined you should not deem yourselves to be arbiters.\\"\\"Asadul Ghaba\\" vol 3, p. 246. Name of book needed The Iraqis under Ali and the Syrians under Muawiyah were not split over their faith but over when to bring the people who killed Uthman to justice. Ali also wanted to bring them to justice but the dispute was over the timing. According to early Shia sources Ali later wrote: > The thing began in this way: We and the Syrians were facing each other while > we had common faith in one Allah, in the same Prophet (s) and on the same > principles and canons of religion. So far as faith in Allah and the Holy > Prophet (s) was concerned we never wanted them (the Syrians) to believe in > anything over and above or other than what they were believing in and they > did not want us to change our faith.

Muawiyah overpowered Egypt, Yemen and other areas.See: Nahj Al-Balagha Sermons 25, 27, 29, 39 * Al-gharat (Plunders) which has written by Abi Mikhnaf is a detailed report about these raids. In one of these campaigns, Umayyad general Busr ibn Abi Artat callously slaughtered the two infant sons of the Hashemite Ubayd Allah ibn Abbas. Historian Wilferd Madelung writes that Muawiyah had instructed Busr to kill all Hashimites he could lay his hands on. Later, in 661, Ali was assassinated on the 19th of Ramadan, while Praying in the Great Mosque of Kufa. The Kharijite, Abd-al-Rahman ibn Muljam, attacked him during the Fajr prayer, inflicting him a deadly wound with a poisoned sword.Tabatabae (1979), page 192 After Ali's murder, Hasan ibn Ali attained to the caliphate. To avoid the agonies of a further civil war, Hasan signed the Hasan‚ÄìMuawiya treaty with Muawiyah. According to the treaty, Hasan ceded the caliphate to Muawiyah but on the condition that Muawiyah could name no successor during his reign; instead, he was to let the Islamic world choose its successor afterward. The Umayyad Caliphate After having ruled for 19 years as Caliph, Muawiyah decided to nominate his son Yazid I as a successor, thus breaching the Hasan-Muawiya treaty and initiating dynastic rule in Islam. Yazid became Caliph in 680 CE. The grandson of Muhammad, Husayn ibn Ali, refused to pledge allegiance to the new ruler. A few months after Yazid sent out his summons to the Hashemites, Umayyad armies killed Husayn and twenty-one other members of Muhammad's family on the plains of Karbala in Iraq. The casualties included Muhammad's great-grandsons, one of them an infant, while his two last surviving granddaughters, each in their 50s, were captured as prisoners of war. This massacre of the Hashemites‚Äîthe Prophet's family‚Äîcaused upheaval among the emerging empire's religious elites. Nevertheless, the Umayyad action at Karbala secured the family's hold on the caliphate for seventy years. Although the Hashemites no longer posed a direct threat to Umayyad rule, their near annihilation in the Battle of Karbala catalyzed political and ideological divides in the early Muslim community and it is thought to be one of the main causes of the Sunni‚ÄìShia split. Muhammed Al Da'mi writes: > The pre-Islamic rivalry between the two \\"cousin\\" branches of the Quraysh > tribe had proved to be generative and formative in the later decisive > political conflicts and alliances that served in the making of Shi'ism out > of the grand schism after the death of Prophet Muhammed. This schism fed > originally on this familial rivalry to grow and acquire political and social > dimensions which colored the whole history of Islam down to the present > moment, unfortunately. We should note the dynastic tapestry of the sequence > of this prolonged family animosity between the Hashemites and the Umayyads > personalized: it began with Prophet Muhammed (Hashemite) vs. Abu Sufian > (Umayyad), continued with Ali (Hashemite) vs. Mu'awiyah (Umayyad) and it > culminated into the fatal bloody collusion between the two families in the > ruthless suppression, and beheading of al-Husayn (Hashimite) by Yazeed > (Umayyad) when the latter's army crushed the former's revolt at the site of > Karbala on the southern banks of the river Euphrates.

Historians Abu al-Faraj al-Isfahani and Sibt ibn al-Jawzi have related that Yazid, after Karbala, boasted of having taken revenge from Muhammad and the Banu Hashim for his Umayyad forefathers killed at Badr. Yazid is reported to have said: > Had my predecessors lived they would have seen how I took revenge from > Muhammad and Bani Hashim. I have avenged Ahmed (ie. Muhammad) for whatever > he did with my predecessors in Badr. Forsooth the sons of Hashim played with > power, for neither a word came [from God] nor was a revelation sent.

You are one of the targets of my revenge.

The revolt of Zayd ibn Ali, a descendant of Ali, in the 730s, was ill-fated. Zayd, after being abandoned by many of his followers, fought on with a small band until he was defeated by the much larger Umayyad force of Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik, and Zayd fell in battle to an arrow that pierced his forehead. The arrow's removal led to his death. He was buried in secret outside Kufa, but the Umayyads were able to find the burial place, and, in retribution for the rebellion, exhumed Zayd's body and crucified it. They then set it on fire and scattered the ashes, probably in order to prevent his gravesite from becoming an object of pilgrimage. When the Abbasids, who, like Zayd, were Hashemites, overthrew the Umayyads in 750, they in turn exhumed Hisham's body, crucified it, and burned it, out of revenge for Zayd. Abbasid Revolution The Hashimiyya movement (a sub-sect of the Kaysanites Shia) were largely responsible for starting the final efforts against the Umayyad dynasty,G. R. Hawting, The First Dynasty of Islam: The Umayyad Caliphate AD 661‚Äì750, p. 105. London: Routledge, 2002. initially with the goal of replacing the Umayyads with an Alid ruling family.Farhad Daftary, Ismaili Literature: A Bibliography of Sources and Studies, p. 4. London: I.B. Tauris and the Institute of Ismaili Studies, 2004. H. Dizadji, Journey from Tehran to Chicago: My Life in Iran and the United States, and a Brief History of Iran, p. 50. Bloomington: Trafford Publishing, 2010. To an extent, rebellion against the Umayyads bore an early association with Shi'ite ideas.Bryan S. Turner, Weber and Islam, vol. 7, p. 86. London: Routledge, 1998. Matthew Gordon, The Rise of Islam, p. 46. Westport: Greenwood Publishing Group, 2005. A number of Shi'ite revolts against Umayyad rule had already taken place, though they were open about their desire for an Alid ruler. Zayd ibn Ali fought the Umayyads in Iraq, while Abdallah ibn Mu'awiya even established temporary rule over Persia. Their murder not only increased anti-Umayyad sentiment among the Shia, but also gave both Shias and Sunnis in Iraq and Persia a common rallying cry.G.R. Hawting, The First Dynasty of Islam, p. 106. At the same time, the capture and murder of the primary Shi'ite opposition figures rendered the Abbasids as the only realistic contenders for the void that would be left by the Umayyads.G.R. Hawting, The First Dynasty of Islam, p. 113. The Abbasids kept quiet about their identity, simply stating that they wanted a ruler from the descendant of Muhammad upon whose choice as caliph the Muslim community would agree.ŸÑŸÑÿ±ÿ∂ÿß ŸÖŸÜ ÿ°ÿßŸÑ ŸÖÿ≠ŸÖÿØ øALƒ™ AL-RE≈ªƒÄ, Irannica Many Shi'ites naturally assumed that this meant an Alid ruler, a belief which the Abbasids tacitly encouraged to gain Shi'ite support.The Oxford History of Islam, pp. 24‚Äì25. Though the Abbasids were members of the Banu Hashim clan, rivals of the Umayyads, the word \\"Hashimiyya\\" seems to refer specifically to Abd-Allah ibn Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah, a grandson of Ali and son of Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah. According to certain traditions, Abd-Allah died in 717 in Humeima in the house of Mohammad ibn Ali Abbasi, the head of the Abbasid family, and before dying named Muhammad ibn Ali as his successor.Hala Mundhir Fattah, A Brief History of Iraq, p. 76. Although the anecdote is considered a fabrication, at the time it allowed the Abbasids to rally the supporters of the failed revolt of Mukhtar al-Thaqafi, who had represented themselves as the supporters of Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyya. By the time the revolution was in full swing, most Kaysanite Shia had either transferred their allegiance to the Abbasid dynasty (in the case of the Hashimiyya),Farhad Daftary, Ismaili Literature, p. 15.Moojan Momen, An Introduction to Shi'i Islam, pp. 47‚Äì48. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1985. or had converted to other branches of Shi'ism and the Kaysanites ceased to exist.Heinz Halm, Shi'ism, p. 18. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2004. Beginning around 719, Hashimiyya missions began to seek adherents in Khurasan. Their campaign was framed as one of proselytism.

A number of Shi'ite rebellions ‚Äì by Kaysanites, Hashimiyya and mainstream Shi'ites ‚Äì took place in the final years of Umayyad rule, just around the same time that tempers were flaring among the Syrian contingents of the Umayyad army regarding alliances and wrongdoings during the SecondThe Umayyads: The Rise of Islamic Art, p. 40.

At this time Kufa was the center for the opposition to Umayyad rule, particularly Ali's supporters and Shias. In 741‚Äì42 Abu Muslim made his first contact with Abbasid agents there, and eventually he was introduced to the head of Abbasids, Imam Ibrahim, in Mecca. Around 746, Abu Muslim assumed leadership of the Hashimiyya in Khurasan.AB≈™ MOSLEM ·∏¥ORƒÄSƒÄNƒ™, Encyclop√¶dia Iranica. Retrieved 30 April 2014. Unlike the Alid revolts which were open and straightforward about their demands, the Abbasids along with the Hashimite allies slowly built up an underground resistance movement to Umayyad rule. Secret networks were used to build a power base of support in the eastern Muslim lands to ensure the revolution's success. This buildup not only took place right on the heels of the Zaydi Revolt in Iraq, but also concurrently with the Berber Revolt in Iberia and Maghreb, the Ibadi rebellion in Yemen and Hijaz,Daniel McLaughlin, Yemen and: The Bradt Travel Guide, p. 203. Guilford: Brandt Travel Guides, 2007. and the Third Fitna in the Levant, with the revolt of al-Harith ibn Surayj in Khurasan and Central Asia occurring concurrently with the revolution itself.Richard Bulliet, Pamela Kyle Crossley, Daniel Headrick, Steven Hirsch and Lyman Johnson, The Earth and Its Peoples: A Global History, vol.

New York: Simon & Schuster, 2009. and School of Oriental and African Studies Professor Emeritus G. R. Hawting has asserted that even if the Umayyad rulers had been aware of the Abbasids' preparations, it would not have been possible to mobilize against them. On June 9, 747 (Ramadan 25, 129AH), Abu Muslim successfully initiated an open revolt against Umayyad rule,The Cambridge History of Iran, p. 62. Ed. Richard N. Frye.

Close to 10,000 soldiers were under Abu Muslim's command when the hostilities officially began in Merv.Hala Mundhir Fattah, A Brief History of Iraq, p. 77. New York: Infobase Publishing, 2009. On February 14, 748 he established control of Merv,G.R.

Newly commissioned Abbasid officer Qahtaba ibn Shabib al-Ta'i, along with his sons Al-Hasan ibn Qahtaba and Humayd ibn Qahtaba, pursued Ibn Sayyar to Nishapur and then pushed him further west to Qumis, in western Iran.G.R. Hawting, The First Dynasty of Islam, p. 116. That August, al-Ta'i defeated an Umayyad force of 10,000 at Gorgan. Ibn Sayyar regrouped with reinforcements from the Caliph at Rey, only for that city to fall as well as the Caliph's commander; once again, Ibn Sayyar fled west and died on December 9, 748 while trying to reach Hamedan. Al-Ta'i rolled west through Khorosan, defeating a 50,000 strong Umayyad force at Isfahan in March 749. At Nahavand, the Umayyads attempted to make their last stand in Khorosan. Umayyad forces fleeing Hamedan and the remainder of Ibn Sayyar's men joined with those already garrisoned. Qahtaba defeated an Umayyad relief contingent from Syria while his son al-Hasan laid siege to Nahavand for more than two months. The Umayyad military units from Syria within the garrison cut a deal with the Abbasids, saving their own lives by selling out the Umayyad units from Khorosan who were all put to death. After almost ninety years, Umayyad rule in Khorosan had finally come to an end. At the same time that al-Ta'i took Nishapur, Abu Muslim was strengthening the Abbasid grip on the Muslim far east. Abbasid governors were appointed over Transoxiana and Bactria, while the rebels who had signed a peace accord with Nasr ibn Sayyar were also offered a peace deal by Abu Muslim only to be double crossed and wiped out. With the pacification of any rebel elements in the east and the surrender of Nahavand in the west, the Abbasids were the undisputed rulers of Khorosan. Balami depicting As-Saffah as he receives pledges of allegiance in Kufa The Abbasids wasted no time in continuing from Khorosan into Mesopotamia. In August 749, Umayyad commander Yazid ibn Umar al-Fazari attempted to meet the forces of al-Ta'i before they could reach Kufa. Not to be outdone, the Abbasids launched a nighttime raid on al-Fazari's forces before they had a chance to prepare. During the raid, al-Ta'i himself was finally killed in battle. Despite the loss, al-Fazari was routed and fled with his forces to Wasit.G.R. Hawting, The First Dynasty of Islam, pp. 116‚Äì117. The Siege of Wasit took place from that August until July 750. Although a respected military commander had been lost, a large portion of the Umayyad forces were essentially trapped inside Wasit and could be left in their virtual prison while more offensive military actions were made.G.R. Hawting, The First Dynasty of Islam, p. 117. Concurrently with the siege in 749, the Abbasids crossed the Euphrates and took Kufa. The son of Khalid al-Qasri ‚Äì a disgraced Umayyad official who had been tortured to death a few years prior ‚Äì began a pro-Abbasid riot starting at the city's citadel. On September 2, 749, al-Hasan bin Qahtaba essentially just walked right in to the city and set up shop. Some confusion followed when Abu Salama, an Abbasid officer, pushed for an Alid leader. Abu Muslim's confidante Abu Jahm reported what was happening, and the Abbasids acted preemptively. On Friday, November 28, 749, before the siege of Wasit had even finished, As-Saffah, the great-grandson of Muhammad's uncle, al-Abbas, was recognized as the new caliph in the mosque at Kufa.\\"Mahdi.\\" Encyclopaedia of Islam, p. 1,233. 2nd. ed. Eds. Peri Bearman, Clifford Edmund Bosworth, Wolfhart Heinrichs et al. Abu Salama, who witnessed twelve military commanders from the revolution pledging allegiance, was embarrassed into following suit. Just as quickly as Qahtaba's forces marched from Khorosan to Kufa, so did the forces of Abdallah ibn Ali and Abu Awn Abd al-Malik ibn Yazid march on Mosul. At this point Marwan II mobilized his troops from Harran and advanced toward Mesopotamia. On January 16, 750 the two forces met on the left bank of a tributary of the Tigris in the Battle of the Zab, and nine days later Marwan II was defeated and his army was completely destroyed.Bertold Spuler, The Muslim World a Historical Survey, Part 1: the Age of the Caliphs, p. 49. 2nd ed. Leiden: Brill Archive, 1968. The battle is regarded as what finally sealed the fate of the Umayyads. All Marwan II could do was flee through Syria and into Egypt, with each Umayyad town surrendering to the Abbasids as they swept through in pursuit. Damascus fell to the Abbasids in April, and in August Marwan II and his family were tracked down by a small force led by Abu Awn and Salih ibn Ali (the brother of Abdallah ibn Ali) and killed in Egypt. Al-Fazari, the Umayyad commander at Wasit, held out even after the defeat of Marwan II in January. The Abbasids promised him amnesty in July, but immediately after he exited the fortress they executed him instead. After almost exactly three years of rebellion, the Umayyad state came to an end. The victors desecrated the tombs of the Umayyads in Syria, sparing only that of Umar II, and most of the remaining members of the Umayyad family were tracked down and killed.The Oxford History of Islam, p. 25. Ed. John Esposito. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999. When Abbasids declared amnesty for members of the Umayyad family, eighty gathered in Jaffa to receive pardons and all were massacred.Michael A. Palmer, The Last Crusade: Americanism and the Islamic Reformation, p. 40. Lincoln: Potomac Books, 2007. In the immediate aftermath, the Abbasids moved to consolidate their power against former allies now seen as rivals. Five years after the revolution succeeded, Abu Muslim was accused of heresy and treason by the second Abbasid caliph al-Mansur. Abu Muslim was executed at the palace in 755 despite his reminding al-Mansur that it was he (Abu Muslim) who got the Abbasids into power,Richard Foltz, Religions of Iran: From Prehistory to the Present, p. 160. London: Oneworld Publications, 2013. and his travel companions were bribed into silence. Displeasure over the caliph's brutality as well as admiration for Abu Muslim led to rebellions against the Abbasid Dynasty itself throughout Khorasan and Kurdistan.Arthur Goldschmidt, A Concise History of the Middle East, pp. 76‚Äì77. Boulder: Westview Press, 2002. Although Shi'ites were key to the revolution's success, Abbasid attempts to claim orthodoxy in light of Umayyad material excess led to continued persecution of Shi'ites.Donald Lee Berry, Pictures of Islam, p. 80. Macon: Mercer University Press, 2007. On the other hand, non-Muslims regained the government posts they had lost under the Umayyads. Jews, Nestorian Christians, Zoroastrians and even Buddhists were re- integrated into a more cosmopolitan empire centered around the new, ethnically and religiously diverse city of Baghdad.Philip Adler and Randall Pouwels, World Civilizations, p. 214.

The extermination of the Umayyad family by as-Saffah - earning him the nickname \\"The Butcher\\" - and the later forced Christianization of the Spanish-based branch after the Reconquista - now known as the Benjumea family in Spain - has meant that the descendants of the Banu Umayya are scarce today.http://historum.com/middle-eastern-african- history/124672-there-any-descendants-omayyad-tribe-today.html On the contrary, living descendants of Muhammad and the Banu Hashim today are estimated in the tens of millions.

Early life Etches was born in Rotherham, Yorkshire. She was the daughter of Charles Thomas Watkins Etches (1874‚Äì1964) and Agnes Helena Etches (nee Woollen). Her father was a captain in The King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry during World War I. Career Etches started a dressmaking business in 1934, but financial problems led to it being dissolved the following year. She started a new business in the late 1930s, and had \\"widespread fame\\" in the 1940s. According to a feature in Vogue, \\"Her clothes philosophy is for undating simplicity, for an elegance which relies on cut rather than trimming and above all for comfort: this last, an unusual and very welcome viewpoint.\\" Her clients included the actress Vivien Leigh, Margot Fonteyn, Glynis Johns, Constance Collier, Christine Norden, Paulette Goddard, and Valerie Hobson. Etches was also a costume designer for theatre and film, and worked with theatre designer Sophie Fedorovitch, and extensively with Cecil Beaton. According to the Victoria and Albert Museum (V&A;), \\"Matilda Etches is now almost entirely forgotten except as a theatre, ballet and opera costume-maker. However, she was an extremely talented couturier, whose fashionable clothes were innovative and very carefully made.\\" Personal life In 1919, Etches married the engineer Robert Bamford, who founded a company that became Aston Martin. They had a daughter, Patricia Bamford, who married the illustrator Robin Jacques. In 1950, she married the American economist and economics advisor, Paul Homan. She spent her later life in Brighton. After her death, Cecil Beaton wrote an obituary. Legacy Several Etches pieces are in the permanent collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum. Her 1948 evening dress of printed cotton is described as \\"an haute-couture interpretation of the wrapped garments traditionally worn by West African women\\", and a 1949 evening cape. In 1969, Etches donated selected items, and the cotton dress and evening cape were considered by senior V&A; officials to be key acquisitions, the first modern fashion items to be so honoured.

History  The school was first established by William McIntyre, pastor of the West Maitland Presbyterian Church, at the site of the Presbyterian manse. The foundation stone for the school was laid by McIntyre on 25 September 1855; his brother, Rev. Allan McIntyre, was the first rector or principal.William McIntyre Samuel Griffith, future Premier of Queensland and Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia and Charles Pilcher, later a local MP and King's Counsel, were among the students at the school. The Presbyterian High School was relatively short- lived before its closure. A Mrs. Johnson operated a private ladies' high school out of the buildings during the 1870s and 1880s before it was acquired as the first premises of the West Maitland State High School for Girls, which opened on 21 January 1884. The new headmistress, Mary Olsen, was critical of the state of the building as \\"entirely out of repair and unfit for residence\\" and stating that the sanitary arrangements were \\"in such a condition that no students should come to school before improvements had been made\\". The school operated out of the buildings until the 1893 floods; after which Grossmann House was acquired as a new and less flood-prone school site. By 1929, the premises was again being used as a manse. It was threatened with demolition in the 1980s, but was prevented because of heritage concerns.

It is owned and operated by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Kasana‚ÄìLuweero. Location The hospital is located in the town of Luweero, in Luweero District, in the Buganda Region of Uganda. This location is approximately , by road, north of Kampala, the capital and largest city of Uganda. The coordinates of the hospital are 0¬∞49'32.0\\"N, 32¬∞30'04.0\\"E (Latitude:0.825556; Longitude:32.501111). Overview Bishop Ceaser Asili Memorial Hospital, is an urban community hospital, that serves the population of Luweero District. It is the only General Hospital in the district. Due to the good quality of services rendered, many patients travel from other parts of the country to seek services at this facility. History The hospital was founded as Bishop Asili Health Centre, named after the late Bishop Cesare Asili (20 September 1924 ‚Äì 12 October 1988), who served as the Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Lira from 20 September 1968 until his death, 20 years later. In 2006, the clinic was affiliated with the Just Like My Child Foundation (JLMCF), a San Diego-based non-profit, which raised US$30,000 for a diesel generator. Later, a surgical theatre (operating room) was built, an autoclave (sterilizer) and other surgical equipment were procured and a doctor was made available. Besides attending to the health needs of the community, JLMCF became active in the surrounding villages, building schools and working with families and community leaders to start self-sustaining farming businesses, and holding workshops to teach life-skills and mentor more than 1,300 adolescent girls in 12 villages. In 2007, the Clinton Foundation gave the Just Like My Child Foundation to provide HIV pediatric testing through Bishop Asili Hospital. As of August 2018, the hospital provided medical and surgical therapeutic care, treatment for HIV/AIDS, prenatal, obstetric and postnatal care, as well as malaria treatment and prevention in nearly 80 neighboring villages. JLMCF has been able to establish a community health insurance plan, serving over 18,000 individuals. Bishop Asili Hospital is expanding rapidly. During the twelve months that ended in June 2013, the hospital treated 21,000 patients. One year later, that number doubled to 42,000. The Uganda Ministry health designated the facility as a ‚Äúhospital‚Äù from ‚Äúclinic‚Äù, following the acquisition of a laboratory and refrigeration capabilities for blood storage.

He started the first free public school system in Utah, and organized one of the first public high schools. Early years Forbes was born January 29, 1840, in Bangor, Maine. His family later moved to Boston, where he was educated. His parents encouraged him to become a doctor and educated him to that purpose, but his goals were for the sea. In his early twenties he sailed to Calcutta on the family-owned Pocahontas. After arriving in Calcutta, he became first mate on a different ship going to Southern Europe. Upon his return to Boston he found the nation in the midst of a Civil War. He enlisted in Company H, Second Maine Volunteers on April 26, 1861, for six months. As a lieutenant, he fought in Bull Run, the Peninsular Campaign, Antietam, and Chancellorsville. He was a second lieutenant when his service ended on June 9, 1863. The following year he sailed to California, where he accepted a commission as \\"assistant adjutant-general, with the rank of major\\" under John Bidwell. He and a fellow officer left the Army in 1865 to return to the Eastern United States by land, with a side trip through Salt Lake City, where he met Brigham Young. While they were Young's guests, Young suggested they use their education to help the Mormons set up schools. They rejected that idea and headed south from Salt Lake City. In American Fork, Forbes met Nancy Dayton, whose stepfather, Isaac Cooper, ran a boarding house. He stayed at Cooper's boarding house and taught school there. While Forbes was in American Fork, Leonard E. Harrington asked him to organize the schools there, which he did. Harrington helped pass laws to enable the public school system Forbes envisioned. Forbes separated students into grades. A new brick school building, called the Forbes School, was built in American Fork in 1892. Forbes spent 46 years teaching in American Fork and eight years teaching at the Latter Day Saints' college in Salt Lake City and in Riverdale, Utah, and Conejos County, Colorado. Mormon years In 1866, Forbes married Nancy Dayton, followed by his conversion to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, to which he was committed the remainder of his life. Forbes and Dayton had thirteen children together. In their first ten years of marriage, Nancy gave birth to ten children and was deeded a farm from her stepfather. They were supported financially by his teaching and her midwifery. In 1879, Forbes married a second wife, Mary Jane Gardner, with whom he had eleven children. He devoted equal time to both wives. In 1887 with the passage of the Edmunds- Tucker Act, plural marriage became a crime, and Forbes was forced into hiding. Eventually he was arrested and detained in the penitentiary in Salt Lake City until he signed a document indicating his intention to consider himself married only to his first wife. When Mary Jane had another baby, Forbes was at risk of being arrested for cohabitation a second time. The family decided that Forbes would take Mary Jane and her children to Sanford, Colorado. About a year later, at Joseph's insistence, Nancy moved there as well. Since polygamy was not accepted there, she moved over the border to New Mexico. One of Forbes' students in Colorado was the future boxing champion Jack Dempsey. When Wilford Woodruff issued the Manifesto ending polygamy, the Forbes returned to American Fork. Forbes died in 1927 at age 87. Legacy In 1921, the citizens of American Fork honored Forbes for his long service to the community. April 15, 1921 was designated Forbes Day, and the original plan for a dinner and social event turned into a true holiday, with businesses and schools closed. Forbes and his two wives participated in a parade with the local band. Speeches were given. Forbes thanked the residents for their love and returned it, then declared the meeting his funeral: that he was now ready to die and \\"face my Maker unafraid, and with joy in my heart\\". Forbes died on May 5, 1927. The Deseret News reported in his obituary that he \\"had been a teacher for 54 years continuously, 46 years in this community [American Fork], where three generations attended his schools, a record probably unparalleled in the history of education in the west\\". Forbes established the school system in American Fork. Two schools in American Fork were named after him. In 1960, one was no longer in use. One was established in 1949. In literature Forbes' grandson Paul Dayton Bailey wrote extensively about his grandfather in Grandpa Was a Polygamist (1960), which was later reprinted as Polygamy Was Better Than Monotony (1973).

The boat made multiple non-intervention patrols during the Spanish Civil War in the late 1930s. During the Norwegian Campaign of 1940, she played a minor in the attack on Oslo, the capital of Norway. M√∂we was torpedoed and badly damaged by a British submarine in May and did not return to active service until 1942 when she was transferred to France. The boat helped to escort blockade runners, commerce raiders and submarines through the Bay of Biscay. She also laid numerous minefields and attacked Allied ships during the Invasion of Normandy in June 1944. M√∂we was sunk by British bombers that same month. Design and armament Derived from the World War 1-era large torpedo boat , the Type 23 torpedo boat was slightly larger, but had a similar armament and speed.Gr√∂ner, p. 191 The first ship to be built, M√∂we was slightly smaller than her sister ships and had an overall length of and was long at the waterline because she had a round, cruiser- style, stern rather than the transom stern of her sisters.Gr√∂ner, pp. 191‚Äì192 She had a beam of , and a mean draft of .Whitley 1991, p. 202 The boat displaced at standard load and at deep load.

They carried six above-water 50 cm (19.6 in) torpedo tubes in two triple mountsGardiner & Chesneau, p. 237 and could also carry up to 30 mines. After 1931, the torpedo tubes were replaced by tubes and a pair of C/30 anti-aircraft guns were added. During the war a quadruple 2 cm was added just forward of No. 2 gun, three 2 cm guns were positioned around the aft funnel and another pair were mounted on the bridge wings, all in single mounts.

M√∂we (the leftmost boat) can be recognized by her rounded stern. The heavy cruiser is leaving port in the right background. Named after the Seagull, the boat was laid down at the Reichsmarinewerft Wilhelmshaven (Navy Yard) on 2 March 1925.Whitley 2000, p. 57 as yard number 102,Gr√∂ner, p. 192 launched on 24 March 1926 and commissioned on 1 October 1926. The boat was initially assigned to the 4th Torpedo Boat Half Flotilla. By the end of 1936 M√∂we was assigned to the 4th Torpedo Boat Flotilla and the boat made several deployments to Spain during the Spanish Civil War. Around June 1938, she was transferred to the newly formed 5th Torpedo Boat Flotilla.Whitley 1991, pp. 77‚Äì79 =Second World War= Map of operations in Oslofjord on the night of 8/9 April, showing how far the Germans had progressed at various times as well as their movements M√∂we supported the North Sea mining operations that began on 3 September 1939.Rohwer, p. 2 During the Nowegian Campaign, the boat was assigned to Group 5 under Konteradmiral Oskar Kummetz on the heavy cruiser , tasked to capture Oslo on 9 April. M√∂we transported 114 men of the invasion force and was one of the cruiser's escorts through the Kattegat and into Oslofjord. During the Battle of Dr√∏bak Sound, the boat was in the rear of the German formation as it advanced up the fjord. After the Norwegian coast defenses crippled Bl√ºcher as she attempted to pass Oscarsborg Fortress, she was ordered to unload her troops at Son. Around 17:30 M√∂we and her sister supported the occupation of Kop√•s and Husvik batteries near Dr√∏bak. A little over an hour later, M√∂we approached the main fort under a flag of truce, and her commander, Kapit√§nleutnant (Lieutenant) Helmut Neuss, demanded that it surrender; the fort's commander, Oberst (Colonel) Birger Eriksen, dragged out the negotiations until a more senior officer was sent. The next day, the torpedo boat escorted the heavy cruiser through the Oslofjord until word was received that her sister had run aground and been wrecked. M√∂we was ordered to replace Albatros in the outer reaches of the Oslofjord. L√ºtzow continued on to Germany without any escort and was torpedoed by a British submarine later that night off the Danish coast. M√∂we and Kondor, among other ships, arrived the following morning to render assistance.Haar, pp. 84, 128, 153, 156‚Äì157, 380, 382 On 18 April, M√∂we and her sisters and escorted minelayers as they laid anti-submarine minefields in the Kattegat. Escorted by two destroyers, M√∂we, Kondor and the torpedo boat , minelayers laid another minefield in the Skaggerak on 29‚Äì30 April. En route, the torpedo boat was sunk when she was accidentally rammed by the minelayer Preussen. The following month, she was torpedoed by the British submarine on 8 May. The torpedo blew her stern off and she was under repair until October. Her stern was rebuilt in the same transom style used by her sisters.Rohwer, pp. 20, 22; Whitley 1991, p. 104 M√∂we was not fully operational until early 1942 and was transferred to France in May of that year.Whitley 2000, p. 58 In September‚ÄìOctober, M√∂we was one of the escorts for German blockade runners sailing from ports in the Bay of Biscay en route to Japan. On 3‚Äì7 May 1943, M√∂we and Greif escorted minelayers in the North Sea as they laid new minefields. From 4 to 6 June, M√∂we, Greif, Kondor, her sister and the torpedo boat laid two minefields in the English Channel. Later that month the ships return to the Bay of Biscay to help escort U-boats through the Bay and continue to do so into early August.

On 17‚Äì19 April, the 5th Torpedo Boat Flotilla, including M√∂we, Greif and Kondor sailed from Brest, France, to Cherbourg as distant cover for a convoy. A few days later, the flotilla laid a minefield on the night of 21/22 April. The following night the torpedo boats engaged British motor torpedo boats near Cape Barfleur and sank one of them. On the nights of 26/27 and 27/28 April, they laid 108 mines each night near Cherbourg. On 30 April and 1 May, the flotilla laid 260 mines in three minefields. Three weeks later, the flotilla was ordered to transfer from Cherbourg to Le Havre and departed on the night of 23/24 May. M√∂we, Greif, Falke, Kondor and Jaguar were attacked by Allied aircraft early the next day and Greif was struck by two bombs that set her forward boiler room on fire and caused her to take on water forward. With both boiler rooms subsequently flooded, she was unmaneuverable and accidentally collided with Falke. The latter was only slightly damaged, but Greifs bow was badly bent which caused problems for M√∂we when she began to tow her sister. Around 06:00 Greif lost all power and sank at 06:32. At 07:43 Kondor struck a mine and had to be towed by M√∂we for the remainder of the voyage.Rohwer, pp. 312, 317‚Äì318, 324; Whitley 1991, p. 158 As the Allies began landing in Normandy on 6 June, the 5th Flotilla, now consisting of M√∂we, Falke, Jaguar and the newly refitted large torpedo boat , sortied multiple times from Le Havre over the next week in attempts to sink Allied shipping. Despite the expenditure of over 50 torpedoes and large quantities of ammunition, they were generally unsuccessful, only sinking the destroyer on 6 June. During an air raid by the Royal Air Force on the night of 14/15 June, bombs sank Falke and Jaguar and badly damaged M√∂we.

It was also heavily promoted by the owners of local collieries, of these people were brothers James Bateman and John Bateman and the mayor of Congleton. Construction of the line began on 27 April 1858 and was built by the North Staffordshire Railway who were responsible for opening of other lines in the surrounding areas of Staffordshire. The line opened in sections to mineral traffic with the first part opening to Childerplay and then in 1859, following another act of parliament along with an additional ¬£35,000. The remaining 4 1/2 miles of track were laid for mineral traffic, opening in 1860. Stations opened along the line in 1864. The stations at Ford Green & Smallthorne, Black Bull and Biddulph opened on the same day, 1 June 1864. Subsequently halts at Chell, Knypersley and Mossley opened between 1890 and 1919. The line was also linked to the Stoke‚ÄìLeek line which ran to Leek and connected to the same junction as the Churnet Valley Line (Uttoxeter-Leek-Macclesfield) and the Waterhouses branch line. Decline The stations along the line closed to passengers in 1927 due to poor usage while the halts closed earlier between 1923 and 1927. Freight traffic, mainly coal, continued. Closure came in stages; Congleton Upper junction to Congleton Lower junction closed on 1 December 1963 and all long distance traffic to Congleton Brunswick Wharf then had to come via Stoke. Brunswick Wharf to Heath junction followed on 15 January 1969 and then Heath junction to Ford Green when rail traffic ceased at Victoria colliery in January 1976. The last section from Ford Green to Milton junction was taken out of use on the closure of Norton colliery in June 1977. The stations (except Biddulph) were demolished after closure and the track was lifted from Bucknall and Northwood to the junction near Congleton. Present day The line from Stoke-on-Trent to Bucknall and Northwood remained in use for stone traffic to and from Oakamoor and Caldon where they served the sand sidings and the quarries but the line was mothballed in 1988 as a result. The line from Ford Green and Smallthorne to Mossley via Biddulph now forms the Biddulph Valley Way and is used by cyclists and walkers. It follows the course of the entire line.

Set on a dystopian sci-fi future in the year 2110, where the fictional city of Meggagrid has been overrun by criminals and industries, the player is equipped with a flight suit created by scientist Dr. Franz Grubert known as the HeliPak in an attempt to overthrow the main criminal organization led by the Pitt family and bring order back to the metropolis. Its gameplay mainly consists of shooting action in third-person with six degrees of freedom using a main five-button configuration. Headed by Electronic Arts and The 3DO Company founder Trip Hawkins alongside Gregory A. Gorsiski and Robert Lindsey, Blade Force was created by most of the same team that were previously involved with several projects at Studio 3DO such as Jurassic Park Interactive and features a 3D game engine created by Pinball Construction Set designer Bill Budge. Blade Force has been met with mostly positive reception from video game magazines and other dedicated outlets that reviewed the game since its launch, with praise towards the presentation, texture-mapped polygon graphics and sound design, though some reviewers criticized other aspects of the title such as the gameplay.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot. Blade Force is a third- person shooter simulation game similar to Descent, where players are equipped with the HeliPak flight suit and must traverse through seven areas set in the futuristic 3D urban landscape of Meggagrid featuring six degrees of freedom to overthrow the criminal organization led by the Pitt family and bring order back to the metropolis as the main objective.Blade Force manual (3DO Interactive Multiplayer, US) Before the main missions, players are introduced to a tutorial area by Dr. Franz Grubert in order to get familiarized with the controls and beneficial items that can be picked up along the way. After the tutorial is completed, players are tasked with various objectives to clear before proceeding such as capturing a designated criminal. If the players does not recover health, their player character will burst in flames and crash into the ground by enemy fire and once all lives are lost, the game is over, though players have the option of resuming progress by loading their saved game into the last mission reached.  Synopsis  Blade Force takes place in the year 2110, where a fictional metropolis built from the ruins of Los Angeles called Meggagrid has been overrun by criminals and industries. Scientist Dr. Franz Grubert had previously proposed a plan two years ago to equip the city's police force with a flight suit known as the HeliPak, however the government decided reducing the prison sentence to two years, cut funding for the remaining mental health centers and rely on aerial counter-terrorism squads as a cost-effective measure to control the increasing crime statistics. Due to corruption at the city hall, the city council did not adopt the proposed equipment and cut funds for Dr. Grubert, who was later permanently crippled during a bombing procedure. Seeking revenge against his enemies, Grubert plotted a plan to overthrow the main criminal organization led by the Pitt family, as the players are equipped with the HeliPak suit to carry on the mission.  Development and release  Blade Force for the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer features a 3D game engine by Bill Budge. Blade Force was created by most of the same team that were previously involved with several projects at Studio 3DO such as Jurassic Park Interactive. Its development was helmed by Electronic Arts and The 3DO Company founder Trip Hawkins, alongside producers Gregory A. Gorsiski and Robert Lindsey, with Gorsiski also sharing the role of designer, director and writer with multiple members of the staff. Frank Sandoval served as project's sole programmer, while artists Paul Xander, Rebecca Chow and Vince Arroyo were responsible for the artwork. The soundtrack was written by composer Nick Lockwood, while Jeff Sutherland handled the sound design. Other members of the staff collaborated in its development including Pinball Construction Set designer Bill Budge, who created the 3D game engine. The game runs at 30 frames per second. Blade Force was published by The 3DO Company across North America, Europe and Japan in 1995. Early previews prior to release showcased at events like E3 1995 featured several differences such as a different head-up display and gameplay perspective compared to the final game. Although the title was rated 17 in western regions, the Japanese release was rated E instead.  Reception  Next Generation reviewed the 3DO version of the game, rating it five stars out of five, and stated that \\"This is easily one of the best games ever made, for 3DO or any system.\\"  References   External links  * Blade Force at GameFAQs * Blade Force at Giant Bomb * Blade Force at MobyGames Category:1995 video games Category:3DO Interactive Multiplayer games Category:3DO Interactive Multiplayer-only games Category:Flight simulation video games Category:Science fiction video games Category:Single-player video games Category:Third-person shooters Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games set in Los Angeles Category:Video games set in the 22nd century Category:Video games set in the future Category:Video games set in the United States Category:Video games with 6 degrees of freedom ","title":"Blade Force"},{"id":"58066296","text":"Yudai Arashiro (born 3 July 1995) is a Japanese cyclist, who currently rides for UCI Continental team .

Biology Letters. 14 (8): 20180130. It includes one species, Paludidraco multidentatus. Paludidraco is thought to possibly have been a filter-feeding marine reptile, and was about 2.5 metres long. The fossils, one relatively complete skull and partial postcranial skeleton and one partial skull and mandibles, were found in the El Atance site in Guadalajara, Central Spain at the Keuper Facies horizon, the border of the Carnian and Norian periods of the Triassic.  Features  Paludidraco was similar to its close relative Simosaurus, but differed in several important respects. The teeth were pleurodont and it had more than 15 premaxillary teeth, hence the species name multidentatus meaning 'many-toothed'. It had a relatively long snout, but the nostrils were higher up on its head than those of Simosaurus. The upper temporal fenestra is narrow, and the pineal foramen is highly elongated. The supraoccipital is horizontally sutured with the parietal and exposed at the posterior end of the parietal table. The jaws are very slender and fragile, quite bowed, and with the teeth situated laterally. There are very many teeth, all small, recurved and flattened sideways. The vertebral centra are amphicoelous and the zygapophyses are pachyostotic. The ribs are pachyostotic and strongly distally expanded.  Palaeoecology  Paludidraco, like all nothosaurs, would have been mainly aquatic but able to come on land for short periods. It would not have been able to capture live prey, as its jaws were too fragile except for very small animals which could offer no resistance, and its robust pachyostotic postcranial skeleton would have made it unmanoeuvrable. Its many small teeth create a comb-like structure which would be suitable for filter-feeding, and its bowed jaws could have taken in large volumes of water for filtering, but it did not have an especially elongated rostrum or very large jaws, as modern baleen whales do, suggesting that it would have been unable to 'suspension feed' in midwater with shoals of crustaceans or plankton. Paludidraco's small teeth and weak jaws would probably have also been inadequate for eating many marine plants, but it might have been able to scrape off soft vegetable matter from plants on the sea floor. The pachyostotic skeleton, similar to that seen in modern sirenians, would have made Paludidraco slow and unmanoeuvrable, but would have given it neutral buoyancy and so enabled it to hover near the sea floor while expending very little energy. It has therefore been proposed that Paludidraco swam slowly along the seabed, or possibly even walked along it, eating soft vegetable matter. Alternatively, it could have taken mouthfuls of silt or sand from the seabed and shaken its head from side to side to filter out the small crustaceans or worms living in the sediment, in a similar way to modern grey whales. This would explain its apparent ability to filter but not to 'suspension feed', while the pachyostotic skeleton would have made this a very low-energy lifestyle. It is also possible that it could have eaten both vegetable and animal matter in the ways proposed.

He became an early supporter of Philippine president Ferdinand Marcos, who tapped him as a \\"financial advisor.\\" In 1986, the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) cited him for having served as a \\"front man\\" for various \\"ill-gotten\\" wealth, including $52.5 million of real estate representing the most prominent Marcos Mansions. He became the first of the Marcos cronies to make a deal with the PCGG in exchange for immunity from suit. By the time he died in 2016, his family had become one of the Philippines' most powerful business clans, with UNILAB helmed by his firstborn, Joy Campos Hess and her son, Clinton Hess. His eldest son Jos√©lito Campos founded condiments company Nutri-Asia and acquired in Del Monte Philippines and Del Monte Pacific; and his youngest child Jeffrey Campos running Greenfields Development Corporation.  Early life and move to the Philippines  Yao Campos was born Yao Cho Diat in Ha-ngo-po, a village in Jinjing Town, Jinjiang, part of modern-day Quanzhou, China. He lived there as a youth and was educated in the Chinese classics until he was old enough to be accepted for admission to the Whampoa Military Academy established by Sun Yat- sen‚Äîan honor which he described as \\"the ultimate dream of all patriotic Chinese boys.\\" Instead of allowing him to attend the academy, however, his father sent Yao to Quezon province in the Philippines, where he would learn business skills from his older brother Yao Shiong Shio, who was already a successful trader. Yao Campos started out as a worker at his brother's buntal hat business before the war, and survived the Second World War by making his living as a buy-and-sell trader. He eventually adopted the name \\"Jos√© Yao Campos\\" as his Filipino name.  Foundation of UNILAB  Soon after the end of World War II in 1945, Yao Campos partnered with Mariano K. Tan to build a drugstore on Sto. Cristo Street in Binondo, Manila. (Some sources also mention an American soldier named Robert Horowitz as Yao Campos' partner in charge of production when the drugstore was first built.) Describing the beginnings of the company, Yao Campos' brother-in-law and later UNILAB president Howard Q. Dee later recounted: > \\"Unilab started with humble beginnings as a small manufacturing enterprise. > Our offices and modest production facilities were located in JY‚Äôs > residential compound in Santa Mesa. We literally began as a home industry > with no more than 30 employees. With the new monetary policies, in no time, > a dozen foreign pharmaceutical companies established large manufacturing > facilities. Unilab was the smallest but under the leadership of JY, we > developed a game plan like no other. Our strategic planning showed us the > way to segment the pharma market with a multi-divisional approach that would > enable us to compete on all fronts. The keys were product sourcing and > planning, synergism in promotions and distribution outreach.\\" By 1959, after only fourteen years in operation, Yao Campos and Tan, with the help of Yao Campos' brother-in-law Dee, had transformed United Drug into United Laboratories, with the highest share of the Philippine pharmaceuticals market among all the Philippines' local drug manufacturers. This was attributed to the values Yao Campos was said to have instilled in the company, which admirers described as \\"the Confucian values of hard work, frugality, discipline, perseverance, filial piety to parents and ancestors, love of education and delayed personal gratification.\\" Under Yao Campos, UNILAB remained a proudly non-unionized company, with a company-initiated Employee Board providing benefits to employees instead of a union negotiating with the company on their behalf. Unionization was so much of ‚Äúa no-no to the owners‚Äù of UNILAB that they went as far as to hire a feng shui expert to redesign their corporate headquarters in response to a 1996 incident in which union organizers nearly succeeded in forming a union.  Early support of Ferdinand Marcos  Yao Campos was an early supporter of Ferdinand Marcos, making campaign contributions as early as Marcos‚Äô first congressional run in 1946. He would eventually become one of the closest among Marcos‚Äô cronies, along with Danding Cojuangco and Roberto Benedicto. Although critics of the Marcos administration would later note that Marcos‚Äô cronies managed to make huge fortunes despite not being known as particularly good businessmen, Yao Campos and Rolando Gapud were often considered the notable exceptions, because of their established business record prior to Marcos‚Äô presidency. Nevertheless, Marcos‚Äô stint in the legislature allowed him to favor Yao Campos‚Äô business. Having won as congressman, Marcos was soon made chairman of the House Committee on Commerce and Industry. When he won a seat in the senate later, he became a member of the Senate Special Committee on Import and Price Controls and on Reparations. This allowed Marcos to make his fortune by selling import licenses to businessmen. His campaign benefactor Yao Campos‚Äô company UNILAB was granted exclusive import licences in the Pharmaceuticals industry. Because UNILAB's market dominance turned it into a major supplier of pharmaceuticals for government health programs, Yao Campos found another way to help build up Ferdinand Marcos during campaigns: by supplying the government with medicine packs branded ‚ÄúMedical Assistance to Rural Communities and Other Sectors‚Äù ‚Äì the acronym for which spelled out ‚ÄúM.A.R.C.O.S.‚Äù Marcos eventually asked Yao Campos to become godfather to both Imee and Bongbong Marcos.  \\"Front man\\" for the Marcoses  As an early supporter of Marcos, Yao Campos became a financial advisor to the president. While it was Roberto Benedicto who helped the Marcoses open a Swiss bank account under the fictitious names \\"William Saunders\\" and \\"Jane Ryan\\", it was Yao Campos who organized 40 different shell companies through whose bank accounts the Marcoses could later transfer the Saunders account money, giving them multiple additional layers beneath which to hide their identity. He also served as the Marcoses' \\"front man for various assets and properties. The most widely publicized of these properties include the most prominent Marcos mansions‚Äîover P2.5 billion ($52.5 million) worth in real estate located in Metro Manila, Rizal, Laguna, Cavite, Bataan and Baguio.  Cooperation with the PCGG  Yao Campos was in Canada in 1986 PHILIPPINES SEIZES A BIG CORPORATION By SETH MYDANS and SPECIAL TO THE NEW YORK TIMES when Corazon Aquino‚Äôs Revolutionary Government took over the Philippines after the Marcoses were deposed by the EDSA revolution. He was the first among the Marcos cronies to make a deal with the Aquino government in exchange for immunity from suit, and the deal he struck with the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) was one of the agency‚Äôs earliest successes. The 1986 settlement involved PhP 250 million in cash and PhP 2.5 billion worth of titles to 197 properties in Metro Manila, Rizal, Laguna, Cavite, Bataan, and Baguio‚Äîall of which Yao Campos admitted were under his name but actually part of the ill-gotten wealth of Ferdinand Marcos. It also included a building on Efipanio de Los Santos Avenue (EDSA) where Imee Marcos had an office before the EDSA revolution, which eventually became the headquarters of the PCGG. In 2007, the Marcos family confirmed that the properties surrendered by Yao Campos to the PCGG in 1986 were indeed owned by Ferdinand Marcos, arguing that Yao Campos should not have surrendered them to the government because ‚Äúunder a constructive trust in favor of the estate of the former president.‚Äù  Later life, death, and family empire  After the People Power Revolution, Yao Campos earned a reputation as the most media-shy of all the Philippines‚Äô taipans. By the time Yao Campos died on May 1, 2016, UNILAB had become the Philippines‚Äô largest drug-manufacturing company. UNILAB is currently headed by his eldest child, Joy Campos Hess, and her son, Clinton Hess. His sons have also become dominant forces in their own industries, making the family one of the Philippines‚Äô most powerful business clans. His eldest son, Joselito D. Yao Campos, founded the condiments company NutriAsia, and is now also vice chairman of Del Monte Philippines, and chairman of Fort Bonifacio Development Corporation. Another Yao Campos son, Jeffrey D. Yao Campos, runs the real estate holdings company Greenfield Development Corporation.

The South African National Spatial Biodiversity Assessment of 2011 amended this to reduce the number of regions to four inshore and two offshore and rename them as ecoregions. The exclusive economic zone Sea areas in international rights An exclusive economic zone (EEZ) is a sea zone prescribed by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea over which a state has special rights regarding the exploration and use of marine resources, including energy production from water and wind. It stretches from the baseline out to 200 nautical miles (nmi) from its coast. The term does not generally include either the territorial sea or the continental shelf beyond the 200 nmi limit. but in this context territorial waters are included. The difference between the territorial sea and the exclusive economic zone is that the first confers full sovereignty over the waters, whereas the second is merely a \\"sovereign right\\" which refers to the coastal state's rights below the surface of the sea. The surface waters of the EEZ beyond territorial waters are international waters. History The first mapping of South African marine habitats was done in a series of workshops led by the NSBA marine team culminating in a marine biodiversity assessment report in of the South African National Spatial Biodiversity Assessment of 2004. This indicated 34 marine biozones extending from the supratidal zone to the border of the exclusive economic zone. They allow for future refinement where necessary. Nine South African marine bioregions were defined in the South African National Spatial Biodiversity Assessment (NSBA) 2004. The five inshore bioregions of 2004 were consolidated to four in the 2011 assessment. The Namaqua and southwestern Cape inshore bioregions became the southern Benguela shelf ecoregion. Similarly the Indo-Pacific offshore bioregion, the South-west Indian offshore bioregion, and the West Indian offshore bioregion were combined to become the Southwest Indian ecoregion, reducing the four offshore bioregions to two deepsea ecoregions. The other bioregions were renamed to ecoregions. The resulting regions are: Benguela, Agulhas, Natal, and Delagoa ecoregions, which include the coast, continental shelf and shelf edge, and the Southeast Atlantic and Southwest Indian ecoregions include the upper and lower continental slope and abyssal regions. The regions =Depth zones= The regions are divided into benthic depth zones. Along the coastline there are supratidal, above the high-water mark, intertidal between high and low water, shallow photic, or subtidal shoreface, where there is turbulence and enough light for seaweeds to flourish, down to about 10 m, deep photic, where there is less light, down to about 30 m, and sub-photic (lightless) zones, down to the edge of the continental shelf, which varies from about 400 m in the northern part of the west coast, to 200 m in the Agulhas region, 100 m off Natal, and can be shallow as 50 m in the Delagoa bioregion. The shelf break is defined by the slope angle of the seabed. The offshore regions include upper slope, from the shelf break down to about 1800 m, lower slope, and abyss, below 3500 m. The end boundaries of the supratidal zone do not generally coincide with the bioregion boundaries. =Inshore regions= Five inshore marine bioregions that extend from the shoreline to the break of the continental shelf were defined. Boundaries between them are difficult to define, and overlaps between regions are accepted, because available species data may indicate large sections of coast with few endemics, and many species are found spread across more than one region. West coast ;Benguela ecoregion: :This is the region comprising the consolidated Namaqua and South- western Cape bioregions. ; Namaqua bioregion: :This is a cool temperate region between Sylvia Hill just north of L√ºderitz in Namibia to Cape Columbine. Sylvia Hill is the northern boundary of a large upwelling cell. The bioregion has large-scale intensive upwelling and nutrient rich water, and the cold Benguela current. The region is known for low oxygen events and it contains extensive mud banks and a relatively wide continental shelf. It is a productive bioregion and supports major commercial fisheries. In the 2011 assessment it was combined with the South-western Cape bioregion to form the Benguela ecoregion. ; South-western Cape region: : This region has a relatively narrow continental shelf. There is a change in geology at Cape Columbine which marks the northern extent of the exposed granite, and there is less offshore mud habitat south of this break. This region includes the two underwater canyons, Cape Point Valley and Cape Canyon, and there are large areas of rocky reef. The change in biology at Cape Columbine is indicated by change in seaweed and intertidal communities. There is less tendency for oxygen deficient bottom water than in the area further north. This region supports trawl and longline fisheries for hake, pelagic fisheries for anchovy, pilchard and roundherring, and a longline shark fishery. The break at the south-eastern end of the region is at Cape Point, where it is distinct in the inshore and tidal habitats, but the change in deeper water tends obliquely to the south-east, and is more diffuse, due to mixing of the Benguela and Agulhas currents between these regions. In the 2011 assessment it was combined with the Namaqua bioregion to form the Benguela ecoregion. South coast ; Agulhas region: : The region from Cape Point to the Mbashe river is known as the Agulhas bioregion. The south coast comprises a warm temperate component from Mbashe to Cape Agulhas, and a large overlap zone between Cape Agulhas and Cape Point where waters of the two currents mix. The continental shelf is at its widest in this region, extending up to 240km offshore on the Agulhas Bank. The shelf edge includes areas of extensive slumping. There are several areas of reef on the Agulhas Bank, including the Alphard banks. This region has the highest number of South African endemics, and is a breeding area for many species. There are several important commercial fisheries including squid, horse mackerel, shark, and lobster. It was renamed to Agulhas ecoregion in the 2011 assessment. East coast ; Natal region: : The Natal bioregion, from the Mbashe River in the south-west to Cape Vidal in the north, is characterised by a narrow continental shelf, with widths ranging from less than five km to a maximum of 50 km off the Tugela bank. This region has high riverine input and includes the Thukela river, which is the largest river system in KwaZulu-Natal. The oceanographic driving force of this bioregion is the Agulhas Current, with strong influence north of Cape St Lucia and south of Port Shepstone where the shelf is narrowest. In the Natal bight, south of Cape St Lucia, where the coastline is more distant from the shelf edge, there is a dynamically driven upwelling cell which is an important source of nutrients for the Tugela Bank. A cyclonic eddy near Durban sometimes causes a northward current to flow between Aliwal Shoal and Ballito. The submarine canyons in the Natal bioregion include the Tugela and Goodlad canyons in the north and several others between Port Shepstone and Port St Johns. Reefs occur mainly in the southern and central areas within this bioregion and there is an important deep reef complex along most of this coastline. A commercial line fishery largely based on surf-launched vessels is important in this region, and the annual sardine run occurs in the southern coastal waters. Limited reef habitat is represented by the major complexes at Protea banks and Aliwal shoal. Biological communities of the rocky reefs in this region are different from the coral communities further north, as reef-building Indo-Pacific corals decline with the increased turbidity in the southern waters and are replaced by endemic soft corals. There are major estuarine systems including Durban Bay, Richards Bay and the St Lucia system, and the Tugela mud banks are the only mud belt on the east coast, with unique biotic assemblages. They support prawn fisheries offshore and are nursery areas for elasmobranchs and bony fish. It was renamed to Natal ecoregion in the 2011 assessment. ; Delagoa region: : The Delagoa bioregion from Inhaca to Cape Vidal has a narrow continental shelf, a shallow steep shelf break and a large number of submarine canyons. The warm Agulhas current is a dominant feature. It flows strongly southward along the shelf. There is little riverine inflow, so the water remains clear and the reefs are colonised by scleractinian corals. The sediments are medium to fine grained sands and carbonate rich gravel and rubble. Nesting beaches of leatherback and loggerhead turtles can be found. The coastline includes occasional bays with rocky headlands, and long sandy beaches. There are no commercial fisheries in the South African part of this bioregion. It was renamed to Delagoa ecoregion in the 2011 assessment. =Offshore= A further four offshore bioregions extending from the break of the continental shelf to the border of the EEZ were defined in the 2004 assessment. The offshore bioregions were defined based on the assumption that the marine biota of the deeper waters is more homogeneous than on the continental shelf, as the deeper water has more consistent temperature. This results in a smaller number of offshore bioregions. In most cases the boundary between bioregions was chosen as a straight line perpendicular to the coast, except for the break at Cape Point, which runs due south to the 30 m isobath then follows the 150 m isobath to 21¬∞East. This approximates the line of the mixing zone between the Benguela and Agulhas currents, which separates their fish communities. This line divides the Agulhas bank into a western part which is considered part of the South-western Cape bioregion, and an eastern part which is in the Agulhas bioregion. The Cape Point break is extended south over the shelf break, down to the abyss and to the border of the EEZ. The region to the west of this break is the Atlantic Offshore bioregion, which is offshore of both the Namaqua and South-western Cape inshore regions. To the east of this break, the West Indian offshore bioregion comprises the upper and lower continental slope as far north-east as the Cape Vidal break. The abyssal region below this part of the slope is designated as the Indo-Pacific offshore bioregion. North of the Cape Vidal break, the slope is designated as the South-west Indian offshore bioregion. There is no abyssal region within the EEZ this far north. The three offshore bioregions east of Cape Agulhas were combined in the 2011 assessment. Habitat types The following marine habitat types have been identified as ecologically distinct. *Agulhas boulder shore *Agulhas canyon *Agulhas dissipative sandy coast *Agulhas dissipative- intermediate sandy coast *Agulhas estuarine shore *Agulhas exposed rocky coast *Agulhas gravel inner shelf *Agulhas gravel outer shelf *Agulhas gravel shelf edge *Agulhas hard inner shelf *Agulhas hard outer shelf *Agulhas hard shelf edge *Agulhas inshore gravel *Agulhas inshore hard grounds *Agulhas inshore reef *Agulhas intermediate sandy coast *Agulhas island *Agulhas mixed sediment inner shelf *Agulhas mixed sediment outer shelf *Agulhas mixed shore *Agulhas muddy inner shelf *Agulhas muddy outer shelf *Agulhas muddy shelf edge *Agulhas outer shelf reef *Agulhas reflective sandy coast *Agulhas sandy inner shelf *Agulhas sandy inshore *Agulhas sandy outer shelf *Agulhas sandy shelf edge *Agulhas shelf edge reef *Agulhas sheltered rocky coast *Agulhas very exposed rocky coast *Delagoa canyon *Delagoa inshore reef *Delagoa mixed shore *Delagoa sandy inshore *Delagoa sandy shelf *Delagoa sandy shelf edge *Delagoa shelf edge reef *Delagoa shelf reef *Delagoa very exposed rocky coast *Harbour *Namaqua boulder shore *Namaqua exposed rocky coast *Namaqua hard inner shelf *Namaqua inner shelf reef *Namaqua inshore hard grounds *Namaqua inshore reef *Namaqua island *Namaqua mixed shore *Namaqua muddy inner shelf *Namaqua muddy inshore *Namaqua sandy inner shelf *Namaqua sandy inshore *Namaqua sheltered rocky coast *Namaqua very exposed rocky coast *Natal boulder shore *Natal canyon *Natal estuarine shore *Natal exposed rocky coast *Natal gravel shelf *Natal gravel shelf edge *Natal inshore gravel *Natal inshore reef *Natal mixed sediment shelf *Natal mixed sediment shelf edge *Natal mixed shore *Natal muddy inshore *Natal muddy shelf *Natal muddy shelf edge *Natal sandy inshore *Natal sandy shelf *Natal sandy shelf edge *Natal shelf edge *Natal shelf edge reef *Natal very exposed rocky coast *Natal-Delagoa dissipative sandy coast *Natal-Delagoa dissipative-intermediate sandy coast *Natal-Delagoa estuarine shore *Natal-Delagoa intermediate sandy coast *Natal-Delagoa reflective sandy coast *South Atlantic abyss *South Atlantic abyss with ferro- manganese deposits *South Atlantic lower bathyal *South Atlantic upper bathyal *Southeast Atlantic seamounts *Southern Benguela canyon *Southern Benguela carbonate mound *Southern Benguela dissipative sandy coast *Southern Benguela dissipative-intermediate sandy coast *Southern Benguela estuarine shore *Southern Benguela gravel outer shelf *Southern Benguela gravel shelf edge *Southern Benguela hard outer shelf *Southern Benguela hard shelf edge *Southern Benguela intermediate sandy coast *Southern Benguela muddy outer shelf *Southern Benguela muddy shelf edge *Southern Benguela outer shelf reef *Southern Benguela reflective sandy coast *Southern Benguela sandy outer shelf *Southern Benguela sandy shelf edge *Southwest Indian abyss *Southwest Indian abyss with ferro-manganese deposits *Southwest Indian lower bathyal *Southwest Indian lower bathyal with ferro-manganese deposits *Southwest Indian seamounts *Southwest Indian upper bathyal *Southwestern Cape boulder shore *Southwestern Cape exposed rocky coast *Southwestern Cape hard inner shelf *Southwestern Cape inshore hard grounds *Southwestern Cape inshore reef *Southwestern Cape island *Southwestern Cape lagoon *Southwestern Cape mixed shore *Southwestern Cape sandy inner shelf *Southwestern Cape sandy inshore *Southwestern Cape sheltered rocky coast *Southwestern Cape very exposed rocky coast The classification of South African marine and coastal habitat types takes connectivity, depth and slope, substrate geology and sediment grain size, shoreline wave exposure, and biogeography into account. Beach state considers the wave exposure and grain size. 136 habitat types are identified. The categories and number of types of habitat identified in each category are: * 37 coastal habitat types: ** 16 types of rocky coast ** 5 types of mixed coast ** 16 types of sandy coast * 1 type of lagoon * 3 types of island * 17 inshore habitat types in the 5 to 30 m depth range: ** 8 types of rocky inshore benthos ** 9 types of unconsolidated sedimentary inshore benthos * 62 offshore benthic habitat types deeper than 30 m: ** 12 types of rocky continental shelf benthos ** 19 types of unconsolidated continental shelf ** 9 types of rocky continental shelf edge ** 11 types of unconsolidated sedimentary continental shelf edge ** 2 types of seamount ** 9 types of deep sea sedimentary bottom * 16 types of offshore pelagic habitat Conservation status As of 2011, of 136 identified marine and coastal habitat types, 47% are threatened, 17% are critically endangered, 7% are endangered, and 23% are vulnerable - more than 70% of the South African marine and coastal area is threatened to some extent Threatened habitat types tend to be of limited size, more coastal habitat types than offshore are threatened, and benthic habitats are more threatened than pelagic habitats in the offshore environment.The habitats associated with islands and rocky shelf edges are all threatened. Of the coastal habutats, many in the former Namaqualand and Southwestern Cape bioregions (now Benguela ecoregion) are threatened, while in the offshore bioregions, the most threatened habitat types are in the southern Benguela and Agulhas regions. =Protection= As of 2011, 54 (40%) of the listed marine and coastal habitat types were not represented in the South African marine protected areas, and therefore had no legal protection. Most of these were offshore, as most of the existing protected areas extend only a short distance from the coastline, and 13 of these are critically endangered. 6% of marine and coastal habitats are well protected, more in the coastal and inshore regions than offshore, and most coastal habitats are only moderately protected, as in many marine protected areas there is insufficient no-take zone area, so protection from fishing is limited. Only 4% of offshore habitat types were well protected. The range of protected habitat types was increased considerably by the proclamation of several offshore marine protected areas in late 2018. =Threats= The greatest identified impact on marine biodiversity is fishing, including poaching, which additionally threatens the livelihoods of legitimate fishers. The structure of the government departments responsible for fisheries and ecological management is inefficient. A further pressure on the coastal waters is coastal development, which has the greatest impact on coastal biodiversity. Along with climate change, inappropriate coastal development threatens the coastal habitats and their ecological processes. The reduction of freshwater flow from rivers due to dams and other use impacts marine, coastal and particularly estuarine ecosystems. About 40% of the flow from the largest catchments no longer reaches the estuaries, and this can have disruptive effects to the local ecological processes such as nursery functions. These effects are most severe on the east coast, and have been linked to linefish stock abundance more than 40km offshore. Most marine resources for which statistics are available are over-exploited and a significant number of species are threatened by this. The increase in invasive alien species is also a significant ecological threat. The mechanisms of introduction include shipping, mariculture and petroleum extraction activities. Observed climate change has already affected the ecological, fisheries, and resource management and has further socio-economic implications. The uncertainty of climate change trends makes the impacts difficult to predict, which increases the complexity of research and management.

As the original house resembled a defensive bunker with barred windows, there is a possibility that it was constructed in the late 1830s when there was some concern for safety of the settlers.John E Deacon: A Survey of the Historical Development of the Avon Valley with Particular Reference to York, Western Australia During the Years 1830-1850, UWA, 1948. It was occupied at least by the end of 1844. The house comprised a single-storey bond store with a residence, built into the side of the hill. It was constructed of stone quarried from the other side of Grey Street. Sheoak shingles were the original roof covering. The original home had five rooms; two bedrooms, kitchen, vestibule and a large storeroom with a wide door suitable for barrels. It had only one entrance and all windows were barred.  Two storey addition (second stage - construction 1849 to 1851)  Two storeys were added to the first stage in the second stage, leaving the first stage as a cellar. The completion of this stage involved convict labour. This stage was completed before January 1852. The house with the additional two storeys is one of the buildings shown in the engraving of York in The Illustrated London News of 28 February 1857, based on a drawing by Edmund Henderson.  Wings added (third stage - 1868Wilson, H., Avon Valley Sketchbook, Rigby, Perth, 1977)  After the death of John Henry Monger Snr in 1867, his son John Henry Monger Jnr extended Faversham House.Inquirer and Commercial News 27 May 1868, p.3, assuming the article incorrectly shows his name. These additions included the two gabled wings north and south of the central section, verandahs, white railed balconies and high gabled turrets. The new north wing consisted of a large billiards room with bedrooms above; the new south wing contained a large dining room with nurseries and a nanny's room above.  Fourth stage (1907)  On the death of John Henry Monger Jnr in 1892, Faversham House was inherited by his eldest son, Alexander J Monger. The property was leased out for a number of years while Alexander Monger attended to business in London. In 1903, Alexander Monger returned from London with intentions of selling the property. However, after marrying Florence McCracken in 1906, he decided to restore the house. Servants quarters were added. A wing running east and west on the southern end of the house was also built, providing a kitchen and staff dining room. Additions were built with locally produced bricks.  20th century  Mr & Mrs Alexander Monger lived in the house for the next thirty years. During their residence, Faversham House was a focal point for social events and business meetings. At the beginning of World War Two, Mrs Monger presented Faversham House to the Australian Government and the Red Cross.The Australian Women's Weekly, 28 August 1943 During the war, Faversham House was used as a hospital and convalescent home for servicemen.

Newton said in a statement that the project \\"has the capacity to challenge entrenched attitudes on a topic that has inspired visceral reactions for almost a generation.\\" Several people from the sports and political spectrums lent their support for the project such as former NBA player Bo Kimble, former NFL player Rosey Grier, former Texas state senator Rodney Ellis, and former U.S. Representative for California's 33rd congressional district Diane Watson, one of the film's associate producers and an inspirational force behind the project. Watson was good friends with Johnnie Cochran and said at a 2016 town hall meeting, about Cochran's portrayal in The People v. O. J. Simpson, \\"(he) comes across as undignified, unlikable, and obsessed with using the race card to secure an acquittal ‚Äì but that's not how he was and that's not what happened. The jury gave their verdict based on the evidence ‚Äì nothing else. And if anyone wants to say differently I suggest they read the actual trial transcripts. There has been a massive misrepresentation of the truth, but fortunately things are about to change and the truth is about to come out.\\" Principal photography began in February 2018 and took place in Bulgaria, instead of Los Angeles, where the murders and trial occurred. \\"The reason we shot in Bulgaria was because we reconstructed O.J.'s house on Rockingham and Nicole's house on Bundy and Mezzaluna, those places don't exist anymore.\\" Steve Small, one of the film's producers, said. \\"It's the first time you'll see O.J.'s house inside and out.\\" The film was due for release in summer 2014 under the title \\"An American Mystery\\", with a proposed budget of $65 million‚ÄòAn American Mystery,‚Äô A Whodunit Film About O.J.

It is situated in the Mount Skokomish Wilderness on land managed by Olympic National Forest. The mountain's name honors General of the Armies John J. Pershing. Its nearest higher peak is Mount Washington at to the south-southeast. Precipitation runoff drains into the Hamma Hamma River. Geology The Olympic Mountains are composed of obducted clastic wedge material and oceanic crust, primarily Eocene sandstone, turbidite, and basaltic oceanic crust. The mountains were sculpted during the Pleistocene era by erosion and glaciers advancing and retreating multiple times. Climate Mount Pershing seen from the north Mount Pershing is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Olympic Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Olympic Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall (Orographic lift). As a result, the Olympics experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger.

He was an environmentalist, conservationist and philanthropist. He was the founder of Haslemere Estates, a London-based development company that spearheaded, against the grain of the time (1958-1984), restoring existing buildings rather than demolishing and making way for glass and concrete edifices at much greater environmental cost. His philanthropic activities include the founding of two charitable trusts; The Cleary Foundation (1953) and The Bay Trust (1969), an environmental education charity. Within the City of London he gained the pseudonym 'Flowering Fred' for his philanthropic activity in establishing, maintaining and enhancing over 150 green spaces in inner London. He was the author of three books Beauty and the Borough, I'll Do it Yesterday and The Flowering City.  Early life  Born 11 April 1905, in Hampstead, London, Cleary was the son of an electrical engineer. He attended Owen's School, North London and qualified as a Chartered Surveyor at the Northern Polytechnic, Holloway in 1929. Cleary was married to Norah and had two daughters, Pauline (1931 - 2011) and Patricia (1938-Present).  Wartime career  The role of Chartered Surveyor was a reserved occupation during the war and Cleary also contributed to the war effort in London as an ARP Warden. During this time he worked at The London Investment & Mortgage Company as a Chartered Surveyor.  Post-war career Following the war Cleary co-founded the City & Metropolitan Building Society and remained its Chairman for the subsequent 30 years. He also joined Hornsey Council. One example of this work included The Grove Lodge Gardens in Muswell Hill. In 1949, Cleary and the Town Clerk managed to buy the land for Haringey Council and turned it into a little park. Grove Lodge Gardens featured in his book Beauty and the Borough. In this Cleary writes: > ‚ÄúThe fence has gone, revealing the full beauty of very fine trees. The > opportunities and the natural beauty of the site have been well used by > intelligent planning and artistic garden designing.‚Äù Environmentally focused in his work at Hornsey Borough Council, Cleary encouraged recycling. In his autobiography I‚Äôll do it yesterday he writes about what people refer to as waste and the efforts of residents in Hornsey Borough to continue to salvage, repurpose and recycle as much as they can. > I pointed out that in the financial year 1950-51 alone, the 100,000 > residents in Hornsey Borough had salvaged 1,550 tons of paper, 1,529 tons of > kitchen waste, and 436 tons of metal and other items. Had it not been for > the Borough's tremendous efforts during the salvage drive, the Council's > estimates would have been exceeded by more than five thousand pounds. Cleary founded the Cleary Foundation in 1953 (initially named the ‚ÄòCleary Charitable Trust‚Äô). The aims of The Foundation have been to assist charities involved in education, the arts, conservation and the natural environment. The causes supported are located for the most part in South East Kent. For over thirty years from the early 1950s onwards Cleary became a leading light in the provision of many gardens and open spaces provided by the Corporation of the City of London and others, resulting in his nickname ‚ÄòFlowering Fred‚Äô. = Property renovation = Cleary established the company Haslemere Estates before the war with the purpose of undertaking renovations of houses. The name was taken from 'Haslemere Road' in Crouch End, near where he lived. Until 1958, Haslemere Estates was modestly active. However, in 1958 Cleary retired from the London and Investment Mortgage Company and focussed his time and energy on Haslemere Estates with the support of Frank Collier and Hilda Lupton. The Company flourished and with a growing board of Directors, including David Pickford (Managing Director) the company went public in 1961. The company continued to prosper over the subsequent 25 years before being acquired by Rodamco (part of the Dutch asset management group, Robeco) in 1986. ‚ÄòHaslemere‚Äô specialised in restoring the integrity and elegance of period buildings, while simultaneously allowing for the considerations of the modern occupiers of such property. Cleary was ahead of his time in seeking to restore the old, rather than demolish it. His influence was such that before long ‚ÄòDoing a Haslemere‚Äô became the term coined in the property world for formidable restoration projects. The work of Haslemere was lauded equally by both property developers and preservationists. Lord Duncan Sandys President and Founder of The Civic Trust wrote about Haslemere Estates saying: > \\"No company has done more than Haslemere Estates to preserve our > irreplaceable architectural heritage by the restoration of old buildings and > their adaptation to present day uses. In a striking manner, Haslemere > Estates have proved beyond doubt that commercial interests and architectural > conservation are by no means incompatible, and can, in fact, be > complementary.\\" = Contributions to London's parks and gardens = Plaque in The Cleary Garden, Huggin Hill. London EC4 Cleary was a member of the Court of Common Council from 1959 to 1984 and was for three decades also Chairman of The Corporation of the City of London's Trees Gardens and Open Spaces Committee and the Metropolitan Public Gardens Association. In these roles, he was instrumental in creating green and restful spaces in the City, often on the site of bomb-damaged sites. Over 150 gardens within The City of London were transformed and maintained during his leadership, creating natural beauty out of war-torn scars and neglected spaces. Examples of ‚Äòscars of yesterday being turned into the gardens of today‚Äô are illustrated in Fred's books Beauty and the Borough and The Flowering City. In 1982 to mark their centenary, the Metropolitan Public Gardens AssociationMetropolitan Public Gardens Association funded the laying out of Cleary Garden, EC4, Huggin Hill. = Life in East Kent = Since his boyhood days, Cleary had visited the Kent Coast, his father having served in Dover during the First World War. St. Margaret's Bay had been a regular fixture during school holidays and made a great impression on the young Fred, to the extent that by the late 1940s he and his wife Norah became resident here. It was perhaps inevitable that Cleary would leave his mark locally, stepping in to acquire and preserve local land and buildings including Crabble Corn Mill near Dover and The Landmark Centre in Deal. Fred's most significant legacy in Kent was in establishing the foundations of The Bay Trust (The St Margaret's Bay Trust) in 1969, a charity committed to 'preserving the natural environment in the proximity of St. Margaret's Bay and undertaking related environmental education initiatives'. The Bay Trust continues this work to the present day. In 1975 Cleary purchased and refurbished (through the Cleary Foundation) an old rectory building ('Ripple Down House') in Ringwould. The site became an environmental education centre for children known as Rippledown now run and managed by The Bay Trust. The Bay Museum (later St Margaret's Museum) was opened in August 1989, where much of the collection of local maritime artefacts were collected by Cleary during his life.  Awards  Cleary was awarded an MBE (1951) and CBE (1979) in acknowledgement of his environmental and philanthropic activities. In 1976 Cleary was made an honorary fellow of Magdalene College, Cambridge where he funded the restoration of the Pepys Library and the Cleary Research Fellowship award (which remains available to Land Economy students studying at the College). In 1981 he was awarded the Veitch Memorial Medal by the Royal Horticultural Society in recognition of his services to Gardening in the City of London and elsewhere.

He was a member of various far-right organizations, including the Wiking-Jugend and the Free German Workers' Party. Lemke was also a mercenary in the HOS militia during the Croatian War. In his apartment, the police also found so-called Anti-Antifa lists of enemies with names and addresses of political opponents.  Crimes  Lemke, who had been convicted for arson, assault, volksverhetzung (incitement to hatred) and illegal possession of firearms, on July 18, 1995 drove together with his girlfriend Bianka W. and mutual friend Dagmar K. to Altena, where they kidnapped one of his girlfriend's acquaintances, gagged her, took her to a forest, and began strangling her with a rope. As the victim gasped, Lemke hit her several times with a folding spade, burying the dead woman in a hole in the ground. The prosecution suspected that he forced his girlfriend to act in order to \\"have her in hand\\", because he feared she would report him, and began acting more violently towards her. On February 2, 1996, Lemke went to Oberhausen and visited his friend Marcel M. Together they drove to Bergisch Gladbach to the apartment of Patricia W. Lemke had met her at the station in Hagen and because she had a sticker saying \\"Nazis out\\" on her clothes, he wanted to kill her. The woman opened the door, whereupon she was immediately handcuffed, undressed, raped by Lemke, throttled with a shoelace, hit with a plaster cast on the head and finally killed by 91 stab wounds. On March 15, 1996, Lemke shot dead 26-year-old Martin K. at a staircase in Rhade. He was a traitor in Lemke's eyes, because he had announced that he was dropping out of the far-right scene and was going to testify against Lemke.  Conviction  He was sentenced in March 1997 by the Essen court of assize for three murders and one rape to life imprisonment, with subsequent placement in psychiatry and preventative detention. By determining the particular gravity of the guilt, the court imposed the maximum penalty. Bianka W. was sentenced to six years for murder and Marcel M. was sentenced to five years in prison for aiding and abetting.

It was subsequently released in Europe and in Australia as the follow up single to \\"Give a Little Bit.\\" Lyrics and music Hodgson wrote \\"Babaji\\" in honour of Mahavatar Babaji, whom he regarded as a Christ- or Krishna-like figure, or even a manifestation of the spirit or force of God. According to Supertramp drummer Bob Siebenberg, \\"Babaji is like Roger's light of life\\" and \\"Roger's guiding light sort of guy.\\" The lyrics reflect this in lines such as \\"All my life I felt that you were listening/Watching for ways to help me stay in tune\\" and \\"Babaji, oh won't you come to me/Won't you help me face the music.\\" Music critic Dale Winnitowy described the song's religious content as \\"George Harrison-like.\\" The lyrics emphasise the need for effort in order to attain enlightenment from the search for Babaji. Other band members were less enthralled with the song's spiritual subject matter. Keyboardist Rick Davies told NME that \\"Personally, I decry it. I'd sooner remain anonymous than become religious. I might fight with Roger on this next album about that ... It's not right. You've got people in the band who couldn't give a damn.\\" Saxophonist John Helliwell stated that \\"when [Hodgson] wrote about Christ or Babaji‚Äîwhoever that is‚Äîwe just wished he would sing about something else.\\" According to Siebenberg, Hodgson \\"came up with the different bits of time\\" that he played on the song. He said that of the songs on Even in the Quietest Moments... \\"Babaji\\" took the longest to work out the drum parts because everything had to be very precise, including which parts were played on which drum or bell. Reception Music critic Mark Moran described \\"Babaji,\\" as well as \\"Give a Litte Bit,\\" as having a \\"leisurely pace and gentle melody\\" which Helliwell attributed to the band's growing maturity. Steve Wosahla of the Messenger-Press similarly acknowledged those two songs as representing the \\"more 'subtle' approach the band had hoped to incorporate\\" into Even in the Quietest Moments..., calling them \\"excellent complements\\" to the harder songs on the album. Brandon Sun critic Graham Hicks felt that the song \\"could have been a classic\\" but falls short due to the non-electric piano being unable to achieve the \\"light, strident\\" notes Hicks believes the song calls for, and due to \\"unimaginative and repetitive\\" percussion and bass guitar playing. Sounds critic Geoff Barton found \\"Babaji\\" to be \\"less than enthralling.\\" AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine described it as \\" a pseudo-spiritual moment that falls from the pop mark.\\" \\"Babaji\\" was later released on the 2000 compilation album The Very Best of Supertramp 2.

Between 1983 and 1990, he murdered five girls and women between the ages of 15 to 31, abusing three of them sexually. His crimes were known as \\"hitchhiker killings\\" or \\"Disco-murders\\". In 1985, the program Aktenzeichen XY ‚Ä¶ ungel√∂st covered his case.  Murders  The first murder was committed in July 1983 near Alsdorf: the 18-year-old Marion Gerecht was at a bus stop when she was attacked by Schiffer. When he attacked her, she fought him with all her strength and even trampled his windshield. Although she was able to prevent a rape, she was strangled, stripped and thrown into a fishing pond. In February 1984, Schiffer attacked 15-year-old Andrea Wernicke near the nightclub 'Rockfabrik\\" Uebach- Palenbeg, Geilenkirchen, country Heinsberg. whenroad B221. She habitually tramped home after visiting the nightclub. He raped the schoolgirl (from Herzogenrath-Merkstrin) before he strangled her and dumped her body near an open field. On August 31, 1984, the 17-year-old Angelika Sehl got into Schiffer's car. In December 1985, 18-year-old Marion Lauven was abducted, raped and killed in Aachen. She too had been standing at a bus stop. For an hour, Schiffer drove across the country with the body in the trunk until he found a place to drop it off. He covered her bare body with leaves and then left. On June 16, 1990, Sabine Neumann disappeared in Niederkr√ºchten on the way from the \\"Inside\\" nightclub. Schiffer had dragged the 31-year-old into his Mercedes, where he raped and strangled her. A year later, her skeletonized corpse was found by passers-by in a forest near Wegberg. Based on dental records the body was identified as that of the missing woman.  Arrest and conviction  In March 2007 Egidius Schiffer was caught and arrested in Heinsberg while trying to steal scrap metal. He voluntarily gave a saliva sample, with the results exposing him as the perpetrator of the five murders. He was arrested on August 23 for murder. During the confession, he confessed to the five murders, but recanted his confessions before the district court on the grounds that he had sadomasochistic tendencies. He only admitted to the murders because the thought of pre-trial detention and punishment had aroused him. Schiffer also alleged that he was forced to confess. However, the court relied on the repeated confession of Schiffer which also had \\"disclosed perpetrator's knowledge\\", as well as the DNA traces present at the crime scenes. He was sentenced on August 19, 2008, 18 years after his last murder, by the Aachen Regional Court for murder in five cases and rape in two cases to life imprisonment. The court also noted the particular severity of the guilt. A revision was rejected by the Federal Court of Justice in June 2009.  Death  On the morning of July 22, 2018, Schiffer was found dead in his cell in the Bochum correctional facility. There he had connected his body to the power grid using multiple cables to support autoerotic practises, and he died as a result of heart arrhythmia.

The league will be played between 26 teams (highest no. of teams ever) which will be divided into two groups. The Group A contains public sector clubs and the Group B contains private owned clubs. This decision was taken after the failure of private clubs who were not able to finish top 3 in the league table due to which clubs were not allowed entry into the I-League 2nd Division, another reason was the public sector clubs commitment for company tournaments due to which there were matches which got postponed, delaying the league further.

Lydia L., a former prostitute born in 1939, invited older men to live with her in a relationship or to care for the elderly. The men were later murdered by her and her helper, Siegmund S. However, a turnaround occurred when her aide himself reported the crimes to the police, confessing his participation in them as well. The following relationships were assigned to Lydia L.: * Ludwig G. from Biebertal. In 1983, he met the women at the age of 82. In September 1985, he pointed at Lydia for being his sole heir, and on January 5, 1986, he died in a hospital. * Wilhelm S., a master mason from the Sauerland. * Paul P., who died at the age of 83 in February 1991. * Alois M. * G√ºnter S., 74, strangled in June 1994. * Adolf B. from Melsungen, was suffocated in September 1994 with a pillow. * Paul G., stunned by Lydia L. in April 1995 and then strangled by Siegmund S. * Gerhard G., smothered with a plastic bag by the two offenders on July 13, 2000, in his house in V√∂lksen, near Hanover. In the last four cases, the court recognized as murders. Lydia L. was sentenced to life imprisonment in 2009 by the District Court of G√∂ttingen, and she is now serving in the Vechta Prison. A revision submitted by her was unsuccessful. Lydia's accomplice Siegmund S. was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment, which he served in the Rosdorf correctional facility. By his own account, he said that he had been afraid of being poisoned. In 2014, Lydia L. sued the new owner of her house, who was said to have disposed of personal belongings without her permission. The claim was dismissed by the court.  See also  * List of serial killers by country  External links  * Christian Saehrendt, Steen T. Kittl: All Bluff! How we become imposters without wanting to.

Life  Mayer was born in Uersfeld, the son of Gunderath-born non-sedentary day laborer Johann Wilhelm Mayer and his wife Anna Maria (n√©e Knorr). The place of birth in which Mayer was first baptized on his birthday and regularly baptized the next day, was rather coincidental, as his traveling parents did not have a permanent home. As a child Mayer attended the school in Boos, before he started work in a quarry. Due to an accident in the quarry - possibly through careless handling - Mayer lost his left forearm, which earned him the nickname \\"Stumpfarm\\", even before his criminal career began. Since then he was only partially able to work as a farmhand and harvest helper. At the time of the First World War, Mayer, who was incapable of military service, increasingly fell into an unsteady lifestyle. He only did her murder in the woods between Elzbach and Endert, but was also given penalties for assault, theft and poaching.  Crimes  From March 1918 to May 1919, Mayer killed three women with whom he had previous relationships, as well as two men, with whom he had previously been friends with. * Maria Dahm from Mayen, 23 years old, murdered between March 18‚Äì24, 1918 in the Mayen town forest. * Maria Falk from Bonn, 28 years old, murdered in February 1919 in the forest between Masburg and Hauroth. * Nikolaus Sch√ºller from Kalenborn, 30 years old, murdered on March 30, 1911 in the forest near Mannebach. * Lorenz Reuter from Masburg, 22 years old, murdered on April 26, 1919 in the forest district of Etscheid between Boos and Mannebach. * Katharina Forst from Mannebach-Sickerath, 34 years old widow with three children, who disappeared in May 1919 and whose body was found more than a year later in the forest near Illerich. As a murder weapon Mayer used a carbine, and in later interrogations, he described the crimes with \\"A shot, a scream, all over.\\" To disguise his actions, he separated the heads and limbs of his male victims and exchanged them. The well-known \\"Stumpfarm\\" was investigated on July 9, 1919, but remained undetected working as a farmhand in Eulgem. However, on August 10, 1922, he was recognized and accosted by vagrants in the S√§nger district northwest of the village. The prisoner was first detained in Kaisersesch, then moved to Koblenz.  Condemnation  Since Johann Mayer did not confess before the Koblenz jury court, he was sentenced to death on February 7, 1923 for fourfold murder and because of the one manslaughter - 15 years imprisonment. A confession was filed by \\"Stumpfarm\\" shortly before his execution, after mercy petitions were rejected. The death sentence against Mayer was enforced on December 29, 1923 in the courtyard of the Cologne prison, where he was decapitated by the guillotine.

The group is made up of former Jund al-Aqsa members. Background Ansar al-Tawhid was established in March 2018 by Abu Diyab al-Sarmini. The group is based in Sarmin and Nayrab in eastern Idlib, which have a strong ISIL presence in Idlib but also is active in opposition held parts of the Latakia Governorate. Among Ansar al-Tawhid there are members of the group who are sympathetic and supportive of ISIL as well as members of Ansar al-Tawhid whom are reportedly linked to ISIL itself, as well as members of the group that are closer to HTS and are linked with it and support them, there are also members of the group who continue to hold a neutral position, much like the original Jund al-Aqsa's stance in the dispute between ISIL and other opposition and Jihadist groups like HTS. The group also includes fighters formerly part of the Turkistan Islamic Party in Syria, which itself included former Jund al-Aqsa fighters that elected to stay in Idlib in 2017 rather than leave to ISIL's capital in al-Raqqa, and fighters that refused to join Hayat Tahrir al-Sham for ideological reasons. Ansar al-Tawhid is also believed to be by some to be a receptacle group for former ISIL fighters. The group has also initiated recruitment campaigns in parts of the southern Idlib countryside and in Maarrat al-Nu'man. The group is also reportedly well armed with mortars, anti-aircraft guns, and armored vehicles. The group itself reportedly has 1,000 fighters, and sources linked with HTS claim that a majority of them are not native Syrians. After its formation the group coordinated with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham to attack a Syrian government held enclave in two predominantly Shiite villages outside of Idlib's city limits. The group established the Alliance to Support Islam with the Guardians of Religion Organization with the stated goals of establishing Sharia law and fighting against aggressors. Though the group works closely with the Guardians of Religion Organization and is believed to have links to al-Qaeda, Ansar al- Tawhid does not consider itself to be part of al-Qaeda nor does it hold allegiance to al-Qaeda, and al-Qaeda has not acknowledged the group as being part of its global network. Structure =Leadership= The group's leader Abu Diyab Sarmini who originates from the town of Sarmin, Sarmini was the former leader of Jund al-Aqsa (which pledged allegiance to Jabhat Fateh al- Sham for protection from Ahrar al-Sham amidst fighting between Jund al-Aqsa and Ahrar al-Sham in 2016). Sarimini began recruiting former Jund al-Aqsa members who had joined Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and the Turkistan Islamic Party in Syria after Jund al-Aqsa was dissolved by HTS, as well as former Jund al-Aqsa members that were wanted by HTS. Sarmini specifically recruited fighters who had remained neutral during the fighting between Ahrar al-Sham, HTS and Jund al-Aqsa to form Ansar al-Tawhid. Prior to Ansar al-Tawhid's formation, meetings were held between Sarmini and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham's leader, Abu Mohammad al-Julani, to convince HTS to release 5 former Jund al-Aqsa members, whom were commanders, imprisoned by HTS. In order to recruit former Jund al- Aqsa members as well as new outsiders, the group has advertised that it is similar to the original Jund al-Aqsa in regards to beliefs and ideology. =Media= The group produces videos showing its military operations and attacks as well as training camps, the videos use nasheeds produced by both ISIL and al-Qaeda and contain video montages and focus on the group's view of conflict in Syria. History On 26 April 2018, Ansar al-Tawhid carried out a joint attack with Jaysh al-Izza and the Guardians of Religion Organization, which is another al-Qaeda aligned group that split off from Hayat Tahrir al- Sham and is led by al-Nusra's former head Sharia official, Sami al-Oraydi, targeting the Syrian military and allied paramilitary groups, during the fighting casualties were reported on both sides, as well as exchanges of artillery fire. During the attack the rebel groups advanced into government held territory and temporarily held positions before being expelled later on. In May 2018, HTS raided the headquarters of Ansar al-Tawhid in Sarmin and arrested three members from the group for having links to ISIL. On 5 December 2018, Ansar al-Tawhid and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham jointly repelled a Syrian government infiltration attempt in Tell Touqan. On 3 February 2019, two of Ansar al-Tawhid's commanders were killed near the government held enclave of Fuah; one of the commanders was Turkish. In March 2019, the group attacked two significant Syrian army checkpoints in northern Hama, claiming to have killed 40 Syrian soldiers, however only 16 were confirmed killed. During the attack the Syrian army had acknowledged an unspecified number of soldiers had been killed by Ansar al-Tawhid fighters and blamed bad weather for making the attack easier for the group. In response to the attack the Syrian military displayed corpses of fighters reportedly part of Ansar al-Tawhid who had been killed during the attacks on the checkpoints. After the attack, according to a pro-government source, the Syrian army claimed to have killed the group's deputy leader, a Chechen fighter named Khamza Shishani. In April 2019, the group claimed responsibility for an Inghimasi attack against pro-Assad forces in northern Hama, and released photos showing fighters carrying Kalashnikov rifles mounted with night vision scopes and wearing explosive belts. On 2 August 2019, Ansar al-Tawhid coordinated with the Turkistan Islamic Party to fire an IRAM rocket with four 122mm rockets attached at government forces. On 17 August 2019, after a rebel counter-attack to retake the recently lost town of Sukayk from pro-government forces, the group announced to have retaken positions outside the city alongside other rebel groups, after fighting Hezbollah. On 31 August 2019, the American-led CJTF-OIR coalition carried out missile attacks in Idlib targeting a meeting between Ansar al-Tawhid and the Guardians of Religion Organization reportedly killing a total of 40 members from both groups. After the attack the Russian military condemned the strike saying that the attack was not coordinated with Russia or Turkey and violated the terms of a cease-fire in Idlib. The attack left 30 dead including civilians, among the casualties from the attack was a 12 year old child soldier as well as a 70 year old civilian farmer. After the coalition's attack on Ansar al-Tawhid, HTS arrested the group's religious leader Abu Hakim al- Jazrawi, and analysts have speculated this could be part of an attempt on behalf of HTS to distance itself from foreign fighters and ultimately confront groups such as Ansar al-Tawhid. On 17 March 2020, Sputnik news reported that a source in Idlib claimed that Ansar al-Tawhid as well as the Rouse the Believers Operations Room, which Ansar al-Tawhid is part of, along with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and the Turkistan Islamic Party in Syria reject a Russian- Turkish cease-fire deal in Idlib after months of clashes between November 2019 and March 2020, with the deal entailing joint Russian-Turkish military patrols, and that Ansar al-Tawhid along with the other groups were also preparing to attack Russian military personnel in Idlib and patrols. On 3 May 2020, Ansar al-Tawhid released a statement, claiming to not be affiliated with any other groups, and hold no allegiance to any other group either secretly or publicly, and also denied being part of any alliance or operations room, while also acknowledging previously being part of such entities, and also claimed they would continue to cooperate with unnamed factions when needed. It also ended its alliance with the Guardians of Religion Organization after Ansar al- Tawhid accused it of breaking the terms of their alliance.

Development Kazuo Ishiguro's writing influenced Akbar to write the story from a female perspective. Akbar had wanted to write since his childhood and quit his job as a journalist to pursue a writing career. He wanted to depict the political changes that can \\"have a devastating impact on people's lives\\" by humanising the impact. He said that he was drawn by the \\"isolated, insular experience\\" of cities like Delhi and Mumbai: \\"In today's India, there are forces at work which are beyond our immediate control. There are huge, overarching political changes that can have personal ramifications, and can go on to devastate lives.\\" He started writing with the idea of a mother and a daughter being separated. After reading Kazuo Ishiguro's 1982 novel A Pale View of Hills, Akbar wanted to write a story from a women's perspective as it gave him \\"a sense that a male writer could write absolutely effectively in a woman‚Äôs voice, a mother‚Äôs voice.\\" Akbar began writing the story with Shalini and her daughter while the elements of dystopia came later on. Akbar felt that in India, it is always important to ascribe the \\"minute identities of caste and subcaste to each other.\\" He said this experience inspired the setting of the novel. The novel was written over the course of five years. Akbar said that he deliberately chose \\"Leila\\" as the main character's name as it is both a Muslim and a Christian name. He wanted to show that \\"people also exist between the [religion] space.\\" Leila was published by Simon & Schuster on 20 April 2017 in various formats. The novel is available as an audiobook narrated by Tania Rodriguez. Reception Writing for The Economic Times, Lopamudra Ghatak described the novel as \\"stark\\" and Shalini's pain \\"at her loss and longing\\" ... \\"evocative\\". Minakshi Raja of The Free Press Journal described the book as \\"well worth a read\\" but felt the ending was \\"too Indian filmi\\". Karishma Kuenzang of India Today said that the book is \\"intriguing enough to keep you hooked till the last page\\". She also compared it to Amitav Ghosh's The Shadow Lines, which was based on a similar theme. Ananya Borgohain of The Pioneer praised the novel saying it is \\"fascinatingly surreal and social at the same time.\\" She noted: \\"Aside from the political and social commentary, what sets Prayaag Akbar‚Äôs first book apart is that it is a highly emotional journey about a mother-daughter relationship.\\" A review published by The Telegraph said: \\"The resemblance between the reality in which we live and the horrific world that Akbar conjures up is striking.\\" Aditya Mani Jha of The Hindu Business Line compared the mother-daughter bond with that in Cormac McCarthy's The Road. Rini Burman of The Indian Express wrote: \\"Prayaag Akbar conjures up a future society, the inner seams of which reflect rigid class and caste divisions ‚Äî almost eerie echoes of the reality we are living out now.\\" Keshava Guha of The Hindu called it a \\"gripping debut novel that is a dystopian work that speaks directly to the ongoing changes in India‚Äôs politics and society.\\" Nandini Krishnan of The Wire praised the writing saying, \\"The world that Akbar evokes is not frightening so much as credible.\\" Avantika Mehta of Hindustan Times described the novel as a \\"powerful debut\\" that \\"knocks you sideways with its complex questions.\\" Bhanuj Kappal of The National wrote: \\"Akbar‚Äôs writing is tight and unrelenting, never letting our attention drift too far from the twin poles of Shalini‚Äôs fear, self-recrimination and the pain of separation ‚Äì from her daughter, her family, everything that represents the illusion of safety ‚Äì and her unflagging determination to find Leila despite the odds.\\" Trisha Gupta of Scroll.in felt the future shown in the novel is \\"really already here.\\" Somak Ghoshal of HuffPost wrote: \\"Beyond all its shattering prophecies, Leila is a tale of heartbreak, experienced by a woman for her husband and daughter ‚Äî but also for everything else that once anchored her to the illusion of safety.\\" Nudrat Kamal of Dawn called the prose \\"engaging\\" and said the \\"narrative tension of Shalini‚Äôs increasingly desperate attempts to reunite with her daughter keeps the reader in its thrall.\\" Aditya Singh of The Millions felt the novel was a \\"political and social allegory\\" with a \\"powerful commentary on the inherently unstable foundations that India‚Äôs societal setup rests upon.\\" Roger Cox of The Scotsman called the novel timely and memorable saying it \\"takes \\"xenophobic small-mindedness to its chilling conclusion.\\" Kerryn Goldsworthy of The Sydney Morning Herald noted that Akbar uses the \\"Indian caste system and builds on its hierarchical divisiveness to create a society in which everyone must be labelled by categories and sub-categories of race, religion and family, and movements around the city are strictly monitored.\\" Akbar was awarded the juried Crossword Book Award for fiction. He also won the Tata Literature Live First Book Award. It was also shortlisted for The Hindu Literary Prize. Adaptation In February 2018, Netflix announced it was commissioning an original series based on the novel. Produced by Deepa Mehta, it starred Huma Qureshi, Siddharth, Rahul Khanna, Sanjay Suri and Arif Zakaria. Directed by Mehta, Shanker Raman and Pawan Kumar, the series began filming in November 2018 and finished in April 2019.

Career =Justine= In London, in the late 1960s, Styvers responded to an advertisement for female singers which had been placed by John McBurnie (latterly of Jackson Heights) and Keith Trowsdale. The three, with additional vocalists Bethlyn Bates and Valerie Cope, formed the psychedelic folk band Justine and recorded one album with producer Hugh Murphy, which was released in 1970. Styvers left soon afterwards and the remaining group disbanded. =Solo= With Murphy as producer, co-writer and boyfriend, Styvers released two solo albums and one single between 1972 and 1973. None were commercially successful. Reviewing her Spilt Milk LP (released in 1971 by Warner Bros.), Robert Christgau wrote in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981): \\"Normally, I ignore records as rightfully obscure as this one, but I thought it was time I mentioned that our hippest record company is getting more complacent all the time‚Äîjust how many L.A. airheads can we stand? Styvers is the kind of person who makes me like junkies‚Äîyou know, the baby you want to steal candy from, so trite and pretty- poo in her fashionably troubled adolescence that you hope she chokes on her own money.

The story moves between first-person narrative to an unnamed observer. It was highly controversial in Australia upon its publication, with some prominent critics dismissing it as pornographic, though Ettler herself has strongly denied this. Since its initial publication, critics and scholars have read deeper meaning into the novel's plot and style, with some determining it as a post-modernism novel about domestic violence, nihilism in urban environments and toxic relationships, with absurdist or surreal features. The book was shortlisted for the 1995 Aurealis Awards for Excellence in Australian Speculative Fiction - Horror Division - Best Novel. The first edition cover published by Picador in 1995 features the tagline \\"an uncompromising love story\\" underneath the title, and while the novel does explore a no strings attached sexual relationship, Ettler has been adamant in stating that the novel was not about love (rather the misguided pursuit of it) nor was it intended to be erotic or romantic. A reprinting in 2018 features a new cover image, implying the darker nature of the novel. Plot synopsis The River Ophelia is set in Sydney, though the name is never mentioned. The novel concerns the pursuits of the protagonist Justine, a university student in inner-city Sydney, and her relationship with the destructive, abusive narcissist Sade, a well-paid journalist for a trashy rock magazine. The violent, depraved sociopathic Sade regularly uses Justine for his own sexual exploits, and as she recognises this, goes on her own destructive pursuit for sexual fulfilment. Other characters, such as Hamlet, Ophelia, Simone and Marcelle appear later in the story. They regularly consume hard drugs, and are absorbed in a heavy capitalist culture with fluid, occasionally sexually violent open relationships. The only character who ostensibly seems to pursue love, or a healthy monogamous relationship, is Justine. Sade regularly taunts Justine in a sadistic fashion, and sometimes parades his other women around in front of her. The sex is often clinical and kinky, rather than romantic or passionate. As a response she often lashes out and engages in her own sadistic behaviour in an attempt to mimic or seek revenge on the sordid behaviour of her adversaries because she cannot seem to overcome them. Acting against the grain, slowly giving up on the pursuit of healthy love in an urban environment that rejects healthy love, Justine despairs and delves into hard drug use before eventually seeking a more permanent solution to her woes and oppressions. Publication and themes Ettler's novel was published in 1995 by Picador. The cover features a naked woman, sprawled over a chair, with her head hanging between her knees. Ettler has been outspoken in her issue with this depiction: \\"To me the whole question of Justine's sexuality isn‚Äôt the central issue. Her sexual behaviour is a symptom masking what‚Äôs really going on at a deeper level, which is to do with power. If there is an issue in the novel to do with sex it's about sex addiction ‚Äì which, incidentally, is on the rise due to the digital revolution, so The River Ophelia is more relevant than ever as more women are placed in the unhappy situation faced by Justine as the girlfriend of a sex addict. The whole nude cover thing irritated me from the start. It‚Äôs misleading. I had no control over the cover\\". When the novel was re-published in 2018, it was given a new front cover that is more true to the violent, sexually depraved nature of the novel. The novel makes overt references to Brett Easton Ellis's American Psycho (1991), a work of similar tone and parody about empty consumerist culture and the emotionally absent sex lives of yuppies in Manhattan, much as The River Ophelia is about wealthy Sydneysiders with empty, drug-addled lives that are ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù only at a surface level. Some scholars have called The River Ophelia a feminist text. Critical reception and legacy The River Ophelia received a divisive response from Australian critics. It was reviewed in various prominent Australian newspapers, such as The Sydney Morning Herald, The Age and The Australian. Some praised it for its sardonic and satirical approach to the morally impoverished lives of privileged young white university students and yuppies in Sydney's upper-class suburbs, while others dismissed it as being too obscene, violent and sexually explicit. Critic Don Anderson called the novel a \\"marriage between Helen Garner and the Marquis de Sade\\". Some critics have identified the novel as an example of grunge lit, a series of unrelated but thematically equal Australian novels dealing with disenfranchised and alienated urban life. Ettler relocated to London in 1997 to escape the fallout caused by the novel in Australia. She returned to Sydney in the 2000s, and in 2018 addressed The River Ophelia's impact: \\"I can finally set the record straight ‚Äì The River Ophelia is a postmodern novel about domestic violence. I can also acknowledge the scholarship which has defended it\\". She used the #MeToo movement and increasing awareness of sadomasochism and sexual abuse in mainstream media as encouraging signs that attention towards sexual mistreatment is finally being recognised publicly. =Legacy= The novel was a best-seller in both Australia and New Zealand. The cover of the first edition was printed and stuck on poles in inner-city Sydney and Melbourne in 1995, while Ettler herself did numerous publicity, including morning talk shows and television as well as radio interviews. In the 1990s, The River Ophelia was added to the Higher School Certificate reading list in the Australian secondary education system.

Evans is an American sports and entertainment executive. Early life and career Evans was born in Ogden, Utah. In 1966, he graduated from the University of Denver with a bachelor's degree in business administration. Evans held various management positions in the amusement park industry. He helped plan and develop Disney World for Walt Disney Productions, developed Marriott Corporation's two Great America amusement parks (now known as California's Great America and Six Flags Great America), and planned an amusement park in Orlando, Florida for Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus that was never built. Radio City Music Hall In 1980, Evans was named chief executive officer of Radio City Music Hall Productions. Evans identified five areas that could operate inside the building as well as work outside the Hall. These were the Christmas Spectacular Starring the Radio City Rockettes, concerts (Radio City eventually controlled 60% of the New York concert market), a theatrical touring company, special-events, and television production. Under Evans' management, Radio City turned a profit for the first time in 30 years. Madison Square Garden Evans was named president and CEO of Madison Square Garden Corporation on November 3, 1986. In this role he was responsible for operations of Madison Square Garden, the MSG Network, the New York Rangers, and the New York Knicks. After taking over, Evans reorganized the corporation into four operating groups - MSG Sports, MSG Entertainment, MSG Communications, and MSG Facilities Development & Management. Former MSG legal counsel Jack Diller was brought in to run the sports group. During his tenure at MSG, Evans oversaw the arena's $200 million renovation as well as the construction of the Paramount Theatre, which replaced the Felt Forum. =New York Knicks= Following the 1986-87 NBA season, Evans fired Knicks General Manager Scotty Stirling and head coach Bob Hill. Evans was criticized for going to a speaking engagement in Venice while coaching candidates Rick Pitino and Larry Brown faced deadlines to re-sign with their college teams. Evans stated that he planned to have a new general manager and coach in place by the 1987 NBA Draft on June 22, however it wasn't until July 8 - 80 days after Stirling and Hill were fired and after five other teams had hired hire new coaches, that Evans hired Al Bianchi as general manager. Although Pitino had signed a new contract with Providence College two months earlier, he was able to obtain his release from the school and became the Knicks' head coach. Bianchi acquired Charles Oakley, Sidney Green, Johnny Newman, and drafted Rod Strickland. Mark Jackson, who was drafted by scouting director Dick McGuire in the '87 draft, won Rookie of the Year. In 1988-89 the Knicks won their first division title in nearly twenty years. After the season, Rick Pitino chose to return to college basketball and was succeeded by assistant Stu Jackson. On December 3, 1990, Stu Jackson was fired and replaced as Knicks head coach by John MacLeod. On March 1, 1991, Evans fired Knicks general manager Al Bianchi and replaced him with Dave Checketts. Evans also demoted MSG sports group head Jack Diller by removing his oversight of the Knicks and naming him president of the Rangers. =New York Rangers= After the 1986-87 NHL season, head coach Tom Webster resigned due to illness. Unlike the Knicks' coaching search, the Rangers, at general manager Phil Esposito's urging, quickly hired Michel Bergeron. Esposito acquired Brian Mullen, Chris Nilan, Bob Froese, and Kelly Kisio while Tony Granato, Brian Leetch, and Ulf Dahlen, who were drafted by Esposito's predecessor Craig Patrick, also joined the roster. In 1989-90, the Rangers won their first ever division title. =Resignation= On March 18, 1991, Stanley R. Jaffe became president of MSG's parent company, Paramount. According to Diller, Jaffe \\"decided he is going to shake things up\\". Many of Evans' top assistants, including Jack Diller, were fired and Paramount ignored his request for a long-term contract. On August 5, 1991, Evans resigned from Madison Square Garden. Gaylord Entertainment After leaving Madison Square Garden, Evans became president and CEO of Dorna USA, a subsidiary of Dorna promoci√≥n del deporte. In February 1993 he was named executive vice president and chief operating officer of Gaylord Entertainment, which owned the Grand Ole Opry, Opreyland Hotel, Opryland USA, TNN, and CMT. While at Gaylord, Evans led the effort to pass tax measures to build arenas and stadiums to lure professional sports teams to the city. He helped persuade Bud Adams to relocate the National Football League's Houston Oilers to Nashville. He also helped the city get to the top of the NHL's expansion list after attempts to have the Florida Panthers and New Jersey Devils relocate to the city failed. Huizenga Sports In September 1996, Evans announced that he was resigning from Gaylord to become president and CEO of H. Wayne Huizenga's Huizenga Sports & Entertainment Group, which owned the Miami Dolphins, Florida Marlins, Florida Panthers, and Pro Player Stadium. Evans left Huizenga on April 15, 1998 \\"in order to pursue private business and investment interests\\".

On June 4, 2015, LifePoint Health named Evans its lead director of the company's board of directors.

She works at the University of Texas where she is the John A. Wilson Professor in Vertebrate Paleontology. Life Clarke's first degree was from Brown University in 1995 where she studied both geobiology and comparative literature. She went on to study at Yale University's Geobiology and Geophysics department where she gained her doctorate in 2002. Clarke holds the John A. Wilson Professorship in Vertebrate Paleontology at the University of Texas. Clarke discovered within the rocks of Vega Island in the Antarctic in 1992, Vegavis iaai which was an early relative of ducks and geese in 2005. It is thought to be the only species of modern bird to have lived at the time of the dinosaurs. She studied the voice organ (syrinx) of a fossil originally found in 1992. The findings by her and other researchers was published in the science journal Nature. Fossils of the ancient bird Inkayacu were first discovered in 2008 on the Pacific coast of Ica, Peru. A nearly complete skeleton was uncoveredInkayacu at Fossilworks.org in the Paracas National Reserve by a team led by Rodolfo Salas and studied by a team led by Clarke. This was the first recovered fossil with feathers attached to it. The feathers were preserved enough such that Liliana D'Alba and Ali J. Altamirano were able to perform analysis of the melanosomes which are responsible for pigment. Until now, without the addition of feathers, there has not been any research conducted on the nanostructure of ancient feathers. Large penguins, including the species Perudyptes devriesi and Icadyptes salasi, had been described from the area the previous year. In 2016 she speculated that based on her research she felt it was unlikely that dinosaurs roared. She proposed that it was much more likely that they made noises that were similar to those made by a modern pigeon. Julia Clarke's slides included this tongue in cheek guide to dinosaur colour Caihong's colour restoration In 2018 she was reporting on a small chicken sized dinosaur that was found in China by a farmer. The dinosaur was relatively well preserved and analysis indicates that it had multi-feathers. The creature is not thought to have been able to fly but appears to have been a small carnivore. The feather's purpose may have been insulation whilst the variation in colour is thought to have made the dinosaur attractive to a potential mate. The creature is thought to have a multi coloured crest and this translates to its scientific name which is Caihong juji.

Founded in 2012, its purpose is to return Purple Hearts and other military awards that have become separated from the original recipients or their descendants. In circumstances where the original recipient has died and no descendants can be located, Purple Hearts Reunited arranges to donate awards to suitable organizations, including museums. Purpose Established in 2012 as 501 (c)(3) nonprofit foundation, Purple Hearts Reunited (PHR) works to return lost or stolen medals to recipients or their family at no cost to them. When possible, PHR conducts a ceremony to formally place the medal back in the hands of the recipient or family. In situations where a recipient or family member cannot be located, PHR works to identify a suitable alternative, such as a military museum. Zachariah Fike presenting a scholarship award to the family of Private First Class Alvie Scott in 2014 In circumstances where the recipient of a returned Purple Heart has not been included in the Purple Heart Hall of Honor, PHR ensures that the individual's name is added; As of March 2018, PHR has enrolled over 1500 recipients. Through early 2018, PHR staff and volunteers have returned more than 400 medals to the original recipients or to their families. Purple Hearts Reunited's programs also include memorial educational scholarships and a memorial monument campaign. History In 2009, Zachariah Fike, an officer in the Vermont Army National Guard with service in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom, received as a gift a Purple Heart his mother had purchased at an antique shop in Watertown, New York. His parents both served in the United States Army, and Fike is a Purple Heart recipient, so he was inspired to attempt returning the medal to the family of its original owner. He set the task aside while deployed to Afghanistan in 2009 and 2010, during which he was wounded and received the Purple Heart himself. After returning to the United States in 2010, Fike took up the task of returning his 2009 Christmas gift to its original owner or his family. After returning the medal to the sister of the original recipient, a World War II veteran, Fike's subsequent research revealed numerous Purple Hearts and other medals available for sale or trade through online auction sites, at antique stores, flea markets, and pawnshops, and through other sources. He began acquiring as many as he could, attempting to track down the recipients or their families, and returning the awards whenever possible. As the public became aware of Fike's efforts through media coverage of medal returns, he began to receive medals unsolicited from individuals who wanted them to be returned to the recipients or their families. These medals were often found in storage lockers, basements and attics, in boxes of clothing donated to Goodwill stores, and even in garbage cans. In 2012, Fike formalized his medal return efforts through creation of the Purple Hearts Reunited organization. Media coverage Purple Hearts Reunited return ceremonies are often covered by local and national news media. Individuals representing the organization have appeared on well-known programs including Fox & Friends. In February 2015, the Purple Hearts Reunited mission was the subject of a story in Reader's Digest, \\"This Is Why Zach Fike Reunites Purple Hearts With Soldiers Who Lost Them\\". In December 2016, Purple Hearts reunited was the subject of a BBC feature story, \\"The Medal Detective\\". In January 2017, Purple Hearts Reunited was featured in an episode of American Pickers, \\"Catch-32\\". The Purple Hearts Reunited mission was covered in David Isay's 2013 book The Ties That Bind and John C. Maxwell's 2015 book Intentional Living.

It was later also published as a single piece, entitled The Little Negro and Le petit n√®gre.  History  Debussy composed The Little Nigar (giving the noun this spelling) in 1909 on a commission from Th√©odore Lack, for his piano method M√©thode de Piano. The subtitle describes it as a cakewalk. It is reminiscent of Golliwogg's Cakewalk from his Children's Corner, a piano suite that he had composed a year earlier. In both pieces, rhythmic outer sections frame a melodic middle section. In Golliwogg's Cakewalk, the middle section satirically quotes the beginning of Tristan und Isolde by Richard Wagner, a composer who had influenced Debussy when he was young but from whose late romantic style Debussy later distanced himself. Debussy regularly sought exotic influences. In The Little Nigar, he alluded to banjo chords and drums, influenced by American minstrel shows. The piece, marked allegro, begins with a first theme presenting \\"jazzy\\" syncopes in 2/4 time, in the then popular ragtime style. It is followed by a lyrical passage, marked espressivo and pianissimo (very softly), which leads to a return of the first section. The first theme leans towards pentatonic and is accompanied by a chromatic sequence of broken minor thirds. The Little Nigar was first published in 1909 by √âditions Alphonse Leduc in Paris as part of Lack's piano method and again as a single piece in about 1934, now with an added repetition and entitled The Little Negro, with subtitle Le petit n√®gre. Debussy also used the piece's main theme in his 1913 ballet for children, La bo√Æte √† joujoux, in which it characterises an English soldier. Numerous transcriptions in various instrumentations have been made of the piece. An arrangement for woodwinds has even been used for advertising Purina One dog food.  Literature  * Schmitz, E.

Life  Marie Luise Meyer was born in Aachen where her father, Friedrich August Meyer, worked as a theatre inspector. He had recently married her mother, born Anna Maria Absenger, who was a stage singer. Luise had a younger sister, Marie Meyer (1840-1908) who went on to become a stage actress.Hartmut Binder: Gustav Meyrink. Ein Leben im Bann der Magie. Vitalis Verlag, Prag 2009, , p. 16f. She received her first musical education from her mother, who by this time was working as a soubrette in Breslau (as Wroc≈Çaw was known at that time). When she was 17 she moved to Vienna to receive further lessons in singing and stagecraft. Here, according to a biographical article in the Illustrirte Zeitung (newspaper), she had to \\"battle with many difficulties during the [brief but bloody] October uprising of 1848\\". Tantalisingly, the writer does not elaborate. She made her stage debut in the 1848/49 season at the Theater in der Josefstadt under the direction of the multi-talented Kapellmeister Albert Lortzing. After a time she left Vienna and joined her parents who were still working in Breslau. Here she took work at the City Theatre (\\"St√§dtische B√ºhne\\"). She was engaged during 1850 and 1851 as a stage singer at the Court Theatre in Kassel where she enjoyed great success as the company's lead soprano under the musical direction of Louis Spohr. Her reputation established, she was now able to broaden her horizons, touring theatres in various principal north German cities giving a succession of well applauded guest performances, notably in Braunschweig and Hamburg. In 1852 Luise Meyer switched to the Royal Court Theatre in Dresden, remaining under contract there till 1854. However, she was not well accepted by the theatre community in Dresden, and was happy to accept an invitation to move to Prague where she quickly became a favourite with audiences. From Prague she was able to travel and make a number of guest appearances elsewhere, notably in Stuttgart, Strasbourg and back in Vienna itself. During July 1856 she undertook a succession of guest performances at Vienna. She featured there in the first Vienna performances of Les Huguenots. Positive press reviews and public reactions adumbrated her future as the leading soprano of Vienna's Imperial Court Opera-Theatre (\\"K. K. Hof-Operntheater\\"). During this time she came to the notice of the Archduke Franz Karl who instructed that she should be invited to join the Court Opera. She was enrolled into the company in 1 January 1857. In 1858 she married Adalbert Dustmann, a Vienna book seller.Martin D√ºrrer, Isabel Kraft (ed) Richard Wagner, S√§mtliche Briefe, Band 9 ‚Äì Briefe August 1857 bis August 1858, 2003, Leipzig, Breitkopf und H√§rtel, , p. 678: ‚ÄûDustmann, Adalbert, Buchh√§ndler in Wien, Ehemann von Luise Dustmann- Meyer.‚Äú In 1860 she became an imperial \\"Hofkammers√§ngerin\\" (literally, \\"court chamber singer\\"), an important but largely honorific appointment. Her voice had developed into a powerful precise soprano one, with a good range and a particular pleasing euphony in the middle register. Her intonation was accurate and confident. Her natural gifts, backed by diligent and intense study, matched with a deep sensitivity to the true artistic potential of her various stage roles, made her well suited to portray leading characters, including Norma, Jessonda, Amalie in Ballo in maschera, Valentine in Les Huguenots, Mathilde in William Tell. By 1875 she had been seen and heard by an appreciative Viennese audience in almost all the important lead soprano roles of the time. That year she ended her full-time stage career in the role of Elsa von Brabant in Lohengrin. There were, however, further guest appearances as Amalie in Ballo in maschera in Court Opera productions in 1877 and 1881. Alongside the operas of Christoph Willibald Gluck, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Carl Maria von Weber, Meyer-Dustmann returned again and again to the operas of Richard Wagner. She conducted a lengthy correspondence with Wagner who always described her as \\"his soprano\\". There was evidently great mutual respect. When he was considering her for the Isolde role in the debut Karlsruhe production of Tristan and Isolde, the composer told his wife, Minna that Meyer-Dustmann had a \\"beautiful soulful voice, capable of anything [as well as] an excellent dramatic delivery\\", and a great range of nuance. By the time she retired from the stage Meyer-Dustmann had also built up a parallel career as a Lieder singer, with a particular focus on the songs of Mendelssohn and Schubert. On 5 January 1870, together with Rosa Girzick, Gustav Walter and Emil Krauss, she gave the first public performance of the Liebeslieder Walzer. The piano duet accompaniment was provided by the composer and Clara Schumann. After 1875 she took a teaching position with the conservatory at the city's Society of Friends of Music. Notable pupils included Lola Beeth, Hedwig H√ºbsch, Ida Krzyzanowski-Doxat, and Helene Wiet. She gave up her teaching role in Vienna in 1880 when, with her husband, she relocated to Berlin-Charlottenburg. Here she lived out the rest of her life.

It has been protected by the central government as a National Historic Site since 1999. Background Genbao Castle was built in 1583 on the peak of Mt. Uchinakao (460 meters) at the border of ≈åmi Province and Echizen Province. The area controlled the entrance into Hokuriku region from Kansai region, but had many steep mountains with deep valleys. From the ≈åmi side, two main roads passed through the mountains, joining at the location of Genbao Castle. The castle spread across 150 meters a mountain ridge orientated from north-to- south. The inner bailey at the highest point on the mountain, was a square shaped area approximately 60 meter long with a tower in its northeastern corner. As the castle was orientated against an attack from the south, two narrow buffer areas protected the inner bailey in this direction to delay any attackers. The bailey was also protected by earthen ramparts, dry moats and secondary enclosures. In the north was a large flat area, also about 60 meters square, used as a storage of supplies. As it was intended as only a temporary frontline base, Genbao Castle did not have massive stone walls or a huge donjon. Nothing remains of the castle today except for overgrown remnants of the moats and earthenworks. The castle served as the headquarters for Shibata Katsuie during the Battle of Shizugatake, after the broke with Toyotomi Hideyoshi of the question of the succession to Oda Nobunaga.

She had one sister ship, , and the vessels were wooden-hulled ships armed with a battery of sixteen guns. She was ordered as part of a naval expansion program to counter the Danish Navy over the disputed ownership of Schleswig and Holstein. Nymphe was laid down in January 1862, she was launched in April 1863, and she was completed in October that year. Nymphe saw action during the Second Schleswig War against Denmark in 1864 at the Battle of Jasmund. She was heavily engaged by a Danish frigate in the battle, and she received around 70 hits, mostly to her rigging, though she was not seriously damaged. The ship, which had been on a cruise in the Mediterranean Sea, was in the process of being recalled to Germany during the Austro-Prussian War in 1866, and as a result, saw no action during the conflict, but she did see battle with French warships during the Franco- Prussian War in 1870. A French squadron of ironclads had anchored off Danzig, and Nymphe launched a surprise night attack on the idle vessels, though she inflicted no serious damage on the armored French ships. Her attack nevertheless convinced the French admiral that his heavy ships were not useful in a close blockade of German ports, and so they left. In 1871, Nymphe embarked on a major overseas deployment to the Pacific Ocean and East Asia, where her captain conducted negotiations with various governments and she visited numerous cities. She remained abroad until mid-1874, after which she was converted into a training ship for apprentice seamen. She served in that capacity for the next decade, during which she conducted training cruises, usually to the Americas, though in 1882 she toured the Mediterranean Sea. In poor condition and in need of a complete reconstruction by 1885, she was stricken from the naval register in July 1887 and hulked. Nymphe was ultimately sold in 1891 and broken up in Hamburg. Design The two Nymphe- class corvettes were ordered in the early 1860s as part of a program to strengthen the Prussian Navy as the likelihood of a conflict with Denmark over the Schleswig-Holstein Question became increasingly likely. The design for the class was completed in 1861 and work began on both ships the next year. Nymphe was long overall, with a beam of and a draft of forward. She displaced at full load. The ship's crew consisted of 14 officers and 176 enlisted men. She was powered by a single marine steam engine that drove a two-bladed screw propeller, with steam provided by four coal-fired fire-tube boilers, which gave her a top speed of at . She had a cruising radius of at a speed of . Nymphe was equipped with a full ship rig to supplement her steam engine. Nymphe was armed with a battery of ten 36-pounder guns and six 12-pounder guns, all smoothbores mounted on the broadside. In 1869, these guns were replaced with seventeen, and later nineteen, rifled 23-caliber guns. Later in her career, these were reduced to nine guns. Service history Nymphe was ordered on 23 July 1861, the first of the wooden steam corvettes to be built for the Prussian Navy. Her keel was laid down on 25 January 1862 at the K√∂nigliche Werft (Royal Shipyard) in Danzig, and on 23 July her name was decided by an order from the Prussian Navy Department. The completed hull was launched on 15 April 1863 and she was completed for sea trials by late October. During the trials, it was discovered that the Prussian crew members did not have sufficient experience to operate the steam machinery, and so technicians from J Penn & Sons, the British manufacturer of the ship's engines, had to remain aboard to assist them. Nymphe was transferred to Swinem√ºnde to spend the winter months on 25 November, since the port would not remain frozen over as long as Danzig. In addition, as tensions with rose between Denmark and Prussia over the Schleswig-Holstein Question, the move west would allow Nymphe to cooperate with the gunboats based in Stralsund. =Second Schleswig War= Nymphe was commissioned for the first time on 20 February 1864, shortly after the outbreak of the Second Schleswig War against Denmark. She joined the squadron commanded by Kapit√§n zur See (KzS‚ÄîCaptain at Sea) Eduard von Jachmann, whose flagship was the frigate . Nymphes commander was Kapit√§nleutnant (captain lieutenant) Reinhold von Werner. The Danish fleet, which was much more powerful than the Prussian fleet, immediately proclaimed a blockade of the Baltic and North Sea ports of Prussia and the other German states. The Danes began seizing Prussian merchant ships in the area, prompting Admiral Prince Adalbert of Prussia, the commander of the Prussian Navy, to begin plans for an operation against the blockade using Jachmann's squadron. By mid-March, the Prussian ships were ready for action and the ice had receded far enough that Prince Adalbert ordered Jachmann to conduct a reconnaissance of the blockading force on 16 March. Two days before, a Danish squadron consisting of one ship of the line, one screw frigate, and two screw corvettes and commanded by Rear Admiral Edvard van Dockum had arrived off Swinem√ºnde. Arcona and Nymphe patrolled off Greifswald, but the weather was very poor, with snow showers hampering visibility. The Prussian gunboats, led by the paddle steamer , remained closer to Swinem√ºnde. Jachmann spotted three vessels at around 15:30, but there was not enough time before dark to catch them. Instead, Jachmann turned back to Swinem√ºnde, intending to try again the following day. Battle of Jasmund Illustration of the action by Carl Neumann; Nypmhe is at left The next morning, at 07:30, Jachmann took his ships out of the mouth of the Oder, initially steaming east. Unable to locate any Danish warships, the Prussians turned west and, as they approached the island of Greifswalder Oie, lookouts aboard the ships spotted smoke to the northwest at about 13:15. The Prussians continued on toward the island of R√ºgen; off the Jasmund Peninsula, Jachmann's ships encountered Dockum's squadron. There, with Arcona and Nymphe in the lead, Jachmann turned to engage the Danes; Loreley increased speed to join the two corvettes while Jachmann sent the gunboats to the coast of R√ºgen, where they could be used to cover his withdrawal. From further north, Dockum was awaiting the arrival of the steam frigate . At 14:30, Arcona opened fire, targeting the frigate ; a few minutes later, after Sj√¶lland closed to , Dockum turned his flagship to starboard and began firing broadsides at Arcona. Jachmann turned Arcona to starboard as well, having realized the strength of the Danish squadron. He failed to inform the captains of Nymphe and Loreley of his decision to withdraw, and they continued to steam east for several minutes before they conformed to his maneuver. At this time, Dockum shifted fire to Nymphe and scored several hits, including damage to her funnel that reduced her speed temporarily. Dockum attempted to overtake and cut off Nymphe and Loreley from Arcona, but Nymphes crew was able to quickly repair the damage she had sustained, allowing her to increase speed, though she continued to take hits. Nymphe and Loreley came under heavy fire from the pursuing Danish squadron; at 16:00 Loreley broke off to the west toward Stralsund and Dockum allowed her to leave, preferring to continue after Jachmann's corvettes. Both sides continued to score hits on each other until they checked fire at around 16:45 as the range grew too long. By 18:00, Dockum ended the chase and steamed off to the east, allowing Jachmann to return to Swinem√ºnde. In the course of the battle, Nymphe had received 19 hits in the hull and around 50 to her rigging, and her gig was shot away. Though she was the most heavily damaged vessel on either side of the battle, she was never in serious danger, and her crew suffered just two dead and four wounded. Jachmann made several more sorties into the Baltic without encountering any Danish vessels on 19 March, 9 and 14 April, and 6 May. On 6 June, Nymphe participated in a naval review held for King William I in Swinem√ºnde. Jachmann's squadron steamed from there to Pillau on 12 June, remaining there for ten days before returning. On 24 September, she went into the shipyard in Danzig for periodic maintenance, and in mid- November, she moved to the newly-acquired naval base in Kiel to spend the winter. =Austro-Prussian and Franco-Prussian Wars= In early 1865, the Prussian Navy decided to send Nymphe and the gunboat to the Mediterranean Sea. The two ships began a short training cruise to Sonderburg and Wismar, and on 6 August, Nymphe took the gun from Delphin on board in preparation for the voyage to the Mediterranean to improve the gunboat's seakeeping. Once they arrived in the Aegean Sea on 22 September, Nymphe transferred the gun back to Delphin. The cruise was cut short in March 1866, as both vessels were ordered to return to Prussia as tensions with the Austrian Empire began to mount. The ships arrived in the new naval depot in Geestem√ºnde in mid-July, by which time the Austro-Prussian War had broken out and been decided at the Battle of K√∂niggr√§tz. Nymphe joined the North Sea Flotilla, but with the war all but over she saw no action. The flotilla was dissolved on 29 September and Nymphe went to Geestem√ºnde, where she was decommissioned on 31 March 1867. On 16 April, the ship was moved to the Baltic, visiting Kiel and Danzig, where she entered the K√∂nigliche Werft for extensive repairs to her boilers. Nymphe remained out of service until the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in July 1870, when she returned to service as part of the general mobilization of what was now the North German Federal Navy. On 21 July, she was assigned to the defenses of Neufahrwasser that protected Danzig. The following month, a French squadron consisting of three ironclads and an aviso under Admiral √âdouard Bou√´t-Willaumez arrived off Danzig and anchored in the Putziger Wiek at around 18:00, on the western end of the Danziger Bucht. Nymphes commander, Korvettenkapit√§n (KK‚ÄîCorvette Captain) Weickhmann, decided to make a surprise attack the next morning. At midnight on 22 August, he sortied and began a slow approach to the French squadron, which remained at anchor overnight. At 01:15, Nymphe came within sight of the French ships, and at a distance of , she turned to port and engaged the French squadron. Accounts differ on the details of the action; the historians Hildebrand, R√∂hr, and Steinmetz state that she fired a broadside at the French ironclad before turning to starboard to fire another broadside, inflicting no damage. But Alfred Stenzel, who was an officer in the North German Federal Navy at the time, reported in an 1899 account that Nymphe fired two broadsides at Bou√´t-Willaumez's flagship, the ironclad before turning to flee with Th√©tis in pursuit. Regardless, Nymphe escaped and the French vessels could not get underway quickly enough to catch her. By 03:00, Nymphe was safely behind the coastal fortifications at Neufahrwasser. Bou√´t-Willaumez decided that the attack demonstrated that the large ironclads couldn't be effectively used close to shore, and that smaller, shallower-draft vessels would be necessary. He therefore took his ships away from Danzig, which Nymphe confirmed by a reconnaissance to Rixh√∂ft. At this point, the North German naval command decided to embark on a commerce raiding strategy to attack French merchant shipping in the Atlantic Ocean. Nymphe was deemed to be too slow for the task, and so she was decommissioned on 25 August so her crew could be transferred to the faster corvette , which entered service in late October. =Overseas deployment= Nymphe remained in reserve through the end of the war, when she was recommissioned under command of KK Louis von Blanc on 1 June 1871 to relieve her sister ship , which had been blockaded by French warships in Japan during the war. Nymphe left Kiel on 25 July and made a stop in Cowes, where she was visited by the British royal family. She reached Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on 14 October, where she stayed for two weeks. During this period, some of her crew were in a local restaurant when a fight broke out between them and some pro-French civilians; the sailors were arrested by the Brazilian police, which prompted the German government to consider sending a squadron of warships to coerce their release. In response to the threatened naval deployment, the Brazilian authorities released the men, allowing Nymphe to proceed with her voyage on 27 October. While in South Africa, nine members of her crew deserted to join a diamond rush; Nymphe quickly left port on 22 November after the desertion to prevent any others from joining them. After crossing the Indian Ocean, she visited several ports in Australia and then sailed north into Oceania and visited several islands that had not yet been visited by German vessels. These included the town of Levuka in Fiji in early March 1872, where Blanc negotiated a protection agreement, which was rejected by German chancellor Otto von Bismarck. On 15 March, Nymphe arrived in Apia in Samoa, where Blanc helped to settle disputes between German merchants and chiefs on the islands. She left the islands at the end of the month and arrived in Yokohama, Japan on 20 April, where she met the frigate , the other member of the East Asia station. Nymphe then began a tour of Japanese and Russian ports, including Nagoya, Japan, which had recently been opened to foreign ships, before stopping in Hong Kong on 25 December. Nymphe visited Singapore in March 1873, after which a large portion of her crew became ill. She then went to Borneo to enforce German demands for financial compensation for a German company. Nymphe then visited Jolo in the Sulu Archipelago, then part of the Spanish Empire, where Sultan Jamal ul-Azam requested that Germany sign a protectorate agreement, since he wished to declare independence from Spain. Blanc passed the request on to Berlin, where it was rejected by Bismarck. On 11 April, she returned to Singapore; Blanc and a contingent from the ship traveled overland to Bangkok, Siam, where they delivered the Order of the Black Eagle to the King of Siam, Chulalongkorn. Nymphe left Singapore on 16 May to begin a survey for a potential German coaling station in the South China Sea. She surveyed the Anambas Islands, but these proved to be unusable, as did Hainan, which lacked a suitable harbor. Nymphe also examined the Chusan Archipelago, but it too lacked a usable harbor. Nymphe left Chinese waters on 10 October to return to Yokohama. There, Blanc began preparations to open a hospital for German naval and merchant sailors, which was opened in 1878. The ship received the order to return to Germany on 12 September, and she crossed the Pacific to San Francisco, United States, before steaming south, rounding Cape Horn on 11 February 1874. While passing into the Baltic, the ship ran aground on a rock off Langeland, and she had to be pulled free by a pair of gunboats. Nymphe arrived in Kiel on 12 May and was decommissioned there eight days later. =Later career= Loading the guns on the Nymphe 1872 Nymphe was recommissioned on 1 June for use as a training ship for Schiffsjungen (apprentice seamen). She initially embarked on a cruise in the Baltic with the brigs and before carrying Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia to visit the kings of Denmark and Sweden. She participated in a fleet review for now Kaiser Wilhelm I on 19 September. She moved to Danzig, where she was decommissioned for an overhaul on 15 October. This work was completed by late 1875, and she returned to service on 1 April 1876 for training ship duties. Nymphe embarked on a major training cruise to North and South America, ranging as far north as Halifax, Canada and as far south as Montevideo, Uruguay. While in Uruguay, she steamed up the Uruguay River to Paysand√∫, where a memorial for the German consul, who had been murdered several years earlier, was dedicated with military honors. The ship arrived back in Kiel on 10 September 1877, where she was decommissioned on the 27th. The ship was reactivated on 1 January 1878 to begin the next year's training routine. She began the overseas training cruise in mid-July, and it repeated the destination of the previous year's cruise, though this time she only went as far south as Rio de Janeiro. In January 1879, she stopped in several ports in Venezuela to protect Germans during a period of unrest in the country. She carried a Venezuelan government delegation from Puerto Cabello to La Guaira to negotiate with the rebels there. She was replaced by the ironclad , allowing her to continue her training cruise. She returned to Kiel on 12 September; six days later, while Admiral Albrecht von Stosch, the Chief of the Kaiserliche Admiralit√§t (Imperial Admiralty), was visiting the ship in Wiker Bucht, she was driven aground by a sudden gust of wind. Stosch had to be taken ashore by a boat, while Nymphe was pulled free by another vessel. The ship was decommissioned in Danzig on 30 September for repairs and a re-boilering. On 3 April 1880, Nymphe was recommissioned and began training cruises in the Baltic. She began the overseas cruise on 12 July; on the way out, she stopped in Copenhagen, Denmark, where Danish naval officers visited the ship. Unlike in previous years, the training cruise was for the most part limited to the West Indies. She made a stop in Puerto Cabello, where she was visited by the President of Venezuela, Antonio Guzm√°n Blanco. On the way back to Germany, she stopped in Hampton Roads, United States, where she was visited by the family of President James A. Garfield. She was decommissioned in Danzig on 3 October and she remained out of service for the next year and a half. On 1 April 1882, she was reactivated for another training cruise, which this year went to the Mediterranean to strengthen the German naval forces in the region during the 'Urabi revolt in Egypt. Nymphe left Kiel on 15 July and visited several ports in the Levant, stopped in Suda Bay, Crete, and had to go to Malta since a number of her crew were sick. An outbreak of typhoid fever prompted a second stay in Malta in December, and this time, the entire crew disembarked in Valletta so the ship could be disinfected. The ship was out of service owing to the fever until 26 February 1883, after which she visited numerous Greek ports; while in Piraeus, she was visited by the Greek king, George I. She then began the voyage back to Germany, and on the way she stopped in Lisbon, Portugal, where she was visited by the King of Portugal, Lu√≠s I. Nymphe arrived in Kiel on 6 September and she was decommissioned there on 29 September. The ship conducted short training cruises in the Baltic and took part in training exercises with the main fleet in June 1884. On 16 July, she began the next major cruise to the West Indies, during which she stayed in Sabanilla, Colombia, from late February to late March 1885. Her presence was necessitated by a revolution in the country that threatened German interests. She returned to Germany in early September and joined fleet exercises in the North and Baltic Seas. The ship was decommissioned for the last time on 7 October. Nymphe was worn out by this time, and it was determined that further use would require a complete rebuilding of the vessel's wooden hull, so she was stricken from the naval register on 21 July 1887 and thereafter used as a hulk for machinist training in Kiel. In 1891, she was sold for scrap and broken up in Hamburg.

She was the second and final member of the , ordered as part of a naval expansion program to counter the Danish Navy over the disputed ownership of Schleswig and Holstein. Medusa was laid down in February 1862, was launched in October 1864, and was completed in September 1865. She had one sister ship, , and the vessels were wooden-hulled ships armed with a battery of sixteen guns. Medusa went on two major overseas cruises during her career, the first to the Mediterranean Sea in 1867‚Äì1868 during the Cretan Revolt against Ottoman rule. The second, lengthier voyage lasted from 1868 to 1871, and centered on operations in East Asia. There, she protected individuals from the German states in Japan during the final stage of the Boshin War, helped to suppress Chinese pirates, and visited numerous ports to show the flag. After the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, Medusa was trapped in Yokohama, Japan by a French squadron blockading the port; as a result, she saw no action during the conflict. After returning to unified Germany in 1872, Medusa was converted into a training ship, a role she filled for the next eight years. During this period, she went on a number of training cruises, both in the Baltic Sea and longer voyages to North, Central, and South America, as well as the Mediterranean. She helped to monitor tensions in the Balkans in the mid-1870s and helped to secure restitution for the murder of a German diplomat in Salonika. Worn out by 1880 and in need of a thorough overhaul, the navy instead decided to remove the ship from service, using her as a hulk until 1891, when she was sold for scrap. Design The two Nymphe-class corvettes were ordered in the early 1860s as part of a program to strengthen the Prussian Navy as the likelihood of a conflict with Denmark over the Schleswig- Holstein Question increased. The design for the class was completed in 1861 and work began on both ships the next year. Medusa was long overall, with a beam of and a draft of forward. She displaced at full load. The ship's crew consisted of 14 officers and 176 enlisted men. She was powered by a single marine steam engine that drove a 2-bladed screw propeller, with steam provided by four coal-fired fire-tube boilers, which gave her a top speed of at . She had a cruising radius of at a speed of . Medusa was equipped with a full ship rig to supplement her steam engine. Medusa was armed with a battery of ten 36-pounder guns and six 12-pounder guns, all on the broadside. In 1869, these guns were replaced with seventeen, and later nineteen, 23-caliber guns. Later in her career, these were reduced to nine guns. Service history Medusa was ordered in 1861, and her name was assigned by an order from the Prussian Navy Department on 23 July 1861, before work began on the vessel. Her keel was laid down on 6 February 1862 at the K√∂nigliche Werft (Royal Shipyard) in Danzig, but work proceeded slowly owing to budgetary disputes between the Landtag (State Diet) and the Prussian Minister of War, Albrecht von Roon, who was also the naval minister. In addition, the navy wanted to use the experience gained in building her sister ship during the construction of Medusa. These issues were pushed aside by the outbreak of the Second Schleswig War against Denmark in early 1864, since new warships were needed to counter the significantly stronger Danish fleet. On 20 October, Medusa was launched, though the war ended ten days later. Fitting-out work then commenced, and the ship was ready to begin sea trials on 15 September 1865, which were conducted between Danzig and Swinem√ºnde and lasted to the end of the month. =First overseas deployment= The navy planned to send Medusa on an expedition to the North Pole, but it abandoned the plan, and Medusa remained out of service through 1866, including during the Austro-Prussian War. On 10 April 1867, the ship was finally commissioned; this was followed by more sea trials from 15 to 22 May, after which she conducted training exercises that lasted until 25 August. These exercises were at times in company with the frigate . After the outbreak of the Cretan Revolt in 1866, what was now the North German Federal Navy decided to send a squadron to the Mediterranean Sea to protect German interests on the island and in the surrounding area. Medusa, Hertha, and the gunboat were assigned to the unit. Before they left, Medusa was fitted with an experimental oven to allow her crew to bake fresh bread during the deployment in the interest of improving the crew's rations, rather than relying entirely on hardtack. The three ships left Kiel on 14 September 1867; the first leg of the trip, to Portsmouth, Britain, saw the ships carry a crew for the new ironclad , which had just been completed there. After depositing the crew to take Kronprinz back to Germany, Medusa, Hertha, and Blitz continued on to the Mediterranean. In late October, Medusa and Blitz arrived off Crete to participate in an international squadron to protect the local Greek civilians from the occupying Ottoman Army, but the necessity for their presence soon ended. The North German chancellor, Otto von Bismarck, initiated a conference between the Great Powers in Paris, France to avoid a wider war over the island. On 8 December, the three German ships met in Smyrna in the Ottoman Empire, and in early January 1868, the squadron commander, Kapit√§n zur See (KzS‚ÄîCaptain at Sea) Eduard Heldt went to visit the Ottoman government in Constantinople. This required passage through the Dardanelles and the Sea of Marmara, which were closed to large foreign warships, so Heldt had to transfer to Medusa for the voyage. From 12 to 24 January, Medusa began a tour of the Aegean Sea. The Mediterranean squadron was recalled on 16 February owing to increased tensions with France. Medusa initially stopped in Alexandria in Egypt before making the voyage home. She arrived back in Kiel in mid-April, and was scheduled to be equipped immediately for a deployment to East Asia, but the planned assignment was cancelled and she was instead decommissioned in Kiel on 15 May. =Second overseas deployment= Medusa was recommissioned on 20 August and was transferred to Danzig, though on 25 September she moved back to Kiel. She was sent to assist the Russian frigate , which had run aground off Aarhus, but she was recalled before arriving when it became clear that the ship was beyond salvaging. On 20 October, she left Germany for an extended cruise abroad. She reached Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on 15 December, where she was visited by Emperor Pedro II. Medusa continued the voyage on 3 January 1869, crossing the Indian Ocean and stopping at the island of √éle Saint-Paul on 14 February. She sailed on to Batavia in the Dutch East Indies, where she met the Bremen-flagged full-rigged ship Adele, which had caught fire and burned badly. Medusa towed Adele to Singapore, where the crew could return home. alt=refer to caption On Medusas arrival in Singapore, the East Asia Station, which the Navy Department had ordered established in 1867, could finally be created. Medusa initially served as the flagship of the squadron until her long-time consort Hertha arrived on 12 February 1870 to take over that function. In the meantime, Medusa was first tasked with searching for an appropriate location for a coaling station that could be used to support the German squadron; she examined Blair's Harbour on the Malay Peninsula, the Ryukyu Islands, and the Got≈ç Islands. After returning to Singapore, Medusa received news from the German ambassador to Japan, Max von Brandt, that the Japanese had begun persecuting Europeans in the country, and that her presence was necessary to protect them. She left Singapore on 16 May 1869 and stopped briefly in Hong Kong, where she was present for the official renaming of the Prussian embassy there to the North German embassy, before continuing to Japan. She reached Hakodate in early June, where her crew observed the destruction of the former Prussian corvette , which had been sold to the Tokugawa Shogunate and renamed Kaiten. Medusa sailed to Yokohama and then to Edo, where on 19 August she joined an international fleet of warships organized to pressure the Japanese Meiji government, then in the closing days of the Boshin War, to suppress the attacks on Europeans in the country. Medusa, being one of the shallower-draft vessels of the fleet, anchored close to shore, near the Japanese ironclad . Negotiations were successfully completed the next day, and Medusa sailed back to Yokohama. She was caught in a typhoon while en route and was badly damaged when a barque was driven into her by the strong winds. During the storm, the United States sloop was also seriously damaged, and Medusa came to her aid; her crew were thanked by President Ulysses S. Grant for their actions. Medusa was under repair in Yokohama until late October. Pirate attacks in Chinese waters drew Medusa there after repairs were completed; at the request of the German ambassador in Peking, she operated with British warships to track down pirates attacking European merchant ships. A German barque, Apenrade, that was carrying a load of tea to New York had been attacked off Macao by a pirate junk. Medusa went there on 15 November to track down the pirates; on reaching Apenrade, the Germans discovered that her captain had been injured and a sailor had been killed, but most of her cargo remained, as the pirates had been scared off by the approach of another vessel. Apenrade went back to Macao, and Medusa began the search, along with one Portuguese, one United States, and two Chinese gunboats. The Portuguese gunboat captured the junk, sank it, and carried the crew to Canton, where they were tried and executed for their crime. During the search, Medusa found and arrested another group of pirates who had recently attacked a British barque. Medusas commander sent a report back to Berlin requesting the permanent stationing of gunboats in the region to help combat the pirates, and as a result, Hertha was dispatched to join his ship. Medusa remained in Hong Kong through the end of January 1870, at which point she went to Bangkok, Siam, where she participated in ceremonies commemorating the death of the King of Siam, Mongkut. She also helped mediate a dispute over the sinking of a German merchant vessel in the Mekong River. On 10 April, Medusa left Bangkok and stopped in Saigon on the way back to Hong Kong; the ship had suffered a serious accident with her engine, forcing her to stop in the port for repairs. A French merchant vessel carried a badly injured crewman from Medusa back to Toulon, France. The engine could not be repaired in Saigon, so Medusa departed for Yokohama, traveling mostly by sail. She arrived there on 23 July, where she met Hertha. While there, Medusa celebrated \\"Napoleon Day\\", celebrating the anniversary of Napoleon's birth on 15 August, with a French ironclad in the port, neither vessel being aware that the Franco-Prussian War had broken out a month before. Shortly thereafter, a United States steamship arrived with news of the state of war, and the French East Asia Squadron arrived to blockade the German ship in port. Although it prevented Medusa from taking offensive measures against French shipping, the blockade tied down the French squadron and allowed German vessels to largely escape being attacked. During this time the ship's engine was repaired, and she remained in the port until after the war ended, departing Yokohama on in mid-April 1871 after having received the order to return to the now-unified Germany on the second of the month. She steamed south, crossed the Indian Ocean, and then after rounding South Africa, turned north through the Atlantic and finally arrived in Kiel on 26 August. There, she received a thorough inspection before being decommissioned on 10 October; since the Kaiserliche Werft (Imperial Shipyard) in Kiel was not yet ready to repair the ship, she was moved to Danzig in August 1872, where she underwent a thorough overhaul and was converted for use as a training ship for Schiffsjungen (apprentice seamen). =Later career= Medusa was recommissioned on 15 March 1875 in Kiel, where she embarked a contingent of Schiffsjungen. She went on a short training cruise in the Baltic, visiting ports in Norway and Sweden. At the end of August, she embarked on a longer training cruise to South America and the West Indies; the first stops on the cruise included Santos, Brazil and Montevideo, Uruguay. Medusa then steamed north to Barbados, where she arrived on 9 January 1876. While there, she received a secret order from the Kaiserliche Admiralit√§t (Imperial Admiralty). Under the pretext of a search for deserters, Medusa was to leave the West Indies for Lisbon, Portugal. This move would bring her closer to the Mediterranean without openly signaling Germany's intention to respond to uprisings against Ottoman rule in the Balkans. While en route to Lisbon, the ship's crew conducted intensive weapons training to be prepared for hostilities if the use of force proved to be necessary. The ship arrived in Lisbon in mid-February, and on 16 March, Medusa was ordered to leave Lisbon and proceed to Messina in Sicily, where she received further orders to proceed to Salonika in what was then the Ottoman Empire. There, the French and German consuls had been murdered by the local Ottomans. On arriving there on 15 May, Medusa joined an international fleet that eventually included twenty-nine warships; Medusa was initially the only German vessel in the fleet. Her commander and a detachment from the crew went ashore to participate in the funeral for the consuls, after which the captain negotiated with the Ottoman government in Salonika for an indemnity for the murders. Additional German warships arrived in the area, and on 25 June, the armored training squadron with its flagship reached the city, allowing Medusa to be released to return to training duties in mid-July. The rest of the cruise was conducted in the Mediterranean, and on 21 September, she arrived in Kiel, where she was decommissioned nine days later. Medusa returned to service on 4 April 1877 for another year's training program. From April to early July she cruised in the Baltic, which included visits to Swedish ports, before she began preparations for the overseas cruise. On 27 July, she embarked on the voyage, which again went to South and Central American waters. Her tour extended as far south as Rio de Janeiro, and as far north as Saint Thomas in the Danish West Indies, where she stayed from 6 January to 16 February 1878. Here, she received orders to travel to Nicaragua to join the frigate ; Medusa went to Col√≥n, Panama, where an officer from the ship, Unterleutnant zur See (Sublieutenant at Sea) Theodor Harms went ashore to travel overland to investigate the military situation in Nicaragua. Medusa then went to San Juan del Norte, Nicaragua on 16 April, but she made no intervention in the country, and instead began her voyage back to Germany, stopping in several ports in the United States on the way back. Medusa arrived in Kiel on 15 September and was decommissioned there on 28 September. For the last time, Medusa was commissioned on 1 April 1879 for another training program. In May and June, she conducted a cruise in the Baltic, as was the standard routine. Her voyage into the Atlantic began on 15 July, and this year, she visited numerous ports along the eastern coasts of North and South America, as far north as Halifax, Canada, and as far south as Bah√≠a Blanca, Argentina. Other stops included the Antilles islands, La Guaira and Puerto Cabello, Venezuela, Norfolk, United States in May 1880; her last stop was in Halifax from mid-June to mid-July, after which she crossed the Atlantic and arrived back in Kiel on 10 September. On 30 September, the ship was inspected in Kiel and it was determined that further use would require a thorough overhaul, and so instead she was taken to Danzig where she was decommissioned and stricken from the naval register on 5 April 1881. She was used as a hulk until 1891, when she was sold for scrap and broken up.

History Kronprinsessegade 8 was built by Johan Martin Quist for Jeremias Henriques and Jacob Henriques in 1803-1804 . The composer Christoph Ernst Friedrich Weyse lived in an apartment in the building from 1815. In September 1817, a 14-year-old Hans Christian Andersen came to the apartment to pick up the first portaion of a monrtly allowance. It was the result of a fund-raising that Weyse had initiated at a dinner party held by Giuseppe Siboni the previous evening. Weyse moved to a new apartment in the building at No. 36.

The attack took place on the night of 10/11 August 1944 and involved attempts to bomb an oil refinery at Palembang and lay mines to interdict the Musi River. The raid formed part of a series of attacks on Japanese-occupied cities in South East Asia that XX Bomber Command conducted as an adjunct to its primary mission of bombing Japan. The command raided the Japanese city of Nagasaki on the same night as Operation Boomerang. Fifty-four B-29 Superfortress heavy bombers were dispatched from an airfield in British Ceylon on 10 August, of which 39 reached the Palembang area. Attempts to bomb the oil refinery were largely unsuccessful, only a single building being confirmed destroyed. Mines dropped in the river connecting Palembang to the sea sank three ships and damaged four others. British air and naval forces provided search-and-rescue support for the American bombers. The Japanese antiaircraft guns and fighter aircraft assigned to defend Palembang failed to destroy any of the American bombers, but one B-29 ditched when it ran out of fuel. This was the only USAAF raid on the strategically important oil facilities at Palembang, but they were attacked by aircraft operating from British aircraft carriers in January 1945. Background At the time of the Pacific War, the Sumatran city of Palembang in the Dutch East Indies was a major oil production center. The city and its oil refineries were captured by Japanese forces in mid-February 1942 during the Battle of Palembang. Dutch engineers attempted to wreck the oil refineries during the invasion to prevent the Japanese from being able to use them, but production was restarted by the end of 1942. In early 1944, Allied intelligence estimated that the Pladjoe (Plaju) refinery at Palembang was the source of 22 percent of Japan's fuel oil for ships and industrial facilities, and 78 percent of its aviation gasoline. In late 1943, the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff approved a proposal to begin the strategic air campaign against the Japanese home islands and East Asia by basing B-29 Superfortress heavy bombers in India and establishing forward airfields in China. The main element of this strategy, designated Operation Matterhorn, was to construct airstrips near Chengdu in inland China which would be used to refuel B-29s traveling from bases in Bengal en route to targets in Japan. Operation Matterhorn was to be conducted by the Twentieth Air Force's XX Bomber Command. The head of the USAAF, General Henry H. Arnold, directly commanded the Twentieth Air Force as he had established it as an independent strategic bombing force which reported to the Joint Chiefs of Staff rather than the combat theater commanders in the Pacific. Brigadier General Kenneth Wolfe led XX Bomber Command. XX Bomber Command conducted its first combat mission, against Bangkok, on 5 June 1944. During this operation, two B-29s ran out of fuel over the Bay of Bengal during the return flight to India and were forced to ditch. Planning Locations of B-29 bomber bases in India and Ceylon and the main targets they attacked in South East Asia The attack on Palembang arose from debates concerning how to best utilize the B-29s which preceded the approval of Operation Matterhorn. During late 1943 and early 1944, serious consideration was given to initially using the B-29s to attack merchant shipping and oil facilities in South East Asia from bases in northern Australia and New Guinea. The final plan for Operation Matterhorn approved by the Joint Chiefs of Staff in April specified that while XX Bomber Command would focus on Japan, it was to also attack Palembang. These raids were to be staged through airfields in British Ceylon. The inclusion of Palembang in the plan represented a compromise between the strategists who wanted to concentrate the force against Japan and those who wished to focus it on oil targets. For planning purposes, the date for the first attack on Palembang was set at 20 July 1944. Infrastructure works were undertaken in Ceylon to support the planned raids on Palembang. In March 1944, work began to modify four airfields on Ceylon to the standards needed for B-29s, RAF China Bay and RAF Minneriya being accorded the highest priority. These two airfields were scheduled to be ready by July. In April, when it became apparent that both could not be completed in time, it was decided to concentrate on China Bay. This airfield was capable of accommodating 56 B-29s by mid-July and was fully operational by the time Operation Boomerang was conducted. Shortly after XX Bomber Command's first attack on Japan, made against Yawata on the night of 15/16 June, Arnold pressed Wolfe to attack Palembang as part of the follow-up raids. In his reply, Wolfe noted that it would not be possible to do so until 15 July, when the airfield at China Bay was expected to be ready. Arnold issued XX Bomber Command with a new targeting directive on 27 June which specified that 50 B-29s be dispatched against Palembang as soon as the airfield was complete. Wolfe was transferred to a role in the United States on 4 July. Brigadier General LaVern G. Saunders took over the command on a temporary basis. Saunders decided to delay the attack on Palembang until mid- August to enable XX Bomber Command to first make a maximum effort raid on Anshan in China, which Arnold had accorded the highest priority. Preparations =United States= An aerial photo of part of the Pladjoe refinery taken on an unknown date Planning for the attack on Palembang began in May 1944. Due to the very long distance which was to be flown and the need to stage through Ceylon, the operation required more planning and preparations than any of the other raids conducted by XX Bomber Command. USAAF and British Royal Air Force personnel worked together to complete the preparations. The British supplied fuel for the operation and met the costs of upgrading the Ceylon airfields under Reverse Lend-Lease arrangements. RAF China Bay, including its accommodation facilities and transport vehicles, was virtually given over to the USAAF. The RAF also donated whiskey rations to the Americans. The plans for the operation evolved over time. The Twentieth Air Force initially ordered that the attack involve all 112 of XX Bomber Command's aircraft, and be conducted during the day. The command sought to have this directive modified on the grounds that dispatching so many aircraft from a single airfield would mean that the force would need to be separated into several waves. Splitting the force in this way would further complicate the operation, and was considered likely to lead to higher losses. Arnold accepted this argument, and the 27 June targeting directive specified that the attack take place either at dawn or dusk. The meteorologist assigned to the operation recommended that the attack be made at night so that the B-29s could take advantage of favorable tailwinds. XX Bomber Command gained the Twentieth Air Force's agreement for this change. During the period in which the plan was prepared, several US intelligence agencies altered their views regarding the importance of Palembang. The USAAF's Assistant Chief of Air Staff, Intelligence, and the Committee of Operations Analysts judged that the changing tactical situation in the Pacific and heavy losses of Japanese shipping meant that the Pladjoe refinery was no longer of critical importance to the Japanese war effort. XX Bomber Command staff wanted to cancel the mission, which they viewed as a distraction from the main effort against the Japanese steel industry. The Joint Chiefs of Staff continued to require that Palembang be attacked, and Arnold included it in another target directive issued in July. After it was confirmed that the facilities at China Bay would be complete by 4 August, Arnold directed that the raid be conducted by the 15th of the month. The date for the attack was set as 10 August. Several targets were specified. The primary target was the Pladjoe refinery and the secondary target the nearby Pangkalan refinery. The Indarung Cement Plant at Padang was the last resort target for aircraft unable to reach Palembang. Part of the force was tasked with dropping naval mines to interdict the Musi through which all the oil produced at Palembang was shipped. Due to the extreme range from Ceylon to the targets and back ( to Palembang and to where mines were to be dropped into the Musi), the bombers were to be loaded with only of bombs or mines each and have their fuel tanks filled to capacity. Planning for the attack was completed on 1 August. It was designated Operation Boomerang, possibly in the hope that all of the aircraft would return from their long flights. An attack by XX Bomber Command on the Japanese city of Nagasaki was scheduled to take place on the same night as the raid on Palembang. The USAAF official history states that it was hoped that attacking two targets apart would have a psychological impact on the Japanese. =Japanese= The Imperial Japanese Army was responsible for defending the oil fields on Sumatra against air attack. The Palembang Air Defense Headquarters had been formed in March 1943 for this purpose, and initially comprised the 101st, 102nd and 103rd Air Defense Regiments and the 101st Machine Cannon Battalion. Each of the air defense regiments was equipped with twenty Type 88 75 mm AA guns. They may have also each included a machine cannon battery and a searchlight battery. In January 1944 the 9th Air Division was established as part of efforts to strengthen Sumatra's air defenses. The Palembang Air Defense Headquarters had been re-designated the Palembang Defense Unit, and was assigned to the 9th Air Division upon that command's formation. At around this time, the unit was expanded to also include fighter aircraft. The 21st and 22nd Fighter Regiments of the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force were responsible for intercepting Allied aircraft. The 101st, 102nd and 103rd Antiaircraft Regiments and 101st Machine Cannon Battalion remained, and had been supplemented by the 101st Antiaircraft Balloon Regiment which operated barrage balloons. Attack On the afternoon of 9 August, 56 B-29s from the 444th and 468th Bombardment Groups arrived at RAF China Bay after flying from Bengal. The strike force began to take off from China Bay at 4:45p.m. on 10 August. A total of 54 B-29s were dispatched. While one of the aircraft returned to the base 40 minutes after taking off due to engine problems, it was repaired within two hours, and took off again bound for Sumatra. The bombers' journey to Sumatra was uneventful. The aircraft flew individually on a direct course from China Bay to Siberoet island off the west coast of Sumatra. Upon reaching Siberoet, the bombers changed course, and headed for the Palembang area. Several British warships from the Eastern Fleet and RAF aircraft were positioned along this route to rescue the crews of any B-29s which were forced to ditch. Royal Navy vessels involved included the light cruiser , destroyer and submarines and . The submarines were also used as navigation beacons. A total of 31 B-29s attempted to bomb the Pladjoe refinery. It proved difficult for their crews to locate the target, as no lights were showing in Palembang, patchy cloud covered the area and the bomber which had been tasked with illuminating the refinery with flares did not reach the area. Instead, the bombardiers aimed their bombs using radar or visual sightings through breaks in the clouds. American airmen reported seeing some explosions and fires, but strike photos taken from the bombers were indistinct. Eight B-29s descended below the clouds to drop two mines each in the Musi River; the accuracy of this attack was assessed as \\"excellent\\" in a post-attack report. This was the first time B-29s had been used as minelayers. Of the fifteen B-29s which failed to reach the Palembang area, three attacked other targets. A pair of B-29s bombed the oil town of Pangkalanbrandan in northern Sumatra and another struck an airfield near the town of Djambi. Several of the bombers which had to turn back did so after running low on fuel. Japanese forces attacked the B-29s while they were in the Palembang area, without success. Antiaircraft guns and rockets were fired at the bombers, and the American airmen sighted 37 Japanese aircraft. Some of the fighters pursued the bombers for . None of the B-29s were damaged. One of the B-29s ditched into the sea from China Bay on its return flight after running out of fuel. Its crew were able to send an SOS signal before ditching, which led Allied forces to conduct an intensive search of the area. One of the bomber's gunners was killed, and the other members of the crew were rescued on the morning of 12 August. While the Allied planners had expected that several B-29s would need to ditch due to fuel shortages, this proved to be the only loss from the operation. The mission lasted about nineteen hours and the mining of the Musi is considered the longest combat mission of the war. The attack on Nagasaki which was undertaken on the night of 10/11 August in conjunction with Operation Boomerang was unsuccessful. The city was bombed by 24 B-29s, but little damage was inflicted. Two other bombers turned back after departing the forward airfields in China, and three attacked secondary targets. All of the B-29s returned to base. Aftermath An oil refinery at Palembang on fire after being attacked by the British Royal Navy in January 1945 Operation Boomerang produced mixed results. Photos of the Pladjoe refinery taken on 19 September indicated that a single building had definitely been destroyed in the raid, though several others were assessed as \\"probables\\". The mine-laying element of the attack was successful: three ships totalling 1,768 tons were sunk, four others were damaged and the Japanese were unable to transport oil via the Musi River for a month until minesweeping was complete. Subsequently, B-29s frequently laid mines as part of efforts to blockade Japan. Despite the failure of Operation Boomerang to fully achieve its goals, it demonstrated that XX Bomber Command was now capable of conducting complex operations and the B-29s could safely travel long distances over water. XX Bomber Command continued to be reluctant to attack Palembang, and recommended to the Twentieth Air Force on 24 August that its facilities at China Bay be abandoned. Approval to do so was granted on 3 October, though the Twentieth Air Force directed that the aircraft fueling system remain in place. No other B-29 attacks were conducted through Ceylon. The USAAF official history noted that modifying the base for only a single operation was \\"a glaring example of the extravagance of war\\". XX Bomber Command attacked several other cities in South East Asia during 1944 and early 1945; these included multiple raids on Japanese-occupied Singapore which required even longer flights than those to reach Palembang. The Eastern Fleet's aircraft carriers raided oil facilities in Sumatra several times between November 1944 and January 1945. These included two attacks on Palembang conducted as part of Operation Meridian in January 1945. On 24 January the fleet's aircraft badly damaged the Pladjoe refinery, and on the 29th of the month serious damage was inflicted on the nearby Sungai Gerong refinery. The Japanese general who commanded the oil refineries at Palembang stated after the war that these attacks had inflicted much more damage than Operation Boomerang.

It focuses on physicians from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Intended for students and academic researchers with an interest in the history of migration, South Asian studies, oral history and the history of medicine, the book is also of interest to those curious about the links between the British Empire and medical migration. The book sets out to write the history of migration and empire back into the mainstream of British history. It does so by looking at the history of a \\"typically British\\" institution: the National Health Service. Migrant Architects' central argument is that the NHS in its first forty years was built around general practice and that general practice was fundamentally dependent on, and shaped by, medical migration from the Indian subcontinent. Simpson also argues that as South Asian doctors were hugely over-represented in the working class parts of Britain (accounting for 30‚Äì50% of GPs in many inner city and industrial areas) they were key to the NHS being able to deliver its core mission of helping the most vulnerable populations. The book concludes with a call for more histories of how migration and empire shaped Britain, with a view to using these new accounts to directly engage in contemporary political debates around migration. Launch Migrant Architects of the NHS was officially launched at an exhibition based on the research done for the book, at the RCGP on 25 April 2018 in the presence of the chief executive of NHS England, Simon Stevens and RCGP president professor Mayur Lakhani. Both paid tribute to South Asian doctors on the occasion of the approaching 70th anniversary of the NHS. Taking up positions in some of the most deprived regions of Britain between 1940 and the 1980s, South Asian GPs were praised by Lakhani as \\"highly-valued\\" colleagues of the communities in which they practised. Reception The book received international press coverage, particularly in the former British colonies in South Asia from where many doctors moved to work in Britain: * Bangladesh's newspapers, Bangla Tribune and the Dhaka Tribune, both reported on the book and its launch in April 2018. * In India, the Hindustan Times reported on the exhibition and book, commenting that \\"Indian doctors who worked for it [the NHS] over the decades are being hailed not only for their contribution but for their central role in its development\\". * In Sri Lanka, the Sunday Times of Sri Lanka noted the role that physicians from South Asia played in making the British primary care system. * In New Zealand, Virginia McMillan, correspondent for the New Zealand Doctor, accidentally came across Simpson's research on a visit to London, and responded with a parallel narrative of an Indian physician, Sadanand Hegde, who migrated to New Zealand and practiced there as a GP for over thirty-five years. * The inclusion of physicians such as Liverpool's Shiv Pande in the book was welcomed by local politician Richard Kemp.

Club History  The Angaston Football Club was officially 'formed' in 1879 as a founding member of the Barossa & Light Football Association in 1908, playing its first game on 12 July 1879 against the Kapunda Football Club. Kapunda won the game kicking seven goals to nil. Football was initially played in Angaston nine years prior to the club's founding, in 1870. The club took part in trying to create a football association in the late 1800s but the association wasn't formed until 18 March 1908, the Barossa & Light Football Association. Angaston was a founding member of the league and has not missed an official season in its 139-year history. The first official match of the Angaston Football Club was on 2 May 1908, defeating Kapunda 5.11.41 to 5.2.32. The Panthers also won their first premiership in 1908 too. In the early 1900s, Angaston won six premierships until 1915 when World War I broke out and suspended football. But success continued for the club in the 1920s as Angaston won another three premierships and continued to be regarded as one of the best teams in the league by reaching five grand finals and winning four flags in the 1930s. After their successful era of the 1930s, football was suspended again due to World War II. When the local competition started again in 1945, Angaston went on to win another premiership, defeating Kapunda in the grand final but had to wait until 1955 to win another premiership. After their victorious 1955 season, the club suffered a thirteen-year premiership drought before winning back to back premierships in 1968 and 1969, followed by three more in 1971, 1972, and 1973 and another in 1977. The Angaston Panthers FC holds the record for being the only club to have drawn twice in a Grand Final, the first in 1969 against Nuriootpa and winning the replay and again in 1977, drawing with Kapunda and winning the replay. Angaston has won two more A-Grade premierships since 1977, in 1986 and 2003. Angaston has produced several players that have gone on to play in the Australian Football League. These include Kent Kingsley (North Melbourne, Geelong, Richmond), Sean Tasker (Adelaide), Shannon Hurn (West Coast), Sam Colquhoun (Port Adelaide) and Jack Hannath (Fremantle). The Angaston Football Club still continues to field junior and senior teams in the Barossa Light & Gawler Football Association and has won the most premierships in the former Barossa & Light Football Association but have only won one premiership in the current league. Since the 2010s, the club's recent seasons have been quite tough, earning the wooden spoon in 2012, 2013 and 2017.

They usually met in the caf√© Amaury at the corner of the Saint-Cloud avenue and the Carnot street at Versailles, to debate of the Estates General subjects before the constituency debates concerning Brittany of other subjects. Its influence was much greater than its size, and it became later the Soci√©t√© des amis de la constitution, which finally became the Club des Jacobins.  Brittany constituency composition  The Brittany situation differed from the rest of France, because related to the absence of agreement between the different estates, only the Third Estate and the Minor orders were represented in the Estates General. The Britany nobility sent delegates to Versailles to obtain that the election would conform to the old Brittany constitution electoral rules, which stipulated that the delegates would be nominated by the 47 representatives of the 42 towns of the province, excluding small cities and rural areas, without any representatives for the Minor orders. However, the Brittany Third Estate sent its own delegation and was allowed to send its own delegates. The nobility and the Major orders answer was to refuse to elect representatives on 16 April 1789 at Saint-Brieuc. The Minor orders then took their place, and the Third Estate ensured that no nobility could be part of its own representatives.  Extension of the club  The representatives from Brittany were the first to encourage the reunion of the three orders in the Legislative Assembly, arguing that the Third Estate was the only Nation representative, which was agreed on the 17 June 1789. Just before the 20 June 1789, the number of the club personnel was almost 200 people. After the Tennis Court Oath, the Brittany priests joined the club.  Toward the Club des Jacobins  After the transfer of the March on Versailles in October 1789, the club reverted to being a provincial caucus for National Constituent Assembly deputies from Brittany. As of October 1789, the group rented for its meetings the refectory of the monastery of the Jacobins in the Rue Saint-Honor√©, adjacent to the seat of the Assembly. The name Jacobins, given in France to the Dominicans (because their first house in Paris was in the Rue Saint-Jacques), was first applied to the club in ridicule by its enemies.

Biography  Jƒìkabs Bƒ´ne was born in Riga in 1895 in merchant family. He studied at the Riga City Art School (1913-1915), Kharkov Art School (1915-1918) and the Art Academy of Latvia (1921‚Äì1926). His graduation work from JƒÅnis Tilbergs' figurative painting class at the Art Academy was the painting Resurrection. He held teaching positions throughout his life: at the Art Studio of the Latvian People University (1928-1940), Riga People University, Institute of Housekeeping in Kaucminde (1932-1939), at the Riga State Art of Craft School (1933-1944), at the School of the Riga society of painters (1936-1939), at the Art Academy of Latvia (1942-1944), at the Kuldiga Secondary Art School (1944-1951), and at combine \\"Art\\" (1951-1955). His first solo exhibition was held in 1917. In the 1920s he painted Christian subjects, including the altarpieces for the churches in Cesvaine (1924), Jumprava (1926) and Vecsaule (1927). His focus on sacral painting developed into an interest in Latvian mythology, idealism and an ambition to connect art to folk culture and nature. He studied the symbols of Latvian ornamentation and incorporated this in his art. He became involved in Ernests Brasti≈Ü≈°' neopagan movement Dievturƒ´ba and became one of its main public promoters. From 1940 and throughout the Stalinist era, this was repressed as \\"bourgeois art\\". Bƒ´ne's diaries show that he was disappointed with the direction the Soviet authorities had set out for the arts, and that he viewed it as vulgarization. He did however adapt to the new regime. As part of his acceptance of a position as a stained glass specialist in 1951, he wrote a 1952 paper titled Ornament in which he condemned his previous views on Latvian ornamentation.

He studied at the Tbilisi 1st Public School. Tikanadze was a geologist, he graduated from the Tbilisi State University, the faculty of Geography and Geology. Between 1956 and 1959 he worked at the Vakhushti Bagrationi Institute of Geography. Guram Tikanadze was interested in different types of sports; by 1956, he was a first-class boxer. He was in the 7th grade when he became interested in photography and studied at the Tbilisi Pioneer Palace, under the supervision of famous photographers ‚Äì Niko Sagharadze and Sergo Akhvlediani. From 1975 the circle of young photographers was named after Guram Tikanadze. His first success was in 1958, when he published his work, \\"A Song of Water\\". In 1959, he began to work on the \\"Drosha\\" magazine as a photo-reporter. The same year, he received the silver medal for his work, \\"Ole,\\" in Vienna and it became the first international award in the history of Georgian photography. In the same year, he received a bronze medal at the Modena International Photo Contest for his work \\"Tbilisi Sea\\". In 1962, he became the head of the photo-department at the Union of Georgian Journalists in Tbilisi. His works were regularly published in various international publications in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Germany, Italy and Hong Kong. He was a participant in several photo exhibitions. Among his famous photos are: ‚ÄúSweet Melon‚Äù, ‚ÄúMountain Daybreak‚Äù, ‚ÄúMeskhi Attacks‚Äù, ‚ÄúTetnuldi ‚Äì A Bride of Svaneti‚Äù, ‚ÄúUshba‚Äù, ‚ÄúTenzing Norgay‚Äù, ‚ÄúParadox of rain‚Äù, ‚ÄúOld Tbilisi‚Äù, etc. In his works, Guram Tikanadze paired a poetic mode of thinking with journalism. Guram Tikanadze's activities coincided with the so-called ‚ÄúKhrushchev Thaw‚Äù period, when young photographers intentionally ignored the rules of staged photography and were boldly pushing reportage photography forward. Guram Tikanadze greatly contributed to the development of Georgian photography by creating a certain cultural and genetic tradition. Guram Tikanadze was a student when he became interested in Alpinism. During his short life, he managed to climb up to 40 mountaintops. His first was ‚ÄúSpartacus‚Äù in 1952. From 1957 onward, he was climbing grade 5 mountaintops. The first such summit was Mount Garmo in the Pamirs, in 1957. During the period between August and September in 1958, Guram Tikanadze, along with a group of four people, accomplished the most difficult traverse on the main chain of the Central Caucasus. He conquered 14 out of 16 mountaintops and was awarded the silver medal of the Soviet Union (none of the group members received the gold medal). In 1961, he headed a traverse of both mountaintops of [Ushba]. In August 1963, with a sport group that he headed, he conquered Tetnuldi. On August 21, the group reached Shkhara. He died on August 27, while descending the mountain. He hammered a wooden pole into a rock gap, attached a rope to it and began to descend, but the wooden pole slipped from the gap. His body was brought from the mountains on September 1, by a group of mountaineers headed by Beknu Khergiani and Chichiko Chartolani. In 1980, in the Latali village of Svaneti, with the initiative and support of the local population, the Guram Tikanadze Sports Center and Museum was opened.

Early life Taylor was born on 13 May 1921 in Portstewart, Northern Ireland. His parents were Daniel Brumhall Taylor and Anna Martha Taylor ( Rice). He received his education at Coleraine Academical Institution and Queen's University Belfast (QUB). From QUB, he graduated BSc (Mech) in 1942, BSc (Elec) in 1943, MSc in 1946, and obtained his PhD in 1948. In 1956, he graduated MA from the University of Cambridge. Taylor was a member of the Queen's University Belfast Boat Club. He competed in the men's eight event at the 1948 Summer Olympics where the team was eliminated in the repechage. His selection to the team was notable as he was the only member from Northern Ireland; the rest of the team were from the Republic of Ireland. This helped with the Irish Amateur Rowing Union being accepted as a member by the International Rowing Federation (FISA) in September 1948 and ensured that rowing was represented as part of Ireland's inaugural Olympic team; many sports missed out over the dispute by rival Irish sports governing bodies. After completing his PhD, he taught in engineering at the University of Liverpool (1948‚Äì1950) and the University of Nottingham (1950‚Äì1953). He then went to the University of Cambridge where he was an ICI Fellow (1953‚Äì1956), a lecturer in mechanical sciences (1956‚Äì1968), and Fellow of Peterhouse (1958‚Äì1968). During 1963, he was a visiting lecturer at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand. At Peterhouse, he was a coach at the Peterhouse Boat Club and his 1956 team won the Lent Bumps. The rowing club's first eight trained in a shell named Danny Taylor. After this boat got destroyed, Taylor's widow launched a coxed four shell in April 2006 that was to bear her late husband's name. Life in New Zealand In 1968, Taylor was appointed as vice-chancellor of Victoria University of Wellington. His first day, 10 April 1968, coincided with sinking of the TEV Wahine in Wellington Harbour. He was at Victoria during difficult times, with enrolments declining due to increasing competition by the relatively new Massey University, the 1973 oil shocks, the government funding cut of 1976, and the 1981 state sector-wide cut. Taylor was succeeded as vice-chancellor in 1982 by Ian Axford. Taylor had married Elizabeth Page in 1955. They had one son and one daughter. In 1990, they lived in Upper Hutt. His recreational interests were golf and gardening. Taylor died on 31 December 2003 at age 82. He was survived by his wife. His daughter, Ann Elizabeth Taylor, married the physicist Michael Kelly.

History Julia was a daughter of Major Sir Robert Hutchinson Ord (1789‚Äì1828), of Greensted Hall, Essex and his wife Elizabeth Ord (n√©e Blagrave). She married (Anglican) Rev. George Henry Farr, Vicar of St. Wenn's Church in Cornwall, in 1846 after a four-year engagement, the delay being occasioned by her parents' disapproval, the Ords being Plymouth Brethren and in much wealthier circumstances. In 1854 he was offered the position of headmaster of St Peter's College, Adelaide, which he promptly accepted, hoping the drier climate of South Australia would improve her delicate health. George and Julia, their six-year-old daughter Eleanora and Julia's half-sister Edith Bayley sailed to South Australia aboard Daylesford, arriving in Adelaide in July 1854 after a long four-month voyage during which an outbreak of measles affected the children, the ship ran out of provisions, and the captain, missing the entrance to Gulf St Vincent, nearly ran the ship aground at the Murray Mouth. Their first few weeks did not augur well for life in the new colony: the ship's Adelaide agent had gone broke and the captain had to borrow money from passengers before he could continue to Melbourne. The only transportation they could find at the port was an old cart that broke down in Hindley Street and the women had to put up for the night at a temperance hotel (George had been taken to the college the previous day by the government health officer). The next day was Sunday and Julia Farr and Edith Bayley were expected at the 11 am service at the College chapel, but could not find a cab and had to walk the two miles of what must have been rudimentary, and possibly muddy, tracks in their best clothes. The Farrs' accommodation was not yet habitable and they had to board with Mrs Baye, the college matron. Farr was concerned at the plight of orphaned girls who had been committed to the Destitute Asylum, an unsatisfactory situation in many ways. She organised a group of like-minded friends and founded the Church of England's Orphan Home for Girls near the corner of Carrington Street and East Terrace, previously a German hospital, opened in October 1861.This was five years before Emily Clark founded the \\"boarding-out\\" system, finding foster parents for children (boys and girls) held in the Destitute Asylum, initially viewed with suspicion by the Government, then embraced six years later. The girls were looked after, fed, clothed and educated to the age of 14, then most found employment as servants to middle-class households. The first secretary of the Home was H. Kent Hughes, and matron Mrs. Sarah Birt. The Home was relocated to Fullarton Road, Mitcham in 1912. Farr was later concerned with alleviating problems for people with intractable physical problems, and set about establishing the Home for Incurables. A committee was formed in 1878 and a house on Fisher Street, Fullarton was purchased. Over the years, as demand increased, new buildings were added, and wings were appended to those. The complex was demolished in 2011. Julia Farr died at her residence on Barnard street, North Adelaide, after an extended period of ill-health. Her daughter Julia, granddaughter Mary Clift, and great-granddaughter Joan Clift followed her in succession as committee members of the Orphan Home. Other interests The Farrs purchased a property near Tea Tree Gully and built there a holiday house, dubbed \\"Brightlands\\". Dr. William T. Angove initially used Brightlands' extensive cellars to mature his wines before moving to the St. Agnes property. Recognition *Each year the Annual General Meeting of the Church of England Orphan Home for Girls was held on 14 April (Sundays excepted), in recognition of her birthday. *The Orphan Home for Girls at 588 Fullarton Road, Mitcham was named Farr House in 1935. *She was accorded the privilege of, on 13 October 1906, laying the foundation stone of the new wing of the Home for Incurables at 99 Fisher Street, Fullarton. *The Home for Incurables was renamed Julia Farr Centre in 1981.

Thymus tissue is compartmentalized into cortex and medulla and each of these two compartments comprises its specific thymic epithelial cell subset. cTECs reside in the outer part- cortex, which mostly serves as a developmental site for T cells. Precursors of T cells originate in the bone marrow from which they migrate via bloodstream into thymic cortex, where they encounter stromal cells including cTECs, which form the microenvironment crucial for proliferation and development of T cells by expression of DLL4 (delta-like notch ligand 4), cytokines IL-7, TGFŒ≤ or stem cell factor and chemokines CCL25, CXCL12 or CCRL1 etc. Essential part of T cell development forms process called VDJ recombination, mediated by RAG recombinases, that stochastically changes DNA sequences of T cell receptors (TCR) and endows them with diverse recognition specificity. Thanks to this process, T cells can recognize vast repertoire of pathogens, but also self-peptides or even their TCRs don¬¥t respond to any surrounding signals. Major role of thymic epithelial cells is to test, whether TCRs are \\"functional\\" and on the other hand \\"harmless\\" to our body. While cTECs control the functionality of TCRs during the process called positive selection, Medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) that home in the inner part of the thymus- medulla, present on their MHC molecules self- peptides, generated mostly by protein Autoimmune regulator, to eliminate T cells with self-reactive TCRs via processes of central tolerance e.g. negative selection and protect the body against development of autoimmunity.  Positive selection of T cells  Major function of cTECs is to positively select those T cells that are capable to recognize and interact with MHC molecules on their surface . Once T cell precursors enter the thymic cortex, they start their transformation from double negative stages (T cell without surface expression of CD4 and CD8 co-receptors) to a double positive stage (T cell with surface expression of both co-receptors) that expresses fully recombined TCR. This stage undergoes above mentioned selection process. = Double positive‚Äìsingle positive transition = Interaction between TCR of double positive T cell and MHC I molecule leads to loss of CD4 expression and double positive T cell becomes CD8 single positive T cell, conversely, engagement of MHC II molecule leads to the development into CD4 single positive T cell. It was also described that CD8/CD4 restriction is influenced by transcription factors Runx3, in the case of CD8 restriction, and Th-POK which directs the development into CD4 T cell lineage and represses the expression of Runx3. More than 90% of double positive T cells are unable to reach this interaction and they die by neglect. = Cortex‚Äìmedulla migration = Besides double positive-single positive transition, TCR-MHC interaction also triggers the expression of CCR7, chemokine receptor which recognizes chemokines CCL19 and CCL21, that are largely produced by mTECs in the medulla, and positively selected T cells start to migrate to medulla via their gradient.  Unique proteolytic pathways  It is incompletely understood whether presence of peptide ligands on MHC molecules of cTECs plays some role in positive selection. But it is likely that these peptide-MHC complexes are unique and different from self-peptides presented by mTECs, since cTECs developed unique proteolytic pathways. Indeed, there is slight evidence focused on unique cTEC peptide ligands, nevertheless, its more systematic characterization is still required. = Thymoproteasome (Œ≤5t) = Enzymatic machinery for MHC I antigen processing and presentation in cTECs involves thymoproteasome, which is defined by the presence of Œ≤5t subunit encoded by Psmb11 gene. Knockout of this gene revealed only slight reduction in positive selection of CD8 T cells, but TCR repertoire of these cells was shown to be limited and they revealed impaired immunological properties e.g. bad antigen responsiveness and failure to maintain naive population in the periphery. Œ≤5t subunit was shown to reduce chymotrypsin-like activity of thymoproteasomes, resulting in generation of low affinity peptides. Such finding was confirmed by study that was focused on properties of thymoproteasome- chopped peptides. Importantly, low affinity interactions are considered to result in positive selection, whereas high affinity interactions are typical for negative selection and interaction with mTECs. = Cathepsin L = MHC II processing and presentation in cTECs tooks advantage of several proteolytic pathways including cathepsin L, encoded by Ctsl gene. Cathepsin S which is produced by most of the antigen- presenting cells along with mTECs is absent in cTECs. Cathepsin L not only cleaves invariant chain as other cathepsins, nevertheless was shown to cleave peptides for MHC II presentation and enlarge the pool of cTEC unique peptide ligands. Ctsl knockout mouse revealed severe reduction in frequency and repertoire of CD4 T cells and impairment of invariant chain degradation. Another study revealed that reduction of T cell repertoire wasn¬¥t caused by absence of invariant chain degradation, rather due to alterations in repertoire of cathepsin L cleaved peptides. = Thymus specific serine protease = Thymus specific serine protease is another cTEC specific enzyme, encoded by Prss16 gene, which is also involved in MHC II peptide processing. Prss16 knockout mice revealed reduced repertoire of positively selected CD4 T cells. = Macroautophagy = Common feature of cTECs and mTECs is constitutive macroautophagy. This process involves engulfment of portion of cytoplasm that contains organelles and vesicles into autophagosome that fuses with late endosomes or lysosomes and its content is chopped to small peptides. cTECs and mTECs utilize this endogenous pathway for MHC II presentation during selection processes, instead of common loading of exogenous peptides. Mouse with deficient macroautophagy, specifically in the thymus, revealed reduced numbers and repertoire of CD4 T cells.  Development  cTECs and mTECs originate from endoderm, more specifically from the third pharyngeal pouch and it has been shown that they share common progenitor cell. Importantly, mTECs during their development possess classical markers of cTECs including CD205 and Œ≤5t which are completely absent in mature mTECs, suggesting another possible cTEC function, namely they might serve as a progenitor cell reservoir for mTECs. Indeed, several lineage tracing studies confirmed that cTEC progenitors or even mature cTECs are capable to give rise to mTECs. Nevertheless, there is available series of publications which suggests different mTEC progenitor pools or even argue that cTECs and mTECs reveal distinct unipotent progenitor cells.

As a juvenile she made an immediate impact, winning the Group 1 Prix Marcel Boussac on her second start and being rated the best filly of her generation trained in England. In the following year she missed the first half of the season through injury and then ran well in several major races before ending her season by winning the Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Turf. In 2018 she won the Dahlia Stakes on her only appearance before her racing career was ended by injury. Background Wuheida is a chestnut mare with a broken white blaze who was bred by Sheikh Mohammed's Darley Stud and raced in the colours of the Sheikh's Godolphin organisation. She was trained by Charlie Appleby, whose stable is based at Newmarket, Suffolk, but typically relocates to Dubai in winter. She was sired by Dubawi a top-class son of Dubai Millennium, whose wins included the Irish 2,000 Guineas and the Prix Jacques Le Marois. At stud, Dubawi has been a highly-successful breeding stallion, siring major winners such as Monterosso, Al Kazeem, Makfi, Lucky Nine and Night of Thunder. Wuheida's dam Hibaayeb was a top-class racemare whose wins included the Fillies' Mile, Ribblesdale Stakes and Yellow Ribbon Stakes. She was descended from Oh So Fair, an influential broodmare whose other descendants have included Oh So Sharp, Shantou, Collier Hill, Roussalka and Ameerat. Racing career =2016: two-year-old season= Wuheida began her racing career in a seven furlong maiden race at Newmarket Racecourse on 6 August in which she started the 15/8 favourite and won by one and a quarter lengths from Spatial. For her next appearance the filly was sent to France and moved up sharply in class to contest the Group 1 Prix Marcel Boussac over 1600 metres at Chantilly Racecourse on 2 October. She started at odds of 10/1 in an eleven-runner field which included Dabyah (the 3/1 favourite), Promise To Be True (Silver Flash Stakes), Toulifaut (Prix d'Aumale) and Cavale Doree (Prix du Calvados). Ridden by William Buick, Wuheida was among the leaders from the start as Dabyah set the pace and then made a forward move in the straight. She went to the front 120 metres from the finish and won by three quarters of a length and a short neck from Promise To Be True and Dabyah. In the official European Classification of two-year-olds for 2016 Wuheida was given a rating of 114, making her the best two-year-old filly trained in Britain (alongside Queen Kindly) and the fifth-best juvenile filly in Europe, behind Lady Aurelia, Brave Anna, Rhododendron and Roly Poly. =2017: three-year-old season= A training setback in spring ruled Wuheida out of both the 1000 Guineas and Epsom Oaks. She eventually returned in the Falmouth Stakes at Newmarket on 14 July and finished second of the seven runners behind Roly Poly. The filly was then sent to Germany and stated favourite for the Preis der Diana over 2200 metres at D√ºsseldorf on 6 August, but after leading in the straight she was overtaken in the closing stages and finished third behind Lacazar and Megera. On 9 September she came home fourth behind Hydrangea, Winter and Persuasive in a strongly-contested running of the Matron Stakes with Qemah, Roly Poly and Rhododendron among the beaten horses. The Prix de l'Op√©ra at Chantilly on 1 October resulted in a \\"blanket finish\\" with Wuheida taking fourth place, beaten a head, a neck and a neck again by Rhododendron, Hydrangea and Lady Frankel. For her final run of the year, Wuheida was sent to California for the Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Turf at Del Mar Racetrack on 4 November, in which she was ridden by Buick and started at odds of 8/1. Lady Eli started favourite, while the other twelve runners included Rhododendron, Queen's Trust (winner of the race in 2016) and Senga. Buick tracked the pace-setting Zipessa before sending Wuheida to the front as the field exited the final turn. The filly stayed on strongly in the closing stages and won by a length from Rhododendron, with third place going to the outsider Cambodia. After the race Buick said \\"She's a push-button ride. I could send her forward from the gate and get her into a nice rhythm, and the trip was never a concern. I was very happy throughout and I had plenty of horse and I could go where I wanted. It was a case of don‚Äôt get too excited and don‚Äôt go too soon.\\" In the 2017 World's Best Racehorse Rankings Wuheida was given a rating of 117, making her the 129th best racehorse in the world and the seventh best three-year-old filly. =2018: four-year-old season= Wuheida began her third season in the Group 2 Dahlia Stakes over nine furlongs at Newmarket on 6 May. Starting the 10/11 favourite, she took the lead two furlongs out drew right away from her opponents to win \\"easily\\" by four lengths from Wilamina. Shortly after her win in the Dahlia Stakes, Wuheida suffered a recurrence of her earlier injury and was retired from racing. Appleby commented \\"I am pleased she went out on a high with such an emphatic win at Newmarket.

Sitting : Anatoliy Keltchevski, Vladimir Sidorin and Lieutenant- General Konstantin Mamontov. (The cross over Mamontov's head was drawn by the photographer after he died.) Vladimir Ilyich Sidorin (February 3, 1882 ‚àí May 20, 1943) was an officer in the Russian Imperial Army and Commander of the Don Army between February 1919 and April 1920 during the Russian Civil War.  Biography  He was born in the village of Esaulovskaya in the 2nd Don district of the Don Cossack Region. His father was Ilya Sidorin, an officer of the Don Army and his uncle was General Leonty Sidorin, shot by the Bolsheviks in February 1918. Vladimir Sidorin participated in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904‚àí1905. From November 26, 1912 to 1914 he was senior adjutant of the headquarters of the 3rd Caucasus Army Corps. During the First World War, he first served as an officer at the headquarters of the 21st Infantry Division. In 1915 he became Chief of staff of the 2nd militia division and from July 12 of the 102nd Infantry Division. He was Deputy Chief of Staff of the Second Army from March 1916 to March 1917 and Chief of Staff of the 3rd Caucasus Army Corps from April to June 1917, when he was put at the disposal of the Chief of Staff of the Western Front. After the October revolution, he returned to the Don and took part in the White movement. First he joined the Cossack detachment of Novocherkassk and participated in the battle for Rostov in November‚àíDecember 1917. Then he became Chief of Staff of the Don Cossack Army, under command of General Anatoly Nazarov. Later he was also Chief of Staff under General Pyotr Popov (April 25‚àíMay 18, 1918), when he took part in the Steppe March. From May 12, 1918 to February 2, 1919, he was in the reserve of the Don Army. On February 15, 1919 he succeeded General Svyatoslav Denisov as Commander of the Don Army. He held the post until March 27, 1920, when the Don Army was renamed the Don Corps, of which he also became commander. After conducting many battles against the Red Army, he participated in the disastrous Evacuation of Novorossiysk. On April 18, 1920, shortly after his arrival from Novorossiysk to Evpatoria in the Crimea, he was brought to trial along with Lieutenant-General Kelchevsky, chief of staff of the Don Army. He was charged for separatist speeches, his support for the striving of the Don Cossacks to separate the Don from Russia and the spontaneous withdrawal of the Don Corps to Novorossiysk in the winter of 1919‚àí1920. The court, chaired by General Abram Dragomirov, sentenced the generals Sidorin and Kelchevsky to four years of hard labor. General Pyotr Wrangel replaced the verdict with dismissal from the Russian Army without the right to wear a uniform.  Emigration  General Sidorin was appointed Governor of Sevastopol (Russia) but emigrated from the Crimea one month later in May 1920 and went into exile: first in Bulgaria, then Serbia, then Czechoslovakia in 1924 and finally in Germany in 1939. In Prague he served in the cartographic department of the General Staff of the Czechoslovak Army. Together with General Starikov, he co- wrote numerous articles on the history of the Don Army during the Civil War. These articles were regularly published in the journal \\"Free Cossacks\\" (1936-1938) published in Paris by IA Bily. Under the title \\"The tragedy of the Cossacks\\", these articles were published in a separate book in four parts in 1936-1938 in Paris (without mentioning the names of the authors). At the beginning of the Second World War, General Sidorin left for Germany. He died in Berlin on May 20, 1943 and was buried in the Berlin-Tegel Russian Orthodox Cemetery (4th quarter, 12th row, grave No. 18). , Source * This is a translation of an article in the Russian Wikipedia, –°–∏–¥–æ—Ä–∏–Ω, –í–ª–∞–¥–∏–º–∏—Ä –ò–ª—å–∏—á.

Biography Born in 1970 in Kautokeino, Finnmark County, Sara Margrethe Oskal studied drama at the Helsinki Theatre Academy before gaining a doctorate in performance art at the Oslo National Academy of the Arts in 2009. Her doctoral thesis dealt with the humour in traditional Sami stories and the art of Sami chanting.

In 2012, she published her second poetry collection Savkkuhan s√°vrri s√°niid, translated into Norwegian as Utrettelige ord (Tireless Words) in 2016. Evoking the often difficult encounters between Sami people and the sense of shame they often experience, the collection earned her the Nordic Council Literature prize for works in the Sami language. Her short poems are rich in alliteration, metaphor and striking pictorial language. They have been published in French and Breton in Vaimmu vuhttome / Kavell ma c'halon / Berceau de Mon c√¶ur (2014).

Comedian Joan Davis starred in the programs, all but one version of which were broadcast on CBS. The Sealtest Village Store (1943-1945) Singer Rudy Vall√©e's joining the U.S. Coast Guard during World War II left Sealtest Dairy with no star for The Rudy Vallee Show, which it sponsored. Therefore, the program was revamped and renamed The Sealtest Village Store. Davis was promoted from cast member to star in the new program, which debuted on July 8, 1943, on NBC. Her character was the proprietor of the title store, a woman who \\"chased men and pined for a steady beau.\\" Jack Haley joined the cast as the male lead in the role of Davis' helper in the story, apparently because NBC officials were dubious that a female star could be successful as the sole lead in a program. David C. Tucker, in his biography of Davis, described the program as \\"a ratings winner for NBC from 1943 through 1945.\\" The musical void left by Vall√©e's departure was filled by singer David Street. Davis emerged as a strong presence behind the scenes as well as on the air. Her disagreements with producer Tom McAvity over what was best for the show eventually led to McAvity's leaving the program, to be replaced by Robert Redd. As the end of Davis' contract with the sponsor approached, her agents contacted other potential sponsors, which did not sit well with officials at Sealtest. As a result, they went against a radio custom and did not allow her to say goodbye to listeners of her final Village Store program on June 28, 1945. Davis rebutted the sponsor's charge of disloyalty by reminding the company executives via a \\"scorching reply\\" that a year earlier she had stayed with Sealtest rather than accept a significantly higher salary from the American Tobacco Company. The program's supporting cast included Sharon Douglas, Shirley Mitchell, and Verna Felton. The Fountainaires Quartet and Eddie Paul and his orchestra provided music. Robert L. Redd was the director, with Ray Singer and Dick Chevillat as writers. The Joan Davis Show or Joanie's Tea Room (1945-1947)  Swan Soap advertisement for Joan Davis' radio program. After leaving The Sealtest Village Store, Davis began her new program on September 3, 1945, on CBS. Sponsored by Swan Soap, the show replaced The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show. The premise had Davis as proprietor of Joanie's Tea Room, which resulted in use of that expression as an alternate title. Its final broadcast was on June 23, 1947. Like her character on the previous show, in this program Davis sought romance, especially with the program's singer, Andy Russell. That pursuit brought her in conflict with Barbara Weatherby, daughter of the town's banker. Meanwhile, Davis spurned the attentions of announcer Harry von Zell. A noticeable change from the Sealtest show was that this program had few guest stars, relying primarily on situation comedy. Others heard on the program, in addition to Davis, Russell, and von Zell, were Verna Felton as Rosella Hipperton III and Cousin Corneila, Shirley Mitchell and Sharon Douglas as Barbara Weatherby, Si Wills as Serenus, Wally Brown as himself, and Ben Gage as Dr. Ronald Crenshaw. Bob LeMond was an announcer. Paul Weston and Jack Meakin and their orchestras provided music in the first and second seasons, respectively. Dave Titus and Dick Mack produced and directed. Writers included Harry Crane, Larry Gelbart, Jack Harvey, Nat Linden, Herbert Little, Bob O'Brien, Joe Quillan, Jay Sommers, Si Wills, and David Victor.  Joan Davis Time (1947-1948)  Andy Russell and Joan Davis. After Swan Soap ended its contract with Davis midway through the original four-year span, Joan Davis Time debuted on October 11, 1947, as a revised version of Joanie's Tea Room, with Davis still owner of the tea shop. The program focused on \\"Joan's efforts to improve her life and find a steady boyfriend\\"‚Äîa premise that was reinforced by the show's theme song, \\"Nobody's Sweetheart\\". Humorous incidents arose from Davis' interactions with the tea shop's regular customers as well as with other people she met. Other than Davis, the main characters were her friend Mabel, played by Sharon Douglas, and tea shop manager Lionel, played by Lionel Stander. Other regulars were Hans Conried, Verna Felton, and Andy Russell. The Choraleers provided vocal music, while Lud Gluskin, John Rarig, and Paul Weston led their orchestras. Announcers were Ben Gage, Bob LeMond, and Harry von Zell. The producer was Dick Mack. The program ended on July 3, 1948.  Leave It to Joan (1949)  Joan Davis and Joseph Kearns from the radio program Leave it to Joan. Leave It to Joan debuted on CBS on July 4, 1949, as a summer replacement for the first half hour of Lux Radio Theatre and ran until August 22, 1949. Davis portrayed a sales clerk in a department store who lived with her father. Most of the plots evolved from her interactions with the store's staff, and each episode featured a guest star. Shirley Mitchell played Penny Prentiss, Andy Russell played Tom Hinkle, Harry von Zell played Simon Hackaday, and Joseph Kearns played Davis' father. Ken Niles was the announcer, and Lyn Murray led the orchestra. The sponsor was Roytan cigars. Leave It to Joan was the basis for an unsuccessful television pilot, Let's Join Joanie, which was broadcast on January 12, 1951, on CBS. The TV version had Davis in the role of a sales clerk in a hat store.

Nevertheless, in 1748 she held a ball which was attended by the King George II, which was described by Henry Fielding as \\"a most noble entertainment\\". It was also said that she \\"understood thoroughly the value of court smiles\\", and in 1762 she attended the French court at Versailles in an ambassadorial role. She was interested in art; her portrait was painted by Sir Joshua Reynolds in 1756 and is held in the collection at the family seat of Woburn Abbey. She was also painted by Thomas Hudson.

Early years Rose was born in southeastern New York state, in 1813. He had at least one sibling, a brother, Abram. Career After aiding in the pioneer development of Michigan, he left those forests in 1851, traveled the Applegate Trail, and arrived at the junction of Oregon's South Umpqua River and Deer Creek on September 23, 1851. His family and belongings were conveyed along with him in the prairie vehicle of the time, moved by oxen. Here, he settled on a donation claim of from the government, the site which Roseburg now occupies. He built him a clapboard shanty of sufficiently ample dimensions, near the place where the center of the city now is, and engaged in selling to travelers, teamsters and packers, who were very numerous in those days, such things as they needed. He also engaged in the business of farming and stock raising. Uncle Aaron, as he was familiarly called, seems to have thrived and prospered well in his mercantile and other pursuits, notwithstanding the fact that he sometimes saved money by taking his customers' notes for less than half the amount they owed him. In the early days, Rose stated, that money was more plentiful than provisions. Eggs and apples sold readily at apiece, and flour at a pound. Gold dust was the principal form of exchange. Rose held out the most liberal inducements for people to locate in Roseburg and join him in building up a flourishing city. Every manufacturing enterprise, and many of the leading mercantile houses in Roseburg at the end of the 19th-century, were given free sites and free lots. When the Southern Pacific Railroad was being built through Oregon, Rose gave the company a land subsidy valued at to run through Roseburg, which is now the end of one of the divisions of the road. To the Roseburg & Coos Bay Railroad, Rose gave five acres of land for depot facilities. All eight churches in Roseburg in his day, were given a lot free and money in addition to aid in the construction of the buildings. Rose, besides being Roseburg's leading benefactor, also did much for charity. Prior to 1860, Rose gave most of his time to farming, before the building up of Roseburg, having become interested in the various city enterprises, both as a shareholder and in encouraging such institutions as city water works, electric lights, and so forth, by giving liberal bonuses. Rose owned the New Era flour mills which had a daily capacity of 75 barrels, and a warehouse capacity of 25,000 bushels. Personal life Rose married three or four times, and had several children. With his first wife, Minerva, he had three daughters, including, Lucy A. Mallory. With his third wife, Frances, he had five children. He died in 1899.

It is also known as Mandalay and York House. The property is privately owned. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Fernleigh is believed by Sutherland historians to have been completed in 1821 for Thomas Laycock Jr., who, while himself mostly resident at his property Kelvin at Bringelly, built the house for his second wife, Margaret Connell, and the six children of his first marriage to Isabella Bunker of Collingwood, Liverpool. The home is believed to be the first constructed in the Sutherland area and has been an envied point of interest for one hundred years. However, in 2012 it was claimed that the Thomas Connell Laycock, espoused by Bruce Watt in Magnificent Fernleigh, was a typographical error and the correct name is in fact John Connell Laycock.Envirospace, 2012, 13 The first Crown Land sales took place in the Caringbah-Miranda area (then unnamed) in 1856-88. During this period (in 1858) John Connell Laycock bought this (parcel number 58) block of land, Lot 13, , for A¬£45. He also bought other large tracts of land in the Caringbah/Burraneer Bay areas, as did his uncle John Connell Junior. John Connell Laycock was a Member of the NSW Legislative Assembly, serving on no less than fifteen committees over a period of seven years. He also owned land in Yamba and was a quarantine keeper at in 1878. It was through him that Thomas Holt was first acquainted with Sutherland Shire. Laycock and his son escorted Holt around his Shire properties and Holt liked what he saw. Laycock was grandson of John Connell, an original settler at Kurnell. The name Kurnell is acknowledged as a corruption of the Connell family name.Envirospace, 2012 In 1860 Laycock sold it to Holt who began acquiring as much land in the Shire as he could. Eventually Holt controlled most of it (), including the majority of Laycock's estate and the land where Fernleigh is located. The date on which a large portion of his Sutherland Estate was acquired was 31 December 1862. Holt was a life member of the NSW Legislative Council and served on over twenty committees. He was also a successful wool buyer, investing in property, and farmed near Liverpool. He was a director of gold mining, insurance and railway companies. Throughout his life he acquired pastoral interests with others totalling in NSW and Queensland from 1851-80. Retired from business as a wool buyer in 1854 he retained pastoral interest and most directorships. He was Colonial Treasurer for a brief time. He sold some of his runs after the gold rush and in 1861 bought an estate extending from Botany Bay to Port Hacking including James Cook's landing place, where he erected an obelisk in the centenary year. He also tried raising sheep on pastures sown with imported grass and then cattle, scientific oyster-farming, timber-getting and coal- mining, each without success. He campaigned for the damming of the George's River to supply Sydney with water but the NSW Government rejected his scheme. A report Holt commissioned his property manager, R. C. Walker to prepare in 1868 on the extent and viability of his large estate summarised the Burraneer Bay property thus: \\"40 acres on east side of Dolan's Bay, in Burrameer Bay. This is a block of very thickly timbered land, with a great deal of scrub on it. Nothing has yet been done to it either in ringbarking or scrubbing. The soil is ironstone clay and sandy soil but very rocky. There is a fine view of the Port Hacking River from it and it would make a very good building site\\". Holt sold it in 1873 to Charles York. The locality sketch attached to the certificate of title does not indicate any improvements on the site. York bought the land for a \\"country retreat\\", taking perhaps one or two years to complete a stone cottage. He originally named it \\"York House\\" and it was in the Georgian Revival style. Charles York died in 1880. His widow Emma transferred title in 1883 to Thomas James York of Pyrmont Bridge. The Gannon family acquired the property in 1888. It is believed they altered the building and renamed it Fernleigh (in 1889). William Gannon owned the Union Hotel in Tempe and his wife was proprietor of Petty's Hotel nearby. His father Michael Gannon and his sons William and Joseph were very supportive of all sporting activities held in the area. Gannon's Forest now known as Hurstville, was named after this family. They owned it until early 1905 when the estate was again subdivided and sold. The remaining portion of the land containing the Fernleigh residence was still some 8 acres in area with an orchard north of the house and several large paddocks to the south and west. Members of the Gannon family have resided here for a period of time. Fernleigh was shown in a 1/1905 estate vendor plan (the first to show improvements on the property) with balconies wrapping around two sides and a substantial rear extension, now the formal living room, bathroom and pantry, but not the sunroom. An outbuilding to its west, being the kitchen and servants' quarters, which have now been incorporated into the house, an orchard to its north (on what is now 38-42b Fernleigh Road), a boat shed further north, in front of what is now 2 Coonabarabran Place, three small boatsheds further north, in front of what is now 1 and 3 Coonabarabran Place, stables on what is now the eastern side of 60 and 62 Fernleigh Road, various sheds along what is now the southern part of 62 and 64a Fernleigh Road, and further south what appear to be animal pens on what is now the eastern part of 68 and 70 Fernleigh Road. The house had significant alterations in this period. The verandah was extended down the southern and northern sides using corrugated asbestos sheeting. Horse stalls at the southern side rear were removed and servants' quarters which originally were in a separate building were roofed over and joined to the main building, creating a large living room. Dormer windows were added to the house's front to create two small attic bedrooms. In March 1905 Mrs Gannon sold lots 8, 9 & 10 to James Taylor Austin. There were no improvements on this part of the land. He is recorded as living at Port Hacking in July 1920. This may relate to the Burraneer Bay address. Mrs Gannon (who was living in the two hotels in Tempe), died on 5 September 1906. Much of the property's contents were sold off. In December 1908 her remaining lands were transferred to Robert Owen Gribben, her nephew. He sold various lots until his death in 1910. Part Lot 1 (the subject site) was sold to Charles John Miller on 15 April 1910; part to Otto Fredrick Wunderlich on the same date. Wunderlich was a well-known Sydney socialite and managing director of Wunderlich Ltd. Part Lot 1 was also sold to Edwin Crescence Cook on the same date. He was a Lieutenant in the NSW Defence Force in 1897. Part Lot 1 was sold again to George Cornish Dwyer of Glebe on 17 April 1911. By 1914 Edwin Crescence Cook held the parcel of land that is the subject site (Burraneer Bay marina) and Fernleigh. On 11 September 1914 it was sold to Rose Annie Isabella Rofe, wife oa John Rofe, Sydney solicitor. The Rofes did not reside at Fernleigh, or not full-time. Until she died in 1931, their residential address was in Stanmore. Mr Rofe died three weeks later. In 1932 the property passed to two of their sons, Alfred and Edgar, both solicitors. In 1935 it was sold to Harry Peel, merchant. He took over an importing business of his father's, living in Coogee at that time - the family were keen sailors. Since the early 1930s there has been a regular motor boat race from Rose Bay (and later, Broken Bay) to Port Hacking for which the \\"Harry Peel Trophy\\" was awarded. Peel and his wife were both members of the Port Hacking branch of the Royal Motor Yacht Club, where they actively raced their speed boat, Baltimore. He resided in Helensburgh. Peel may have been related to the Gannon family by marriage. Fernleigh Road was extended further south to loop around and join up with Gannons Road. The subdivision pattern was greatly fragmented undergoing major changes from the 1905 subdivision. During this period Fernleigh underwent several changes with a ballroom being added in 1920 and an Art Deco style bathroom in the 1930s. Mr and Mrs Errol Alcott bought the property from Peel in 1947; and it has been in the Alcott family since then. The property has water access. Part of Fernleigh is known to have operated as a commercial marina and slipway since the early 1940s. At that time the site was known as \\"The Three Pines Boatshed\\". There is anecdotal evidence of the slipping of vessels from 1949. The first tender owned by the boatshed was built in 1945 and is still in use by the marina today. It is believed that during the 1950s and 1960s the NSW Police regularly called upon the vessel to assist with search and rescue activities on the Port Hacking River. The Three Pines Boatshed part of the original holding, now called Burraneer Bay Marina, was subdivided off in the 1970s. In 1976 the first marina jetty and mooring pens were constructed. The first vessel to lease one of the moorings is still there today. A number of marina support facilities are provided, such as vessel maintenance, slipway facilities, fuel and sewer pump-out. The marine presently contains 72 over-water commercial berths, 31 swing moorings distributed throughout Burraneer Bay and slipway capacity on two slipways for up to three vessels at any time. The marina is presently home for two NSW Maritime vessels that regularly patrol the Port Hacking River. Apparently the launch of \\"Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport\\", the quintessential Australian folk song of Alcott family friend Rolf Harris, was held on Fernleigh's front lawn. The present Fernleigh Road was named after the house. A proposed additional 35 new berths and refurbishment of the marina was proposed in 2012.  Description  The layout of the main part of the house follows a typical square Old Colonial Georgian format. There are four rooms divided down the middle by a wide hallway. Originally the two rooms on the southern side were bedrooms and the two on the northern side were dining and sitting rooms. Walls are constructed from hand-hewn sandstone blocks. The slate roof is original. Chimney pots also are Victorian. The house's details suggest several stages of alteration / extension and repair. It has seven bedrooms. The stone was cut on the property, and signs of the quarrying may still be seen at the back of the house. A stone lintel over the front door says 1821. The timber used was cedar, obtained from a small stand on a nearby ridge. The dormer windows do not appear in an early photograph of the home, while the line of the original veranda which extended across the eastern facade only may be seen under the current veranda. The courtyard between the home and its formerly separate kitchen block has been enclosed to create a large sitting room. Beneath each of the main rooms is a cellar with a trap door. This construction created coolness in summer as well as providing cool- storage near the kitchen area. The kitchen wing was originally separated from the living area by a flag-stoned courtyard, but many years ago this was enclosed by a previous owner, and the flagged stone flooring of both kitchen and courtyard were wood-floored. The property has water access. A ballroom was added in 1920 and an art deco bathroom in the 1930s. The Three Pines Boatshed, part of the original holding and now called Burraneer Bay Marina, was subdivided off in the 1970s. = Modifications and dates = or prior, significant alterations to the house - verandah extended down southern and northern sides with corrugated asbestos sheeting. Horse stalls on southern side rear were removed and the servants' quarters which originally were in a separate building were roofed over and joined to the main building, creating a large living room.

It is located in Downtown Halifax at the corner of Spring Garden Road and Grafton Street under a parking lot beside the St. Mary's Basilica and owned by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Halifax- Yarmouth. History The cemetery was created following passage of the 1783 Nova Scotia Catholic Relief Act which legalized land titles held by Roman Catholics and repealed penalties against Roman Catholic priests. The law allowed Halifax Catholics to build St. Peter's chapel in downtown Halifax and establish a cemetery on consecrated ground beside the church. Records for the first two decades of the cemetery have been lost, but burial records from 1801 onwards detail the interments of 2,578 men, women and children until the cemetery was closed in 1843. A conservative estimate of deaths for the first 20 years of the cemetery brings the total to 3,000 graves. Gordon Douglas Pollock and Sharon Riel, ‚ÄúSt. Peter's/St. Mary's Burial Registers‚Äù, Genealogical Association of Nova Scotia The St. Peter's church and cemetery was renamed St. Mary's cemetery in 1833.

Almer√≠a, a Mediterranean port in the southeast of the emirate, was the initial Aragonese target in a joint Aragonese-Castilian campaign aimed at conquering Granada. The Aragonese troops led by their King James II arrived on 11 August, blockading the city and employing siege engines. The city, led by governor Abu Maydan Shuayb and naval commander Abu al-Hasan al-Randahi, prepared for the siege by strengthening its defenses and stockpiling food. Throughout the siege, both sides exchanged shots from siege engines and engaged in fields battles and skirmishes with varying results. James ordered multiple unsuccessful assaults. A Granadan relief column under Uthman ibn Abi al-Ula arrived nearby in September and harassed the besiegers. The approach of winter and a shortage of supplies in the besiegers' camp led James II to agree to a truce at the end of December. The siege was lifted and the Aragonese began withdrawing from Granadan territories. As James II did not have sufficient ships to transport his troops at once, some men were left behind. Some of them pillaged Granadan territories and some were ambushed while trying to travel home without authorization, resulting in their temporary capture. The siege was viewed as a decisive victory for Granada and ended Aragonese military involvement in the emirate for the rest of James II's reign. Sultan Nasr of Granada made peace with Aragon and Castile in 1310.  Background  upright=1.5 Since the mid- thirteenth century, the Emirate of Granada was the last remaining Muslim state on the Iberian peninsula. Through a combination of diplomatic and military manoeuvres, it succeeded in maintaining its independence despite being surrounded by two larger neighbours, the Crown of Castile to the north and the Muslim Marinid state based in Morocco. From its founding in the 1230s, Granada intermittently entered into alliance or went to war with either of these powers, or encouraged them to fight one another in order to avoid being dominated by either. At the death of Muhammad II () and the accession of Muhammad III (), Granada was allied with a nearby Christian kingdom, Aragon, and at war with Castile. Muhammad III eventually made peace with Castile in the 1303 treaty of C√≥rdoba and became a vassal of Ferdinand IV of Castile (). Aragon made peace with Castile in the 1304 Treaty of Torellas, which also included peace with Granada as Castile's vassal. Having secured peace with the two largest powers on the Iberian Peninsula, the Emirate of Granada turned its attention to North Africa. Taking advantage of the war between the Marinids and the Kingdom of Tlemcen, Muhammad III instigated a rebellion in Ceuta‚Äîa port town just across the Strait of Gibraltar‚Äîagainst the Marinids in 1304, and in 1306 he sent a fleet to capture the town from the rebels. With Ceuta in its possession, Granada controlled both sides of the strait‚Äîit held the ports of Gibraltar and Algeciras on the European side of the strait, as well as M√°laga and Almer√≠a further east. This development alienated Aragon, Castile, and the Marinids, who all began to make plans against Granada. Castile and Aragon signed the Treaty of Alcal√° de Henares on 19 December 1308, pledging to help each other to achieve a total conquest of Granada and split its territories between them. Aragon was promised a sixth of Granadan territories, including the port town of Almer√≠a, and the rest would go to Castile. In addition, both Christian powers also made an alliance with Abu al-Rabi Sulayman, who became the Sultan of the Marinids in July 1308 and wanted to recover Ceuta. The end result was a tripartite alliance of Castile, Aragon and the Marinids against Granada, which was now isolated and surrounded by three larger enemies. As preparation for war was underway, the people and notables of Granada, angered by the diplomatic isolation, stormed the palaces of Muhammad III and his vizier Ibn al-Hakim al-Rundi, and dethroned the sultan in favour of his younger half-brother Nasr on 14 March 1309.  Preparation  James II of Aragon (right) in a miniature of the early 14th century Aragon's naval preparation was noticed by Granada and at the end of February 1309, and Muhammad III queried James II of Aragon () about the target of the operation. James II responded on 17 March, assuring Granada that it was for his conquest of Sardinia. As tensions rose and Castile's vassals began attacking Granada's borders, the governor of Almer√≠a, Abu Maydan Shuayb, arrested Catalan merchants based in his city and confiscating their goods, while the Granadan fleet prepared for war. James II and his ally Ferdinand IV asked Pope Clement V‚Äîwithout mentioning their collaboration with the Marinids‚Äîto grant a crusading bull and financial support from the church. The pope granted James II two thirds of the decima‚Äîa tenth of church revenues, which can be collected by the monarch if authorized by the pope‚Äîfor the upcoming crusade against Granada, and declared indulgences for those participating in the war. To wage war against Granada, James II raised an army with the planned total of 12,000 including 1,000 knights and 2,000 archers. He also raised funds and strengthened the defenses of the Kingdom of Valencia, his realm closest to Granada. His target was Almer√≠a, in the southeastern coast of the Emirate of Granada and about from the capital. James brought along a relic of Indaletius, a saint from the ancient Urci on whose ruins Almer√≠a was believed to stand. Aragon did not have an immediate border with the Emirate, so a part of the force was transported by sea and others had to march overland through Castilian territories and then from the Castile‚ÄìGranada frontiers to Almer√≠a via hostile territories. The city of Almer√≠a prepared against a siege by stockpiling food, implementing a ration and strengthening the city's defenses. A Muslim account emphasized the importance of the food supplies, saying that \\"one of the signs of Allah's protection of the city's inhabitants was that great quantities of barley were in the storehouses at the beginning of the siege\\". The city's governor, Abu Maydan Shuayb and the naval commander Abu al- Hasan al-Randahi organized the improvement of the city's defense. They strengthened the walls, closed various gaps and demolished outer buildings that might be used by the attackers.  Siege  The Emirate of Granada, including Almer√≠a in the southeastern coast James II and his forces sailed from Valencia on 18 July 1309 and landed on the coast of Almer√≠a on 11 August. A Muslim account emphasized the forces' rich and colorful clothing, and the military instruments played by their musicians. His forces included siege engines such as mangonels and trebuchets. Such a display initially demoralized the defenders, but as time went by and various incidents took place, they became more optimistic. The besiegers spread its troops to blockade the city by land and sea, and established palisades and ditches. The defenders manned the walls with archers and infantrymen, and barred all the gates with stonework except for some which were to be used for sorties. The late summer arrival was a major disadvantage for the invaders. It meant that there was a short time before the weather got cooler, and if the siege lasted until winter it would be an advantage for the defenders who did not have to be out in the field. Apart from Almer√≠a in the east, the Emirate of Granada had to defend itself from multiple fronts. In North Africa, the Marinids attacked Ceuta in 12 May 1308 and took it on 21 July, while in Granada's western flank, Castile besieged Algeciras (31 July 1309 ‚Äì January 1310), as well as Gibraltar (August ‚Äì September 1309). Nevertheless, Nasr sent a relief forces to Almer√≠a, which was defeated by the Aragonese in an open battle on 23 August. A Christian account mentioned that the Muslims lost 6,000 men, but modern historian Joseph F. O'Callaghan considered this figure to be exaggerated. Upon hearing the news, Pope Clement V congratulated James on the victory. The defeated relief forces remained in the vicinity, and continued to harass the besiegers. In late August or early September, the city defenders repelled an assault by the Aragonese forces. The attackers used scaling ladders and siege towers which were loaded with troops and moved by wheels. The defenders resisted by pouring boiling oil and other flammables on the assailants. As a result, one of the siege towers was burnt and the assault was aborted. During the retreat, many assailants were left behind and captured by the Muslims. After this failure, the Aragonese continued to lob rocks weighing up to thirty pounds into the city. The attackers also employed sappers to dig tunnels with the goal of undermining the foundation of the walls, but the defenders employed counter- sappers who found the tunnels. An underground combat ensued which resulted in the destruction of the attackers' tunnels. In mid or late September, Granada made peace with the Marinids, in exchange for surrendering the western towns of Algeciras (besieged by Castile) and Ronda. Not only did this mean that there was one less enemy for Granada, but the Marinids also took over the responsibilities for defending Algeciras, freeing Nasr to strengthen his eastern flank. On 17 September a Volunteers of the Faith contingent sent from Granada under Uthman ibn Abi al-Ula arrived in Marchena near Almer√≠a and defeated a small Aragonese force. This relief contingent camped nearby and continuously frustrated the besiegers by harassing their foraging parties. On 15 October, the Aragonese reported a victory against a Muslim army of 60,000, killing 2,000 and taking others prisoners, numbers considered \\"surely [..] an exaggeration\\" by O'Callaghan. James sent warnings of Muslim counter-attacks to his cities of Murcia and Lorca. As the siege continued, the invaders tried to use a stratagem to trick the defenders. A group of Christian soldiers slipped out in the darkness and then approached the city dressed in burnouses to make the defenders think that they were Muslims. Another group of Christian knights then pretended to give them a chase and to leave their tents unguarded. The tents were made to look as a tempting target for pillage while in fact they were set up for an ambush. A group of riders then came out of the city to pillage the tents, but the Christians came out of their concealed positions too soon, allowing the riders to escape. Most of them managed to reenter the city via the side entrance that happened to be made ready to open the day before, but some were left behind. They then had to stay at the foot of the walls, protected by covering fire from the city. When the fighting died down they reentered the city. The siege's progress was dominated by the exchange of shots from siege engines. According to Ibn Al-Qadi 22,000 rocks were thrown throughout the siege. The attackers had eleven catapults or other such engines. The Muslims initially had just one, but when this was destroyed by enemy fire they built three more. At the end of December, a section of the walls was breached and the Christians rushed to attack it, but a Muslim force defended the section and stopped them from entering the city.  Truce and Aragonese withdrawal  At the end of the year, the prospect for an Aragonese victory faded. Winter was coming and would endanger their forces in the field. The concurrent siege of Algeciras by Castile was weakening, which allowed Granada to deploy more forces against Aragon. In addition, winds blew from the west and prevented the besiegers from receiving supplies which came by sea from Aragon. The Granadan commander, Uthman ibn Abi al-Ula not only successfully harassed the attackers, but served as a diplomat in negotiations with James II. At the end of December, a parley took place in the Aragonese camp and both sides agreed to a truce. Under the terms of the truce, the Aragonese were to lift the siege and withdraw from Granadan territories. Due to logistical difficulties, such as a lack of vessels to bring the troops home, evacuation took place gradually and some men were left behind under Muslim protection. Some of the demoralized Aragonese tried to go home without authorization and suffered ambushes and attacks along the way, with many captured by the Muslims. At one point during the evacuation, Nasr wrote to James that the city's defenders had to put the remaining Aragonese troops under detention because they were pillaging Granadan territories. Nasr further noted that the Muslims gave them housing and food at their own expense \\"because some of them were starving\\" while waiting for the Aragonese ships to pick them up. A rumour of a renewed attack by James II circulated in the city but never materialized. The citizens of Almer√≠a removed leftover siege works outside the city walls as precautions. The Aragonese prisoners were later released in the peace settlement.  Aftermath  The defeat of the Aragonese in Almer√≠a, as well as the simultaneous defense of Algeciras from Castile, were major successes for Granada. Both Castile and Aragon made peace with Granada by early 1310. According to the historian L. P. Harvey, the particularly humiliating defeat and evacuation of the Aragonese \\"taught [the Aragonese] a lesson\\" and delayed the progress of the reconquista for decades. Jos√© Ram√≥n Hinojosa Montalvo wrote that \\"the material and morale failure of the Granada enterprise\\" caused James II to subsequently redirect his attention to the central Mediterranean, away from Granada. For Granada, the successes in Almer√≠a and Algeciras were tempered by the loss of Gibraltar to Castile, as well as the cession of Algeciras and Ronda to the Marinids. Nasr himself became unpopular and faced the rebellion of his brother-in-law Abu Said Faraj and nephew Ismail in 1311, which resulted in his dethronement and the accession of Ismail in 1314.

Its name is linked with the historical region of Terra d'Otranto which included almost all the municipalities of the current provinces of Taranto, Brindisi and Lecce. It is recognised as PDO product.  Origins  The cultivation of the olive tree in Terra d'Otranto has been introduced by the Greeks and by Phoenicians. Nevertheless, after the cessation of this activity during the Middle Ages, the Basilian monks started the first booming market of olive oil of this territory.  Geography  The extra-virgin olive oil Terra d'Otranto is produced in the area between the Ionian and the Adriatic Sea, between the Murge in the province of Taranto and the Serre next to Lecce. This territory includes all the cities and villages of the province of Lecce, in the eastern part of the province of Taranto and in the municipalities of Brindisi, Cellino San Marco, Erchie, Francavilla Fontana, Latiano, Mesagne, Oria, San Donaci, San Pancrazio Salentino, San Pietro Vernotico, Torchiarolo and Torre Santa Susanna in the northern part of Salento.

Life Bohman grew up in Kolm√•rden, a town about 150 km south of Stockholm that is famous for its zoo, the Kolm√•rden Wildlife Park. She has written that she visited the Kolm√•rden zoo frequently as a child. Bohman is an editor for a monthly magazine called Axess, and is also an art critic for the Swedish newspaper Expressen. In addition to her work for those publications, Bohman is a freelance writer about art, literature and fashion. In 2010, Bohman‚Äôs debut novel, Drowned, was published in Sweden and it was subsequently translated and published in France, Germany, Holland, Australia, New Zealand and the United States. Drowned was recommended by Oprah's Book Club. Interests and Influences Bohman has stated that her favorite author is Michel Houellebecq. Bohman said that Hoellebecq‚Äôs male protagonists ‚Äúare cynical, bitter, even misogynic, but I feel a kind of tenderness for them, and I also feel that I understand them.‚Äù Bohman has also said she is a ‚Äúbig fan‚Äù of Karl Ove Knausgaard. As an art critic, Bohman has said that her artistic interests are similar to those of Kristina, the protagonist of her novel Eventide, in that she prefers nineteenth century, decadent and fin de si√®cle art, and is especially interested in how women are depicted in such works: > It is such a fascinating period of history with big changes in society and > culture: Darwin‚Äôs theories on evolution changed the way people thought about > themselves and about God, secularization, urbanization, the women‚Äôs and > labour movements, a little later Freud and his theories about the > unconscious. All these things made traces in the art from the period, and > they are evident in the way women were depicted. Critical Reception Tara Cheesman-Olmsted reviewed Bohman‚Äôs first two novels, Drowned and The Other Woman, in The Quarterly Conversation. Cheesman- Olmsted found remarkable similarities between the two works: \\"The books share so much in common that they might be the same novel: both explore almost identical situations, share many of the same structural and plot devices, and the author‚Äôs and translator Marlaine Delargy‚Äôs prose styles remain the same from book to book.\\" The key similarity of Drowned and The Other Woman, Cheesman-Olmsted writes, is that they feature protagonists entangled with older men. Bohman, she writes, ‚Äúchannels the psyches of twenty-something University students engaged in liaisons with men already involved with other women‚Ä¶. Bohman‚Äôs treatment of them is inarguably sympathetic. Their affairs with men may be the impetus for coming-of-age journeys, but they do not represent a final destination.‚Äù Cheesman-Olmsted is laudatory of both novels, writing, ‚ÄúTherese Bohman strikes the right balance between lavish prose and simple storytelling‚Äîallowing her books to be both beautiful literary objects and vehicles which engage readers through larger ideas.‚Äù Writing in the Los Angeles Review of Books, Randy Rosenthal praised Eventide as ‚Äúfull of damn fine writing, but it‚Äôs the novel‚Äôs irreverent attitude toward feminism that makes it as challenging as it is necessary to read.‚Äù Rosenthal noted that the main character, Karolina, was ‚Äúwell drawn,‚Äù but questioned whether the novel could be sustained by the scant plot. Rosenthal concluded that ‚ÄúKarolina lives by her own terms, and that alone is a courageous kind of success.‚Äù Publisher‚Äôs Weekly described Eventide as ‚Äúmoving,‚Äù going on to say that ‚Äú[t]his psychologically rich journey provides insight into an intelligent, successful woman who burns with needs she fears she can‚Äôt fulfill.‚Äù Kirkus Reviews called Bohman ‚Äúan adroit novelist,‚Äù and concluded in its review of Eventide by saying that the book is ‚Äú[i]ntelligent, impassioned, and compelling ... Bohman's latest explores complex inner worlds with great sensitivity and insight.‚Äù Works =Novels= * Den drunknade (2010, trans. as Drowned by Marlaine Delargy, 2012) * Den andra kvinnan (2014, trans. as The Other Woman by Marlaine Delargy, 2016) * Aftonland (2016, trans. as Eventide by Marlaine Delargy, 2018) See also * Swedish literature * Michel Houellebecq * Karl Ove Knausgaard * Axess magasin * Expressen References Sources   External links * Therese Bohman's Twitter (@theresebohman) * Therese Bohman's Pinterest Category:Swedish novelists Category:Swedish writers Category:Swedish journalists Category:Decadent literature Category:1978 births Category:Living people ","title":"Therese Bohman"},{"id":"58069869","text":"Stefan Matzner (born 24 April 1993) is an Austrian track cyclist.

On 17 Jun 1619, at the age of only 21, he was appointed Bishop of Imola by Pope Paul V, for which he required a special dispensation because he was below the canonical age for ordination and consecration. This dispensation was issued on 26 June 1619.Gauchat, p. 209 note 4. On 15 Sep 1619, he was consecrated a bishop by Giambattista Leni, Bishop of Ferrara, with Ulpiano Volpi, Archbishop Emeritus of Chieti, and Francesco Sacrati, Titular Archbishop of Damascus, serving as co-consecrators. Shortly after taking possession of the diocese of Imola, Bishop Millini conducted a general visitation of the diocese, and then, on 12 and 13 April 1622, held a diocesan synod and had its Constitutions published.Synodus diocesana Imolensis in Italia, sub Illistriss. et reverendiss. d. d.

Early Life Julia Canny was born to a poor farming family in Clonbur, Co. Galway in 1894. She only had a fifth-grade education. Canny emigrated to the US in 1921, joining the Society of the Helpers of the Holy Souls in New York in 1933. She embarked for Japan in 1939 from San Francisco. After Pearl Harbor, she was interned on the presumption of being an American, but released after six months when it was demonstrated by the Swiss ambassador that she was an Irish citizen. Hiroshima On 6 August 1945, Canny had been sitting outside the Sisters of the Holy Souls convent when the atomic bomb was dropped. She and the other sisters took shelter in the convent, but had to run back out moments later when it collapsed. They later took shelter in a Jesuit chapel four kilometres away and helped 90 other survivors who had gathered there. Other than Aidan MacCarthy, Canny was one of the few Irish citizens to witness the detonation of the world‚Äôs first atomic bomb to be used in warfare. Later life Canny never returned to Ireland, and was bed-ridden for the last years of her life. She died on 1 November 1987 in Tokyo.

Tbilisi 2014 The eastern areas Bjni, Gegharkunik, Vayots-dzor, Artsakh, Siunik, Nakhichevan, Dvin and Yerevan were under the jurisdiction of the atabeg Ivane Mkhargrdzeli and his son Avag. First Dvin and later Bjni were centres of this division. The subjects of Ivane‚Äôs family were the Orbelians, Khaghbakian, Dopians, Hasan-Jalalyan and others.  Biography  During Mongol invasion of Georgia Queen Rusudan had to evacuate Tbilisi for Kutaisi, leaving eastern Georgia in the hands of atabeg Avag Mkhargrdzeli and Kakhetian lord, Egarslan Bakurtsikheli, who made peace with the Mongols and agreed to pay them tribute. Avag Mkhargrdzeli, who was raised by Queen Rusudan from the rank of spasalar to amirspasalar (Lord High Constable), and then to that of atabeg (tutor) arranged the submission of Queen Rusudan to the Mongols in 1243, and Georgia officially acknowledged the Great Khan as its overlord. During this period of interregnum (1245‚Äì1250), with the two Davids absent at the court of the Great Khan in Karakorum, the Mongols divided the Kingdom of Georgia into eight districts (tumen), one of them commanded by Avag Mkhargrdzeli. Exploiting the complicated issue of succession on Georgian throne, the Mongols had the Georgian nobles divided into two rival parties, each of which advocated their own candidate to the crown, where Avag was supporting candidacy of David Narin. David VII of Georgia visited the estates of atabag Avag when he died, leaving no son behind, but only a daughter by the name of Khuashak. The King came to the funeral in Bjni and noticed the good-looking widow of Avag, Gvantsa. He fell in love with her and a little time later took her as his wife and Queen, and brought her to his kingdom. And he left Avag's daughter to govern her estate, entrusting her to the supervision of Sadun of Mankaberdi. Matosavank monastery was constructed with the oversight of Avag.

P. Lovecraft and Anna Helen Crofts. The two authors wrote the story in or shortly before the summer of 1920. It was published the following September in United Amateur, which credits Lovecraft as Henry Paget-Lowe. In the story, a young woman dreams that she has an audience with Zeus, who explains to her that the gods have been asleep and dreaming, but they have chosen a poet who will herald their awakening. The story was written after \\"The Green Meadow\\", and before \\"The Crawling Chaos\\"‚Äîtwo tales that Lovecraft and Winifred Jackson co-wrote with a Greek mythology basis. What Anna Helen Crofts contributed to \\"Poetry and the Gods\\" is unknown. Lovecraft scholar S. T. Joshi reports that she \\"appeared sporadically in the amateur press, and may have been introduced to [Lovecraft] by Winifred Jackson.\\" Lovecraft's surviving letters do not mention \\"Poetry and the Gods\\". In his 1955 essay on the Cthulhu Mythos, Lovecraft scholar George Wetzel compares the messenger god Hermes in \\"Poetry and the Gods\\" with Nyarlathotep, the \\"messenger of Azathoth\\". Wetzel considers the dream communication used by Hermes to be \\"the same psychic device used later by Cthulhu to contact his cult followers.\\" Plot The story begins in a drawing room on an April evening \\"just after the Great War\\". A young woman, Marcia, is there alone, feeling an \\"immeasurable gulf that [separates] her soul\\" from her uninspiring surroundings: 20th-century life and the \\"strange home\\" in which she lives. She wonders whether she was born in the wrong age. She leafs through a magazine to look for some soothing poetry, and lands on an atmospheric free verse poem. With its sensually rich images, the poem sends her into a reverie. Marcia believes it to herald a new age. She repeats its words to herself as she drifts off to sleep. Hermes appears before her sleeping body, and confirms that a new age is indeed coming: one in which the gods wake from their own dream-filled sleep, and take action. Hermes carries her to the court of Zeus, where Apollo, Dionysus, the Muses, and the Bacchae also wait. \\"Long have we‚Ä¶ spoken only through our dreams,\\" Zeus tells her, \\"but the time approaches when our voices shall not be silent. It is a time of awakening and change.\\" He says that the gods have chosen a poet \\"to blend into one glorious whole all the beauty that the world hath known before, and to write words wherein shall echo all the wisdom and the loveliness of the past.\\" This consummate poet is to be the harbinger of the gods' awakening. He was chosen not only by the gods themselves, but by select poets whom Zeus and Apollo granted immortality and honor. In turn, these six poets come forth and contribute lines of verse: Homer, Dante, Goethe, Shakespeare, Milton, and Keats. They continue until just before dawn, and Hermes carries Marcia back to her house. Years later, Marcia is with the poet foretold by Zeus. When she tells him that his poetry is \\"fit for the gods\\", Zeus sends her a vision and declares: \\"By his word shall thy steps be guided to happiness, and in his dreams of beauty shall thy spirit find all that it craveth.\\" See also * \\"Nyarlathotep\\" (1920) * The Bacchae References External links Category:Short stories by H.

It was one of the first rail-trails to be built in California. Route The trail begins at the Olympic Boulevard staging area in Lafayette and ends at the Val Vista staging area in Moraga. Most of the trail is parallel to St. Mary's Road. The trail can be accessed from the Lafayette BART station, which is less than a mile's journey from where the trail meets 3rd Street and Moraga Boulevard. The trail is one part of the Lamorinda Trail Loop. The trail makes a connection to the Briones to Las Trampas Regional Trail via 3rd Street in Lafayette. It passes through the Moraga Commons park in Moraga and near the Lafayette Community Park in Lafayette. It passes near several schools, Saint Mary's College and Joaquin Moraga Intermediate School in Moraga, and Lafayette Elementary School in Lafayette. The trail terminates in the Valle Vista staging area in Moraga, which is on EBMUD land. An $10 EBMUD trail use permit is required to hike in this area. The Valle Vista staging area connects to multiple EBMUD hiking trails, the 2.9 mile Redwood Trail (connecting to the East Ridge trail in Redwood Regional Park), and the 6.2 mile Rocky Ridge Trail. The trail is maintained by the East Bay Regional Park District. It is a wheelchair accessible paved trail. History The Lafayette-Moraga trail was built on a railway corridor which was once used to carry redwood lumber from Oakland to Sacramento. The corridor was first used by mule trains, and then by steam trains. The corridor then passed into a utility easement, before being converted into a paved multi-use recreational trail with the cooperation of local communities and utility districts. January 2016 closure A portion of the trail near the Valle Vista staging area has been closed since January 2016, due to a mudslide where Canyon Bridge crosses Moraga Creek. The closure is beyond downtown Moraga, and the main part of the trail between Lafayette and Moraga is still open. However, it is no longer possible to use the trail to reach the Valle Vista staging area in Moraga. The neighboring Canyon Road Bridge was closed on April 2017 but was reopened in November 2017, and it should be possible to reach the Valle Vista staging area via Canyon Road.

Christian Zartmann (1793-1853), a military officer, lived in the building in 1827. The navel officer C. D. von Hegerman- Lindencrone (1807-1893) was a resident in both 1830 and 1832. Alfred Hage Alfred Hage, who had become a partner in H. Puggaard & Co. a few years earlier, lived in the building from 1843 to 1848. Hage was involved with the National Liberal movement and wrote for the magazine F√¶drelandet.When the slesvig-holsten deputation came to Copenhagen in March 1848, Hage invited them to stay in his home in Kronprinsessegade. Studenterkorpset placed guards outside the building. The lawyer and politician C. C. W. Liebe (1820-1900) was a resident in 1850. Architecture Kronprinsessegade 20 seen Kronprinsessegade 20 is seven bays wide and has slightly progressing, one-bay corner risalits at each end. The wall between the two corner risalits has grew dressing on the high cellar while the upper three floors stand in red-painted, blank brick. The windows of the corner risalits on the bottom floor have framing and are topped by triangular pediments. The windows of the two corner risalits on the second floor are surrounded by rusticated framing while there are semi-curcilar Tympana over the five central windows. The roof is a slate- clad Mansard roof with seven dormers and five chimneys. An attica was removed in the middle of the 19th century. Under the roof runs a white-painted cornice supported by brackets. A rather clumpsy iron canopy over the gateway of the building doubles as a balcony on the first floor. The gateway opens to a narrow courtyard. A four-storey, six-bay side wing extends from the rear side of the building along the north side of the courtyard.
