L. salmonae is the causative agent of microsporidial gill disease of salmon. It is an intracellular parasite which induces respiratory distress, secondary infection, and increased mortality rates. Life Cycle Loma salmonae enters the Oncorhynchus host's gut via an infective spores. Once in the gut, the spore injects its sporoplasm into an epithelial cell. From there, it migrates to the heart for a two-week merogony- like phase. In the heart, the host's immune system phagocytizes the parasite. Following macrophage mediated transportation, L. salmonae enters into the host's gills where it enters a final developmental stage. At this stage, it becomes a spore laden xenoma. This xenoma ruptures and causes inflammation and severe gill damage. This also opens up the possibility of secondary infection. The released spores can then be consumed by another Oncorynchus spp. completing the life cycle.

Knott Humanities Center, commonly known as the Humanities Center, is the oldest building on the campus of Loyola University Maryland in Baltimore, Maryland. The Tudor Revival building was originally built as a private residence in 1896 by New York architecture firm Renwick, Aspinwall, and Russell. Alice Whitridge Garret, the widowed heiress to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad fortune, had the house built on the southern edge of the Garret Family‚Äôs Evergreen estate in Baltimore. It was to be a wedding present for her son Horatio and his bride Charlotte Garrett and serve as their ‚Äúcottage‚Äù home. The house was nicknamed ‚ÄúEvergreen junior‚Äù and cost $85,000 to build. However, Horatio would die of cancer while traveling in Europe in 1896 and never see the house completed. It sat unoccupied until 1919, when the Garret Family lent the house to the Red Cross as an institution for blinded servicemen in World War I. In 1921, the Jesuits from Loyola College purchased the house and 20 surrounding acres from the Garret Family to relocate their campus from Calvert Street. The college initially used the house for academic space, but in 1924 converted it into the Jesuit priest‚Äôs residence and renamed the house Jesuit House. The house was expanded in 1939, but was severely damaged by a fire in 1955. The building was rebuilt and significantly expanded from 1956 to 1958. In 1992, Loyola undertook a $6 million renovation to Jesuit House to consolidate 16 academic departments into a newly converted Humanities Center. The Jesuit priests were relocated to a smaller residence across Millbrook Rd called Millbrook House, now known as Ignatius House. The renovation included a 30,000 square foot addition to the rear of the former Jesuit House. The college hired architecture firm Frank Gant Architects to oversee the renovation. In 2011, the popular Netflix drama series House of Cards filmed scenes inside the Humanities Center. Today the Humanities Center serves a number of departments and offices, houses the office of the president, the admissions office and includes a popular dining area known as the refectory.

He received his Ph.D. in Korean Literature from Korea University in 1960 and embarked on a career that combined journalism and fiction writing. He served as the head of the culture department at Minguk Daily, Kyunghyang Daily News, and The Dong-a Ilbo; and subsequently became the editor-in-chief of The Dong-a Ilbo, a position he held until he was dismissed in 1980.\\"Choi Il-Nam\\" LTI Korea Datasheet available at LTI Korea Library or online at: Work After publishing fewer than two dozen stories in the 1950s and 1960s, Choi became more prolific in the 1970s, which featured his first book of fiction, People of Seoul. Choi's novels fall into two broad categories. His works prior to 1980 often portray a person from the countryside coming to the rapidly urbanizing and industrializing city where they succeed in building a new life. Despite the characters‚Äô success, however, the industrializing city is always shown to be founded on the relative poverty of the countryside, pointing to the sacrifice of the latter in achieving the success of the former. In his early novels, Choi wished to show the dark side of industrial development. Following his forced dismissal from journalism in 1980, Choi's stories shifted to a more intense criticism of social reality. But rather than landing sharp attacks on society, his later works are constructed so as to point to everyday human egotism existing in pockets across the social landscape, or to describe powerless individuals alienated by power.\\"ÏµúÏùºÎÇ®\\" biographical PDF available at LTI Korea Library or online at: Works in translation * The Lone Wolf, in Anthology of Korean Literary Vol.1 (1988) * Ballad in Modern Korean Fiction An Anthology (2005) Works in Korean (partial) Short Story Collections * Seoul salamdeul (Seoulites, 1975) * Geu ddae mal i isseossne (There Was Talk Then, 1989) * Hiteulleona jindallae (Hitler and Azaleas, 1991) * Seongnyu (Pomegranate, 2004) Novels * Geuligo heundeullineun bae (And Then the Rocking Ship, 1984) * Hayan son (The White Hand, 1994) * Mannyeonpil gwa papiluseu (Pen and Papyrus, 1997).

Placed on sale on July 14, 1845, this was the nation's first provisional stamp to be issued by a local post office in response to the congressional postal reform act that had taken effect two weeks earlier. That law, passed on March 3, 1845, standardized nationwide mail rates, with the result that the use of stamps became a practical and reliable method of postal prepayment. Before standardization, the many different postal rates in different jurisdictions had made fees too unpredictable to prepay all letters with stamps as a matter of course, with the result that recipients of letters‚Äîrather than senders‚Äîgenerally paid the postage on them. Baltimore announced the issue of a provisional stamp one day after New York, on July 15, and New Haven soon followed. The New York issue has been cited as \\"the most elegantly executed and widely used of the group of provisionals issued by eleven different [U. S. post] officesThe other ten cities to issue provisionals were Alexandria (D. C.), Annapolis (MD), Baltimore (MD), Boscawen (NH), Brattleboro (VT), Lockport (NY), Millbury (MA), New Haven (CT), Providence (RI) and St. Louis (MO). between 1845 and 1847.\\" The Frelinghuysen Collection, Sale 1020, Siegel Auction Galleries, March 28, 2012, \\"New York, New York\\" p. 70. Production Preparations for issuing the New York provisional were among the first acts of the city's Postmaster, Robert H. Morris, who took office on May 21, 1845 (the previous year he had completed a term as the 64th Mayor of New York). For the production, Morris contracted a leading security printer specializing in banknotes, Rawdon, Wright & Hatch. Creating a design around Gilbert Stuart's portrait of George Washington, the firm produced an engraving plate that printed forty stamp images; experts originally believed the number of stamps to have been fifty or one hundred, but the plating efforts of philatelist Abraham Hatfield in 1921 ultimately proved the sheet to be eight horizontal rows of five. Morris received a bill for $55.01 and the first batch of stamps on June 12, and that day he sent copies of the letter excerpted below to postmasters in Boston, Philadelphia, Albany and Washington, enclosing a sample stamp in each: While other cities would see fit to offer more than one provisional denomination ‚Äî Providence printed 5¬¢ and 10¬¢ stamps, while the St. Louis Bears appeared in 5¬¢, 10¬¢ and 20¬¢ values ‚Äî Morris deemed a single stamp sufficient for New York. This decision reflected New York's central location in the cluster of major coastal cities: the 5¬¢ postal rate covered the cost of transporting mail any distance up to three hundred miles, and little of New York's correspondence went further (the situation was otherwise in Providence and far-off St. Louis). Millbury Postmaster's Provisional, 1846Given that New York was then the base for most of the security printing firms that produced bank notes and other certificates for local financial institutions around the nation, it is not surprising that New York's provisional stamp would exemplify the highest available standards of design and production. That smaller cities could not necessarily take state-of-the-art printing facilities for granted is shown by the accompanying illustration of the only other Provisional of this era that employed an image of George Washington, printed from a wood-cut die and issued by the Millbury, MA post office in 1846. The Postmasters' provisionals offered by U. S. municipalities in these years helped familiarize and popularize the use of stamps for postal prepayment in preparation for the eventual national issue, and in this process, the New York issue played a key role. Distribution Although New York Provisional, introduced on July 14, 1845, was the first stamp ever issued by a local U. S. Postmaster, its newness proved no barrier to its acceptance by the public; indeed, copies have been found on letters dated July 15. New Yorkers were already familiar with stamps previously offered by private mail carriers. Indeed, they were quite accustomed to seeing stamps that bore George Washington's image. In February 1842, a New York carrier, the City Despatch Post, had printed a rather crude 3¬¢ Washington issue for use by its customers (the first adhesive postage stamp produced in the Western hemisphere); and the service offered a second version of that Washington stamp with modified lettering several months later when the U. S. Post Office purchased the company as a subsidiary for continued local mail pick-up and delivery. The New York Provisional was available only at the city's post office, and to guarantee authenticity, the Postmaster or one of his representatives initialed every stamp in red ink. Morris's RHM is present on only a small percentage of the stamps; most of this secretarial drudgery fell to the younger of the two brothers-in-law he had hired as his Assistant Postmasters: 23-year-old Alonzo Castle Monson, whose ACM became ubiquitous. These provisionals enjoyed wide use. In all, Rawdon, Wright & Hatch made eighteen shipments of the Provisionals to the New York Post office, the last of which ‚Äî on January 7, 1847 ‚Äî brought the total of stamps delivered to 143,600. The design and production quality of this issue was so high that when the U. S. Post Office set about issuing national postage stamps several months later, it immediately contracted the firm (now renamed Rawdon, Wright, Hatch and Edson) to print them, bypassing the normal competitive bidding process. The appearance of the first U. S. national postage stamps on July 1, 1847 put an end to the necessity for provisionals. For the 1847 U. S. stamps, the printer furnished a design similar in style to that of the provisional issue but more than 20% smaller in size.Lester G. Brookman, The United States Postage Stamps of the Nineteenth Century, Volume I, 1847‚Äì1857 (David G. Phillips Publishing Company, North Miami, 1989). No subsequent U. S. definitive issue, even the so-called large banknotes of 1870-1890, would be as large as the New York Postmaster's Provisional. Legacy New York Postmaster's Provisionals exist in a welter of collectible varieties which differ widely in value on the philatelic market. Concerned about counterfeit stamps, the postmaster had decided to initial each stamp, with the help of his assistants, which ultimately produced several possible variations on the marking of the stamps. In the Scott catalogue, used copies bearing the most common form of the postmaster's brother Alonzo Castle Monson's \\"ACM\\" initialling are valued at $500, but this sum rises for the \\"ACM\\" examples in which the letters are connected, or are separated by periods. Unsigned copies fetch still more. Those with postmaster Robert H. Morris's \\"RHM\\" fetch several thousands; and even that amount must be greatly multiplied for the inordinately scarce copies bearing the rarest initials, \\"MM\\" or \\"MMJr\\", those of Alonzo's older brother Marcena Monson Jr. Unused examples also fetch a premium ‚Äî particularly those with gum, which are quite rare. While most of the stamps were printed on a bluish wove paper, different paper types are occasionally found, and examples on these, too, can be quite costly. The stamps have been a perennial favorite of collectors. For example, Henry G. Lapham received a gold medal at the 1926 New York International Philatelic Exhibition for his collection of New York Postmaster's Provisionals, which included more than 700 of the stamps, including six ones with the rare \\"RHM\\", and a complete plate assembled from forty of the stamps.

The deadline for the survey was Monday, 9 May 2011 (Europatag). The results of the evaluation have been published step by step since May 2013. In Germany, the population figures for the federal government, the L√§nder and communes as well as results from the building and housing census were announced on 31 May 2013. Framework of the European Union=Prehistory In the past, Member States of the European Union have carried out censuses in self-government, which were difficult to compare with each other due to different catalogs of questions. The different surveying dates and periods also differed significantly. For example, the last census in the Federal Republic of Germany took place in 1987. [1] At the time, Germany was still divided. The last census in the GDR took place in 1981. In Austria, every 10 years has been raised (intermittently), since the census of 2011 is in the time series of the last census of 2001. In 2000/2001 an EU-wide census took place, but Germany and Sweden did not participate . In the future, every ten years Europe-wide censuses are to follow. Objectives Through the common census, various data used by Eurostat, which play an important role in the policy of the European Union, are to have a common basis and be reliable and comparable. For example, the allocation of funding from EU structural funds depends on the demography of a region. The number of inhabitants also plays an important role for a country's vote weight in the Council of Ministers. With the census, at least from November 2012 complete statistics are to be produced Europe-wide. Individual countries have published an overview of the evaluation just a few months after the census. EU legal foundations EU Regulation 763/2008 of 9 July 2008 obliged the Member States of the European Union to collect data from a fixed catalog of characteristics for the 2011 census. This is intended to make the results comparable across the EU. How the data are collected in the individual Member States is optional. EU guidelines on the topics of the census As the 2011 census is held throughout the European Union, the Community has defined valid criteria for all Member States to obtain comparable data. In Regulation (EC) No 763/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 on population and housing censuses which was published in the Official Journal of the European Union (edition L218 of 13 August 2008) and entered into force on 2 September of that year. The NUTS and LAU systems are used to define the administrative units. In addition, there is a distinction between derived and non-derived themes in the subject list of the population and the housing. On the NUTS 3 and LAU 2 levels, personal data such as place of residence, gender, age, family status and nationality are collected from which findings on the total population, households and core families are derived. At national level and with NUTS 1 and NUTS 2, information on education and professional activity is added. The statistics on the dwellings include, among other things, the type of accommodation / dwelling, the inhabitants, the usable area and the year of construction as well as the derived theme of the housing density. National=Germany In Germany the Census 2011 was carried out in a register-based procedure. Census Covenants With a cabinet decision of 29 August 2006, the then federal government of the CDU / CSU and the SPD decided that Germany would participate in the EU-wide Census 2011 with a register- based procedure On December 12, 2007 the Census Preparation Act 2011 was announced in the Federal Law Gazette Which entered into force the following day. The preparatory work, which was regulated by this Act, included the setting up of an address and building register as well as the transmission of the addresses of the owner of the apartment. The concrete implementation of the Census 2011 in Germany took place according to the 2011 Census Act, which was announced in the Federal Law Gazette on 15 July 2009 And entered into force the day after. This law defined the deadline (9 May 2011), the survey characteristics (age, sex, school leaving, living space etc.) and the persons liable to pay. In addition, it contained statements on the aggregation of the survey parts and the eradication periods of the auxiliary features. Under this Act, the Federal Government granted the L√§nder a financial allocation of EUR 250 million on 1 July 2011 to offset the costs. On 16 July 2010, the Arbeitskreis Census imposed a constitutional complaint against the Census Act (Az 1 BvR 1865/10), which was supported by 13.077 citizens. The Federal Constitutional Court did not accept the appeal by decision of 21 September 2010. On its own information portal [6] the initiative provides independent information. E register-supported census Unlike previous decades, there was no traditional census, in which all residents were questioned. Instead, most of the data were collected from administrative registers - especially those from municipalities and the Federal Agency for Labor. Data supplemented by three surveys In the building and housing census, the owners provided information on their properties, which did not provide administrative data covering the entire area. In the household survey, interviewers identified personal data of residents in randomly selected households. These samples are about 10% of the population. Data on the inhabitants of nursing homes, correctional institutions and other special facilities were collected during the survey of the special areas. The procedure of the register-based census should lead to equally robust results as a traditional census. At the same time, taxpayers should incur lower costs. While a new census according to the conventional method would have cost an estimated one billion euros, according to the German Institute for Economic Research, the new model costs about 300 million euros. Estimates by the Federal Statistical Office estimated to be about 1.4 billion euros for a traditional census and around 450 million euros for a register-based census. The information portal www.zensus2011.de mentions total costs of ‚Ç¨710 million. Surveys Building and Housing Counting All owners or administrators of buildings and apartments received a questionnaire by mail and were obliged to provide true information. The questions concerning the buildings related to the type, the year of construction and the property conditions as well as the heating. In the dwellings, information about the occupants, the owners, the usage and the size were required. The homeowners had to return the questionnaires to the authorities within 14 days, in order to avoid a dunning procedure. Endurance survey In order to carry out the household survey, the survey sites nationwide cited around 80,000 interviewers. All selected citizens were legally obliged to answer the questions truthfully; In the case of refusal, the order of a compulsory money threatened. The questionnaire consisted of a total of 46 questions. These were related to nationality, religion, family status, immigration to the Federal Republic, school and vocational training and current professional activity. People who were not members of a public-law religious society could state their faith in the eighth question. This was the only question to be answered voluntarily Survey of special areas The survey of citizens in dormitories and community accommodation took place in a similar way to the household survey. In the non-sensitive special areas, the residents had to state whether a household could be run. In sensitive institutions, such as prisons, emergency accommodation or psychiatric hospitals, the data on the people living there were indirectly collected with the aid of the facility managers. In order to protect the inhabitants particularly in their precarious situation, the questions were very limited Scientific check Official statistics have tested the new method of the census in the years 2001 to 2003 The Mannheim Center for Surveys, Methods and Analyzes and the Chair for Economic and Social Statistics at the University of Trier under the direction of Ralf M√ºnnich dealt with the research of a methodology for the small-scale evaluation of the sample results (small area methods). A sample plan was developed that combines moderate costs and a low level of interviews with high-quality data from the census. For this purpose, new survey methods should be investigated and tested for their practical suitability. On 14 September 2007, the Federal Minister of the Interior convened a scientific commission to scientifically support and support the census and the evaluation of their data The President of the Council for Social and Economic Data, Gert G. Wagner, professor of economics at the TU Berlin and research director at the DIW Berlin (German Institute for Economic Research), was appointed chairman of the \\"Census Commission\\". The task of the Census Commission is to examine the concepts, methods and procedures developed by the Federal, State and Federal Statistical Offices for the Census-based Census 2011, including the supplementary sample, to accompany the relevant implementation work critically and constructively, as well as recommendations for further action . On January 22, 2009, the Zensus Commission adopted an opinion on the feature catalog in the Cabinet drafting of the Census Ordinance (CensusG2011). In doing so, it explicitly regrets the fact that the EU is compulsorily restricted by the EU Statute and maintains the additional features required by it. A census feature of the language spoken in the household, the scientists consider the integration indicator to be much more meaningful than their religious affiliation. Further required characteristics are number of children per woman, commuter connections, energy source of the heating as well as net-net rent. Privacy policy \\"Do you want the total coverage?\\": Protest banner at the old main post office in Leipzig (26 June 2011) Data protectors criticize the extensive collection of personal data by the state without sufficient education of the citizens and fears in the face of possible covetousness in the state and economy an abuse of the sensitive information. Since personal data are gathered from numerous sources without the consent or notification of the data subjects, the data from the reporting offices and authorities would be misused. This is in breach of the requirements of the 1983 censorship verdict. The data protection authorities also see a problem in the fact that, for example, a central data collection system collects and records, among other things, who has set up an information block. People from witness protection programs, former Nazis and radicals, stalking victims, certain judges or celebrities are affected. The Federal Statistical Office refers to the so-called prohibition, which excludes the transfer of the collected data to other authorities, and the earliest possible deletion of charac- teristics such as names and addresses. These measures are not sufficient for data protectionists. Even after a distance of personal data from the database, they can re-identify themselves from the \\"anonymous\\" data using computers and information from other sources. A true anonymisation is thus not given. Questions about religion The questions about belonging to a religious society and the creed also provide for controversial discussions. According to critics, they go beyond what is required by the EU. The question 8 (the direction of faith) is voluntary and can only be answered if, in question 7 (religious society), the membership of \\"no public-law religious society\\" has been crossed. Thus, a user of the census data could automatically view members of a public-law religious community as followers of the religion, regardless of their actual belief. In addition, Question 8 is not further broken up between other religious world views and non-religious views of the world (e.g., humanism, atheism, pacifism) in the possibility of answering \\"other religion, faith or belief\\". The spokesman of the Federal Statistical Office stated in this context: \\"The consequence of this is that the group of atheists (but also those of the other religions) can not be proven in the censorship results. The results of the census will therefore be that we have information about the large religious currents explicitly listed in the questionnaire, but will not know about the spread of other religions and atheism. \\"The EU Eurobarometer\\" Social Values, Science and Technology \\" In 2005, atheists had previously been recorded as a separate group Interviewer Some surveyors ended their activities prematurely. They criticized the perceived too great workload in the household survey and criticized the unfriendly and repulsive reactions of some citizens who had to be paid. Mishaps In Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein unjustified warnings against allegedly defaultered house and apartment owners caused anger. In January 2012, 50,000 complaints were sent by order of the Statistical Office for Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein with the threat of compulsory measures, On which a week later 40,000 had to be declared void due to errors in a commissioned company. Posting permissions With the issuance of the questionnaires, the preliminary questionnaire, as well as the actual building and housing census, an envelope for the reply was enclosed by the statistical offices of the L√§nder. These envelopes were not postage-free, but a reimbursement of costs was not foreseen under Section 15 (3) of the Bundesstatistikgesetz. In the case of parts of the interviewees, the collection of the posture caused displeasure. Result The population of Germany, which was updated as of December 31, 2011, was subsequently adjusted to 80.3 million on the basis of census results. It is thus about 1.5 million inhabitants lower than the figures reproduced on the basis of the update of the census of 1987 (Federal Republic of Germany including Berlin (West)) and the registry data of the New Federal States of 3 October 1990. This corresponds to an error of 1.9% A correction of the population update by 31 December 2012 on the basis of the results of the 2011 census is to be made by 5 August 2013. The population level as at 31 March 2013 should be published again on the regular date (15 August 2013) As a result of the changed relative population shares of the federal states, there will be redistributions for country financings and sales tax distribution for the years 2011 and 2012. In the run-up to the census, the L√§nder had agreed to limit the additional payments for 2011 to one third and for 2012 to two-thirds. From 2013 onwards the changed population will be fully taken into account. Austria In Austria, questionnaires were filled out for a large part of the population, as a register census was carried out. [31] The press called them \\"the census that no one noticed\\" Methodology of the census For the census, a special data processing software was developed for Statistics Austria (STAT), the Austrian Statistical Central Office, with which data collection, processing, processing, analysis and processing was implemented via a central data warehouse The data records already available from other Austrian authorities, departments and other institutions were analyzed. According to Statistik Austria, the costs amounted to 9.9 million euros, while the traditional method would have cost 72 million euros. [The system had been tested with the sample census as of October 31, 2006, in which data were collected on a sample-by- sample basis using questionnaires, with which the consolidated register data were verified. Data sources and data protection A total of 15 databases will be collected at the 2011 census: Basic register (basic data) ZMR - Central Register of Persons as Register of Persons (BMI) GWR - Building and Housing Register (STAT) UR - Company register (including LFR - agricultural and forestry company and company register) (STAT) Austrian Social Insurance Fund (HVSV) Control data (BMF) AMS for the unemployed and third-country workers (AMS) BSR education register Student and student stock (STAT) Supplementary register (comparative data) Family Aid Register (BMSG) Federal Staff Information System (BKA) Personnel Information Systems of the Federal States Central Foreign Trade Register (BMI) Data of the social assistance agencies of the L√§nder Presence and civilian service file (BMLV or BMI) Vehicle Register (BMI) N all these data are already recorded by the EU. The data records are anonymised according to the Federal Law on the protection of personal data already in the special databases, and are only brought together in Statistics Austria in a 127-digit encryption code of the person, which according to Statistik Austria is also to assure sufficient data security according to the most modern requirements. The legal basis for this was created by the e-government law, the technology was developed together with the authorities responsible for data protection and e-government in the Federal Chancellery. In extreme cases of exceptional data inconsistencies, the data are returned to a person under the supervision of the Data Protection Commission, the Ordinary Register of Registers. In order to prevent \\"reporting tourism\\" on the part of the municipalities - in the temptation to achieve the highest possible number of inhabitants and, as a result, better funding, - the recording of reported residences was extended to 180 days before the deadline. Critical or sensitive points which, for example, have led to violent discussions in Germany, in particular the elevation of religious affinity, have not been taken up from the outset Evaluation software and publication The original data supplied by Statistik Austria in the original form are mirrored during the so-called \\"staging area\\". The data is then transferred to the link database, the so-called Central Datawarehouse (CDW). This means that the original source is not lost during evaluation processes of any kind, but is always available as a reference material. In addition, a front-end optimized for official-statistical purposes was developed with the manufacturer. The results are published as usual in the Austrian Statistical Yearbook, whose volume was published in the summer of the year (historically there were censuses in which the evaluation was only completed four years later), and this is freely accessible As well as numerous detailed evaluations, which are partly published in the other special publications (such as the local directory of the population) and on the website of Statistik Austria. In addition, Statistik Austria offers a modern service provider - also within the strict framework of the data protection legislation - with the option of ordering more specific statistics. Final results of the 2011 registry census On 21 June 2013, Statistik Austria announced the final results of the 2011 register listing in a press release. In this figure, the number of inhabitants for Austria is 8,401,940, which represents an increase of 4.6 per cent of inhabitants compared to the last census of 2001. Carinthia is the only province that has lost its inhabitants. Future counts The new software also makes it possible to carry out a small counting every year, which can be used as a basis for financial balancing between the federal government, the L√§nder and municipalities. Until now, these data were always out of date and had to be extrapolated.

History Following their debut album Damaged (1981), Black Flag underwent several personnel shifts and debuted a number of songs in their live shows. In contrast to the straightforward hardcore punk of the debut, the new songs tended toward being slower in tempo with pronounced metal elements and included funk and jazz touches. The band found themselves locked in a protracted legal battle with Unicorn Records, a subsidiary of MCA Records, who had distributed Damaged. A legal injunction prevented Black Flag from recording under their name, severely cutting into the band members' income.

Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1982 Life There is little information available about the life and training of Peter van Boucle. He claimed that he was a pupil of Frans Snyders but there are no written sources available in Antwerp that support this contention. However, there are stylistic similarities in his works which suggest that he worked in the vicinity of Frans Snijders.Peter van Boucle at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Still life of fruit, vegetables and game on a table, with a boy Van Boucle's father Carel was an engraver, who had become a master in the Guild of St. Luke of Antwerp in 1603 and emigrated to Paris in 1617.Peter van Boucle on Larousse Peter van Boucle was registered with his father in Paris in 1623. At that time many Flemish artists were active in the Parisian district of Saint-Germain des-Pr√®s.Peter van Boucle on the site Joconde He worked for a while with the still life painter Lubin Baugin in the studio of Simon Vouet. Here they made designs for tapestries (which have not been located). He probably also was familiar with the still life painters Jacques Linard and Louise Moillon, since his work shows affinities with theirs.Lesley Stevenson. \\"Boucle, Pierre.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press.

Works Apples, pears, grapes and peaches on a pewter dish on a table top Van Boucle signed his works with the initials PVB and his works are therefore sometimes confused with those of other artists such as Pieter van den Bos. Van Boucle mainly painted still lifes and paintings of animals. He is considered one of the best Flemish animal painters, together with Pieter Boel and Nicasius Bernaerts. Van Boucle often animated his still life compositions with cats and dogs, much like his master Frans Snyders. He worked for several patrons, including nobles and courtiers as well as hop keepers alike. His works are now mostly in private collections. Van Boucle painted many works that allude to wealth and luxury. These elements are visible in his still lifes, which show the luster of fruits and vegetables that contrast with the glow of jewelry, silverware and other objects. He was very adept at representing the smoothness of Chinese porcelain that is often present in his paintings.

Registered in December, 2005 with the Yunnan Department of Civil Affairs, Heart to Heart uses a community-based social service approach, and in addition to providing a broad range of services, also participates in research and policy advocacy.China Development Brief (in Chinese) Mission Heart to Heart's mission is ‚Äúto develop a caring, tolerant, supportive and integrated society in conjunction with and for the migrant worker community.‚ÄùHeart to Heart English Introduction Within the migrant worker community, Heart to Heart specifically targets women, children, elderly, disabled people, and other disadvantaged groups.Shuqi Jia, Shalini Kishan, Wanrong Liu, Shreya Sen.\\"Gender Dimensions of the Urban Experience: The Case of Migrant Women Among the Urban Poor of Kunming and Kolkata.\\" Methods and organization Heart to Heart utilizes a broad-based social work approach to helping migrants, and focuses on facilitating community involvement in its work. The organization works to integrate all available resources pertaining to migrant workers, such as the government, large foundations, community organizations, and volunteers, and approaches issues on case-by-case, small group, community-wide, and broader societal level bases. Its main goals are the direct provision of services to migrant workers, research on issues relating to migrant workers in Kunming, and policy advocacy. The organization's structure and mission is broken up into ten major focuses, which comprise three larger branches of the organization: Children's Services, Comprehensive Community Services, and Research Advocacy and Training. The Children's Services branch includes a Children's Activities Center, Outreach Services, and Community School Work. The Comprehensive Community Services‚Äô branch consist of a Women's Cooperative Development Organization, Domestic Violence Intervention, a Migrant Worker Legal Rights Station, Minority Social Work, and Elderly Social Work. Finally, the Research Advocacy and Training branch includes Research and Policy Advocacy and a Professional Training Center. As of 2010, Heart to Heart had twenty-one staff members, including eight full-time social workers.Gupta, Shalene.\\"Interview: Xiang Rong.\\"Go Kunming. Additionally, the organization employs researchers and social workers from various colleges and universities, and makes use of many volunteers to support the organization's services. Services=Children‚Äôs services Heart to Heart runs a Children's Activities Center in the middle of a migrant settlement in Kunming.\\"Smile! We are working towards a positive future!

Heart to Heart also organizes children's events, such as games and movie nights, sponsors weekend family outings for migrant worker families, and visits local schools. An additional focus of the organization is promoting child safety. Heart to Heart works with local police, the local government, and the surrounding community to develop strategies to ensure the safety of migrant worker children, and also runs a personal safety awareness education program for children. Past initiatives have included a 2010 community activities series entitled ‚ÄúMigrant Children Safety Awareness,‚Äù and a 2009-2010 initiative entitled ‚ÄúUsing Community Outreach Methods to Explore Child Safety Services.\\" Outreach activities Heart to Heart organizes community events on weekends, holidays, and over the summer, both for migrant workers and for the broader community. Through these events, the organization aims to connect migrant workers and also to educate the broader community about the issues facing migrant workers in order to overcome existing prejudices within society. Heart to Heart's mobile service unit allows the organization to spread its work into other migrant communities located further away; additionally, two or three times each week Heart to Heart's social workers are sent to visit rural villages outside the city. Recycling efforts / women‚Äôs cooperative development Recycling Resource Center = Heart to Heart's Recycling Resource Center collects donations of used goods and employs migrant workers to sort and clean the donated items. Some of these goods are then used in the Green Handicraft Workshop, while others are sold in the Mutual Aid Shop. = Green Handicraft Workshop = The Green Handicraft Workshop employs migrant women, training them in handicrafts such as sewing and embroidery, and providing them with a source of employment. In the workshop, the women draw from ethnic designs to create goods for public sale; additionally, the women can bring their children along with them when they work. = Mutual Aid Shop = The Mutual Aid Shop sells second-hand goods to migrant workers at low prices. Additionally, Heart to Heart works to create community awareness of ‚Äúgreen collar‚Äù workers‚Äîworkers (many of whom are migrant workers) who work in the trash collection sector. The organization believes that by increasing the public's awareness and knowledge about the sorts of jobs these workers perform, the public will afford these workers greater respect and also be more likely to participate in recycling efforts. Domestic violence intervention One strategy Heart to Heart employs involves providing direct services within individual households. In cases of domestic violence, Heart to Heart sends social workers to migrant families‚Äô homes to provide counseling for the whole family. Research and policy advocacy Heart to Heart regularly supports researchers from various colleges and universities interested in studying issues related to migrant workers, and also advocates for policies they deem will alleviate problems migrant workers face. In 2010, the organization prepared a requested report for the Provincial Women's Federation containing research and policy advice.

He wrote episodes of numerous television series, including Baretta, Charlie's Angels, Highway to Heaven, Hell Town, Kojak, Matlock, Charley Hannah, High Mountain Rangers and NYPD Blue. Fournier was born in 1936 in Wichita, Kansas, and raised in both Chicago and Omaha, Nebraska. His parents decided to call him \\"Rift\\" after a dispute over what they would name their son. Fournier was acting and screenwriting at the Omaha Community Playhouse by the time he was 13 years old. He attended a Jesuit school, where he excelled as an athlete. Fournier contracted polio during his Junior year in high school. On a Sunday morning in 1953, Fournier collapsed while getting out of bed to answer the telephone. He never regained his ability to walk and remained in a wheelchair for the rest of his life. Rift Fournier never let his disability dissuade him from pursuing his career.

It is a concept \\"based on individuals' emotion knowledge, which includes knowledge about the causes of emotion, about their bodily sensations and expressive behavior, and about the possible means of modifying them\\" (Niedenthal, 2006, 157).Niedenthal, P. M., Ric, F., & Krauth-Gruber, S. (2006). Psychology of emotion: Interpersonal, experiential, and cognitive approaches (Chapter 5, Regulation of Emotions, pp. 155-194). New York, NY: Psychology Press. In other words, expressive suppression signifies the act of masking facial giveaways (see facial expression) in order to hide an underlying emotional state (see affect). In fact, simply suppressing the facial expressions that accompany certain emotions can affect \\"the individual's experience of emotion\\" (Niedenthal, 2006, 165). According to a study done by Kopel & Arkowitz (1974),Kopel, S. A., & Arkowitz, H. S. (1974). Role playing as a source of self-observation and behavior change. Journal of Personality & Social Psychology, 29(5), 677-686. repressing the facial expressions associated with pain actually decreased the experience of pain in participants. However, Niedenthal (2006) states that \\"there is little evidence that the suppression of spontaneous emotional expression leads to decrease in emotional experience and physiological arousal apart from the manipulation of the pain expressions\\" (165). According to Gross & Levenson's (1993)Gross, J. J., & Levenson, R. W. (1993). Emotional suppression: Physiology, self-report, and expressive behavior. Journal of Personality & Social Psychology, 64(6), 970-986. study in which subjects watched a disgusting film while suppressing or not suppressing their expressions, suppression produced increased blinking. However, suppression also produced a decreased heart rate in participants and self-reports did not reflect that suppression had an effect on disgust experience. While it is unclear from Gross & Levenson's (1993) study whether suppression successfully diminishes the experience of emotions, it can be concluded that expressive suppression does not completely inhibit all facial movements and expressions (e.g. blinking of the eyes). Niedenthal (2006) argues that expressive suppression works to decrease the experience of positive emotions whereas it does not successfully decrease the experience of negative emotions. If the suppression of facial expressions does not diminish negative emotions that one experiences, why is it such a common practice? It may be that expressive suppression serves more of a social purpose than it serves a purpose for the individual. In a study done by Kleck et al. in 1976, participants were told to suppress facial expressions of pain during the reception of electric shocks. Specifically, \\"in one study the subjects were induced to exaggerate or minimize their facial expressions in order to fool a supposed audience\\" (Laird 27).Laird, J. D. (2007). Feelings: The perception of self. New York: Oxford University Press. This idea of covering up an internal experience in front of observers could be the true reason that expressive suppression is utilized in social situations. \\"In everyday life, suppression may serve to conform individuals' outward appearance to emotional norms in a given situation, and to facilitate social interaction\\" (Niedenthal, 2006, 168). In this way, hiding negative emotions may cause for more successful social relationships by preventing conflict, stifling the spread of negative emotions, and protecting an individual from negative judgments made by others (Niedenthal 2006). Component Expressive suppression is a response-focused emotion regulation strategy (Niedenthal 2006). This strategy involves an individual voluntarily suppressing their outward emotional expressions. Expressive suppression has a direct relationship to our emotional experiences and is significant in communication studies. Individuals who suppress their emotions are seeking to control their actions and are seeking to maintain a positive social image (Niedenthal 2006). Expressive suppression involves reducing facial expression and controlling positive and negative feelings of emotion. This type of emotion regulation strategy can have negative emotional and psychological effects on individuals. Emotional suppression reduces expressive behavior significantly. As many researchers have concluded, though emotional suppression decreases outward expressive emotions, it does not decrease our negative feelings and emotional arousal (Niedenthal 2006). Different forms of emotion regulation affect our response trajectory of emotions. We target situations for regulation by the process of selecting the situations we are exposed to or by modifying the situation we are in. Emotion suppression relates to the behavioral component of emotion. Expressive suppression has physiological influences such as decreasing heart rate, increasing blood pressure, and increasing sympathetic activation (Dan-Glauser & Gross, 2011).Dan-Glauser, E. S., & Gross, J. J. (2011). The temporal dynamics of two response-focused forms of emotion regulation: Experiential, expressive, and autonomic consequences. Psychophysiology, 48(9), 1309-1322. doi:10.1111/j.1469-8986.2011.01191.x Expressive suppression requires self- control. We use self-control when handling our emotion-based expressions in public. It is believed that the use of expressive suppression has a negative connection with a human's well-being (K√ºhn et al., 2011).K√ºhn S., Gallinat J., Brass M. (2011) Keep calm and carry on: Structural correlates of expressive suppression of emotions. PLoS ONE 6(1): e16569. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0016569 Expressive suppression has been found to occur late, after the peripheral physiological response or emotion process is triggered. K√ºnh et al. (2011) compare this strategy to vetoing actions. This type of emotion regulation strategy is considered a method which strongly resists various urges and voluntarily inhibits actions. K√ºhn et al. (2011) also posited the notion that expression suppression may be internally controlled and that emotional responses are targeted by suppression efforts. One of the characteristics of expressive suppression, a response-based strategy, is that it occurs after an activated response. Larsen et al. (2013)Larsen, J. K., Vermulst, A. A., Geenen, R., van Middendorp, H., English, T., Gross, J. J., & Engels, R. E. (2013). Emotion regulation in adolescence: A prospective study of expressive suppression and depressive symptoms. Journal of Early Adolescence, 33(2), 184-200. doi:10.1177/0272431611432712> claim expressive suppression to be one of the less effective emotion regulation strategies. These researchers label expressive suppression as an inhibition to the behavioral display of emotion. Externalizers vs. internalizers Regarding emotion regulation, specifically expressive suppression, there are two groups that can be characterized by their different response patterns. These two groups are labeled externalizers and internalizers. Internalizers generally \\"show more skin conductance deflections and greater heart rate acceleration than do externalizers\\" when attempting to suppress facial expressions during a potentially emotional event (Buck, 2003, 56).Buck, R. (2003). Emotional expression, suppression, and control: Nonverbal communication in cultural context. Journal of Intercultural Communication Research, 32(1), 47-65.\\" This signifies that internalizers are able to successfully employ expressive suppression while experiencing physiological arousal (Buck, 2003). However, when asked to describe their feelings, internalizers do not usually speak about themselves or specific feelings, which could be a sign of alexithymia (Buck, 2003). Alexithymia is defined as the inability to verbally explain an emotional experience or a feeling. Peter Sifneos first used this word in the realm of psychiatry in 1972 and it literally means \\"having no words for emotions\\" (Muller, When a patient has no story to tell: Alexithymia).Muller, R. J. (2000). When a patient has no story to tell: Alexithymia. Psychiatric Times, 17(7), 1-6. http://homepages.spa.umn.edu/~larry/CLASS/NOTHING/READINGS/NoStorytoTell.pdf Those who are able to consistently suppress their facial expressions (e.g. internalizers) may be experiencing symptoms of alexithymia. On the other hand, externalizers employ less expressive suppression in response to emotional experiences or other external stimuli and do not usually struggle with alexithymia. Gender differences Men and women do not equally utilize expressive suppression. Typically, men show less facial expression and employ more expressive suppression than do women (Buck, 2003). This behavior difference rooted in gender difference can be traced back to social norms that are taught to children at a young age. Young boys are implicitly taught that \\"big boys don't cry,\\" which is a lesson that encourages the suppression of emotional behavior in masculine individuals (Buck, 2003, 56). This suppression is a result of \\"the punishment and consequent conditioned inhibition of all expression of a given emotion\\" (Buck, 2003, 56). If a masculine individual expresses an emotion that is undesirable and society responds by punishing that behavior, that masculine individual will learn to suppress the socially unacceptable behavior. On the other hand, feminine individuals do not experience the same societal pressure to suppress their emotional expressions. Because feminine individuals are not as pressured to keep their emotions concealed, there is not a need for as much expressive suppression on their part. Vs. display rules Complete expressive suppression means that no facial expressions are visible to exemplify a given emotion. However, display rules are examples of a controlled form of expression management and \\"involve the learned manipulation of facial expression to agree with cultural conventions and interpersonal expectations in the pursuit of tactical and/or strategic social ends\\" (Buck, 2003, 57). The utilization of display rules differs from expressive suppression because when display rules are enacted, the action to manage expression is voluntary, controlled, and incorporates certain types of expressive behavior (Buck, 2003). Conversely, expressive suppression is involuntary and is the result of social pressures that shape subconscious behaviors. It is not a controlled action nor does expressive suppression involve the manipulation of voluntary expressions, it is only manifested in the absence of expression (Buck, 2003). There are three ways in which facial expression displays may be influenced: modulation, qualification, and falsification. Modulation refers to the act of showing a different amount of expression than one feels. Qualification requires the addition of an extra (unfelt) emotional expression to the expression of a felt emotion. Lastly, falsification has three separate components. Falsification incorporates expressing an unfelt emotion (simulation), expressing no emotion when an emotion is felt (neutralization), or concealing a felt emotion by expressing an unfelt emotion (masking) (Buck, 2003). A response-focused strategy Expressive suppression is an emotion management strategy that works to decrease positive emotional experiences, however, it has not been proven to reduce the experience of negative emotions. This strategy is a response- focused form of emotion regulation, which \\"refers to things we do once an emotion is underway and response tendencies have already been generated\\" (Srivastava et al., 2009, 883).Srivastava, S., Tamir, M., McGonigal, K. M., John, O. P., & Gross, J. J. (2009). The social costs of emotional suppression: A prospective study of the transition to college. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 96(4), 883-897. doi:10.1037/a0014755 Response-focused strategies are generally not as successful as antecedent-focused regulation strategies, which refers to \\"things we do, either consciously or automatically, before emotion-response tendencies have become fully activated\\" (Srivastava et al., 2009, 883). Srivastava et al. (2009) performed a study in which the effectiveness of students' use of expressive suppression was analyzed in the transition period between high school and college. This study concluded that \\"suppression is an antecedent of poor social functioning\\" in the domains of social support, closeness, and social satisfaction (Srivastava et al., 2009, 893). Psychological consequences Suppressing the expression of emotion is one of the most frequent emotion-regulation strategies utilized by human beings. Clinical traditions state that a person's psychological health is based upon how affective impulses are regulated; the consequences of affective regulation have become, therefore, a main focus of psychological researchers. Gross & Levenson (1993) explain how the psychological consequences directly related to expressive suppression are frequently disputed. Researchers such as Cannon (1927)Cannon, W. B. ( 1927). The James- Lange theory of emotion: A critical examination and alternative theory. American Journal of Psychology, 39, 106‚Äì 124. and Jones (1935)Jones, H. E. (1935). The galvanic skin reflex as related to overt emotional expression. American Journal of Psychology, 47, 241‚Äì251. state that suppressing a physical emotional response while emotionally aroused will increase the emotional experience due to concentration on suppressing that emotion. These researchers argue that common sense tells us emotions become more severe the longer they are bottled up. Other researchers such as Darwin (1872)Darwin, C. (1872). The expression of the emotions in man and animals. London: Murray. and Tomkins (1984)Tomkins, S. (1984). Affect theory. In K. R.Scherer & P.Ekman ( Eds.), Approaches to emotion (163‚Äì 195). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum. dispute this theory, saying that emotional expression is so significant to the overall emotional response that when suppression occurs, all other responses (e.g. physiological) are weakened. Darwin (1872) and Tomkins (1984) solidify this argument with the tradition that people are taught to count to ten when emotionally aroused in order to calm themselves down. If suppressing emotions were to increase the emotional experience, this counting exercise would only intensify a person's reactions; however, it has been deemed to do the opposite. Unfortunately, few studies have been carried out to test these hypotheses (Gross & Levenson, 1993). The idea that people have conflicting views on what is better - to bottle up emotions by counting to ten before acting/speaking or to release emotions as bottling them up is bad for your mental health - is of constant interest to researchers in the field of emotion. These differing views on such a commonplace human behavior suggest that expressive suppression is one of the more complicated emotion-regulation techniques. As a solution to these opposing ideas, it has been suggested (and mentioned in the Externalizers vs. Internalizers section above) that people have a tendency to be either emotionally expressive (externalizers) or inexpressive (internalizers). The habitual use of one expressive technique over the other leads to different psychological and physiological consequences over time. Expressive behavior is directly related to emotional suppression as it is assumed that internalizers consciously choose not to express themselves. However, this assumption has gone primarily untested with the exception of Notarius & Levenson (1979), whose research found that internalizers are more physiologically reactive to emotional stimuli than externalizers. One explanation for these findings was that when a behavioral emotional response is suppressed it must be released in other ways, in this case physiological reactions (Gross & Levenson, 1993). These findings lend themselves to the suggestion by Cannon (1927) and Jones (1935) that emotional suppression intensifies other reactions. It has also been suggested that illness and disease is increased by continued emotional suppression, especially the suppression of intensely aggressive emotions such as anger and hostility which can lead to hypertension and coronary heart-disease. As well as physical illness, expressive suppression is said to be the cause of mental illnesses such as depression. Many psychotherapists will try to relieve their patients' illness/strain by teaching them expressive techniques in a controlled environment or within the particular relationship in which their suppressed emotions are causing problems (Gross & Levenson, 1997).Gross, J. J., Levenson, R. W. (1997), Hiding feelings: The acute effects of inhibiting negative and positive emotion. Journal of Abnormal Psychology, Vol 106(1), Feb, 1997. pp. 95-103. A counter-argument to this idea suggests that expressive suppression is an important part of emotional regulation that needs to be learned due to its beneficial use in adulthood. Adults must learn to successfully suppress certain emotional responses (e.g. those to anger which could have destructive social consequences). However, then the question is whether or not to suppress all anger-related responses, or to release those less volatile in order to reduce the risk of contracting physical and mental illnesses. The Clinical Theory implies that there is an optimum level between total suppression and total expression which, during adulthood, a person must find in order to protect their physical and psychological being (Gross & Levenson 1997). While expressive suppression may be socially acceptable in certain situations, it cannot be considered a healthy practice at all times. Concealing and suppressing expressions can cause stress-related physiological reactions. Stress occurs because \\"the social disapproval and punishment of overt emotional expression that causes suppression is itself intimidating and stressful\\" (Buck, 2003, 57). There are several occupations which require the suppression of positive or negative emotions, such as estate agents masking their happiness when an offer is placed on a house to maintain their professionalism, or elementary-school teachers suppressing their anger so as to not upset their young students when teaching them right from wrong. Only in recent studies have researchers begun looking into the effects that continual suppression of emotion in the workplace has on people (Cote, 2005). Cote, S. (2005). A social-interaction model of the effects of emotion regulation on work strain. The Academy of Management, 30(3), 509-530. Cote (2005) notes that continual suppression causes strain on those utilizing it, especially on those who may be natural externalizers. Strain elicited by such suppression can cause an elevated heart-rate, increased anxiety, low commitment and other effects which can be detrimental to an employee. The common conception is that expressive suppression in the workplace is beneficial for the organization and dangerous for the employee over long periods of time. However, Cote (2005) found that factors contributing to the social dynamics of emotions determine when emotion regulation increases, decreases, or does not affect strain at all. The suppression of unpleasant emotions such as anger contribute to increasing high levels of strain. Link with depression Expressive suppression, as an emotion regulation strategy, serves different purposes such as supporting goal pursuits and satisfying hedonic needs (Larsen 2012).Larsen, J., Vermulst, A., Eisinga, R., English, T., Gross, J., Hofman, E., & Engels, R. (2012). Social coping by masking? Parental support and peer victimization as mediators of the relationship between depressive symptoms and expressive suppression in adolescents. Journal of Youth & Adolescence, 41(12), 1628-1642. doi:10.1007/s10964-012-9782-7 Though expressive suppression is considered a weak influence on the experience of emotion, it has other functions. Expressive suppression is a goal-oriented strategy which is guided by people's beliefs and potentially by abstract theories about emotion regulation (Larsen 2012). In a study by Larsen et al. (2012), the researchers looked at the positive association between expressive suppression and depressive symptoms among adults and adolescents which are influenced by parental support and peer victimization. They found a reciprocal relationship between parental support and depressive symptoms. The same was not true for the relationship between peer victimization and depressive symptoms. Depressive symptoms followed decreased perception of parental support one year later. They found that initial suppression occurred after increases in depressive symptoms one year later, yet depression did not occur after suppression. However, in a continuation of their original study, Larsen et al. (2012) found that this relationship between suppression and depression was reversed. Depressive symptoms occurred after the use of suppression, and suppression did not occur after future depressive symptoms (Larsen et al., 2012). Larsen et al. (2012) support that expressive suppression has physiological, social, and cognitive costs. Some evidence says that \\"depressed people judge their negative emotions as less socially acceptable\\" than non-depressed people (Larsen, 2012, 194). \\"Appraising one's emotions as unacceptable mediates the relationship between negative emotion intensity and use of suppression\\" (194). Negative social consequences As an appropriate level of expressive suppression is important for physiological and psychological health, it is equally as important for the maintenance of social situations. However, excessive use of expressive suppression can negatively affect social interactions. While expressive suppression may seem like an easier way of coping with emotions in society or of becoming more likable in a social environment, it actually alters behavior in a way that is visible and undesirable to others (Srivastava et al., 2009). Because expressive suppression is an action that occurs in social interactions, it is reasonable that this emotion regulation strategy would have social implications. Specifically, suppression involves three social costs. The act of suppressing facial expressions prohibits others in the social world from gaining information about a suppressor's emotional state. This can prevent a suppressor from receiving social emotional benefits such as sympathy or sharing in collective positive and negative emotions that \\"facilitate social bonding\\" (Srivastava et al., 2009, 895). Secondly, expressive suppression is not always fully successful. If a suppressor accidentally shows signs of concealed feelings, others may perceive that the suppressor is covering up true emotions and may assume that the suppressor is insincere and uninterested in forming legitimate social relationships (Srivastava et al., 2009). Lastly, expressive suppression is hard work and therefore requires more cognitive processing than freely communicating emotions. If a suppressor is unable to devote full attention to social interactions because he/she is using cognitive power to suppress, the suppressor will not be able to remain engaged nor put in the work to maintain relationships (Srivastava et al., 2009).

Description Like many Australian funnel-web spider species, both sexes of the Port Macquarie funnel-web spider have a shiny black carapace and dark brown to black legs, chelicerae and abdomen. The carapace is slightly longer than it is wide; in the male averages around 0.97 cm long and 0.91 cm wide, and around 1.1 cm long and 0.93 cm wide in the female. The legs of the male are around long each, and the female around long. The abdomen is around 1.1 cm long in the male and 1.4 cm long in the female. Distribution and habitat The Port Macquarie funnel-web spider is found along the northern coast of New South Wales in eastern Australia, where specimens have been collected from the vicinity of Forster north through Taree, Port Macquarie to Coffs Harbour and Bellingen. Toxicity The Port Macquarie funnel-web spider has been responsible for at least one case of serious envenomation out of six bites that can be attributed to it.

Using this method an IT solution provider performs services as needed and bills the customer only for the work done. The service may include repairs, upgrades or installation of systems, components, peripheral equipment, networking or software. The alternative to break/fix is managed services, which is a service plan, where the customer pays a fixed amount for services covered in the plan and pays additional amounts for repairs or other work which is not covered in the plan. The equivalent practice in the consumer market is that of out-of-warranty appliances, where the customer can pay for repairs as needed (break/fix) or they can buy an extended warranty (managed services). An advantage of break/fix IT management is the initial lower cost of maintenance. However, since problems are only addressed when they arise, maintenance is reactive rather than proactive. Small problems left unaddressed can balloon into major failures due to focus on cost.

During that time it was used by the Bulli Coal Company in the transportation of coal from the Bulli mine to the ships for export to other destinations. D. H. Lawrence who visited Thirroul in 1922 and lived only about 900 meters from the jetty described it as ‚Äúa long, high jetty straddling on great tree-trunk poles out on to the sea, and carrying a long line of little red-coal trucks, the sort that can be tipped up‚Ä¶As a rule the jetty was as deserted as if it were some relic left by an old invader. Then it had spurts of activity, when steamer after steamer came blorting and hanging miserably round, like cows to the cowshed on a winter afternoon. Then a little engine would chuff along the pier, shoving a string of tip-up trucks, and little men would saunter across the sky-line, and there would be a fine dimness of black dust round the low, red ship at the end of the jetty.‚Äù History George Adams, owner of the Jetty and Bulli Mine circa 1890. Bulli Jetty as seen from Sublime Point circa 1900.Collapsed portion of Bulli Jetty in 1907.The line was originally proposed to be built to Bellambi but was revised. The jetty was constructed at Sandon Point in 1863. It was over 200 meters long and was built by William Weaver, an engineer who worked for the Bulli Coal Company. In 1867 much of it was swept away in a storm taking with it the lives of the four men who were working on it at the time. Over the next two decades numerous repairs were made to the jetty after storm damage. In about 1890 it closed for several years. George Adams acquired the Bulli Coal Company in 1894 and commenced reconstruction of the jetty. He added about 30 meters to its length and raised it to allow the safe loading of much larger coal ships. He also installed the electric light on the jetty which was a major advance at that time. Soon after George Adams became the owner of the Bulli mine he built a large house at Sandon Point not far from the jetty which he called ‚ÄúSandon Cottage‚Äù. A photo of the house and jetty are shown below. He lived at the house periodically and occasionally entertained visitors such as parliamentarians there.Aerial view of Bulli Jetty in 1938. In April 1907 after the new jetty had been in operation for over a decade a very strange incident occurred. In perfectly calm weather a large length of the jetty collapsed. The newspaper report said that ‚Äúwithout the slightest warning the centre portion of the jetty suddenly subsided and disappeared into the sea. One of the employees had only half a minute previously stepped onto the higher portion at the sea end of the jetty which was left standing.\\" Two months later the remaining part at the sea end was also destroyed but this time the destruction was caused by a fierce storm. The repairs to the jetty took almost two years to complete. In 1912 more major storm damage occurred to the structure which took some considerable time to repair. In 1943 the jetty was damaged and abandoned with successive storms caused further damage to the pylons. It was used by fishermen but no more mining operations occurred at the site. Bulli Jetty and Sandon Point showing George Adam's house called \\"Sandon Cottage\\" (now demolished) circa 1900. Jetty employees Alexander Spence Artis. One of the first managers of the jetty was Alexander Spence Artis. At the age of 27 he commenced work at the jetty soon after it was opened and remained there until his retirement twenty-four years later. Artis was born in England and became an able seaman and later qualified as a second mate. In 1863 after he arrived in Sydney on the ship Canada West he deserted.New South Wales, Australia, Police Gazette, 1863, p. 278. He married Eliza Lang in Glebe a few months later and they came to Bulli to live. He sought employment on the jetty and eventually he rose to the position of manager. Another notable manager of the Bulli Jetty was James Owers (1862-1939) who came to work here in about 1890. He married Emily Waskett in 1887 and the couple came to Australia. He was employed as an able seaman on the coal ship Woonona. The Woonona included Bulli as one of its routine ports of call. Owers worked on the jetty for over forty years eventually becoming the manager.

There are a number of variations in snap-fits, including cantilever, torsional and annular. Snap-fits, as integral attachment features, are an alternative to assembly using nails or screws, and have the advantages of speed and no loose parts. Snap-fit connectors can be found in everyday products such as battery compartment lids, snap fasteners and pens. History Snap-together connectors have been used for thousands of years. The first ones were metal. Some of the oldest snap-fits found are snap fasteners, or buttons, shown on the Chinese Terracotta Army featuring soldiers from the late Warring States Period. Metal snap fasteners, spring clips, and other snap-type connectors are still in broad use today. With the development of new flexible yet springy materials, such as molded plastic, and new manufacturing processes, many new variations in these types of connectors have been invented, and are commonly called snap-fits. They can be found in on our phones, laptops, keys, and other household devices. Engineers have studied and developed these snap-fits, creating formulae concerning the amount of deflection allowed on the components, amount of torque one can take, and the amount of space one can allow in order to be detached. Production Molds of the parts are created and hot liquid plastic is poured into the molds. The molds contain the shape of the parts and the snapping component built in. However, one major risk when the cooling of the mold finishes is the product shrinking causing errors in the attachment parts. Building a snap-fit design requires more precise engineering than a screw or nail assembly, and is often more expensive. When snap-fits are being made, the producer needs to determine where the stresses of the parts will be applied to when assembled, or they break during assembly. The high production costs are due to the amount of calculation and precision that must be done in order to create a strong snap- fit. Another reason is the creation of molds; they are more time-consuming from the integration of parts in the product. Design Cantilever snap-fit The design of the snap-fit determines what it can be used for. There are three main types of snap-fits: annular, cantilever, and torsional. Most snap-fit joints have a common design of a protruding edge and a snap-in area. The specific name of the snap-fit is usually named after the type of stress or strain it utilizes; the torsional snap-fit uses torque to hold parts in place. Annular The annular snap-fit utilizes hoop-strain to hold into place. Hoop-strain is the expansion of the circumference of the more elastic piece as it is pushed onto the more rigid piece. In most cases the design is circular. Some popular examples are pen caps, ball and socket joints, snap fasteners and some water bottle caps. This kind of snap-fit can be used multiple times. However, permanent strain may develop, loosening the joint when it is used too often. Cantilever The cantilever snap-fit is the most commonly used snap-fit of the three. A cantilever design can be multiple use or permanent. A multiple use snap-fit usually has a lever or pin to be pushed, in order to undo the snap-fit. However, on a permanent snap-fit there is no lever or pin. Attempting to undo a permanent snap-fit can result in the piece breaking. Some potential problems with being able to undo the snap-fit is hyper-extending it past its breaking point. As a solution, some parts have a stopper in order to stop the snap-fit from breaking. One very popular example is a battery compartment lid. Torsional Similarly to Cantilever snap fits, in a torsional snap fit one must deflect, or force the protruding edges of piece B away from the insertion area. Piece A then slides in between the protruding edges until the desired distance is reached. The edges of piece B is then released and piece A is held in place. The snap-fits in this description are the protruding edges of piece B. These types of snap-fits may have a spring in place; so that when activated, the locked in piece is released and put into action.

St. Joan's is a feminist Catholic organization, with a focus on women's equality. It is named after St. Joan of Arc. The organization has played a major role in influencing the ordination of women and general human rights. Their mission is \\"to secure the political, social and economic equality between men and women and to further the work and usefulness of Catholic women as citizens\\". History= The Catholic Women's Suffrage Society  The organization was founded in London, England in 1911 as the \\"Catholic Women's Suffrage Society,\\" with a focus on organizing Catholic women in England to support women's suffrage. = Founding = Prior to the founding of the Catholic Women‚Äôs Suffrage Society, Catholic suffragettes had participated in other suffrage organizations, such as the Women‚Äôs Social and Political Union (WSPU), the Women‚Äôs Freedom League (WFL), and the National Union of Women‚Äôs Suffrage Societies (NUWSS). The roots of the Catholic Women‚Äôs Suffrage Society began when young Catholic suffragettes Gabrielle Jeffery and May Kendall met on December 8, 1910, coincidentally the date of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception. Jeffery and Kendall met while waiting outside Holloway Prison to welcome the release of imprisoned suffragettes, a common practice for the WSPU in England at the time. Jeffery and Kendall developed the idea of creating a Catholic women‚Äôs suffrage organization to bring together Catholics, male and female, to work towards women‚Äôs suffrage. Together with seven other Catholic suffragists, they held their first meeting on March 25, 1911, and created the Catholic Women‚Äôs Suffrage Society. Early members of the CWSS, in addition to Gabrielle Jeffery and May Kendall, included Beatrice Gadsby, Christine O‚ÄôConnor, Smyth Pigott, Monica Whately, and Kathleen Fitzgerald, who was appointed first chairman of the Society. The purpose of the Society was ‚Äúto band together Catholics of both sexes, in order to secure the Parliamentary vote on the same terms as it is, or may be granted to men.\\" The Catholic Women‚Äôs Suffrage Society chose for its colors blue, gold, and white: blue representing Mary the mother of Christ, and gold and white in reference to the papacy of the Catholic church. In addition, the CWSS chose Joan of Arc as their patron. While the CWSS was founded in London, additional branches were later created throughout United Kingdom. The first branch outside of London was founded in 1911 in Hastings in East Sussex. In the next several years, other branches sprung up in Liverpool, Brighton, Plymouth, Cardiff, Manchester, Birmingham, Wakefield, Oxford, and Oldham, as well as some Scottish branches. = Catholicism and Women's Suffrage = The CWSS sought to promote and improve the perception of women‚Äôs suffrage among Catholics in England. Catholic opinion on women‚Äôs suffrage was mixed, among both clergy and laypeople. Early on, the Society sought the approval of prominent Catholic clergy, and also worked with other Catholic organizations. For example, in December of 1911, the CWSS wrote to prominent members of the Catholic clergy, including the Archbishop of Westminster, asking them to consider the social, moral, and religious importance of extending the right to vote to women. Also, starting in 1911, the CWSS started sending representatives to the National Catholic Congress. The CWSS also worked to challenge anti-suffrage sentiments among Catholic clergy. The Reverend Henry Day, for example, opposed women‚Äôs suffrage and denied the equality of men and women, and was often quoted in the press. In response, the members of the CWSS gathered and passed out CWSS leaflets outside the churches where he preached in Manchester and Liverpool, and also denounced Day‚Äôs words by writing to the press. = Activities = Soon after its founding, the Catholic Women‚Äôs Suffrage Society quickly began participating in the women‚Äôs suffrage movement. On June 17, 1911, the CWSS joined with other women‚Äôs suffrage organizations in the Women‚Äôs Coronation Procession. Around eighty members of the CWSS participated in the procession, many representing Catholic societies and wearing religious medals and ribbons. In 1912, the CWSS joined a demonstration of religious suffrage organizations in a demonstration at Trafalgar Square. The CWSS, like other suffrage organizations, adopted a stance on militancy, a controversial and divisive issue for many suffragists. The Society decided to be non-partisan and non- militant, focusing instead on constitutional methods. Militant members were allowed to join, on the condition that their militant actions did not represent the CWSS. While the Society itself remained committed to non- militant actions, they refused to denounce militant suffragettes, and in fact condemned the mistreatment of imprisoned suffragettes, especially the practice of force-feeding suffragettes on hunger strike. Unlike some groups that suspended their direct efforts at suffrage during World War I, the Catholic Women‚Äôs Suffrage Society continued to work towards women‚Äôs suffrage in England. The CWSS‚Äôs Annual Report in 1914 states, ‚Äúit rests with us to see that the position of women is not worse after the war than it was before.‚Äù Beginning in 1915, the CWSS created its own journal, the Catholic Suffragist, first edited by Leonora de Alberti, which openly promoted women‚Äôs suffrage and equal rights. = Post World War I = In 1918, the Representation of the People Act granted suffrage to British women over the age of thirty. In celebration, the CWSS organized a Mass of Thanksgiving at Westminster Cathedral on February 17, 1918. Catholic and non-Catholic suffragists attended, including Millicent Fawcett and Margaret Nevinson. However, while they celebrated the partial suffrage victory, the CWSS continued to work towards full suffrage for all women, and for women‚Äôs rights in general. This included issues such as women‚Äôs representation in national organizations, equal pay for men and women‚Äôs work, and women holding political office. The CWSS also changed the name of its journal from the Catholic Suffragist to the Catholic Citizen. The CWSS also began to focus on international organizations and issues, such as international women‚Äôs suffrage and international Catholicism. In 1920, the CWSS sent delegates to the International Woman Suffrage Alliance in Switzerland. Later that same year, the CWSS met with American and international suffrage leader Carrie Chapman Catt, who stated, ‚Äúpractically the whole world had been won to suffrage with the exception of the Latin Catholic countries,‚Äù and encouraged the members to help Catholic women all over the world.  St. Joan's International Alliance  As of 1923, the organization had members in 5 continents in 24 countries. That year it changed its name to \\"St. Joan's Social and Political Alliance.\\" The organization presented a paper about \\"the Condition of Women,\\" to the League of Nations in 1937. That paper is considered an influence on International matrimonial law. St. Joan's was the first group in Catholicism to work for women priests.http://bridgetmarys.blogspot.com/2011/10/100th-anniversary- celebration-of-st.html The first chapter in Australia was founded in 1946, in New South Wales. Additional Australia chapters started in 1950 and the first Australian conference was held in 1951 in Sydney. Enid Lyons was the Victoria, Australia founding president. The first German chapter was founded in 1950, starting in West Germany with approximately 50 members. In 1952, the organization was placed on consultative status with the United Nations, triggered by the organizations involvement in a discussion with the United Nations about female castration. The organization also became involved in anti-slavery and anti-human trafficking causes. At that time, the United Kingdom founding chapter was known as the Great Britain and Northern Ireland Section of the St Joan's International Alliance. In 1977, The Catholic Citizen was published in English and French. They also publish materials in Spanish. Since 1967, the organization has issued resolutions following women and human rights focused declarations by the Vatican. St. Joan's also influenced the Catholic community in Canada to approve of the ordination of women in 1971. Collections and archives related to the organization are held in the Women's Library. Notable members Notable members included Alaskan lawyer and politician Dorothy Awes Haaland, who served as president of the Alaskan chapter. Anna Maria Dengel, Mary Daly, and Ida Raming were also a members. Bibliography *Daigler, Mary Jeremy.

FAO. jaragua grass, and giant thatching grass. It is native to Africa and it is widespread in the world as a cultivated forage and fodder for livestock and a naturalized and sometimes invasive species. Description This is usually a perennial grass, but it sometimes grows as an annual,Hyparrhenia rufa. Pacific Island Ecosystems at Risk (PIER). and it is variable in form. It usually forms dense tufts of stems from a short rhizome.Heuz√© V., Tran G., Hassoun P., Lebas F., 2015. Jaragua (Hyparrhenia rufa). Feedipedia, a programme by INRA, CIRAD, AFZ and FAO. https://www.feedipedia.org/node/426 Last updated on May 11, 2015, 14:30 The stems can be 30 centimeters to 3.5 meters tall.Barkworth, M. E. Hyparrhenia rufa. Grass Manual. Flora of North America. The leaf sheaths enclose the stem at intervals, making it appear banded. Flowering stems have sparse leaves, but grazing increases leaf production.Hyparrhenia rufa. NatureServe. 2013. The leaf blades are 30 to 60 centimeters long. The panicle is up to 80 centimeters long and is made up of many short, yellowish or red-tinged racemes all subtended by a narrow, reddish spathe a few centimeters long. The racemes are lined with pairs of spikelets, the red-haired fertile spikelets without stalks and the smaller sterile spikelets on stalks. The rough-haired seeds are dispersed in the fur of animals, on the wind, and on vehicles and machinery such as graders. Ecology In its native range the grass grows in woodlands and seasonally flooded grasslands. It is also tolerant of drought and easily naturalizes in disturbed habitat sites. Several species of leafcutter ants have been observed foraging on jaragua, including Atta capiguara and A. laevigata.Nagamoto, N. S., et al. (2009). Differentiation in selection of dicots and grasses by the leaf-cutter ants Atta capiguara, Atta laevigata and Atta sexdens rubropilosa. Sociobiology 54(1), 127-38. The grass is susceptible to the plant pathogenic nematodes Helicotylenchus pseudopaxilli, Pratylenchus brachyurus, and Longidorus laevicapitatus. It can also host the phytoplasma bacterium which causes stunting in Napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum), and its infection has been dubbed Hyparrhenia grass white leaf disease.Obura, E., et al. (2011). Hyparrhenia grass white leaf disease, associated with a 16SrXI phytoplasma, newly reported in Kenya. New Disease Reports 24 17. Feed This grass is grown in pastures for grazing and is cut for fodder, including hay and silage. It is often used for grazing beef cattle, and it is also used to raise dairy cattle, sheep, and goats. It is not a very nutritious grass, so it is generally supplemented with legumes for nitrogen and molasses, citrus pulp, or bran for energy. One experimental supplement for goats is a mix of groundnut cake and wheat bran.Betsha, S. and S. Melaku. (2009). Supplementations of Hyparrhenia rufa-dominated hay with groundnut cake-wheat bran mix: effects on feed intake, digestibility and nitrogen balance of Somali goats. Tropical Animal Health and Production 41(6), 927-33. Legumes that have been added as supplements include Cratylia argentea,Ibrahim, M., et al. (2001). Promoting intake of Cratylia argentea as a dry season supplement for cattle grazing Hyparrhenia rufa in the subhumid tropics. Agroforestry Systems 51(2), 167-75. Erythrina poeppigiana, Gliricidia sepium, and Leucaena leucocephala. The protein content and digestibility of the grass are lowest in the dry season. As a weed As a weed in Hawaii Where it has been introduced into cultivation it has frequently taken hold in the local habitat, sometimes becoming an invasive component of the flora. On the Llanos of South America it has grown easily on the moist grasslands that resemble those of its original range.Simoes, M. and Z. Baruch. (1991). Responses to simulated herbivory and water stress in two tropical C4 grasses. Oecologia 88(2), 173-80. It was introduced to the region to feed animals because native grasses are more fibrous and less nutritious.Baruch, Z. and D. S. Fern√°ndez. (1993). Water relations of native and introduced C4 grasses in a neotropical savanna. Oecologia 96(2), 179-85. Its ability to outcompete native grasses such as Trachypogon plumosus is thought to come from several factors, which may include higher rate of growth, photosynthesis and germination of seeds, more efficient use of water, and more resources channeled into leaf development. It better tolerates loss of foliage to herbivores. It commonly reproduces vegetatively, but it also produces large amounts of highly viable seed. This grass is a pyrophyte, well adapted to habitat with an annual wildfire cycle. During the dry season it becomes very flammable.Johnson, N. C. and D. A. Wedin. (1997). Soil carbon, nutrients, and mycorrhizae during conversion of dry tropical forest to grassland. Ecological Applications 7(1), 171-82. Wildfires in stands of native grasses are patchy and relatively limited. H. rufa forms dense monotypic stands of tall stems in the absence of grazing pressure, and these stands ignite easily, burn intensely, and spread fire into the surrounding forests. Not only does the grass make wildfire events more severe, but it increases in response to fire.D'Antonio, C. M. and P. M. Vitousek. (1992). Biological invasions by exotic grasses, the grass/fire cycle, and global change. Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics 23(1), 63-87. Dry parts may be burned away, but living tissue near the ground is not harmed and resprouts immediately; fire damage to an established stand of the grass is \\"negligible\\". Today this species occurs as a weed in most tropical regions. It can be found in North, Central, and South America, many Pacific Islands, Asia, parts of Africa outside its native range, and Australia. Other uses This tall grass can be used as thatching, as straw, and as pulp for making paper. In East Africa it is planted as a border grass to prevent erosion.

Sexual harassment On 27 June's night, a 31-year- old female named Eylem K., who attended the night's protests in Ankara, was taken into custody by riot police with 10 other people, including a boy under 18. On 28 June, in front of the Ankara Courthouse, she reported that she was subject to violence, sexual harassment and torture in the police car where she was detained. She also stated that she was threatened with rape and torture continued for almost 2 hours in 2 different cars.S√∂zc√º, 3 July 2013, p.10, Left-side. Deaths of animals Police gas and blast bombs killed many animals as well. Stray dogs, cats and birds in particular have died of heart attacks or gas poisoning. Acclaimed Turkish director Zeki Demirkubuz tweeted that \\"I have seen birds falling off the trees because of the gas.\\" There were mobile animal hospitals in and around Gezi Park during the protests, but after protests many veterinaries refrained to give testimonies. Freedom to Earth Association has noted this self-censor when it attempted to gather different testimonies and photo evidences for injured and killed animals. On 28 September, after exactly four months since protests sparked, the association called for a commemoration for all living beings murdered by Turkish police during the riots. Different groups have attended such as LGBT organizations, anticapitalist Muslims, anarchist block and PEN-International Turkey. However Turkish police have barred this mass to read their press statement, collected ID's from anyone, pushed people with their shields and arrested ones who resisted. After 13 arrests, remaining group have made their rally, read their statement which announced that Turkish state is being taken to Court of Justice for Animal Rights. The complaint was filed with the Court shortly thereafter.

First unveiled by the company on October 27, 2013 for a release in South Korea, and carrying similarities to its G2 model, the smartphone is the company's first to incorporate a flexible display, along with a \\"self-healing\\" rear cover which can repair minor abrasions on its own. The G Flex was met with mixed reviews by critics, who characterized the device as a proof of concept for bleeding edge flexible screen technology rather than a device targeted towards the mass market. While the G Flex was praised for its durability, performance and the visibility of its screen, it was panned for being too similar in hardware, software, and design to the G2, having a low-resolution display that suffered from noise and image retention issues, and for presenting no compelling justification for the curved display in relation to the device's high price. It was succeeded by the LG G Flex 2 in January 2015. History In May 2013, LG announced that it would unveil prototypes for two OLED flexible displays at an exhibition organized by the Society for Information Display; a 55-inch television, and a 5-inch \\"unbreakable\\" display meant for mobile devices. In October 2013, rumors from a \\"person familiar with the company's launch plans\\" suggested that LG was planning to release a phablet with a curved, 6-inch OLED display known as the \\"G Flex\\". On October 27, 2013, LG officially unveiled the G Flex for a release in South Korea in November 2013, and later announced releases in Europe and the rest of Asia. Although LG had yet to confirm a North American release, a variant supporting United States carriers' networks was approved by the Federal Communications Commission in November 2013. At Consumer Electronics Show in January 2014, LG announced a U.S. release for the G2 across several major carriers. In March 2014, LG released an advertisement online to promote the G Flex, which portrayed the device as being \\"the most human phone ever\\" by representing a caller as a talking, bearded mouth on the user's hand, complete with an ear on the finger as an earpiece. The user is also seen feeding the mouth cake, and when phoning a woman later in the ad, kissing it. The ad was met with attention from media outlets, who considered it to be bizarre, with a TechCrunch writer going as far as dubbing it the worst commercial for a smartphone ever, and Kate Hutchington of The Guardian declaring it \\"more disturbing than the act of taking your mum to see Nymphomaniac on Mother's Day.\\"  Specifications  The G Flex's physical design resembles that of the LG G2, consisting of a polycarbonate shell with a curvature of 700 millimetres (28 in), with volume and power buttons located on the rear of the device directly below the camera‚Äîthe power button also contains an LED lamp which can be used as a notification light. The rear casing of the G Flex carries a \\"brushed metal\\" look and features a \\"self-healing\\" coating which can repair minor scratches and abrasions made to it. LG claimed that the curved design would be more \\"natural\\" when held to the head for conducting phone calls, and would reduce the level of glare on the display. While the phone can withstand being bent‚Äîhaving been being bent a hundred times with 88 pounds (40 kg) of pressure during internal testing without any permanent damage to its form, LG chose to maintain a level of rigidity to the G Flex's design in order to ensure a \\"premium\\" feel. The G Flex's internal hardware is almost identical to the G2, with a 2.26 GHz quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor with 2 GB of RAM, support for LTE or LTE Advanced networks where available, 32 GB of internal storage, and an infrared emitter. Unlike the G2, however, the G Flex's display is a 6-inch (15 cm), 720p, flexible OLED display coated with Gorilla Glass, and it also incorporates a non-removable 3500 mAh battery specifically optimized for the G Flex's curved form factor - it curves around the frame to fill any empty space; LG claims it's the world‚Äôs first curved battery.https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/lg-g-flex  Software  The G Flex ships with Android 4.2.2 \\"Jelly Bean\\" with a similar user interface and software to the G2. Several minor new features were added, including a \\"dual- window\\" split-screen multitasking mode, and alongside the G2's existing optimization options for one-handed use, the ability to slide all of the on- screen navigation keys to one side of the screen. Aside from the lack of optical image stabilization (which was excluded because it would make the image sensor too tall for the device's body), the G Flex's 13-megapixel camera is similar to the G2, with the addition of a new \\"Face Tracking\\" shooting mode to assist users in taking photos containing themselves with the rear-facing camera, which automatically focuses on the user's face, and uses the power button's notification LED as a status light. In March 2014, LG began rolling out an update to Android 4.4.2 \\"KitKat\\". Along with other improvements, the update adds \\"Knock Code\\", a security feature introduced by the LG G Pro 2 which allows users to unlock their device by tapping certain quadrants of the screen in a sequence. The LG G Flex will not officially be updated to Android 5.0 \\"Lollipop\\".  Reception  The G Flex was released to mixed reviews. The design of the G Flex was praised for its durability and bendability, with Engadget reporting that they \\"did plenty of pushing and pulling on the device to test its physical limits, and none of our efforts resulted in cracking or any kind of damage to the chassis.\\" However, The Verge felt that the \\"self- healing\\" rear cover was not effective enough after it was unable to recover from a scratch from a key, comparing it to Wolverine only being able to heal from paper cuts. The design of the phone itself was panned for being lackluster, and for being too similar to the G2. Although it was praised for its performance and battery life, the G Flex's hardware and software were also panned for being too similar to the G2, with its software in particular being criticized for not containing any features specifically intended to take advantage of the curved screen (besides the lock screen wallpaper tilting along with the phone), and for the removal of optical image stabilization from the camera. The G Flex's curved display was praised for having good viewing angles and brightness levels, and as promised, having a lower level of glare than most smartphones. However, the display was criticized for having a significantly lower resolution than other flagship phones and a grainy appearance, while Ars Technica also noticed issues with image retention and uneven lighting on screen contents. LG's decision to introduce its flexible display on an abnormally large phone was also noted; in response to LG billing the display as having a more \\"immersive\\" viewing experience for movies, The Verge felt that \\"it's [immersive] due to the sheer size of the display. And I don't care what it's made of: a 6-inch smartphone is never going to feel comfortable on my face while I make a phone call.\\". Engadget ultimately gave the G Flex an 83 out of 100, noting that the device was \\"a cross between a status symbol and a proof of concept [in some respects]\\", but contending that the device was too expensive (costing about US$940 upfront) and recommended that consumers wait for options with more \\"reasonable\\" prices before considering to buy a curved smartphone. The Verge gave the G Flex a 7 out of 10, arguing that given its high price, there was nothing \\"compelling\\" about the curved screen as used by the G Flex, and that it \\"[felt] like a tech demo, an R&D; prototype that was accidentally swapped in a shipping crate with the G2. LG just decided to roll with it, put the G Flex on sale, and see what happens.\\"  References  External links  * G Flex Category:Mobile phones introduced in 2013 Category:Discontinued smartphones Category:Smartphones Category:Android (operating system) devices Category:Phablets ","title":"LG G Flex"},{"id":"40968073","text":"Verdigris Technologies is a venture-backed artificial intelligence technology start-up founded in 2011 by Mark Chung, Thomas Chung, and Jonathan Chu, headquartered in the historic NASA Ames Research Center in the heart of Silicon Valley. Verdigris is an AI-powered, IIoT cleantech platform for energy management in commercial and industrial smart buildings. Verdigris' award- winning technology combines proprietary hardware, AI, and software applications to deliver insights about building operations and enable energy savings. In 2017, Fast Company named Verdigris one of the world's 10 Most Innovative Companies in Energy. Based on the concepts of Nonintrusive load monitoring, the Verdigris energy platform is able to monitor every electrical device in a building by means of the electrical feeds coming off of the building's circuit panel. Verdigris provides data, actionable insights, and automation to help commercial facilities managers increase the energy efficiency of their buildings. Areas that Verdigris works to impact include: reducing power usage during peak hours; identifying motor problems that could be using excess energy; and detecting equipment faults before they occur. Verdigris' customers include hotels, corporate offices, agriculture and food producers, and manufacturers. Early customers included the City of San Jose, Autodesk, and Netflix. Today, Verdigris has over 500 systems deployed across the Americas, Europe, Middle East, Africa, and Asia. Notable customers listed on their website include: Jabil Circuit, Hyatt Hotels, ARM, ABB, Nvidia, Schneider, The W Hotel San Francisco (Starwood Hotels), The Orchard Hotel in San Francisco, and The Marriott Marquis in Washington, DC. To date, Verdigris has raised about $15 million in venture funding. Verdigris raised $6.7 million in an October 2016 venture capital round that was led by contract manufacturer Jabil as well as Verizon Ventures.  Products  The Verdigris platform consists of patented hardware, software, and AI algorithms and is offered to the market through the following product categories:  Energy Metering & Analytics  The 5th generation of the Verdigris hardware product was formally launched on August 30, 2016 with a live demo at the Jabil Blue Sky Center in San Jose, California. According to Engineering.com, ‚Äú[this generation] differs from their previous hardware because it is more straightforward to install, and it has an integrated cellular radio. Previous equipment from the company required an attachment to an external data connectivity system.‚Äù According to the company's website, the hardware takes 30‚Äì120 minutes to install and the connectivity is provided via 4G/LTE through a partnership with Verizon Wireless.  Automation  In addition to hardware and energy intelligence software, the company has also moved into automated building optimization through automated demand management. The company's Adaptive Automation product uses energy data gathered from the hardware combined with historical usage trends and weather data to predict future usage, and an algorithm enacts controls in the building to adjust usage in a way that reduces energy consumption and costs. The company cites one customer, Grand Hyatt San Francisco, that was able to save 20% of the controlled load and earn a 40% ROI.  Forecasting & Alerts  In 2019, Verdigris announced a partnership with the multinational electrification company ABB to offer its machine learning algorithms to ABB customers. \\"The Energy Forecasting app will enable users to reduce their electricity bills by reducing peak demand charges. The Intelligent Alerts app uses machine learning algorithms to help customers better manage their assets, identifying underlying issues before they become problems.\\"  API  Verdigris offers an API that enables customers to integrate energy data into enterprise databases or other building energy management systems or data analysis tools.  Services  ‚ÄúWe provide analytics and workflow automation to 24/7 facilities teams to improve operational efficiency, reduce equipment downtimes, and save on energy, delivered as a SaaS,‚Äù said co-founder Thomas Chung to TechCrunch in March 2016. Verdigris smart sensors clamp onto electrical circuits to track a building's energy consumption and sends the data securely over Wi-Fi or Verizon 4G/LTE to the cloud. Verdigris claims that its patented sensors track energy through an always-on AI that consumes more detailed information than any other solution. Its sensors take hundreds of millions more data points than utility smart meters every hour. This enables Verdigris AI technology and algorithms to ‚Äúlearn‚Äù a building's equipment over time. It tracks energy output down to the microsecond and has equipment-level data. Verdigris forecasting for demand management uses a deep learning recurrent neural network model. It reads a building's energy usage in real time, and, combined with weather or building occupancy, produces a probability distribution for estimated power consumption (kW). The Verdigris system is certified for use in 38 countries including the United States, the European Union (32 countries), China, Malaysia, Mexico, India, Canada. Company history Verdigris co-founder and CEO Mark Chung came up with the idea for Verdigris when he returned home from vacation to a massive electricity bill. The local utility could not provide Chung with an itemized utility bill to show where he spent the extra electricity. Chung bought inexpensive kilowatt meters, hacked them to be wi-fi enabled, and built an electrical map to monitor every appliance in his house. He found the problem, a broken pool pump, and thought of a business idea to map commercial buildings that use a lot of energy. Verdigris participated in the Stanford accelerator, StartX, and as one of the StartX Notable Companies was invested in by Stanford University. Verdigris was also one of the 10 inaugural winners of the Founder.org competition and invested in by Founder.org Capital. NASA was also an early backer of Verdigris, and the two organizations have collaborated on projects including the Sustainability Base at Ames Research Center with the ultimate goal of providing energy intelligence and management to space habitats. Verdigris is headquartered at the NASA Ames Research Park in Moffett Federal Airfield in Mountain View, California. In December 2016, GreenBiz called Verdigris one of the ten companies to watch in the area of smart buildings. CBInsights named Verdigris to the 2017 AI 100 list, recognizing the 100 most promising private artificial intelligence companies globally. In 2017, Fast Company named Verdigris one of the 10 Most Innovative Companies in Energy.  Name  The name ‚ÄòVerdigris‚Äô references the green patina that forms on copper oxidized by exposure to water and air. Copper is used to make electrical wiring and components for the production and distribution of electricity. ‚ÄúCopper is the elemental infrastructure of every single building in the world, what all of our electricity runs on,‚Äù said Chung. ‚ÄúAnd what we have as a company mission is this desire to expose that to the world and make it green.\\"  Awards & Recognition  Verdigris has won numerous awards for its technology and has been featured in several leading news outlets. # PRI: A Silicon Valley engineer is on a quest to green the world by making buildings smarter # KQED: California Startup Saves Companies Millions and Combats Climate Change # CBInsights: AI 100: The Artificial Intelligence Startups Redefining Industries # Fortune: Here are 50 Companies Leading the AI Revolution # GreenBiz: How Internet of things startup Verdigris gives buildings a voice # Engineering.com: Space Age IoT Technology for Energy Management and Fault Prediction # Environmental Leader: How Effective IoT Strategies Can Save Energy # Fast Company: Top 10 Most Innovative Companies in Energy # Frost & Sullivan: 2018 New Product Innovation Award in Energy Management # EPRI Journal: Buildings with Brains, Billions in Savings # McRock Capital: IIoT Entrepreneur of the Year Award  References  External links  * Verdigris homepage * Verdigris on LinkedIn * NASA Ames Research Partners * Verdigris Joins Building Monitor Disaggregator Fray, Inks PG&E; Agreement - greentechmedia.com Category:Software companies established in 2010 Category:Software companies based in the San Francisco Bay Area Category:Software companies of the United States Category:American companies established in 2010 ","title":"Verdigris Technologies"},{"id":"40968084","text":"Gert-Johan Coetzee Gert-Johan Coetzee (born 18 November 1987), is a South African fashion designer. His fashion atelier is based in Linden, Johannesburg in Gauteng province. He specialises in couture red carpet gowns, he also designs ready-to-wear range . Coetzee is known for dressing South African and international celebrities at red-carpet events.  Early life and education  Coetzee was born in Koster, North West Province. His love for fashion started at a very early age, and when he was in Grade Two he told his mother that one day he was going to be a famous fashion designer. He attended Koster primary school until Grade Four and then was home-schooled. As a young boy in school he used to dress his pencils up in tissue paper and by the age of sixteen he started studying at the North West School of Design. He graduated from NWSD in 2005.  Career and the Gert-Johan Coetzee label  During Coetzee's second year at college (2004) he won the High Fashion Award at the annual Vukani Awards. This is where he was spotted by the television personality Sandy Ngema. He dressed her for the red carpet at the Durban July Handicap premier horseracing event that year and also went on to dress her for two seasons as presenter of the SABC3 reality TV series Strictly Come Dancing. In 2006, at the young age of 19, Coetzee was named South Africa's Most Promising Designer at the Cape Town Fashion festival. His first commercial venture was as partner in the Diamond Face Couture label with businesswoman Uyanda Mbuli which launched in 2006. He went on his own in 2010 and launched Gert-Johan Coetzee Pty Ltd at the age of 22. He has since shown his collections at South Africa Fashion week as well as showcasing his work at international Fashion Week shows in Canada at Vancouver Fashion Week, Angola and Nigeria. His couture designs are worn at all major fashion events including the Durban July Handicap, J&B; Met, SA Music Awards, Huisgenoot Skouspel, You Spectacular and Miss World. His gowns have been worn by presenters of popular TV shows such as Strictly Come Dancing and Top Billing. Just a year into establishing his own label Coetzee achieved a celebrity coup when international TV stars Kourteney Kardashian (Keeping Up with the Kardashians). and Kristin Cavallari (The Hills) wore GJC dresses on the Hollywood red carpet. He subsequently also dressed soap opera star Arianna Zucker (Days of Our Lives) in 2012, and Kelly Rowland, (in 2013, at the 40th anniversary of the Ms Foundation for Women in Beverly Hills, in honour of its founder Gloria Steinem. Coetzee has a long list of high-end clients and celebrities including such notable figures as Revlon Ambassador Bonang Matheba, Pabi Moloi, Tamara Dey, Lira, Liezel van der Westhuizen, Cindy Nell, Terry Pheto, Tatum Keshwar, Kerry McGregor, Louise Carver, Doreen Morris as well as several influential women in politics and African royalty.gertjohancoetzee.com, 2013 Coetzee is also the first South African Swarovski brand ambassador. Coetzee is interested in technological advances in fashion and constantly pushes the envelope in his collections. In April 2013 he was the first South African fashion designer to utilise hi-tech 3D-printing technology in his SA Fashion Week Spring Summer 2013 \\"sea urchin\\" collection. He collaborated with the Vaal University of Technology on the technical side, to render and print three-dimensional embellishments to incorporate into the garments. Then in October 2013, at the next SA Fashion Week, he looked to new technologies again and collaborated with photographer Nicole Phillips to captured his all-pink Autumn Winter 2014 collection with never-before seen in South Africa time-slice fashion photography on an intricate set using 40 cameras firing simultaneously.  Social consciousness  Coetzee believes in \\"fashion with a conscience\\" and is known for using his platform and voice as a celebrity designer in the media to bring attention to social issues, mainly concentrating on women. Coetzee first launched this concept in September 2012 when he met Thando Hopa, a prosecutor with the National Prosecuting Authority, who has albinism and whom he convinced to become the face of his new collection. Hopa had never modelled before but her appearance on the catwalk at SA Fashion Week in GJC caused a stir in the fashion industry. In the process GJC and Hopa raised awareness of the plight of people with albinism who still face superstition and discrimination in Africa. The partnership between GJC and Thando Hopa endures and she has since become a spokesperson for people with albinism. In April 2013 Coetzee partnered up with Shout, the South African anticrime organisation and dedicated his Spring/Summer 2013 \\"sea urchin\\" collection to women victims of violence, in protest against the high levels of violence against women in SA society. Inspired by the protective, dangerous spines of the fragile sea urchin, he created 3D-printed spikes which embellished his garments symbolising armour-like wearable protection for women. Then for his \\"all pink\\" Auntumn/Winter 2014 SA Fashion week collection he dedicated it to breast cancer awareness. For this collection, Gert-Johan Coetzee partnered up with the organisation The Pink Drive, which is a mobile organisation that brings breast cancer awareness to the public and testing facilities via trucks with built in equipment. The message he wished to convey through this couture range is \\"take charge of yourself\\".

She has been a professor at UCSC since 1993, chaired the department from 2006 until 2009 and is currently the chair again. In December 2004, Stephens committed to doing seven years of art projects about love with her wife and art collaborator, Annie Sprinkle. They call this their Love Art Laboratory. Part of their project was to do an experimental art wedding each year, and each year had a different theme and color. The seven-year structure was adapted to their project by invitation of artist Linda M. Montano. Sprinkle and Stephens have done seventeen art weddings, fourteen with ecosexual themes. Critics relate the project to contemporary political debates including marriage equality, ecofeminism, and the environmental movement. Critics also note that Stephens' work explores and challenges the validity of the boundary between what is \\"art,\\" and what is \\"pornography.\\" Starting with their 2008 performance wedding to the Earth, Stephens and her partner Annie Sprinkle became pioneers of ecosexuality, a kind of earth-loving sexual identity, which states, ‚ÄúThe Earth is our lover.‚Äù Their Ecosex Manifesto proclaims that anyone can identify as an Ecosexual along with being ‚ÄúGLBTQI, heterosexual, asexual, and/or Other.‚Äù Most recently Stephens has produced and directed two feature documentary films with Annie Sprinkle: Water Makes Us Wet: An Ecosexual Adventure (2017) and Goodbye Gauley Mountain: An Ecosexual Love Story (2013), a film addressing Mountaintop removal mining near her birthplace and its effects on the environment and nearby communities. Her work has been shown internationally, including at Museum Kunstpalast (D√ºsseldorf), El Ojo Atomico Antimuseo de Arte Contempor√°neo (Spain), Museo Reina Sophia (Madrid), the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, 53rd Venice Biennale, and Documenta 14. In 2017, Stephens and her wife/collaborator Annie Sprinkle were official artists in Documenta 14. They presented performances and visual art, lectured, and previewed their new film documentary, Water Makes Us Wet: An Ecosexual Adventure.

In 2012, Tay was conferred a fellowship from the Singapore Institute of Arbitrators. Political career After getting his master's degree, Tay became an advocate and solicitor for the Supreme Court of Singapore as well as an associate mediator for the Singapore Mediation Centre. He attended Harvard University's six-week Advanced Management Programme in 2014. From 1995 to 2002, Tay worked at the Singapore Police Force. At the time when he left the force, he held the appointment of Commanding Officer of the Special Tactics and Rescue Unit.

Winter-Irving was the third son of the late John Winter, of Lauder, Berwickshire, Scotland, who brought his family to Victoria (Australia) in 1841, and ultimately settled in Lauderdale, Ballarat, by his marriage with Janet Margaret Irving, of Bonshaw, Scotland. He was educated at the Scotch College, Melbourne, and was brought up to pastoral pursuits, in which his father achieved very great success. In 1857 he, with his brothers, purchased Colbinabbin and other stations in the Rodney district at a cost of about ¬£200,000; and in 1868, on a friendly dissolution of partnership, the Stanhope estate fell to his share. In 1874, in conjunction with J. Ettershank, of East Loddon, Winter visited England and successfully conducted the appeal to the Privy Council against the Crown, relative to the five shilling per acre penalty sought to be enforced against the holders of certificated lands. Mr. Winter was for some years a member of the Waranga Shire Council, being twice president, and was appointed a territorial magistrate in 1868. In 1868 Winter married the only daughter of William Drayton Taylor, J.P., of Noorilim, Goulburn. In 1871 Winter stood for the Eastern Province against Sir Francis Murphy, but ultimately retired in that gentleman's favour. In 1884, on the death of Sir William Mitchell, President of the Legislative Council, he was returned unopposed for the Northern Province; Winter held this seat until death. In 1890 Winter assumed his mother's surname in addition to and in conjunction with his patronymic. His brother, James Winter, of Toolamba, Murchison, who died at Norwood, near London, in 1886, was also a well-known pastoralist.

G. Wells, is at once a satirical portrait of late-Victorian and Edwardian England, a critique of the English educational system on the eve of World War I, a study of the impact of that war on English society, and a general reflection on the purposes of education. Wells regarded it as \\"one of the most ambitious\\" of his novels.David C. Smith, H.G. Wells: Desperately Mortal: A Biography (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1986), p. 248. Plot The novel begins in 1893 with the birth of Peter Stublands, but the first three chapters are devoted to the lives of his parents. Peter's father, Arthur, is one of the heirs of a wealthy family of Quaker manufacturers from the West of England. His mother Dolly is the daughter of a vicar from a well-off family, but being intellectually inclined, she has \\"read herself out of the great Anglican culture.\\"H.G. Wells, Joan and Peter, Ch. 2, ¬ß1 (London: Ernest Benn, 1929), p. 17. Arthur, artistically inclined but not especially gifted, is a devotee of the Arts and Crafts movement and a Fabian socialist. Dolly meets him and falls in love with him while she is studying \\"in the Huxley days as a free student at the Royal College of Science.\\"H.G. Wells, Joan and Peter, Ch. 1, ¬ß3 (London: Ernest Benn, 1929), p. 11. From 1884 to 1887, Wells studied at this institution; it was known as the Normal School of Science until 1890. Arthur designs a house near Limpsfield called the Ingle-Nook, where they live, and where Peter is born. Arthur has two sisters with advanced ideas, Aunt Phyllis and Aunt Phoebe, who are regular visitors. Dolly, however, has retained strong feelings for a cousin who joined the navy, Oswald Sydenham, whose face is badly scarred from the bombardment of Alexandria, and is devoting his career to extending the British Empire in Africa. When Arthur's free-thinking goes so far as to make him unfaithful to Dolly, it is strongly implied that Oswald and Dolly fall in love, but Dolly eventually rejects Oswald's passionate appeal to defy convention and live with him in Central Africa. Dejected, Oswald returns to Africa. The reconciliation of Dolly and Arthur has a tragic consequence, however: on a trip meant to celebrate the overcoming of their differences, Arthur's recklessness with an amateur boatman causes them to drown off Capri. In their wills, Dolly and Arthur had named Oswald as the guardian of their son; because of Dolly's leanings toward Oswald, Arthur changed his will before he died to replace him with three other guardians: Aunts Phoebe and Phyllis, on his side, and Lady Charlotte Sydenham on Dolly's, having assumed that she was a dignified, tolerable woman. The family solicitor, Mr. Sycamore, sends Oswald a letter telling him that, due to the lack of information, he has had to generalize and state that Dolly drowned before Arthur, therefore validating his will. This generalization results in an extended battle over the education of Peter and also of Joan, a child of Dolly's brother born out of wedlock and entrusted to them. Phoebe and Phyllis are eccentrics devoted to the suffragette cause and undertake their guardianship with enthusiasm, but Lady Charlotte, \\"one of those large, ignorant, ruthless, Low-Church, wealthy, and well-born ladies who did so much to make England what it was in the days before the Great War,\\"H.G. Wells, Joan and Peter, Ch. 5, ¬ß1 (London: Ernest Benn, 1929), p. 65. abhors their values. She schemes to christen Joan and Peter, then plots to remove the children from the faddish \\"School of St. George and the Venerable Bede,\\" based on the ideas of Froebel and Ruskin, in order to educate them more traditionally. With the assistance of her solicitor, Lady Charlotte kidnaps the children; Peter is placed in the High Cross Preparatory School, located near Windsor Castle, and Joan finds herself at the mercy of an evil-spirited Mrs. Pybus, the sister of Lady Charlotte's maid. Peter is bullied and mistreated by fellow-students and teachers alike, and runs away after being unjustly punished; Joan falls ill with measles. Oswald returns to England after having \\"given nearly eighteen years to East and Central Africa,\\"H.G. Wells, Joan and Peter, Ch. 9, ¬ß2 (London: Ernest Benn, 1929), p. 168. especially Uganda. It is 1903, and his health has forced him to return to England, determined to devote himself to the education of his wards. The battle over control of the children's education ends when witnesses prove that Dolly perished after Arthur. As a result, her will prevails. Oswald becomes sole guardian of Joan and Peter and undertakes to find them the best education possible. He is disappointed to learn that there are no schools adapted to the needs of the time. Ultimately, he sends Peter to White Court and Joan to Highmorton School. Peter later attends Caxton, and Oswald moves to a home at Pelham Ford, in Ware, Hertfordshire. A lady named Mrs. Moxton keeps house. Chapter 11, \\"Adolescence,\\" is the longest of the novel, and analyzes in some detail the growth to maturity of Joan and Peter. That they have grown up as brother and sister delays the realization that they love each other; indeed, for much of their adolescence they are deeply at odds with one another, especially about their friends. But when Joan accidentally learns through a friend and Aunt Phyllis that her family is largely unrelated to Peter, deeper feelings re-emerge. Joan and Peter are now both students at Cambridge. The Great War begins, and all the men of their acquaintance enlist. Oswald is invalided; most of Joan's lovers are killed in various ways; Peter joins the Royal Flying Corps. He is nearly killed in combat, and as he recovers from serious wounds that he becomes more enlightened about life. It is while he is on leave back in England that Joan tells Peter she loves him. They marry. Peter is again badly wounded when the observation balloon in which he is serving is shot down. But he is out of the war, and looks forward to working toward a future World State. Characters Joan and Peter contain a generous number of characters, who are all connected to in some way to the protagonists and are therefore more-or-less essential to the plot. Parents and their family Presented in order of importance. Dolly Sydenham was the mother of Peter. Arthur Stubland was the father of Peter. William Sydenham was the father of Joan; through Huntley (see below), Joan learns that he was also a poet. He eventually died in a motoring accident. Fanny Dibenham was the mother of Joan; through Aunt Phyllis, Joan learns that she died soon after giving birth to her. Oswald Sydenham is the cousin of Dolly and the guardians of Joan and Peter. Aunts Phyllis and Phoebe are Arthur's sisters and Joan and Peter's guardians for about six years; of the two, Phoebe has the more radical ideas. She writes books and poems under the persona of a stitch-woman, is a suffragette, and Lady Charlotte, as well as being disgusted by their smoking cigarettes, suspects that she does not wear stays. Oswald is unsettled at her habit of leaving shocking books around the house. During the Great War, she starts sleepwalking (much to her sister's distress) and plans to write an \\"Open Letter to German Women\\". Aunt Phyllis is calmer, and she takes a motherly attitude to Joan. Scholarly Acquaintances Presented in order of death; if alive, in order of their being last mentioned. Pupils at the High Cross Preparatory School are unincluded - they do not voluntarily meet after Oswald becomes the children's guardians. For them, see \\"Other\\". Troop was a friend of the two protagonists. He is an American who insists on calling Joan \\"Kid\\" and playing tennis by the rules, much to her and Peter's annoyance. He enlists six days before Peter; his fate is unknown. Winterbaum was a friend of the two protagonists. During their years at the School of St. George and the Venerable Bede, he and Peter were briefly rivals. They re-unite at Cambridge, during a tea-party arranged by Bunny Cuspard (see below); he tells Joan that he admires cubism. He prides in taking Joan out to clubs; when he is in the army, he also wears fopperies but, in his \\"heroic\\" letters to Joan, he admits that he does not want to go any further to \\"the Contago peerage\\". He dies mysteriously in the Battle of Loos, and is the first of their circle of acquaintance to be killed during the Great War. Wilmington was a friend of the two protagonists, particularly of Joan. He was a friend of Peter's at White Court, but when he takes him home to meet Joan, he falls in love with her immediately. Of all of her acquaintances, he loves her the most passionately, and meeting her before he dies, he realizes and tells her that she is always thinking of Peter when she's with him, and that he doubts Peter's faithfulness with her. During a Christmas ball-party, they particularly enjoy themselves: she creates an illusion that he can dance, and before he plays the Kreutzer Sonata to her she kisses him. He enlists as a gunner during the Great War, and soon he sends her lecture-length letters on the stupidity on the army. One day, he was setting up some six-inch guns and is moved against his will to what he knows is an inferior place, and is killed by a German bomb whilst making a gun-pit. Bunny Cuspard was a friend of the two protagonists. Somewhat eccentric but light-hearted, he cannot take life particularly seriously, and during his time at Cambridge, he organizes \\"First Wednesday of the Month\\" tea- parties. At the start of the Great War, he struggles between being a conscientious objector or enlisting; he eventually becomes a soldier and resolves to simply shout and disarm the Germans. He is particularly haunted by two gruesome incidents he hears of in the army, hence his resolve. He and his regiment are sent to Ireland, and is shot fatally around the chest by a Sinn F√©in sniper; interested in the drunken spinning of his legs and thinking that he has invented a new sort of dance (\\"the backwards-step\\"), he dies laughing. It is briefly mentioned that he has a copy of Little Wars, a games-manual written by Wells. Mir Jellaludin is a friend of the two protagonists. An Indian, he is a Muslim, but says that he is interested in every other faith. He meets Joan at a meeting, where she lectures on Buddhist principles; he eventually starts sending her books, poetry, and flowers. Peter is prejudiced against him at first meeting, but changes his mind when he visits him in hospital and he realizes that he saved his life in his dogfight. Jellaludin is severely disappointed that the British Army do not take on Indians as pilots, and is therefore working in the French Air Force. The Sheldrick circle are an eccentric family who attended the School of St. George and the Venerable Bede. Their costume-parties inspire Miss Murgatroyd (see below) and Joan's dancing skills; one of their games are mentioned to be exciting. During the Great War, however, they take a pacifist stance and shelter Huntley; a dreamer, he was once one of Joan's lovers and reveals to her who her father was, but after she emotionally wounds him by telling him to enlist rather than visit him in Cornwall, he starts writing and spreading pacifist pamphlets; it is implied that he falls in love with one of the daughters, Babs, who is an actress. Other Presented in order of appearance. The unnamed Italian boatman in Capri; he tells Arthur and Dolly Stublands that because he was a stonemason, his lungs became unhealthy and he therefore went to Italy. His inexperience at boating and being easily goaded by Arthur causes them all to drown. Mary was the nurse of Joan and Peter. Once Oswald takes responsibility of the children, she subtly disappears from the story-line. Mr. Sycamore is the family lawyer of Aunts Phyllis and Phoebe. Muir is Oswald's trusted companion-explorer during his life in Africa; when it is verified that he can no longer return, Muir sends the rest of his possessions to England. Miss Murgatroyd is the founder and a teacher at the School of St. George and the Venerable Bede. She stages plays with the help of the Sheldrick circle (see below), and bases her school on Pre-Raphaelite and aesthetic principles. John William Waterhouse and Walter Crane are two of the artists mentioned in her school. Miss Mill is a teacher at the School of St. George and the Venerable Bede. She is trying to get a diploma at a London university, but she is incompetent at mathematics and literacy. Unwin is the maid of Lady Charlotte, with whom the latter hypocritically has conversations with. She provides her with most of her \\"good\\" ideas; her sister, Mrs. Pybus, takes care of Joan when they send Peter to the High Cross Preparatory School. Mr. Grimes is the lawyer of Lady Charlotte Sydenham. Probyn was a pupil at the High Cross Preparatory School. He is the first to take an interest in Peter, but involuntarily causes him to be bullied by his yes-man, Newton. He enlists during the Great War as a bomb- slinger - his shocking appearance (long hair and painted face) and recklessness allows him to be worshipped by his fellow soldiers and feared by the Germans. He and two other Germans are eventually killed by the latter's machine-gun after he carelessly leads the enemy to English trenches. Newton is a pupil at the High Cross Preparatory School. He bullies Peter; his fate during the Great War is unknown. Ames is a pupil at the High Cross Preparatory School. He enlists during the Great War as a soldier, but loses the lower half of his leg after a month of service; when he meets Peter on the boat to England on the latter's first leave after his dogfight, he informs him that Probyn (see below) was killed as a bomb-slinger. Mr. Mainwaring is the cruel headmaster of the High Cross Preparatory School. He, along with two other teachers, are incompetent teachers and make life difficult for Peter. He instructs that the students write falsely-enthusiastic letters to their guardians, and inflict severe punishments on misbehavior. When Peter escapes, he lets loose a sailing-boat and leaves his hat on it, making them believe that he has drowned. Mr. Mackinder is an apologetic schoolmaster. Oswald meets him, in the hope of sending one of the children to his school, and is moved by his conversation on the futility of changing the school system to reflect current affairs. Themes Joan and Peter develops a number of characteristically Wellsian themes. The Unity of Humanity and Its Relation to the Universe Joan and Peter concludes with an extended meditation by Oswald Sydenham in which he poses the problem of a collective human will, a notion that Wells would make one of the central themes of his history of humanity, The Outline of History.Other themes of Wells's philosophy of history are developed in Ch. 12, \\"The World on the Eve of the War,\\" in discussions of Oswald's philosophy of history. \\"Men . . . are wills and part of a will that is . . . paradoxically free and bound. . . . Where was this alleged will of the species? If there was indeed such a will in the species, why was there this war? And yet, whatever it might be, assuredly there was something greater than himself sustaining his life. l . . There was a light upon his life, and the truth was that he could not discover the source of the light nor define its nature; there was a presence in the world about him that made all life worth while, and yet it was Nameless and Incomprehensible. It was the Essence beyond Reality; it was the Heart of All Things.\\"H.G. Wells, Joan and Peter, Ch. 14, ¬ß10 (London: Ernest Benn, 1929), pp. 461-62. After having published God the Invisible King the year before, in Joan and Peter Wells was in the process of pulling back from his theistic stance, but here he still presents religion among a number of equivalent symbols for the relation of humanity to the cosmos.H.G. Wells, Joan and Peter, Ch. 14, ¬ß6 (London: Ernest Benn, 1929), pp. 437-38. At the same time, Oswald is haunted by a nightmare in which this belief is denied and humanity is doomed: \\"It was the idea of a dark forest. And of an endless effort to escape from it. He was one of the captains of a vaguely conceived expedition that was lost in an interminable wilderness of shadows . . . and this forest which was Life, held him back; it held him with its darkness, it snared him with slime and marshy pitfalls, it entangled him admidst pools and channels of black and blood-red stinking water . . . Then far off through the straight bars of the tree stems a light shone, and a great hope sprang up in him. And then the light became red . . . and he realised that the forest had caught fire.\\"H.G.

Supranational * The European Commission condemned \\"all excessive and disproportionate use of force.\\" EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele said that Turkey must investigate the excessive use of force by police against anti-government protesters. The European Parliament passed a resolution on 13 June warning against the use of harsh measures against peaceful protesters, adding that those responsible for the police violence must be brought to justice, detained peaceful protestors immediately released and the victims compensated. While the resolution welcomed the moderate response to the protests by President Abdullah G√ºl and the apologies by Deputy Prime Minister B√ºlent Arin√ß, it deplored the unwillingness of the Turkish government and Erdoƒüan to take steps towards reconciliation, to apologize and to understand the reactions of a segment of the Turkish population. * The United Nations has expressed concern over reports of excessive use of force by law enforcement officers against protestors in Turkey.

He performed surveying, bridge design, and route design for a number of railroads in New England. Engineering career Laurie was born in Bellsquarry, Scotland in 1811; from the 1820s until 1832, he was apprenticed to an instrument maker in the town. In 1832, he and James P. Kirkwood moved to Boston; Laurie then worked as an associate engineer under Kirkwood on the construction of the Norwich and Worcester Railroad (N&W;). Laurie became chief engineer in 1835. In 1837, the Taft Tunnel at Lisbon, Connecticut (the oldest tunnel still in railroad use in its original form) was constructed during his tenure. After leaving the N&W;, Laurie performed surveys for railroads, canals, bridges, tunnels, and wharves. From 1845‚Äì47, he performed surveys for the Providence and Plainfield Railroad. In 1848, he opened his own office in Boston. From 1849 to 1851 he was an engineer for the New Jersey Central Railroad, which included planning the railroad's extension from Whitehouse, New Jersey to Easton, Pennsylvania. In 1852, he opened a second office in New York City. From 1853 until the early 1860s he was chief engineer of the Nova Scotia Railway. Under contract to the state of Massachusetts, he produced reports and surveys on the Troy & Greenfield Railroad and the unfinished Hoosac Tunnel in 1862. From 1861 to 1866, he was chief engineer of the Hartford and New Haven Railroad. During this time he oversaw the design and construction of the Warehouse Point railroad bridge ‚Äì one of the first iron bridges in the country. In 1870, he examined two under-construction bridges: the Lyman Viaduct for the state of Connecticut, and the Eads Bridge for its bond holders. American Society of Civil Engineers Laurie was an early attendee of Boston Society of Civil Engineers meetings; when it was incorporated in 1848, he was appointed president for two years. He was the first to present a paper to the society. In 1852 Laurie opened an office in New York and began to build on the success of the Boston group. On November 5, 1852 Laurie was one of twelve engineers who met and formed the first national- level society of engineers in the United States- the American Society of Civil Engineers and Architects. He soon was elected president. At a meeting on January 5, 1853 he presented the group's first paper, advocating an elevated railroad on Broadway to get around horse traffic congestion ‚Äì 15 years before the city's first elevated line was built. The group was inactive from 1855 to 1867, partially due to Laurie's absence from the city. In 1867, he held a meeting to reinvigorate the society, and uncovered funding to establish a permanent office for the group. When Kirkwood succeeded Laurie as president in 1868, he gave credit to Laurie for his contributions. Laurie had an interest in engineering ethics, and intended for the ASCE to represent the public interest and not merely those of its members. Although largely taught through experience rather than schooling, Laurie believed that proper education was essential for engineers and mandated that only college graduates could join the society. Never married, Laurie died in Hartford, Connecticut on March 16, 1875. The James Laurie Prize was established by ASCE on October 1, 1912. It is awarded annually to \\"a member of the Society who has made a definite contribution to the advancement of transportation engineering, either in research, planning, design, or construction.

He was the brother of Irene Kantakouzene, ƒêuraƒë's wife.  Origin  The Byzantinist Donald Nicol, who researched the family's history, categorically identifies him as the brother of George Palaiologos Kantakouzenos; Giovanni Musachi makes him the brother of Irene Kantakouzene, wife of Serbian Despot ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá, but incorrectly states Thomas was the son of the Emperor John VI Kantakouzenos, an error DuCange repeats. Instead, he is more probably the son of Theodore Kantakouzenos.. Nicol had backed away from his initial identification of Thomas' and George's father being Demetrios I Kantakouzenos; see his \\"The Byzantine Family of Kantakouzenos: Some Addenda and Corrigenda\\", Dumbarton Oaks Papers, 27 (1973), pp. 312f  Career  He was one of the many Greeks who entered the service of Despot ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá following his marriage to Irene Kantakouzene in 1414. Ragusan documents show he was present at the Despot's court in 1433 and 1435. In 1439 he took part in the defense of the Smederevo castle against the Ottoman Turks; historian Doukas records that when the castle fell after a siege of three months, the defenders who subsequently did homage to Sultan Murad II included Brankoviƒá's son Grgur and Thomas Kantakouzenos. Despite this ceremony, Kantakouzenos carried on the fight on behalf of his brother-in-law, leading the Despot's army to victory over Bosnian king Stephen Thomas on 16 September 1448, which restored Srebrenica and Vi≈°egrad to Serbian rule. In 1452 he led another Serbian army that invaded the Principality of Zeta, but was routed on 14 September by vojvoda Stefan Crnojeviƒá. Despite his position, following ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá's death Thomas was unable to shield his sister Irene from the cruelty of her son Lazar. On the night of Irene's death, 3 May 1457, he fled from Smederevo to Ottoman-ruled Adrianople with his niece Mara and his blinded nephew Grgur. Thomas was summoned to appear in court in Ragusa on 11 August 1459 and 18 March 1462, but Nicol doubts he answered the summons. The Serbian Annals record his death on 25 July 1463, immediately after the fall of the Serbian Despotate to the Ottomans.

He was known as a writer on Africa, evangelical Christian, close associate of David Livingstone and others involved in central and east African mission and exploration work, and advocate of British imperial expansion. Horace Waller, standing, with Henry Rowley, UMCA missionary (sitting), in a photograph of the 1860s Life Born in London, Waller was educated under Dr. Wadham at Brook Green. He was for some time in business in London. With the Universities' Mission to Central Africa (UMCA), Waller went out in 1861 to the regions recently visited by David Livingstone and Sir John Kirk. For a period he worked with Charles Frederick Mackenzie, bishop of Central Africa, and was associated with Livingstone in the Zambesi River and Shire Highlands districts. Returning to England after the death of Mackenzie in 1862, Waller was in 1867 ordained by the bishop of Rochester to the curacy of St. John, Chatham; in 1870 he moved to the vicarage of Leytonstone, Essex, and in 1874 to the rectory of Twywell, near Thrapston, Northamptonshire, which he resigned in 1895. Opposition to the slave trade was one of the main objects of Waller's life. In 1867 he attended the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society's conference in Paris, and in 1870 he became a member of the committee of the Anti-Slavery Society. In 1871 the House of Commons appointed a committee to investigate the East African slave trade; Waller and Edmund Murge pushed it to recommend Sir John Kirk as permanent political agent at Zanzibar. Ultimately a treaty between the Sultan of Zanzibar and Great Britain declared the slave trade by sea to be illegal. Waller was on good terms with General Charles George Gordon. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society in 1864, died at East Liss, Hampshire, on 22 February 1896, and was buried at Milland church on 26 February. Works After Henry Morton Stanley succeeded in discovering Livingstone in Africa, Livingstone's journals were given to Waller for publication. They were issued in two volumes in 1874, as The Last Journals of David Livingstone in Central Africa, from 1865 until his death. By omission, the image projected was of Livingstone as saintly; and the editorial line was that of anti-slavery. Waller's edition of the journals has been called \\"well-intentioned but unduly reverent\\".Gary Clendennen and James A.

The Castro Organ Devotees Association (CODA) is an American nonprofit organization dedicated to preserving and enhancing the tradition of live organ music in San Francisco's Castro Theatre.The Mighty Wurlitzer Organ Reinvented in Castro Theater: Plans to save iconic organ underway, by Heidi Smith, Castro Courier, November 2013. The theater is a popular San Francisco movie palace, built in the 1920s, which gained Historic Landmark status in 1976. The original Robert Morton organ was removed in the 1950s. The present organ, widely regarded as one of the finest theatre organs assembled, was assembled in the late 1970s using components from other organs, including its console, which was originally built in 1925 for the State Theatre in Detroit, Michigan to accompany silent pictures. The current console and organ were built by the Taylor family starting in 1979, and it has been owned and maintained by them since, but in 2014 they moved taking the console and one fourth of the pipework. David Hegarty, the Castro Theatre's resident organist, formed CODA to act as a rescue organization for the remaining parts, and formed a partnership with organ designer Alan Harrah who had previously built one of the largest electronic organs in the world. Together they are constructing one of the largest electronic organs in the western United States with seven keyboards, retaining 800 organ pipes.The Wanamaker Grand Court Organ, in Philadelphia, is the largest operational organ in the world, located within a 7-story court at Macy's Center City (formerly Wanamaker's department store). CODA is set up as an educational and outreach foundation to get the organ bought, and built including installing the expanded console, replacing and increasing the pipes, and coordinating the ongoing fundraising and outreach to build awareness of theater organs. Hegarty noted the Bay Area already has \\"more world-class theater organs than any area in the country.\\" The Music Man: For 23 1/2 years, he's made Castro Theatre's pipe organ hum, Carol Ness, San Francisco Chronicle, Monday, February 18, 2002. Once the installation is complete CODA hopes to; have students intern and practice playing the large instrument, set up tours and special events, and act as an attraction for people who seek out the music of the large pipe organs including concert organists. The initial fundraising efforts have been budgeted at $1 million US dollars. History of the Castro Theatre The Castro Theatre is located on Castro Street near the intersection of Market and 17th Streets, across from the Castro Street Station on the Muni Metro subway. Located at 429 Castro Street, in the Castro district, it was built in 1922 with a Spanish Colonial Baroque fa√ßade that pays homage‚Äîin its great arched central window surmounted by a scrolling pediment framing a niche‚Äîto the recently rebuilt basilica of Mission Dolores nearby. Its designer, Timothy L. Pflueger, also designed Oakland's Paramount Theater and other movie theaters in California in that period. The theater has 1407 seats. It is one of the few 1920s theater houses still in operation in the U.S. The original Castro Theatre was located down the street from the present location at 479 Castro Street The Castro Theatre originally opened at 479 Castro Street in 1910. The building was remodeled into a retail store ‚Äì currently occupied by Cliff's Variety Store, since 1971 ‚Äì in the mid-1920s after the larger Castro Theatre was built up the street at 429 Castro Street. The new theater opened in June 1922. The interior is luxurious and ornate, with subtly convex and concave walls and ceiling and the dramatic Mighty Wurlitzer Hope-Jones Unit Orchestra pipe organ that is played before films and events. It is San Francisco's last single-screen movie palace. Today, the Castro Theatre hosts repertory movies, film festivals, and special events, including gay and multicultural focus. In recent years, the Castro has been the site for gala tributes to many legendary Hollywood stars making appearances with a showing of one of their movies, including Tony Curtis, Ann-Margret, Debbie Reynolds, Jane Russell, and Sandra Dee‚Äîmany of the events produced by local impresario Marc Huestis.Wiegand, David: \\"Marc Huestis grew up wanting to be either and actor or president.

Organ history The Castro Theatre opened at its present location in 1922. The original Robert Morton organ installed in the early 1920s was removed in the 1950s. In the 1970s a C.G. Conn 651 organ was used until the late 1970s when the Taylor family worked to install a Mighty Wurlitzer. Ray Taylor and his sons began \\"assembling the all-Wurlitzer pipe organ in 1979\\", getting parts from many sources, like the console from a Detroit theater. The present organ is a collection of parts pulled together in the late 1970s, as was regarded as one of the finest theatre organs assembled. The organ still belongs to the Taylors, who have maintained and updated the instrument over the past thirty years. The ownership of the organ has remained separate from the ownership of the theater where it resides. The assembled Mighty Wurlitzer Hope-Jones Unit Orchestra console and organ were leased to the Castro Theatre in 1978, the deal taking four years to culminate in an agreement. When the last theater lease expired July 2001, the Nasser family took over management of the theater. Now the Taylors, who maintained the organ for nearly forty years, are moving and taking the console and a fourth of the pipework sometime in 2014. The organ was due for major reconstruction. David Hegarty, who has been the main organist at the Castro Theatre, and also plays at a few other Bay Area theaters, has been playing at the Castro Theatre almost nightly since 1983. He contacted Alan Harrah, an electronic organ designer, former president of Rodgers, and close friend who had built one of the largest electronic organs in the world. The two conceived a plan to create the largest combination pipe/electronic organ in the world with seven keyboards and 800 stop controls. Digital organs have developed greatly over the last two decades, and are a cheaper alternative to the pipe organ, particularly in churches. Digital organs by custom builders have become a viable alternative for venues who may have had a pipe organ and can no longer afford to maintain it, or for those situations where a pipe organ is not financially possible. All-digital and pipe/digital combination organs now significantly outsell pipe organs. Hegarty formed a non-profit group CODA, and they secured a grant to buy the remaining parts of the present organ set-up minus the console and a fourth of the pipes. The current owners of the Castro Theatre are very supportive of the effort as the refurbishment fits in with their plans to offer more special and performing arts events instead of relying on movie sales. CODA is using outreach techniques including concerts, facility tours, lectures, and organ conventions and events. Organ console The Mighty Wurlitzer Hope-Jones Unit Orchestra console, from the Nethercutt Collection, showing four manuals and colour-coded stop tabs. The configuration of the Castro Theatre's current hybrid organ is similar. The new console will have seven manuals which is designed so that every key can be reached while performing. The Castro Theatre's pipe ranks are split on either side of the stage and hidden by large organ grills. A pipe organ is played from an area called the console or keydesk, which holds the manual keyboards that look like a traditional piano keyboard, pedals, and stop controls. This is where the organist resides whether the listener can see the person or not. At the Castro Theatre the console is presently in the front center of the stage facing the screen.A behind the screens look at the Castro's David Hegarty by Andrew Gilbert, WHERE SAN FRANCISCO / APRIL 2002. The entire console is on a platform that is raised up before an event, stage show, or movie starts. It is usually lowered right before the stage show unfolds and commonly in conjunction with the chorus of \\"Theme from San Francisco\\" with the audience clapping along. The Castro Theatre owners have stated they want the refurbished and expanded organ to remain the centerpiece of the theater. Controls at the console called stops select which ranks and pipes are used. These controls are generally either draw knobs (or stop knobs), which engage the stops when pulled out from the console. Different combinations of stops change the timbre of the instrument considerably. The selection of stops is called the registration. On modern organs, the registration can be changed instantaneously with the aid of a combination action, usually featuring pistons. Pistons are buttons that can be pressed by the organist to change registrations; they are generally found between the manuals or above the pedalboard. In the latter case they are called toe studs or toe pistons (as opposed to thumb pistons). Most large organs have both preset and programmable pistons, with some of the couplers repeated for convenience as pistons and toe studs. Programmable pistons allow comprehensive control over changes in registration. Newer organs may have multiple levels of solid-state memory, allowing each piston to be programmed more than once. This allows more than one organist to store their own registrations. Many newer consoles also feature MIDI, which allows the organist to record performances. It also allows an external keyboard to be plugged in, which assists in tuning and maintenance. The new configured pipe/digital organ will allow for a fuller range of possibilities and broaden the appeal of the Castro Theatre as a \\"major organ center.\\" ReferencesExternal links *Official website Category:Organizations based in San Francisco ","title":"Castro Organ Devotees Association"},{"id":"40968456","text":"Mai Leisz, photographed by Anna C Webber in Los Angeles, CA.

Name Jerova Vas was attested in written sources in 1305 as Phapphendorf (and as ' in 1496, ' in 1634, and ' in 1685). The Slovene name literally means \\"priest's village\\" (from Slovene ' 'priest'), and thus referred to an estate owned by the clergy. This explanation is confirmed by the medieval German name Phapphendorf, which has the same meaning (from Middle High German pfaffe \\"priest\\" + dorf \\"village\\"). In the past the German name was Irrdorf. History The economy of the village was traditionally tied to farming, especially raising potatoes and grain. Animal husbandry was also important and milk was sold to Grosuplje and Ljubljana. A water main was installed to Jerova Vas from Black Valley () near Dobje in 1910. Jerova Vas was annexed by the town of Grosuplje in 1971, ending its existence as an independent settlement.Spremembe naselij 1948‚Äì95. 1996. Database. Ljubljana: Geografski in≈°titut ZRC SAZU, DZS.

History of education In 1970 Westwood, along with some other White communities, was rezoned from Westbury to Madison High School because of a court ruling. By 1990, Westbury was about 50% Black, 25% White, 15% Hispanic, and 10% Asian while Madison was 1% White. In 1992 an attendance boundary shift occurred but Westwood was still in the Madison zone. The residents wanted to be rezoned to Westbury. Rod Paige, then the board president and HISD trustee for district 9, and board member Donald R. McAdams attended a meeting at a house of a Westwood community leader on May 12, 1992.McAdams, p. 55. McAdams, who authored Fighting to Save Our Urban Schools-- and Winning!: Lessons from Houston, recalled that the Westwood residents said \\"Westwood is an integrated community. Whites, blacks, Hispanics, and Asians live happily together in almost perfect balance. All of us want to be rezoned from Madison to Westbury. Westbury is our neighborhood high school. It is closer than Madison.\\"McAdams, p. 55-56. McAdams wrote that the demographics of the community meeting confirmed the statement about ethnic diversity.McAdams, p. 56. According to McAdams, HISD superintendent Frank Petruzielo initially did not adopt the recommendations from himself and Paige because he feared black administrators in HISD would not support the move, so McAdams and Westwood community leaders made a presentation to the HISD board explaining the merits of the case. The board unanimously rezoned the community to Westbury. Parks and recreation The City of Houston operates Westwood Park, located in Section 4.\\"Our Parks O-Z.\\" City of Houston.

It is located on Obernstrasse and S√∂gestrasse, in the old town in the city centre. Completed in 1932, the building was listed in 2010 as a notable example of department store architecture in the interwar period.  History The first building was built on the corner of S√∂gestrasse and Pelzerstrasse by Rudolph Karstadt AG., established in 1881 by Rudolph Karstadt. The first branch in Bremen had opened in the year of 1902. Between 1930 and 1932, a new building was built on the corner of Obernstrasse and S√∂gestrasse. There were two architects: the Bremen office of Heinrich Wilhelm Behrens (1873-1956) and Friedrich Neumark. The building was designed in accordance with the approach of the Karstadt construction office under the leadership of Philipp Schaefer. In 2010, the building was listed for heritage protection under the Monuments Act. The Landesamt f√ºr Denkmalpflege Bremen (LfD), the Department for Preservation and Protection of Historical Buildings, describes it as a five-storey building with a concrete frame, faced with a coarsely embossed surface of Ettringen tuff.Landesamt f√ºr Denkmalpflege Bremen, Retrieved 5 October 2013. Its architecture is considered representative of the department store style of the second and third decades of the 20th century. Together with the Nordwolle building (‚ÄúHaus des Reichs‚Äù) and the concert hall \\"Die Glocke\\", it a prime example of architectural development in the city of Bremen between the two wars, notable above all for its particularly modern look. Philipp Schaefer had developed an architectural language which was not only consistent but also convincing in a formal sense. The old building in S√∂gestrasse was subsequently used for low-priced commodities under the name of \\"EPA-Warenhaus\\" and later \\"Kepa-Kaufhaus\\". During the Second World War, it was completely destroyed. When the department store \\"Kepa-Kaufhaus\\" closed, its post-war building was demolished. In 1995, \\"Karstadt-Sports\\", a department store for sports goods was built, designed by Ingenhoven & Ingenhoven from Neuss. When the department store Horten came to Bremen, Karstadt had the opportunity to buy the building housing the DeFaKa- department store in Obernstrasse. The fa√ßade of that building had a brown metallic covering. In 1965, it underwent major refurbishment with the closure of the atrium and the installation of four escalators.  Business development  Karstadt was involved when the \\"Grosse Hundestrasse\\" was converted into the \\"Lloyd-Passage\\" pedestrian zone. After its expansion, Karstadt became the largest department store in Northern Germany. In terms of variety of goods, it was Germany's fourth largest. In its building on Obernstrasse, there are seven floors covering of sales area. In the basement, there is a sizeable foodstuffs area. Up to 1,000 employees are employed in the Karstadt branch.

Due to the large area covered by the combined habitats of these bird species, Chandlerella quiscali is found throughout North America. This area diversity is further aided by the fact that 98% of grackles possess this parasite, and grackles are consistently found in various North American locations. History This species was originally called the Filaria quiscali by its discoverer, von Linstow (1904), due to pieces of the posterior ends of females removed from the area under the pia mater of the cerebrum in grackle. In 1960, this worm was incorrectly placed in the genus Splendidofilaria by Odetoyinbo and Ulmer. Due to the fact that its esophagus and cuticle don't match those of this particular genus, it had to then be removed from this group. Anderson and Freeman correctly placed this species in the genus Chandlerella in 1969, proving that von Linstow's previous naming of the worm was indeed correct. Effects of infection in birds Birds that are infected by Chandlerella quiscali normally do not display symptoms, but those that do, do so in the form of torticollis or ataxia.

The species produces 5 to 8 deciduous leaves that are dark green with a reddish edge, smooth, broad, tongue-shaped, hugging the ground when mature, and developing after flowering. It has a globose bulb with a tunic typically brittle and coppery-brown. In common with other Brunsvigia species, plants will not flower if repeatedly disturbed by replanting. The flowers are especially fragrant at night, during which period they are pollinated by sphingid and noctuid moths. In common with other members of the family, this species forms large spherical fruiting heads which detach from the plant at maturity and efficiently disperse seeds while being bowled along by the wind (see tumbleweed). Infusions of the bulbs have been used for medicinal and hallucinogenic purposes. Brunsvigia species are rich in alkaloids, particularly brunsvigine or 5,11b-methanomorphanthridine, and may be extremely toxic.South African National Biodiversity Institute\\"Alkaloids of the amaryllidaceae: Brunsvigine\\" - Tetrahedron, Volume 31, Issue 16, Pages 1855-1859 - R.C.

Content North Italian Church Music presents an overview of sacred music published by Venetian printing houses in the first half of the seventeenth century. In contrast with many assessments of the period, which focus on the works of Claudio Monteverdi and Giovanni Gabrieli, the book highlights particularly the contributions of composers who are less familiar to modern audiences, such as Ignazio Donati, Alessandro Grandi and Giovanni Rovetta. Many of the pieces that Roche discusses were not available in modern editions at the time the book was published, meaning the inclusion of a larger quantity of illustrative examples than other similar works. The first section of the book provides a historical and social context for the later chapters. Roche gives an overview of the church's attitude towards changes in musical styles around the turn of the seventeenth century, discusses the musical institutions connected with sacred music, and explores the use of liturgy in motets. The subsequent four chapters discuss specific works composed between 1605 and 1643, with each chapter focussed on works for a different number of voices. Chapter V discusses pieces for one to three voices, Chapter VI those for four to six voices, and Chapter VII and VIII those for seven or more voices. The book concludes with a short survey of developments during the rest of the seventeenth century. Background and publication The book has its origins in Jerome Roche's 1968 PhD dissertation, which was supervised by Denis Arnold at Cambridge University. It was published by Clarendon Press (an imprint of Oxford University Press), as part of their \\"Oxford Monographs on Music\\" series. Reception Jonathan Glixon, writing in Renaissance Quarterly, praised the book, commenting that it would have a particular value \\"when the fascinating music discussed by Professor Roche becomes more readily available in print and in recordings\\". Glixon considered the final chapter of the introduction to be the \\"best discussion in print of the role of liturgical texts in motets\\".

Fronted by B-movie actor Dukey Flyswatter, the band is known for their campy science fiction and horror movie-inspired songs and elaborately bloody and prop-filled stage shows. The original incarnation of Haunted Garage lasted from 1985 to 1993, with several one-off reunions featuring varying line-ups occurring afterwards. As of 2013, a new version of the band is currently active with Flyswatter as the only remaining original member. Biography Haunted Garage was formed in 1985 by vocalist Dukey Flyswatter (stage name of Michael Sonye), bassist Ace McCoomba and guitarist Nyck Varoom. Initially, the band started out in a psychedelic/rockabilly style, playing covers of theme songs from vintage B movies (\\"You know, 'The South Is Gonna Rise Again' from Two Thousand Maniacs!, and Hideous Sun Demon and The Blob and stuff like that\\", according to Flyswatter) before eventually writing original material in a similar B movie-inspired vein. Following the addition of transvestite lead guitarist Gaby Godhead and drummer Stiff Slug, Haunted Garage's sound evolved into a more aggressive fusion of horror punk and heavy metal, a mix which the Los Angeles Times described as \\"The Dickies doing Alice Cooper\\" but which Flyswatter referred to as \\"splatter punk\\". Dukey Flyswatter at a reunion show in November 2013. Haunted Garage was most recognized, however, for their over-the-top shock rock stage shows, featuring violent and surrealist theatrics which LA Weekly wrote made them \\"local horror-punk legends\\". Similar to bands such as Gwar, their shows regularly showcased an array of elaborate horror-themed costumes and props, with copious amounts of fake blood and slime sprayed into the audience while a collection of scantily-clad female dancers - dubbed \\"The Gore Gore Girls\\" - maintained a permanent stage presence beside the band. Dukey Flyswatter would often use hatpins to pierce various parts of his body onstage before settling on his trademark schtick, sticking mousetraps on his face. These flamboyant antics helped the band maintain a visible presence in the Los Angeles scene, performing with such high-profile bands such as The Cramps, the Butthole Surfers, Gwar, Misfits, White Zombie and Screamin' Jay Hawkins and regularly playing and headlining such famous nightclubs as the Whisky a Go Go, The Roxy Theatre and Raji's. In a 2013 interview, Tool drummer Danny Carey reminisced about a late '80s concert with Haunted Garage, Green Jell√ø and Pygmy Love Circus - \\"the three kind of big psycho bands of L.A.\\" - as one of his most memorable shows. In addition to the band's horror movie-inspired aesthetic, frontman Dukey Flyswatter worked on many low-budget B movies during his tenure with Haunted Garage, acting in numerous films including the cult classics Surf Nazis Must Die, Sorority Babes in the Slimeball Bowl-O-Rama and Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers, as well as writing the screenplays for Blood Diner and Fred Olen Rays Prison Ship and Commando Squad, among others. In 1987, Haunted Garage contributed several exclusive songs for the soundtrack to the film Nightmare Sisters, which also featured Flyswatter in an acting role, and appeared onscreen as a band in 1987's Cyclone and 1989's Breakfast of Aliens. In 1992, the band appeared on an episode of The Montel Williams Show alongside Sean Brennan of London After Midnight and Vlad of Dark Theater in a special about gothic rock and the vampire subculture. In 1989, after independently releasing the demo tape Songs About Satan & Other Stuff to Piss Your Parents Off, Haunted Garage released the four-song 7\\" EP Mothers Day on Sympathy for the Record Industry before signing to Metal Blade Records, releasing their first and only full-length album Possession Park in August 1991. Possession Park received generally positive reviews from critics, with AllMusic calling the album \\"extremely fun and outrageously entertaining\\", writing that the band \\"should have been a lot more well-known\\", while the Chicago Tribune, though deriding the band as \\"Gwar Junior\\", admitted of the album's macabre sense of humor, \\"[a]s cheesy as it is, it's good for a laugh\\". Following the album's release, Haunted Garage carried out a tour of the United States and Europe supporting The Cramps before ultimately breaking up, playing their \\"final\\" show at the Coconut Teaszer on November 25, 1992. Since their disbandment, Flyswatter has attempted to revive Haunted Garage several times with varying line-ups. Three one-off reunions with Flyswatter and Godhead were held at the Whisky a Go Go in 1995, a Thanksgiving show in 2001 and Safari Sam's on June 16, 2008. In 2001, Flyswatter and Godhead appeared on an episode of The Clint Howard Variety Show, in which they announced plans to revive the band, though these plans would eventually fall through. In 2013, Flyswatter formed a new version of the band with himself as the sole original member, performing the first of a series of shows at Los Angeles' California Institute of Abnormalarts on October 5, 2013 with The Radioactive Chicken Heads, followed by a co-headlining appearance alongside The Dickies at the Long Beach Zombie Walk. In August 2015, Haunted Garage began recording an EP under the production of Paul Roessler, marking their first recorded material in twelve years and first studio release since 1991. The EP, entitled Slenderman and Other Strange Tales was released digitally on various music streaming and download sites on January 13, 2016, with a physical CD release the following April. The album's title song, based on the creepypasta legend Slender Man and the 2012 stabbing case, received some minor media attention in the wake of the 2016 HBO documentary Beware the Slenderman. On December 10, 2018, Dukey Flyswatter underwent brain surgery to remove a tumor near his visual cortex, for which Haunted Garage - including Flyswatter - performed a benefit show for days prior on December 1. As detailed on the band's official Facebook page, Flyswatter's tumor was removed and declared \\"benign\\" by medical professionals, though band activity would significantly slow down as he remained in recovery. On May 18, 2019, Flyswatter returned to the stage for a Haunted Garage show in Los Angeles. On August 9, heavy metal blog and promotion company Metal Assault released the cassette tape compilation Metal Assault Mixtape - Vol. 1, which featured a brand new Haunted Garage song, \\"Surf Nazis Must Die\\", based on the 1987 cult film starring Flyswatter. Haunted Garage headlined Metal Assault's \\"Mixtape Release Party\\" in Encino on August 31, 2019, which is to date the band's most recent show.

It was proposed by British Indian Government to China in 1899 via its envoy to China, Sir Claude MacDonald. The Chinese Government never gave any response to the proposal. Subsequently, the British Indian Government is said to have reverted to its traditional boundary, the Johnson‚ÄìArdagh Line.  History  1936 map of the Republic of China, which appears to show the Macartney-MacDonald Line as the Kashmir border; both the Yarkand and Karakash river valleys are included in Xinjiang. William Johnson, a civil servant with the Survey of India proposed the \\"Johnson Line\\" in 1865, which put Aksai Chin in Kashmir. This was accepted by China until 1893, when Hung Ta-chen, a senior Chinese official at St. Petersburg, gave maps of the region to George Macartney, the British consul at Kashgar, which coincided with it in broad details.: \\"Clarke added that a Chinese map drawn by Hung Ta-chen, Minister in St. Petersburg, confirmed the Johnson alignment showing West Aksai Chin as within British (Kashmir) territory.\\" However, by 1896, China showed interest in Aksai Chin, reportedly with Russian instigation. As part of The Great Game between Britain and Russia, Britain decided on a revised boundary ceding underpopulated border territory to be \\"filled out\\" by China. It was initially suggested by Macartney in Kashgar and developed by the Governor General of India Lord Elgin. The new boundary placed the Lingzi Tang plains, which are south of the Laktsang range, in India, and Aksai Chin proper, which is north of the Laktsang range, in China. The British presented this line, currently called the Macartney‚ÄìMacDonald line, to the Chinese in a note by Sir Claude MacDonald, the British envoy in Peking. The Qing government did not respond to the note. Scholars Fisher, Rose and Huttenback comment: The Macartney‚ÄìMacDonald Line is a partial basis of the Sino-Pakistan Agreement. It has been suggested that a solution to the Sino-Indian border dispute could also be based on the Macartney‚ÄìMacDonald Line. \\"China was the Aggrieved; India, Aggressor in '62\\", Kai Friese interview Neville Maxwell, Outlook, 22 October 2012.

Extensive surface and very diverse geometry make cage compounds with an encapsulated metal ion (clathrochelates) suitable for targeting both the active and allosteric sites of enzymes as well as the interfaces of their macromolecular complexes. An efficient structure- and concentration-dependent transcription inhibition in a model in vitro systems based on RNA and DNA polymerases by the iron(II) mono- and bis-clathrochelates at their submicro- and nanomolar concentrations, respectively, is observed in. Molecular docking and preincubation experiments suggested that these cage compounds form supramolecular assemblies with protein residues as well as with DNA and RNA. Thus, they are prospective precursors for the design of antiviral and anticancer drug candidates. The modern approach to the pharmaceutical screening is based on several paradigms and empirical rules. They limit the chemical compounds that have a potential as pharmaceuticals for diagnostics and therapy; many chemical systems and classes have been excluded from the routine screening studies and, therefore, are terra incognita for biochemists, pharmacologists, and clinicians. For example, one of the Lipinski's rules states that the molecular weight of the chemical compounds that can be used for pharmaceutical screening should be under 500 Da. The biological activity of these low-weight compounds, constituting up to 90% of the pharmaceutical market (by nomenclature), in most cases is governed by their interactions with biological targets via either covalent or supramolecular bonding. The selectivity and specificity of these interactions determine the potential of the low-weight chemical compounds in drug therapy (for example, in the cases of the virus infections and the neurodegenerative diseases). Among the low-weight pharmaceuticals, the xenobiotic and abiotic compounds, which have neither the natural analogs nor the structural similarity to the biological molecules, are of particular interest. An example of such abiotic (xenobiotic) compounds is the carbocyclic adamantane derivatives. These compounds are widely used in drug therapy of the human diseases and references therein, and references therein. Second type of the pharmaceuticals available on the market comprises the biological, biologically revealed, and biomimetic macromolecules with molecular weights more than 2000 Da, the therapeutic activity of which is defined mainly by the complex protein ‚Äì protein interactions. This class of the high-weight biological macromolecules includes, for example, insulins, enzymes, interferons, proteins (albumin, etc.), and vaccines as well. At the same time, only limited number of the middle-weight compounds with a molecular weight from 500 to 2000 Da is used as the therapeutics or is now under study as potent chemical compounds for drug therapy and diagnostics. Besides the restrictions applied on the bioavailability of the middle-weight molecules, their screening seems to be prospective owing to the multicentered and geometrically directed interactions that these molecules can form with biological targets (i.e., the topological recognition of a ‚Äúguest‚Äù middle- weight molecule by a ‚Äúhost‚Äù biological receptor). The success of the drug therapy of the virus and Parkinson's diseases using abiotic polyhedral adamantane molecules suggests the pharmaceutical potential of other xenobiotics with rigid three-dimensional molecular structure. For example, the functionalized fullerenes have been used for drug therapy of the HIV and other virus diseases: their hydrophobic ball-like molecules ‚Äúblock‚Äù a virus active site. This site can also be a target for other xenobiotics, which are geometrically similar to those of the functionalized fullerenes and are complementary to the HIV protease active site,. Cage complexes with a metal ion encapsulated in a three-dimensional macropolycyclic ligand cavity (clathrochelates) Y. Z. Voloshin, N. A. Kostromina, R. Kr√§mer \\"Clathrochelates: synthesis, structure, and properties\\" Elsevier, Amsterdam, 2002. are the topological analogs of the fullerene derivatives with similar geometric parameters. This similarity between the clathrochelates and the functionalized fullerenes has been confirmed by the molecular docking of a set of the clathrochelate structures to the active site of the HIV protease.Y. Voloshin, O. Varzatskii, V. Novikov, Y. Bubnov, Biochemical and medicinal application of cage transition metal complexes: the design of new HIV protease inhibitors, Proceedings of the 9th European Biological Inorganic Chemistry Conference EUROBIC 9, Wroc≈Çaw, Poland, September 2‚Äì6, 2008, 71‚Äì76. Most these calculated macrobicyclic inhibitors have the same mode of the inhibition as their fullerene-containing analogs, and the calculated (for clathrochelates and fullerenes) and experimental (for fullerenes) inhibition constants are close. When the influence of the cage metal complexes on biochemical processes is based on the topological similarity of their molecules to those of the chemical compounds with improved biological and pharmaceutical activities, the applicability of these clathrochelates is determined by their availability. The clathrochelate molecules have four axes and eight sites of functionalization. In contrast to the functionalized fullerenes, such direct functionalization may be easily employed using convenient procedures and commercially available chemical reagents. Thus, the three-dimensional rigid cage molecules with given location of the pharmacophore substituents can be obtained, i.e. it is possible to use their clathrochelate frameworks as the three-dimensional scaffolds for the design of the topological drugs. So, (i) the specific abiotic interactions of the middle-weight molecules (for example, the clathrochelates) with biological macromolecules are possible, (ii) these interactions may change both the structure and the functions of these macromolecules, (iii) the middle-weight conformationally rigid macropolycyclic complexes with biomimetic substituents (‚Äúguests‚Äù) that bind to the molecules of the biological target (‚Äúhosts‚Äù) are prospective for the drug design, (iv) the macropolycyclic framework may be considered as a scaffold for the direct ‚Äúbottom-up‚Äù synthesis of the biologically active compounds based on the ‚Äúgeometrical recognition‚Äù and ‚Äútopological invasion‚Äù principles, (v) the clathrochelate complexes of transition metals are suitable for the design of the ‚Äútopological drugs‚Äù owing to the availability of these geometrically well- organized three-dimensional macrobicycles, (vi) there are effective pathways for the direct synthesis of the functionalized clathrochelates with different symmetry, structure, and chemical reactivity, as well as of the complexes with given physical and physico-chemical properties. The concept of the ‚Äútopological drugs‚Äù seems to be a promising one for the drug search from the library of the middle-weight compounds as well as for the decrease of the resistance to the pharmaceutically active chemical compounds. This concept needs both the theoretical studies and the experimental improvements of different biological and biomimetic systems as well as of various types of the cage complexes.Y. Voloshin, O.

The first one to get the right to answer the question asked by the Host is in the game. If a correct answer is given, he or she will go on the stage.  Round Two  The contestant selected from the crowd plays head-to- head against each of the 6 celebrity contestants. The game is similar to the original version, but the clock is removed. They are asked questions in turns, and the questions are as follows: *The Missing Next Line-- The host asks a sentence from an ancient Chinese poem, but there is one line missing. The contestant must recite the missing line. ::Example: When the host says \\"Êú¨ÊòØÂêåÊ†πÁîü\\"(This is the same root, originally by Cao Zhi's \\"‰∏ÉÊ≠•ËØó\\", A Poem in Seven Steps), the contestant must recite \\"Áõ∏ÁÖé‰ΩïÂ§™ÊÄ•\\"(Why do you want to kill me?) for the next missing line. *Multiple Choice Questions. The head-to-head contest ends when a person fails to answer a question correctly or to run out of time. The loser will be dropped under the stage. Usually the host says \\"Âêé‰ºöÊúâÊúü\\" (farewell), and the eliminated contestant's trapdoor immediately opens and he or she is dropped through the floor. Each elimination of the celebrity contestants is worth ¬•2,000 (~$300). After 2 celebrity contestants have been eliminated, the contestant has an opportunity to walk away from the game. If the contestant fails to win the next round, half of the prize money is lost. If he or she is eliminated in the first two rounds, there is no prize for the contestant.

The guests asks the contestant 5 questions about Chinese poetry where the contestant must answer the missing two lines or the missing sentence for each poem. If the contestant answers correctly, ¬•30,000(~$4,700) is awarded. All the contestants who makes it to the third round proceeds to the finale.  The Repechage (Season 1 Episode 12)  In this episode, the game is played in two rounds. *Round 1: Six contestants answer the questions in turns. Failure to answer a question correctly, he or she will be eliminated and dropped down the stage.

Answering incorrectly, he or she can not play the question. The person who has the least right answers will be eliminated.  The Semifinal (Season 1 Episode 13)  This episode is played in two rounds. *Round 1: Contestants answer in turns. They must answer the line in the poem with the allowed words(animals, colors, the character \\"Ëä±\\", etc.). If a contestant could not in play in this round.

While in high school, Lee decided to become a farmer. In a dramatic display of his new determination, he burned his school uniform on the beach and moved to a mountainous region in Gwangwon Province where he devoted himself to vegetable farming for two years. Failing health and desire for more education, however, compelled him to return to school and he entered college as an economics major with special interest in advertising. .\\"Lee Sun-won\\" LTI Korea Datasheet available at LTI Korea Library or online at: http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do# Work Lee Soon-won's work is populated with characters who lead a life of consumption outside of the limitations of established society or traditional order. These characters serve as the canvas upon which the values and lifestyle of the new popular consumer society are sketched. By showing the ultimate emptiness and meaninglessness of such lives, Lee assesses the new world pessimistically. Lee's literary world is as diverse and hard to categorize as his background. He has lived in both urban and rural areas, deep in the mountains and in the seaside towns and has developed a wide range of interests from the tradition of Confucian culture to advertising. Consequently, his works exhibit a great spectrum of literary concerns. In There is No Exit in Apgujeong District, Lee explores the radical idea of terrorism as a possible response to the corruption in capitalist culture. Face is a short story about the May 19th Democratic Uprising and Nineteen is an autobiographical novel that belongs to the genre of Bildungsroman. Innocence is a serial novel that depicts the lives of women scarred by either direct or indirect acts of violence. Though diverse in subject matter, Lee's works share the underlying concern with growing insensitivity to violence and change in modern society and our indifference to the suffering of others. Over the years, however, the sharply critical tone of his works has grown relatively mild. The Color of Water, the Pattern of That Shade published in 1996 marks a point of change in the author's perspective from cold and analytical to warm and compassionate. The Color of Water, the Pattern of That Shade is a moving story of family hardships and maternal love which also explores the negative side-effects of rapid industrialization.

The villa has been restored, and is now a museum and cultural centre open to the public and for research. Its architect has been described as the \\"founder of modern Czech architecture\\". History Jan Kotƒõra designed this villa for Franti≈°ek Trmal, a leading teacher and inspector of schools, for whom it is still named. Construction began in 1902 and was completed the following year. The building stands on the corner of Vilov√° and U Nov√Ωch vil. It was one of Kotera's early designs, and is therefore important since Kotera is regarded as a leading Czech architect and \\"the founder of modern Czech architecture\\".Jan Kotƒõra, 1871-1923: the founder of modern Czech architecture, Municipal House, 2001, retrieved 3 November 2013 In 1911 the original owner sold the villa to Tereza and Franti≈°ek Walek, who installed a winter garden and a terrace.

In 2001 a three-year programme of repair was completed, and it was reopened to the public. Today it functions as a centre for architects studying Jan Kotera's legacy, and as a museum. The displays inside explain the architecture of similar buildings and other related themes.Jan Kotera, Hotels in Czech, retrieved 4 November 2013 Description A QRpedia code gives access to this article. Although the house has some Czech folk design aspects, its dormer windows, tall chimneys, gable ends with exposed beams and its complex tiled roof establish it as a design based on modern English traditions. The house also has Czech aspects, and ideas from the Arts and Crafts Movement due to the influence of Charles Voysey on Jan Kotƒõra's ideas. A key point of the design is the craft-built staircase which is decorated with floral-inspired geometric designs on the stairs and the painted beamed ceiling. The staircase gives access to a dining room and living room on the ground floor, and bedrooms and a children's room on the first floor. The house is still set in the gardens Kotƒõra designed, although today it is surrounded by houses built after the Second World War. The house was not intended to be surrounded by other buildings, and was designed to allow the owner to keep farm animals in an outside shed. Today the garden still has Kotera's winding pathways leading to open porches, but the original picket fence is no longer there. Originally the house had three entrances.

Point process notation Point processes are mathematical objects that are defined on some underlying mathematical space. Since these processes are often used to represent collections of points randomly scattered in physical space, time or both, the underlying space is usually d-dimensional Euclidean space denoted here by \\\\textstyle \\\\textbf{R}^{ d}, but they can be defined on more abstract mathematical spaces. Point processes have a number of interpretations, which is reflected by the various types of point process notation. For example, if a point \\\\textstyle x belongs to or is a member of a point process, denoted by \\\\textstyle {N}, then this can be written as: : \\\\textstyle x\\\\in {N}, and represents the point process being interpreted as a random set. Alternatively, the number of points of \\\\textstyle {N} located in some Borel set \\\\textstyle B is often written as: : \\\\textstyle {N}(B), which reflects a random measure interpretation for point processes. These two notations are often used in parallel or interchangeably. Definitions=n-th power of a point process For some integer \\\\textstyle n=1,2,\\\\dots, the \\\\textstyle n-th power of a point process \\\\textstyle {N} is defined as: : {N}^n(B_1\\\\times\\\\cdots\\\\times B_n)= \\\\prod_{i=1}^n{N}(B_i) where \\\\textstyle B_1,...,B_n is a collection of not necessarily disjoint Borel sets (in \\\\textstyle \\\\textbf{R}^{ d}), which form a \\\\textstyle n-fold Cartesian product of sets denoted by B_1\\\\times\\\\cdots\\\\times B_n. The symbol \\\\textstyle \\\\Pi denotes standard multiplication. The notation \\\\textstyle {N}(B_i) reflects the interpretation of the point process \\\\textstyle {N} as a random measure. The \\\\textstyle n-th power of a point process \\\\textstyle {N} can be equivalently defined as: : {N}^{n}(B_1\\\\times\\\\cdots\\\\times B_n)= \\\\sum_{(x_1,\\\\dots, x_n)\\\\in {N} } \\\\prod_{i=1}^n \\\\mathbf{1}_{B_i}(x_i) where summation is performed over all \\\\textstyle n-tuples of (possibly repeating) points, and \\\\textstyle \\\\mathbf{1} denotes an indicator function such that \\\\textstyle \\\\mathbf{1}_{B_1} is a Dirac measure. This definition can be contrasted with the definition of the n-factorial power of a point process for which each n-tuples consists of n points. n-th moment measure The \\\\textstyle n-th moment measure is defined as: : M^n(B_1\\\\times\\\\ldots\\\\times B_n)=E [{N}^n(B_1\\\\times\\\\ldots\\\\times B_n)], where the E denotes the expectation (operator) of the point process \\\\textstyle {N}. In other words, the n-th moment measure is the expectation of the n-th power of some point process. The \\\\textstyle n\\\\,th moment measure of a point process \\\\textstyle {N} is equivalently defined as: : \\\\int_{\\\\textbf{R}^{n d}}f(x_1,\\\\dots,x_n) M^n(dx_1,\\\\dots,dx_n)=E \\\\left[ \\\\sum_{(x_1,\\\\dots,x_n)\\\\in {N} } f(x_1,\\\\dots,x_n) \\\\right], where \\\\textstyle f is any non-negative measurable function on \\\\textstyle \\\\textbf{R}^{n d} and the sum is over \\\\textstyle n-tuples of points for which repetition is allowed. First moment measure For some Borel set B, the first moment of a point process N is: : M^1(B)=E [{N}(B)], where \\\\textstyle M^1 is known, among other terms, as the intensity measure or mean measure,J. F. C. Kingman. Poisson processes, volume 3. Oxford university press, 1992. and is interpreted as the expected or average number of points of \\\\textstyle {N} found or located in the set \\\\textstyle B. Second moment measure The second moment measure for two Borel sets \\\\textstyle A and \\\\textstyle B is: : M^2(A\\\\times B)=E [{N}(A){N}(B)], which for a single Borel set \\\\textstyle B becomes : M^2(B\\\\times B)=(E [{N}(B)])^2+\\\\text{Var}[{N}(B)], where \\\\textstyle \\\\text{Var}[{N}(B)] denotes the variance of the random variable \\\\textstyle {N}(B). The previous variance term alludes to how moments measures, like moments of random variables, can be used to calculate quantities like the variance of point processes. A further example is the covariance of a point process \\\\textstyle {N} for two Borel sets \\\\textstyle A and \\\\textstyle B, which is given by: : \\\\text{Cov}[{N}(A),{N}(B)]=M^2(A\\\\times B)-M^1(A)M^1(B) Example: Poisson point process For a general Poisson point process with intensity measure \\\\textstyle \\\\Lambda the first moment measure is: : M^1(B)=\\\\Lambda(B), which for a homogeneous Poisson point process with constant intensity \\\\textstyle \\\\lambda means: : M^1(B)=\\\\lambdaB, where \\\\textstyle B is the length, area or volume (or more generally, the Lebesgue measure) of \\\\textstyle B. For the Poisson case with measure \\\\textstyle \\\\Lambda the second moment measure defined on the product set (B \\\\times B) is: : M^2(B \\\\times B)=\\\\Lambda(B)+\\\\Lambda(B)^2. which in the homogeneous case reduces to : M^2(B \\\\times B)=\\\\lambdaB+(\\\\lambdaB)^2.

He debuted with ‚ÄúEvacuation,‚Äù a story revolving around existential angst towards the military and the medical condition Meniere's syndrome. In Labyrinth he depicts how free exploration of paths in life can become closed down. These early works are heavily existential, and focus on issues of human existence within the confines of coarse daily life. The best work of his classical phase, when he was consciously working on the formal aesthetics of the short story is A River. This story recounts the predictable beats of a pointless and lonely life in a world that denies the dream of beauty. Though diverse in subject matter, Lee's works share the underlying concern with growing insensitivity to violence and change in modern society and our indifference to the suffering of others. Over the years, however, the sharply critical tone of his works has grown relatively mild. The Color of Water, the Pattern of That Shade published in 1996 marks a point of change in the author's perspective from cold and analytical to warm and compassionate. The Color of Water, the Pattern of That Shade is a moving story of family hardships and maternal love which also explores the negative side-effects of rapid industrialization.\\"ÏÑúÏ†ïÏù∏\\" biographical PDF available at LTI Korea Library or online at: http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do# Works in Translation * D√©fil√© (Î∂ÑÏó¥Ïãù) Works in Korean (Partial) Short Stories * \\"Our Neighborhood‚Äù (Uri dongne, 1971) * ‚ÄúThe Road to Geumsan Temple‚Äù (Geumsansa ganeun gil, 1974) * ‚ÄúIn the Heart of Nammun‚Äù (Nammun tong, 1975) * ‚ÄúScissors/ Nightmare‚Äù (Gawi, 1976) * ‚ÄúWinter‚Äôs Wanderer‚Äù (Gyeoul nageune, 1976) * ‚ÄúThe Appointment‚Äù (Yaksok, 1976), ‚ÄúAn Outing‚Äù (Nadeuri, 1977) * ‚ÄúThe Shade of a Pavilion‚Äù (Jeongja geuneul, 1977) * ‚ÄúBetween Saturday and Friday‚Äù (Toyoilgwa geumyoil sai, 1980).

Staples, and his Malayan chauffeur as part of a convoy that included an armored scout car, a police wireless van, and a land rover with six Malayan policemen sitting in its open back. Eight miles from the ambush site, the wireless van developed engine trouble, and the commander advised Gurney to wait, but Gurney decided to press ahead with the rest of the convoy. About north of Kuala Lumpur, as the convoy rounded a curve in the road, it was ambushed by a force of 38 Malayan Communist Party guerrillas, who opened fire on the convoy with three Bren guns, Sten guns, and rifles. Gurney and five of the six Malayan policemen in the land rover were wounded, and his chauffeur killed. Both vehicles came to a halt as bullets punctured their tyres. Gurney pushed his wife and private secretary into the footwell of the car, then got out and staggered forward towards the ambush site to draw the insurgents' fire away from the car and towards himself. The guerrillas fired in his direction, fatally hitting him. The armored scout car pushed ahead of the Rolls-Royce with some difficulty to get help from a nearby police station. The insurgents stayed in the area for about ten more minutes, firing intermittently at anything that moved. A bugle call then sounded, and the insurgents pulled back. When the firing eased, Lady Gurney crawled out of the Rolls Royce, only to discover her husband's body lying in a roadside ditch. Twenty minutes later, the officer in charge of the armored scout car arrived at the scene with reinforcements from the police station.Grob-Fitzgibbon, Benjamin: Imperial Endgame: Britain's Dirty Wars and the End of Empire.Telegram from Chief Secretary del Tufo of the Malayan Government to Colonial Secretary Griffiths According to Communist leader Chin Peng, the ambush was routine, the killing by chance, and the guerrillas only learned the High Commissioner was among the dead from news reports.Chin Peng, My Side of History, Media Masters, Singapore, 2003, pp. 287-289.

Education and career  Born in Moscow, Kopnin earned a master's degree in physics in 1970 from Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology and a PhD in physics and mathematics in 1973 from the Landau Institute for Theoretical Physics, where his supervisor was Lev P. Gor‚Äôkov; his dissertation was on vortices in Type II superconductors. He remained at the Landau Institute as a researcher and in 1984 was awarded a higher doctorate and became a Leading Research Fellow. From 1988 to 1994 he was a professor of physics at Moscow State Institute of Radio Engineering, Electronics and Automation. In 2000 he joined the faculty of the Low Temperature Laboratory at the Helsinki University of Technology in Finland, now Aalto University. He was also a visiting professor at, among others, CNRS in Grenoble and the University of Paris-Sud in France, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel, and the University of Chicago and the Argonne National Laboratory in the USA.  Research  Kopnin's primary research area was superconductivity, in particular non-equilibrium and non- stationary phenomena. One of the forces acting on quantum vortices in superfluids and superconductors is known as the \\"Kopnin force\\" after him. In 1991, by extending his theory concerning this force to chiral superfluids, he predicted the existence of fermionic bound states, quasiparticles now known as Majorana fermions and that it may be possible to observe in topological superfluids and superconductors. He contributed to the studies of anisotropic and layered superconductors and developed the microscopic theories for dissipative and non-stationary flow in Fermi superfluids. His 2001 monograph Theory of Nonequilibrium Superconductivity has been widely cited. He published more than 150 articles in international journals.  Honors  In 2011, with his Landau colleague S.V.

Originally from Port Elizabeth, Fuller migrated as a child to Melbourne with her family. There she trained with her uncle Robert Hawker Dowling and teacher Jane Sutherland and took classes at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School, becoming a professional artist in the late 1880s. In 1892 she left Australia, travelling first to South Africa, where she met and painted for Cecil Rhodes, and then on to Europe. She lived and studied there for the subsequent decade, except for a return to South Africa in 1899 to paint a portrait of Rhodes. Between 1895 and 1904 her works were exhibited at the Paris Salon and London's Royal Academy. In 1904, Fuller returned to Australia, living in Perth. She became active in the Theosophical Society and painted some of her best-known work, including A Golden Hour, described by the National Gallery of Australia as a \\"masterpiece\\" when it acquired the work in 2013. Beginning in 1908, Fuller travelled extensively, living in India and England before ultimately settling in Sydney. There, she was the inaugural teacher of life drawing at the School of Fine and Applied Arts, established in 1920 by the New South Wales Society of Women Painters. She died in 1946. Highly regarded during her active career as a portrait and landscape painter, by 1914 Fuller was represented in four public galleries‚Äîthree in Australia and one in South Africa‚Äîa record for a woman who was an Australian painter at that time. In 1927 she began almost twenty years of institutionalization in a mental asylum, however, and her death went without notice. After her death, information about her was frequently omitted from reference books about Australian painters and knowledge of her work became obscure despite her paintings being held in public art collections including the Art Gallery of South Australia, the Art Gallery of Western Australia, the National Gallery of Australia, the National Gallery of Victoria, the Art Gallery of New South Wales and Australia's National Portrait Gallery. Early life and career Florence Fuller was born in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, in 1867, a daughter of Louisa and John Hobson Fuller. She had several siblings, including sisters Amy and Christie, both of whom subsequently became singers. The family migrated to Australia when Florence was a child. She worked as a governess while undertaking studies in art, and first took classes at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School in 1883, then again for a further term of study in 1888. During this period she was a student of Jane Sutherland, referred to in the Australian Dictionary of Biography as \\"the leading female artist in the group of Melbourne painters who broke with the nineteenth-century tradition of studio art by sketching and painting directly from nature\\". Fuller's uncle was Robert Hawker Dowling, a painter of orientalist and Aboriginal subjects, as well as portraits and miniatures. British-born, he had grown up in Tasmania and made a living there as a portraitist, before returning to his native England at age thirty. For the next two decades, his works were frequently hung at the Royal Academy. He returned to Australia in 1885, and Fuller became his pupil. In that year, aged eighteen, Fuller received a commission from Ann Fraser Bon, philanthropist and supporter of Victoria's Aboriginal people. The commission was for Barak‚Äìlast chief of the Yarra Yarra Tribe of Aborigines, a formal oil on canvas portrait of the Indigenous Australian leader, William Barak. Ultimately, that painting was acquired by the State Library of Victoria. Although the painting is an important work regularly used to illustrate this significant figure in Australia's history, interpretations of Fuller's portrait are mixed: one critic noted the painting's objectivity and avoidance of romanticising Aboriginal people, while another concluded that \\"Fuller is painting an ideal rather than a person\\". Weary, 1888 In 1886, Dowling returned to his native England. Giving up her work as a governess, Fuller began to paint full-time, and had opened her own studio before she had turned twenty. Dowling had intended to return to Australia and had left behind an incomplete portrait of the Victorian governor's wife, Lady Loch. He died, however, not long after arriving in England; Fuller then completed Dowling's commission. Lady Loch became her patron. Other early portraits followed: two pictures of homeless children, entitled Weary (inspired by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's poem on child labour \\"Weariness\\") and Desolate, in 1888; and Gently Reproachful circa 1889. Weary was acquired by the Art Gallery of New South Wales in 2015. The gallery's curator of Australian art described the depiction of billboard posters in the painting as giving it a \\"sense of gritty realism that was arguably unprecedented in Australian art.\\" Also in 1889, Fuller was awarded a prize by the Victorian Artists Society for best portrait by an artist under twenty-five. Europe and South Africa Inseparables, circa 1900 In 1892, Fuller travelled to the Cape of Good Hope \\"to convalesce\\", although from what illness or injury, her biographer Joan Kerr does not say. While there, she was a guest of her uncle Sir Thomas Ekins Fuller, a member of the Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope, and through him she met Cecil Rhodes, the Colony's Prime Minister, who commissioned her to paint a landscape showing his home. Two years later, she travelled on to England and France, where she remained for a decade. In the 1890s, Australian artists studying abroad favoured Paris over London, and Fuller was no exception. Other Australians studying in France around that time included Agnes Goodsir, Margaret Preston, James Quinn, and Hugh Ramsay. Fuller studied first at the Acad√©mie Julian, where her teachers included William-Adolphe Bouguereau, and later, Rapha√´l Collin, for whom she was head of studio. Many of the French art schools had only recently opened their doors to women, and those at Acad√©mie Julian experienced poor, overcrowded conditions and contempt from the (mostly male) teachers. Despite this, Fuller's skills developed, and contemporary critics commented favourably on the influence of the French training. During her time in Europe, Fuller had great success. After a pastel portrait of hers was accepted for the Paris Salon in 1895, two of her paintings were shown there in 1896. That was followed by another, La Glaneuse, in 1897, in which year she also had a work accepted by the Royal Academy in London. She exhibited in many other locations: the Royal Institute of Oil Painters and Manchester Art Gallery in England, as well as the Victorian Artists Society and the New South Wales Society of Artists, and at the Melbourne studio of Jane Sutherland. There was even a painting, Landscape, hung in the exhibition for the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of Bendigo. Not all her time was spent in Europe, however; in 1899 she returned to South Africa to paint Cecil Rhodes. One source suggests that she ultimately prepared five portraits of the founder of Rhodesia. A later newspaper report stated that Fuller also travelled and made sketches in Wales, Ireland, and Italy. While in Europe, Fuller painted Inseparables, which portrays the figure of a girl sitting reading a book. It was acquired by the Art Gallery of South Australia. When hanging the work as part of its exhibition The Edwardians, the National Gallery of Australia described the painting as one suggesting a love of reading. In contrast, art historian Catherine Speck regarded the work as \\"subversive\\" because of its portrayal of a young woman \\"gaining knowledge\\". In November 1902, the Australian Federal International Exhibition was held. It was opened by the Governor of Victoria Sir George Clarke, who spoke of its goal to advance \\"the industrial progress of Australia\\". The event occupied the entire Royal Exhibition Building in Melbourne, and was dominated by an exhibition of art, both Australian and international. Included in this extensive survey of painting were six works by Fuller. Perth A Golden Hour, 1905 Portrait of Deborah Vernon Hackett, circa 1908 Further recognition came with the hanging of one of Fuller's paintings, Summer Breezes, at the Royal Academy in 1904. Other Australian artists whose works were hung at the same time included Rupert Bunny, E. Phillips Fox, Albert Fullwood, George Lambert, and Arthur Streeton. Fuller was the only woman painter to be represented. A critic writing in The West Australian observed: > The work ... is essentially Australian in almost every detail. Standing in a > sunlit Australian paddock, a lithesome Australian blonde holds her summer > hat on against the rude caresses of an Australian breeze‚Äîa subject simple > but grand in its simplicity ... Next to its suggestion of breezy sunshine > and the incidental portrayal of willowy grace the picture is to be admired > for its colour scheme ... The details of the picture disclose untiring care. By the time Summer Breezes was on display, Fuller had returned to Australia, not to her previous home in Melbourne but to Perth in Western Australia, where she joined her sister, Amy Fuller, who was a singer. Although only in her mid- thirties, Fuller's background made her \\"one of the most experienced artists in Western Australia at this time\\". For the next four years, she painted portraits, including one of Western Australian politician James George Lee Steere, undertaken posthumously from photographs and recollections of those who had known him. It was acquired by the gallery whose board he chaired. She also took on students, including French-Australian artist Kathleen O'Connor. Fuller's paintings from this period included A Golden Hour, described by the National Gallery of Australia as \\"a masterpiece ... giving us a gentle insight into the people, places and times that make up our history\\". The painting, an oil on canvas high and wide, portrays a woman and a man standing together in a rural setting in late afternoon, surrounded by grass, scattered gum trees, and Xanthorrhoea. When the painting was put up for sale in 2012, the auction house catalogue stated that it had been owned by William Ride, former director of the Western Australian Museum. It reported: > The current owners assert that Professor Ride always understood the figures > in the picture were Sir John Winthrop Hackett, (then owner of The West > Australian newspaper, well known business man and philanthropist, whose gift > allowed the construction of the impressive University of Western Australia > buildings and St. George's Residential College) and his new wife, Deborah > Vernon Hackett\\". In addition to appearing as the small figure of a woman in A Golden Hour, Deborah Vernon Hackett was also the subject of a portrait, painted around 1908, again during Fuller's time in Perth. Anne Gray, the head of Australian art at the National Gallery of Australia, observed of Fuller's approach to the newspaperman's wife, that: > Fuller portrayed her sitter sympathetically, capturing the young woman's > grace and charm. But she also conveyed the complexity of the young Mrs > Hackett's character through her soft, feminine, pale-blue dress > counterpoised by the dramatic black hat and direct gaze. Fuller painted other works for the Hacketts. In a 1937 piece reflecting on early twentieth-century art in Western Australia, a reviewer recalled: > Dr. (later Sir Winthrop) Hackett was a great patron of Miss Fuller, and he > was a constant visitor to her dignified studio, above his office in the old > West Australian Chambers. The first portrait I saw Miss Fuller working on > was of Mrs. E. Chase ... The portrait was a commission from Dr. Hackett, and > was destined to hang in his gallery. Miss Fuller painted Lady Hackett both > before and after her marriage, and one particularly happy picture of her is > as a young girl gathering wildflowers in the Darlington hills. Her portraits > of the first Hackett babies were charming studies of childhood. Theosophy and later career Biographer Joan Kerr speculated that it may have been Jane Sutherland who introduced Fuller to Theosophy, a spiritual and mystical philosophy that teaches the unity of existence and emphasises the search for universal wisdom. Described by art historian Jenny McFarlane as \\"the most important counter-cultural organisation of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries\\", it was influential throughout Fuller's life. Fuller, one of numerous Australian artists who became theosophists, including Violet Teague, Vida Lahey and Ethel Carrick, joined the society in Perth on 29 May 1905, after hearing charismatic theosophist Charles Webster Leadbeater during his lecture tour. Bessie Rischbieth was a feminist who joined at the same time, and together they influenced the movement's development in early twentieth century Perth. Fuller was variously secretary, treasurer, and librarian of the local branch of the Theosophical Society. Fuller had a studio in Perth, first at St Georges Terrace and later in the premises of The West Australian, and the Society used these for their meetings. In 1906 Fuller's portrait of feminist and theosophist Annie Besant was among the paintings exhibited at the West Australian Art Society's annual exhibition. Around the same period, she painted other portraits of the movement's leading figures, including Henry Steel Olcott and Helena Petrovna Blavatsky. These representations departed from the academic portraiture in which Fuller had trained, as she incorporated practices of intuition and visualisation \\"inspired by Indian aesthetics as mediated by the Theosophical Society\\". In 1907, Besant became the president of the Theosophical Society globally, and set to work with a major expansion of the organisation's headquarters at Adyar, in what was then Madras. When it was announced that Besant would undertake a speaking tour of Australia in 1908, she was expected to stay with Fuller while in Perth. Some months later in 1908, Fuller left Western Australia and travelled to India, staying at Adyar. Of her time in India, Fuller wrote: > I went in search not only of beauty, and light, and colour, and the > picturesqueness in general, which delight the eye and emotions of all > artists‚Äîbut of something deeper‚Äîsomething less easily expressed. I spent two > and a half years in a community that is quite unique‚Äîperhaps the most > cosmopolitan settlement in the world‚Äîthe headquarters of the Theosophical > Society ... Well, I painted there, of course, but my art was undergoing a > change, and I felt that it could not satisfy me unless it became so much > greater. Fuller's time at Adyar was eventful. Leadbeater arrived around the same time as Fuller, and soon afterward he \\"discovered\\" the person he believed would become a global teacher and orator, Jiddu Krishnamurti (then in his teens). Leadbetter and others tutored Krishnamurti. Fuller may have taught him photography. She also had a small studio built in the grounds, and painted. Her works from the period include a portrait of Leadbeater and Portrait of the Lord Buddha. McFarlane emphasises the significance of the latter work, pointing out that it is \\"strikingly modern\\" in comparison to all of Fuller's other work, and more radical than compositions created by Grace Cossington Smith and Roland Wakelin, half a decade later. The painting owes much to theosophy's emphasis on seeing the subject \\"through a psychic, visionary experience\\". Fuller faced the challenge of reconciling her academic, European artistic training with the spiritual and philosophical priorities of theosophical thought. Her portrait of Leadbeater, painted in 1910, shows her in that transition. Fuller drew on the work of contemporary Indian artists of the Bengal School of Art, and the writings of art historian Ernest Havell and philosopher Ananda Coomaraswamy to \\"find the formal strategies that she needed\\" to produce the kind of art to which she was committed. While this changed her technique at Adyar, her later works did not continue this radical stylistic departure, instead being produced \\"to please a market comfortable with conventional portraiture\\". Sources describing Fuller's movements after her time in India sometimes are ambiguous. She arrived in England in June 1911, where she marched with Besant in the suffragette protests associated with the coronation of George V. She continued to paint portraits, but found it difficult to realise the transformation in her art that she had conceptualised in India: > I have painted a great many portraits since I have been in England, and have > been, I suppose, fairly successful‚Äîthough I have done nothing in any way > remarkable. The hidden inner life has not yet succeeded in expressing itself > on canvas, and I can only write myself as one who aspires to a greater art, > but who has not yet achieved. Fuller subsequently travelled from London to India in 1914. One newspaper report described her as a \\"visitor\\" to Sydney in 1916, although McFarlane says she travelled there with Leadbeater and remained in the city. During that visit, she held an exhibition of her miniatures, all of them portraits of theosophists including Besant and Henry Olcott, co-founder of the Theosophical Society. She visited Brisbane in 1917. Fuller spent a period painting in Java (at that time part of the Dutch East Indies), although when this occurred is not clear: MacFarlane says she was there with Leadbeater, painting while he was giving lectures. There was at least one subsequent substantial journey, as Fuller arrived again to Sydney, via Perth, from India in 1919. At some point following these travels, Fuller settled permanently in Mosman in Sydney's northern suburbs, where she continued to paint, including miniatures. In 1920, the Society of Women Painters in New South Wales established a School of Fine and Applied Arts, with Florence Fuller appointed as the inaugural teacher of life classes. At the exhibition held to mark the school's establishment, Fuller displayed a portrait of the organisation's founder, Mrs Hedley Parsons. When the society held a show in 1926, a portrait by Fuller was one of those selected for favourable comment, but the general opinion of The Sydney Morning Herald reviewer was that \\"the exhibitors have let their style harden into a groove\\". Fuller continued to be associated with the theosophical community as her health and economic circumstances deteriorated. In 1927, at the age of sixty, she was committed to Gladesville Mental Asylum (as it was then known), where she died nearly two decades later, on 17 July 1946. She was buried at Rookwood Cemetery. Florence Fuller Street in the Canberra suburb of Conder is named in her honour.

Retrieved 30 September 2020. Gwenda Robb and Elaine Smith, in their Concise Dictionary of Australian Artists, considered Fuller's art to be created in \\"a free painterly style indebted to Impressionism\\". During the first decade of the twentieth century, reviews drew attention to her distinctively Australian style. When one of Fuller's works was included in an exhibition of colonial artists in London (including paintings from Canada and Australia), the correspondent from the Adelaide Advertiser described Fuller's contribution as \\"most Australian in feeling\\". Reviewing her work hung in the Royal Academy in 1904, a Perth critic reported: \\"Of the 16 or 17 Australian artists exhibiting at the Academy, Miss Fuller was the only one who chose a typically Australian scene. Her picture shows a young girl in thin white, clinging, dress, standing on a bushy piece of country ... As the London Observer says, the atmosphere that bathes the graceful figure of the girl is capitally managed with its note of subtropical heat\\". One reviewer thought very highly of her portraits, but was less convinced about Fuller's approach to the Australian light, writing: > She had less success with our landscapes than with her figure subjects. That > was the result of her passion for toning her pictures for ultimate indoor > hanging. Thereby she lost, or illuminated, the hard Australian, hard light > and shade, and startling relative values.

Reviewing the Western Australian Art Society's exhibition in 1906, the critic for Perth's Western Mail considered Fuller's works to be the finest on show, and that \\"the occasion provides another triumph for Miss Fuller\\". Art critic and curator Jenny McFarlane considered Fuller's work to be complex, drawing not only on European modernist academic traditions and Australian subjects, but also at times, incorporating \\"radical stylistic innovations\\" that drew on Indian artistic tradition and theosophy's ideas. Fuller's style and choice of subject were strongly influenced by the theory and practice of the theosophy movement. Compared to her earlier works, portraits painted at Adyar showed a reduced tonal range and a shift from academic portraiture to representation of the 'hidden inner life' of the subject. In Portrait of the Lord Buddha, she worked with a colour palette reflecting theosophy's attribution of specific meanings to colours and used little tonal variation. In 1914, it was reported that Fuller was represented in four public galleries‚Äîthree in Australia and one in South Africa‚Äîa record for an Australian woman painter at that time. Yet although she experienced considerable success during her early life, Fuller subsequently became almost invisible. No obituaries appeared in the newspapers in 1946. She is not mentioned at all in Janine Burke's Australian Women Artists 1840‚Äì1940, Max Germaine's Dictionary of Women Artists in Australia, nor Caroline Ambrus's Australian Women Artists. However her work toured with the Completing the picture: women artists and the Heidelberg era exhibition in 1992-1993 and also was discussed in detail and illustrated in Janda Gooding's Western Australian art and artists, 1900-1950 exhibition and publication. In 2013, Ann Gray described Fuller as \\"an important Australian woman artist and arguably Western Australia's most significant artist from the Federation period\\". Works by Fuller are held by the Art Gallery of South Australia, the Art Gallery of Western Australia, the National Gallery of Australia, the City of Perth, the National Gallery of Victoria, Australia's National Portrait Gallery, the Art Gallery of New South Wales and the State Library of Victoria. Internationally, her work is held by the Newport Museum and Art Gallery in South Wales.

At the other end it was proposed to appoint a London agency to be entrusted with the business of seeing to the disposal and proper marketing of New Zealand meat in England (Smithfield). Funding was provided by a small per carcass levy paid by producers. The government was empowered by the Act to prohibit the export of meat except as determined by the Board. The organisation was called New Zealand Meat Producers Board from its inception in 1922 until March 1998, when Meat New Zealand was used as its trading name. Through the Meat Board Act 2004, the name changed to its current name, New Zealand Meat Board, in July 2004.

Seo, whose given name is Seo Deoksun, writes under the pen name of Seo Hajin. Her father held considerable power during the military regime of the 1980s as the Prosecutor General and director general of the National Security Planning Agency (NSPA). Although she rejected her father's extreme right-wing ideological leanings, Seo recalls her childhood and adolescence as being relatively conflict-free with no instance of rebellious behavior. However, despite her outward obedience, she confesses to having a dark side to her nature, and claims her closest friends were her aunt's books; these books ultimately formed Seo's desire to become a writer. Seo debuted in the journal Hyeondae Munhak (Contemporary Literature) in 1994 with her short story A Shadow Outing.\\"Seo Hajin\\" LTI Korea Datasheet available at LTI Korea Library or online at: http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do# Work Seo has attempted to explain feminine desire and challenge the patriarchal nature of Korean society and its customs. Seo debuted in the journal Hyeondae Munhak (Contemporary Literature) in 1994 with her short story ‚ÄúA Shadow Outing.‚Äù In 1995, she began to receive more widespread attention with her story ‚ÄúTidal Path,‚Äù which has as its backdrop a mysterious island connected to land by a path that disappears and reappears with the changing of the tide.

The 243rd episode of the series overall, it first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on November 6, 2013. In the episode, Cartman modifies a cow to make it look like a ginger as a joke. However, various religious groups see this as a prophecy being fulfilled and peace is brought to the Middle East. Plot At South Park Elementary, Eric Cartman announces that he wishes to apologize to Kyle Broflovski, saying that Kyle was correct the previous day when he told Cartman that humans are not the only animals that can have light skin and freckles. Telling them that he has discovered a ginger cow, Cartman takes his classmates to a nearby farm, where he shows them a cow that has been given a red wig and painted white with giant red \\"freckles\\". Though Kyle sees through this obvious prank, Cartman insists to his credulous classmates that it is real. News of the cow spreads across the globe and is widely interpreted as the fulfillment of a Biblical prophecy regarding a red heifer that signals the end times, prompting mass suicides. Kyle is then called to Mr. Mackey's office, where he is introduced to three Israeli rabbis, who explain the prophecy to him. Kyle tries to convince them that the red heifer is a forgery on Cartman's part, but the farm where the cow is located becomes a pilgrimage site where large numbers of Jews, Muslims, and Christians congregate, each claiming the cow for their respective religions. However, when the three religious sects meet to plan Armageddon, they realize that they are negotiating in a civil manner and that the prophecy may have meant that the cow would signal the end of war, and not the end of the world. The congregants then agree to sacrifice the cow in order to fulfill the prophecy. Peace is achieved in the Middle East among the three Abrahamic religions, who morph the cross, Star of David, and Islamic crescent moon into a new unifying symbol‚Äîthe logo of the band Van Halen, which appears on a stage to commence a 10-year concert in Israel. Cartman then appears at Kyle's house and admits that the cow was a forgery and states that he intends to admit this publicly. Realizing that this revelation may ruin the interfaith peace that the forgery achieved, Kyle asks him not to. Cartman agrees to withhold this information, on condition that Kyle do everything that Cartman says, which includes indignities such as insulting his own mother Sheila to her face, performing menial tasks and humiliating himself in public by allowing Cartman to fart in his face and claiming that he enjoys it. Kyle, who is conflicted over the morality of the deception, experiences a vision of a spirit that praises his sacrifice and compels him to shave his head. However, Stan Marsh becomes a critical person to Kyle, telling him that while publicly claiming to like Cartman's farts is his prerogative, the self- righteous manner that he has adopted when doing so is not. Kyle is unmoved, and Stan, noting that Kyle's odd behavior began with the peace in the Middle East, seeks to investigate. Kyle and Cartman travel to Israel, where Cartman intends to further humiliate Kyle by having him endure his farts and claim to enjoy it on a stage before thousands of people. Their demonstration is interrupted, however, by a broadcast hosted by Anderson Cooper, in which Stan intends to expose the truth about Cartman's red cow. Kyle, speaking to Stan privately by cell phone, explains why he has been enduring Cartman's abuse and convinces Stan not to expose the truth, in order to preserve the new peace. Acquiescing to this, Stan instead announces in the broadcast that he saw the cow descend miraculously from heaven. However, the prophecy stated that a fat child with a small penis would disguise a cow to look ginger, not that one would just miraculously fall from the sky. The short-lived peace among the three religions falls apart. Kyle, realizing that the prophecy really has occurred, tries to convince the rabbis that this is precisely what happened, but Cartman (insulted at his penis size in the prophecy) refuses to corroborate this, claiming, \\"I have a huge dick.\\" The episode ends with Cartman farting one last time on a crestfallen Kyle. Production On the DVD commentary for the episode, South Park co-creator Matt Stone revealed that the story was inspired by material he had read on the red heifer's prominence in the Abrahamic religions, which lent itself to the story on how peace is achieved in the Middle East. Parker and Stone felt that, in hindsight, the episode should have been a two-part storyline, explaining that the premise could have been mined for further development, perhaps even for a feature film. They were forced to cut a lot of content to condense the episode to the standard runtime of around twenty-one minutes. Reception Max Nicholson of IGN gave the episode a score of 7.5 out of 10, stating that it \\"touches on some great ideas that would have benefited from more time.\\" Ryan McGee of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+ rating, stating, \\"'Ginger Cow' comes very close to utterly succeeding on several occasions, but ultimately settles for being fascinating. There are some great ideas here that no amount of screen time would ever sufficiently answer. But those ideas still needed more screen time to sufficiently debate. Still, in a season as subpar as this has been, it‚Äôs heartening to see the show can still recapture some of its past heights this late in the game.\\" ReferencesExternal links *\\"Ginger Cow\\" Full episode at South Park Studios. * * Category:Television episodes about religion Category:Jewish comedy and humor Category:South Park (season 17) episodes Category:Television episodes about suicide Category:Van Halen ","title":"Ginger Cow"},{"id":"40969480","text":"A Day for a Miracle (, ) is a 2011 film directed by Andreas Prochaska in 2011 and produced by Rowboat Film- und Fernsehproduktion and Graf Film for public German TV channel ZDF and Austrian ORF.

Only one was constructed. Development The single example of the Parma glider, one of many glider designs from Adriano Mantelli, was built in 1947 in the workshops of Mantelli's Alaparma SpA by Emilio Pastorelli during his spare time. It was intended to be light, simple and cheap to build and easy to transport, whilst flying well in thermals. It had a cantilever high wing mounted on top of its fuselage and constructed in one piece to keep the weight very low. The wing had a single spar, with plywood skin forward around the leading edge forming a torsion- resistant D-box. In plan the wing was rectangular with rounded tips. The Parma had an smoothly plywood skinned, oval cross-section fuselage, with its cockpit under the wing leading edge and enclosed by a single piece transparency. The fuselage tapered rearwards, where a straight edged, round tipped tailplane mounted on top of the fuselage carried elevators with a cut-out for rudder movement. The fin and rudder were rounded, the latter of broad chord and reaching down to the keel. The glider landed on a sprung skid reaching from the nose almost to the wing trailing edge, assisted by a small tail bumper. Mantelli flew his glider on its first flight in 1947, aerotowed by the AM-9, a two-seat motor-glider and another of his designs. The Parma proved to be a useful trainer and could use weak thermals; it could also, despite its single piece wing, be transported behind a bicycle. To remove the wing for transport required the removal of just three bolts.

Two of his best known prints, Snow in Springtime (1919) and The Giant Stride (1918) are from this period. Towards the end of World War I, he served in the Royal Army Service Corps. Teaching career After the war Platt exhibited at the New English Art Club, for the British Council and in 1922 won a gold medal at the International Print Makers' Exhibition organised by the California Society of Printmakers. As well as designing several posters for London Underground, he continued to teach. Platt taught at the Harrogate School of Art throughout 1919, the Derby School of Art in 1920 and was Head of the Department of Fine Art at Edinburgh College of Art between 1920 and 1923, before becoming Principal of the Leicester School of Art from 1923 until 1929, when he moved to London to become head of Blackheath School of Art.

The main site in which Hacienda Grande culture was studied was in Lo√≠za. Similar to the Saladoid culture, out of Venezuela, the Hacienda Grande culture was known primarily for its ceramic works. Ceramic techniques include vessel forms, such as zoomorphic effigy vessels, platters, jars and bowls with D-shaped strap handles, and many other types of vessels. These potters decorated their vessels with polychrome designs mainly utilizing white-on-red, black paint, and negative-painted designs. These pottery findings, which are considered some of the best in Puerto Rico, represent the \\"earliest immigration of pottery-making Indians into the island.\\" Similar 'white-on-red' pottery has been found in the Virgin Islands, the Lesser Antilles, Trinidad, and the Orinoco region of Venezuela. Though much of what we know about this culture is based on their ceramics, we do know that a principal part of not only their diet, but their society, was crab. The fact that an abundance of crab remains were discovered along with the pottery, combined with the fact that shell and shell artifacts are so rare, points directly to this site corresponding with what Froelich Rainey called \\"Crab culture.\\" Though this distinct style of pottery was found elsewhere, it did not travel any farther north or west than Puerto Rico. Evidence suggests that the Igneri immigration into the Greater Antilles was stopped due to a new group of invaders from South America. This theory is further supported by the fact that, rather than a slow shift from one ceramic style to another, the Hacienda Grande style of pottery and a diet based almost entirely on crabmeat abruptly stops, and with it, the Hacienda Grande culture as a whole.

Mathambo rose to fame in the late 2000s with his fusion of a wide array of musical influences. He is known for coining the term ‚ÄòTownship Tech‚Äô, to describe his sound. Early life Mathambo hails from the township Rockville in Soweto, a township at the outskirts of Johannesburg. The trombonist Jonas Gwangwa is his uncle. Born in 1985, Mathambo grew up during the state of emergency in the final years of Apartheid. In the mid 1990s his family moved to Sandown an affluent suburb in Sandton, north of Johannesburg, where Mathambo attended St John's College, Johannesburg. As a teenager Mathambo showed an interest in creative writing and music, both of which he kept practicing while first studying medicine at the University of Cape Town and later studying graphic design. In Cape Town he became immersed in the local rap and electronic music scene where he gave his first gigs. Here, he also began to collaborate with Waddy Jones (later Die Antwoord), producer Simon Ringrose (known as SiBot) and Markus Wormstorm. The name Spoek Mathambo is derived from the South African sit-com Emzini Wezinsizwa which Mokgata liked to watch as a child. 'Spoek' translates as ghost in Afrikaans, 'Mathambo' as bones or skeleton in isiZulu. Together, the name translates as something like 'Ghost of Bones' or 'Ghost Skeleton'. Career=2006-2010: early projects Sweat.X and Playdoe In 2006, Mathambo and Wormstorm started their electro rap-duo project Sweat.X and quickly rose to national prominence by releasing various mixes on their MySpace site. A year later, they signed to UK label Citinite, released their debut EP Ebonyivorytron and toured Europe. Another of Mathambo's projects in the late 2000s was the duo Playdoe with SiBot (Simon Ringrose). Their debut mini-album It's That Beat was released in 2008 at label Try Harder and followed by a tour through Europe. The same year, they released the album Sibot & Spoek are Playdoe followed in 2010 by the EP African Arcade, both with label Jarring Effects. Another album with the title Bubble & Freeze was released on Leonizer Records in 2010. Together with Starkey they released the EP Freeze Step in 2009. 2010-2011: Mshini Wam A series of mixtapes titled H.I.V.I.P., periodically released on his blog in 2009, helped build Mathambo's reputation for creatively arranging different styles and genres. Mathambo's collaboration with Richard Rumney aka. Richard The Third called Moleke Mbembe eventually developed into a live band supporting Mathambo on his first album. In 2010, Mathambo's debut solo album Mshini Wam was released on Stockholm label BBE Records.May 2012. \\"Spoek Mathambo: The Ghost In The Pop Machine Goes Global\\", Rolling Stone South Africa. The title is derived from \\"Umshini Wami\\", which translates as ‚ÄòBring me my machine gun‚Äô, an anti- apartheid struggle song popular with Umkhonto we Sizwe, the armed wing of the African National Congress, in the 1960s. It was also Jacob Zuma's signature song in his bid for power in the late 2000s. Regarding the album's title, Mathambo stated: \\"My Machine in this case ‚Ä¶ is my platform to express a new wave of electronic African music blowing through the continent!\\" The album includes the widely acclaimed song Control, a cover of Joy Division‚Äôs \\"She's Lost Control\\". The track's video was directed by South African photographer Pieter Hugo and Michael Cleary, who received the Young Director Award at the 2011 Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity. The video also won the Gold Award at the South African Lories in 2011. Meanwhile, Mathambo was nominated in the Best African Act category for the 2011 MOBO Awards. In September 2011, he gave a presentation ad TEDxSoweto.  2012: Father Creeper & Future Sound of Mzansi  In 2012 Mathambo moved to Seattle label Sub Pop and release his second album Father Creeper. It received four star reviews by The Guardian, Mojo and Q.\\"Father Creeper Critic Reviews\\". Metacritic. Retrieved 2 March 2018 Father Creeper gained him a second nomination for Best African Act at the 2012 MOBO Awards. Unlike its computerised predecessor, Father Creeper also contains live arrangements. For this, Mathambo collaborated with many artists and reviews described Mathambos music as a juxtaposing meltdown of styles that transcend even his own self-prescribed label of 'Township Tech'. Later that year, Mathambo went on a UK tour with Damon Albarn and Nick Zinner. The same year, Mathambo also released his first compilation album Future Sound of Mzansi, consisting of tracks he produced during the last four years.  2013-2014: Escape from '85 & Future Sound of Mzansi (film)  Mathambo published his fourth full-length release Escape from '85 in July 2013. The mixtape is a musical hommage to Mathambo's year of birth. A themed video game accompanied the release. Mathambo also contributed two tracks to the 2013 Red Hot + Fela compilation and released a collaborative mini-album with US rapper Shamon Cassette calles Wave Crusher. As in the past two years, Mathambo was again nominated for Best African Act at the 2013 MOBO awards. Mathambo's debut feature-length documentary film, directed together with filmmaker Lebogang Rasethaba, was released in mid-2014. Twenty years after the end of Apartheid, the three-part series Future Sound of Mzansi presents samples of South Africa's vibrant landscape of electronical music. 'Mzansi' being the isiXhosa and isiZulu term for 'South', thus being the country's colloquial name in youth slang. For the film's production, the Mathambo and Rasethaba travelled the country for two years to explored local genres and styles of electronic music. \\"The film is about the futuristic sounds throughout Mzansi right now,\\" Mathambo explained in an interview. \\"We tend to get stuck on the radio stuff but in the country's crevices, nooks and crannies there are some really exciting progressive movements happening, from the poorest people to the upper classes.\\" The documentary features genres like Shangaan electro and gqom, as well as, musicians like DJ Mujava, Black Coffee, Okmalumkoolkat and many more. It premiered at the Durban International Film Festival.  2014-2015: CasaCosmica & Fantasma  Early 2014 saw Mathambo releasing material from another side project called CasaCosmica. For their album Dark Arts, befriended artists from six cities around the world had recorded material and shared the files via Dropbox. Mathambo also put out another mixtape of South African rap called Cava The Combo (South African Rap Mix). After two solo albums and two compilations, Mathambo formed a new five- piece group called Fantasma. The band includes Marvin Ramalepe aka. DJ Spoko from Pretoria, Maskandi multi-instrumentalist Bhekisenzo Cele from Durban, psychedelic rock guitarist Andr√© Geldenhuys from Cape Town and drummer Michael Buchanan. The five combine wide-ranging influences from traditional Zulu maskandi music, shangaan electro, hiphop, punk, house and more. They released their debut EP Eye of the Sun on Soundway Records with Moonchild contributing vocals on two tracks. A year after their founding, Fantasma released their debut album Free Love in March 2015.  2017: Mzansi Beat Code In 2017, Mathambo released his fifth solo-album, this time with Teka Records. Unlike in his earlier albums, Mzansi Beat Code contains little vocals by Mathambo himself but has other artists sing over his beats. Isa Jawards from the Guardian described the sound of Mzansi Beat Code as \\"less raw and adventurous\\" and more \\"club-friendly house beats\\". Piotr Orlov from NPR called the album the product of Mathambo's \\"lifelong pursuit of a pan-Mzansi aesthetic while also widening the garden of SA's delights to incorporate global vibes.\\"  2015-present: Batuk  Teaming up with DJ Aero Manyelo and vocalists Carla Fonseca (aka. Manteiga), as well as, Nandi Ndlovu in 2015, Mathambo formed a new collective called Batuk. According to Carla Fonseca, the band's name Batuk means 'drum' in Portuguese. To records its debut EP Daniel, released in early 2016, Batuk set up in Mozambique. The EP was followed by a debut album Musica da Terra, also released in 2016, which was recorded in South Africa, Mozambique and Uganda, comprising collaborations with artists from all three countries. The collective aims to use house music to explore different African sounds and unify them in a pan-African fashion. In an interview, Mathambo explained: ‚ÄúThe point of us mixing up these different cultures and languages is to show unity and to expose people, to make people not say ‚Äòthose are the other people‚Äô but to say that ‚Äòthose are my people‚Äô.\\" Batuk continued as a duo consisting of Mathambo and Fonseca, who, in 2018, released their second EP Move!, followed by a worldwide tour. Later that same year, the duo released its second album Kasi Royalty. After the pan-African approach of their first album, Kasi Royalty focuses on South African township sounds - Kasi is a South African slang term for township. Personal life Since about 2009, Mathambo lives in Malm√∂, Sweden, and divides his time between his home and South Africa. He is married to Ana Rab, who occasionally performs with him under the stage name Gnucci Banana.

It was first published on Naver Webtoon on August 7, 2011, and has been released in English by Line. The story follows a high school guy who enrolls as the sole male student at a former all-girls school of champion fighters, and struggles with dealing with his athletic schoolmates, as well as bullies and gangsters, while training in mixed martial arts. The print release of the first volume of Girls of the Wild's was released on November 9, 2012. 260 chapters of Girls of the Wild's have been released online, with the final chapter posted in October 2016. Plot Jaegu Song, a teenager struggling to take care of his two kindergarten-aged siblings, enrolls on scholarship to Wild's High, an all- girls private school that has become co-ed for the purposes of having their female students, who are renowned for being champions in martial arts, behave like maidens in society. As the sole male student, Jaegu is uncomfortable with the excessive attention from the girls, who get extra credits for befriending Jaegu. To make things worse, he has a run-in with the aloof Queen, who is the Wild's League tournament champion. He is befriended by Moonyoung Lee, Queen's best friend and the boxing club captain, and Daldal Choi, a cute and petite Taekwondo club captain. Although he refuses to follow any of Queen's demeaning tasks, he apologizes for his behavior, and Queen begins to develop romantic feelings for him. Queen selects Jaegu to be her opponent in the upcoming tournament, but a conflict between Jaegu and Queen's rival, Hyeshin Kim, from Gura High, results in Jaegu being placed in the preliminary rounds. When Jaegu is bullied by a former middle school classmate, Hangyeol Kim, the girls help train Jaegu to fight and their schools arrange for them to face each other. Jaegu overcomes his fears and knocks out Hangyeol. Since then on, Moonyoung, Daldal, Queen, and Jaegu become good friends. Hopae Kim, a successor in a mafia family who easily wins his preliminary matches, gets into a conflict with Queen which escalates to another sanctioned fight that also involves Jaegu and Moonyoung. With Queen away on family business, Daldal and Moonyoung recruit Jaegu to coach them for the second part of the tournament. Moonyoung and Daldal end up fighting each other in the round of 16. Although Queen returns for her match, she withdraws from the tournament to continue her work. A middle-school boy, Gangrok Choi, joins the group after being rescued by Jaegu from bullying. Hoping to find an edge to use against their Wild's High rivals, Jaeoh joins Jaegu's car wash job while Hopae observes Jaegu more. With Moonyoung to face Hyeshin in the tournament finals, Jaegu meets Hyeshin's older brother, Hyesong, who is a shut-in and, with Hopae's help, gets Hyesong to overcome his fear of bullies and move on with his life. Queen goes on an arranged date with Higyeong Lee, a young businessman who seems perfect in every way, meanwhile, Daldal meets Myunghwan, a handsome older brother of a soccer-playing boy she gets to know. Higyeong gets jealous of Queen's friendship with Jaegu and at a social event Queen discovers she has been photographed in the bathroom. In order to retrieve the pictures, she and Moonyoung visit a warehouse garage where they, along with Jaegu, Hyesong and Jakdu, agree to fight in matches against the owner Jonathan's top fighters. As Wild's High students wrap up final exams, Daldal confronts Queen because both of them have romantic feelings for Jaegu. Feeling sad about the rivalry with Queen, Daldal is comforted by Myunghwan which raises the ire of a girl who likes Myunghwan. Higyeong and Jonathan send fighters to get revenge on Queen and Moonyoung but fail once more. After Queen's grandfather cancels the dating arrangement with Higyeong, he meets Jaegu to question his motives with Queen. During the summer, the group, along with Jaegu's siblings, Gangrok, Inseong, Jungu, Hyesong, and Jakdu, go on a trip to one of Queen's resorts. Queen finally tells Jaegu that she likes him and Jaegu reciprocates. However, after returning home, he turns down both Daldal and Queen. After returning home from the trip, Queen goes to Europe and Daldal starts avoiding Jaegu, but is abducted by a group of her fans; she is rescued by her parents, along with Jaegu, Myunghwan, and Hyesong. After this incident, Jaegu's and Daldal's friendship gets better but, at the same time, Daldal gets closer to Myunghwan. As part of a volunteering project at Wild's High, Moonyoung, Daldal, Jaegu, and Jungu join the city's \\"Walk Home Safe\\" where Jaegu attempts to protect a middle school girl from her bullies; the bullies bring in a larger gang to confront him but they fail to do so. On Christmas evening, the group, along with Jaegu's siblings, Gangrok, Inseong, and Jungu, celebrate together, and Jaegu realizes his feelings for Queen who is still abroad. As students enter their next year of school, Jaegu takes over the boxing club as captain, Queen is studying in Japan, Daldal and Myunghwan start dating, whereas Moonyoung and Jungu continue to pursue their unrequited crushes. In the last chapter, Jaegu gathers his courage to go to Japan and reunites with Queen, telling her he promises to be with her always. Characters ; Jaegu Song () The series' protagonist, the first male student in Wild's High after it became a co-ed institution. After his father died, his mother abandons him and his two twin siblings, Jaesom and Jaehyeong (at first, they are in kindergarten but Jaegu later sends them to a primary school for gifted pupils). This leads to his aversion to women. After school, he works at a car wash. He originally chose Wild's because it was close to home and he was given a scholarship. After being forced to become stronger to help his family, and to survive inside and outside school, he picks up boxing and trains for the Wild's League preliminaries under the care of Queen, Moonyoung and Daldal, and is able to defeat a bully who had harassed him since middle school (later, he still trains himself and even becomes the captain of the boxing club). He also coaches Moonyoung and Daldal during the Wild's League Tournament. Despite the attention Queen and Daldal give him, Jaegu is oblivious to their affections. He initially accepts Queen's confession, but after interacting with Daldal, he turns both girls down. In the final chapter, he reunites with Queen in Japan and promises to be with her always. ; Ingui \\"Queen\\" Yoon () Known primarily as Queen, Ingui is the heroine in the series, a second-year student and the Wild's League Tournament champion.

She is a mixed martial artist, proficient in nearly every form of martial arts, where she helps spar with each of the school clubs. She is the daughter of the financial corporation YK Line, where she was raised to be its successor until her younger brother was born. Despite their initial bad impressions, she develops feelings for Jaegu, who does not fawn over her like everyone else. In later chapters, she musters her courage to tell Jaegu that she likes him as more than just a friend. After being rejected, she stays abroad for a few months to clear her head but is eventually reunited with Jaegu. ; Moonyoung Lee () Moonyoung is a second-year student and Queen's best friend. The president of Wild's High's boxing club, she has pink hair usually tied up in a bun and wears a red tracksuit.

She has a friendly rivalry with Moonyoung who makes fun of her petite stature. She falls in love with Jaegu after initially seeing him as a chance to advance her feminine reputation, and because he was the first boy to refuse her kiss. Over the course of the series, she constantly flirts and shows affection towards Jaegu, who does not reciprocate. She has good cooking skills, most probably inherited by her mother, Jeongran Park, who is a celebrity chef in Korean cuisine and regularly appears on television; Daldal sometimes appears in her mother's TV cooking shows.

YouTube Poops are traditionally uploaded to the video sharing website YouTube, hence the name. History and techniques The first YTP wasn't uploaded onto YouTube, but on the website SheezyArt in 2004 by a user named SuperYoshi. The video was called \\"The Adventures of Super Mario 3 Remixed\\", or what is now known as \\"I'D SAY HE'S HOT ON OUR TAIL\\". A typical YouTube Poop uses visual and auditory effects to alter the underlying work. Some of these videos may involve completely or partially repurposing sources to create or convey a story, while others follow a non-linear narrative, and some may contain no storyline at all. Alternatively, a YouTube Poop may consist solely of an existing video repeated in a slowed or remixed loop. In many cases, YouTube Poops utilize a bizarre sequence of elements which may entertain, confuse, or irritate, depending on the viewer. Associate professor of cultural anthropology at Kansas State University, Michael Wesch, has defined YouTube Poops as \\"absurdist remixes that ape and mock the lowest technical and aesthetic standards of remix culture to comment on remix culture itself\\". Media sources of YouTube Poops include television shows, movies, anime, cartoons, commercials, video games, and other videos obtained from YouTube or elsewhere. In the late 2000s, cutscenes from games released on the Philips CD-i platform (most notably Hotel Mario, Link: The Faces of Evil, and Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon) were an incredibly common source in YTPs, due to the perceived campy nature of the animations. YTP is often derivative in the sense that the work of one artist (or pooper) is sometimes used as the underlying work for another video. Lawrence Lessig, Professor of Law at Harvard Law School, referred to this behavior as an example of call & response within a remix culture. Another prominent type of video in the community is known as a \\"collab\\", wherein a group of YouTube Poopers' videos are compiled to make a longer, often feature-length video. Most of the time, the videos featured are made exclusively for the collab and are not uploaded to YouTube prior to the collab's release. YouTube Poops have evolved over the years, and in the current era, it has more of a similarity to avant-garde media. Copyright and fair use Due to the use of copyrighted materials and the manner in which these sources are depicted, YTPs may be removed from YouTube following a DMCA complaint. However, political scientist and author Trajce Cvetkovski noted in 2013 that, despite Viacom filing a copyright infringement lawsuit with YouTube in 2007, YouTube Poops such as \\"The Sky Had a Weegee\\" by Hurricoaster, which features scenes from the animated series SpongeBob SquarePants (in particular, the episode \\"Shanghaied\\") and Weegee (a satiric caricature based on Nintendo's Luigi as he appears in the DOS version of Mario Is Missing), remained on YouTube. The law in the United Kingdom does allow people to use copyrighted material for the purposes of parody, pastiche, and caricature without infringing on the copyright of the material. Copyright owners are only able to sue the parodist if the work contains hateful or discriminative messages. If the case is then taken to court, it will be down to a judge to decide whether the video meets these criteria. Individual responses Individuals involved in YouTube Poops sometimes make efforts to take YouTube Poopers' videos down because mature and defamatory content is prevalent in them, especially if they have a large audience of children watching their work. Children's poet Michael Rosen (who claims to have \\"become a cult\\" among YouTube Poopers) initially attempted to take his videos down, but after a few frank discussions with YouTube Poopers, he decided to allow the videos to stay online, comparing the remixes to the use of photo editing software in a later interview. Rosen issued a warning on his website, saying that: He put a similar warning on his YouTube channel's \\"about\\" page.

The Mennonites of Uruguay are made up of ethnic Plautdietsch-speaking Russian Mennonites, who are descendants of Friesian, Flemish and Prussian people, as well as Spanish- speaking Uruguayans of all ethnic backgrounds, that converted responding to the missionary efforts of the immigrants. The immigrant belong to a group that is often referred to as Russian Mennonites, because they developed into an ethnic group in the Russian Empire. At the end of the century there were over 1,000 living on Uruguayan territory. Origin The majority of the 1,200 Mennonites who came to Uruguay in the aftermath of World War II lived for about 400 years in the Vistula delta until they were expulsed. A minority came from the region around Lemberg. They spoke and party still speak Plautdietsch, the language which developed in the Vistula delta and which until today unites all conservative \\"Russian\\" Mennonites, that have their origin in that region. History 1956 General Conference Mennonite Church meeting (left to right: Gerhard Lohrenz, Ernst Regehr (Uruguay), S. Floyd Pannabecker photo published in Der Bote, October 17, 1956, p. 3) On October 27, 1948 the first group of about 750 arrived in Uruguay. They founded the El Omb√∫ congregation in 1950. The second group of immigrants, comprising 429 persons, arrived 19 October 1951 and founded the Gartental Colony in 1952. A congregation was also organized in Montevideo the same year. The immigrants established three agricultural settlements, that have organized separate producer-consumer cooperatives. Each settlement has a school, retirement center, and a hospital-nursing home. A fourth colony, that is specialized in produce, was founded near Montevideo. Colonies, membership and population The immigrants established three agricultural settlements that have organized separate producer-consumer cooperatives. Each settlement has a school, retirement center, and a hospital-nursing home: *El Omb√∫, founded 1950 *Gartental, founded 1952 *Colonia Delta, founded 1955 *Colonia Nicolich In 1986 the four Russian Mennonite congregations had a membership of 525. There were 507 members in the four congregations in 2003, 572 in 2009 and 607 in 2012. Altogether there were 1,457 members in 23 congregations in 2012, the majority not German speaking. Because only baptized adult members are counted, the whole Mennonite population including children is somewhat higher. Customs and beliefs Although Uruguayan Mennonites are relatively integrated in the mainstream society, some of them still keep their original Plautdietsch language. There is strong tendency to marry outside the Mennonite community, which indicates a large degree of cultural assimilation. This is in stark contrast to other \\"Russian\\" Mennonites in South American countries like Paraguay, Bolivia and Argentina.

By 1932 the Band had twice toured all stations of BBC Radio, and they were to broadcast there twice again in April of that year, by which time they had broadcast 72 times on radio. By 16 December of that year, they had broadcast 80 times. They aspired to performing music which was \\"out of the rut of marches, operatic selections and other pierhead pieces.\\" They performed on 5 March 1932 at the Queen's Hall, London. On the afternoon and evening of Sunday 20 March of the same year, they performed at the opening of the new art deco frontage of the Central Bandstand, Herne Bay, Kent.

Created in 1973, the site became a theme park in 1981. It offers more than 25 attractions and more than 600 animals in semi- captivity, among several animal shows.  History  Le Pal zoo was created in 1973 by Andr√© Charbonnier (1929-1981) with the help of the Vincennes Zoo's veterinary surgeon. In the first years the park already had a train and a small playground. It's in 1981 that the park became a true amusement park. 280000 people visited Le Pal in 1998. Attractions Twist Chaises volantes There are many attractions and shows including : *Yukon Quad, a launched roller coaster, built by Intamin (2018). *Twist, a spinning roller coaster, built by Mack Rides (2011). *Tigre de Sib√©rie, a steel roller coaster, built by Reverchon Industries (1990). *Azteka, a steel roller coaster, built by Soquet (2003). *Alligator Baie, a Splash Battle (2014). *Lac des chercheurs d'or, a tow boat ride. *Rapido, water slides (2005). *Bateau pirate, a pirate ship (1995). *Rivi√®re canadienne, a log flume (1992). *Disque du soleil, Disk'O coaster (2007). *Descente du Colorado, a river rafting ride (1988). *Chaises volantes, wave swinger (2016)  Lodging  With an investment of 4.5 million euros Le Pal launches \\"Les Lodges du Pal\\" a unique safari-like style hotel in Europe, on April 13, 2013. Extended over 9 to 12 acres, it includes a hundred of bed in 24 lodges with a 40 m¬≤ surface area. These lodges were built on piles and are embellished with the African savannah colors, and can also host 5 people. These accommodations give a beautiful view on several animal species such as zebras or springboks along with a new exotic area. The park suggests the Tanganika restaurant and a patio facing a pond. Surrounded by the forest and next to the zoo's area, the hotel is only available during the operating season of the theme park.  Economic data  Each year, the park invests 10 to 13% of its turnover in innovations. In other words, almost 3.5 million euros are reinvested yearly for a turnover around 12 million euros. With an 80% loyalty rate, Le Pal is the fifth most visited amusement park in France and the fourth in the zoo sector. It is the first tourist attraction in the department of Auvergne. Protection programs  Le Pal Nature Foundation  Created in April 2008, Le Pal Nature Foundation is dedicated to the biodiversity preservation all around the world. It initiates, helps, financially assists, technically and human projects in France and abroad which suggest perennial solutions towards threats facing biodiversity, especially endangered species as well as their habitat. Projects are chosen according to their seriousness, their actions in the long run and their involvement of local populations. The financial fulfillment of the foundation is a budget of ‚Ç¨45,000 per year within a multi-year actions program over 5 years.  Obtaining the Green Globe certification  In October 2010, Le Pal was the first French theme park which obtained a Green Globe, an international certification for sustainable tourism.

Life and work  Mich√®le Vergne studied from 1962 to 1966 at the √âcole Normal Sup√©rieure de jeunes filles, which today is part of the ENS. She wrote her diploma thesis 1966 with Claude Chevalley, entitled \\"Vari√©t√© des alg√®bres de Lie nilpotentes\\" and her doctoral thesis in 1971 under the supervision of Jacques Dixmier (\\"Recherches sur les groupes et les alg√®bres de Lie\\") at the University of Paris. She is currently Directeur de Recherche at CNRS. Vergne worked in the construction of unitary representations of Lie groups using coadjoint orbits of the Lie algebras. She proved a generalized Poisson summation formula (called by its Poisson- Plancherel formula), which is the integral of a function on adjoint orbits with their Fourier transformation integrals on coadjoint \\"quantized\\" orbits. Further, she studied the index theory of elliptic differential operators and generalizations of this to equivariant cohomology. With Nicole Berline, it became a link between Atiyah-Bott fixed-point formulas and Kirillov character formula in 1985.American Journal Mathematics, Bd. 107, S. 1159 The theory has applications to physics (e.g., some works of Edward Witten). In addition she also worked in the geometry of numbers; more specifically, the number of integer points in convex polyhedra. With Masaki Kashiwara, she formulated a conjecture about the combinatorial structure of the enveloping algebras of Lie algebras. Since 1997, she is a member of the Acad√©mie des sciences. She received the Prix Amp√®re in 1997. She is a member of The American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1992, she gave a plenary lecture at the first European Congress of Mathematics in Paris (Cohomologie equivariante et formules de car√°cteres). In 2006 she gave a plenary lecture at the International Congress of mathematics in Madrid (Applications of Equivariant Cohomology) and in 1983 she was an invited speaker at the ICM in Warsaw (Formule de Kirilov et indice de l'op√©rateur de Dirac). In 2008 she was Emmy-Noether - visiting professor at the University of G√∂ttingen. She is a fellow of the American Mathematical Society. Mich√®le Vergne was married to Victor Kac.

The report published on 16 September 2013 focused on the 21 August 2013 Ghouta chemical attack, which took place whilst the Mission was in Damascus to investigate prior alleged incidents, including the Khan al-Assal chemical attack in March 2013. Background The Four Seasons Hotel Damascus, where the UN team stayed Two days before the attack, a UN team headed by √Öke Sellstr√∂m arrived in Damascus with permission, from the Syrian government, to investigate earlier alleged chemical weapons use. On the day of the attack, UN Secretary General Ban Ki- moon expressed \\"the need to investigate [the Ghouta incident as] soon as possible,\\" hoping for consent from the Syrian government. The next day, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay urged government and opposition forces to allow investigation, and Ban requested the government provide immediate access. On 23 August, clashes between rebel and government forces continued in and around Ghouta, government shelling continued, and UN inspectors were denied access for a second day. United States officials told The Wall Street Journal that the White House \\"became convinced\\" that the Syrian government was trying to hide the evidence of chemical weapons use by shelling the sites and delaying their inspection. Ban called for a ceasefire to allow the inspectors to visit the attack sites. On 25 August the government agreed to cease hostilities with the presence of UN inspectors, and agreements between the UN, government and rebel factions were reached for five hours of cease-fire each day from 26 to 29 August.Ian Sample, The Guardian, 16 September 2013, UN inspectors in Syria: under fire, in record time, sarin is confirmed Investigation Early in the morning of 26 August several mortars hit central Damascus, including one that fell near the Four Seasons hotel the UN inspectors were staying in.Reuters, 26 August 2013, At least two mortar bombs hit Damascus near U.N. team's hotel Later in the day the UN team came under sniper fire en route to Moadamiyah in western Ghouta (in the south of Damascus), forcing them to return to their hotel and replace one of their vehicles before continuing their investigation four hours later.BBC, 16 August 2013, Syria crisis: UN inspectors' convoy hit by sniper fire The attack prompted Ban to declare he would register a complaint to the Syrian government and opposition authorities. After returning to Moadamiyah the team visited clinics and makeshift field hospitals, collected samples and conducted interviews with witnesses, survivors and doctors. The inspectors spoke with 20 victims of the attacks and took blood and hair samples, soil samples, and samples from domestic animals. As a result of the delay caused by the sniper attack, the team's time in Moadamiyah was substantially shortened, with the scheduled expiry of the daily cease-fire leaving them around 90 minutes on the ground. On 28 and 29 August the UN team visited Zamalka and Ein Tarma in eastern Ghouta, in the east of Damascus, for a total time of five and a half hours. On 30 August the team visited at a Syrian government military hospital in Mazzeh, and collected samples.Zeina Karam and Kimberly Dozier, Associated Press, The Seattle Times, 8 September 2013, Doubts linger over Syria gas attack responsibility The Daily Star, 31 August 2013, U.N. inspectors wrap up work in Damascus Report The UN investigation into the chemical attacks in Ghouta was published on 16 September. The report stated that \\"the environmental, chemical and medical samples, we have collected, provide clear and convincing evidence that surface-to-surface rockets containing the nerve agent sarin were used in Ein Tarma, Moadamiyah and Zamalka in the Ghouta area of Damascus.\\" The inspectors were able to identify several surface-to-surface rockets at the affected sites as 140mm BM-14 rockets originally manufactured in Russia and 330mm rockets probably manufactured in Syria. U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon called the findings \\"beyond doubt and beyond the pale,\\" and clear evidence of a war crime. \\"The results are overwhelming and indisputable ... A majority of the rockets or rocket fragments recovered were found to be carrying sarin.\\" The report, which was \\"careful not to blame either side,\\" said that during the mission's work in the rebel controlled Zamalka and Ein Tarma neighborhoods, \\"individuals arrived carrying other suspected munitions indicating that such potential evidence is being moved and possibly manipulated.\\" The areas were under rebel control, but the report did not elaborate on who the individuals were. The UN investigators were accompanied by a rebel leader: An August Scientific American article had described difficulties that could arise when attempting to identify the manufacturer of sarin from soil or tissue samples. UN lead investigator Sellstr√∂m told the UN Security Council that the quality of the sarin was higher than that used by Iraq in the Iran‚ÄìIraq War and stating \\"In particular, the environmental, chemical and medical samples we have collected provide clear and convincing evidence that surface-to-surface rockets containing the nerve agent sarin were used,\\" a conclusion omitted in the final report,Reuters, 16 September 2013, U.N. confirms sarin used in Syria attack; U.S., UK, France blame Assad implying a purity higher than the Iraqi chemical weapons program's 45‚Äì60%.United Nations UNMOVIC, S/2006/701 ‚Äì Overview of the chemical munitions recently found in Iraq (By comparison, Aum Shinrikyo used nearly pure sarin in the 1994 Matsumoto incident.) According to Human Rights Watch, hundreds of kilograms of sarin were used in the attack, which it said suggested government responsibility, as opposition forces were not known to possess significant amounts of sarin.The Guardian, 16 September 2013 The UN report states, \\"Chemical weapons use in such meteorological conditions maximizes their potential impact as the heavy gas can stay close to the ground and penetrate into lower levels of buildings and constructions where many people were seeking shelter.\\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-syria-crisis- un-idUSBRE98F0ED20130916 Responses The Russian government dismissed the initial UN report after it was released, calling it \\"one-sided\\" and \\"distorted\\". On 17 September, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov reiterated his government's belief that the opposition carried out the attacks as a \\"provocation\\". The United Nations high representative for disarmament affairs, Angela Kane, stated that the inspection team would review Russia's objections.

After taking up the job of water- carrier (for the public baths) in the 19th century, they turned to trading in firewood and coal delivery, drinks (wine, spirits, lemonade), hostelry and sometimes had a sideline in scrap. This change of occupation went on during the Second French Empire, as Paris developed its water supply network.  Etymology  Praise for the bougnat Last bougnat in Paris At this time, Parisians started calling them bougnats. The word came to be associated with (Charcoal burners) and the Auvergnat dialect.According to himself citing from , the word derived from the shouts of those delivering coal: de carbou n'ia. (Auvergnat dialect: charbouniat). The origin of this strong alliance between Auvergne and coal may be from the Brassac-les-Mines coal sold in Paris. The term expanded meaning, to include the sense of Parisian caf√©s owned by bougnats, which would both sell drinks and deliver coal. They were in every working-class district, and one would often see the signage (\\"wine and coal\\"). History Hard-working, and with a close-knit community, many had success stories. Today, although many Paris caf√©s have changed ownership, the community of Aveyronnais (Rouergat) owners is still well represented, and is relatively well-off, as illustrated in the film XXL (with G√©rard Depardieu) in which the director draws an interesting parallel with the Jewish community that lives alongside, in the Sentier district, and which in some ways it resembles. The husband would deliver the coal, while his wife would serve the customers. Some also served meals, and had rooms to let. The golden age of the bougnats was the first half of the 20th century. There is still at least one bougnat in Paris, on the Rue √âmile-Lepeu in the 11th arrondissement.  Famous bougnats  Le Bougnat, 26 Rue Chanoinesse, Paris. Without doubt, the standard for the bougnat is Marcellin Cazes (born 1888 in Laguiole, Aveyron). He started as a commis waiter in a bougnat, before opening his own, first in the 11th arrondissement of Paris, and later at Les Halles. In 1920, he bought a well-regarded establishment, the Brasserie Lipp, and in 1931 the Balzar, on the Rue des √âcoles. In 1935, he started a literary prize, the Prix Cazes, which is still awarded each year. Another bougnat of note is Paul Boubal (1908 - 1988), born in Sainte-Eulalie-d'Olt, Aveyron. He was owner-manager of the Caf√© de Flore, which he bought in 1939 and ran until 1983. His parents had settled in the Rue Ordener, in the 18th arrondissement.See also the work of his grandson Christophe Durand (pen-name Boubal): More recently, another Aveyronnais from around Languole, Gilbert Costes, from a modest country family, went on to own, with them, around forty Parisian establishments. In 1999, he became President of the Paris Tribunal de Commerce.  In art and literature  The bougnat appears in the songs of Georges Brassens (Brave Margot) and Jacques Brel (Mathilde: \\"\\" - \\"Bougnat, bring us wine, that for weddings and feasts\\"). In literature, bougnats appear in the works of Blaise Cendrars and more so in Marcel Aym√©, where is mae the hero of his novella Le Mariage de C√©sarThe novel starts: \\"Il y avait √† Montmartre un bougnat vertueux qui s'appelait C√©sar. Il tenait boutique de vins et charbons √† l'enseigne des 'Enfants du Massif'.\\" (\\"There was in Montmartre a kindly bougnat, called C√©sar. He ran a shop selling wine and coal, under the sign of the 'Children of the Massif'.\\" (The Marriage of C√©sar). Lesser-known authors such as Joseph Bialot () and Marc Tardieu (, ) have also made the bougnat a central character in their work. In Asterix and the Chieftain's Shield, the eleventh collection of The Adventures of Asterix, the town of Gergovie is full of \\"wine and coal\\" shops, in reference to the bougnats.

His direct ancestor, Obadiah Bruen, being one of the founders of that city. His father was a wealthy businessman who was thought at one point to be one of the richest men in New York.  Studies  In his youth, Bruen had an unusual interest in books: starting as a six year old he would shut himself in a room to focus on his reading. In 1808 at age 15 he attended Columbia College and graduated from there in 1812 with high honors. It was at this point that he chose to pursue a religious life and enrolled in the Theological Seminary of the Associate Reformed Church under the direction of Dr John M. Mason, who was also the head of the seminary. In 1816 Bruen was licensed to preach by the Presbyterian Classis of New York. Bruen was first troubled by a chronic illness by 1812. When later the opportunity to travel to Europe was presented to him he chose to go partly with the hope of a benefit to his health.  Travels in Europe  In 1816 Bruen traveled to Europe with Mason and remained there for more than two years. Very soon after arriving in England the two men traveled to Scotland and spent time with a noted Presbyterian leader there. Bruen was introduced to Rev. Robert Lundie and his wife, Mary Grey Lundie, with whom he carried on a religious correspondence over several years. In 1831 it was Mary (now Mrs Duncan) who published a collection of Bruen's letters as a memorial to his life and service to the church.  Ministry  Just before returning from Europe in 1818 Bruen received an invitation to officiate in the church of the Oratoire in Paris. After taking his ordination in London on November 4 he traveled to Paris and served there until May 1819 before resigning to return to America. He preached in several places before settling in Manhattan and applying to the Presbyterian Church of New York to serve as a missionary there in the vicinity of Bleecker Street in the fall of 1822.  Family  Bruen was married to Mary Anne Davenport on January 2, 1823. They had four children, two of whom died young. The two surviving daughters were Frances Davenport Bruen, born in 1825 and Mary Lundie Bruen who was born in 1828 and lived many years with her mother after Matthias's death. Frances married Charles Callahan Perkins on June 12, 1855 and they had three children..  Death  On Sunday August 30, 1829, while opening the morning service, Bruen was attacked by a sudden illness which forced him to retire from the church. His condition worsened during the week and he died the following Sunday. On Monday, September 7, 1829, his remains were laid in the vault at the foot of the pulpit from which he had addressed the members of his congregation. After Bruen's death, a large collection of his letters was published as a memorial to his life, first in the United States in 1831. and then a very similar volume was published Scotland in 1832.

Beginning as local aristocracy in the 5th century, it rose to great prominence in the 5th, 6th and early 7th centuries, when several successive heads of the family occupied high imperial offices, including the consulship. The family disappears after the Sasanian conquest of Egypt.  History  The family's origin is uncertain. A certain Aurelius Apion, who was augustalian prefect of Egypt some time before 328, as well as a slightly later Flavius Strategius, comes and praeses of Thebais, can not be shown to have belonged to the family. The earliest known member of this family, Strategius I, is attested in a series of papyri from Oxyrhynchus. He served as an administrator in the imperial estates (the domus divina) in the 430s, eventually rising to head administrator of the domus divina in the entire Oxyrhynchite nome. He later advanced to the title of comes sacri consistorii and the rank of vir spectabilis, until his death some time before December 469. Strategius is known to have had one daughter, Isis, who may have married the man once thought to be the first known member of the family, Apion I. As more recent discoveries of papyri have shown, Apion I descended from another prominent line of local aristocracy, the Septimii Flaviani of the neighbouring Heracleopolite nome. His father, Flavianus, had even served as comes sacrarum largitionum in Constantinople. From a local position in Oxyrhynchus in 492, Apion I rose to become honorary consul (apo hypaton) by 497 and then patrikios by 503. He was responsible for provisioning the Byzantine forces in the Anastasian War against Sasanian Persia, but fell out of favour with Emperor Anastasius I and was exiled and forcibly ordained as a priest in 510, only to be recalled by Justin I in 518 and made praetorian prefect of the East. Sometime between 525 and 532, he was converted with his family to Chalcedonian orthodoxy, abjuring Monophysitism. Apion I had two sons, Herakleidas and Strategius II. Herakleidas is a relatively obscure figure: although possibly the elder of the two, he is known only to have served as city elder (principalis) at Heracleopolis, and to have been ordained a deacon at the time of his father's disgrace in 510. Strategius II is attested as a curialis in 489, was comes domesticorum in 497 and honorary consul and honorary magister militum by 518. He served as augustalian prefect sometime before 523. Under Justinian I, he became a patrikios, was sent as an envoy to the Persians during the Iberian War, and served as comes sacrarum largitionum in 535‚Äì538. Among his duties in the latter post was overseeing the reconstruction of the Hagia Sophia, after its destruction in the Nika riots. He died in early 542. Strategius II was married to a certain Leontia. Their son, Apion II, received the ordinary consulship for the year 539, shortly after he came of age, marking the family's political apogee. At the time, like his father, he also held the title of comes domesticorum. In later life he became a patrikios and protopatrikios, which placed him among the senior-most members of the Byzantine Senate. Earlier works considered him as having been‚Äîpossibly by proxy, with Apion himself remaining at Constantinople‚Äîa provincial governor in Egypt (dux Thebaidos ca. 548‚Äì550 and pagarch in the Arsinoite nome ca. 556), but according to more recent research, these posts were most likely held by other Apiones. Apion II died in 578/9, and his inheritance was controlled collectively by an undetermined number of mostly unnamed heirs for eight years, after which three principal heirs emerge by name: the hypatissa Flavia Praeiecta, either the daughter of Apion II or his daughter-in-law (see appears to have been married to a Strategius), and her two sons, George and Apion III. George is last attested in 590 and Praiecta in 591, after which Apion III remained the sole heir of the Oxyrhynchus estates. Apion III married Eusebia, a scion of the Roman senatorial family of the Anicii, and had at least one son, Strategius IV. From letters of Pope Gregory the Great, the family lived at Constantinople. An honorary consul and patrikios by 604/5, Apion III died in late 619 or early January 620, a fact possibly connected with the Sassanid conquest of Egypt in the same period. The Apion household continues to be in evidence under the Persian occupation, at least until August 626, but is no longer mentioned thereafter. Another important member of the family, from a collateral branch of the family resident in the Heracleopolite and Arsinoite nomes, was another Strategius (known as \\"pseudo-Strategius III\\" in some sources). He is first attested in 591, and like his contemporary Apion III, was an honorary consul and patrikios, as well as pagarch in the Heracleopolite and Arsinoite nomes. He was involved in the reconciliation of the Syrian and Egyptian Monophysite Churches in 616, but both he and his family disappear after the Persian conquest.  Social position in Egypt  The family originally belonged to the local municipal aristocracy (curiales), and rose to power and influence through imperial service. In this sense, the Apiones typify the phenomenon, attested across the late Roman world, of local aristocratic families using the opportunities opened up by the expansion of the state bureaucracy in the 4th century to secure positions with the imperial civil service. This new \\"aristocracy of service\\" derived from this association both prestige and wealth, which allowed it to out-compete local rivals and establish an economic and political predominance in its home localities. This was chiefly expressed in their acquisition of large estates, in which they were helped by the monetization of the economy and the introduction of the gold solidus as the main currency, to which they, as salaried officials, had better access than their rivals. The Apiones in particular came to hold very extensive properties in several Middle Egyptian nomes, as attested by hundreds of papyri relating to their administration. In the Oxyrhynchite nome alone, the Apiones are held to have controlled some 75,000 acres, or about two fifths of the available arable land. Lack of data for the estates in the neighbouring nomes, as well as the fact that their holdings were not contiguous, does not permit a similar estimate, but their property must have been similarly extensive. Like other great land-holdings of the time, the Apion estates were divided in two categories: land directly exploited by the Apion household (autourgia), and allotments (ktemata) leased to farmers of villages (choria, epoikia, or komai) belonging to the estate. Earlier studies, based on E.R. Hardy's The Large Estates of Byzantine Egypt (1931), believed that after the middle of the 6th century, the Apiones returned from Constantinople to Egypt, abandoning their imperial affiliations in favour of local offices, and even re-converting to Monophysitism. This view was rejected by J. Gascou in 1985, and is no longer held. Instead, the Apiones, or at least the heads of the family, are shown to have been mostly absentee landlords, staying in Constantinople in close proximity to the imperial court, rather than Egypt. Accordingly, the dispersed Apion estates were governed by an extensive \\"private bureaucracy\\" which included even its own postal service, modelled after the imperial cursus publicus, with both an \\"express\\" courier service and a slower post, both by land and by river. The papyri also make clear that the Apiones exercised extensive authority locally, possessing both a private jailhouse and a private police force (bucellarii), often of foreign, e.g. Gothic, origin. As J.K. Keenan writes, these facts, along with the existence of serfs (coloni adscripticii) in the great estates, \\"are most responsible for the impression that the Apion household, that Oxyrhynchus with its other great landlords, that late antique Egypt as a whole was 'feudal' in the medieval sense of the term, and that the great houses of Egypt were resistant to and in conflict with the imperial government\\". This belief has been modified in recent times towards an image of toleration and tacit approval by the imperial government of the great houses' local power, and cooperation between the two sides. For instance, the great landholding families assumed the maintenance of the irrigation works, from which depended not only the provincial economy, but also Constantinople's grain supply.

She is memorialized by a Victorian mausoleum in Green-Wood Cemetery, Brooklyn by Robert Launitz and John Frazee. The ornately and expensively decorated monument attracted thousands of visitors to Green-Wood Cemetery in the late 19th century. Background Charlotte's father, Charles Canda, was an officer in Napoleon's army and the headmaster of a school on Lafayette Place in Manhattan. He and his wife, Adele Canda, adopted Charlotte when she was an infant. Charles Canda was dropping one of Charlotte's friends off at a home on Waverly Place in Manhattan on her 17th birthday when the horses became spooked, perhaps because of a storm, and bolted. Charlotte fell out of the moving carriage at Broadway and Waverly Place, hitting her head on the pavement. She died in her father's arms. Burial Canda, as a Catholic, was first interred at the Old Saint Patrick's Cathedral at Prince Street and Mott Street. Her monumental mausoleum, completed in 1847, is located at Greenbough Avenue and Fern Avenue within Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn. She was interred in consecrated ground at the cemetery on April 29, 1848. The monument is constructed of white Carrara marble in the style of a tabernacle and features Gothic Revival architecture stylings such as spires, carved flowers, and angels. A large statue of Canda in her birthday gown is displayed beneath a marble canopy. In an 1893 article, The New World remarked on her \\"fair form still preserved in Marble.\\" Sculptor Launitz did the tomb design work along with Frazee, although Frazee's role has been called into question by some of his biographers. The design was based in part on Canda's own sketches for a memorial to her aunt, Clemence Canda, who had died the year before. Symbolism at the monument includes books (Charlotte was fluent in five languages); musical instruments; drawing tools; down-turned torches, signifying extinguished life (except life that burns in the hereafter); parrots (her pets); and seventeen roses (she was celebrating her seventeenth birthday). The monument is also seventeen feet high and seventeen feet long. The mausoleum cost more than $45,000 (equivalent to $1,538,988.16 in 2020) and was once a popular monument for visitors in Green-Wood Cemetery, attracting crowds. In the late 19th century, New Yorkers used to picnic at the cemetery. The expense and spectacle of the memorial, together with the romantic tragedy of the young heiress's death, attracted such a degree of public attention that for some decades after her death, references in popular press simply to \\"Miss Canda\\" could be understood to refer to Charlotte. Charles Albert Jarrett de la Marie (1819‚Äì1847), said to be Canda's fianc√©, committed suicide a year after her death and is buried nearby. As a suicide, he could not be buried on consecrated ground with his bride-to-be and was instead buried in unconsecrated ground nearby under a small upright tombstone with his family's coat of arms.

He tied six others for the league lead with two shutouts. In 2001, Ishii was 5-9 with a 3.76 ERA. The veteran right-hander rebounded to 8-3, 3.11 in 2002. Had he qualified, he would have ranked fifth in the PL in ERA. Among Seibu's regularly-used starting pitchers, only Chih- Chia Chang had a better ERA while Ishii out-pitched Koji Mitsui, Nishiguchi, Ming-Chieh Hsu, Shiozaki and Matsuzaka. Seibu was swept in the 2002 Japan Series by the Yomiuri Giants; Ishii started and lost game two. He was roughed up for seven hits and six runs in just two innings before Hsu relieved him. Ishii was 1-2 with a 4.24 ERA in 2003 while battling shoulder problems. Not fully healthy in 2004, he was just 1-5 with a 4.65 ERA. Matsuzaka, Nishiguchi, Chang and Kazuyuki Hoashi all had better regular seasons, but Seibu skipper Tsutomu It≈ç still went with Ishii to start game one of the 2004 Japan Series. He turned in a gem, a combined shutout of the Chunichi Dragons for the win. He did not pitch again until game seven, when he was called on to face Domingo Guzm√°n in the finale. Ishii again pitched shutout ball to get the win (his bullpen did allow two late runs). He finished 2-0 with 13 scoreless innings and only five hits for the Series, having won more games than he had in the entire regular season, something no one had ever done before. He was named Japan Series MVP, presumably his career highlight. Ishii fell to 2-4, 8.04 in 2005 with a .353 opponent average. He rebounded to 4-1, 3.49 in 2006 while pitching full-time as a reliever for the first time in nine years. He allowed six runs in 7 1/3 innings in 2007 to end his playing career. He later was Seibu's pitching coach. Overall, Takashi Ishii was 68-58 with 13 saves and a 3.78 ERA in 321 games in Nippon Pro Baseball. Ishii retired after the 2007 season, and became a pitching coach for the Lions.

Formed within recorded history by the movement of the river, it consists of a bulge-shaped piece of land between the river's primary channel and an oxbow lake. Land on the island is generally valuable for farming, especially when protected from flooding, while the lake has developed a reputation as a valuable sport-fishing location. Geography Fields in the island's southern portion Grand Tower Island lies on the left bank of the Mississippi River in a remote area between St. Louis, Missouri and Cairo, Illinois. It shares its name with the adjacent small city of Grand Tower, Illinois, as well as with the landmark Tower Rock island on the Missouri side of the river.

A towhead (a narrow island much longer than its width) approximately long lies in the river between Grand Tower Island and the Missouri mainland. The island's location on the \\"wrong\\" side of the Mississippi is the result of a cutoff that formed in recorded history: during the early years of steamboat navigation on the river, the main course flowed through a meander, but the course ultimately shifted and converted the meander into a stagnant oxbow lake.Husar, John. \\"Grand Tower Haven for Bass, Crappie-and 'Eels'\\".

Measuring approximately east-west and north-south, Grand Tower Island is traversed by a single north-south road, Island Road, that travels south from Grand Tower, crosses the island, turns sharply eastward to run along the narrow strip of land between the lake and the lowest section of the Big Muddy River, and then proceeds southeastward to connect with Illinois Route 3.

The portion of the island between the levee and the river measures approximately ; all privately owned, it is primarily forest with some farmland, although some of the area not currently farmed is capable of conversion into farmland, and some of the land is made useless by the presence of factors such as wetlands. Virtually all of the portion of the island behind the levee is used for agriculture, with the sole exception of the thin line of trees responsible for the deadwood that provides the excellent fish habitat. According to a report produced by the Middle Mississippi River Partnership, a federal-state consortium of river-management organizations, most of the land in the island is \\"prime farmland\\", with the exceptions of occasional areas that would require drainage to become productive.

The Skagen Port Authority is responsible for the harbour's administration. FF Skagen, one of three companies supporting the Danish fish meal industry, has its processing plant on Skagen wharf. The harbour is being adapted to accommodate large international cruise ships. A new berth to be completed by 2015 will also provide facilities for oil bunkering and enhanced facilities for the fishing industry.

History=Early history and background After years of discussion between Skagen's fishermen and the authorities, a commission was finally established in the 1880s, leading to an early proposal for a harbour by Customs Inspector Holm that was not accepted. Under pressure from the fishermen, the Minister of the Interior called on an engineer by the name of Berg to prepare a new proposal in 1888. This led to parliamentary approval on 23 April 1903, followed by a call for tenders on 26 January 1904. On the basis of a bid from Gunnarson & S√∏n og Elzelingen, work was initiated in February 1904 on Skagen's S√∏nderstand (south shore) just outside the town.\\"Havnens historie\\" , Skagen Havn. Retrieved 6 November 2013. The work was supervised by the hydraulic engineer Palle Bruun who had reported on harbours in the Faroe Islands.\\"Palle Bruun\\", Dansk Biografisk Leksikon. Retrieved 6 November 2013. Skagen wharf The design consisted of two breakwaters some apart that stretched out to sea. With their outer extensions providing an entrance some wide, the harbour covered an area of almost . The basin was divided by two cross piers, creating an outer harbour and an inner harbour with an entrance wide. A harbour-master's house, fish warehouse and a customs office were built in parallel. On 19 November 1907, King Frederik VIII ceremonially opened the port in the presence of the Skagen Painters, who had decorated the facilities with flags. Carl Locher had designed an impressive gateway of honour. In May 1908, four fish warehouses on the quayside designed by Thorvald Bindesb√∏ll were opened. In 1932, on the occasion of the harbour's 25th anniversary, Anne Marie Carl-Nielsen's statue of the fisherman and lifeboatman was unveiled. In 1935, Johannes Friis-Skotte, Minister for Transport, announced that the government were funding a 900,000 kr project to expand the harbour towards the east, involving a by basin with a depth of , designed to facilitate fisherman during the process of unloading. As a result, between 1935 and 1938 the harbour was expanded towards the east, and a new auction room was added in 1938, in length and wide, with skylights and seven phone booths. Post-war developments A trawler in Skagen harbour In 1943, the Rigsdag approved 7 million kr proposals to further expand the harbour towards the west. However, due to the German occupation during the war the project was postponed and it wasn't until 1952 that construction began, rising to a budget of 11 million kr. The off-shore area of the port was expanded by and the on-shore area was enlarged by , with some of quay. Between 1964 and 1979, the harbour was further expanded towards the east in a 35 million kr project to facilitate growth at the port, doubling the size of the harbour and providing new facilities for auctioning the catches from the 400 fishing boats registered in Skagen. The off-shore area was enlarged by 14 hectares and the on-shore area with 120 hectares. A new auction room was erected between the fisheries inspection building and the auction office. In 1985, the Auktionsbassin (the Auction Basin) of the port was deepened by some , as was the Vesthavnen (West Harbour) in the early 1990s. In 2001, the Port of Skagen acquired autonomously governed harbour status, after the government sold off several of the national harbours. Under ownership of the municipality, a 12.5 million kr investment was put into deepening the √òstbassin 2 (East Basin 2) and building a new quay to a depth of in its outer part. In 2007, a new dry dock measuring by was built for Karstensen's wharf. Additional facilities for fish processing, including a refrigeration plant, were completed in 2008. Fishing Plaice caught at Skagen The Port of Skagen is Denmark's largest fishing port and the first in Europe for landings of pelagic fish, primarily herring. Founded in 1960, FF Skagen is one of three companies supporting the Danish fish-meal industry; its processing plant is located on Skagen wharf. As of 2011, statistics from the Danish Fisheries Directorate list Skagen Harbour as the leading fishing port in Denmark in terms of both the quantity of catches and their value.\\"Skagen Havn: √Örsberetning 2011\\" . Retrieved 5 November 2013. Statistics for 2013 from NaturErhvervstyrelsen showed a year-on-year increase in fishing takings of 10 percent for a total value of DKK 3.4 billion (c. US $621 million). Harbour director Willy Bent Hansen reported that the Port of Skagen now represented over 25 percent of all fish landed in Denmark. In April 2014, the 86-meter- long supertrawler \\"Gitte Henning\\" landed a record 3,281 tons of whiting in Skagen after returning from its maiden voyage, apparently the largest catch ever in Denmark.

Retrieved 11 October 2013. There are also plans for establishing oil- bunkering facilities for large vessels on the outer section of the new port. In July 2014, Berlingske reported that from 2015 the enlarged harbour was expected to attract up to 40 large cruise ships per year compared to only a dozen smaller ships at present. The larger vessels will carry up to 3,500 passengers. Port of Skagen was covering the cost of the work which amounted to DKK 226 million (US$41 million). The new harbour would provide new jobs increasing the workforce from some 2,000 today to 2,600 on completion.

History  The trust was established as East Sussex Hospitals NHS Trust on 1 April 2002, taking its current name on 13 May 2011. Overview East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust provide acute hospital and community health services for people living in East Sussex and surrounding areas. Their services are mainly provided from two district general hospitals, Conquest Hospital and Eastbourne DGH both of which have Emergency Departments and provide care 24 hours a day. They offer a comprehensive range of surgical, medical and maternity services supported by a full range of diagnostic and therapy services. At Bexhill Hospital they provide outpatients, ophthalmology, rehabilitation and intermediate care services. At Rye, Winchelsea and District Memorial Hospital they provide Outpatient and inpatient intermediate care services. They also provide some services at Uckfield Community Hospital. Their community teams also provide care in the patient‚Äôs own home and from a number of clinics and GP surgeries in East Sussex. There are around 525,000 people who live in East Sussex and the Trust is one of the largest organisations in the county. They employ over 6,000 dedicated staff with an annual turnover of ¬£380 million.Rob Toth, ESHT Communications Manager The Trust has been given ¬£5.05 million to work up detailed plans to develop Bexhill Hospital, Conquest Hospital and Eastbourne DGH over the next decade, as part of the second wave funding round earmarked for 2025-2030 in the government‚Äôs Health Infrastructure Plan which includes 40 hospitals across England. Performance Four-hour target in the emergency department quarterly figures from NHS England Data from https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/ae-waiting-times- and-activity/ In December 2013 the Trust was one of thirteen hospital trusts named by Dr Foster Intelligence as having higher than expected higher mortality indicator scores for the period April 2012 to March 2013 in their Hospital Guide 2013. The Trust predicts a deficit of ¬£19.4m in 2013-14. In April 2014 High Weald Lewes Havens Clinical Commissioning Group served 12 months‚Äô notice on their ¬£18m a year community services contract with the Trust because of concerns about ‚Äúthe access to and consistency of NHS community services‚Äù. A report to the commissioner‚Äôs March board meeting mentioned ‚Äúad hoc and unnotified‚Äù closures of the trust‚Äôs minor injury service, ‚Äúinequitable access‚Äù to district nursing, and ‚Äúintermittent closure‚Äù of a midwifery-led unit. The CCG says the financial problems of the Trust could mean ‚Äúthere is a risk that the provider may seek to take short term decisions that reduce the equitable provision of community services to save cost. Equally, there is a risk that services could be deemed, ‚Äòunsafe‚Äô because of staffing issues.‚Äù The CCGs in Eastbourne and Hastings are continuing their contracts with the Trust, but High Weald are putting their community services contract out to tender. The Care Quality Commission raised concerns over outpatient records and surgical practices at Eastbourne District General Hospital after an inspection in September 2014. It also found that safety and leadership was inadequate. The leaders of the trust were subsequently urged to resign by the East Sussex County Council health overview and scrutiny committee and by Hastings Borough Council. After a further CQC inspection which found a ‚Äúvoid‚Äù between the ‚Äúboard perception‚Äù and ‚Äúreality of working at the trust‚Äù the trust was put into special measures and Stuart Welling, the Chair, resigned. The trust paid a firm called Prederi ¬£45,000 to help with its recovery plan. In February 2016 it was expecting a deficit of ¬£48.7 million for the year. In March 2016 the Trust was ranked bottom in the Learning from Mistakes League. It was put into special measures in October 2016. In February 2018 it was predicting a deficit of over ¬£56 million - just less than 15% of its total income. In November 2018 the Trust to receive ¬£1.7 million funding to implement electronic prescribing. It is anticipated this new electronic prescribing and medicines administration (ePMA) system will be rolled out across the Trust during 2020/2021. In February 2020 The Care Quality Commission (CQC) has rated the Trust as ‚ÄòGood‚Äô overall and ‚ÄòOutstanding‚Äô for providing both ‚ÄòCaring‚Äô and ‚ÄòEffective‚Äô services following their inspection in November and December 2019.

Ships QP 10 consisted of 16 merchant ships. During the voyage, six ships from the Britain-to-Russia convoy PQ 14 joined QP 10 after turning back due to ice and weather damage. The convoy was escorted by the cruiser HMS Liverpool, the destroyers HMS Oribi, Punjabi, Fury, Eclipse, and Marne, the minesweeper Speedwell, and the trawlers Blackfly and Paynter. From 10 April to 12 April the escort was augmented by the Soviet destroyers Gremyashchi and Sokrushitelny and the minesweepers Gossamer, Harrier and Hussar. Between Iceland and Norway a distant covering force was present, consisting of the battleships Duke of York and King George V, the aircraft carrier Victorious, the cruisers Kent and Nigeria, and 12 destroyers, though this force was too far away from the convoy to defend it against submarine and air attacks. Voyage A Ju 88 similar to the ones that attacked QP 10 QP 10 departed Murmansk at 17:00 on 10 April. The first attack on the convoy came on 11 April. Several German Ju 88 bombers appeared overhead, and attacked the convoy. The merchant ship Empire Cowper was hit by three 500 lb bombs and then two more bombs as the ship was being evacuated. HMS Paynter rescued survivors from Empire Cowper, which then sank. The merchant ship Harpalion shot down one of the attacking Ju 88s.

Personal life and education Ahron Daum was born on January 6, 1951 in Bnei Brak, Israel. He was born into a religious Ashkenazi family. His father Schmuel Daum was an important educator, writer, and communal figure, hailing from a prominent rabbinic family from Poland and Bohemia. His mother Rivka Gina Daum hailed from a prosperous trader family in Sopron, Hungary. He has three younger brothers. His intensive religious training began at age 13 in the famous Lithuanian-Chassidic ‚ÄúRuzhin‚Äù Yeshiva in Bnei Brak. At age 14, he left for the UK where he continued his studies at the Yeshiva Ha-Rama and later on moved to the well-known Zionistic Yeshiva Etz Chaim in Montreux, Switzerland. In 1975, after obtaining his Baccalaureate Degree in Switzerland, he went to Jews‚Äô College, University of London, where he obtained a bachelor's degree in Jewish Studies (with Honours). From 1978 he attended the Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary (RIETS '82) of Yeshiva University, New York City where he obtained a master's degree in Biblical Studies (with Honours) and his rabbinical ordination personally signed and handed by Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik. Declining the offer to continue his studies in order to obtain the title of Dayan, he returned to Europe where he married Francine Frenkel with whom he has three daughters. He speaks Hebrew, English, German, French, Dutch and Yiddish and has a passive knowledge of Aramaic and Latin. Rabbinical career In 1982 he started his rabbinical career in Switzerland as a community Rabbi in the town of Biel, a bilingual French/German town. He left this post in 1986 to become a doctoral fellow at the Christlich-J√ºdische Institut in Lucerne, affiliated with the Theological Faculty of the University of Lucerne, Switzerland. In 1987 he accepted the post of Chief Rabbi of the Jewish Community of Frankfurt am Main, Germany, at that time the largest and most prestigious Jewish Community of West Germany. During his tenure ship as Chief Rabbi of Frankfurt there had been a great wave of Russian-Jewish immigrants, streaming from the former Soviet Union to Germany and Frankfurt in particular. The first aid for these people ‚Äì who were mostly in uncertain economic conditions ‚Äì was to integrate them into the Jewish Community. It was Rabbi Daum‚Äôs main priority to integrate these people who had been detached from their Jewish roots for over 90 years. This often proved to be very complex, as in the Soviet Union little to no effort had been done to strengthen their Jewish identity, entailing big difficulties to clarify the Jewish status of these people. Some of these immigrants could not have cared less and thus showed complete apathy towards Jewish life. So, one of the first main tasks as community Rabbi in Frankfurt am Main was to resolve the challenging problem of clarifying the Jewish status of the newcomers from the former Soviet Union. Furthermore, Rabbi Daum had been the driving force in the community regarding religious and cultural activities, not only but especially for the new members of the Jewish Community hailing from the Former Soviet Union. He organized Jewish culture days featuring e.g. Jewish Klezmer music and speakers specializing in the field of religious outreach, adapted to the needs of the new community members from the Former Soviet Union, and heritage tours to places of immense Jewish historical value, cities such as Worms, Mainz, and Michelstadt. During his 5 years time in office as Rabbi of the community in Frankfurt, Rabbi Ahron Daum had been the sole acting Rabbi. He fulfilled the full scope of tasks for the community in Frankfurt, which at that time counted approximately 6000-7000 people. He pulled the strings for all services on Shabbat and festivals, including sermons dealing with contemporary issues. Besides giving regular Torah lessons on Shabbat and weekdays to the members of the community, he regularly visited the four existing synagogues and additionally paid regular visits to the two existing Jewish old-age homes on the occasion of the High Holidays, Chanukkah and Pesach. He regularly took part in funerals and made Shive visits, regardless of the status of the deceased member; known or unknown, rich or poor. He had been supervising the Kashrut of the community institutions, such as the restaurants, the butcher shops, kosher meals for Lufthansa and occasional celebrations, like Bar-/Bat Mitzvahs and marriages in big hotels. Additionally it had been very important for Rabbi Daum to instigate the renovation of the Mikvah according to the high standards of the Halacha. With the support of Rabbi Meir Posen, at that time the greatest Halachical authority on the construction of Mikvahs in Europe, he ensured that the high Halachical standards and the Kashrut of the Mikvah in Frankfurt would be met. Leading not only the yearly communal Passover Seders with several hundred participants, he also organized a community Sukkah for the community members and frequently invited community members to his Shabbat table, not distinguishing between members from the center or the periphery of the community. Together with this father, Shmuel Daum, he regularly organized Kabbalat Shabbat youth-Minyanim in the Baumweg Synagogue and during his time in office he had also been the Av Beth Din of Frankfurt. As such he actively dealt with Giyurim, questions concerning Kashrut, Dinei Torah and religious divorces (Gittin). Regarding Giyurim Rabbi Daum has the experience from both the perspective of a religious Rabbinical judge (Beth Din), as well as a teacher and mentor. He embodies over 15 years of experience preparing non-Jews who wish to become Jewish for their Halachic recognized Giyur. In 1993, for family reasons, he resigned from his post as Chief Rabbi and moved to Antwerp, Belgium, where the largest part of his family already lived. There he started to teach Judaism within the state school system and in Jewish day schools. In 1995 he accepted a position as lecturer in Jewish Law at the Faculty for Comparative Religion in Wilrijk (Antwerp), Belgium. In recognition of his teaching there and his works on Halacha the Faculty awarded him a Professorship Honoris Causa in Jewish Law. Since 2001 he also started, along with his wife, a series of outreach projects for Baalei Tshuva, non-Jews interested in Jewish studies and prospective converts to Judaism. Today this takes up most of his time and efforts and as part of these outreach activities he regularly organizes, in cooperation with the Netherlands-based Shalom Centre, study days on various topics within the field of Jewish studies. Work and publications Rabbi Ahron Daum is a prolific author who has written on a diverse scope of topics within the field of Jewish studies. Whilst living in Switzerland he was a regular contributor of Halachic articles to the Jewish Swiss-German weekly \\"J√ºdische Rundschau\\". During his tenure as Chief Rabbi of Frankfurt am Main, he regularly wrote articles for \\"Die J√ºdische Allgemeine\\" and the bi-monthly magazine \\"Die Gemeinde\\". Since 2010 he writes a monthly column for the magazine Joods Actueel, the most widely circulated Jewish publication in Belgium. In these columns he covers the whole spectrum of Jewish Studies, for example his well-liked series on the history of Judaism since the Enlightenment. He is the author of two books. His first book \\"Halacha aktuell\\" is a two-volume work, written in German, which treats Halachic problems and issues of current interest as they appear in the Halachic literature and more specifically the Responsa. This work is unique in that it was the first book written in German during the post-war period that comprehensively deals with Halachic issues in the Responsa literature. It was therefore welcomed with great enthusiasm in the Halachic world and received approbations from many distinguished Halachic authorities. Certain articles from this book were written in Rabbinic Hebrew and were later separately published under the title \\"Iyunim b‚ÄôHalacha\\". His second book was \\"Die J√ºdische Feiertage in Sicht der Tradition\\" (The Jewish Festivals in View of the Tradition). It is a two-volume anthology combining Halachic articles, sermons, liturgical remarks, homiletic thoughts and folkloric and humorous tales connected to the Jewish holidays and Shabbat. He is presently working on a number of books in Dutch covering such diverse topics as Kabbalah, Jewish History, the contemporary Jewish World and its different affiliations and other issues.

The Parque Nacional Submarino La Caleta (English: La Caleta Underwater National Park) is a national park located approximately 20 kilometres (12 miles) from Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic. It is adjacent to Las Americas International Airport. Created by Decree No. 249 on September 25, 1986, La Caleta Underwater National Park is the first underwater park in the Dominican Republic and is considered by experts to be one of the five best diving locations in the Caribbean. It has a maximum depth of . Many coral reefs can be found between and . It is one of the most visited parks in the country and attracts divers from both the Dominican Republic and other countries. It is classified as an ecotourism park, aimed at the assessment of existing natural resources, while encouraging participants to pursue conservation and respect for nature. The main tourist attraction is the ship Hickory, which was removed in 1984 by Grayson Roach in order to form a habitat for reef fish and a diving destination. Inside the park there is an Ethnological and Archaeological Museum which has a large collection of objects created by the Ta√≠no.  History  At the time of the arrival of conquistadors in 1492, La Caleta was a major Indian settlement. The settlement, known as Herds led Toto, included La Caleta and its surrounding area. According to tradition, it was inhabited by native people who were engaged in fishing and agriculture. In 1972, families living around the \\"little beach\\" were evicted to start the excavation and construction of the Pantheon Archaeological Museum as well as the national park.  Museum- Pantheon and archaeological site  In 1972, the La Caleta Centre was established by the scientific community when archaeologists discovered 373 skeletons of indigenous pre-Columbian people who had inhabited the island of Santo Domingo. The finding was of great importance because the remains were associated with three cultural components that had inhabited the island: Ostionoid, Late Ta√≠no, Late Elenoide. The bones dated from AD 650, 750 and 840. The archaeologists found a second burial mound formed by a child's bones that gave the impression of the child being tied up. These deaths may have been the result of an epidemic. Archaeologists Morban Laucer Fernando, Luis Chanlatte Baik, and Manuel Garcia Arevalo excavated the site over a period of two years, under the auspices of the Dominican Republic government, along with the participation of researchers from the United States and Puerto Rico. Since the inception of La Caleta, both researchers and the government considered creating an archaeological museum for tourists, students and researchers dedicated to the understanding and study of the burial customs of the indigenous people. Eventually, in 1974, the Constitutional Government of President Dr. Joaqu√≠n Balaguer opened the La Caleta Centre and the Archaeological Museum.  Management  La Caleta Park, the only Marine National Park in the Dominican Republic, exists as a national model for community-based coastal marine management. In recognition of its success, the government recently awarded co-management of the La Caleta Park to Reef Check Dominican Republic (RCDR) and its local partners. This empowering of local communities represents a new model for Dominican Republic citizens to sustainably manage and benefit from their coastal ecosystems. The goal is for this model to expand to include networks of community-run marine protected areas, where local priorities are aligned with conservation goals.

In the blank Pages of an Edition of Manuale sacerdotum hoc est, ritus administrandi sacramenta. Printed in Douai 1610. In the Lauinger Library, University of Georgetown Around 1622, the Piscataway tribe, which led the Conoy Federation, built a town they soon called Kittamaqundi on Piscataway Creek near the modern day town of Piscataway, Prince George's County, Maryland. When English first visited the town, in 1634, they learned it was named after the relatively new Tayac (Emperor) Kittamaquund, who had assumed power the previous year after killing his brother Wannas. Etymology Some English translated the Algonkian name Kittamaquund as Chitomachen. One author translated Kittamaqundi as \\"Great Beaver Place\\" and Chitomachen as \\"strong bear\\". History Previously, the Piscataway's principal town (and the site of its cemetery and holy places) had been Moyaone on the Accokeek Creek near the Potomac River, which was abandoned after a fire. Famine and disease in previous years, and retaliation by either the English or tribes in the Powhatan Confederacy could have contributed to Moyaone's abandonment, for Kittamaquund would pursue an assimilation or accommodation strategy with the English. Wahunsenacawh, the former paramount chieftain of the Powhatan Confederacy across the Potomac River, had died in 1618, and in his last years had convinced his subordinate tribes near Jamestown, Virginia (including the Kecoughtan and Chickahominy) to stop trading grain to the English settlers, who he wished would leave. The Piscataway (later called the Piscataway-Conoys), who although speaking a related Algonquin tongue were not under Powhatan's control, remained willing to trade foodstuffs with the English who sailed to their village, since they sought assistance against Susquehannock and Seneca raiders.Thelma Ruskin, Indians of the Tidewater County of Maryland, Virginia, Delaware and North Carolina (Maryland Historical Press, 1986) p. 33 On March 22, 1622, the new war-leader of the Powhatan Confederacy, Opchanacanough, led a series of coordinated attacks on English settlements, nearly wiping out the Jamestown settlement but for warnings given the colonists by natives friendly to them, thus beginning the second Anglo-Powhatan war. In June 1639, Jesuits led by Father Andrew White established a mission at Kittamaqundi. White wrote of curing Kittamaquund and his son of an illness with a combination of a powder, holy water, and blood letting and baptizing a condemned tribesman before execution. On 5 July 1640 Fr. White baptised the chief as \\"Charles\\" and his wife as \\"Mary\\" along with his counselor Mosorcoques' as John. White then married Charles and Mary. The couple entrusted their seven-year-old daughter (also Mary) to Governor Leonard Calvert and his sister-in-law Margaret Brent for education in English ways at St. Mary's City, Maryland. By 1642, six Jesuits lived in the village. The Jesuits abandoned the village in 1643 after Susquehannock raiders took men and supplies. In 1644, as both another Anglo- Powhatan war neared its end and English religious wars spread and nearly obliterated the Maryland colony, English occupied the town as a protective outpost. By 1675, Susquehannock displaced by English settlers had taken over Kittamaqundi's agricultural fields and built a 180 foot long palisade wall. Virginia and Maryland militia led by Major Truman blamed the Susquehannock for killing settlers across the Potomac River in Stafford County, Virginia. Their killing of five Susquehannock chiefs who agreed to a peace parley, as well as the town's destruction, led to revenge killings across the Potomac in Virginia, precipitating Bacon's Rebellion. Piscataway signed a treaty with William Penn in 1701. Many had settled near Conoy (their name to Iroquois- speakers ) creek in Pennsylvania by 1718. In 1704, English settlers laid out the town of Piscataway, Maryland near or on the site of Kittamaqundi. A stained glass at Saint Ignatius Church in nearby Port Tobacco, Maryland depicts Kittamaquund's baptism. Village life Villagers lived in oval tent structures made of hide covered saplings with a central hole for light and ventilation for a fire. Tribe leaders used beds raised above the ground by four posts. Wooded areas would have been cleared by the traditional technique of stripping bark off trees to kill them, then using fire to clear a field. Once cleared, mounds of dirt would host corn comingled with bean plants using the stalks for support. Squash would be grown between the mounds. The river based village would also collect fish and oysters using dugout canoes. Kittamaquund was described as wearing shells to denote his role as leader.

Biography  The Lifeboat is Taken through the Dunes, 1883 From an early age, Kruse took part in many rescues off Skagen's dangerous coasts, helping to save the lives of some 200 people. One of his most heroic exploits was on 27 December 1862 when the Swedish brig Daphne was stranded off the coast to the north. After the lifeboat had capsized and her crew of eight had drowned, Kruse took his own boat out into the storm and saved the ship's crew. He was immediately assigned to the Life-Saving Service, where he was put in charge of Skagen's lifeboat. In 1880, he was awarded a silver cross with the inscription: Ydmyg i Ordet, stolt i sin Daad, kristen i Gjerning, Mand i sin Baad (Humble in speech, Proud in deed, Christian in action, Man in his boat).

It was known as one of the country's fastest courses and many records were broken there. In 1903 history was made at Readville when a five-year-old mare named Lou Dillon became the first trotter to run a two-minute mile. On August 25, 1908 the most spectacular event in all harness horse history was staged, the $50,000 American Trotting Derby won by Allan Winter. History Originally the site of Camp Meigs and training grounds for the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, in 1869 the Norfolk Agricultural Association purchased the land and built a half-mile track. Sold in 1895 to The New England Trotting Horse Breeders Association, the track was renamed the Readville Trotting Park and expanded to a full mile with the addition of a 3,400 seat grandstand, a clubhouse, restaurant, hotel and stable area. Railroad service was added by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad to accommodate Boston, New York and Connecticut spectators.p. 17 By 1899 Grand Circuit harness drivers were competing for a record $10,000 purse. The New York Times proclaimed \\"The August 23rd race was, without question, one of the finest exhibitions ever seen on this or any other track...and the crowd was the biggest yet.\\"New York Times Barney Oldfield and the Green Dragon, Readville Race Track Sept 9, 1905 With the invention of the automobile, the public taste for racing shifted. In 1903 the first auto race was held at Readville. By 1905 ticket sales for \\"gas burners\\", including steam cars, electric cars and motorized bicycles eclipsed those of harness races with 12,000 spectators attending a milestone auto race on Memorial Day. The first recorded stock car race was held at Readville in 1906. At times huge dust clouds would form rendering goggles useless, and all the contestants faces would be covered in dirt. Sturtevant A-3 Battleplane Dec 12, 1915 The B. F. Sturtevant Company's Hyde Park factory shared the adjacent property. Sturtevant's success had allowed them to expand in other areas. Led by B. F. Sturtevant's son-in-law Eugene \\"Noble\\" Foss, on December 12, 1915 the newly formed Sturtevant Aeroplane Company tested its new A-3 Battleplane prototype next door on the Readville field, becoming the first American airplane engineered specifically for air combat. Designed by Grover C. Loening, most recently the Army‚Äôs aeronautical engineer at San Diego and hired by Sturtevant, the A-3 featured a water cooled 140 hp. Sturtevant V-8 engine with two removable 8‚Äô X 2.5‚Äô nacelles positioned mid-wing for machine gunners to fire outside the propeller arc. The concept plane was piloted by Lt. Byron Jones. Remarkably, the Army and Navy had no specific interest in a combat aircraft at the time. So although it was the first of its kind in America, there was no demand or funds to purchase any airplane other than for observation and training. Horse and auto racing continued to coexist until the late 1920s when cars finally won out. In 1926 ownership passed from Charles W. Leonard to the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad. In the early 1930s the track was modified using fill from the newly constructed Sumner Tunnel resulting in a harder surface with steeper banks to accommodate higher speeds. Until closing in May 1937 Readville hosted all the top drivers of the era. By World War II, the site was largely abandoned, although U.S. Navy pilots from Naval Air Station Squantum flying their Stearman biplanes would practice \\"touch and go\\" landings on the remnants of the old oval track.http://www.sturtevantfan.com/Aviation.html  References  External links  *Drivers Race Through Great Banks of Dust at Readville June 18, 1904 *Baldwin Breaks Record at Readville in Newton Steam Car-New York Times 1907 * Pioneers of American Motorcycle Racing *New Track Race Record Mile at Readville *Good Racing at Readville Track - Barney Oldfield over Louis Chevrolet *The Story Behind the Stanley Land Speed Record, 1906 *Bob Perry & Carl Goudy win Readville 300 mile Relay on a 1915 Excelsior *Harness Racing Results at Readville, Los Angeles Herald, July 1902 *Real Racing at Readville Meet - Grant, DePalma, Oldfield, Christie *Decoration Day May 30, 1903 Race of the Steamers attended by crowd of 10,000 *The Esta Manthos Indian Motocycle Collection *Sturtevant Fan Co.

A related analytic tool is known as Prefer.  Details  The database is operated by the following agencies: * United States of America - National Security Agency (NSA) * United Kingdom - Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) The existence of the database was revealed in 2014 based on documents disclosed by whistleblower Edward Snowden. According to Snowden's documents, Britain's Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) has been given full access to the Dishfire database, which the agency uses to obtain personal information of Britons by exploiting a legal loophole.  Scope of surveillance  Each day, Dishfire collects the following amounts of data: * Geolocation data of more than 76,000 text messages and other travel information * Over 110,000 names, gathered from electronic business cards * Over 800,000 financial transactions that are either gathered from text-to-text payments or from linking credit cards to phone users * Details of 1.6 million border crossings based on the interception of network roaming alerts * Over 5 million missed call alerts * About 200 million text messages from around the world The press highlighted some quotes from the internal presentations highlighting the intent of this operation: one leaked GCHQ document said that DISHFIRE ‚Äúcollects pretty much everything it can, so you can see SMS from a selector which is not targeted.‚Äù The bulk collection was therefore suggested in this document as ‚Äúparticularly useful for the development of new targets, since it is possible to examine the content of messages sent months or even years before the target was known to be of interest.‚Äù (emphasis in original) In response, a spokeswoman of the NSA describes the database as follows: \\"Dishfire is a system that processes and stores lawfully collected SMS data. Because some SMS data of US persons may at times be incidentally collected in NSA‚Äôs lawful foreign intelligence mission, privacy protections for US persons exist across the entire process concerning the use, handling, retention and dissemination of SMS data in Dishfire.\\"  Data processing  Dishfire is typically exploited with an analytical tool known as the Prefer program (stylised PREFER), which processes SMS messages to extract information including contacts from missed call alerts, location from roaming and travel alerts, financial information from bank alerts and payments, and names from electronic business cards.  Reactions  A Vodafone representative declared in the breaking news story on Channel 4 that ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the first we‚Äôve heard about it and naturally we‚Äôre shocked and surprised.‚Äù He went on to say that Dishfire was probably circumventing UK law. According to Channel 4's Geoff White, \\"the Dishfire system gives GCHQ a legal loophole to get such information without needing a RIPA request. That's because the text messages are gathered and stored by the NSA - and GCHQ's access to foreign intelligence agencies' stash of data is not covered by any UK law.\\" Former UK Interception Commissioner Sir Swinton Thomas drew an analogy between this method of circumventing the UK interception laws and torture in a foreign country, adding that it was a ‚Äúdifferent area of course, but the concept is very similar‚Äù.

Only one was constructed. Development The Vittoria was designed and built between 1941 and 1942 by Armando Pagliani and two employees of the Luigi Teichfuss glider works at Pavullo nel Frignano Airport. It was a high-wing monoplane, with its single spar wing supported centrally on a fuselage pedestal and braced on each side from the spar at about one third span to the lower fuselage with a single steel faired strut. White deal ribs defined the wing section, which tapered from G√∂ttingen 535 to the reflexed NACA M6 outboard. In plan the wing had a rectangular centre section and straight-tapered outer panels which ended in rounded tips. The trailing edges of the outer panels were almost entirely occupied by the ailerons. The Vittoria had a plywood-skinned, hexagonal-cross-section, wooden-framed fuselage, with deep sides which converged somewhat downwards. Its cockpit was immediately in front of the wing pedestal, beneath a framed canopy which lifted off, reinforced by a small part of the upper fuselage skin, for access. Comfortable seating was in-flight adjustable and the visibility was good. The fuselage tapered markedly rearwards as the pedestal dropped away. A straight- edged, round-tipped tailplane was mounted on top of it, carrying elevators with a notch for rudder movement. The fin was very small but mounted a rounded, broad-chord, balanced rudder which reached down to the keel largely to the rear of the elevators. The glider landed on a sprung skid reaching from the nose to beyond mid-chord, assisted by a generous tail bumper. The Vittoria probably made its first flight in 1942, but little is known of its subsequent history in the Italian Social Republic, except that the sole example was destroyed soon after the Second World War ended in 1945.

The software is a single, free, core package for astronomical utilities due to the increasingly widespread usage of Python by astronomers, and to foster interoperability between various extant Python astronomy packages. Astropy is included in several large Python distributions; it is part of package managers for Linux and macOS, the Anaconda Python Distribution, Enthought Canopy and Ureka.  Development  Around the turn of the millennium the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) started development of Python-based utilities to extend or substitute existing astronomical data analysis tools on a modern, object-oriented platform. Among the first projects were a replacement of the command language for the Image Reduction and Analysis Facility (IRAF) with a Python frontend, and the PyFITS interface to the Flexible Image Transport System. Since the existing Numeric module for handling vectors and arrays in Python turned out to be inadequate for large astronomical datasets, a new library better tuned for large array sizes was subsequently developed at STScI. Both libraries were merged into a new array package by Travis Oliphant in 2005‚Äì2006, creating NumPy, now the de facto standard for numerical data handling in Python. In the following years the existing software packages maintained by STScI as part of their stsci_python suite were ported to NumPy as well. This, together with the more extensive SciPy computing environment, provided a platform to develop customized scripts and applications for a variety of astronomical tasks. By 2011, the use of Python in astronomy had reached significant levels. At the 2012 .Astronomy meeting, 42% of attendees preferred Python according to an informal survey. Many astronomy-related Python packages have been developed over the years, albeit without cooperation or coordination, which led to duplication and difficult interoperability between packages. There was also no easy way install all the required packages needed in an astronomer‚Äôs toolkit. A number of smaller packages are sometimes no longer maintained or unavailable. The Astropy project started in 2011, motivated by these difficulties, and a desire to unite developers in astronomy to coordinate the development of a unified set of Python modules for astronomers, and reduce the confusion of available packages. The Space Telescope Science Institute, operators of the Hubble Space Telescope, are merging the work on Astropy into stsci_python releases.

Early life Grimes was born in August 1945 to a couple who met in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and worked together on the Manhattan Project. She went to school in Los Alamos, then left and did the rest of her schooling in Denver, Colorado. While in high school she enrolled in a course in Russian, in which she excelled and gave her the encouragement to later major in Russian language at the University of Washington in Seattle. CIA career and Aldrich Ames The Central Intelligence Agency team that discovered Soviet mole Aldrich Ames. From left to right: Sandy Grimes, Paul Redmond, Jeanne Vertefeuille, Diana Worthen, Dan Payne. In October 1966, a friend informed her that a CIA recruiter was on campus. He told her she \\"would make a perfect spy.\\" She pursued this due to the fact she desperately needed a job before graduation. Following her interview with the CIA, she was given a position as a GS-06 Intelligence Assistant for which she needed to have security and medical clearances before she could get unrestricted access. When she reported for duty at the Ames building in Rosslyn, Virginia, she and her fellow co-workers became clerical employees. Grimes' first job was working in the Soviet Bloc Division of the Directorate of Operations, which included the intelligence from then Colonel Dmitri Fedorovich Polyakov. She trained herself to become familiar with Soviet intelligence services, during which she used index cards to track counterintelligence and positive intelligence. In Fall 1968, Grimes attended operations training and met SE Division expert Dick Kovich. In 1970, she eventually was granted an interview for conversion to professional status and afterward worked her way up and was given the duty of replacing a senior intelligence analyst in the Branch. She later became a Soviet and Eastern European Division officer and remained with their counterintelligence group for eleven years, holding various titles and positions. It was through this experience that she gained knowledge of the KGB and the GRU. During this time. Grimes worked or assisted in cases which included Aleksey Isidorovich Kulak and Leonid Georgiyevich Poleshchuk. In the late 1970s, through an organizational change in the CI group, she met Jeanne Vertefeuille. Together with Faith McCoy, Grimes and McCoy made a proposal to create two branches in the CI group, both of which to handle CI dissemination and production in a specific geographical region. One would deal with the Soviet bloc and the other the Eastern European bloc. Eventually, the two branches merged, where Vertefeuille was the chief and Grimes became the Soviet section chief. In 1981, after 14 years in CI, Grimes moved to the Career Management Staff after a change in feelings. In early 1983, she eventually moved on to becoming deputy chief of external operations in Africa and two weeks later became acting chief. In early 1984, Grimes was appointed permanent Chief of SE External Operations for Africa. After the arrest of then General Poleshchuk on October 2, 1985, in January 1986, Grimes was part of the attempt to stop CIA assets from being exposed, which was an extraordinary \\"back room\\" security procedure. This role was in addition to Grimes' role of Chief of SE External Operations for Africa. She was eventually brought into a CIA operation in Bonn. An anonymous write-in, involving a person named Mister. X, mentioned that the Soviet sources of the CIA were compromised due to a penetration of the CIA communications. The author demanded $50,000 in a cache or dead drop in East Berlin. In March 1987, Grimes was transferred from her position in Africa and was assigned to the Moscow Task Force. Moscow Embassy Marine Guard Arnold Bracy and Clayton Lonetree allowed the KGB entry to the secure areas within the U.S. Embassy. In 1989, Grimes moved from being Chief of the Production Branch to a part-time position in the Special Projects Section. In early 1991, she was working on GTPROLOGUE when she was offered the assignment to investigate the 1985 loss of Polyakov and others. During a joint mole-hunt, Grimes was a member of the team who made the first breakthrough in 1992. She correlated times that Ames met with Sergey Dmitriyevich Chuvakhin, his KGB contact, with times that he made large bank deposits in 1985 and 1986. In early 1993, Grimes resigned from the CIA.

Being the first of the Bert Diaries, the term \\"Berts dagbok\\" has later even become a term for the entire Bert Universe. Created to be older and tougher than Sune, the idea of writing as a diary novel was inspired from Barbro Lindgrens \\"V√§rldshemligt\\", but during the Gothenburg Book Fair a person appeared, telling the concept had been taken from The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13¬æ. The episodes were originally written during the spring of 1986 for SR √ñrebro. S√∂ren Olsson was originally supposed to read the chapters before Anders Jacobsson took over. When it was thought to sound too much like Sune, before S√∂ren took over again. Depicting an ordinary Swedish guy called Bert Ljung, he is an \\"ordinary\\" guy except for one thing, he writes a diary. However, he doesn't tell it for someone. The dates follow the 1987 almanac of the Gregorian Calendar, and the finishing lines for each chapter are \\"Klart slut ‚Äì varulvstjut\\" (). The book is the Bert book that has been spread most outside Sweden (as of 2009). Book cover The original 1987 book cover is blue, with a white skull and crossbones. The 1993 revised and expanded edition (pictured) depicts Bert sitting with the 1987 edition in his hand, with the word \\"Berts\\" crossed out and replaced with Trebs. In the air, almanac dates fall down, and two heart symbols are depicted, with the names \\"Nadja Nilsson\\" and \\"Rebecka\\", and the text Rebecka crossed out. Bert wears a green sweater, and in the airs are also the words \\"Mr. Walker\\" and \\"Klart slut ‚Äì varulvstjut\\". Plot The book opens with the words: translated: Berts dagbok is set during the spring term in the 5th grade, and runs from 14 January to 4 June. Bert, in class 5A at Beckaskolan is ashamed of his name, and originally uses the Treb Walker persona. Treb is Bert backward, Walker comes from The Phantom whose name is Kit Walker. Bert also writes his own stories, about the hero Kob√•j-Kurt. Bert and √Öke also have invited their own fictional country, \\"Hoppalotjingien\\", which later in the book ceases to exist following a \\"civil war\\". When the book opens, Bert is in love with Rebecka in 5 B and turns to red pencil each time he writes about love, but when Klimpen during Bert' s 12th birthday party during late February tricks Bert into smacking a rubber snake into Rebecka 's butt, and she walks home. This is followed by a period from late February when Bert doesn't care much for girls at all, creating more space for other plots. Among them are √Öke Nordin \\"experimenting \\" on his little sister Doris, who he tricks into drinking a \\"dishwashing liquid drink\\", class 5 A plays soccer against class 5 B, and Bert's sight problems are discovered. When Bert gets glasses, he is teased by Klimpen. During a May Friday evening school dance event, Bert falls in love with Nadja Nilsson in class 5 E at Jungberska skolan. Torleif tells Bert that she plays the violin in the same orchestra, and that she lives near the soccer ground in a little cottage with her mother and three brothers. Bert calls Nadja and talks to her, originally using √Öke's name. Bert's grandmother says that being kind and polite allows you to get wishes from God, and Bert puts on his best clothes, watches out of the apartment window, and wishes to get together with Nadja Nilsson. Bert thinks that God twinkles with a star. During the next school dance, Torleif tells Bert's name to Nadja, but they manage to agree to meet. As the 5th grade goes towards its end, it's announced that Klimpen will move to Motala. During an experiment, √Öke manages to set fire to the remaining pages of Bert's diary. The book ends with Bert and Nadja meeting in the town park on 4 June under an old oak tree, and in its trunk, they carve their initials (NN + BL). And the end, Bert announces his real name, Bert Ljung, and that Treb Walker is no more. Original edition and revision S√∂ren Olsson illustrated the original edition, as he did with Sune. It was the only Bert book illustrated by him, and the 1993 reissue was illustrated by Sonja H√§rdin. The 1993 reissue has more chapters and is fit to work better with later books and declare things appearing in later books. For example, it's depicted how Lill-Erik moves from Sundsvall, and Emilia Ridderfjell appears in the background, despite the character originally being created for Berts ytterligare betraktelser, where it's told she has been a classmate with Bert for all years. It's also the reissue that first mentions her last name, \\"Ridderfjell\\", for the first time. The 1993 reissue opens with a review of class 5 A at Beckaskolan, and it's here Bert's schoolteacher's first and last names (Sonja Ek) are mentioned for the first time, before that she was just referred to as \\"fr√∂ken\\" (\\"Miss\\"). Later adaptions The book introduces a lot to the Universe of Bert, like the family, his neighbors, and the party. The party, which has become a famous scene, also appears in the TV series, in the episode \\"N√§rkontakt i sj√§tte klassen\\", and the comics.FF med Bert 3 1993, page 5‚Äì9: Tidsmaskinen, Semic Press AB, 1993 Lill-Erik's arrival to the class has also become famous, despite not appearing in the original version. However, it appears in both the TV series and the comics. First, everyone thinks Erik is a tough guy, that can beat up Klmimpen, called Stor-Erik or Erik the Great after kings in Sweden, or the Vikings.FF med Bert 2 1993, page 5‚Äì9: Erik the Great, Semic Press AB, 1993 The story where Bert's myopia is discovered, leading to him getting glasses and getting teased by Klimpen, also appears in the episode Den ohyggligt fule of the TV series. However, TV series doesn't use the \\"bauta bacillus\\" that is supposed to have given Bert myopia. The 1993 reissue also includes a school discoth√®que with a masquerade, which has become famous and appears in the TV series episode \\"Min √§lskling, du √§r som en tulipan\\", and the comics.FF med Bert 4 1993, page 5‚Äì9: Tjejragg och raggarbrorsor, Semic Press AB, 1993 The Bert comic album Charm√∂r p√• danshum√∂r is based on Bert's dagbok. Audiobook Audio recordings were released to cassette tape in 1991 by the √Ñnglatroll label entitled \\"Berts dagbok\\". and \\"Berts dagbok om Nadja\\". There are no music and songs on the tapes, except the sung opening lines \\"Min dagbok, Berts dagbok\\". Translations In 2001 the book was translated into English by Kevin Read, as In Ned's Head, with the closing lines \\"Bye, Bye Apple Pie\\". Geographical places were relocated, and names transliterated becoming \\"Nadia\\" and \\"Rebecca\\", while Klimpen become \\"Nugget\\".DC Public Library ‚Äì In Ned's Head.

It was located east of Bridgeville on State Highway 36 on the west bank of Van Duzen Creek in Larabee Valley. The site of Fort Baker has been obliterated by frequent flooding. Fort Baker was established by Col. Francis J. Lippitt, commander of the Humboldt Military District as one of a number of posts to protect the settlers. It was the center of continued aggressive patrolling that finally forced Lassic and his Wailaki band to surrender on July 31, 1862, at Fort Baker. More of his warriors plus those of other bands came in on August 10 and the 212 captured Indians at Fort Baker were sent to join 462 others at Fort Humboldt. After the 850 captured hostiles were sent to the Smith River Reservation it was believed the war was nearly over. However Lassic and other warriors escaped and the war continued. On September 7, 1863, Fort Baker was recommended for closure, to be replaced by Fort Iaqua.

In September 2006, he founded the Centre for Behavioural Medicine at UCL, which he continues to lead. Horne was designated a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians Faculty of Pharmaceutical Medicine in 2013 and is a founding fellow of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain. He was appointed as a National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Senior Investigator in 2011. He is an internationally recognised expert in self-management of chronic illness and adherence to medications. Biography= Career  Horne qualified as a pharmacist and has a PhD in medical psychology from King's College London. Before joining UCL, Horne was Professor of Psychology in Health Care and Director of the Centre for Health Care Research at the University of Brighton. Horne founded and is Director of the Centre for Behavioural Medicine, which is part of the UCL School of Pharmacy. The overall aim of the Centre is to make healthcare more efficient by understanding and addressing the psychological and behavioural factors explaining variation in response to treatment.  Academic research  Horne's academic research focuses on the role of psychological and behavioural factors in explaining the variation in patients‚Äô response to medication. He has developed a range of tools and models for assessing patients‚Äô perspectives of illness and treatment e.g. the Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ) and Medication Adherence Report (MARS) as well as frameworks for understanding treatment-related behaviours with a particular focus on adherence to medication e.g. the Necessity-Concerns Framework and Perceptions and Practicalities approach. To date, these tools have been validated in the following long-term medical conditions: renal dialysis; renal transplantation; asthma; cancer; coronary heart disease; hypertension; diabetes; HIV/AIDS; haemophilia; depression; bipolar disorder; rheumatoid arthritis; inflammatory bowel disease and also for newly prescribed medications in primary care. His current research focuses on the development of theory-based interventions to support informed choice and optimal adherence to medication or other treatments in chronic illness. Other research interests include emotion and health and the placebo effect. Over the past decade, his research has generated over 140 peer-reviewed publications and book chapters, and grants over ¬£7 million.  Health policy contributions  Horne and his research team regularly contribute to UK and international reports and guidelines on adherence, and to consultancy for national charities, the NHS and commercial health organisations. Professor Horne‚Äôs recent contributions to health policy include adherence guidelines for the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) published in 2009 and a report for the National Co- ordinating Centre for NHS Service Delivery and Organisation R&D; (NCCSDO) published in 2005.  Application of research  In November 2011, Horne co- founded a UCLBusiness spinout company. The company, called Spoonful of Sugar, applies Horne's research to behavioural change consultancy, evidence-based adherence support, validated behavioural research and perspectives mapping and personalised communications.  Medical innovation  Horne is an Academic Fellow of the Centre for the Advancement of Sustainable Medical Innovation (CASMI), a partnership between Oxford University and UCL created to develop new models for medical innovation. In November 2012, Horne was appointed as UCL's academic lead for CASMI.

Initially, he was a strong and influential supporter of the king's son, Duke Stephen, later returned to B√©la's allegiance. Biography He was born into the Buz√°d branch of the gens (clan) Hah√≥t as the son of Buz√°d II, who served as ban of Severin between 1226 and c. 1232.Zsoldos 2011, p. 49. Cs√°k had three brothers. His father was killed by the Mongols in Pest after the disastrous Battle of Mohi.Mark√≥ 2006, p. 451. Cs√°k I had five sons, including Cs√°k II, from an unidentified wife.Mark√≥ 2006, p. 356. Cs√°ktornya (today ƒåakovec, Croatia) His name was first mentioned by a document in 1234. Albeit that charter proved to be a 14th-century forgery, its genealogical details are correct, which suggested he was born around 1215.T√≥th 1976, p. 207. He functioned as master of the horse from 1245 to 1247. Besides that he also served as isp√°n (comes) of Baranya County in 1245.Zsoldos 2011, p. 57. Cs√°k was the isp√°n of Sopron County between 1247 and 1254. According to a non-authentic charter he also held that office until 1260 or 1265 (depends on the uncertain date).Zsoldos 2011, p. 198. As isp√°n, he owned the lands of Wulkaprodersdorf (Vulkapord√°ny), Rohrbach (Frakn√≥n√°dasd), Eggendorf, Hidegs√©g and Homok, nearby the town of Sopron. Historian Melinda T√≥th claimed Hidegs√©g functioned as Cs√°k's manorial seat, when held the office of isp√°n in Sopron County.T√≥th 1976, p. 202. T√≥th also argued, the mural paintings (frescos) in the rotunda of Hidegs√©g, which is an important artistic heritage from the 13th century in Hungary, were made under the financial support of Cs√°k.T√≥th 1976, p. 206. Cs√°k was appointed master of the treasury by king B√©la IV in 1248 and filled the office until 1259. In addition, he also functioned as isp√°n of Zala County between 1256 and 1259.Zsoldos 2011, p. 63. In this capacity, he founded a Premonstratensian monastery in Rajk, dedicated to Blessed Virgin Mary.T√≥th 1976, p. 199. Alongside Ban Stephen Gutkeled, Palatine Roland R√°t√≥t and Benedict II, Archbishop of Esztergom, he participated in peace talks with the envoys of Ottokar II of Bohemia over the issue of Styria in April 1254 in Buda, representing B√©la. When Stephen was made Duke of Styria in 1258, two neighboring counties‚ÄîVas and Zala‚Äîwere transferred to the newly occupied province. Thus isp√°n Cs√°k became Stephen's subject. He successfully defended the fort of Lockenhaus (L√©ka) against Bohemian troops. After the Battle of Kressenbrunn in July 1260, B√©la IV was forced to renounce of Styria in favor of Ottokar II. Cs√°k returned to Hungary and participated in the campaign against Bulgaria in 1261.T√≥th 1976, p. 196. During that time there were emerging tensions between B√©la IV and his son, Stephen, who returned to Transylvania and started to rule it for the second time as Duke of Transylvania after 20 August 1260. Cs√°k gradually became an ardent admirer of Stephen, who dismissed voivode Ernye √Åkos from that position and replaced him with Cs√°k I Hah√≥t.Engel 2001, p. 382. His proper title was \\"ban of Transylvania\\" (). Historian Gyula Krist√≥ suspected deliberateness behind that unusual title (Ernye also bore that before Cs√°k). Krist√≥ argues Duke Stephen wanted to ensure to Transylvania a high degree of autonomy, like in Croatia and Slavonia.Zsoldos 2011, p. 38. He also served as isp√°n of Szolnok County, which office was united with the voivodeship from that time.Engel 2001, p. 144. Before that Cs√°k already held important offices in the royal court of Stephen: he was master of the treasury (1259)Zsoldos 2011, p. 75. and master of the cupbearers (1260) for the duke.Zsoldos 2011, p. 73. He also functioned as isp√°n of Zala County (Western Hungary) in 1260, which fact gives rise to uncertainty regarding his career, because around that time the hostility between father and son, who dominated the eastern part of the country turned into open war.Zsoldos 2011, p. 232. Historian Attila Zsoldos considered Cs√°k left the ducal court and swore allegiance to B√©la, when a civil war lasting until 1266 broke out between father and son.Zsoldos 2007, p. 109. After the Battle of Isaszeg in March 1265, the king was forced to accept the authority of Stephen at Transylvania. On 23 March 1266, father and son confirmed the peace in the Convent of the Blessed Virgin on the 'Rabbits' Island. During that time Cs√°k became a noble in the king's court again. He served as isp√°n of Zala County (1265‚Äì1268). According to Zsoldos, Cs√°k was one of the barons, who advocated another war against Duke Stephen, but the mobilized royal servants in Esztergom refused their participation in 1267. Throughout the first half of the year 1268, Cs√°k stayed in Zala County, where he functioned as isp√°n, where acted as arbiter in a series of lawsuits, which reviewed the ownership of several possessions in the county. One of the articles of the Decree of 1267 ordained that \\"the lands of the nobles, which thou art ours, the peoples of the queen's free villages, or the courtiers, or the castle folks, are occupied or kept occupied under any pretext, must be returned to these nobles\\". By the second half of 1268, Cs√°k moved to Veszpr√©m County with the same mandate.Sz≈±cs 1984, pp. 376‚Äì377. He served as isp√°n of Nyitra County in 1269.Zsoldos 2011, p. 176. His property in Sopron County was divided between his sons according to a business contract in 1274, implying that Cs√°k's death occurred not long before.T√≥th 1976, p. 202. Legacy In order to protect his possessions at Murak√∂z (today: Meƒëimurje, Croatia), he built a timber fortification, establishing the foundation of Cs√°ktornya (lit. means \\"Cs√°k's Tower\\"), which administratively belonged to Zala County (today: ƒåakovec, Croatia).Engel 1996, p. 291.

He is a noted scholar of pre-modern Malay literature,e.g. Hikayat Raja Pasai, Kuala Lumpur: Yayasan Karyawan, 1999. particularly when it comes to relating the texts to the manuscripts. His other interests include foreign influences on Malay and Indonesian, the Chinese in the Nanyang, and the history of papermaking. His current research is focused on the paper and watermarks of Malay manuscripts.  Life and career  His involvement with Indonesia and Malaysia resulted from the fortunate accident of being posted to South East Asia as a young soldier. He was born in England, near the Welsh border, and brought up on a farm in Shropshire. He left school at the age of 16, and since it was during World War II, at the age of eighteen he enlisted in the Royal Marines. A posting to Singapore in 1945, then to Batavia (Netherlands Indies), inspired a lasting interest in Malay and Indonesian. Being inspired to learn more about the Malay world he had discovered, on returning to England he studied Malay at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London. For ten years, from 1948, he served in the Colonial Service, serving in the Federation of Malaya Immigration Department. He was stationed amongst other places in Perlis and Kelantan, and in 1950 had the task of introducing immigration control for the first time in Johor. This was the time of the Emergency (the communist uprising), and security matters inevitably impinged on the work of the Immigration Department. For the latter part of his service he held the post of Senior Assistant Controller of Immigration at the headquarters in Penang. His interest in Chinese arose during this period. He acquired a knowledge of the Hokkien dialect of Chinese (Minnanhua), and took the government examinations in spoken Amoy Hokkien following private tuition in Singapore and Penang. This enabled him to introduce a system of recording Chinese names in the department, based on the Chinese characters, and eventually led to the publication of a book on Chinese names,Chinese Names: The Traditions Surrounding the Use of Chinese Surnames and Personal Names, Kuala Lumpur: Pelanduk Publications, 1997. and another on Chinese loan-words in Malay and Indonesian.Chinese Loan-words in Malay and Indonesian: A Background Study, Kuala Lumpur: University of Malaya, 2009. Returning to Europe after Merdeka, he resumed his studies which included Malay, Dutch and Arabic languages, and Islamic history, in the School of Oriental and African Studies, followed by three years of doctoral research at the University of Leiden. In 1961 he went to Australia, where he taught in the University of Sydney until 1965. His subsequent academic career until he retired in 1984 was in SOAS, University of London, where he is an honorary Research Fellow still. Altogether he has published about sixty articles and books. In 1973 he was instrumental in founding the international Indonesian Etymological Project, which gathered a corpus of about twenty thousand loan-words in Indonesian and Malay, leading to the publication of a book in 2007,Loan-words in Indonesian and Malay (as General editor), Leiden: Koninklijk Instituut voor Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde, 2007. and embodied in a web site in Bangkok, http://sealang.net/indonesia. Also in 1973 he was instrumental in founding a newsletter which over the years has been transformed into the academic journal Indonesia and the Malay World, published by Routledge. The preparation of his PhD, on the legend of the Sufi, Ibrahim ibn Adham, rested extensively on Malay (and some Arabic) manuscript sources.Hikayat Sultan Ibrahim ibn Adham, Berkeley: University of California, 1985. This and subsequent research into Malay manuscripts, nearly all written on Dutch or British or Italian paper, brought a realisation of the need to study the watermarks to establish the date they were written, or copied. He soon found that this science of filigranology has a way of becoming an all-consuming passion for those who take it up. After more than forty years‚Äô devoted to filigranology of Malay/Indonesian manuscripts he has become something of an authority - perhaps the only one - on this neglected field and as he approaches the end of his working life he is dedicating himself single-mindedly to passing on his knowledge to the next generation of Indonesian and Malay codicologists. In retirement, he lives in Cornwall, England.

It is the oldest Globetrotters Club after the British \\"Globetrotters Club\\". History In 1974 the club was founded by Ludmilla T√ºting, Friedemann von Engel, Lutz Fehling, Norbert Denninghaus, Erich Dr√∂nner, Peter Fritze, Werner G√∂cke, Wolfgang K√∂hler, Reinhold Korte and Hannelore Vasel. Serving as a model was the \\"Globetrotters Club\\" established in 1948 in England. The idea and name came from Ludmilla T√ºting, who dedicated the classic 1972 globetrotter handbook Von Alaska bis Feuerland (\\"From Alaska to Tierra del Fuego\\") to \\"the first German club for globetrotters\\". This alternative travel guide has sold 70,000 copies. At a 1974 meeting in Hagen the association was founded. Overall membership since inception is around 2900 individuals. In the 1990s the then Chairman embezzled some of the club's cash. He openly stated this fact himself in front of the General Assembly, resigned from the Club and repaid the entire amount. Deutsche Globetrotter-Zentrale The similarly named \\"Deutsche Globetrotter-Zentrale\\" ‚Äî later Internationale Globetrotter-Zentrale ‚Äì Interglo, then Globetrott-Zentrale ‚Äî had no connections to Deutsche Zentrale f√ºr Globetrotter. Bernd Tesch used the name in 1975 initially as a brand for his guide book and later established a shop for globetrotter equipment in Kornelim√ºnster in Aachen.Vermarktetes Abenteuer. In: Die Zeit. Nr. 15/1978. Goals The club's goals are the collection and sharing of information, finding travel partners, assistance in the preparation of world travel, the reintegration into the company for long-term travel, unifying thoughts, as well as the Association's work. The Club serves as a haven for like-minded between trips. Among the members are backpackers, Saharan travelers, recreational vehicle travelers, outdoor recreation enthusiasts, long-distance and back country backpackers, campers, travel cyclists, hitchhikers, long- distance motorcycle riders, and Unimog operators. Because such travel may be incompatible with professional life, many Globetrotters connect profession and passion and work in tourism, travel book writing, journalism, work as pilots, sell travel supplies, or work as tour guides. The activities of DZG are carried out voluntarily, commercial interests are not pursued. Service for non-members is provided at cost price. A member list, accessible to members only, provides a register of destinations and contact information for other members. Publications The magazine Der Trotter has been published since 1975. The pace of publication is bi-monthly since 2007. So far, about 14,000 editorial pages have appeared. Topics are about 50% travel reports, travel book reviews, schedules, invitations and reports from the Globetrottertreffen meeting, background articles on the individual travel and Association releases. DZG has operated a Web site since 1996. It contains a public forum of globetrotter travel partner search, background information about the purpose of the Association, information entry to the prepare for travel, book reviews, as well as a member's area. It contains country information, trip reports and downloads of the member magazine.  Globetrottertreffen  Since 1974, DZG has organized Globetrottertreffen in Germany. The annual summer meeting takes place on the last weekend of June in Hachenburg, Westerwald forest. In addition to bonfire and talks, slide shows and flea market, workshops and readings by authors of travel books take place. There are in addition about 12 regional meetings, an autumn meeting in the Eifel mountains and a winter meeting in the Weser Uplands. Travel guide The Selbstreise- Handbuch (roughly translated as \\"Do-it-yourself travel guide\\") arose after inquiries since foundation of the club. Common interests were first answered with loose pages such as the \\"cheap flight list\\" by Udo Schwark, then ethnologist Peter Meyer bundled 1984 to the \\"info folder\\", after the ninth edition in 1998 it was replaced by Selbstreise-Handbuch in two volumes, created by Norbert L√ºdtke on behalf of DZG, published by Peter Meyer Verlag, Frankfurt am Main.  Notable members  * Heinz Rox-Schulz, founder of Abenteuermuseums together with Oskar Lafontaine * Werner Freund founder of the Werner Freund Expedition Museum and Wolf Park in Merzig * Jochen Bludau * Gerhard Lenser * Gunther von Hagens * Heinz Scheidhauer * Claus von Carnap- Bornheim * Gerhard Klingenberg * Rudolph Chimelli The Club and its members took on a 'pioneer' role. Many members wrote about their travel experiences not only in Der Trotter, but also in published travel guides. Their books fundamentally influenced the market of travel literature with series and publishers still known today. The earliest individual travel guides were brought together in the series Globetrotter schreiben f√ºr Globetrotter (\\"Globetrotters write for Globetrotters\\"), written by Brigitte Blume, Friedemann von Engel, Rainer L√∂ssl, Jens Peters, Rolf Schettler, Heribert Seul, and Ludmilla T√ºting. Authors and self-publishers of this group joined together in 1984/1985 and created the Verlegergemeinschaft Individuelles Reisen e. V. (VIR) (\\"Publishers' community individual travel company\\") with Helmut Hermann, Edgar Hoff, Peter Rump, Sigrid & wil Tondok and in 1976 they founded Peter Meyer Verlag. From this emerged the Verlagsgruppe Reise Know-How (\\"travel know-how publishing group\\"). Peter Meyer Verlag acts again independently since 1991 and was the first who provided his travel books with handle brands worldwide. The members Udo Schwark and Gisela Walther were the first to translate the Lonely Planet travel guide from English and moved to the Gisela Walther Verlag in 1981. Founders Stefan Loose, Michael M√ºller, Conrad Stein were also members of DZG. A number of other members became known after they started selling travel equipment and now dominate this sector of the economy. Klaus and Erika D√§rr opened the first retail store of the globetrotter scene in Munich in 1975 with expedition equipment. Wolfgang Maas and Gerhardt Lauche founded expedition equipment company Lauche and Maas in 1976 in Munich. Klaus Denart founded Globetrotter Ausr√ºstung (\\"Globetrotter equipment\\") in Hamburg in 1979 as the first North German supplier, and is today the largest travel supplier in Europe.

Functionality Once installed and enabled, Lightbeam records all tracking cookies saved on the user's computer through the Firefox browser by the various sites that the user visits. It differentiates between \\"behavioural\\" tracking cookies (those which record specific actions on a site) and other tracking cookies. At any time during a browsing session the user can open a separate tab, using the \\"Show Lightbeam\\" option of Tools, to display a graph of sites visited and cookies placed.

Lightbeam will also allow the user to see which advertisers or other third parties are connected to which cookies, and thus can develop information about the user's browsing from site to site. Mozilla emphasizes that it displays its data in real time. According to Mozilla, all data collected by Lightbeam is stored locally, and is not shared with anyone, unless the user intentionally exports the data and shares it manually. Future versions may include provisions to reject or delete tracking cookies as well as monitoring them. TED presentation Gary Kovacs, CEO of Mozilla, presented Collusion in a TED talk (Technology, Entertainment, Design) in early 2012. \\"Collusion will allow us to pull back the curtain and provide users with more information about the growing role of third parties, how data drives most Web experiences, and ultimately how little control we have over that experience and our loss of data.\\" Kovacs wrote in a Mozilla blog post about the TED talk. Reactions Writing for ExtremeTech, Sebastian Anthony found the tracking connections revealed by Collusion to be \\"quite astonishing\\". He went on to say that: \\"Now, you can either use Collusion to shock and appall yourself, or you can use it to show friends and family just how rampant behavioral tracking is. Once your mother sees that no less than five companies track her behavior when she visits MSNBC.com, and six when she visits FoxNews.com, she might be a little more cautious.\\" \\"Ms Smith\\" finds the results of Collusion to be \\"jaw dropping\\". Stephen C. Webster, writing for The Raw Story wrote of the information provided by Collusion: \\"While it doesn‚Äôt sound all that creepy, just wait until you see your own graph. A brief test- run by Raw Story revealed that after clicking a number of popular websites ‚Äî like Comedy Central, Netflix, Hulu, the Conan O‚ÄôBrien show, Amazon, The New York Times and others ‚Äî more than three dozen organizations were tracking our movements across multiple websites.\\" History and plans Collusion was originally developed by Atul Varma, a Mozilla engineer, as an independent project. It was later adopted as a Mozilla project. Mozilla had announced that they would be continuing the development of Collusion with support from the Ford Foundation in 2012. However, beginning in October 2019, they ended official support in favour of built in Enhanced Tracking Protection in Firefox.

These were the first elections which the Serbs of Northern Kosovo participated in since the Republic of Kosovo declared independence in 2008; polls were monitored by the OSCE. There were violent reactions in Serb-majority areas of northern Kosovo. Results 1st round *The Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) won in Drenas, Ka√ßanik, Sk√´nderaj and Shtime. *The Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) candidates received the most votes in Fush√´ Kosov√´/Kosovo Polje, Istog/Istok and Podujevo. *The Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (AAK) in coalition with Democratic League of Dardania (LDD) won in De√ßan/Deƒçani. *The Turkish Democratic Party of Kosovo won in Mamusha. *The independent candidate Rufki Suma (supported by Vet√´vendosje!) won in Hani i Elezit.Thirteen candidates win in the first round (in Albanian) *Serb Civic Initiative won in Leposaviƒá, Zveƒçan, and Zubin Potok. *The rest of communes went into the second round. Incidents in Northern Kosovo In August 2013, members of the \\"Interim Assembly of the Autonomous Province of Kosovo-Metohija\\" voted on a statement that said the election would violate Serbian law. This statement was rejected by the governments of Kosovo and of Serbia. Since Kosovo declared independence in 2008, government in these Serb- majority municipalities in the north of Kosovo has been funded by Serbia, and they have been dominated by organised crime and paramilitaries. In the predominantly Serb area of Northern Kosovo, local Serb hardliners campaigned for a boycott of the elections. Voter intimidation was reported. Right before the election day, on Saturday night, a group of people attacked and severely injured the G.I.Srpska candidate for northern Mitrovica Krstimir Pantiƒá in front of his house in Koloshin street; he was taken to hospital. The entire political spectrum condemned the attack. Though the perpetrators were not found, Pantiƒá pointed to the pro-boycott groups, who were not interested in official representation of Serbs within Kosovo. On election day, there were incidents and clashes with police, after extremists raided several polling stations and spoiled votes. Staff were assaulted, ballot boxes smashed, and tear gas canisters set off. This disruption caused the elections to be annulled in three polls in northern Mitrovica, repeated on November 17. The government of Serbia had encouraged Serbs in North Kosovo to participate in the elections, but this violence undermined attempts to normalise relations between the two governments. According to the OSCE the voter turnout was 22% in Leposaviƒá, 22% in Zubin Potok and 11.21% in Zveƒçan. Oliver Ivanoviƒá called for the results in the northern four municipalities to be annulled.\\"Elections in north should be annulled\\" - B92 Following Foreign Minister Enver Hoxhaj declarations that \\"the mayors in the north should be of Serbian ethnicity\\", the Albanian opposition accused the government and DPK for having intentionally facilitated the defeat of Albanian candidates for the sake of stimulating the Serbian citizens in the north, despite their low voter turnout. Partial repetition in Northern Mitrovica The partial revoting in three polls of Northern Mitrovica on 17 November was quiet without any notable incident. The result reconfirmed G.I.Srpska had the plurality, pushing the municipality elections into the second round on 1 December.https://www.citsee.eu/blog/north-kosovo-new-reality-old-problems Results 2nd round The media reported a turnout of 41.5%, while the official statement after the closing of polls from the Central Election Commission chairwoman Valdete Daka gave a turnout of 39.87%. *New Kosovo Alliance (AKR) won in Gjakova (ƒêakovica) with Mimoza Kusari Lila, former Minister of Commerce, becoming the first female mayor in the history of the new country. The same New Kosovo Alliance (AKR) (supported by Democratic League of Kosovo) won in Mitrovica. *Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) won in Gjilan, Lipjan, Pej√´/Peƒá, Suva Reka, Ferizaj (Uro≈°evac), and Viti/Vitina. *Vet√´vendosje! won in Prishtina, where LDK had previously ruled since ever. *Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) won in Dragash, Klina, Kamenica, Rahovec, Prizren, and Vushtrri. *Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (AAK) in coalition with Democratic League of Dardania (LDD) won in Obiliƒá, and Junik. *Serb Civic Initiative won in Novo Brdo, Gracanica, Ranillug, Klokot, Partesh (result got suspended by the CEC due to irregularities and partial repetition established for two weeks later), and Northern Mitrovica. *Independent Liberal Party (SLS) won in ≈†trpce. *Civic Initiative for Malisevo () led by former KLA leader and politician Fatmir Limaj, won in Malisheva. Incidents during the Second Round Incidents similar to Northern Mitrovica during the first round we reported in Partesh during the second round, where groups of persons entered the voting polls and destroyed the materials. The Central Election Commission reordered re-voting in three polls to be held in December 15, 2013, before finalizing the results for this municipality. Other controversies sprang in Prishtina, where a video of Isa Mustafa's son trying to buy votes were registered and distributed to the media from a VV! activist. Partial repetition in Partesh The repetition took place in Pasjan village on December 15. 1304 voters (68.78%) participated. G.I.Srpska won over SLS with 52.4%.

It lies on the territory of the municipality of Sankt Martin (Palatinate) in the county of S√ºdliche Weinstra√üe in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate. After the Kalmit (673 m), the Kesselberg (662 m) and the Ro√überg (637 m) it is the fourth highest peak in the Palatine Forest.  Location  The mountain lies south of two other mountains, the Breitenberg and the H√ºttenberg, that are also part of the Kalmit massif and are located between the valleys of St. Martiner Tal in the north and Edenkobener Tal in the south. In addition to the main summit there is also a subpeak to the southeast, the Strau√üenberg (583 m). To the east the massif drops down to the Rhine Plain, its foothills including the Kropsburg (334 m), the Heidelberg (338 m) and the Werderberg (350 m) with its peace monument. To the west of the mountain is the Schafkopf (617 m), with which it is linked via a saddle by the St. Martiner Hut (486 m). On the tree-covered summit there is a stone cairn, the Steinernes K√∂ppl. Not far from the summit is a rock outcrop, the Schornsteinfelsen, from which it is possible to see the Rhine Plain.  Natural region  The Hochberg is part of the natural region of the Palatine Forest that, in the system by Emil Meynen and Josef Schmith√ºsen published in the Handbuch der naturr√§umlichen Gliederung Deutschland and its successor publications is classified as a major region of the 3rd order. Within the mountain range itself, it belongs to the Central Palatine Forest.  Access and footpaths  The mountain summit may be climbed on signed hiking trails from the Kropsburg to the east or from the Wegspinne by the St. Martiner Hut to the west.
